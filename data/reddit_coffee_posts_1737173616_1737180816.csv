 I am 20 F and I live Lima-Perú and I was born and raise in Trujillo-North Perú. I'm explaining this bcz is consider a bit countryside and the way of dating is different to other countries and a bit with the capital.

I live near to callao and Lovee visit La Punta-Callao, that is near to us navy and the peruvian navy, 2 weeks ago I started to talk with an American guy 25M who works in the us navy and We had dates in the beach, he tell me for a serious date like a coffee or a dinner not just walk so yesterday we visited a coffee shop and had a great conversation. I thought the date was nice but when arrive at home he text me for the cost of my coffee and a dessert like literally sent me the receipt with a message telling me about paying my part so I was so confused because was just a coffee.

 This NEVER happen to me because paying for dates is so basic in Perú so I answered something like hahahah is a good joke but He wasn't playing. Idk if pay the hole recipe and never accept another date bcz I'm a bit offended because after that he did some comments about latinas gold diggers of just understand the difference of culture and pay my 50% .

I asked to my friends and they are so pissed off about it, well they are from countryside so them just assumed that his gay so idk if that's a impartial opinion about this situation.

1i41280,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i41280,The Dr Patty Experience ,"Hi guys, I thought I would share in depth the procedure of my HT that I just had done and hopefully clear up any questions with it.

So like most people I did my research around 8 months ago to see who the best surgeon was, who would have realistic expectations and overall give me a natural hairline. It is quite common for people to go to turkey as they say it is cheaper, however I found this not to be the best option for me, as I am from Australia and getting to turkey can be a bit of a hassle.

I then started looking at Thailand and came across Dr patty, I researched her results and absolutely loved seeing them from people on this page, so I did a phone consultation to see the price and what it entails.

After discussing they let me know it would be around 3500 grafts and would cost around 130,000 baht, roughly $6000 and could book me in for January, and to start finasteride as soon as possible, as I was not on it yet. From then on I sent my deposit and did not have much communication until the day before the appointment.

They make you send through a covid test and show it’s negative and tell you to be at the clinic at 7am the next day. They also tell you that you must eat before surgery and not coffee and tea beforehand (which was the worst part as I am not a morning person). I arrived at the clinic around 10 minutes early, where they welcomed me and changed me into the surgical outfit.

From then on they wash your hair and blow dry it, take you to a photo room and take around 50 pictures of every angle possible. You then meet the amazing Dr Patty who has an amazing warm welcome and explains the procedure and its risks. She asks you to draw where you would like the hairline and then draws one on after. She makes sure you are happy with it and then asks her assistants if she thinks it looks good. Then following that she measures the area and calculates the costs and grafts.

After this you leave Dr patty and head to the front desk for payment, as well as get given Valium, antibiotics and pain relief tablet, as well as a sweet red cordial so you don’t pass out. Next, it’s shaving time (at least for me). They shaved my head fully infront of a mirror, then escorted me to the photo room again, where we took another 50 photos of every angle imaginable. But then it’s show time.

You’re escorted into the procedure room where you are told to lie down on the bed to get ready for the procedure to start.
The first stage: incision process 
They lay you down on your back facing up, they place gauze over your eyes so you are unable to see clearly which is kinda freaky but also was kind of relaxing sometimes, and they give you a nice warm blanket. 

They let you know they will start the injections now to numb the area. Now people say this is the worst part of the procedure, which I disagree on but will get onto it soon. This last around 30 seconds to a minute as they numb the front of your head and begin doing the incisions for where the hair follicles will go. This goes on for some time and then they flip you around and lay you on your stomach to do the extractions. They numb the area once again as you lay your face in the hole of chair/bench. This part is the easiest part, as the extraction feels like a tiny massage gun going over you scalp, I felt 0 pain on this whole part and nearly fell asleep. 

With 2/3rds of the procedure done, it’s time for a break. At this time it was around 1130am. They sent me to a room where they gave me my pad Thai I had ordered earlier, which tasted amazing as always and went to the bathroom, after this 10 minutes it’s time to get back in the operating room, lying on your back getting ready for the incisions. 

Now this part, for me, was hands down the worst part of the whole procedure. Because it went on. FOREVER. You are made to sit on a lying position with your head back for HOURS, while they place the grafts carefully into your head. I had some pain every now and again where they would inject some more local anaesthetic which fixed it right up. But being in the 1 position for so long is not my cup of tea, my legs were cramping up and my neck was aching from it being in the same positions continuously. Obviously this is not any of the clinics fault, as you can speak up at anytime, however I just wanted to push through it. Patty then looked at over all the grafts and made sure they all looked good and she was happy with the work.

They sat me up at the end and let me know how many grafts were placed, how many singles double and triples and complications which has risen. I had moderate graft popping and bleeding in 1 area of my scalp which they said they will keep an eye on in my follow ups. I got dressed and they wrapped the back of my head up in gauze, gave me post op instructions and some Valium for the night and scheduled an appointment for the next day as well as a little hat they give you to wear, which is basically a bandana that looks like a chef hat.

For the night I slept soooo well. Which is really good because this was my biggest fear. The Valium helped and I had 0 pain throughout the whole night, however had times felt veryyyy dizzy and even a little bit of brain fog following days that continued. I had a total of around 16 hours sleep, as wise man said “I just took a xan 13 hours till I land, had me out like a light (Ayee).” Anyway I digress, I went to a follow up appointment the next day where they showed how to wash my hair, washed it for me (which stung a litttttle) did more photos, bandaged the back of my head again due to some minor bleeding still  and said they were happy with the healing and to come back the next day and the day I leave to fly back.

The day I left Bangkok I did basically the same thing except see Dr Patty just before the hair wash, she said she he very excited to see how it will turn out and that I look good in green xxx. They gave me some extra Valium to help with the plane ride home and requested to keep them updated on the healing as per the post op instructions they give you said. 

Old say the hardest part in all of this is having to put the bandana on and off constantly whenever you want to leave to go outside, and having to be hyper-vigilant in not touching your head as well as the anxiety of messing things up. But other than that the whole thing was an absolute breeze, hopefully it turns out well and will update everyone in a few months.


TLDR; procedure went from 0800 - 230pm, around $6000AUD, around 3365 grafts. Injections weren’t that bad tbh, I’ve had worst. Worst part sitting still unable to move for hours and not knowing when it’s going to be over. Gonna look hot af (I hope)

1i410tn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i410tn,Friends no more- my roommate from HELL!! Don’t live with crazy! Could it have been handled differently… previously posted under AITA but figured it might be better to repost with the new tags up,"AITA? Roommate from Hell! Could I have handled it differently? Don’t live with crazy! Keep close to those shadows



Hello! This story is kind of a long one so buckle in if you’re up for it. Posted before but wrote it in notes and it didn’t transfer well so redoing for better spacing. First time ever posting on Reddit so I’m sorry if I’m doing it wrong.



   And hi Charlotte! If you ever happen to read this, I love watching your videos. Coming from a fellow people pleaser as this story will show, you remind me a lot of myself and I love that you’ve come so far from trying to let go of that. That’s something I need to get better at but it easier said than done. Congratulations on your engagement. You both look so cute together. 

Back to the story… It put me through a lot of stress at the time and made me sick to my stomach while it was going on but I’ve moved passed it now and am in a much better place

 

   So… I live in Hawaii now and it can be really hard to find a place to live over here. Moved here to be closer to family after Covid and not seeing them for a couple years as a result. Well after living with family for a few months and having to share a room with my sister, I was losing my mind. She’s not the crazy roommate, but I knew I needed to get my own place. 
 


   Well I met this girl when I was out one day… we’ll call her Ashley. This is while I was still living with family. She seemed alright, we became friends for a time. Hung out a couple of times both just the two of us and in a few group settings. In hindsight, a lot of people kind of warned me that she seemed off in some aspects but I try to see the best in people and be a decent person and I hadn’t had any problems with her at that point.
 


   She was needing a place too at the time and I was offered a place by a family friend to move into pretty quickly. Keep in mind there are a lot of rundown places out here, especially in the more jungle like areas of the island and I moved into a shack version of a shack on a coffee farm. It was a pretty rough spot. She moved in with me and we were there for a few months. She was going through some personal drama that I won’t get into because that’s not my place, but I gave her a lot of passes for her up and down moods and was an ear to her problems a lot.
   


  After a few months in the shack, which wasn’t necessarily the easiest or most comfortable living conditions, an opportunity to move into another much nicer place closer to the main town over here came up. Closer to my family who live just up the hill from me now and much closer to work instead of making the long drives in the morning and evenings. It’s a house that’s split between the upstairs and downstairs which is what I was moving into. The downstairs is a ONE BEDROOM. Now, because her and I were friends and I knew she wouldn’t feel comfortable living with strangers, especially men she might not know (the shack we were in was rented out on a room basis with 3 rooms there but we paid extra so it would just be the two of us), I offered to let her move with me to the new place. BIG MISTAKE. 


    At first we agreed and talked about how we would manage the living arrangement. I would take the bedroom and she would live in the living room with dividers that we planned to get to separate the space (the living area is pretty big and there was plenty of space to do this). I told her I could probably help get the dividers and I knew I’d be paying more for taking the bedroom. We talked about how the cost would be split. I would be paying 2/3 of the rent and we’d split the utilities. She came back later on and told me, she only wanted to pay a set amount every month which would have been 1/3 of the rent and none of the utilities because she didn’t have her own room. Fine, I didn’t want to argue on the matter. Whatever. 
  


  Eventually it was about time for us to move out and she said an opportunity came up for her to dog/house sit for a few months and asked if I would be okay if she didn’t move in with me after all. I told her, sure, that was fine. I figured then with it being just me, I wanted to order some things to make the new place more homely. I ordered some bookshelves, a tv stand to put the tv in the living room. Some things to fill in the space more so it wouldn’t feel so empty being just me. It was money I spent on things because I didn’t think she was going to move in with me after all.
 


   She ended up moving out of the original spot earlier than I did to start house sitting and it immediately fell through so she asked me if she could still live with me after all. I told her sure, but I spent money on other things thinking she wasn’t going to be joining me and I couldn’t afford to get the dividers. She moved in with me anyways and this begins my month of hell.



    My landlord was sweet and offered us some of the things in the house that were already in it. A small twin sized bed because Ashley didn’t have a bed and slept on my futon at the other house. A small desk and tiny dresser that were already here. Sheets and blankets for her to use. She barely owned anything and most of the things in the house were mine. 



   Right after we moved in, she quit her job and decided to work small side gigs instead like cleaning some of the local air B&Bs. And she met up with guys who would pay her to hang out with them. We didn’t have dividers, she lived in the open living room and me, feeling bad, spent most of my time in my bedroom so that she could have her privacy.  The bathroom has two doors, one to the main living area and a second sliding door to my bedroom. We also have a decent backyard and I have a door in the bedroom that leads to the backyard so I would use that a lot in the mornings to leave for work. Her mood changes at the new place got worse and worse and soon I found myself constantly walking on eggshells. 



Uncomfortable spending any time in the house besides my bedroom. She took up gardening in the backyard so it felt like she took that over too and I was basically paying a bunch of money to have a bedroom while she had the whole rest of the house and backyard and I was paying the utilities while I was gone at work a lot and she would spend all day at the house. 



Eventually she would have a guy that would come over for… you know, and I couldn’t even leave my bedroom to do so much as make coffee for myself. She’d make it and leave it for me in the bathroom. He came in late at night and wouldn’t even leave until like noon. Honestly, I was going stir crazy and grew to hate the living situation. I didn’t trust talking to her unless she spoke to me first because I wasn’t sure what mood she would be in. And eventually she began throwing the dividers in my face, holding it over my head. Like, you need to get this! You said you were going to get it! Which was something I said I could help with before I spent money on other things and before she had said she only wanted to pay a certain amount and none of the utilities basically. I didn’t have the money. 



    But she kept pushing and pushing and I was over it. I was looking at dividers on Amazon trying to find good ones after one particularly pushy day from her. Saved some for ideas (they were not cheap by any means) and wanted to get her input before I ordered it. Well I got home that day using the back door to enter my bedroom and had to go into the kitchen for something. Wasn’t sure what mood she was in so I wasn’t going to say anything. She said hi to me though so I thought it was okay and stupidly approached her with my phone to show her some of the dividers I found. She paused for a moment and then helped me measure the area and we picked it out and I ordered it on my credit card. I thought the issue would be resolved and things would mellow out and get better now that that was ordered and set to come. How WRONG I was. I was keeping to myself in my bedroom later that same night when she began to BLOW UP on me! 
 


   Like how dare I approach and talk to her. She didn’t want to talk to me. I should have texted her if I needed to talk to her about something. (I wasn’t even going to say anything but thought it would be okay to talk about it when she said hi to me and messaged me earlier that day holding over my head the fact that I said I’d get the dividers so I’m probably an idiot for that) She doesn’t have to talk to me all the time. Oh, I’m so controlling or pushing her boundaries because I entered her space which was not okay. She didn’t like that my stuff was in the living area and couldn’t deal with hoarder energy (this wasn’t the case. 



    Sure  some of my things were there like the futon and the  2 bookshelves with knickknacks and a smaller bookshelf with my records and record player lined up on the wall but I was just trying to make a nice comfortable living area that I already felt like I couldn’t spend time in. And everything in the kitchen was mine) and more of my things needed to go into my bedroom. She was in her self care era and how I needed to respect that. She said I was a liar or not true to my word because I bought other things instead of the dividers like I said I would and my word basically means nothing. According to her, I owed her… despite her eating my food, using up and taking some of my expensive products and makeup and my essential oils and my cleaning supplies, etc.



    She ALSO said she WOULD NOT be paying rent until the dividers came and that did floor me a bit. We had been there almost a month at this point, rent was due in a few days and the dividers would not arrive for like two weeks. I had just put a couple hundred dollars towards the divider to get a large one with a curtain. I could only manage to get one at the time and she talked her friend into helping her get the other one, but it was still a lot of money. Financials were a bit tight but I could manage. She also refused to pay rent until she was put on the lease… now my landlord did not want to put her on the lease after she decided she wasn’t going to move in with me and then suddenly she was. So I knew that wasn’t going to happen. She was kind of written on the lease on the side with her info as being kind of a sub tenant to me. 



    I was already so over it and sick to my stomach and uncomfortable with the whole living situation. There was some back and forth, but eventually I said something along the lines of, “this doesn’t appear to be working out. I’ve tried to help you and nothing I do is good enough. Going to cancel the dividers. Rent is due soon, either help or I don’t want you around anymore” (I’ll see if I can add some of the message screen texts. It gets pretty bad). This was my last message to her. She kept blowing up my phone with some of the worst messages she could think of to hurt me but I never responded again. I ABSOLUTELY canceled the order for the divider… Because I’m true to my word.
  


  Eventually she agreed to move out but told me she would be out by a certain date and I was not allowed back into my home until she was gone because she didn’t want to see my face. Made a bunch of rude insults to me, talked about how she suddenly has a great opportunity coming up that she would have had if I weren’t so awful. How she’s moving onto better things and I made her life better. 



     I was receiving all of this at work and couldn’t focus. Was sick to my stomach about things going on at the house. Even went to the police station to find out what my options were. Didn’t really have many at the time. My landlord though was made aware of the situation and how she was talking about how she was about to have a free place to live. Told me I absolutely had to go home because she was worried she would try to push me out of my house and squat there. I needed to anyways because she turned out to be a kleptomaniac and I didn’t trust her not to rob me or run up my bills out of spite. Landlord said if she had anyone over that night, to let her know and her and my dad and my stepmom (who she’s friends with) would come down to the house with chairs and drinks. I went straight home after work and went in through my bedroom door and stayed there for a bit.



   Well! She did have a friend of hers over that night. I knew the guy was harmless and poor guy had a thing for her which she used to her advantage to get things from him, but I told them regardless and down to the house they did in fact come. Her and her friend were at the picnic bench in the backyard and we set up with chairs and a cooler just a few feet away chatting casually paying them no mind.  



   You could tell they were uncomfortable and eventually they went inside, closed all the curtains and you could hear some rustling around. She packed and left THAT NIGHT. I took the next day off from work and did not leave until the day hit a couple days later that she said she would be out of the house by and changed those locks! Figured that way I wouldn’t get into legal trouble in case she tried to enter the premises before then because she was technically a tenant and probably would have had rights up to her move out date.


   I still live here. The energy has definitely shifted and I’m much happier without the toxicity she brought into my life. There are some things I’ve noticed that she stole from me, but it could have been worse and I don’t have to deal with her anymore.




Sorry it’s so long. I tried to give context and the whole situation was a lot. AITA? Was I in the wrong with the dividers? Could it have been handled differently? Wish I listened when others said they had a bad vibe from her but it happened and it’s over. Can only take the lesson learned and move on.


Note: I have a cat but absolutely can’t have dogs on property. She brought a dog over to dog sit and had a makeshift leash sitting in the backyard. When my landlord asked about it because she comes by to maintain the property, she caught Ashley in a lie claiming it was for my cat who is a completely indoor cat.",2,1737179704.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False
1i40z9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/u__xDx/comments/1i40z9z/my_story_finding_a_cure_for_dientamoeba_fragilis/,My story finding a cure for Dientamoeba Fragilis parasite,"The following is my story of curing dientamoeba fragilis after picking it up in Bali and suffering for over 4 months. It's what worked in my particular case for my particular body. It's not medical advice, has no recommendations and notes that we're all different and will get mixed outcomes, but if sharing this helps just one person get insight on this debilitating condition then job done.

I'll outline:

\- Diet amendments that reduced my particular symptoms  
\- Natural remedies I tried that didn't cure it  
\- Antibiotics I used, Secnidazole + Parmomoycin, which are clinically recommended, that killed it

*Step 1) Diet Change Reduced My Symptoms*

* My symptoms included Constant diarrhoea, nausea, fatigue, shaking hands, couldn't think straight and short term memory was off. At times mild anxiety and mild vertigo, usually at night in bed. Some days I was unable to get out of bed let alone drive a car. I lost 5kg in the first 8 weeks.


* About 3 months in, I learned about diet and removed ANY sugar, food that mostly breaks down into sugar, bread/grains, dairy, sugary fruit, and processed foods.


* Switched to a paleo type diet of lean meat, egg (non vego/vegans only of course), vegetables, salad with low oil levels


* Got through  5 days of sugar withdrawals hell (sugar is like crack! I used fruit as a crutch but cut it out after a week) and got used to having to cook more and eat a boring menu for a little while.


* I was strict with this and within a week I was rewarded with my day to day debilitation and sickness reducing by about 50% and instead of being fatigued and sick in bed, I could be productive for about 2-4 hours in the day and gave me hope. It didn't stop having constant soft stool though.


* I tried removing more things like coffee, legumes or red meat but they didn't seem to matter so left them in. 


* I tried reintroducing a little bit of dairy and was ok with a little milk in my tea and some greek yoghurt but when I tried to cheat and ate a little chocolate, I was sick all afternoon, lesson learned. I was able to maintain a healthy weight once I had this in place. 


*Step 2) Tried anti parasite natural remedies with no obvious benefits*

* With my diet improved I then tried the following natural remedies that I had been recommended for a month in the hope something would work and I would not need harmful antibiotics... or they would at least weaken the parasite. None of this cured me, whether it weakened the parasite in prep for the antibiotics... I don't know.

   * Cayenne Pepper capsules (take with food, causes a little discomfort)
   * Clove powder
   * Chopped fresh garlic (warn your partner before kissing)
   * Wormwood
   * Black walnut
   * Pomegranate husk powder
   * Berberine capsules
   * Oregano oil capsules
   * MCT Oil
   * Biofilm busters - NAT capsules (or ALC) & Klaire Labs Interphase Plus


* They didn't seem to have any obvious side effects on me, aside from a little nausea only if all taken together. Would I take them again? Probably not.


* Reference Material: Find out more about natural remedies from this herbalist in Byron Bay Australia who has a fair bit of info on his website [https://www.byronherbalist.com.au/parasite-infections/dientamoeba-fragilis-protozoan-parasite/](https://www.byronherbalist.com.au/parasite-infections/dientamoeba-fragilis-protozoan-parasite/)



*Step 3) A combination of simultaneous antibiotics* ***Secnidazole and Paromomycin over 10 days - this worked in my case***

* With my diet in play for about 6 weeks, a month of natural remedies under my belt in the hope (unproven) they weakened the parasite, I reluctantly had a go at antibiotics after a previous failed attempt with Metronizadole (aka Flagyl, Metrogyl) that didn't work and had nasty side effects. Note that my failure with Metronizadole could be attributed to the fact I took it in isolation, I stopped after 5 days as it made me too sick rather than completing the full course. I have seen another post on Reddit from a fellow that was cured by taking Metronizadole + Parmomoycin, however he noted being sick with side effects during the course here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IBSHelp/comments/vndub9/comment/ikk87d7](https://www.reddit.com/r/IBSHelp/comments/vndub9/comment/ikk87d7)


* FYI  Secnidazole and Parmomoycin may not be readily available. I am in Australia and they are not on the PBS (government approved list), but my GP could prescribe them and have a compounding chemist make them up within 24 hours ($75 AUD each in 2024). My GP is older and was around in the 80's when they were more common so was happy to issue a script after I accepted the side effect risks, however, most of the younger doctors in the clinic had no idea about them and would not issue a script and just point to Metronizadole, which is on the PBS.


* My only side effect while taking them was a weird headache sometimes in the top of my head and light fatigue, especially in the early evening, but otherwise, nothing! After suffering through me prior Metronizadole course (nausea, fatigue, anxiety, couldn't think right) and considering I was taking two dugs at the same time I thanked my lucky stars every single day. Everyone is different though, some people are fine with Metro AND on the other hand, I spoke to one lady who got IBS for 4 years after a few rounds of antibiotics for her DF case the poor thing, so this may be a unique outcome for each person. There is no silver bullet it seems.


* After about 3 days my DF symptoms started to go away, after day 6 stool was back to normal, I still felt some fatigued though all through it but could go to the gym again 3 days in a row for a light weights workout as long as I didn't do cardio, which ran me down and still did about a week after treatment.


* Coming off the antibiotics I engaged in prebiotics and probiotics. Unfortunately I felt nausea within about 24 hours of the last tablet. It was different from DF nausea though which gave me hope and it wasn't surprised given the bug shift coming off the drugs and introducing probiotics. 


* I had IBS symptoms and indigestion for about a week and strictly continued diet restriction and removing all oil and using Mylanta (antacid) helped a heap. This went away after a week.


* As at mid January 2025, I am 20 days post antibiotics and have my life back, eat whatever I like and despite still being at about 70% energy levels of pre parasite days, that I will regain in the next month I expect. I'll post again over time if anything changes.


**Conclusion**   
As at mid January 2025,  I am 20 days post antibiotics and have my life back, eat whatever I like and despite still being at about 75% energy levels of pre parasite days, that I will regain in the next month I expect. I'll post again over time if anything changes.


One other factor that helped get me through this was mental health support from those around me. I went to some dark places after having it for months, reading stories about people who had it for years and especially had to stop working as I could no longer think straight and had anxiety about losing my income. 


Please make sure you get helpful support, and be selective about who you tell as many people wanted to shove their wacky magical cureall natural remedies down my throat or told me all about worst case scenarios. Don't do it alone but don't let unhelpful people make you feel worse. 


As with anything, do your own research, I'm just a random guy on Reddit so don't take my experience as fact or a recommendation, our bodies are all very different. The above is anecdotal so take it as such. I've listed some scientific references and studies below that I collated along the way to get you started on your own fact-finding.

* In the above study, you will note that Doxycycline was found to be ineffective when used in isolation and I chose not to use it.


* Here is a study of Secnidazole used for DF: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14629268](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14629268) note that this was a single does, it was used in isolation and not in combination with another drug. The point that stood out to me though was that test candidates reported no side effects except 1 person, which was my experience also with it and a key reason I personally chose it. I have seen some studies where it is shown as more effective in isolation than Metronizadole and another study where it was less effective, so make your own mind up.


* Parmomoycin *seems* to be the most effective drug in all studies I reviewed online like the one above. Parmomycin was also used in all *personal anecdotal (not scientific studies)* stories shared with me from other people who were cured after taking it in combination with a one of the several nitroimidazole antibiotics that are very simlar (aka Metronidazole, Ornidazole, Tinizadole or Secnidazole see more here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitroimidazole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitroimidazole) ) or, in one case Parmomomycin + Doxycycline for 10 days. 


* Metronidazole is readily available on the PBS in Australia and may be initially recommended to you by a GP. I chose not to use it again as it lasts only around  8 hours in the body compared to Secnidazole (20 hours plus) and due to the side effects I experienced. I don't know anything about the other nitroimidazole versions.
* I have seen some stories about people using Clioquinol but don't know anything about it.

>Unrivaled's opening night might prove as impactful off the court as on it: As WNBA free agency looms, Miami has become the go-to location for player pitches. The players themselves have acted as team proxies through training camp and the preseason, buying coffees for pending free agents, selling them on their respective teams and painting a picture of what it could be like to team up in the W.

>Opening night was littered with WNBA team executives, including Dallas Wings coach Chris Koclans and assistant general manager Jazmine Thomas, Phoenix Mercury's Nate Tibbetts and Nick U'Ren, and Seattle Storm assistant coach Pokey Chatman. WNBPA president Nneka Ogwumike was also in attendance. Multiple players have likened being at Unrivaled to being a part of Team USA or in the WNBA bubble, where women from all different teams are put into tight quarters and can one, learn from each other, but two try and get them to team up. *\[note that that sentence needed an editor it never found\]*

>Satou Sabally, who announced she has played her last game in Dallas, said multiple players have bought her cups of coffee, and Breanna Stewart told her she would look good in New York seafoam.

I'll try to remember to update this as things progress.

(1) I opened a Capital one savings account in September 2024, followed shortly after by a Checking Account in the same month. Since becoming a customer, I have been completely locked out of both accounts. (2) I have been forced to endure dozens of hours of customer service calls, lies, and resubmission of highly sensitive identity verification documentation, only to end up making no progress. There are zero branches within hundreds of miles of where I live and there is no way to contact these people other than their customer service phone numbers, Café’s with “ambassadors” who are just there to answer basic questions and open accounts, and US mail, none of which provide any means to access my bank accounts. (3) As a result of Capital One’s actions, there has been a number of legal violations, including, but not limited to, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, violation of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts or Practices, violation of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, violation of applicable CFPB regulations, violations of applicable state and federal banking laws, violation of applicable FTC laws regulations regarding Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices, and violation of applicable laws and regulations under state and federal antitrust and competition laws, and violation of applicable federal and state privacy laws. (4) My husband has had a Capital One Venture Credit Card since at least 2018 and he issued me my own credit card under his account. At that time, I still had my maiden name, “\[Maiden Name\]”.  (5) Around August 2023, I changed my last name to  
“\[Complainant Current Last Name\]”. I contacted Capital One and requested they update my information and issue me a new credit card. Shortly after that, I received a new credit card with “\[Complainant Name\]” stamped on the card. (6) Upon using the card, I noticed that the receipt still had “\[Complainant Maiden Name\]” and also noted that the credit card statements did as well. I include this information because I suspect that this is the root cause of the issue preventing me from accessing my accounts. (7) I tried to create an online account in order to resolve this. I was required to submit verification documents and was told that Capital One will contact me. They did not. I contacted customer service and would go through a process whereby they would require me to submit documents and would promise a follow-up contact from them within 2-3 business days. Invariably, I would never hear back and the problem would persist. (8) After “wising up,” I contacted Capital One customer service to explain that the process was broken and that the issue needs to be escalated. These calls always resulted in failure or false promises. Eventually, I let it go because I had wasted so much time on this issue to no avail. (9) More recently in September 2024, I opened a new savings and checking account with Capital One. At this time, I was prompted by Capital One to create my online account to be able to access my accounts. Once again, I dutifully followed their instructions, including resubmitting highly sensitive identity verification documentation, and was told that I would hear back from them soon. As expected, I would never hear back from anyone. (10) As I did previously, I called customer service and experienced the exact same issues I did previously—every call comprised of some combination of being patronized that I was doing something wrong, completely ignoring my detailed explanations of the nature of the problem and forcing me to resubmit to the same exact broken process, lying to me that the problem has been addressed, and lying to me that they have escalated the issue and that I would hear back about a resolution within a day or two. (11) On one of these calls, I was told that it would be helpful to use the “complaints and feedback” form on the Capital One website online because that would help get my issue addressed. After the call, I went to their website, found “complaints and feedback” (available here: https://www.capitalone.com/help-center/contact-us/feedback/), and just when I thought I could not be surprised by this company anymore, I was confronted with another ironic twist—the webpage consists of two lines that triggered unimaginable dread: “General customer support line Call customer support at 1-844-348-8660.” That’s right—Capital One customer support directed me to submit a complaint via the “complaints and feedback” webpage, which directed me to call the very same customer support number. (12) It was at this stage that I pinched myself several times to make sure I was not, in fact, having a nightmare. As of the date of this submission to the CFPB, all evidence points to the conclusion that, despite having the hallmarks of a Kafkaesque delusion eclipsing the everlasting condemnation of Sisyphus himself, this is the reality of being a Capital One customer. (13) In December 2024, it became clear there was one remaining option—spend my entire afternoon going to a physical Capital One branch because surely they would be able to help me, or at least help me get my case escalated to the right person. (14) I went to the Capital One Locations webpage (available here: https://locations.capitalone.com/), typed in my zip code and filtered by “branch.” I was aghast. I applied for these accounts as a resident in Chicago, the third most populated city in the United States, and this bank had ZERO branch locations within 50 miles—which is the widest radius their webpage lets you search. I continued to search all major cities in the Midwest, only to get the same result. In other words, there are zero Capital One Branch locations within a 400+ mile radius of the great city of Chicago. (15) The next alternative was to go to a “Capital One Café,” which “do not have all the same services that branches do” but, according to Capital One, is a place to unwind, get coffee, use a work space, or talk to a “Café Ambassador,” which is a human that works for Capital One. I set aside my Saturday in early December 2024 and went to the closest Capital One Café (https://www.capitalone.com/local/chicago-southport/). (16) I explained to the Café Ambassador my issue. Of course, he was unable to help me, but was happy to connect me with the right people at Capital One. We sat down together and he proceeded to call Capital One, be placed on hold, explain the situation to someone, and be bounced around—this happened a handful of times. After enduring this for the greater part of an hour, he handed me the phone. This process repeated itself. (17) I ended experiencing the same thing this time as I did before—I went through the same steps to verify my identity and yet again providing highly sensitive identity verification documentation. I was told that my issue was resolved. We tried to set up the online account at that time and, once again, the process failed. At this point, as before, we were told that someone would follow up with us in a matter of a few days. We left the Café and I never heard back from anyone since then. (18) It is clear now that I have effectively been locked out of accessing my financial accounts in violation of terms of service and applicable laws resulting in damages.",6,1737178690.0,Banking,2,1.0,False

I realized this has been a pattern going on for a few years, but I wasn't willing to admit it until now. She reached out a few days ago asking to meet over coffee because she wants to mend things. How can I tell her that I don't want to without being an ass? I don't really want to hurt her feelings, and I don't wish ill on her or anything. I really do have a lot of memories I'll look back on fondly! But because of that I do not want to meet with her in person; I think I'll cave and lie that it's okay and begin the cycle again.

We were completely in tune with each other and always experienced separation anxiety. I refused to spend the night anywhere. Her cage was smooshed up to my bed. Every morning when I woke up and rolled over she would slam the side of the cage in excitement. I’d make two cups of coffee and lay in bed and cuddle with her. Cuddling was our favorite thing. 
She had a lot of health issues crop up in 2020. I hand fed her supplemental food for 4 years, 8 months and 8 days.

She would have these hormonal episodes, have discharge, and feel better after a few days. I question if she had wet tail. It is killing me that I could have saved her with a simple antibiotic.

1i40qhj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i40qhj/how_do_i_21_f_get_closure_from_my/,How do I (21 F) get closure from my sitiuationship(22 M)?,"TLDR; I (21F) had a rocky situationship with a close friend (22M) where we were exploring feelings for each other but never defined it. After a falling out with my parents in December, I moved out, and he distanced himself, saying I should focus on fixing things with my family. Now that my life is stable, the heartbreak is hitting hard. He’s showing up in my dreams, I’ve been avoiding sleep, and it’s taking a toll on me emotionally. I want closure, but I’m unsure if it’s fair to ask for it or if I should just move on. What should I do?

I (21F) don’t usually do relationships. I had a friend from my college friend group (22M) who I’d known for about a year and a half. He asked me out in February, but I said no. We stayed friends, but by September, something shifted for me, and I started seeing him in a different light. I asked him out, and we decided to explore things together.

It wasn’t a defined relationship—it was more of a situationship. We were into each other and spent time together, but it felt a little rocky as we tried to figure out if we were on the same page. For me, relationships are uncharted territory, and I was still learning what I wanted. He, on the other hand, seemed to be looking for something serious right away.

Despite the uncertainties, we shared some really special moments. We’d go on drives, visit lakes, and watch the autumn leaves (which I love). In the winter, he took me to see the lights. He learned my favorite songs on the guitar, we visited bookstores, and we’d grab coffee together. He never even had to ask how I took my coffee—he just knew. He’s a private person, and I knew that from being friends first. But during this time, he let me into his life, showing me the deeper parts of who he is. That made it even more special and now makes it even harder. I’d never felt as comfortable with anyone as I did with him. I could cry in front of him or fall asleep in his car without feeling self-conscious. He made me feel safe and like I could share my problems without being a burden.

Then, in December, I had a major falling out with my parents. It’s a long story, but they found out about him, and I ended up moving out of my family home. When I told him, he said I shouldn’t contact him until I sorted things out with my family. At the time, I was so consumed with everything else going on that I didn’t give much thought to his reaction. Thankfully, I had an amazing support system outside of him—friends who showed up for me and made sure I wasn’t alone—so I was able to get through that time without depending on him too much.

For the past month, we’ve had minimal contact. Since we share a friend group, we’ve checked in on each other indirectly, but he’s become very distant. Now that my life has stabilized, the heartbreak is really hitting me. We never defined what we were, so it doesn’t feel like a breakup, but it still hurts deeply. We didn’t have a proper conversation about what happened, and while his silence feels like an answer, I know I need closure.

What’s making it worse is how much this is affecting me emotionally and physically. He’s been showing up in my dreams lately, and it’s something that didn’t happen before when he was still in my life. Now I wake up in a bad mood, and it’s making it harder to sleep. I’ve started avoiding sleep just to avoid dreaming about him, but it’s taking a toll on me.

I feel like I need to sit down with him, express how I feel, and let him know that for my own healing, I’ll need to block him for a while. It’s not out of anger—I just need space to move on because this hurts so much. Our mutual friends have mentioned he’s struggling too, but I’m stuck on how to move forward.

How do I approach this? What’s the best way to handle the situation? Should I reach out to have this conversation and explain how I feel, or would it be better to focus on moving forward without it? I’d really appreciate any advice from others who’ve been through something similar.

so afraid of myself 
i used to be curious and thoughful
but my mind is now a scramble. I infact do not think much. mush. jumbled.
it certainly isn’t bright or related to any semblance of wonder. it feels like my brain is swollen and mashed into pieces. it feels like i float behind or above myself in the viscous brain juice, tryingto stay afloat or keep up. like a constant hear stroke. altered mental state. delirium. everything is blurry, slanted, loud, bright, and static. nothing is clear, ever. how can reality continue like that for such time. really. 

I don’t crave substances anymore because my brain is a swollen mush already, and my stomach is raw and untamable. 

but I did have a thought about using them enough to warrant treatment. see I don’t WANT to fuck my family up and off myself. I just want to get pulled over for a DUI or lose my job for being high at work-enough for them to mandate rehab. a grippy sock vacation. time away from all of this mold. these unsorted boxes. the man in my ear telling me nothing I feel could possibly be truth. would treatment even help? I’m not sure. but accountability and attention. a babysitter.

an old friend messaged me from the psych ward and I told him he was lucky. I guess you could say I have a few resentments. this I know. 

but I am in the real world, and I cannot cook myself dinner, my wrists are too sore from use. I cannot brush my own teeth, i’m too dizzy to stand. I cannot get up in the morning and say “hello world” and make my coffee, and go about the day. I wake up writhing in pain, grinding my teeth, clenching my muscles and worrying about the next 12 hours. those hours in which I will accomplish the bare minimum, the things that will prevent the house from burning down or my boss from firing me. sometimes, even those lines blur. 

you tell me, how could one joy? would you? do you even believe me? 

because the one person I have in my wheelhouse doesn’t, or perhaps doesn’t care, or perhaps cares only slightly. I mean to say, my needs are not met. he tells me they are too many. sometimes he gets it, and he’s sorry, and he makes promises that will not get met. he will complain about the unsorted boxes, but there will be no shelves to sort them onto. he will agree to the lack of affection, but it will be my fault, somehow.

and how could I live. without him. when I cannot use my wrists to stir a pan, how can I move my boxes? and my furniture? park the uhaul? how will I find a place I can afford? I have $500 to my name. 

I had once supportive parents, though they have turned into emotionally manipulative, bitter bitter people, tied up in a very nasty divorce after 35 years. only I saw it coming. 

do you see how this feels as though the world, in my eyes, is ending? because where should I do? who will help me? who will love me? should I take the semblance of love he offers and hold onto it for dear life? 

as even if I could stand on my own two feet, slowly but surely, and find myself in a place to build an entirely new connection with another human being (rare when your brain and body are on fire), I am the ugliest I have ever been, even in my prime. 

I have gained weight. my hair is a mess. my nails are a mess. my body is asymmetrical. my teeth are crooked. I am disgusted by my own mouth and genitals. I imagine the rest of the world is too. I never feel clean. I never feel beautiful. I am 21, meant to be in my “prime”, though I know this terminology upholds the concept of my existence as a sex object for men who want to procreate, or whatever. 

the advice is normally simple, and yet, I always find a reason why the world is coming to an end. I simply rot. I will rot until and unless another human being lifts me out of this broken bed and forces me into a program of treatment and recovery. helps me get the tabs on the car. manages the pain. thickens the brain mash. you get the gist.

**1. Jade**

The boy on the operating table was fifteen. His records said he had “volunteered,” but Jade Asher had seen too many files to believe the words written in tidy black ink. Voluntary didn’t account for parents who signed away their children to pay off debts, or the silent desperation of kids who didn’t know any other way out.

Her scalpel hovered in the sterile air, her fingers steady by force of habit. Yet her mind wasn’t in the room—it was with the image burned into her memory: Connor Lassiter, standing in front of a news camera, shielding his younger siblings with nothing but his body and his defiance.

*""You want me? Fine. But you don’t touch them.""*

It had been broadcast live across the country—Connor, unarmed, facing down a crowd of angry onlookers who saw only “unwinders,” blaming his family for the trauma they had endured. They didn’t care about the truth—they saw the labels and categories and immediately assigned guilt. But Connor, instead of retreating or letting his family become targets of the mob, stepped forward and drew a line in the sand.

The moment the camera captured his words, Jade’s world stopped. There was no surrender, no apology. Just defiance, pure and raw. And something more—an impulse to protect, to fight back. It was so unexpected and bold that it made her stomach twist. AWOLs weren’t supposed to *defend* anyone, especially their families. But Connor had. His family was his priority, and he would go to any lengths to defend them from the hate that had been directed their way.

Jade sat frozen in front of her TV, her heart pounding. She had always justified her work as a surgeon, compartmentalized the horrors of unwinding. She had told herself it wasn’t personal. But Connor’s stance—so public, so human—struck her in a way nothing else ever had. Unwinds weren’t just patients. They were *people*.

Jade didn’t return to work the next day. Or the day after that.

Her decision to quit was immediate, impulsive even, but it felt right. She couldn’t go back to being the doctor who casually saw children as nothing more than bodies to fix or “process.” She couldn’t justify the system any longer. The truth was that her hands had been just as guilty as the people who had made the decisions.

That night, Jade packed her things, took down the picture of her family from the wall, and left the hospital. She would never go back. The world had changed for her in the span of a few minutes—watching Connor risk it all for his family had been the catalyst.

Months later, Jade found herself in a small, rundown diner in Virginia, near the coast, staring out at the waves crashing against the pier. She hadn’t stopped searching for the remnants of the ADR since that moment, following every lead she could find. But the trail was cold. And her anger had only grown, like a fire she couldn’t put out.

She had heard rumors of doctors who still helped AWOLs, of families hiding children in small towns by the shore. There were whispers of safe houses, of people fighting back against a system that had betrayed its citizens. The ADR might have collapsed, but Jade was determined to help rebuild it, even if she had to do it alone.

The door to the diner swung open, and Jade looked up, not expecting much more than another dead-end lead. But then she saw him.

Connor Lassiter.

He was sitting in the back booth, his gaze down, a cup of coffee in front of him. His clothes were weathered, his hair a little longer than she remembered. The tension in the room shifted the moment she entered, the kind of electric energy that told her—without a doubt—that he was exactly who she was looking for.

But there was no sign of a grand entrance. Connor didn’t stand up to greet her. Instead, he stayed quietly in his seat, like a man who knew how to blend in, how to survive in the shadows. It made sense—he was still a fugitive.

Jade hesitated before walking toward him. She stood just outside the booth for a moment, trying to steady her nerves. He glanced up, his eyes sharp as ever, his gaze locking onto hers.

“You looking for someone?” he asked, his voice low but calm.

Jade swallowed, her heart racing. “Not someone. Something.”

Connor raised an eyebrow. “That’s vague.”

Jade took a deep breath, sitting across from him. “I’ve been searching for remnants of the ADR. I want to help start it again.”

Risa Ward, who had been sitting quietly beside him, looked over at Jade with skepticism. But it was Connor who spoke.

“Why?”

Jade’s fingers tightened around the edge of the table as she gathered her thoughts. “Because I was part of the system that hurt kids like you. And I can’t live with that anymore. I want to make it right.”

Connor stared at her, his expression unreadable. The seconds stretched, and for a moment, Jade feared he would refuse, dismissing her as another well-meaning but naive stranger.

Finally, he nodded, slowly.

“Sit down,” he said. “Start talking.”",1,1737177794.0,UnWinds,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone,

So I’ve been working on a small project in my free time—a digital version of the coffee passport (based on the UK one). As everyone in my store kept forgetting to bring there one from home. Right now, it’s a basic concept as I didn’t want to go too far without seeing if people actually would want it, and what features people would like to see.

So if I do go ahead I would obviously add a login system etc, but what else could I add/ what would you want? But also, is it actually worth pursuing?

This is purely a personal project for fun—I’m not making any money from it, and I hope this isn’t considered self-promo and if it is just let me know and I will take it down. I’m just curious about whether it’s worth expanding on and thought here might have some great ideas!

Here’s the link if you’re curious: [Digital Coffee Passport](https://giiiy.github.io/DigitalCoffeePassport/)

1i40gcs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i40gcs/am_i_being_breadcrumbed_or_is_does_she_just_have/,Am I being breadcrumbed or is does she just have crippling shyness,"Just to set a context I work at a golf course and I am a cart boy. Now to begin I matched with a girl on tinder and tinder. She liked by beach shirtless picture and I messaged her first. Our conversation was okay but I noticed that she didn’t ask questions back and she didn’t engage much. During the conversation I tried a little playful back and fourth about the show she watched and I don’t think she took it well and she told me to “be nice” then when I gave her a compliment on how she regularly attends the gym she said “that was sweet” and put a heart on the message. It was like she texted with a word count limit. I eventually said she could join me at a coffee shop in a few days since I would be working there and she told that she would be hanging out with friends that day but if she wasn’t she would come and join me. I told her that Id be there anyways since I would be doing some work. Come the next day Im at the coffee shop about to leave and I text her how is the game going. She gives me a dry answer and screenshots the score when I ask who was playing. I make a joke about the game results made people loose money on draft kings. She didn’t respond and I didn’t text anything back because I don’t double text or like one sided engagements or what people would call pulling teeth. Come five days later she texted me “are you working”, I decided to wait to respond and I saw her in the pro shop with her much older other male colleague. I walk past them and say what’s up and I say what’s up to the girl. She turned around and said hi. In the shop she nervously glanced at me while I was inside taking care of business because I’m on the clock. Also know she works in the office part of the golf course because my golf course is pretty famous. She left with her male colleauge and went back to her office part of the building. I texted her back that yes I was working that day and she laughed and said I know I saw you here. We conversed for a little over text. Then an hour later Im at the podium with my coworker/buddy and she walks past me and onto the putting green where her colleagues are. When she walks past me she glances at me awkwardly with head down. While she’s there with her colleagues shes watching and glancing at me frequenly. I text her minutes later “Come stop by the podium, I haven’t actually met the person behind text messages.” Also know for all out texts (She always texts back very fast and within the minute). I then walk over to her and her colleagues and I formally introduce myself to her and we speak briefly. We have a little laugh but she docent ask questions back. I ask her why she Isint putting with them and she jokes and says she is there for emotional support. During the convo she did stand by me while her coworkers are putting around the green away from us and her body was facing mines. She kept looking at me then down then at me then down again and again. Her coworkers come to us because we’re talking at the next hole and I speak to her male colleague. We had a short conversation with a few laughs and we exchange names. In the corner of my eye I see her observing me like a proctor while talking to her male colleauge. I tell them both I gotta run because I saw customers coming in and said it was nice meeting them. When watching her with her male colleagues she seemed like the little sister that gets told and bossed around. While leaving I heard them tell her to go to the garage and lock up their golf equipment and she mumbled okay. Its like she just follows the pack and can only operate within a group. Minutes later she texted “Now you did” in response to my earlier text saying “Come stop by the podium before you leave, we haven’t actually met the person behind text messages.” I text her back “You are still welcomed to come by” and “Well there was no customers and it was getting boring”. She texted back to me “I would have but me and my colleagues decided to go to the golf course”. (The response she gave me sounded like a bs deflection to not initiate conversation). I started texting back later and later about office rivalries since there are many entities at my golf course. She gave basic responses and I was leading the short conversation. On her last message I reacted to it with a thumbs up and left it alone. As she was leaving she walked past the podium, I turned around and waved and said “have a good one” she then waved back and said “have a good weekend” while she was on the phone.

Yes she is shy and reserved but good lord they at least make some kind of effort to engage or initiate contact. I believe that people, even shy people can make communication in some way like asking questions back is an elementary language skill. Not to mention she does things with a group or with male colleagues like a text she sent to me why she was in the pro shop was “the guys wanted to take a trip to the pro shop so she came with them”.  I came up was that she has crippling shyness. My second theory was that she was breadcruming for attention which I will not stand for. Im definitely going to pull back from her more that what I have been doing. I ain’t sending back another text to her, If she texts it’s going to be short and “some” minutes later. If we cross paths in person I will just say “hey” and keep it pushing. What do y’all think about my situation, is it shyness or is it just breadcruming or both???

Steven and Rose were at Target getting things for Steven's first day of school, which was in a week. Rose had enrolled her son in California Elementary School. Steven was excited, but nervous because of his past experiences with kids making fun of him when he was seven.

Steven and his mother parked at the store to get school supplies.

Steven and Rose walked in, they were in the back-to-school aisle, and Steven saw a shopping cart pass by him at full speed.

Steven sees a very chubby kid with two front buck teeth, no ears, short blond hair, and pink skin, (except on the shoulders and the torso which is a bright yellowish-apricot color, where his clothes usually cover him). He wears a neon green T-shirt with short purple sleeves, blue shorts, and dark blue boots.

The second boy used to have long hair all that was left now were tiny strands, He had a big forehead, small, and somewhat crooked teeth, with spaces in between some, and big eyes and big pupils as well. The boy wears a black t-shirt, cut-off jean shorts, and dark red boots.

The third boy has an enormous rounded square head, brown hair, a bright cyan t-shirt, and tan-yellow shorts. He wears very tall socks, along with dark blue sandals. He also seems to be very skinny.

""CLARENCE!"" the second boy said, laughing, The third boy was trying to get stuff for school but he kept putting it back. Steven sees them and walks over to them.

""Hi! What's your name? I'm Clarence! These are my friends Sumo and Jeff!""

""Hi, I'm Steven!""

""Hello, Steven,"" Jeff said, waving. Steven smiles at him.

""Hey, Steven! wanna get in with Clarence?"" Sumo asked. Steven looks at the boy in the red shopping cart, Steven smiles and gets into it with him.

""Ready guys!"" Sumo asked, gripping the handlebar of the cart.

""Yeah!"" Steven and Clarence both cheer. Sumo started running at full speed, both boys laughed as all three of them were having fun.

Rose, on the other hand, was picking School Supplies for Steven. Rose put some clothes in her cart. She was walking to get school supplies and some new clothes for him.

Rose looks up ahead, a boy races past her with two other boys in a shopping cart.

Steven laughed along with Clarence as they were having the time of their lives. Jeff ran behind them with some school supplies in his arms. ""Guys! Come on, where am I going to put these!""

""Put them in my shirt!"" Steven said, lifting his shirt, Jeff almost freaked out because of the gem in his navel.

Jeff tried not to cringe at that. But he was fascinated as well. The boy had to ask it. ""Doesn't that hurt, Steven?""

""No, I wasn't born without a belly button. So my mom took me to the jewelry store and we bought a Rose Quartz gem.""

""Uh, guys that's not a—""Jeff was cut off by Sumo. ""Aw come on man! Hey guys. Let's go get pizza!"" Sumo said, Steven and Clarence both cheer. Jeff sighed.

""What about Back To School shopping? My mom gave me her card.""

""You can do that! were going to get pizza!"" Steven yelled back, already running out the doors with his new friends and now walking to the Pizza Hut that was across the street.

Jeff walked into the Pizza Hut and opened the door, Target bags in his hands as he walked up to the counter with them. ""Guys! I have my mom's card!"" Jeff said. Steven was bouncing on his heels, Clarence did the same thing. All three of them ordered pizza, Jeff got cheese pizza. Steven got pizza with mushrooms.

""Hey, Steven. Why won't you get pepperoni?"" Clarence asked the boy.

""Oh, because I am vegetarian.""

""What's that?"" the boy asked.

""It means a person that doesn't eat meat, Clarence,"" Jeff said. Steven nods. he was right.

""Oh, so how long have you been a vegetarian for, Steven?"" Jeff asked.

""Since I was six,"" he said.

""How old are you now, Steven?"" Clarence asked the boy.

""I'm eight,"" he said Jeff nodded, concerned for Steven, but he brushed it off.

They all ate pizza and talked.

""So, Steven, have you lived in California your whole life?""

The boy looks at his pizza, his eyes dart back to Jeff. ""Um…. I moved here from Deleware… Something happened…"" Steven said, Jeff knew, he knew from the sound of his voice.

""Did…. Did you lose your house?"" Jeff asked sadly. Steven nodded. He put his elbows on the table and he covered his eyes with the palms of his hands. Jeff got up, sat next to him, and put a hand on his back.

Clarence and Sumo looked at each other in sadness for their new friend. Clarence ran up to him and hugged Steven, Steven shut his eyes and let it out. He's been holding this in since yesterday.

Steven, Clarence, Jeff, and Sumo all went back to Target, Steven saw his mother.

""Oh, you guys are back! how was it?"" Rose asked, getting starry-eyed.

""It was fun, Mom, Oh. These are my new friends, Clarence, Jeff, and Sumo."" Steven said.

""Oh, hi guys! Where are you going to school?""

""Oh, we're going to California Elementary School,"" Jeff said, Steven's eyes went starry and hugs them.

""Oh my gosh! we're going to be in the same school!"" Steven laughed with joy, he was so happy. He couldn't wait for tomorrow!

…

Rose opened the door to Steven's temporary bedroom, the boy was sleeping peacefully, and his head of curly hair was seen as he had his back turned to her, Rose smiled softly and whispered in his ear. ""Steven…""

Steven's eyes opened, and he sat up. ""Good morning, Steven… Time for school,"" she told her son gently. Steven got out of bed and stretched.

Steven went out into the hallway and the bathroom.

Dressed in a bright red T-shirt with a star on it, Steven was in Misty's car. It was seven in the morning. They had to get to the school by eight. Rose was basting rock music from her phone in the car, connected to an AUX cord.

Steven's eyes went starry as they entered the school, there were a lot of kids walking or getting dropped off by their parents.

Steven and Rose both see the entrance to a building named ""California Elementary School."" The building has a modern, minimalist architectural style with white walls and a flat roof.

The entrance is centrally located, featuring a pathway leading up to a gated entrance with glass doors. The name ""Whittier School"" is displayed above the entrance.

To the left is a large tree with a thick trunk and a broad canopy, providing shade to a section of the front yard. The front yard consists of a well-maintained lawn with some small shrubs and a few benches placed along the walls of the building.

To the right, a digital signboard is mounted on the wall, displaying school-related information. Additionally, there are a few posters or notices on the wall near the entrance.

In the foreground, there is a parking area with marked parking spaces and a blue curb, likely indicating a designated drop-off or handicap-accessible area. The sky above is clear with a few scattered clouds, it is a pleasant day. The overall scene is tidy and welcoming, typical of an educational institution.

Rose parked in the parking lot, turned off the car and they both went inside. Steven was holding Rose's hand as he had on a bright red backpack with a bunch of yellow stars on it that matched his shirt. Steven wore his pink flip-flops as they entered the building.

Elementary school-aged kids were walking around the halls. Cyan blue lockers lined the halls, Steven's eyes were starry again as he and his mother walked to the office a few feet by the front doors.

Steven and Rose both walk into the front office, it was big and spacious, Rose sees the secretary. The secretary looked up and removed her glasses. ""Oh, hello,"" she said.

""Hi, I called about enrollment for my son.""

The woman finds his file on her computer.

""Ah, here. Steven Quartz Universe. Correct?"" she asked, Steven nodded.

""I just want to let you know, that your son has a beautiful middle name.""

Steven blushed when he heard that.

""Thank you, I gave him that,"" Rose said, smiling at her.

""Alright, Steven you will be in Miss. Amin's class."" Steven smiles. ""Steven, do you want some help getting to your class?"" His mother asked.

""Yes, please,"" Steven said. Rose smiled and held his hand as mother and son both tried to find his classroom. Rose looks at the paper. Which shows his class Schedule and locker number.

""Okay, your locker number is twenty-two. And your class is…."" Rose paused as she kept walking, Steven looked at the hallway. Rose got to the door.

""Here it is!"" She said, then opened it. Steven's eyes went starry as he saw the classroom. ""Wooah, look, Steven!"" Rose smiles. Steven giggled and ran to a table.

This classroom has a well-organized and inviting appearance, designed to facilitate learning and engagement. Here are some key features:

The classroom contains several rectangular tables arranged in clusters, each with multiple chairs. This suggests a setup conducive to group work and collaborative learning.

Each table has name tags and worksheets or booklets, indicating assigned seating and prepared materials for the students.

The walls are decorated with bulletin boards, one of which has large, visible labels such as ""EVERY DAY COUNTS,"" suggesting an emphasis on daily activities or goals.

There is a large window at the back, allowing natural light to fill the room, creating a bright and welcoming environment.

Below the window, there are various potted plants, adding a touch of greenery and a natural element to the space.

Shelving units along the walls are filled with bins, books, and educational materials, providing easy access to resources.

There is a whiteboard or bulletin board at the front with additional materials pinned up, likely used for instructional purposes or displaying important information.

The tables have tennis balls on the legs, which likely serve to reduce noise and protect the floor.

The ceiling has exposed beams and fluorescent lighting, typical of many classrooms.

Overall, the classroom is thoughtfully arranged to support a dynamic and interactive learning environment, with ample resources and a focus on both individual and group activities.

Steven finds his seat with a name tag with the names 'Clarence, Jeff, and Ryan' on it. ""Mom, look! Clarence and Jeff are in my class! but… who's Ryan?"" Rose was confused by that too. ""I don't know, Steven. We have to see,"" she said then stood to her original height.

Rose and Steven both see the teacher enter the classroom with a coffee cup in her hand. Steven looks at her.

The woman is smiling and standing outside the door. She is wearing a white headscarf that covers her hair and neck. Her attire seems to be modest, with the headscarf being a prominent feature. And her expression is friendly and welcoming.

""Hello!"" Rose said, shaking the woman's hand. The woman shook her hand. ""Hello, I am Miss. Amin, you must be Steven."" she knelt to his level, putting both hands on her knees.

""Hi,"" Steven said, shaking her hand.

""Are you excited for your first day with us?"" Steven frowned and then looked at the floor. Miss. Amin darts her brown eyes back to his mother in concern.

""Oh, Steven had a bad experience at his last school. He got bullied a lot.""

""Oh, we make sure that won't happen,"" she said.

""Miss. Amin, where are you from?"" Steven asked. The teacher smiles. And tells him.

""I am from Palestine,"" she says. Steven's eyes went starry, he never heard of a teacher from that country before. He has a teacher who was from Africa, but that's it.""

""That's nice, I am from another planet,"" Rose said casually.

""Excuse me?"" she said, she thought she didn't hear right.

""I am from another planet."" Steven looks at her and nods.

""Okay, that's fine. you're not going to…. Probe or harvest my organs?"" she asked nervously.

Rose tried not to laugh then she cleared her throat. ""No."" Miss. Amin sighed in relief and then smiled. ""Well, Steven. We're happy to have you in my class. Sorry if this is personal. But, what race are you exactly?""

""We're a race called Gems,"" Rose said. Steven walked away to look at the stuff in her classroom.

""Okay."" the woman looks at her wedding ring.

""So you're married to another member of your species?""

""No, I'm married to a human. And Steven is half human, so he's a hybrid of a gem and human."" The teacher nods.

""Alright."" Then the bell rings, and kids start filing in. Clarence walked in and was wide-eyed.

""Steven!"" the boy said.

Steven turned around and ran up to him. ""Clarence!"" he hugs him.

""Guess that they're going to be good friends already. Steven! I have to go now, I'll see you later!"" Rose said. Steven hugs his mother.

""I love you mom."" Rose kissed him on the cheek.

""I love you too. Oh, I will not be picking you up. Tony or your father will be picking you up."" Steven nods.

""Can I hang out with Clarence after school Mom? please?""

""Are you familiar with California yet?"" Steven thought for a moment and sighed. ""No…. But I will be with Clarence and his friends! And I have a full battery!"" Steven said pulling out his phone and showing her that the green battery on his iPhone was fully charged and green.

""Alright, you can go with them, Steven. But if anything goes wrong, You call me or your dad, even the Crystal Gems right away. Aright?""

Steven nods and hugs her. ""Thank you, thank you, thank you!"" Rose giggled and kissed his cheek.

""Have a good day, Steven!"" Rose said, leaving the classroom.",0,1737176401.0,stevenuniverse,0,0.5,False

Appropriately named star bears coffee. 
She was 17had just graduated carrotinginton high school and was able to indulge in the one thing she loved coffee

She adored it the beans the smell the sound of theanual grinders . No electric ones for her no siree .
 To star coffee was an art form something she was made to do.

On this preticilar day starchad woken up at 5 am had a quick shower and headed down to start the coffee and hot cocoa machines for the day.
 
Starbears coffee was a quaint little shop just off the main station so she got plenty of customers and honestly that was the problem .
You see star loved making coffee loved serving small cups full of perfection but she didn't like customers always yapping and jabbering about things not having a chance to actually enjoy the coffee and cakes she spent so much time making.

Star sighed as she unlocked the door  waving to Stan the bus driver who would be over soon to fill his thermos . ""Hotcocoa bit of orange syrup but of caramel extra cream she whispered to herself as she set the machine to on with a whir and hissing of boiling liquids."" Star knew her regulars orders  like she knew her own paw.
 
She set out the fresh baked bread from the bakery down the road and hot cookies . The eating kind not the currency kind.. star thought to her self as she worked helping herself to a mint chocolate chip cookie
The hot dought matrix melted in her mouth the flavours of vanilla and brown sugar augmented the coolness of the mint perfectly.

""Oh yummy these are fantastic star said as she wiped crumbs from around her dainty muzzle. Her preparation all complete she turned her sign from closed to open poured herself another cup of cocoa and waited for the first guests of the day.

As usual she did t wait long and within an hour or so as the sun rose she went from a few regulars to passers by dropping in for a hot drink.
 The morning fog slowly boiled away with the winter sunlight in wisps. And star was polite while she served 

The shadows shortened in the window as the sun continued it's slow inexorable trek along the sky . Customers came and went until there was a break around noon

Star wars tidying up when cole came through the door looking a bit out of sorts . 
Normally star would t be too bothered about her customer personal lives but this was cold
Sweet kind gentle cold a bear who loves the trains he cared for like a mother would with a child.

Hi cole why do t you sit down and I'll bring you your drink over ....you look well haggard if you don't mind my saying so

Star mixed his drink expertly adding a foam train to the top on hopes of cheering him up.
 Order done she pulled out the next batch of cookies and brought over the plate . Something told her he needed a friend .

Thanks star said cole as he slipped his drink his usually shiny eyes  heavy .

So what's up you know she began not sure how to say it or start a conversation.  . I'm sorry cole I'm not that good at this but why don't you tell me what's wrong maybe speaking will help you.
She sat across from him her tidy green apron  clashing with his blue and white pinstripe overalls  . He nodded and began to cry

It's the haughly he said taking in great gulps of air she got hurt and she's poorly now  he cried

Stars brain thought fast ""is that one of the trains?"" 

Cole nodded  she broke some of her pipework. I feel so bad for her there's nothing i can doatt and Bruno are working on treating her. He continued clearly anthropomorphizing the train into a living creature. Star just nodded along refilling his cocoa as needed
 
After an hour or two of cole crying and explaining everything that was wrong. Most of which went over her head .. what on earth is a rocker box and linkage rod .

She had an idea hey cole . You say you feel bad cause you think haughlys all sad and lonely why not go sit with her and read to her I've heard it helps people feel better in hospital. She says brightly filling up a large thermos and boxing up some cookies and other cake for him
I'm sure she'll appreciate someone to keep her company she added placing the packages beside him.

Cole sniffled plew his nose on his hankerchief and stood that's a good idea stAr he said patting her on the shoulder as he took the package and left.

Through the rest of the day star noted something sometimes it seemed the ajiett ones who came in didn't want to be quiet the wanted to be heard so when she could shed approach and ask

Do you want  to talk about it.

According to my parents…. (i don’t agree with any of this, this is just what they say) 

taking the bus is unsafe because homeless people and other dangerous people use the bus

energy drinks like monster and bull are unsafe because someone died from drinking them without following the rules on the can. the rules on can say you can drink them if your 14 but they still unsafe for me even though im 14

coffee is also unsafe, also because someone died once from drinking too much 

instagram is unsafe because human trafficfers will find us on there and traffic us. 

deodorant is unsafe because it harms skin and we don’t need it because they think our race doesnt smell. i secretly bought unsented girls deodorant (i couldnt find unsented guys one) that I use that they dont know about because i have fear of smelling bad and smelling good is like only compliment most people say to me. 

cooking with raw meat is unsafe because we wont know how to cook it enough (even though we know how to cook everything else correctly) and we dont clean correctly so will containimate the kitchen

getting haircut by guy is unsafe because he is probably gay and could have disease and cut himself and infect us with his blood. my parents also say they supportive of gay people and don’t think thinking like this is anti gay. 

kids with mental conditions like austim are dangerous because they will assult us because they dont know its wrong so we shouldnt talk to them

if they are not home answering door is unsafe (unless its to answer for something they want) because if we answer they will know we are home alone and rob us or kidnap us. 

eating any food from india or food from indian restaurant is unsafe because the food there is made in unsanitary ways. we bought pickled jalapenos on instacart and my mom wouldnt let us eat them because they said product of india (which we didnt know when we bought them on instacart)

Beams of golden early morning light break through the cracks in the blinds, casting dappled light onto the carpeted floor. Particles of dust idly float in the bright light.

Mark sat on the edge of the bed, gently running his fingers over the wooden picture frame. Its once bright white color now giving way to a subtle, faded yellow. The frame’s wooden surface is marred by many scratches and chips, but the picture nested into the center of the frame is still as vibrant as ever.

The photo captured both Mark and his partner, Sally. They both stood on the shore of a sandy beach, the setting sun painting the sky with brilliant shades of pinks and oranges. Her flowing blonde hair cascaded down her back. Her bright blue eyes were practically glowing in the photo. They were both smiling, Mark’s gaze flicking back and forth between them. Mark couldn’t help but smile at the picture, also smiling at the memories they had created that day.

Mark slowly brought his head up, shifting his gaze from the framed photo to the bedroom door. He heard the familiar padding of bare feet across the hardwood floor. The handle on the door slowly turned before opening slightly with a barely audible creak. A familiar face peeked through the cracked door.

It was Sally.

She was wearing a smile on her face, with it reaching her eyes, making them crinkle at the corners. Those pearly white teeth of hers seemed to make the already bright room glow even brighter. Sally stepped into the room fully, closing the door behind her with a soft click.

“Hey,” she tucked a strand of blonde hair behind her ear. Sally looked between the picture frame and Mark’s smiling face.

“Feeling nostalgic this morning?” Sally asked with a playful lilt to her voice. She took a few small steps forward as she said this.

“I guess you could say that.” Mark planted his palms against the bed and pushed himself onto his feet, with both him and the mattress springs letting out a groan.

Mark slowly shuffled across the room, his bare feet brushing against the fluffy carpet. Sally stood there, watching Mark slowly move across the bedroom, her face still set with that warm smile.

“You look tired.”

As if on cue, Mark stretched languidly with a big yawn.

“A little,” he lied.

“Well…” Sally started, moving over to the nightstand where a mug of coffee was waiting, “would you like some—” The mug was empty, void of the dark brewed liquid.

“Coffee…” Sally giggled sheepishly, turning to face Mark. “I could make you a fresh mug if you want.”

Mark yawned again, this one shorter than the last. “Okay. I’d like that, Sally. Thank you.”

He made one final glance at the photo before placing it on the bed.

Sally smiled at Mark warmly. “Of course.”

Sally moved over to where Mark stood and lightly grasped his hand within her own.

“C’mon,” Sally said, that same playful quality to her voice. “Let’s make you that pot of coffee. Just how you like it.”

She gently pulled Mark towards the door, beaming with a gentle happiness.

Ingredients • 20g coffee beans (KINGgrinder K6 on setting 10) • 60g water (heat about 30 sec or until the first boiling bubble appears) • 100g milk • 10g maple syrup(or your favorite sweetener) Instructions 1. Prep the coffee Add ground coffee to the AeroPress and shake side-to-side to level it (no clumps). 2. Heat the water Microwave 60g of water for about 30 sec, just until the first boiling bubble appears. 3. Brew Place the AeroPress on your mug and pour in the hot water quickly. Swirl to saturate all the grounds. Insert the plunger and press with firm, steady pressure. It will take 10-20 sec (you’ll need to press pretty hard). Push past the “hiss” to get every last drop. 4. Prepare the milk Microwave 100g of milk for 30 sec (don’t let it boil). Warm your immersion blender in hot water, then froth the milk to your liking. 5.

I hear two very quiet footsteps go past my tent. It's gotta be my friend. 'He knows I've got stuff to do today. Probably bailed knowing we'll meet up later.' Smoke. Gear packed. Me out of tent. Gear out of tent. Tent lock on. Down the trail.

Gas station. Coffee. 'No flavored creamers?  What is this world coming to? 😁' Head towards library. A guy up a ways in front of me, ""Do you know where the social security office is?"" ""Yeah, it's on Government street."" He turns back around and keeps walking. I catch up to him as the coffee starts to put my brain in gear. ""Actually I walked by there the other day. Hit Government Street, take a right, it's on this side of the street."" We continue walking towards Government Street.

He starts telling me how the last thing he needs to do is get his award letter from social security. He's a vet, and is getting housing. ""I can't wait to get social security. Only fifteen more years!"" We both laugh. He goes on to tell me about how he's losing blood internally and the doctors at the V.A. can't figure out how. ""That place is a nightmare to deal with."" ""I don't recommend living there 'cause it's a nightmare on the streets, but California..."" He cuts me off, ""California? I'm from California. I got a sister here, a kid here, grew up here, another kid here..."" ""I'm from California too."" ""Oh yeah? What part?"" ""Ventura."" ""Oh nice. I know that area. Been all over there."" We chat about knowing each other's old stomping grounds.

Government Street. ""It's a block or two down if I remember correctly. Just keep going, you'll run right into it. He goes right. I start to cross the street. I hear a voice. ""What?"" He's turned around walking back my direction smiling. Gives me his name. I do a 180. Walk back to the sidewalk. Give him mine. We shake hands. He seems genuinely pleased we met. The feeling's mutual.

Cross the street. Library. Find a spot to sit and smoke. 'I'm doing this laundry TODAY!' Check maps. Twenty-seven minute walk, or six minute bus ride. Leave in a little over an hour for bus stop right across the street. 

I've got no issues walking twenty-seven minutes with this pack. My tent, tripod chair, umbrella, pad, and gallon of water are back at camp. I walked four to five miles with full gear  coming out of Tutwiler, Mississippi a couple weeks ago before taking a break. And I walked a little over twelve miles that day. Two hours of walking between breaks.

But I hauled everything I own out of camp, all over town, and back to camp yesterday. And then set it all back up before bed. My body hurts. I'm still a little worn from it. 'Six minute bus ride it is!' Into Library. Chargers out. Phones plugged in. Power cell plugged in. Reddit. Watching the time. My friend comes over.

""The van from -super sweet cold weather shelter- will be here at 5:30 to pick us up for a meal, snacks, and a shower."" ""Sweet! We'll be well fed, setup with healthy snacks during the rain tomorrow, and a shower."" ""Yeah!"" ""We are living the dream today! I'm gonna go do laundry. I'll be back in a bit."" ""Cool."" A little more reddit. Time to go. Bus stop. Finishing coffee. Having another smoke. 'Dude. Clean laundry AND a shower? That's gonna be so nice!'

""Hey you don't happen to have another dollar do you?"" A young black guy, who I can see is frantically trying to get something done on his phone. He's definitely not texting someone. The bus is two short streets away coming towards us. ""Yeah man."" Wallet out. ""Oh thank you so much!"" I hand him a dollar. ""Thank you man!"" ""No worries bro. We all gotta get where we're going."" ""I was trying to do it on the app but it wouldn't go through."" ""People have helped me. The least I can do is spread it around."" He nods with a kind look in his eye. Bus pulls up. He very respectfully steps back to let me on. Board bus. Find a seat in the back. He finds a spot a little bit in front of me. I'm looking at maps so I don't miss my stop. ""Thanks again!"" I look up. ""Any time.""

I doubt it was a actually even six minutes. Stop coming up. Pull cable. Bus stop. Off bus. Cross Street to laundromat. Inside. Drop gear. Go to window. ""Can I help you?"" ""Do you guys sell laundry soap?"" ""We do. It's cash only..."" Get rundown on how vending machines work. ""Thank you very much."" I've got four dollars in cash and a little bit of change on me.

I immediately fuck up and buy a box of stain lifter. 'Add to wash with detergent.' Check price on detergent. Just enough. And it's liquid tide with oxy-clean. Not my usual, but I wasn't expecting miracles. And that shit works! 

The machines will work on quarters or an app. I looked the place up yesterday. I'm pretty used to going down to the hood to do laundry 'cause it's cheap. This place has great reviews for the last five years. I'm not trying to waste time with travel because of that sweet sweet shower and dinner I'm dreaming of later. I check prices on machines, super reasonable.

Wifi password. App downloaded. The smallest amount I can transfer is $10.00. And they'll give me $2.00 if I do so. 'Even better!' You know my computer science degree having self is in love with doing laundry over a wifi network.

Bathroom. Every thing out of pockets. Strip down. Two layers of long johns off. Shorts. T-shirt I have on. Flip flops. Back out. 

Everything else I own that's washable into machine. Even my stinky shoes. Stain lifter. Three times the amount of detergent recommended. App out. Select machine. Money added to machine. Hit start. The app keeps track of how many minutes are left.

(I'm sure we've all done laundry before. No need to get into that.)

App controls dryers too. 'Isn't science wonderful.'

Laundry rolled. Into backpack. 'I knew this backpack was full when I left.' 😁 Back to library. Charging. Reddit. 

A very nice redditor/vagabond I've talked to quite a bit gets back to me on chat. Tells me she's going through some shit, not eating much 'cause flying a sign where she's stuck waiting out the cold is shit. No feeds. (I asked. She didn't bring it up first. I've lived in South Carolina, I know how they are sometimes.) People have been hooking me up, I shoot her some cash. We all gotta take care of each other out here.

My friend comes running over at 5:00. Points to the floor, ""The van is here!"" He takes off. I execute the fastest charger, cables, power pack disassembly I've ever done. Stuff in backpack. Double check I'm not leaving anything, and haul ass downstairs and out into the parking lot.

No van. Him, ""They were already gone when I got here."" ""Well that sucks. Shoot them another text."" He does. They say they'll come back and get us. We stand around until 6:15.

My friend who has a key to my boat and is keeping an eye on it shoots me a text. ""How do I turn your bilge pump on?"" It's not that he doesn't know how to turn a bilge pump on. He's on his seventh sailboat. My charge controller for my solar system is set to turn the boat power on from sunset to sunrise. My Masthead Light (aka my Anchor Light) is switched on. To turn the bilge pump on during the day you have to change the settings in my charge controller. Rarely are two controllers the same on different boats. I know he's never seen the one I have. I bought it when I started wiring in an electrical system.

For one boater to give another boater a key to his boat is pretty much unheard of. I trust this guy with my life. And literally have many times. He's done the same with me. We both live a life that can and will kill you if you don't keep your shit 100% together. There is no, ""I'm exhausted. I'll deal with that, or go see what that noise is, later."" We do it because it's the most awesome experience and way to live there is. We always help each other.

Always.

I give him the rundown in a way that's easy to read and follow. No reply. I don't expect one. He's got shit to do too.

My friend here however, is in 'fuck this' mode. Me too. The shelter van peeps have had way more than enough time to get there, drop everybody off, and come back and get us. Way more. Me, ""I'm gonna smoke another cigarette and then I'm going back to camp."" ""Sounds good."" Smoke. No van. We both look down the street where the van would come from. Still no van. ""Well, fuck this."" Grocery store. Munchies in case we're rained in tomorrow. I get him a pack of smokes. He tells me he'll get me back when his money comes in tomorrow. ""Don't worry about it.""

I don't help others because I want anything in return, or I know you can pay me back. I help others because it's the right thing to do and it makes me feel good. And I wouldn't be here telling you guys hitchhiker stories if many people hadn't helped me over the years. (And by the way, Thanks to all of you here! I appreciate the comments, what you've done for me, and just giving me some nice human contact.) I'm a little selective, but my only requirement is that you're not a piece of shit. 

Back to camp. We hang out a bit at our spot. Shoot the shit for a bit. Time for bed.

I'm currently sitting in my tent. It's just shy of sixty degrees. My tent window has been open for the last couple hours while I type this out. I'm munching on some gardettos. I've got half an Italian sub sandwich, some dried cranberries, a fresh pack of cheap smokes, and an almost full gallon of water. I know my friends are taken care of. The tarp's on my tent...

Life is good today for this hitchhiker!

Thank you guys for coming with me!!!

As I've moved back into my dorm and onto campus, life has hit me hard. I've been suddenly unable to access my anti depressants, the one year of my mother's death is approaching, my roommate is causing a lot of stress on my life, etc etc (typical college student stuff yk).

 For me, I haven't felt this depressed in a LONG time. I decided that I ""needed my home"" this first weekend back. I grabbed myself a coffee for the hour drive and turned on some music. Eventually, a worship song that I had saved into my favorites began playing. I instantly felt drawn towards it. I sang along and felt the strong urge to seek out other worship songs that I held deep in my heart. As I listened to them, I was overcame with tears. So much emotion. It was a release from the week I just had, I'm sure. But I feel like I felt God there. For the rest of the drive, I listened, sang, and cried.  As cringy as it may sound, it felt like a much needed hug and a warm light. I felt okay.

In short, I absolutely love all things coffee and espresso but I haven't crossed the bridge of learning the espresso machine, let alone even considering a budget of what this retails for (spoiler alert: it retails for just shy of $1200). However, I am not one to turn down an adventure of fixing something and especially if I don't have much invested. 

The former owner of it said he's had it for five years and only ever used distilled water in the machine and had a suspicion it could be a pump replacement is all it needs. It does power on, but none of the switches or buttons are currently working.

  
I guess my question is, if it is a pump issue, how much does a home espresso machine pump replacement cost, and how much can you expect a repair shop (the former owner recommended an espresso repair shop in the neighborhood) to charge for the labor?

Are there other common espresso machine issues I should be on the lookout for?

I am sleeping great with Trazedone, but I had pretty bad side effects after taking my first 30 mg capsule of duloxetine. I felt dizzy and drunk for several hours and then had a headache.

My concern was that I might have been experiencing serotonin syndrome after combining Trazodone and Duloxetine. Additionally, I had my usual two mugs of coffee. I am wondering if I should try a low dose, like 20 mg daily or 20 mg every other day or just live with nerve pain and not take Duloxetine at all? If I continue taking Doloxetine, I suppose I can never have caffeinated drinks or an occasional glass of wine or cocktail again? This is a difficult decision based on my limited experience.

The reason I was prescribed Duloxetine is that I was having severe dry mouth from taking Doxepin (for insomnia), Escitalopram (for anxiety), Bupropion (for ADHD and depression) and Gabapentin (for polyneuropathy). So I can’t go back to that.

Kinda given up on finding that enduring, lasting kinda love. Because of my willingness to believe that people are who they say they are, and that they're as honest as me, I've made string of bad choices when it comes to men and relationships. 
In a fit of boredom recently, I signed up to a local dating app. I got a few standard and boring messages, most of which I either didn't reply to, or politely said thanks but no thanks. Couple of conversations but nothing that actually really sparked any interest in me.. 
Until.. I got a message from 55M. His message immediately caught my interest, showing humor and that he'd read my profile. 
We chatted for a few days on the app, and then I offered to swap numbers, not something I'd normally do but he really did pique my interest. 
We've subsequently met for coffee one afternoon before work, and it went great! Same easy conversation and banter in real life, sharing lots of commonalities, including a reluctance to introduce anyone to our families as we have grand children (who're about the same age) and don't want to see them hurt. Him because his most recent ex (not the kids grandmother, but had always been Nana to them) had suddenly dipped out of the kids lives with no warning to them, even though he would have not had a problem with her spending time with them,  me because my children's father is going through a separation with his new wife and we're not sure if she'll be around for our g-babies anymore. Just don't want to see them hurt. 
We continued to chat via text and call, and went out for dinner and Thursday night. Once again, we both had a great time, so much laughter! But lots of deep convo too.. he's smart, funny, blokey, loves to cook, loves his grandbabies, dogs and the beach.  All things I find extremely important. 

It's now Saturday, he's out of the blue invited me out to the beach he's at for the weekend with his friends. Nothing seems dodgy about it, I'd go in my own car as he's already there. Looks like a stunning spot too. It's an hour and a half away though, no biggie, except I'd have to spend the night.. which he knows.. I can't do night driving. 
It's a lot, and I kinda freaked a little. I'm really tired and don't know that I'm ready to spend the night after only 2 irl encounters. 
I like him, and could see myself potentially spending a lot of time with him.. but not just yet ya know. 
Now I'm second guessing myself in every way imaginable.. is he asking cos he's not really who I think he is, and he's just after a hook up? Is he asking as a way to get me in a position where I can't say no or can't leave? Is he asking cos he's really into me and just wants to hang out? 
I said thanks but no thanks, legitimately because I'm just exhausted. Now I'm freaking out that he's got the pips with me cos I said no, on the basis of nothing at all by the way. 
So, much as I like him, is it really worth putting myself through all of this? 100% of intimate relationships I've had with men have been a bust, and I've always been left to claw my way back to a healthy place emotionally. 
Do I want to bother with the over thinking and the uncertainty for it to turn out to be nothing but heartbreak for me again..? cos based on results, that's what will happen. 
How come adulting is so hard? 
Gah. If anybody wants to share similar situations in their lives and how it turned out for them, please do.  I'd like to think that we will continue to chat but I dunno 🤷‍♀️",4,1737174080.0,datingoverforty,9,0.7,False

I often find it strange and inaccurate when people complain about Juliet being so upset when she finds out that Shawn is lying about being Psychic. I've heard so many people say that it's bad writing and out of character, because there's no way such a smart detective would have believed he was truly Psychic. 

I find this really weird, because I feel like we must have been watching completely different shows... I seemed to recall it being very clear throughout the series that Juliet is well-established as a character who believes in Psychics. 

Well, during my current re-watch, I took it upon myself to write down all of the moments I noticed where the writers intentionally show us that she not only believes in the possibility of Psychics/the supernatural, but she definitely believes that Shawn is really Psychic and completely supports his abilities. 

I was planning to record these moments throughout my whole rewatch, but honestly, I'm getting kind of tired of doing it, so I decided to stop. But just in the first 9 episodes alone, here's what I noticed: 

\---

**S1E2 - Spellingg Bee**

Lassie: \*reacting to Shawn's vision\* This is ridiculous.

Jules: Is it? 

\* In this episode, she runs the Chinese food through the lab because Shawn seemed so sure, which was quite a risk for her job, given that she was new to the department and her superior definitely didn't support or authorize that decision. 

  
**S1E3 - Speak Now or Forever Hold Your Piece**

Juliet lets Shawn read her palm, and though she pretends to play it cool, it's obvious that she really believes what he's telling her in his reading. 

  
**S1E5 - 9 Lives**

When Shawn is having a vision at the first crime scene, Juliet seems very eager to see his vision. This shows that she obviously really believes that he's psychic. She's not watching him with the eye of a skeptic, like Lassiter. She is eager to see what happens because she believes he's really having a vision that will be helpful for their case. 

At the second crime scene, when Shawn correctly guesses Lassiter's coffee order, Jules is very excited and impressed by that. 

  
**S1E7 - Who You Gonna Call?** 

Shawn: I've been sent here by the Spirit of Pete Rose.

Lassie: Pete Rose isn't dead.

Jules: There was a picture of Pete Rose on the desk! (She says this excitedly, like she is impressed by Shawn's vision being correct.)

  
**S1E9 - Forget Me Not**

When Shawn is talking to Mike's picture, Juliet obviously believes he is really speaking to the missing man through his picture. She asks Shawn, in complete sincerity (not sarcastically or skeptically), ""what about \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (I can't remember the specific question). Did Mike say anything about that?""

\---

So, long story short, I just don't understand how anyone can say that it's out of character for Juliet to have believed Shawn was really Psychic. She literally believes it right from the very start, and we continuously see evidence of her belief, over and over. These are just a few examples, only from the first season alone. There are others too, as well as other evidence that Juliet is open to things of this nature (like her reading her horoscope in a future episode, when Shawn wore the Apple Jacks T-shirt). 

Maybe you think it's weird that someone would believe in psychics, but it is well-established as part of her character, so you can't really claim that it's bad writing or out of character for her to be a believer. ",22,1737174045.0,psych,5,0.93,False

Anyhow, I've never had anything really creepy or strange happen, and that's saying alot because I'm pretty non-chalant about being out here alone, or even when i was with my young daughter, never had any feelings of fear or anything really. 

Well, first time for everything I suppose! So it's like 430 am, 19° outside and I'm smoking a cigarette and having my coffee in the driver's seat just chilling in my parking spot at a mall that has a cabelas, but I'm kinda off to the outskirt side where truckers and stuff go to turn around, but there were no truckers, just me. 

I see a dark figure, like a dude with a trench coat and hoodie, doing some kind of (for lack of better words) ""ape dance?"" type stroll, arms flailing, thru the middle of the parking lot! He's coming my direction, yet not, he proceeds to dance around like this to the other side of the building and away from me after about 10 minutes. I'm thinking ok, well, I'll keep an eye out for that one! 

I carry on, go to the back and do whatever for a few. It's now about 515 and I decide to warm up the rig to get ready to move to a different spot i like to go to in the early morning time.  

So I'm waiting there, engine running for about 5 minutes, i smoked the rest of my cigarette and just by chance happen to catch my hair on something and I look over my shoulder, sort of behind my rig. (That little spot your side mirror just misses) And like a t-rex i see movement out there! I whip my body around to see that dude in the trench coat like 50 yards out from my drivers door and he's doing that freaky ""ape dance"" but he's coming straight for me! It was still dark out with a few distant lights and I swear we locked eyes for a flash! I literally said  ""Oh fuck this!"" out loud to myself, threw it in drive, and just went flying out of there, I scraped the shit out of my bike rack on the back because of the slope but I didn't care! I thought to myself that MF better not jump on cuz i ain't stopping and the freeway is right there! 

I have never had anything so wild happen before! 

On further investigation: I've now been able to go by that area, I really liked that spot, but found out there's a little ""shanty"" like structure tucked in there, so I must have been in that guy's yard and he didn't like it!?! Lol

A bit of fricking traffic at the end brought down my avg speed a bit, but that doesn't matter. 

Rediscovered my joy and my motivation to buy a Road bike sooner than later.

I’ve given up coffee because it would trigger hypomanic and manic episodes if I drank too much. I’m too scared to drink decaf in case I get this placebo effect where I think I’m caffeinated. But I miss the routine in the morning and the taste and using my cute coffee mugs. ,19,1737173665.0,bipolar,36,1.0,False

I also loved sitting on a bench and writing at the local park with a cup of coffee and a biscuit that I'd purchased from the local cafe.

I’m on meds and they do the job but I still have a hard time staying consistent with working out or just routine in general. Any suggestions for this. I just got into being able to take my meds consistently which involves it being right next to my bed but after that I get my coffee and my day just does what it does. ,1,1737173625.0,ADHD,3,1.0,False
