Hello fellow Puerto Morelos residents! Today's forecast brings a mix of sun and rain to our beautiful town. Starting off the day with a clear sky and temperature around 26¬∞C, it's the perfect opportunity to hit the beach or enjoy a morning walk along the shore. 

However, as we move into the afternoon around 5:00 PM, light rain showers are expected to make an appearance. So, if you're planning any outdoor activities, don't forget your umbrella or raincoat! The temperature will drop slightly to around 24¬∞C, making it a bit cooler and more comfortable for a nice cup of coffee at a local caf√©. 

By the evening, the rain should ease up, but the skies will remain cloudy with a temperature of 22¬∞C. It might be a good idea to have a cozy movie night in or head to a local restaurant for some delicious comfort food. Stay dry and enjoy the day, no matter what the weather brings! ‚òîüå¥üåßÔ∏è",1,1733047213.0,PuertoMorelos,0,1.0,False

My supervisor at work is a Leo just like me but I don't understand her at all. I think she is overly dramatic, bossy, rude, condescending and very self centered. She also talks way too much and for a really long time so in the end it gets really annoying listening to her talk about random stuff. I just think she is overly chit chatty and I can't stand people like that lol. Is like our personalities are completely different. I'm a Leo too but i'm not like her at all I'm more introverted and quiet which most people would not associate a Leo with. I don't like chit chatting because I think that's a waste of time and especially when we have a coffee break she sits there talking so much bs I can't stand that. I think it's fake and not real lol. I prefer being alone and she doesn't seem to understand that. I don't like having small talks with everyone like her I just thinks it's a waste of time. If I have something important to say then I will say it but I will not go on and start having a small talk about everything under the sun.

1h3zxbw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Water_Fasting/comments/1h3zxbw/completed_48hour_water_fast_part_of_a_5day/,Completed 48-Hour Water Fast (Part of a 5-Day Fasting Journey),"I‚Äôve just completed a 48-hour water fast, which is part of a 5-day fasting journey: 3 days of dry fasting followed by 2 days of water fasting. This has been an incredible experience for me, and I wanted to share a bit about my journey and insights with this amazing community.

A Note on Dry Fasting:
I would not recommend dry fasting unless you‚Äôre fully informed and confident in your health. There‚Äôs limited research on its long-term effects outside of religious practices like Ramadan (and even then, water intake is allowed at specific times). Please approach it with caution and always prioritize safety.

Breaking My Fast:
I broke my fast with a simple meal: a banana, a boiled egg, and a dark chocolate drink. Keeping it light and nutrient-rich felt like the right choice to ease my body back into eating.

My Fasting Highlights:
The longest fast I‚Äôve ever completed was 14 days‚Äî7 days of pure water fasting followed by another 7 days supplemented with sodium, potassium, magnesium, black coffee, and green tea. Each fast teaches me something new, and this one was no exception.

Key Takeaways:
	1.	Post-Fast Eating: Transitioning back to food is just as important as the fast itself. I‚Äôve learned that a low-carb diet post-fast helps maintain the benefits. Whole wheat bread, for instance, is filling and avoids insulin spikes.
	2.	Seasonal Fasting Goals: Fasting during the holiday season can be challenging but rewarding. Whether your goal is mental clarity, physical rejuvenation, or spiritual growth, the effort is worth it.

Wishing You Success!
To everyone fasting this Christmas season, I wish you good luck and great results. Remember, fasting is as much about discipline and self-discovery as it is about physical health. Stay strong and listen to your body!

Let me know how your fasting journey is going‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to hear about your experiences and insights!",1,1733046419.0,Water_Fasting,0,1.0,False

No job, no money, no friends, no boyfriend, no business success, no way out of misery. Keeping a positive attitude gave me nothing. ","I‚Äôm 24 years old, a university student. (Where I live you don‚Äôt go to college at 18). 

I‚Äôve been having many struggles in the last 5,6,7 years. 

1. *No job this year.* I couldn‚Äôt find a job that would fit with my college schedule, when you study 4 mornings and noons in the week, most places want you to work during mornings. 

2. *No friends and no extended family.* I only have my mother and sister as friends but that‚Äôs no enough. I don‚Äôt have grandma, uncle, cousin, someone who you can enjoy life with, go on road trips and meet in the weekends. I‚Äôm trying to understand why in every setting- high school, military, college, not a single person wanted to be my friend. I tried to be helpful, positive and kind. I‚Äôm a person and listens intently and doesn‚Äôt try to one up or be conceited. I showed new people around, I gave students compliments in front of the professor, I payed for someone‚Äôs printing. Nobody returned any favor so I stopped.

3. *I keep being defamed and attacked no matter what I do.* Girls were fighting with me over seats, these fools wanted me to give up my seat for them (1 example). And people befriended them! These evil and aggressive mean girls!!!! I heard people gossiping about me, with things that are not true. A group of people harassing me and attacking me happened to me dozens of times in life. Superiors did nothing. I defended myself and showed confidence but it didn‚Äôt help. It‚Äôs painful.

4. *Bad reputation.* No one even asked me ‚Äúis it true?‚Äù. It‚Äôs like people believe lies so easily. And then you get painted the villain and no one wants to come close to you so your bad reputation won‚Äôt stick to them.

5. *No money.* My mom is a single mom, we live in poverty, our kitchen is broken, our shower is fucked up, I can‚Äôt afford to go out a lot. Even a restaurant is expensive so I have to stay inside most of the time which causes boredom. 

6. *No man is interested is me.* Not a single man ever tried to hit on me (I‚Äôm a woman). No one came to me and said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go get coffee sometime?‚Äù Something so simple and small, that every 17 year old dude in a Netflix movie does. I‚Äôm 24 and never been in a relationship. 

7. *My business failed.* I even tried to start a business but over 6 months of marketing on instagram I didn‚Äôt even get one client.  I studied marketing in a course, I read marketing books, I got marketing consulting from an expert and yet nothing worked. 

8. *No academic success.* I worked my ass off on projects and things for college, I was so sure I‚Äôd score 90+. But many professors undervalue me. I got the lowest grades of my degree so far with 70,80, 79 etc which aren‚Äôt that awful but are the lowest amongst class.  

I even posted a question yesterday about a dude I had crush on but got engaged to someone else despite showing interest in me. It‚Äôs a little sad how he never even tried to get to know me. 

I don‚Äôt know how to change my life. I tried many things but nothing  is working.

1h3zk3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/thesopranos/comments/1h3zk3y/deanne_pontecorvos_brother_kills_tony_soprano/,Deanne Pontecorvo's brother kills Tony Soprano,"AJ is killed too because this is revenge for Eugene and Robbie Pontecorvo. That's why we don't see the hit. The Sopranos is about a gang of ruthless sociopaths. Many of them serial killers. They kill women and leave children fatherless but the climax is even more brutal.

  
We know that Patsy has the motive and the opportunity. Now all he needs is a hitman. Not the black guys Danny hired to kill Tony outside his therapist's office but an accomplice who will wait patiently for the opportunity to exact revenge. This is Deanne. She even told Eugene to put a bullet in Tony's head.

Look at what happens to Vito Jr. when his father is outed as a homosexual and murdered. Tony doesn't respect the oath he made to Chris and Eugene that their families will be provided for should something happen.

When Hesh, Janice and Vito are in the hospital after Tony gets shot they're talking about Eugene's suicide and Robbie's drug problem but there's no sympathy for this other family in their ""family"" who just lost their father. No one is bringing Deanne coffee and bundles of cash or a little stereo for the room.

The Members Only jacket points to Deanne and a male accomplice. The reason I think it's her brother is the show uses a lot of foreshadowing and a clue is Vic the wallpaper man paying for his nephew's college after Davey loses the sporting goods store. Vic's wife died and they had no children so if Tony's assassin is based on him then he has a strong motive to avenge his nephew. This is a reach but Deanne had the motive and Patsy would have known this when he went looking for a hitman.

Remember we know Patsy planned the hit because he's the only one who had Tony's location. But it would have been months of planning. It wouldn't be a New York guy or a paid hitman that might change sides at the last minute Patsy needed someone who wanted revenge as much as he did so the Members Only jacket points at Deanne.

First 2 months 36mg. And now a little over a month 54mg. 

I feel i did not understand adhd quite well when i was diagnosed at 16. So i didnt pay any attention to all my poasible symptoms and how the meds affect me. I think i did notice increase in focus.

I think currently im in a situation where ive researched a ton and learned so much and at the same time ive become hyper aware of my symptoms. I feel like things make more sense and my anxiety has become much easier to handle. In general things are going quite well in my life again. I quit drinking over a month ago, i live a happy life with my amazing girlfriend who shows interest in my condition and is very understanding.

One thing ive been thinking about a lot is how the euphoric/speedy effects have now disappeared almost completely. I know its supposed to be ""subtle"". 20-45min after i take my meds in the morning i do feel this sense of clarity, focus, calm and a slight ""kick"". Depending on how ive drank water, eaten and how much i drink coffee the kind of good feeling or kick remains for 4-6hours. I feel its much stronger because i have a habit of drinking A LOT of coffee. During work days i might drink 4-5 which i think in turn makes me chatty, scatter brained and a little hyper. I still feel clearer in my head, and i remain sort of calm but energetic. Also way better at organizing.

I was diagnosed with ADD but i was hyperactive as a child. Now that my depression has relieved along with anxiety i feel like im myself again and ive started to notice hyperactive symtpoms off meds i had when i was a kid. Overaharing, impulsive and sometimes very restless.

On meds i feel a lot more analytical as well due to being able to focus i my thoughts. I can get into hyperfocus mode easier. Ive noticed some aspie symptoms aswell which makes me wonder if theres something else going on aswell.

So I went finer

At grind 3 external: 25g coffee in 20 seconds and stops pouring.

We have a wood burning brick fireplace with no glass front, i.e. it's just open with an aftermarket metal screen in front. We enjoy having fires in the evening, but then of course have to go to bed. Lately we have stopped putting new logs on the fire 2-3 hours before bed, then we come down and break up the coals to cool it off faster right before going to sleep. We had been leaving the flue open all night, despite how much cold air came into the living room. 

However one day I came down in the morning to find a fine sprinkling of ash all over the hearth, living room floor, and coffee table in front of the fireplace. I can only assume that a strong downdraft blew ashes into the room? This makes us un-inclined to leave the flue open all night, but of course then we get smoke in the house if we close it, even 3-6 hours after letting the fire die down.

Is there an alternative solution? Getting glass doors isn't an option I don't think, since there's no alternative air draw for the chimney, and we probably can't afford them right now anyway. I can't think of any non-flammable covering to prevent ashes from blowing into the room. Or, are we just not able to have PM fires?",1,1733044116.0,Fireplaces,0,1.0,False

I see this as deception and probably fraud.A self excluded person could enter for an hour and spend $1000 and then security will come and say sorry you mist leave you have done self-exclusion, plus we will keep your money.I wanted the duty manager to clarify to me why such things are not enforced the moment you scan your ID.

I used to be a lover of red bull. I've always had a bit of caffeine on and off but a few years ago when I started working more my usage increased. 

I would usually only have one caffeinated beverage a day whether that be red bull, coffee, tea, or a coke. Red bull was my favorite but never more than once a day and not every day either. 

Over months I started having some increasingly strong chest pains, palpitations, and crazy anxiety out of nowhere that worsened when I had caffeine. My family has a history with heart disease so I decided to take my body's signs seriously. I experimented with going without caffeine several times and determined the caffeine was causing it. So I stopped completely.  

I always heard that it happened to people who had way too many energy drinks and combined a few a day, I thought I was safe limiting myself to one. Guess not. 

I'm afraid to drink red bull ever again because of the stories I've heard and how I've experienced the beginning symptoms myself. I miss it and I miss having some caffeine to get me through my last few hours of work or a rough morning. Now all I get from it is a panic attack and a health scare. Blegh.

I've lost about 4 pounds so far and definitely feel like i have a lot more energy than I previously did. My first few days on it I rearranged my entire room (furniture moving included) , got a decent amount of yard work i've been putting off done and  just have generally been able to keep the house cleaner which is super nice! 

  
I'm really having trouble with food though. I usually take mine with a bit of overnight oatmeal or some eggs. I find taking it with a protien has helped a lot with reducing the jittery side effects!    I no longer feel the desire to drink copious amounts of coffee  throughout the day which, yunno is nice for slowly kicking my caffiene addiction. and sweets are no longer interesting to me either which im thrilled about

  
The trouble is that after that initial meal, the nausea and upset stomach feelings start to kick in and last more or less until i go to sleep. The first few days using it I just wasn't hungry after an initial meal but i could still easily have a nice dinner with my partner without much issue (granted I ate less but i mean, that's a good thing haha)   Lately though even the thought of food is almost offputting to an offensive degree.  Nothing looks good or interesting and the idea of eating just makes me feel sick. 

I've done things like start taking out leftovers only to give up and put them back mid-microwaving.  My partner made a lovely fish dinner the other day, my half is still in the refrigerator because i just cannot bring myself to want to eat it and i feel horrible about that.  I spent forever the day before thanksgiving making a pavlova for everyone, i only had a tiny slice and even looking at the leftovers makes me feel like i want to throw up.  

I've managed to eat some plain rice white rice with turkey for dinner yesterday and tonight as it was the most inoffensive thing i could make myself think of and like, i have no trouble keeping food down. I just really REALLY struggle to find the motivation to eat in general  without feeling horrid. Every now and again i have a craving for a protien but the second i try to think about what to eat it's like my body immediately shuts down the suggestion. 

  
on one hand, i'm finally getting that calorie deficit i used to struggle with so badly, but on the other hand i know this isn't the healthy way to do things and im just wondering if anyone has any advice on how to deal with this.

My ex and I are very logical people, and we both don't tend to burn bridges.

So for context we're both Christians, he's a neurotypical straight white male, and I am a asexual ethnic female. So I feel I shouldn't have to explain the sociology and history behind the groups. After I've gone off my meds for mental health, we apparently broke up? I still talk to his relatives from time to time, so I had my confirmations when I talked to one of his relatives to find out we did break up. Which I was okay with, and he seemed okay with because he can focus on his busy work.

One instance after not taking meds anymore is when I visited him and we had a very serious conversation, like marrying, getting off meds, and being a power couple or something. I honestly should have journaled. but essentially I remember asking him being my friend, because I needed it. (and that boyfriend literally has 'friend' in the word but we'll put that aside).

A couple weeks later I called him because I was really looking forward to this movie coming out and I wanted to see it with him. At the time my mental health was deteriorating and objectively my life was falling apart. It was confirmed we broke up so I thought we could see something as friends. And of course being me, I didn't let him know that I was falling apart, I just informed him I wasn't very happy lately and this movie would make me happy, but he said he had a work trip to go to. plus the ""withdrawals"" from the meds were compared to coffee. Which made me go ""ok."" also something about self-pity or something. I don't really remember.

On a sidenote, I went to the movies by myself and the movie was AWESOME.

Anyways, We don't talk anymore, more so I'm making a comeback with the basics like eating and cleaning my room, and he's too busy with work. So we're both pre-occupied. The only time we do see each other is during church meetings. I had lots of time to think, and I doubt my future would be with him, albeit a small possibility. Like him saying some alarming stuff to me, but for the sake of biases I won't state them here. Or me appearently ghosting him at times, which I do think is my fault in retrospect.

Hey everyone, this is my first post on Reddit, and honestly, I‚Äôve never been the kind of person to believe in ghosts or supernatural things. But after what happened that night, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be the same.

I live in Pune, a bustling city in India, where life doesn‚Äôt stop no matter the hour. It was a cold winter evening, and I was at my desk, sipping coffee, lost in my own world. My mom called out and asked me to get some medicine for her. Being the procrastinator that I am, I pushed it off, saying I‚Äôd go later.

Time flew by, and soon it was 11 PM. The streets were quiet, with the kind of eerie calm that only comes late at night. I grabbed my jacket, my bike keys, and headed out to the 24/7 medical store nearby. After picking up the medicine, I felt the urge to go for a late-night ride‚Äîsomething I often do to clear my head.

There‚Äôs a small bridge not too far from my place, surrounded by towering trees and shadowed by tall buildings in the distance. The bridge has a kind of haunting beauty to it, especially at night. Beneath it runs a dam, and when it‚Äôs open, the rushing water creates a mesmerizing, soothing symphony.

Here‚Äôs where things get unsettling: in India, we don‚Äôt bury the dead‚Äîwe cremate them. And this bridge? It has four cremation sites around it‚Äîtwo at either end of the bridge. I didn‚Äôt think much of it. I‚Äôm not superstitious, and honestly, I never believed in ghosts.

It was midnight when I arrived. I parked my bike near the start of the bridge, lit a cigarette, and put on some music. The cold breeze whispered through the trees, and the distant sound of water made the setting almost surreal.

At the far end of the bridge, I noticed a pyre burning‚Äîa body being cremated. I decided to stay where I was and not disturb the rituals. An hour passed, and I felt it was time to head home. But to do that, I‚Äôd have to pass the cremation site.

I started my bike and began riding slowly. The closer I got, the more aware I became of the burning pyre. And then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it‚Äîa shadow.

At first, I thought it was a trick of the light. But as I got closer, the shadow became clearer‚Äîa man, squatting right next to the burning pyre.

I slowed down to get a better look, and what I saw still haunts me to this day. He was scratching his head‚Äîviolently, almost like he was trying to tear his scalp off. His movements were frantic, jerky, and unnatural. His hair was catching fire from the pyre, but he didn‚Äôt seem to care. Instead, he rocked back and forth, making these guttural, animalistic sounds.

My heart froze. Every instinct screamed at me to leave, but my body wouldn‚Äôt move.

Then, he turned.

In a flash, faster than anything I‚Äôve ever seen, he snapped his head toward me. I‚Äôll never forget the sound‚Äîa sharp, crackling zap, like static electricity. His face was illuminated by the flames, and his eyes‚Ä¶ his eyes were hollow, empty pits that seemed to swallow the light around them.

I don‚Äôt know how, but I managed to kill my headlights and twist the throttle, desperate to get away without drawing his attention. But as I passed him, I felt it‚Äîa cold, piercing gaze, as if he was looking straight into my soul.

I didn‚Äôt dare look back. My hands trembled, my body was drenched in sweat despite the cold, and I rode faster than I ever have, praying he wouldn‚Äôt follow.

When I reached home, I locked every door and window, my heart still pounding in my chest. That night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. The next morning, I woke up with a high fever that lasted two days.

When I finally gathered the courage to visit the bridge in daylight, there was nothing. No signs of anyone, no evidence of what I‚Äôd seen. To this day, I don‚Äôt know if it was a ghost, a hallucination, or something else entirely.

Yesterday, I went on a date with this guy. Handsome, funny, kind of perfect. He held the door for me, made me laugh till my sides hurt, and, I kid you not, the way he smiled? Total heart-melter.  

Here‚Äôs the kicker though: we‚Äôve been married for 2+ years. YEARS. But last night? It felt like I was meeting him for the first time all over again.  

There I was, sipping my coffee, trying to play it cool, but internally I was screaming, ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, who let you marry this snack?!‚Äù Every smile, every little thing he said‚Äîugh, I was melting.

Is this normal? Do I send him a cheesy love letter at this point or just awkwardly stare at him from across the room until he notices? I swear, marriage is wild. You think you know someone, and then BAM, you‚Äôre falling for them all over again.

Anyway, just wanted to share my little love spiral. If you need me, I‚Äôll be here daydreaming about him like a middle schooler with a crush.  ",4,1733043056.0,self,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been sitting with this for a while and need to vent. 

I am 23F & This is about a close friend (23F again) I‚Äôve known for three years in Mumbai. 

We started as colleagues in the same company then really close as we were from the same college, sharing everything, talking regularly, and genuinely supporting each other (or so I thought). But now, since I moved to another city, I feel like I‚Äôve been taken for granted, and it‚Äôs weighing heavily on me. We had been in touch over calls regularly talking every week staying connected, surprising each other on birthdays, etc. 

Okay so..

So here‚Äôs what happened, I was crossing their city as a part of a family trip I told them a day in advance that we‚Äôd be arriving around the evening certain time. I even bought them a small gift from my hometown because I genuinely wanted to make it special. But guess what? They didn‚Äôt bother replying to my message until 28 hours later. And when they finally did, it was something like, ‚ÄúOh, you mean Saturday, right?‚Äù Nope, I had very clearly mentioned it was Friday in my message.

Meanwhile, they were active on Instagram the whole time, posting stories with other friends. It‚Äôs not like they were too busy to see my message- they‚Äôre on their phone constantly.

This wasn‚Äôt a one-off either. During a huge milestone in my life, where I was coordinating the event and was getting an award professionally I worked so hard for-they showed up late, despite my reminding them multiple times. Later, I found out they‚Äôd scheduled a date with someone right before the show, like a coffee meet-up situation, and showed up late deliberately.

I‚Äôve tried to let things slide because I care about this friendship. Even recently, when they were feeling down, I consoled them over texts. But when I needed them to just be present, they couldn‚Äôt even reply in time, let alone make an effort. 

**Note:** *I do understand I'm not entitled to anyone's time and they can chose how to when to respond? but are we forgetting courtesy? basic courtesy? if you can't make it say you can make it , please it helps!*

What‚Äôs really bothering me right now is that they‚Äôve started sending guilt-driven messages like, ‚ÄúI miss your voice,‚Äù or suggesting a trip together. It all comes across as empty, as if they‚Äôre trying to soothe their own conscience rather than genuinely wanting to reconnect. If you miss me, why can‚Äôt you respond to my messages promptly? Why do you prioritize everyone else but me?

After three years of being close friends, I‚Äôve laid everything bare‚Äîthere‚Äôs no mystery left about who I am. Yet, they treat me as if I‚Äôm unpredictable or less important. This imbalance in our relationship is unacceptable. I refuse to confront them because that would give undue importance to someone who clearly doesn‚Äôt value me the same way.

I cared deeply for this friend and looked forward to seeing them, but I can no longer trust this connection. It feels superficial and one-sided. If they can‚Äôt prioritize my visit to their city, then there‚Äôs no point in pretending there‚Äôs any depth to this friendship.

I‚Äôm done. I won‚Äôt respond to their recent messages, and it‚Äôs not a game on my part; I‚Äôm simply tired of being the only one who cares. 

**Have you experienced something similar?** How do you let go of a friendship when you‚Äôve invested so much, but their actions do not match their words? I would appreciate your views.

I(21,Hindu) had an girl best friend( 21,Muslim) for 5 years. We were like the mirror image of each other. We stood up for each other during our ups and downs. After both of us suffered a break up last year and after a big misunderstanding of ours got resolved we came closer than ever. Some months later I developed a soft corner for her and I suspected the same for her but I brushed it off bcz I didn't find it okay as it would seem like I am treating her as a back up. And I was still not recovered from my break up and the trauma I got from that. 
So after time went on we became more closer to each other. In May we went out to our nearby town-like area, she bought a shirt as a birthday gift. We went to a few malls and then ate at a wow momo restaurant in the evening, returned to her home holding hands for the first time, then aunty gave me a cup of coffee and then I returned to my home at 10:00 pm. 

After my semester got over in July, we again went to our town area restaurant with another friend but we returned home just the two of us. Same things.... holding hands, resting her head on my shoulder and just for a brief moment I carried her like a princess to her home, then chatter for an hour there and returned home. 

And of course we used to send each other couple pins ( I didn't have any socials, just Pinterest) in the name of best friends. Called each other "" I love you"" casually. 

Then fast forwarding to Oct, I confessed to her in Durga Ostomi and she rejected me saying that she was hurt by our recent fights, "" I love you even though that's not the way you wanted""... So we blocked each other after that as I refused to stay as friends . And obviously I was very broken down, bcz she only saw my faults. 
Then 2 weeks later, she texted me with a new number of her mother. Said "" I am sorry, I was really scared, I didn't know what to do... when you said the exact things, I wanted to hear from you for months, I was really scared... So please for once let me prove that I also care about you."" 

""For now you, me, parents, society and all the other shits,.. idc.... I just want you in my life, that's it"" 

""I also don't care about these ( caste, Hindu - Muslim etc.) if we are meant to be, we are meant to be,... who cares.. I don't... and if anything we will move out to Germany or any other places in foreign"" 

I didn't take her every words as acceptable, I was just happy with her intent that she was willing to stand with me as she always had said. I wanted to convince her parents after I get a job after 2-3 years ( I have already qualified GATE 2024) as they were very good people. And I would still have more enough time bcz she has just cleared NEET this year, so even after getting job I would have 2-3 years extra. I know her parents would have had a hard time accepting us initially but bcz we would be independent and they knew me as a person for all these years we could have convinced them ( and her intent made it look more easy). And her parents were more progressive than any other Muslim family I've seen. 
I remember I gave puja for her to lord Shiva on the next day, to a Mandir I had went along with my family on a short trip. 
And of course she told me how she loved me from way back in Feb-March... and many things. 

And the next morning after an hour studying I checked my WhatsApp and found a big text.
"" I have been feeling guilty for past few days, the expectations of parents and responsibilities as a single child can't be ignored. And religious difference adds another layer to it which can't be overlooked even if I try.. 
This is best for us in the long term..... etc. ""

I was willing to to everything possible to make her as much happy as possible. I accepted her even when she had hurt me badly. My parents were stricter than her's still I was prepared to move out if it required. I didn't overlook any problems before confessing her. 
And how are taking responsibility of her parents adversarial to me? This problem will occur for anyone and if it required they can stay with/near us. And in best case scenario if I didn't have to move out.. their house is 20-25 mins away from mine. 
It seems I was just used....as a source of entertainment. She just wanted my attention. And when it required commitment and effort she chose what was convenient to her. I was ready to take 99 steps and she couldn't even take 1.

The same girl who used to say "" I don't give a fuck about society... My papa tells me, not to listen to the society"", "" You should fight for the one you love"". The same girl who used to tell me, I'm her family, when she had no other good friend than me. 
I was her best friend when the popular girls of our class used to avoid her bcz of her skin tone and lack of fashion, I was her best friend when we had a big misunderstanding with her and her then bf used to insult her ( calling ""mid"" and flirting with other girls and put the screenshot on status) and even now when she has glown up. 
Even a few months ago she used to tell me, ""I have no one but you"".. Now I don't know, maybe bcz she has abundance of people, attention... I became a mistake. 

Now I feel like, I was the fool to expect too much. 
So a little advice for others, from me....

Hey everyone, this is my first post on Reddit, and honestly, I‚Äôve never been the kind of person to believe in ghosts or supernatural things. But after what happened that night, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be the same.

I live in Pune, a bustling city in India, where life doesn‚Äôt stop no matter the hour. It was a cold winter evening, and I was at my desk, sipping coffee, lost in my own world. My mom called out and asked me to get some medicine for her. Being the procrastinator that I am, I pushed it off, saying I‚Äôd go later.

Time flew by, and soon it was 11 PM. The streets were quiet, with the kind of eerie calm that only comes late at night. I grabbed my jacket, my bike keys, and headed out to the 24/7 medical store nearby. After picking up the medicine, I felt the urge to go for a late-night ride‚Äîsomething I often do to clear my head.

There‚Äôs a small bridge not too far from my place, surrounded by towering trees and shadowed by tall buildings in the distance. The bridge has a kind of haunting beauty to it, especially at night. Beneath it runs a dam, and when it‚Äôs open, the rushing water creates a mesmerizing, soothing symphony.

Here‚Äôs where things get unsettling: in India, we don‚Äôt bury the dead‚Äîwe cremate them. And this bridge? It has four cremation sites around it‚Äîtwo at either end of the bridge. I didn‚Äôt think much of it. I‚Äôm not superstitious, and honestly, I never believed in ghosts.

It was midnight when I arrived. I parked my bike near the start of the bridge, lit a cigarette, and put on some music. The cold breeze whispered through the trees, and the distant sound of water made the setting almost surreal.

At the far end of the bridge, I noticed a pyre burning‚Äîa body being cremated. I decided to stay where I was and not disturb the rituals. An hour passed, and I felt it was time to head home. But to do that, I‚Äôd have to pass the cremation site.

I started my bike and began riding slowly. The closer I got, the more aware I became of the burning pyre. And then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it‚Äîa shadow.

At first, I thought it was a trick of the light. But as I got closer, the shadow became clearer‚Äîa man, squatting right next to the burning pyre.

I slowed down to get a better look, and what I saw still haunts me to this day. He was scratching his head‚Äîviolently, almost like he was trying to tear his scalp off. His movements were frantic, jerky, and unnatural. His hair was catching fire from the pyre, but he didn‚Äôt seem to care. Instead, he rocked back and forth, making these guttural, animalistic sounds.

My heart froze. Every instinct screamed at me to leave, but my body wouldn‚Äôt move.

Then, he turned.

In a flash, faster than anything I‚Äôve ever seen, he snapped his head toward me. I‚Äôll never forget the sound‚Äîa sharp, crackling zap, like static electricity. His face was illuminated by the flames, and his eyes‚Ä¶ his eyes were hollow, empty pits that seemed to swallow the light around them.

I don‚Äôt know how, but I managed to kill my headlights and twist the throttle, desperate to get away without drawing his attention. But as I passed him, I felt it‚Äîa cold, piercing gaze, as if he was looking straight into my soul.

I didn‚Äôt dare look back. My hands trembled, my body was drenched in sweat despite the cold, and I rode faster than I ever have, praying he wouldn‚Äôt follow.

When I reached home, I locked every door and window, my heart still pounding in my chest. That night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. The next morning, I woke up with a high fever that lasted two days.

When I finally gathered the courage to visit the bridge in daylight, there was nothing. No signs of anyone, no evidence of what I‚Äôd seen. To this day, I don‚Äôt know if it was a ghost, a hallucination, or something else entirely.

But one thing is certain: I‚Äôll never go near that bridge at night again.",3,1733042364.0,TrueScaryStories,2,1.0,False

## FAQ

**I live in Mexico/Canada/El Salvador/USA, why are you posting on a Saturday?!**

Because I'm writing this from Europe in the future where it's already Sunday. Timezones be crazy.

**Why are there a bunch of non-board games in the board game list?**

Because the Tabletop games category on Kickstarter includes anything remotely related to board games and sometimes things slip through my filters.

**Why is this future award winning board game and literal saviour of humanity missing from your list?**

Sometimes my filters get a bit overzealous and discard actually valid projects. If you feel something is missing for this reason, leave a comment and I'll add it (maybe).

**Can I donate all my money to you?**

No

**Can you help me promote my game?**

Please no. I make lists. Nothing more.

**Your list is full of errors and now my coffee is cold!**

Indeed, this fine piece of code runs purely on ten marmosets singing kumbaya in the sunset, so anything can happen. Leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.

I'm a passionate and adventurous soul with an insatiable curiosity for the world. I thrive on new experiences, whether it's exploring distant lands, indulging in diverse cuisines, or simply enjoying a cozy movie night at home. Life, to me, is a series of wonderful adventures, each one a chance to learn, grow, and share with those around me.

### Interests
- **Travel Enthusiast**: I have a deep love for travel and have been fortunate enough to do a bit. I can‚Äôt wait to go on my next adventure.

- **Social Butterfly**: I believe that life is best lived in good company. I cherish my friendships and love meeting new people. Whether it's a casual coffee date or a relaxed evening with friends, I'm always up for socializing and making new connections.

- **Food Explorer**: Trying new foods is one of my greatest joys. I have a curious palate and love trying new food. From street food vendors to fine dining restaurants, I enjoy the full spectrum of culinary experiences. 

- **Board Game Aficionado**: There's something magical about gathering around a table with friends or family for a board game night. I enjoy a wide variety of games, from strategic games to cooperative adventures. It's a fantastic way to challenge the mind and foster camaraderie.

### What I‚Äôm Looking For
I'm searching for someone who shares my zest for life and is ready to embark on new adventures together. A genuine, kind-hearted, and open-minded person who values honesty and communication. Someone who appreciates both the thrill of spontaneous travel and the comfort of a quiet movie night in.

","That was the day Jim ruined a solemn game of chess between two elderly gentlemen under an archway of the Covent Garden Piazza.¬†

The mental combatants were deep in thought over their next sallies. Meditative, ruminating options, minimal eye contact. Memory paints them as rabbinical figures. Behatted, impeccably dressed and trimmed of beard . Wizened scholars of scripture. Well-versed in literature. Able to quote prescient lines of prose and poetry to suit the mood. Solid descendants of the ancients, avatars of calm amid the mad thrashings of capitalism. Antonyms of the stomping shoppers who funneled past them.

I imagine they magnanimously shared a flask of tarry coffee during intermittent breaks and a pungent cigarillo of excellent quality. Reflected on world events, both well informed by early morning perusal of an internationalist broadsheet.

I am 32F. I have a pretty sedentary lifestyle due to my WFH. My fitness routine includes:

6am-7am: Walk+run (I try to hit 5kms daily)  
7am-8am: Gym (moderate weight training + sides/abs exercises)

  
Then once I'm back home, I normally start working from 10am and thats it....I'm pretty much sitting all day.

My diet is as follows: 

* I take a  Methi soaked water + 2 almonds before I go for a run
* Post workout, once I'm back home, I have a cup of coffee (milk but no sugar) with 1-2 biscuits
* Between 10-10:30am I have breakfast: 1 roti & sabzi/2 toasts along with a boiled egg
* 11:30-12pm: Milk tea (no sugar)
* 1:30pm: Lunch (mostly little bit of rice, 1 sabzi, fish/chicken curry, little bit of cucumber, yogurt)
* 3-3:30pm: 1 fruit (apple/orange/mausambi)
* 5pm: Coffee with 1-2 biscuits (no sugar)
* 7pm: Chana/little bit of mungfali & Tea (no sugar)
* 8:30-9pm: Oats omlette (oats, bell pepper, mushroom, 1 whole egg, 1 egg white)

  
Now my problem is my lower body area. I have a pear shaped body and the weight simply wont go away. And the worst part, i think I have gained weight in that area more. Nothing looks good on me. I'm tired. I'm thinking of incorporating 1 hour of exercise in the evning as well. 

I know everyone here knows better than me. I am genuinely looking for advice. Please suggest me modifications in my diet and exercise and recommend me a routine for evening to lose some weight. Thank you :)",2,1733041637.0,Fitness_India,2,1.0,False

I was relieved, because I felt really uncomfortable around her. She acted like I wasn‚Äôt there, wouldn‚Äôt say hello to me, took long showers and occupied the bathroom for ages when I needed to get ready for work, helped herself to my stuff like coffee without asking, turned up and rang the doorbell at 3am, talked really loudly in the kitchen when she turned up at 3am knowing that I had to wake up at 6am, and often spoke to him in a way that I felt was rude and disrespectful. She also hung out in my living for most of the day when I had sporadic and one-off days off, when she lives alone, meaning I felt awkward being in my own living space and would either make excuses to go out or hide in my bedroom. I‚Äôm a very anxious person and have a really hard time coping with situations that make me uncomfortable so I just hide. I think she would come because of my cat, but still. 

Needless to say, I was secretly happy when he told me they‚Äôd broken up, but I comforted him because I know he was a bit heartbroken. I think he had had trouble dating before and this was the longest relationship he‚Äôd had in a while. A few weeks after they broke up they went to have the ‚Äòclosure‚Äô conversation and he came back happily telling me they were thinking of giving it another go when he comes back from the work thing. I‚Äôm absolutely dreading it. With a few months until he comes back I‚Äôve started having anxiety dreams about her being in my apartment and feeling like I have to hide in my bedroom again. 

Should I talk to him about it? What should I even say? I have a pretty good relationship with him, I‚Äôm worried it would make things awkward between us but I also am absolutely dreading her presence. ",1,1733041400.0,roommates,2,0.67,False

1h3yphs,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1h3yphs/i_wrote_this_wondering_if_its_good/,i wrote this wondering if its good,"first time writing it might be shit but I was wondering if people my ga eowuld actually like it and read it or nah be as harsh as you want :    

The phone buzzed like a goddamn alarm clock you couldn‚Äôt turn off, its shrill sound slicing through the silence before it slipped off the table and hit the floor with a sickening crack. Zane groaned, deep and raw, his throat burning from disuse. His body felt like a wreck, stiff and sore, like it had forgotten how to move. His eyes shot open, immediately stinging from the brutal light slicing through the blinds, yanking him into the day like it was out for blood. Zane hated work‚Äînot just because it drained him, but because every second spent there felt like slowly choking on regret. The thought of it twisted inside him, gnawing at his gut like a dull ache that wouldn‚Äôt go away. Every Sunday morning, the clock was his enemy‚Äîyanking him from whatever shitty sleep he could find, dragging him out of bed at 5 AM like it was a cruel joke. His body already protesting what was coming.

Zane stared at the ceiling, fingers gripping the edge of the mattress. His body felt like it was made of cement, weighed down by everything‚Äîthe shitty job, the shitty life, the shitty fucking day ahead. The bed was the only thing that didn‚Äôt expect him to show up for it. He threw the covers over his head like it would block out the world. It didn‚Äôt. Getting up, getting dressed, pretending to be normal? Too much. Too exhausting.

5:20 AM.

Twenty minutes. Just enough time to drag his ass out of bed and pretend like he gave a damn. His stomach churned at the thought of the convenience store, the stale coffee, the buzzing fluorescent lights‚Äîit was all one big repeat. The same thing every day. Nothing ever changed. It was like being stuck in quicksand. He squeezed his eyes shut, but the glow of the clock taunted him like some sick reminder that the world didn‚Äôt give a shit about his problems.

He rolled out of bed, feet hitting the cold floor with a thud. The chill made him flinch, but he didn‚Äôt have the energy to care. He wanted to break something. Scream. Feel anything other than this numbness. But all he did was sit there, staring at the walls. The world outside, his job, everything felt pointless.

He forced himself to stand, his limbs heavy like they weren‚Äôt even his own. The bathroom mirror reflected back a stranger‚Äôs face‚Äîpale, drained, hollow-eyed. His chin-length blue hair hung messily in his face. He hated it. Hated the color. Hated that it reminded him of someone else. He never even liked blue. It was a stupid thing to do. But it was the only color that stuck. The only color that made him feel a little less visible. And, really, it didn‚Äôt matter anyway. No one cared what he looked like. No one ever did.

The world wasn‚Äôt going to wait for him to figure his shit out. So he went through the motions, like always.

The cold hit him as soon as he stepped outside, the kind of bite that made you want to turn back, but he didn‚Äôt. There wasn‚Äôt time. He didn‚Äôt look up as he passed the other tenants of the building, keeping his face blank, his steps quick but controlled. He wasn‚Äôt in the mood for any of their bullshit, their questions, or their pity. He‚Äôd learned to ignore it all.

He walked to the bus stop, avoiding the guy with the stupid dog. The same damn dog. Every morning. He hated dogs. He didn‚Äôt really care, but it was just another thing to dodge.

The train station was a blur of faces, none of them memorable. People moving like zombies, caught up in their own routines. Zane barely had to think about how to avoid them. He knew exactly where to stand, which car to get into, how to make sure no one sat next to him. It was an art, really. People didn‚Äôt want to make eye contact with him, and he was fine with that. He didn‚Äôt want to make eye contact with them either.

He didn‚Äôt even bother to notice how long the ride was. Same as yesterday. Same as every other day. The train screeched as it pulled into the next stop, the world moving too fast for him to care. Why the hell was he even going to work today? Maybe just because he had no other option.

The thought of the convenience store waiting for him made his stomach twist. Same shit, different day. But he was used to it. He didn‚Äôt need to think about it. He just had to get through it. Avoid the customers, avoid the questions, avoid everything that made him feel anything. Keep his head down and move like he was invisible.

At the end of the day, Zane was just another face in the crowd. Nothing more, nothing less.

Whether you‚Äôre searching for a [round rug](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/textiles/rugs/round-rugs) to make a bold statement or exploring options from the finest [rugs Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs) has to offer, finding the perfect rug requires understanding the balance between function and style. In this guide, we‚Äôll walk you through how to choose the ideal rug for every room in your home.

# 1. Living Room: Anchor Your Space

In the living room, a rug serves as the foundation for your furniture layout. Opt for a rug that‚Äôs large enough to fit under the front legs of your sofa and chairs, creating a unified seating area. For smaller living rooms or to highlight a coffee table, a **round rug** can add a dynamic focal point.

# Tips for Styling:

* Choose a neutral-tone rug for versatility or go bold with vibrant patterns for a statement piece.
* Layer rugs to add texture‚Äîtry placing a smaller, patterned rug over a larger natural-fiber rug for added depth.

# 2. Bedroom: Comfort Underfoot

There‚Äôs nothing better than sinking your feet into a plush rug first thing in the morning. For the bedroom, select a rug that extends beyond the bed on all sides for a luxurious look. Alternatively, use smaller rugs on either side of the bed for a cozy feel.

# Best Rug Types for Bedrooms:

* Soft materials like wool or shag for ultimate comfort.
* Subtle patterns or solid colors to create a calming atmosphere.

# 3. Dining Room: Define the Dining Space

In dining areas, rugs help define the space and add elegance. A round dining table pairs beautifully with a **round rug**, creating symmetry and balance. Ensure the rug is large enough for chairs to remain on it, even when pulled out.

# Pro Styling Tip:

* Choose a rug that‚Äôs easy to clean, such as flatweave or synthetic materials, to handle inevitable spills.

# 4. Kitchen: Add a Touch of Warmth

The kitchen might not be the first place you think of for rugs, but they can soften the look of hard floors and add warmth. Use smaller rugs or runners in high-traffic areas like in front of the sink or stove.

# Key Considerations:

* Opt for durable, low-pile rugs that are easy to clean.
* Incorporate bold patterns or colors to make a functional space more inviting.

# 5. Bathroom: Style Meets Practicality

Rugs in bathrooms can elevate the decor while providing comfort and safety. A small **round rug** can be a playful addition near a freestanding tub, while runners work well in front of double sinks.

# Material Matters:

* Choose moisture-resistant materials like cotton or synthetic fibers.
* Non-slip backing is essential for safety.

# 6. Entryway: First Impressions Matter

Your entryway sets the tone for the rest of your home. A well-chosen rug can make a lasting impression while withstanding high foot traffic. Look for durable, stain-resistant materials to keep your entryway looking polished.

# Styling Tip:

* A bold, patterned rug can make a small entryway feel lively and welcoming.

# Why Choose Rugs from Dubai?

Dubai is renowned for its rich tapestry of design and craftsmanship, offering some of the finest rugs in the world. From intricately woven Persian-style rugs to modern, minimalist designs, **rugs Dubai** provide a unique blend of tradition and contemporary elegance. When you shop for **rugs in Dubai**, you‚Äôre investing in quality and style that can elevate your **home decor**.

# Choosing the Right Rug Shape

When it comes to rug shapes, a **round rug** is a versatile option that works in various settings:

* Highlight a centerpiece like a coffee table or chandelier.
* Create intimacy in open spaces by defining a specific area.

Rectangular rugs remain a classic choice for most rooms, providing a structured, balanced look. Experiment with different shapes to find what suits your space best.

# Final Thoughts

Selecting the perfect rug involves more than picking a pattern or color. Consider the size, material, shape, and purpose of the rug to ensure it complements your **home decor** while meeting your practical needs. Whether you‚Äôre shopping for a **round rug** to add personality to your living room or exploring the exquisite options from **rugs Dubai**, the right rug can transform your space into a stylish, welcoming haven.

But then he brought up meet ups and he must‚Äôve asked about meeting up like 800 million times or he would just drop hints like ‚ÄúI wish I could take you out for some coffee or something‚Äù ‚Äúit would be nice if you did meet ups‚Äù he did this for years while still buying content and he would sent lots of money. Anyway, after years of him asking about meet ups and such I just didn‚Äôt know what to say anymore cuz the word no wasn‚Äôt doing much so I just said ‚Äúokay maybe but I am a bit nervous for that though I never met anyone from cam before but I‚Äôll think about it‚Äù Well that was probably not the best thing either because ever since then he has been thinking that this is something more than what it is. 

Anyway, he said he couldn‚Äôt use cash app anymore and would have to use a different payment method so I was like well this different payment method showed my real name!!! I told him okay just please keep that between us and don‚Äôt google search me for any other info and he said I‚Äôm not a stalker. THEENNNNNN a few days later he sent me my address and said ‚ÄúI hope this is the correct address cuz I sent you some stuff‚Äù. I was like wtf!?! He has sent so many gifts to my house and it‚Äôs just stuff that he wants me to have not stuff that I actually want if that makes sense lmao. He doesn‚Äôt ask for content anymore either and thinks that we are on the verge of becoming some happy ending fairytale couple‚Ä¶ a few months ago I told him that I think that he got the wrong idea and that I basically didn‚Äôt want to continue this anymore and he said some things that made me feel like he was going to leak my stuff especially when he made a new username that said ‚Äúdoxx*myrealname*‚Äù then he requested that I send him $430 for wasting his time or else it will get ugly or something like that. He does not respect my boundaries or privacy whatsoever because he wants to feel different and special from all the other regulars. He gets jealous of my other regulars too. He paid me $200 to delete all
Pics and vids I have with my ex. He said he doesn‚Äôt want me to cam anymore. And the worst part of it all is he knows my children names. I asked how do you know their names? And he said ‚Äúyour fb‚Äù WTF I have a whole different name on there so how he found that is beyond me. He doesn‚Äôt respect when I tell him no. I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do. By the way I moved to a different house and he wants this address now but I said no sorry I don‚Äôt want to share my new address and he got so offended like omg. I can‚Äôt have any privacy with him. He is severely obsessed with me and I have no idea why",4,1733040746.0,CamGirlProblems,8,0.84,False
