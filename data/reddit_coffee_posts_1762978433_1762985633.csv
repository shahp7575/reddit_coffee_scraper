I’m hoping for some guidance or insight into my situation.

I’m a Canadian citizen, and while visiting the United States, I rented a vehicle from Budget Car Rental and drove it to Alaska. While driving, the vehicle suddenly malfunctioned — all of the brakes engaged at once. The seatbelt locked abruptly, which caused me to spill hot coffee on myself and injure my shoulder and neck.

I’m now back in Canada receiving medical care. My doctor says something appears to be protruding from my shoulder, and I’m still dealing with neck pain and stiffness that requires pain medication.

I’ve reached out to several U.S. personal injury and product liability lawyers, but so far, none of them seem interested in taking the case. I’m not sure if that’s because it’s a cross-border issue, the rental company involved, or the type of injury.

I’m trying to understand:

* What kind of lawyer or firm would normally handle something like this (e.g., product liability vs. personal injury)?
* Is this the kind of case that’s hard to pursue because I’m Canadian and the incident happened in the U.S.?
* Should I try contacting Budget’s claims department or the vehicle manufacturer directly, or wait until I find a lawyer?
* Are there any specific U.S. states or firms that handle cross-border claims involving Canadian citizens?

I’m not looking for direct legal representation here—just trying to understand my options and next steps, since I haven’t had much luck finding a lawyer who’ll even review the case.

Thanks in advance for any advice or experience you can share.

1ovj7kr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ovj7kr,A custom VHS 📼 I had made with lots of cool Twin Peaks and David Lynch material,"I collect VHS 📼 and sometimes I get custom ones made if the movie was never released on VHS. There is a guy named Eric on Etsy that I’ve bought from multiple times and his work is always great and he collaborates with you until everything is perfect. He will ask for your input, ask which cover you want (because movies have different images for their releases). This is the first custom I’ve done with Eric where I fully 80% collaborated with him. I basically told him exactly what I wanted and worked with him on the cover art, title, description on the back, and the images for the back. He has different options you can choose from for how long the tape is (that reflects the price). Everything on here is from YouTube. These are all videos from YouTube. I just copy and pasted the link and he took care of it from there. The quality of the tape is 100% and I absolutely LOVE how it came out! 
What’s on the 📼:
-Kyle MacLachlan’s SNL appearance
-Georgia Coffee Ads
-Original Twin Peaks Spot
-Night Life Interview with Kyle MacLachlan
-Artforum Interview with David Lynch 
-BTS of Twin Peaks
-The Early Work of David Lynch: 16MM Experiments of David Lynch, Alphabet
-Rabbits
-Montage of David Lynch clips

It’s always a pleasure to work with Eric. If you collect VHS and need a custom made definitely hit up Eric!! His username is: phazonvideos
I’ll link him in the comments!

1ovj70y,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1ovj70y/my_boyfriend_keeps_joking_about_me_slapping_him/,"My boyfriend keeps joking about me “slapping” him after ignoring my boundaries, and I feel completely gaslit","YES, I ran this through chat for grammatical reasons LOL but I promise this is 100% real and I am pressed about this whole situation.

I (31 F) have been dating this guy for a little while. Things moved *really* fast — we got close quickly, went public, etc. His support through an unexpected medical emergency on my behalf is ultimately what catapulted our relationship.

A couple days ago, things went left. He came over upset after a racial disagreement with a coworker. I could tell he was frustrated, but I wanted him to feel comfortable venting so I allowed it for a little under an hour. Even though his energy was off, I dont want to say it was negative because that would be insensitive but his energy was negative lol and I wasn’t really “in the mood,” anymore I tried to be supportive and at one point allowed him to kiss me like we would normally do because it just felt like the natural comforting thing to do.

After a few kisses though, i started to get the ick, he started tickling me and trying to keep kissing me even after I said stop — multiple times. At first it was playful, like “stopppp,” but then it became serious. I started pushing his face and hands away and clearly said things like, “Stop,” “I hate being tickled,” “I don’t want to kiss right now anymore.” He ignored every single cue.

Finally, I instinctively *tapped* his cheek — not a slap, not hard at all, just a physical “stop” after my words weren’t working. He immediately got dramatic about it, saying “omg you slapped me"", and basically kept bringing it up the remainder of the evening in a jokingly but  possible serious manner. After basically co-existing the rest of the night, we fell asleep and ended up getting in bed together but no sex obviously nor the usual cuddling.

Now the next day, on our coffee run he keeps bringing it up “jokingly,” but in this covertly serious, manipulative way. It’s every chance he gets. I’m in total defense mode, and it’s making me shut down emotionally. I can barely make eye contact with him. He said something like ""don't ever slap him again"" and that if I wouldn’t want him to slap me, I shouldn’t do it to him. He didn’t mention anything about pain or an eye issue until the *next day,* when he suddenly claimed his eye was “sore.” There was zero swelling or mark — and I know for a fact I didn’t hit him anywhere near his eye. I literally tapped his mid/lower CHEEK. I wholeheartedly apologized  multiple times both days BUT I did reiterate to him that I asked him to stop multipleeeeee times and I am extremely uncomfortable with being tickled and I told him he may not be aware of any sexual trauma i may have in regards to stuff like that so if i say stop then it means stop. He said he will be mindful of that but to still never hit him again. And thats my issue, he's making it seem like I attacked him, and hes not taking accountability for being the one that initiated physical contact in the first place!!!

What really messes with my head is that he works in legal consulting, so he phrases things in this precise, almost courtroom-style way that makes me feel like I’m being cross-examined instead of listened to. It brings up the same powerless feeling I used to get as a kid when my mom (who was a lawyer) would twist things around to make me doubt myself.

I’m just… disappointed. I still can’t believe how he made me feel. I know life goes on, and I *can* move on, but I’ll never forget that moment — how small, confused, and unheard I felt. And it sucks.

At this point, I’m trying to figure out if I should just quietly detach and move on, or if there’s any point in trying to have another conversation about boundaries with someone who clearly doesn’t respect them.",1,1762985390.0,AskWomenOver30,0,0.66,False

1ovj6ps,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1ovj6ps/imogens_night_please_critique/,Imogen’s Night - Please critique,"   Imogen’s Night
By Victoria Salter.

The moment that I came in on her was like the moment that a deer is caught in headlights. She looked at me, wide-eyed and afraid, every ounce of guilt within her reflected by her scared expression.
 I looked at her, and for a moment, I was almost tempted to pardon her crimes because of the fear and unquestionable admittance of guilt displayed in her expression. Yet, I knew that this child before me, this supposed beacon of six-year old innocence, deserved to be put away for good.
 The evidence was clear enough, even without her expression of childish fear and expectation of punishment. She had murdered, sure enough. There was no blood, but there had been pain, undoubtedly.
 I decided to try to approach this scared and obviously guilty child in a friendly and kind manner. It was for the judge and jury to decide her fate, not me.
 “Imogen,” I began. “You can tell me everything. I will have to pass this on to the people in the court, but I can promise you’ll be looked after. You have been a bad girl, but we don’t kill people who have in this country. I want you to be completely honest with me, but you will be well-looked after and you can take any toys you like with you in my police car. I can’t promise that you’ll get to keep them, but I can promise that I will give you ice cream, if you tell me exactly what happened tonight.”
 “I don’t feel like talking,” Imogen replied. She turned her back to me.
 I knocked on her bedroom door.
 “Go away!” Imogen shouted.
 “It’s okay,” I reassured. “I’m not like the other nasty policemen. I’m your friend. I will have to take you with me, but I want to talk to you.” 
 A few moments passed. I shrugged decided to enter her room. I sat down on the bed next to her.
 “Look, if you tell me what actually happened tonight, I won’t pass on the full story to the other policemen.”
 Imogen looked at me, concerned but also somewhat rude and defensive.
 I smiled at her and put my arm around her. I reached into my pocket and pulled out a lollipop that I had been planning on adding to my bucket of sweets to give out to trick-or-treaters. I handed it to Imogen.
 She looked at me and smiled, almost coldly. “Alright, I’ll tell you.”
 “Mummy and Daddy said they loved me. Mummy would make my packed lunch every day for school. Jam sandwiches are my favourite.”
 “I like jam sandwiches, too,” I said to her, smiling. “Did you ever think that Mummy or Daddy didn’t love you?”
 “Yeah,” she replied. “I don’t think they loved me when I was naughty because they would get cross with me.”
 I laughed a little. “You know, your mummy and daddy still loved you when you were naughty, even if they got cross. Parents often get cross with their kids because they love them.”
 “How can you love someone and be cross with them? Surely doesn’t love always mean they just do nice things like buying you toys and sweets and giving you kisses and cuddles.”
 I shook my head. “In order for your mummy and daddy to love you properly, they needed to teach you how to behave. Otherwise, you would get into worse situations. For instance, if you were naughty and a mean person really didn’t like that, they could hurt you. But your mummy and daddy were always there to protect you. You have been very, very naughty. But I don’t believe you’re a bad kid entirely. I believe that good people can sometimes do terrible, naughty things. So carry on with your story, please. Just make sure it’s all true as well, please. I have my ways of knowing when little girls are lying.”
 “I don’t lie,” she said, looking at me, all wide-eyed as if she were as innocent as a puppy.
 “Anyhow, it all started when I went to school on Monday. There’s this mean girl in school. Her name is Jessica Moore. When I went into school on Monday, she fibbed to my best friend Jolanna that I had fleas.”
 “Why did she do that?”
 “Because she’s horrible! She also elbowed me, and at break time, she held me down on the gravel in our playground and told me to put stones in my mouth. I said no, but she picked up some stones anyway and put them in my mouth. She then kicked me over onto the tarmac and I grazed my knee! When we went back in, I kicked her over in the hall. Miss Copper saw it and said that I had to stay in after school.”
 I was shocked. This little girl had been forced to put stones in her mouth and kicked over onto tarmac! 
 “Imogen,” I asked. “Why didn’t you tell a teacher?”
 “No one likes a snitch.”
 “No, Imogen,” I said, looking into her eyes. “The one thing that bullies hate is being told on. If you had told a teacher, Jessica could’ve been punished. You should not have kicked her over, though. Two wrongs don’t make a right. But, if you had told a teacher, Jessica would’ve been punished worse than you.”
 “But I was scared! I didn’t want Jessica to get cross at me!”
 “The teachers could’ve protected you, though.”
 “Not Miss Copper. She’s mean! On Tuesday, she also kept me in for a fight I didn’t start. George pushed me over, and I pushed him back, and then we started hitting each other. I tried telling Miss Copper that he started it, but she just blamed me because she only saw me hit George to start with.”
 “Two wrongs don’t make a right. You should’ve just ignored him, walked away and told a teacher. But what happened next?”
 Imogen paused to look at me, her eyes wider than ever. “I had won a sticker that day because I had been a good girl in English. Miss Copper tried to take it off of me and I bit her.”
 “Why didn’t you do that? Biting a teacher is very serious and a very naughty thing to do.”
 “Because she was trying to take my sticker off of me!”
 “You NEVER bite people, though, Imogen.”
 “Are you going to arrest me for biting Miss Copper?”
 “No,” I said, chuckling slightly. “That was a very bad thing to do, but I appreciate you being honest. I’m not going to arrest you for that, though.”
 “Miss Copper told my parents. They were very cross. They said I couldn’t have sweets all week. But they still let me have dessert that night. Just no sweets for the rest of this week.”
 “Then what happened?”
 “When I went back to school on Wednesday, I screamed and ran away from the classroom. I like screaming. I like the sound and feeling of it.”
 “Do you like the sound of other people screaming or just yourself?”
 “I like it either way. When I scream, I like the sound and feeling of it. When other people scream, I like the sound of it. It’s loud, but I like it.”
 “But when people scream, it’s usually because they’re hurt or scared.”
 She shrugged. “Other people hurt me, so why shouldn’t I like hurting them?”
 “Just because other people hurt you doesn’t mean you should wish for them to be hurt. That’s horrible.”
 “If other people are horrible to me, why shouldn’t I be horrible to them?”
 “Because, if everyone thought like that, there’d be a lot more horrible in the world. But carry on, please.”
 “Miss Copper kept me in at break time. I was meant to be writing “I must not scream or run away,” a hundred times on some lined paper, but I had an idea. I wasn’t allowed any sweets at home, so I thought I’d  try and steal someone else’s snack, if anyone had left anything behind. So I looked in all the kids’ drawers and found a packet of biscuits that Charlotte Nicholson had left behind in her drawer. I pinched it. I eated it. When Charlotte found out that it was gone, she began to cry. She told Miss Copper. Since I was the only one in the room during break time, and she found out in Maths, Miss Copper knew it must’ve been me that took it. She called my mummy. I know this because I snook out of class and listened to her talking on the phone.”
 “If an adult steals, that is a serious crime, Imogen. You can’t steal. But carry on, please.”
 “When my mummy came to collect me, she told me off about it. I asked if she was cross. She said that she wasn’t cross, just disappointed. She said that I now wasn’t allowed sweets for a month! It was so unfair! If she hadn’t said no sweets for a week, I wouldn’t’ve taken them. So that night, when my parents were in the living room, watching some boring grown-up programme, I decided to try and take some chocolate from Daddy’s secret stash. He usually keeps it locked, but I decided to try anyway. Anyhow, when I opened the cupboard, which had been left unlocked, there was a RAT in there! I screamed and ran into the living room, shouting “Mummy, Daddy! There’s a rat in the cupboard!” Mummy and Daddy both came out and had a look. Mummy gasped at the rat. She said we’d have to get some rat poison tomorrow.”
 I didn’t really agree with poisoning an innocent animal, but I kept schtum as I didn’t want the conversation to go off-track.
 “The next day at school, I was late because I ran away from my mummy. I wanted to go into the post office and buy some sweeties with the pocket money that I always secretly carry with me in my pocket. Mummy caught me, though. She made me hold her hand and walk with her to school or else she’d make me go without sweets for two months! When we got into school, assembly had already started. Mummy had to explain to Miss Copper why I was late. I got kept in at break time again. I got bored with being made to write “I must not be late,” at about the third line. I was meant to write it out twenty times. I began running up and down and screaming. I enjoyed it, but then Miss Copper came in and made me sit down and carry on writing. When she had left, I was looking around the classroom and I saw some paints on the side. I decided that, if the monster was going to be horrible to me, I would be horrible to her. I ran over to the paints. They were wet. They are never wet, but this time they were. So I got my hands on them and wriggled and dug my fingers around in them to ruin them. I then ran outside to the playground, screaming. I ran up and showed my hands to Miss Copper. I fibbed to her that I didn’t know how they got paint all over them. She walked with me back to the classroom and told me to go and wash my hands at the classroom sink. When I was washing them, she found out what I’d done to the paints. She yelled, “See me after school, again!” So I stayed in after school. I decided to actually finish my lines and at least sit still and pretend to listen while Miss Copper told me off. Miss Copper rang my mummy and told her what I’d done. When Mummy came to pick me up, she said she was incredibly disappointed in me. My parents were very sad with me that night, but they still let me have a little dessert after tea.”
 I was so shocked at this story of continuous bad behaviour, I was almost speechless. Then I remembered I was talking to a young murderer. “It’s okay, Imogen, carry on, please.”
 “Anyhow, that brings me to today. When I went to school today, Jessica and Charlotte were both standing there by the school entrance. Jessica shoved me into the corner. I hit her! Charlotte hit me. I hit her as well. I pushed both of them out of the way and ran up and down the corridor, shouting, “I hate you both! Charlotte and Jessica stink!” over and over again. Miss Green came out of her classroom. Then, Mr Oakes came out of his classroom. Then, Miss Cornell came out of her classroom. Then, Miss Copper came out of her classroom. Then, Mr Morrisey came out of his office. Mr Morrisey is the headmaster and he can get really scary. Jessica and Charlotte just walked away and smiled. Mr Morrisey said, “My office, NOW!” and pointed towards his office. He was REALLY cross and spent the rest of the morning telling me off. He also made me write out, “I must not hit,” 20 times. At break time, when I went to get my snack, I found that someone had taken my biscuits and left a rock there instead. I told Miss Copper. She said that she thought Jessica and Charlotte had probably done it, but she also said we shouldn’t just assume without talking to them. But I thought it made sense that it would’ve been them that would’ve done it because they’re mean. So I went looking for them. When I found them, they were in the library. I said, “Someone took my snack and left a rock in my drawer instead! Was it you two?” They said no, but I didn’t believe them. I began to cry. They asked what I was crying about. “Someone took my snack,” I said. Charlotte said, “Well it wasn’t us, so beat it!” “Don’t want to,” I told them. “We’re trying to discuss our evil plans to take over the world, so go away,” said Jessica. “Don’t want to,” I said. Jessica grabbed me and pushed me away. I ran back into the library and picked up a book from a shelf. It was a Bible and I threw it at Jessica and hit her head. Of course, she hollered and went snivelling off to Mr Morrisey’s office. She must’ve told him because the next thing I know he’s standing at the other end of the corridor, shouting, “How DARE you throw the Word of God at another child?! Horrible child!” I ran because I was scared. He didn’t hurt me, but he went back into his office and I heard him on the phone to my mummy. He told her to come and get me. When she came, she was very sad and cross with me. She told me off all the way home. That night, when I asked for a dessert, Mummy said “No way, you don’t deserve it!” I began to scream and cry. They were being so unfair! I decided to go and raid Daddy’s chocolate stash. They were in the dining room and Daddy’s chocolate stash is in the kitchen, so I knew they wouldn’t notice until later when I would’ve already had the chocolate. On the worktop, was the box of rat poison. I had an evil idea. Since I couldn’t have dessert, why should anyone else? I looked in the box, but there was none there. What if the rat had eaten all the poison? I thought I’d check the cupboard, though. There was a whole plateful of rat poison that hadn’t been eaten in there, next to the chocolate. I eated all the chocolate and then took the rat poison and went into the living room. Mummy and Daddy was watching a boring grown-up programme again. They wasn’t watching their coffee. So I putted about half of the poison into Mummy’s cup and then I putted the other half into Daddy’s cup. They both had their spoons in the cups so I used them to mix it and break up the poison. They was too busy watching telly to notice. All over the weekend, it was terrible. Mummy and Daddy was really sick and we had the ambulance out and the doctors tried to get them to be sick more, but they was already puking up blood everywhere. It was yucky. They took them away to hospital but they died. The doctors found out that they had eated rat poison, though. Did they tell you?”
 I was speechless. I didn’t know whether to be furious or just deeply concerned about this child’s mental health and the seriousness of all this. When I finally found the words, I said, sternly, “Imogen, this is extremely serious. You have been a very, very, very, VERY naughty girl! Killing another person is murder! You could be in prison for the rest of your life now! You WILL quite possibly be in prison for the rest of your life!”
 Imogen looked terrified and began to cry. What I saw was not just another murderer, but a bullied and deeply troubled little girl.
 “Imogen, I’m afraid you will likely be in prison for a very, very long time. But, if you’ll allow me to be your daddy and be good to you and visit you, and bring you sweets and desserts, I would love that very much.”
 “I would love that very much, too,” she said sweetly.
 And I do visit her every day when I can. She will live out the rest of her days in the Young Offenders Institute, or in jail, when she comes of age. But she will always have a Daddy that loves her.
 As for the outside world, a part of me wishes they would understand that  child offenders grow up and change just like every other child. But I think the spray paint reads, “Imogen Meckers is a devil child,” on a wall near Morbrook C of E Primary School is permanent.

In the beginning, my stomach pain was unbearable. It was so intense that on the very first day, I had to go to the emergency room. The burning and tightness were constant, every meal felt like a struggle, and I was exhausted by a body that seemed to betray me.

For months, I tried multiple treatments: Gaviscon, Exonn One, several PPIs… but none brought real relief. I felt stuck, as if I would never escape this cycle of pain and discomfort.

Nine months after the onset of these symptoms, I tried a one-week FODMAP diet, which brought my first real relief. For the first time, I felt my stomach calm down, even though the road to recovery was still long. The pain returned afterward, reminding me that recovery is a slow, gradual process that requires patience and persistence.

Eventually, I found lasting balance through a combination of simple, natural changes:
	•	Meditation, which helped ease the stress often linked to digestive pain.
	•	Bianacid medication, which finally stabilized my digestive system.
	•	And a daily marjoram and chamomile tea, which helps relax both the stomach and the mind.

Today, the burning is rare and mild. I can eat almost anything, including coffee and a little alcohol, and I finally live a normal life. My mouth is more hydrated, my digestion is improving, and I am gradually regaining my daily comfort.

This journey taught me that you must never give up, and that it’s essential to understand that remission takes time. Every small relief, every minor improvement, is a victory worth celebrating. Patience, listening to your body, and perseverance are the real keys to regaining

I'm new to running and have been training now for a bit over 2 months. I do about 5 runs a week with friends, 3 hard workouts (intervals, tempo and long runs), rest are easy runs.

I noticed on my Garmin that my heart rate on my hard workouts is very high, I usually hit 180-200 during my intervals, 170-190 during tempo runs. and 160-180 on long runs. Even my easy run heart rate is above my ""Zone 2"" pace, because I just can't seem to get my hr under 150. During my half marathon race I averaged 185, and ended at almost 200.

I'm wondering if this is normal, and just an anomaly because I'm new to the sport, or if I'm doing my training wrong and need to adjust. Apart from some shin splints I had for a couple weeks I seem to be recovering fine, I haven't been getting sick.

I'm 21 years old, male. The weather has been in the 70s so not too hot during my runs. And I don't take coffee or anything.

And I actually did it.

When it comes to painting scenery, I’ve learned one thing: the more brushes, the better. Big ones, small ones, and as many colors as you can fit on the table. Don’t be afraid to mix unexpected tones like turquoise greens or purples on stone and wood. It brings everything to life.

Here are some of the test shots. They’re still a bit rough, but I’m really happy with how it all came together.

Hope you like them.

1ovj1de,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMedical/comments/1ovj1de/strep_throat_how_bad_did_i_mess_up/,Strep Throat - How Bad Did I Mess Up?,"So, for context, I’m a 28F with autoimmune issues on immunosuppressants. About 3 weeks ago, I went to the doc and was diagnosed with strep throat (a multi-yearly occurrence). It was terrible and I was down for the count for a while. 

During the bulk of the feel-bads, I was walking around with a mug for spitting, because I was coughing up phlegm like crazy.

It was relatively sticky (disgusting, I know), so I did my best to rinse it out before running it through the dishwasher twice. I put the mug away, never to use it again until last night when I made some tea in it. 

When I pulled the mug out, it had what looked like a brown stain on it, which I chalked up to many years of coffee holding. I finished my tea, and reach in to get the bag out of the mug only to realize the stain is now sticky. A moment more of thought and I realized it was my strep phlegm.

Cut to now, approximately 24 hours later, and I’ve got a mild fever, body and head ache, chills, and I can feel the same scratch in my throat I felt weeks ago. 

So, all that is to ask, do y’all think I just gave myself strep again, or am I freaking myself out for no reason?",1,1762985033.0,AskMedical,0,1.0,False
1ovj193,https://i.redd.it/1b58xinmfw0g1.jpeg,Confusing Days / Part 46,"How will the reunion at the Radio station end?


What is Miharu planning?


Ruka gains new determination.

*I will leave the links to the previous parts in the comments. The entire story is linked for better tracking. If you have not yet read the previous parts, I recommend doing so before starting this chapter.*


---


**Two family reunions occur almost simultaneously and, although each unfolds in different locations, both entail an enormous emotional burden. Sumi's past collides with her present without warning, only to seek to initiate a new conflict.**


**The weather changes drastically: less than fifteen minutes ago it was a sunny day, but now, the rain arrives suddenly and begins to fall violently, without giving people walking in the streets time to find shelter, leaving them soaked.**


---


**While outside the sky is falling due to the violent storm that is occurring, inside the local radio station, in the main waiting room, no one pays attention to the weather. Each of the women is concentrated on the conflict unfolding before them. At this moment, Kiyomi finishes speaking with a last sentence full of insults directed at Sumi.**


Kiyomi: ""(...) Although it was to be expected. Girls like you, the withdrawn ones, always end up being the easiest and most vulgar of them all.""


**Sumi, with her gaze lost in nothingness, can only painfully listen to every word of contempt that comes out of Kiyomi's mouth. However, her friends have arrived, intervening in the discussion directly. Chizuru is the first to speak.**


Chizuru: ""Good afternoon, ma'am. With all due respect, I ask you to leave. I don't know who you are, but I have heard enough and I will not allow you to continue assaulting my friend in this way. I will not allow you to continue with your aggression, but I don't want to fight, we are adults, just leave us alone. Let's not make this bigger. I won't repeat it again, leave here right now.""


**Kiyomi listens to her, but ignoring her words, she responds with arrogance.**


Kiyomi: ""Excuse me? And who do you think you are? Why should I obey you? Let me tell you something: I was this girl's mother, and I am not interested in what a 'friend' of hers has to say. Don't interfere in a conversation between family members, you insolent girl. I am talking to her, I am just telling her the truth, I am not assaulting her at all, we have always talked like this, right, Sumi?""


**Sumi continues looking down at the floor, she cannot stop trembling from the nerves and fear she feels, so she is unable to say a single word to affirm or deny Kiyomi's question. Kiyomi, seeing her lack of response, gets annoyed, but speaks again, only to pretend to be a kind person, although she fails by continuing with her disguised scorn.**


Kiyomi: ""You've always been like this, poor thing, but don't worry, you don't have to say anything. I will fix this misunderstanding, you stay there, as always, like the pretty doll who doesn't know how to speak for herself.""


**Kiyomi finishes speaking and slowly brings her hand toward Sumi's face, but before reaching her goal, Chizuru intervenes, grabbing her arm, while saying:**


Chizuru: ""Don't you dare touch her. I don't care who you are, but leave her alone now. I know a lot of people like you, I know when someone is acting, and as an actress that I am, let me tell you that your performance is very disappointing.""


**The receptionist can't help but get scared witnessing how the conflict continues to worsen, therefore, she picks up her landline phone and calls security.**


**At the same time, Kiyomi tries to break free from Chizuru's grip, but fails, only managing to free herself the moment Chizuru decides to let go. Out of fear, she moves a few meters away from the two girls and, now, more irritated and annoyed than before, she speaks again, but genuinely this time.**


Kiyomi: ""How dare you touch me? Don't you have any shame? What an ill-mannered girl!... Ohh, I get it now, you're the actress from the news everyone is talking about, right? Hahaha, what could I expect from a vulgar woman like you? You're just a common slut! How disgusting! Now I'll have to wash my arm with bleach, just imagining what things you must have touched makes me feel like throwing up. And yet you have the nerve to act offended? Hahaha. You don't have the moral quality to talk to me like that, not after knowing your story. Besides, don't you care about having tainted this poor mute girl? You even exposed her to the public! What a despicable woman.


**Chizuru listens to her, but just ignores her; there's no need to respond to her, she knows very well who she is. She won't waste her time on someone like her. Sumi, ever since she heard Chizuru nearby, has been staring at her in surprise; she never expected to see her so angry.**


**However, Mini is the one who speaks this time, saying:**


Mini: ""Wow, I didn't know a person could be so ignorant! Didn't you hear anything Sumi said? She made it very clear. Only an unintelligent person like you would say something like that, it's unbelievable. I will never be able to understand how there are still so many people like this who can accuse so easily without even understanding what they are talking about. They always end up being second-hand embarrassment.""


**Every word Mini says only makes Kiyomi's anger increase, until it surpasses her limit and she explodes. Kiyomi turns and looks at Mini with hatred, starting to walk in her direction, shouting multiple insults as she approaches.**


**Chizuru notices the danger and goes to help her. However, Mini asks her to stop with her hand, leaving her very confused. Sumi, realizing the gravity of the situation, panics, fearing for Mini's safety.**


**Even with all the danger upon her, Mini does not succumb to fear. She takes out her phone, places it on a selfie stick, and speaks mockingly again, looking at the camera.**


Mini: ""Wow! I didn't think she would react so violently! How scary! Help, friends, a wild beast wants to hit me, chat! Do you think she's going to sink her reputation even further? What do you say, kind audience? Place your bets! Who will win this duel?""


**That unexpected action leaves the three women very surprised, even Kiyomi, who stops and listens attentively. Realizing what is happening, she panics and starts inventing excuses in an attempt to clear her image before the public.**


Kiyomi: ""Hahaha! What are you talking about? We are friends, I couldn't even think of doing anything... that dialogue wasn't in the script! Don't change the scene like that! You're taking me out of character. Let's try again another day, I'm exhausted, I need to go eat. Take good care of yourselves, girls, I'll see you later!""


**Kiyomi quickly heads to the hallway and walks to the elevator, thoughtful.**


Kiyomi (Thought): ""That damn woman! When did she start recording? Damn, this is bad, very bad! Why didn't I realize? I just hope they bought my excuse. This won't look good if it reaches my bosses, damn! Damn girls! I'm not finished with you! If this affects me, I swear I will look for you and make your lives a hell.""


**Back in the waiting room, Mini lets out a sigh of relief, puts away her cell phone, and walks over to the two girls, saying:**


Mini: ""How was that? Just as I expected, it worked perfectly. Since I saw she had a badge, I knew she worked here; I knew this was going to work. Exposing the villain is a classic! Although my battery is dead, hahaha.""


**Sumi fails to understand what Mini is referring to, looking at her confused. Chizuru, on the other hand, almost immediately grasps the reference. Something that makes her quite angry and, looking at Mini, she speaks:**


Chizuru: ""Are you serious, Mini? What were you thinking? How could you fake something like that? What if you were wrong and the woman didn't pay attention to you and reached you? You seriously never think about the consequences! But... thanks for your help, I didn't know what else to do to make her leave... But don't you dare do it again!""


Mini: ""Relax! It's nothing. If she didn't fall into the trap, I planned to run far away from here; everything was calculated, I would never do something without a plan B. By the way, I've never seen you like this. Is this your yandere mode? How scary!""


**Chizuru continues arguing with Mini for a few more minutes. Afterward, the two girls talk to Sumi, trying to cheer her up a bit. With the atmosphere calmer, they decide to leave, but for the first time, they notice the violent storm that is falling, leaving them with no choice but to wait a bit for the rain to subside so they can leave.**

**While the three are waiting to leave the radio station, not far from there, at the Sakurasawa Residence, another encounter is still active. Miharu is waiting in the living room, while Satoshi is in the kitchen preparing tea and getting a package of cookies to go with it. However, while his body does everything almost automatically, his mind is wandering.**


Satoshi (Thought): ""What is happening? What is Miharu doing here? When did she arrive? Did she come alone or with her mother? I'm very happy to see her here again, but why did she come? I don't know, it doesn't matter, for now, I must make her feel at home while she is here.""


**A minute later, Satoshi arrives with a tray, giving Miharu a glass of tea and leaving the cookies on a plate right in the middle of the coffee table. Miharu takes a sip of tea, grabs a cookie, and immediately speaks.**


Miharu: ""After all these years apart, I had forgotten the taste of this tea. Now that I drink it again, my memories of those days become clearer. They were good times, weren't they, Dad?""


Satoshi: ""Of course, I still remember as if it were yesterday those days when you spent all day playing and singing with your sister. I will never forget it... But, tell me, when did you come back? Did your mother come too? Why did you come like this? You should have let me know, and I could have organized a better welcome with Sumi.""


**Miharu listens carefully, but the simple mention of her sister is a total annoyance. Even so, she contains her rejection and thinks for a second about a convincing excuse. An instant later, Miharu speaks again.**


Miharu: ""I know! I didn't plan to come like this, suddenly, but I couldn't wait any longer! My mother and I arrived in Tokyo just a few hours ago, she is at her television job right now, so I decided to come here alone, I wanted to see you again after so much time. I'm sorry if it was too unexpected, it was not my intention, excuse my manners.""


**Satoshi listens to her and can't help but be moved. He always thought he would never see her again and now she is here, in his house with him, saying she wants to see him; words that for years he could only hear in his deepest dreams. With contained emotion, Satoshi replies.**


Satoshi: ""Don't worry, it's okay, you can come whenever you want, this is still your house, no matter how many years pass. You will always be welcome. Sumi will be very happy to see you too. After the separation, Sumi spent several days sad without her little sister, and whenever we go to the temple for New Year's, she asks the gods to be able to see you again soon. She will be delighted by your visit!""


**Miharu listens to him, but does not believe a single word about Sumi. Internally, she cannot accept anything Sumi says as truth. In her mind, she only remembers what her mother said: Sumi was to blame for the family separating, it's impossible that she wants to see her, she only says it to look like a good girl in her father's eyes, it's all a vile deception. Her anger increases a little due to all the above, but she manages to maintain her composure. Faking her reaction, Miharu replies cheerfully.**


Miharu: ""Really? I do the same thing! I have always waited for this day, hoping to be able to talk to her again! By the way, where is she now? What has she been doing all these years?""


Satoshi: ""Sumi should be here by now, but she's probably waiting for the rain to subside a bit to come. Sumi must still be at the radio station, since she went there today for an interview. Didn't you hear her while you were coming here? It was incredible! I couldn't be prouder of the woman she has become. And as for what she has done during these years, I couldn't give you many details, but I think she has had a normal and quiet life: she spends her days doing her school duties, walking her dog, and practicing calligraphy as my apprentice, with great dedication.""


**Miharu internally hides all the anger and jealousy she feels hearing her father praise Sumi, but manages to maintain her role as a compassionate younger sister.**


Miharu: ""How incredible! It's great that she's having a good time, it's a relief to hear it. It's just a shame, but I haven't listened to the radio at all; I was only thinking about coming to say hello. I showered, found the address, and came here, I didn't have time to think about anything else, I just wanted to see you all again. But now I'm curious, why did my sister go to the radio? As I recall, she was always very afraid of public speaking, what happened that made her decide to do something like that?""


Satoshi: ""Well, it's something complicated to explain, and it's also a somewhat delicate and personal subject. I don't want to say the wrong thing, so why don't we wait for Sumi to arrive? It will be much better for her to tell you everything herself, I'm sure she'll be very happy to talk about it with you.""


**Miharu listens to him with a smile on her face; however, deep down she feels great frustration. She's not interested in hearing the same thing from her again, she already heard it before. She just wanted to know what her father thought to find something she could use to expose all her lies to him. Even so, she continues with her performance as an understanding sister.**


Miharu: ""Don't worry, Dad, I understand, I'll ask her everything when she arrives. I would also be delighted to hear the whole story! I hope she doesn't take too long to come back! While we wait for her, tell me, what have you been doing all this time? I'm very curious to know more about you, Dad!""


**The conversation continues for several more minutes, talking only about the things each one has done during their time apart. Satoshi tells her how he spends his days inside his studio, working with great emotion and dedication to always create pieces of excellent quality, while Miharu tells him about several experiences she has lived due to the constant moves she has had every time her mother changes jobs, which has caused her to never have a stable normal school life.**


Leaving aside the mention of Sumi and only focusing on talking about their lives, the conversation flows better, causing Miharu to leave behind her facade of kindness for real emotions. For a few minutes, the conversation becomes warm; it is just a friendly chat between father and daughter without any hidden intention.


**However, suddenly, the doorbell rings, interrupting the conversation and changing Miharu's mood again, who becomes alert. Satoshi gets up from his seat with great excitement and says:**


Satoshi: ""Your sister has finally arrived! It certainly took her quite a while to get here. I hope everything went well. I need to hug her, and I also want to see you two together again, I can't wait! I'll be right back, I already want to see the surprised face Sumi will make. It's a great day to be alive!""


**As Satoshi walks away toward the entrance, Miharu remains seated on the couch, looking toward the entrance, thinking about her next move. The Sakurasawa Residence will once again witness the family drama that is about to unfold inside. The third reunion has begun.**


---


**While Sumi's life continues spinning uncontrollably, violently colliding between her past and her present, elsewhere, another girl suffers immense loneliness inside her room. Ruka, lying on her bed, stares at the ceiling, drowning in a sea of doubts and memories about her relationship with Kazuya.**


Ruka (Thought): ""Two years have passed since we started dating, however, I have never been able to enter your heart, and now, that I finally had a clear path, you are no longer here... But... Why were you never able to love me? What else did I need to do? I've tried everything, and yet, nothing has worked... I always had a doubt in my mind, but I never dared to ask for fear of your answer, but... Why her? What is so special about her? What has she done to deserve your love? Why do you love her? Why, if I offer you everything, do you still choose her? Will I never be enough for you?""


**Ruka turns over, lying on her side, staring at a shelf on the wall, right where there is a collection of Shoujo manga that she loves. Fantasizing for a moment about being the protagonist, but abruptly breaking the illusion the moment Chizuru appears in her scene, stealing all the attention of her love. Back to reality, angry, she grabs a heart-shaped pillow and hugs it angrily against her chest, closes her eyes, and sighs deeply.**


**A second later, she loosens her grip, opens her eyes, and continues reflecting.**


Ruka (Thought): ""Damn it! I followed every tactic, every move, every detail on how to win over your beloved from that Shoujo manga and nothing works! I'm tired of continuing with this, haven't I done enough? Where is my reward? Or maybe, have I always done everything wrong? It's not possible, it's not true, but... for a moment I would like to recall everything. How did our relationship start? I asked him out and he refused, but in the end, I managed to convince him! As a good girlfriend, I contact him several times a day! Did I go and introduce myself as his girlfriend to his family? Fair enough, Chizuru is just a rental girlfriend, I had the right! I gave him my first kiss, I even offered him my whole body! And yet, even so, he asks me to break up to pursue an empty dream? I won't allow it! Kazuya is mine alone, destiny itself wanted it that way, we are soulmates, he is the only person who makes me feel alive, who can make me happy, and I won't let him leave my side!""


**Ruka suddenly gets up and sits on the bed, and begins to throw everything she finds near her to the other corner of her room, full of powerlessness, pain, and rage. Without the strength to do anything else, she falls face down on her bed, while remembering what Chizuru and Mini told her at the hospital.**


***Mini***: ""(...) *When do you plan to leave Kazuya alone? Don't you understand that he doesn't love you? What is this? A little girl's tantrum?""*


***Chizuru***: ""(...) *The one who manipulates Kazuya has always been you. You blackmailed him into agreeing to be your boyfriend, and when he wanted to end it peacefully, you just became more insistent (...) If you really loved him, you wouldn't force him to stay with you! The strange one here who won't let him go is you!""*


Ruka (Thought): ""Wait a second, it can't be! Damn! But how could you not realize that, you idiot? Of course, that's why! I've never let him choose, I've always tied him to my will. I keep pressuring you to do things over and over without taking your opinion into account!... Now I understand, as much as I hate to admit it, it's true, they're right about something: I've always been selfish, always thinking about my own happiness, never his... Ahhh... I've done everything wrong from the start, I should never have forced you to date me that way, I shouldn't have forced you to do anything, all that pressure, that jealousy, those advances that made you uncomfortable, everything, all wrong, Damn!... It seems like a tantrum from a child who is only interested in being bought that toy she wants, without thinking about anything else...""


**Ruka turns and is back again as in the beginning, looking at the ceiling, with a serious and remorseful look, she continues with her final reflection.**


Ruka (Thought): ""But... right now, it doesn't matter that I already know what not to do anymore, it's too late, you've already left, and maybe forever... So... what should I do now? I feel horrible, but... How do I fix things? I belittled them, insulted them, and hurt them mercilessly. Maybe I don't deserve their friendship, but at least, I should apologize to everyone and leave all this behind, and try to be someone better, someone worthy of being loved, and if Kazuya decides to come back, try to win him over, but this time, in a more natural way... Now that I think about it, I wasn't that different from Mami, huh?... By the way, that reminds me that she used me as a disposable piece in her attack on Chizuru... Wait a minute, that's it! Ruka Sarashina is back! Renewed and ready for the fight, Mami is going to pay for everything. Now, I will ask Kuri for Mini's cell phone, I already know what I must do.""


**Life is a constantly changing journey, sometimes you can be at the top touching the sky and other times feel the heat of hell itself burning under your feet. The freedom to choose a path to follow, change direction, go back, fall, get up, run or walk, is what makes each person unique. Everything begins to change, the balance of power begins to tip to the other side, however, nothing is free and the price to pay is still uncertain.**


---


Uff... This chapter has been the longest I have written so far, and one of the most difficult to make, but I am satisfied. Every detail is there, I think I managed to tell everything I wanted. Each reunion had to be special in its own way, and Ruka's reflection had to be powerful and complete. For now, this has been all for today. I apologize for taking so long to update; I was busy and the chapter was more complicated to write than I expected. I hope not to take too long again. The final stretch towards the resolution of the lie begins, Mami's downfall is about to arrive.


*What did you think of the chapter?*


*What did you think of each reunion?*


*Do you think Ruka's change is real?*


**Comment and vote, that helps me know if you like it. I will be reading the comments. That's all for this time, see you next chapter. Thank you for reading my story!**

US$1.30 monthly for an AI coding agent. That's less than a coffee. I had to read it twice.  
Month one is $1.30. After that it’s \~¥40/month (\~$5–$6). I’m paying $20 for ChatGPT/Claude today. Copilot runs \~$10–$19.  
We're all remember when in Jan, 2025 DeepSeek shocked the world with crushed token costs. Taken all allegation and controversy aside, the price point was revolutionary. And now we have AI coding agents at $1.30/month.  
Chinese technology keep delivering the same capabilities at a fraction of Western prices.

Even though, many will argue that it isn’t as good as GPT or Claude, but for many use cases “good enough” is perfectly fine. I definitely will give it a try in my vibe coding in the coming days.

I'm curious, would you still pay $20 when $6 gets you “good enough”?",1,1762984801.0,vibecoding,0,1.0,False

She’s labeled as a border collie, which is pretty obvious. But bear with me here - as a collie person, I don’t think she is 100% (or even 50%) collie. 

1. Her gait is that of a deer. She doesn’t have the herding trot in the slightest. She’s FAST, but more bounds and bounces than anything. 
2. She is CONFIDENT. If you know collies, you know they’re the most awkward, anxious beings on earth. She is happy, social, runs headfirst (literally, she bonks her head on everything from excitement) into everything, has no hesitations on anything.
3. No impulse control and zero self-preservation. She climbs like a malinois. She jumps on my coffee, jumps on top of the crates, jumps straight up, you get the point. Her brain gets into go mode and no obstacle will stop her. Reminds me of a dutch or a mal. 
4. Honestly, not all that herdy. She doesn’t fixate, doesn’t track. If she wants something she just pursues. 
5. Look at her body! Am I crazy or is that a mal/dutchy body????

To be fair, I pulled her from a southern shelter. She’s only a year and likely has never had any proper stimulation or training. She’s been up less than a week so all this craziness could just be shelter shock. I am head over heels for her and am debating on a DNA test just for her LOL. Thoughts?

I stumbled upon a business idea and would love to get your honest opinion as hosts.

The Concept: A company would send hosts free ""curated boxes"" containing a selection of high-quality products (e.g., specialty coffee, nice bathroom essentials from a cool brand, local snacks, small decorative items, etc.).
In exchange, you would feature these products in your listings to enhance the guest experience.
=> Why is it free? Because brands would pay to promote their products.

The benefits for you would be:
Offering a ""premium"" experience to your guests at no cost.
Potentially getting better reviews and more bookings.
Discovering and sharing new products with your guests.

My questions for you:
 1. Would this service interest you? Why or why not?
 2. What are your biggest concerns? (e.g., getting cheap/low-quality products, dealing with deliveries, making the listing feel too much like an ""ad""...)
 3. What type of products would you truly love to receive for your guests?

Snack - cornflakes, soya milk with yogurt and fruit 10/10

A good and busy day, shopping and tidying. I did reschedule my appointment which dad is still annoyed about. Being 100% transparent I rescheduled because I know this past week hasn't been great and I suspect I have either stayed the same or lost weight because my MASSIVE increase in activity and food hasn't been amazing, although I still ate pretty good. Also going every week is intense, I just wanted a week to adjust to work, a new routine etc without the threat of having it all taken away! 

Food obsession is VERY intense atm, planning what to eat all the flipping time! I also had a lot of noise around body image - my brain telling me now I have gained weight and I can't possibly increase my energy ugh so exhausting. Still battling DAILY with the fact my energy target is too high, so have yet to meet it. I know the day I do will be monumental in my recovery. I keep getting annoyed I haven't even really got that close to it yet but at least I am getting closer and snacks are back, fear foods have been added etc. I just frigging hate all the battles I have in my mind 24/7 that I am eating too much sugar, too much energy, move EVEN more, cut the processed foods, stop the desserts, you are gorging. It is all so intense at times. Particularly as I am challenging myself and eating 'unhealthy' foods quite a lot and a lot of carbs, fat and sugar, but trying to remind myself its what my body needs!

After this day though, leaving so many ‘treats’ until the end of the night has left me feeling very full and guilty. I was hungry this morning but was out and didn’t have lunch until late.

1ovim9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tawanamohammadi/comments/1ovim9u/image_generation_with_gemini_aka_nano_banana/,🧠 Image Generation with Gemini (aka Nano Banana),"

Gemini (also known as **Nano Banana**) can **generate and process images conversationally**. You can prompt it with **text, images, or both**, allowing you to create, edit, and iterate on visuals with unprecedented control.

# ✨ Key Capabilities

* **Text-to-Image:** Generate high-quality images from simple or complex text descriptions.
* **Image + Text-to-Image (Editing):** Provide an image and use text prompts to add, remove, or modify elements, change the style, or adjust the color grading.
* **Multi-Image to Image (Composition & Style Transfer):** Use multiple input images to compose a new scene or transfer the style from one image to another.
* **Iterative Refinement:** Engage in a conversation to progressively refine your image over multiple turns.
* **High-Fidelity Text Rendering:** Generate images with legible and well-placed text—ideal for logos, diagrams, and posters.

All generated images include a [SynthID watermark](https://ai.google.dev/responsible/docs/safeguards/synthid) for traceability.

# 🖼️ Image Generation (Text-to-Image)

Below is an example of generating an image using Gemini 2.5 Flash Image.

# Python Example

    from google import genai
    from google.genai import types
    from PIL import Image
    
    client = genai.Client()
    
    prompt = ""Create a picture of a nano banana dish in a fancy restaurant with a Gemini theme""
    
    response = client.models.generate_content(
        model=""gemini-2.5-flash-image"",
        contents=[prompt],
    )
    
    for part in response.parts:
        if part.text is not None:
            print(part.text)
        elif part.inline_data is not None:
            image = part.as_image()
            image.save(""generated_image.png"")

*AI-generated image of a nano banana dish in a Gemini-themed restaurant.*

# 🧩 Image Editing (Text-and-Image-to-Image)

**Note:** Ensure you have rights to any images you upload. Avoid generating content that infringes on others' rights. Refer to Google’s [Prohibited Use Policy](https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy).

    from google import genai
    from google.genai import types
    from PIL import Image
    
    client = genai.Client()
    
    prompt = ""Create a picture of my cat eating a nano-banana in a fancy restaurant under the Gemini constellation""
    image = Image.open(""/path/to/cat_image.png"")
    
    response = client.models.generate_content(
        model=""gemini-2.5-flash-image"",
        contents=[prompt, image],
    )
    
    for part in response.parts:
        if part.text is not None:
            print(part.text)
        elif part.inline_data is not None:
            image = part.as_image()
            image.save(""edited_cat_image.png"")

*AI-generated image of a cat eating a nano banana under the Gemini constellation.*

# 🪄 Other Image Generation Modes

Gemini supports multiple modes based on your prompt context:

* **Text → Image(s) + Text:** Combine visual and textual outputs.
* **Image(s) + Text → Image(s) + Text:** Use input visuals to produce new images with descriptive text.
* **Multi-turn Editing (Chat):** Conversational refinement of visuals across iterations.

Example:

# 🧭 Prompting Guide and Strategies

>

# 1. Photorealistic Scenes

Use camera terms—angles, lenses, and lighting.

    prompt = ""A photorealistic close-up portrait of an elderly Japanese ceramicist with deep wrinkles, smiling as he inspects a tea bowl in warm sunlight.""

*Example of a photorealistic close-up portrait.*

# 2. Stylized Illustrations & Stickers

Create icons, logos, or kawaii-style assets.

    prompt = ""A kawaii-style sticker of a happy red panda eating bamboo, vibrant colors, white background.""

*A kawaii-style red panda sticker with a transparent background.*

# 3. Product Mockups

Ideal for e-commerce and branding.

    prompt = ""A high-resolution product photo of a matte black coffee mug on a marble table with soft lighting.""

*A minimalist product mockup for commercial use.*

# 4. Minimalist Design

Perfect for backgrounds or marketing visuals.

*A minimalist composition with negative space.*

# 5. Sequential Art (Comics & Storyboards)

Build consistent character-driven visuals.

*A single comic book panel in a gritty noir style.*

# 🧠 Best Practices

* **Be Hyper-Specific:** Detail every element, texture, or mood.
* **Provide Context:** Explain the *purpose* (logo, ad, mood board, etc.).
* **Iterate and Refine:** Adjust lighting, perspective, or tone conversationally.
* **Use Positive Prompts:** Say what you *want*, not what you *don’t want*.
* **Control the Camera:** Use cinematic phrasing like “wide-angle” or “macro close-up.”

# ⚙️ Optional Configurations

You can configure output modality and image aspect ratio via the `config` parameter.

With that in mind, I doubled the amount of the grapefruit syrup and reduced the glaze a little bit. 

I was right to be concerned by the grapefruit flavour, I think so much of the flavour is in the zest so it didn't have that big citrus punch that I was looking for, it was more of a subtle flavour.

M28 here. December is stacked with events/parties where I’ll run into a lot of people from my network. I’m not looking to date right now, but I do want to show up socially calibrated and high-energy — and I’m considering hiring a professional wingwoman (think: social co-host / event companion), not an escort, strictly platonic.

The idea: someone socially savvy who helps with intros, keeps conversations flowing, and adds a bit of status/social proof — ideally also opening doors to meet new people (women included) in a natural, respectful way.

If you’ve done this (or staffed it), I’d love advice on:
	1.	Where to find candidates (non-escort):
What keywords/roles should I search for? “Wingwoman,” “event hostess,” “brand ambassador,” “social coordinator,” “professional plus-one,” “platonic companion”? Agencies vs. independent?
	2.	Vetting & fit:
How do you screen for social intelligence, reliability, and discretion? Any red flags? Would you do a short coffee mock-run to see chemistry and banter?
	3.	Boundaries & optics (super important):
I’d set this as platonic, no PDA, clear NDA/confidentiality, and no misrepresenting her as my girlfriend unless mutually agreed as a simple “plus-one” label. Anything else I should spell out up front?
	4.	Game plan / process:
	•	Pre-event brief (guest list, goals, key people to meet).
	•	Roles: who opens, who closes, how we hand off conversations, rescue signals, time-boxing chats.
	•	Arrival/exit choreography (so it doesn’t feel staged).
	•	After-action debrief to improve for the next event.
	5.	Budgeting:
What’s a fair structure? Hourly + event rate? Wardrobe stipend? Travel/ride-share covered? Tip? Curious what people have paid/charged for 3–5 hour evening events.
	6.	Ethics & authenticity:
Any ways this can backfire or feel disingenuous? Tips to keep it classy, respectful, and genuinely value-adding for everyone at the event?
	7.	Alternatives:
Would you instead bring a well-connected friend, hire a social coach for a few sessions, or go solo and focus on your own approach?

In an age dominated by algorithms, automation, and impersonal transactions, the art of genuine human connection stands out as a rare and powerful differentiator — especially in the world of *luxury vacation rentals USA*. For many hosts on [**Llivo**](https://www.llivo.com/), hospitality isn’t just about offering a space to sleep; it’s about *creating moments that turn travelers into lifelong friends*.

From greeting your guests at the door to sharing a local meal or offering an airport pickup, every interaction carries the potential to create a bond that transcends business. This is what Llivo represents — the *human side of hosting*, where travel becomes more than a service and evolves into a shared story.

In this blog, we’ll explore how you can cultivate authentic relationships with guests, why these friendships matter for long-term success, and how Llivo’s mission is redefining short-term rentals with *heart and humanity* at the center.



https://preview.redd.it/i7k73cuaaw0g1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=51b50ead43f7ac947942ae5728387055222823bd

# Understanding the Power of Human Connection

When travelers book through a *vacation rental agency in the USA*, they aren’t just buying accommodation; they’re investing in an experience. Guests remember the **warm welcome**, **honest conversation**, or **small acts of kindness** long after checkout.

Studies show that 86% of travelers value human interaction over digital convenience when choosing where to stay. A simple moment of empathy — helping a tired guest find their way from the airport or sharing a local story — can transform a routine stay into a heartfelt memory.

And when your guests leave with that emotional connection, they’re not just leaving reviews — they’re becoming **ambassadors for your property and your brand**.



# Why Guest Friendships Matter for Hosts 

Becoming friends with your guests isn’t about breaking boundaries; it’s about **building trust, comfort, and loyalty**. Here’s why it matters:

# 1. Stronger Reviews and Referrals

When guests feel a genuine bond, they leave reviews that radiate sincerity — not just ratings, but stories. A single heartfelt testimonial can attract dozens of new bookings.

# 2. Higher Retention and Repeat Stays

A guest who feels cared for returns — often bringing friends or family. That’s sustainable business growth without extra marketing costs.

# 3. Word-of-Mouth Marketing

Nothing beats authentic advocacy. Guests who become friends often share their experiences online, tag your property, and organically expand your visibility.

# 4. Emotional Fulfillment

Hosting is about *people*. The gratitude, the shared stories, and the cross-cultural exchange enrich your life beyond financial returns — the very spirit of Llivo’s global mission.



# How to Turn Guests into Friends — Without Overstepping Boundaries 

While warmth and openness matter, professionalism must always guide the relationship. Here’s how to strike the perfect balance:

# 1. Start with Genuine Hospitality

Simple gestures — a handwritten welcome note, a personalized greeting, or offering a cup of tea upon arrival — go a long way. It shows your guest they’re seen, not just booked.

#  2. Offer Thoughtful Services

At Llivo, hosts often enhance the guest experience through optional services like [airport pickup and drop-off](https://www.llivo.com/p/boost-occupancy-rate) — thoughtful touches that make guests feel genuinely cared for from the moment they land.  
 **3. Share Local Knowledge Authentically**

Skip the brochure talk. Instead, recommend your favorite coffee spot, the best sunset view, or a local tradition that means something to you. You’re not a concierge — you’re a *connector*.

#  4. Stay Connected After Checkout

Send a thank-you message, invite them to stay again, or simply wish them well on their next journey. Building friendship doesn’t end at checkout — it evolves through care and continued connection.

#  5. Listen and Learn

Great hosts are great listeners. Let your guests share their stories, cultures, and dreams. Many Llivo hosts describe how those exchanges have led to lifelong friendships that transcend geography and culture.



# Real-World Example: When Hospitality Becomes Heart

A Llivo host in Austin, Texas, shared a simple yet touching story. One evening, she invited her guests — a young couple from Spain — to join her family for a barbecue. They shared music, laughter, and stories about their hometowns. Months later, they returned — not as guests, but as friends.

This is the *Llivo difference*: creating a space where travel becomes connection, and where every journey is an opportunity to celebrate our shared humanity.



# Building the Llivo Way of Hosting 

Llivo was founded on a simple belief — that travel should bring people together, not just transport them from one place to another. Through its platform, [**Llivo**](https://www.llivo.com/p/about) empowers hosts to express the soul of hospitality by offering comfort, care, and community.

By merging services like transport, communication, and cultural experiences, Llivo enables hosts to offer **personalized stays that feel like friendship**. That’s how a guest becomes more than a transaction — they become part of your journey.

# Final Words

In a world where so many experiences feel transactional, being the host who *truly connects* can make all the difference. When a guest becomes a friend, you’re no longer just renting space — you’re creating meaning.

As Llivo continues to grow as the **best short-term vacation rental agency in the USA**, it carries this timeless truth: *the most memorable journeys are those shared between hearts, not just homes*.

I worked here for a year and a half and I genuinely love my coworkers and my job but my boss is a problem. I was supposed to work for the summer and I was working through an intense trauma and had to go home (from school) for my own safety after a suicide attempt at the beginning of the summer. So I didn’t end up working there that summer but got asked to come back at the beginning of the school year. This whole year my boss has been making jokes about what happened to me over the summer, but today it went to far. He called my coworker a brat (jokingly) so I jokingly asked if he thought I was a brat. He said yes, because of what happened over the summer and he explained to my coworkers that I was supposed to work all summer but I attempted suicide and had to go to the hospital and then go home. I guess in his mind that makes me a brat and is appropriate to say in front of my coworkers.

She was away a lot and we saw each other less often, but the connection between us was intense. We texted and talked on the phone every day and made plans for trips. I was very fond of her, the conversations were great, and I thought I had finally found someone with whom I could have a relationship on equal terms. I was in love i guess. When she spontaneously went to a festival with some old friends of mine, I got scared that they would tell her about my past. When she came back, I was upset and told her everything. A few days later, she became distant and ended everything. She didn't want to give me a second chance. From that moment on, we had sporadic contact and met for coffee. After that, I asked her if there could be more for her, as I still had strong feelings for her. She said she wanted to try friendship for now. It was a big misunderstanding at the time, but she closed herself off very quickly and became cold, which is why I think she is an avoidant. We haven't had any contact for 20 days.

I’d make rules, delete the vape app, throw out lighters. By lunch I was bargaining.

Every relapse felt like proof I was weak.  
I kept changing tactics, but not the person using them.

The shift was simple and weirdly practical - I stopped “trying to quit” and started acting as a non-smoker who protects their oxygen. Not future me, not Monday me. Me, right now.

A non-smoker doesn’t need perfect willpower.  
They need a small plan that removes choices when cravings hit.  
So I built a plan that forced my identity first, tools second.

Here’s the system I test every day:

* Two scripts on my lock screen - one for the morning spike, one for the 3pm dip
* A 15 minute walk or shower as the first response, not a thought battle
* Nicotine math log - tally urges resisted today, not “days clean”
* A simple pact with one person - send “crave” and get a prewritten reply
* If I slip, I restart in the next breath - zero story, zero drama

The scripts are short.  
Morning: drink water, breathe for 60 seconds, walk or shower, eat something with protein, change the room.  
Afternoon: step away for two minutes, chew gum, quick stretching, text the pact person, do one tiny task.

I taped the identity into everything.  
My phone says “you’re a non-smoker - protect oxygen.”  
My calendar label for commutes says “clean lungs ride.”  
My coffee mug says “not today.” Silly works.

Within a week, the air felt brighter on my first walk, and the quiet after dinner didn’t scare me anymore.  
Urges came, but each time I followed the script, I trusted myself more.

This isn’t about being tough. It’s about being specific.  
Make your scripts visible. Preload the steps. Tell one person the pact.  
If a step doesn’t get used twice, cut it. If a step saves you once, honor it.

I wrote about identity-first rules that actually get used in [NoFluffWisdom](https://NoFluffWisdom.com/subscribe), and the core idea holds here too - the plan only works when it fits the person you choose to be.

If you’re stuck in the quit and relapse loop, try this today.  
Don’t fight the craving as “you.”

I had been talking to a lovely boy and we decided to go on a date one Friday night. It went so well and I felt like a girl who had just seen a boy for the first time! Anyways, it went so well that I ended up spending the night. In the morning, I cooked us a bacon bap and we went for coffees. Around 2pm that day he's going to drive me home. We walk to his car and I notice him pace ahead. As we're crossing the road he just says ""hold on a sec, I feel really s*"". I didn't think much of it because feeling n* can be anything. Until he then darted across to the pavement and started tu* by a wall. I didn't know what to do with myself. I was just stood there. It was strange because I felt like I should look away but I just couldn't. Here I am post one night-stand (spoiler alert, it wasn't just a one night stand but at the time it would have been 😆) watching the guy I met for the first time
 v* a lot in the middle of a pavement. 

At first I thought, oh my god did i just poison this man with my cooking? Then realised I couldn't have as I had the same thing and was fine. Then I thought maybe it was the coffee. But again I was fine!

We walk back to his flat as he's embarrassed and I keep trying to tell him it's fine it's absolutely fine. He ends up being okay and it was just a one time thing so He said it's probably anxiety but who knows.

Anyways, we're still together now lol! Bonding I suppose 🤣 he's still embarrassed when I bring it up now! ",1,1762983517.0,emetophobia,1,1.0,False

I make a cappuccino everyday and sometimes back to back milk drinks (which yes, would be a pain).

I’m looking at machines like the breville dual boiler which pisses me off because of the plastic, but dual boiler seems amazing. Or going with a classic like ecm classica for a single boiler, or even a HX machine like the lelit Mara x.

I’ve heard hx don’t have good temp stability so I think I’m between the well made single boiler with a nice level and great steam power in the ecm, or a dual boiler machine with the breville. Both are the same price.

My one issue is brevilles longevity, and also I heard of an issue of plastic bubbling beneath the shower screen? I’d rather not have that in my cup of coffee if possible. And then my own issue with the ecm is the single boiler nature of it all. But the look and and the lever action seems very nice. Would love some insight into this price range of machines!

A friend already here, who has caused some problems for our group, seems to be leeching on to him and it's making me feel bypassed and weird.","Hey all,

I have a group of friends in a city. 1 of them (husband's friend, really) is not much of a great friend to us - call him Ted. Ted creates a some problems by.. spilling beans on things he's not supposed to, acting a bit selfishly, etc. For instance, deciding to drive himself somewhere then texting everyone that he feels left out of the carpool (?). It's like this every week, and I feel like I do a lot ""emotional management"" for this person.

My best friend just moved here from Denver, largely for me and for life opportunities. I'm so excited to have him here - it's a 25 year friendship, since 4th grade. The ""problem-friend"" and my best friend didn't know each other previously, and they have no history.

Ted has kind of.. ""leeched"" onto my best friend in what feels like atypical way. He just kind of ""decided"" he like him. While I've never been asked to coffee or happy hour directly by Ted, he's invited my best friend (one-on-one) biweekly at this point to these activities. My best friend is a very nice guy, and says yes to everything.

Something about this feels like a social faux paux. To have my best friend move here, to then get bombarded randomly with invites and plans from this problem-friend is a bit jarring. It's as if the problem-friend just kind of decided to bypass me, and it's becoming a little strange to keep hearing from my best friend that problem-friend invited them to do X and that they're doing it. Problem-friend has also given out invites that were not his to give (ie., plans my husband and I set up).

I've alluded to my best friend that the problem-friend has caused issues for us and our group, without directly talking smack on the problem-friend.

I completely understand that two adults can hang out without my permission. My goal in this is not to be included in these plans. I think my best friend doesn't really know the depths of problems that Ted creates due to his selfishness.

I would never do this to someone else, which makes me feel like something here is wrong. My husband and I are deciding if anything should be verbalized. Talk to my best friend? My husband talking to his friend about how it's coming off? We really don't want to ruin any friendships, but this social faux paux is upsetting us.

I want to have kids with you and struggle through sleepless nights together
I want you to be the person that I look at when our kid does something cute and we go *crazy eyes* and *awwww*
I want you to be my teammate in anything in life from suffering through the flu together to surviving life-altering changes
I want us to have more family pets and am looking forward to our dog being our kids’ first family pet 
I want us to build a home that feels like us,  filled with lots of soft light, plants you’ll, as always, be taking care of and I’ll be buying because I love them, trinkets and memorabilia because we’re both sappy, and the smell of coffee you drink and your cooking, maybe my occasional baking, but mostly your cooking (we essentially already have this lol)
I want weekend chaos together with our family: grocery runs, cleaning music, burnt pancakes because you and I and our kids were distracted, and lazy naps tangled under blankets while there’s some stupid cartoon playing on the tv for the millionth time to keep everyone calm
I want us to make traditions — movie nights, inside jokes, holiday rituals that are ours alone, built on the ones we already have and be festive in our happiness
I want to travel with you. First to show you where I have lived and what has made me — me, but then to show our kids the world, to eat questionable street food and laugh about it later, to argue over maps in foreign cities, and always find our way back to each other
I want to watch you age with me, not the way we have aged in the last 6 months lol, but with hair turning grey, eyes softening, hands still looking for each other
I want to build a life that’s not about perfection but about persistence and presence — us choosing each other, again and again, no matter what’s going on outside our four walls

But I also need you to understand something. I don’t want any of that family, that life, with the version of you who hides away from me or lets fear make decisions, and the version of me that explodes and let’s her anxiety take control and doubt everything. I want it with the man who faces himself honestly, who takes ownership, who chooses courage over comfort. The man who fights for the life we promised each other, who keeps showing up when it’s hard, who leads with love instead of guilt. And I’ll be a worthy woman for that man. Be the voice of reason and passionate supporter no matter what we’re going through. 

That’s the future I want. Not the fairytale fake one, but the real, brutally honest one. Messy, loud, full of effort and forgiveness and laughter. Because even after everything, laughing with you is my absolute favorite thing and you’re still the person I want beside me in every version of “home” because you are home

Ochaco was supposed to be studying, but her eyes kept drifting over her open laptop and settling on Izuku Midoriya. God, he was so cute, wiping down tables with that serious little frown...

The bell above the door chimed, and Mei Hatsume walked in. Hatsume was a third-year engineering genius, incredibly intense, but today she just looked tired. Her t-shirt was stretched tight over the pronounced swell of her pregnant belly. Full-on, late-term pregnant.

Mei bypassed the line, heading right for Midoriya. ""Hey, are you ready?""

Izuku's face lit up with a smile ""Oh, yeah, I'm just finishing up. What time was your appointment?""

""I'm seeing the obstetrician at 3,"" Mei said, her hand resting on the curve of her stomach. ""Can you go in with me?""

""Yeah, of course,"" Izuku said immediately, already untying his apron. ""Don't worry, I wouldn't make you do this alone.""

He hung it up, and as they walked to the door, he placed his hand on the small of her back to guide her. A casual act that felt like a punch to Ochaco.

They left. The bell chimed.

Ochaco sat frozen, the world gone silent except for the the single word replaying in her head. Obstetrician.

She had been sitting here for months, nursing this pathetic, high-school level crush, while he was out here building a goddamn family.

Shame flooded her cheeks, she felt like the biggest idiot in the city. Without a second thought, she shoved her stuff into her bag and practically fled the coffee shop, desperate for fresh air.

My parents are not inherently good people, but my mom has made more of an effort to change and be a better parent.

My dad, on the other hand, has been very emotionally and mentally,  manipulative, and abusive. And used to be physically abusive to hes an alcoholic and irresponsible.

Long story short, he's not a good person. It'll be too long to go into all the details. But he really wasn't. 

My breaking point was when i tried to plan something for his birthday, he shut down all my plans, then made plans and cancelled them and made them again only to cancel again the day before and said he didn't want to do anything. Which was sad but whatever. The day of his birthday my co-workers wanted to go for a drink i agreed, telling my dad that i would come and give him his presents and then go home and change and go out with my co-workers (this was important for me because i lost a lot of my friendships due to working so much and having poor health and this was invite only so it was the first hang out id had outside of my family and bf almost 3 years!)

This was before work, i work where he lives (he lives in an unsupported living complex at a franchise hostel and i work in the supported living which is next door with joint carparks) so i saw him in the morning before work to have a coffee with him. Later that day, i heard him in the car park talking to his mom about how I'm going out that evening, and he couldn't believe i would do this to him on his birthday. I don't know what else he said, but it must have been bad.

Because the outing was cancelled so i told my dad i can stay at his longer (original plan was to be at his from 1-6) and said i will meet my sister get some food and bring her down to his and i can stay till whenever. But whatever he said to his mom made his mom (70f) and his 2 sisters (45f and 39f) ignore both me and my sister. Wouldn't talk to us. Wouldn't look at us, made plans without us, and wouldn't even hug us goodbye. That was my last straw. I told them i couldn't do it anymore and wanted space for a bit, which earned me paragraphs of abuse from his sisters.

Then my dad tried to get me fired from my job the next day. It didn't work, but he was advised to by his sister. And he did try it. Thats when i told them I was done completely and was cutting contact. 

I know what i did was right for me. I know he was the cause for a lot of my mental health and a lot of mine and my sibling's trauma.

But despite all this. Going to my cousins wedding. And seeing her walk down the aisle with her dad and hearing the speeches and stuff. Broke me a little inside because if i ever get married, i won't have that. I won't have my dad, I won't have my aunts uncles and cousins from his side like i had always imagined. And for a moment, I started to wonder if i had made a mistake. I know i haven't. I know he was bad for me and my well-being. And nothing will ever truly convice me otherwise. But it's really lingered with me, and it's been a month now, but every time I hear about him, it reassures that i made the right choice. 

**TL:DR;** My dad is a bad guy. I cut contact with him and his family. But seeing what i was going to miss out on at the wedding broke my heart a little, and i can't stop thinking about it even though i know i made the right choice. ",1,1762982581.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

When Jordan and I returned to *Charity Station*, it was to cheers from everybody. Even when we left Eucleia to head back to Philophrosyne, the civilians were cheering when they saw us. The debriefing taking a full quarter claw meant that they knew everything by the time we were wandering around.

That’s how we found ourselves in this bar, surrounded almost entirely by station staff, mostly Terrans; members of the Space Corps; some Terrans without their partners; and a pawful of people visiting with their partners. Joyful, Terran music playing louder than any Federation bar would allow. And the drinks! Who would have thought that Terrans had sensible alcohol tolerances? Instead of the flamer fuel that the Venlil call alcohol, I’m sipping on the tastiest ale I’ve ever had. Not only did I not need to pay, since the Terrans insist on fully subsidizing us while we’re here, but if I can call in even half the drink offers in the future, then I doubt I’ll be paying for a drink this rotation.

Louli, forgive me, but Terran food might be better than most things from home if their alcohol is anything to go by.

“So this is a sa-zon?” I ask, sipping the amber liquid. Chilled but not cold. Fruity with hints of citrus, a bit of spice that I can’t place because I don’t know Terran cooking well enough (yet), and earthy notes. Crisp from the bubbles and dry enough to leave me eager for more.

“Saizon,” Jordan corrects with a chuckle.

I roll the sounds around in my head before trying again. “Say-zaan?”

“Exactly! Oh, the falafel are here.” Jordan says happily as our waitress puts a plate between us.

“Ooo, you said these are good. You haven’t led me wrong yet!” I take one of the crispy brown spheres drizzled with a light brown sauce. The crust breaks under my teeth, crisp and both present and barely there despite the crumbly texture that lingers. The insides are light and fluffy. It tastes earthy, warm, bright, energetic, yet grounded. Spicy and… garlicky! Yes, that’s the Terran flavor, garlic! Another bite with the sauce, which contrasts in my mouth, smooth and cool to balance the way the rest feels in my mouth. The taste has lemon and garlic, tangy and slightly bitter. It all blends beautifully. I happily devour the rest before taking a pull of my saizon, the flavors meshing and cleansing my palate, leaving me eager for more of both. “Wow… Why couldn’t you lot have found us instead of the Federation?”

Jordan laughs. “We found you now.” He sighs. “I’ve talked to the contacts I have about your people being the next we reach out to. Even asked my family to do the same. Don’t expect much from it, not like a family of jarheads can have much impact on politics, even if we know some interesting people. But we shouldn’t talk about anything serious, we’re here to celebrate!” He raises his beer, calling out. “To Shila! The hero of *Charity Station* and our first Yotul gunnery ace! Ace in a day!”

The bar erupts into cheers: Terrans and Venlil, and the few other species there.

“You go, Roo!”

“You kicked their scaly tails!”

“Make a purse out of them next time!”

“Go, Shila!”

“Not bad, primitive! You’re a credit to your species!”

At that, the entire bar goes quiet, even the music gets turned off, tension fills the air as the Terrans all look at the pouch-patter. Their exchange partner grabs the Venlil and drags them out while shouting. “What the fuck is wrong with you, you racist asshole!”

“Anybody else agree with him? Door’s right there if you do!” The bartender calls out, waiting a moment. A few members of the herd, some I remember from when they’ve gotten smoked in our classes, pull in on themselves, but nobody says a word. The bartender cracks a grin, eyes lingering on a few before they continue. “No? Good! Round on the house!” They call out to cheers as the music resumes.

My tail wags. “So, Jordan, any of your… special forces people on station?” I ask, trying to keep my ears from giving away how eager I am to meet them.

“A few of my squad are here with the rest arriving on the fleet, rejected for being too much, but the station’s big and… Si vis pacem, para bellum.” Jordan shrugs.

I’m thankful that I installed the translator update the Terrans shared ages ago as the phrase translates in my brain. Instead of the pawful of Terran languages that it had, I can now understand all of them. Though there was a brief mishop where I had the Guild-approved variant instead of the direct translation codec. “Huh... He who desires old age must keep a blade ready...” I quote one of my family’s manuals.

Jordan raises an eye ridge. “What’s that from? Sounded like a quote.”

I bloom. “F-forget I said anything.” Jordan brings his fingers to his lips, dragging them across, twisting them, and miming tossing something. “What? I don’t understand what that means.”

Jordan blooms. “Oh… uh… it means my lips are sealed. Zipped technically, with the zipper broken off.”

“Ah, thanks. But about your squad? Could I meet them?” My leg bounces with excitement at the idea.

“I… don’t know about that,” Jordan says, nervous for the first time I’ve seen.

“Oh, come on.” I groan. “I don’t care if they’re predatory. You know that, Jordan.”

“It’s not that, Legs. I’m worried about getting *them* in trouble.” Jordan rubs the back of his head. “They’re not supposed to be interacting with any of you. They’re in another city. Doesn’t matter if you’d be fine with them. Orders are orders, and they aren’t illegal or dumb, so they’re being followed.” Jordan grimaces. “I mean… There have already been too many attacks, and everybody cleared for the exchange… Well… we have personalities that make us suited for it. Best foot forward and all that. There’d probably be more with a wider range of personalities. A few who’d fight back.”

I huff and throw back a clear drink that had been sent to our table earlier. Tasteless but with a strong burn, not bad. “Fine. At least try to get me cleared to meet them.”

Jordan chuckles. “Fine, fine. I’ll see what I can do.”

The waitress returns with our meals. “A hazy IPA and vegan tacos for the roo and a stout and a mushroom burger for the big man.”

My tail lashes as the waitress puts a hand on Jordan’s shoulder before walking off. I catch her looking back at him. Jordan doesn’t notice. “I’ve been dying for a good burger. Hope this’ll do.”

I tilt my head. “What? Not a normal burger?”

Jordan looks away. “Uh… no… Very much not, Legs.”

“Hmm… well, you’ll need to let me try a bite,” I say.

“Course, split? Fifty-fifty?” Jordan asks as he’s already cutting his burger.

“Sounds like a plan!” I say, happily giving Jordan two of my tacos along with some of the side they gave me, and taking half of his burger along with some of his side. I can’t help but wonder what a real burger tastes like, since apparently, vegan means no animal products, a burger must normally be something that would make the Venlil faint. Reason enough to try a bite. It’s a lot of food, but I’ll do my best before taking a sip of my new beer, a hazy IPA according to that loose-pouched waitress. It’s delicious. Fruity in ways different from the saizon that I can’t place, but making me certain to try more Terran fruits. Citrus notes. It’s like drinking an alcoholic juice. ‘I wonder what the Terrans could do with a dreipini?’

Delighted, I move on to the taco. A flat disk of strayu with heaps of cut plants and drizzles of sauce on top, piles of crisp strayu triangles to the side, along with dips for them. I pick up one of the tacos, taking an awkward bite. Sharp and electric, deep and mellow, a gentle sourness, mild sweetness, heat like kadew, a rich mellowness, and bright herbal flavors. All danced across my tongue as I luxuriated not only in the taste but in how it felt to eat. Smooth pastes, fibrous shreds, bursts of juice, and crunches. Each texture, each taste, flowing and combining. Even the strayu triangles were great, crunchy and salty on their own, but the dips were part of the meal, and the flavors and feel worked beautifully with just that.

I inhaled my tacos before moving on to the burger and its side. A disk of some sort of blackened plant with leaves and fresh disks of other plants all between strayu like a sylvana. Its side was sticks of some sort of fried plant. The strayu was a bit sweet but largely neutral, a vehicle to carry the other flavors. Rich, deep, earthy, dark flavors from the blackened plant. A mild bitterness from the leaf and a juicy sourness from the red disk, while the purplish one held a sharp, pungent flavor with a hint of spice and sweetness to counter the bitterness it held. There was some sort of sauce on the strayu that brought it all into a harmonious whole with its rich smoothness. The entire thing was soft with a slight chew and bursts of crunch, like a good sylvana even if the strayu left something to be desired. The side was crunchy and salty with an airy nothingness that made it clear in a moment that it was a vehicle for sauces like my side. I didn’t hesitate to dip one into a sauce that Jordan had put on his plate, something red that was sweet and a little sour that went perfectly with the crisp sticks.

“Hey! Get your own ketchup.” Jordan says after swallowing a mouthful of his burger.

“Nah, I like yours more,” I say with a laugh, slapping the floor with my tail. ‘I’m going to put on so much weight if I’m not careful with Terran food, but it’s so worth it.’ I think as I finish my beer and signal for another. The night is young!

‘Ugh, I’m never drinking again.’ Jordan and I overdid it last night. Not enough that we skipped our usual morning routines, just enough to feel nasty and leave blank spots in my memories. The Terran coffee is practically magic, even with the actual magic Terrans have. Jordan went off to exercise while I stayed in our assigned apartment, to do my riwi without having to talk to Jordan about Kantu. I have no idea how he’d react to the combat dance. I know what the Venlil would do, and I’d rather not risk it. I turned on the Terran music that Jordan showed me recently. Rock and roll. It didn’t quite mesh, but I still enjoyed it as I went through the movements with my eyes closed. R&B was closer to home, to the music we’d sometimes make for the dance, but this was good enough to give myself to the movements and shut off my mind. That is, until my tail brushed against something warm.

I open my eyes to see Jordan next to me, trying to mimic my stance. “Ah!” I shout and leap aside, falling into a heap.

“Oh, sorry, Legs. I didn’t mean to scare you. I forgot my phone and… well, I saw you doing kata \[err. form, meaning does not fit context\], so I figured I’d try to follow along. Maybe pick up some new moves. That was part of a martial art, right?”

“Martial art? Wait! You have combat dance?” I bound at him, just barely being caught by my human.

Jordan scrunches his face in confusion. “I mean… I guess you could call capoeira that. Probably a few others, too. I practice other martial arts, though. Mostly an old one from one of the branches of the military of my home nation.”

“Show me!” I shout, leaping at Jordan.

He laughs. “Easy, Legs. How about this, you come with me and we spar a little? Uh, did tha-”

“Yes! It’s been *years* since I’ve been able to spar!”

I’m bouncing with excitement and nervous energy as we approach the exercise center set aside for Terran soldiers, though I see what looks like a few civilians, too. I get plenty of weird looks, but don’t pay them any mind. We move past Terrans doing all sorts of things that I plan to try, all obviously different exercises. I’ve been making do with what I can do with just my body and moving cargo like I’ve been assigned for years. Soon, we come to an area where Terrans are striking hanging bags with their hands and feet and more, grabbing at each other and bringing their opponent to the ground in a grapple, even striking at each other, though only hitting pads either on the target’s paws or held in them. I can’t help but pay a bit more attention to the few Terrans with supportive tails, taking mental notes. At the center is an elevated square with ropes connected to posts at the corners. Nobody is in it, but it seems to hold a place of honor. Like a sparring ring. There’s an added spring to my step as I realize he’s brought me to a training hall!

A Terran is about to talk to Jordan when I excitedly ask as I point at the square. “Is that where we’ll get to spar?”

“Yup, gotta get you some gear before that. Safety first.” Jordan pauses. “Uh… How does your combat dance work? What do you do for it?”

“Kantu? It’s mostly kicks.” I demonstrate. Chambering a leg before kicking out ahead, my tail balancing me so that my legs can’t be swept out from under me. Before I know it, I’m sparring with Ralchi. Kicks, sweeps, dodges, blocks. Not a single thought, just raw instinct and training.

When I come back to myself, panting and flapping my ears to cool off, the silence around erupts into cheers.

“That was amazing!”

“Damn, who’d think a Fed can fight?”

“Why couldn’t we have found them first?”

“No wonder she kicked Arxur ass!”

“What was that? Savate?”

“No! It looked like capoeira!”

“That had to be based on taekkyon!”

“No! Savate!”

“The fuck would a Fed learn savate? Plus, their tail just worked with it! Hey! Do your people fight?”

“Hey, Roo! That something from your people?”

“Can you teach me? I think I have the tail for it!”

“Do some more!”

“Whoa, whoa! Everybody chill!” Jordan shouts. “Give her some space! Shila and I came here to spar. You can ask her stuff after if she’s up for it. Ok? Now, can somebody help her gear up while I’m getting mine on?”

The Terrans help me to get into what Jordan called safety gear. The soft helmet is awkward, but better than the gloves, thanks to how different my paws are from a Terran’s hands. Thankfully, some Terrans have similar legs to mine, so the foot and leg guards fit ok. One even shared files for some of the gear so I can have my own printed! I immediately schedule an appointment to get measured later. “I’m definitely going to need some of this stuff made for me. Hope they can have it ready for tomorrow.”

Jordan laughs. It sounds weird, and I notice there’s some colored thing over his teeth. ‘Oh! Dad had mentioned that some Kantu practitioners broke or lost teeth in spars and fights! It must be for that! I should get one.’ He takes a ready stance. Legs spaced shoulder width, knees slightly bent, one foot slightly behind, putting his body at an angle, arms up with hands even in front of his face. Good. Odd but good.

I take mine. Tail low, legs ready to push in any direction, arms up with one paw leading to help gauge distance. We start to circle. Slow, easy. I try not to let the music in the room decide my rhythm as I bob; better not to let them sync up, not give Jordan an easy way to feel the rhythm without following mine. The herd doesn’t matter; cheering, silent, they’re both the same. Irrelevant. He’s about to dart in for a strike, his feet shift, eyes glance past my guard. I chamber a leg, and he eases off. Not so fast! I let the energy shift to leap forward. In range. Lead leg and tail steady, trailing leg scything across before chambering and… he’s expecting it, he’ll block and counterstrike, one arm moving to block and the other readying a paw jab. I shift to the side and in, he won’t get his guard back in time. Jordan doesn’t have time to stop his paw before my tail is hooked around his leg and pulling hard with my entire body. It won’t be enough. He shifts his weight to counter my tail. One leg lashes out at his other ankle as I push off the ground to ride him to the ground with my knee at his neck.

He pats the ground three times. A surrender signal? I back off, and we reset. He pops out the tooth guard to talk. “Damn, Legs, how’d you do that? Felt like fighting a damn seer.”

“You’re just easy to read. Aren’t predator soldiers supposed to be tough?” I flick my ears teasingly. “I’m just a little prey, and I beat a member of predator special operations.”

“That so?” Jordan rolls his shoulders and tilts his head to either side, making an audible pop.

“Thought it was just having the same sparring partners back home. Guess I’m just good at reading people. Makes it easy to know what’s about to happen.”

“Time to get serious then!” Jordan laughs as the herd boos and cheers, popping the tooth guard back in. He takes a stance and turns a hand up, curling his fingers in twice. I realize he’s telling me to start. That’s a mistake. I build up a rhythm and leap in. Leg chambered for a jab at his gut. No, he’ll raise his knee to block. I switch it to an axe kick to slam down on his other leg, less power, but his foot is already off the ground and…. The other leg’s not there, there’s no knee block. He shifted while off balance. No time to take advantage of it. His paw is coming for my face. I don’t have time to fully dodge or block, taking a glancing hit to my muzzle. Jordan’s eyes light up. Joy at landing a hit? Understanding? Doesn’t matter. He just got lucky.

A right paw scythe? His body was twisting. No, a left paw jab? His guard is down, the paw chambered. A left scythe kick? His footpaw is twisting up. The right paw scythe rocks my head, sending me reeling back, even if it was weaker than he should be capable of. The fire in my soul rages. My heart pounding to my beat. I haven’t had a fight like this since long before my Running Day. I got too good at reading my family in a spar.

No matter. Ralchi guides my feet. A scythe kick to the legs. A flurry of straights for his gut, his chest, his arms, his knees. A spear kick towards the head. Each a glancing blow, Jordan not reacting until the last moment. I can’t adjust if I don’t know what he’s going to do! I just keep pressure and keep pushing him towards my rhythm. I expected better, but then again, until I moved to Venlil Prime, I lived Kantu. It makes sense that I can outfight even an elite “predator” warrior. I miss the jangle of my anklets, but just as I couldn’t wear them outside of home, I had to hide them. Maybe I could here.

I back off, seeing that Jordan and I are both moving to my rhythm. In the moment I give him, he calls something out. I can’t understand, but the response from the crowd makes it clear it wasn’t for me. It doesn’t matter. I’m guiding the fight. I’m setting the beat, he’s dancing to my step.

[The music shifts](https://youtu.be/7zp1TbLFPp8?t=36), a heart’s stomp like the foundation of a solar dance, the only thing missing is the patter. A Terran voice speaking before one calls out as a patter begins. My heart soars, and I lose myself to the dance. I don’t need to think, I’ve already won. Jordan can’t keep up with me. Words leap in, a different language from Jordan’s.

“♫¡La mano arriba, cintura sola! ¡Da media vuelta, danza kuduro!♫”

A leaping scythe kick. Jordan ducks, and I slip his attempt to grab.

“♫¡No te canse’ ahora, que esto solo empieza! ¡Mueva la cabeza, danza kuduro!♫”

I duck his hand’s jab, and he catches my knee with his, shoving it aside.

“♫¡La mano arriba, cintura sola! ¡Dae media vuelta, danza kuduro!♫”

I sweep his legs, but he stands firm. I dodge the hammerblow of his fist, leaping with my tail and legs.

“♫¡No te canse’ ahora, que esto solo empieza! ¡Mueva la cabeza, danza kuduro!♫”

A graze, the fight’s still mine.

“♫¿Quién puede domar la fuerza del mar que se mete por tus vena’? (¡Don!)♫”

Another flurry of kicks. Each absorbed into Jordan’s body.

“♫Lo caliente del sol qu se te metió y no te deja quieta, nena. (¡Toma, toma!)♫”

A counter? What? Jab. I dodge into his kick.

“♫¿Quién puede parar eso que al bailar descontrola tus cadera? (Sexy)♫”

Spear kick, graze.

“♫Y ese fuego que quema por dentro y lento te convierte en fiera. (¡Rha!)♫”

Scythe kick, caught on his knee.

“♫¡Con la mano arriba, cintura sola! ¡Da media vuelta y sacude duro!♫”

A punch? No. Swept. Turn it into a roll.

“♫¡No te quite’ ahora, que esto solo empieza! ¡Mueve la cabeza y sacude duro (¡Don!)♫”

I leap up, blocking as Jordan jabs with his paw.

“♫Mexe kuduro. Balança que é uma loucura. Morena, vem a meu lado. Ninguém vai ficar parado.♫”

He has me grabbed. I can’t see a way out.

“♫Quero ver mexer kuduro. Balança que é uma loucura. Morena, vem a meu lado. Ninguém vai ficar parado, oh.♫”

Grounded, barely dodging paws and elbows. Pinned.

“♫Oi, oi, oi. Oi, oi, oi, oi.♫”

Free a leg, kick him while pinned.

“♫É par quebrar kuduro. Vamos dançar kuduro.♫”

A few grazes before his arm is across my throat.

“♫Oi, oi, oi. Oi, oi, oi, oi.♫”

My tail presses against his neck, pulling as I kick.

“♫Seja morena ou loira. Vem balançar kuduro .Oi, oi, oi.♫”

We break and roll up.

“♫¡La mano arriba, cintura sola! ¡Da media vuelta, danza kuduro!♫”

I’m panting and batting my ears. Burning up. His shirtless body is glistening.

“♫¡No te canse’ ahora, que esto solo empieza! ¡Mueve la cabeza, danza kuduro!♫”

I’m jealous as he’s already charging me. Human endurance is absurd. He got me on his rhythm. The song!

“♫¡La mano arriba, cintura sola! ¡Da media vuelta, danza kuduro!♫”

I duck a fist that’s never thrown and take a knee to the chest.

""♫¡No te canse' ahora, que esto solo empieza! ¡Mueve la cabeza, danza kuduro!♫""

He has me where he wants me. He's been playing me. Any attempt to hit would be blocked.

“♫Balança que é uma loucura. Morena, vem a meu lado. Ninguém vai ficar parado. Quero ver mexer kuduro.♫”

I have no idea what’s happening as my mind swims. I can’t read him in time and take glancing hits.

“♫Balança que é uma loucura. Morena, vem a meu lado. Ninguém vai ficar parado, oh.♫”

He’s wearing me down and overwhelming me. Each of us grazing the other.

“♫Oi, oi, oi. Oi, oi, oi, oi.♫”

This is perfect. I want more.

“♫É par quebrar kuduro. Vamos dançar kuduro.♫”

I need to learn this. So much I don’t know.

“♫Oi, oi, oi. Oi, oi, oi, oi.♫”

The flame burns brighter.

“♫Seja morena ou loira. Vem balançar kuduro.♫”

Ralchi's gift. A fighter's soul.

“♫Oi, oi, oi. (¡El Orfanato!)♫”

Even if I can keep blocking, I’m done.

“♫¡La mano arriba (vai, vai; vuelta), cintura sola (vai, via; vuelta)! ¡Da media vuelta (vai, vai; vuelta), danza kuduro (vai, vai; vuelta)!♫”

I couldn’t be happier as I’m backed into the ropes.

“♫¡No te canse’ahora (vai, vai; vuelta), que esto solo empieza (vai, vai; vuelta)! ¡Mueve la cabeza (vai, vai; vuelta), danza kuduro (vai, vai; vuelta)!♫”

I get in a few kicks, but Jordan knocks them aside.

“♫¡La mano arriba, cintura sola! ¡Da media vuelta, danza kuduro!♫’

He’s not even trying to get strikes in, just pokes.

“♫¡No te canse’ ahora, que esto solo empieza! ¡Mueve la cabeza, danza kuduro!♫”

We both know I’ve lost.

We’re laughing as I collapse into Jordan. “You win! You win! That was perfect! Thank you!”

Jordan laughs. “I thought you aliens didn’t have magic?”

“Huh?”

“Anti-seer tactics. Bad against anybody else. Last-minute decisions. Shifting mid-action. Committing to every feint. Fighting to trick the future, not the present.”

“Huh?” What’s he trying to say?

“Legs, you’ve got magic. You can see the future.”

1ovhswh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ovhswh/aitah_fir_doing_this/,AITAH fir doing this?,"I really need some help with the situation below because I honestly don’t know if I did the right thing or I did something wrong.

My parents came to visit me and my husband in the Middle East, as we recently moved here. My father has always been a strange and unpredictable person, but I tried to put that aside and still invited him and my mother to stay with us.

When we were kids, he used to scream at us, insult us, and sometimes be emotionally abusive. I’ve always believed he might have some sort of bipolar disorder, although he’s never been diagnosed.

He woke up this morning and had coffee with me and my mum. After a while, he suddenly got mad at her because in a picture she took of him, there was a bag visible he said it made him look homeless.

Later, I took them on a walk. My mum asked me to take a picture of them together but he refused to be in the photo, started walking about 30 steps ahead of us and completely stopped talking to us. We sat on a bench for a while, and then he disappeared for about 20 minutes. When he came back, he stood about 20 steps away from us and still wouldn’t speak or come near. We decided to leave and looked around for him, but we couldn’t find him.  
We eventually left the place as we were under the impression that he knows how to come back. He did not have his phone, watch, or any money with him. My husband and I went looking for him and couldn’t find him anywhere.

This kind of behaviour isn’t new, he used to do the same when we were kids. We were always walking on eggshells, depending on whether he was in a “good” or “bad” mood. I still remember once, in the middle of winter, he got furious because my mum accidentally hit a curb with the car he bought her. He started hitting her, I screamed at him, and he got so angry that he walked off for over an hour in freezing weather. When he came back, he didn’t speak to us for days.

After being gone for hours today, we received a phone call from a random person who said my dad had approached her because they spoke a similar language and he told her he was lost. My husband and I went to pick him up. The lady told us he had said he was lost, but when he got in the car, he didn’t say a single word to us. He walked straight into the house, went to his room, and later texted my sister saying he wants to return home as soon as possible And that myself and my mum left him behind.  
He came out of the guest room and said I should been ashamed of myself etc and this is where I lost my cool. I started losing my sh\*\* and told him everything.

I spent a lot of money on their trip, and this is the behaviour I get in return. I asked my mum to stay behind, but I have a feeling he told her that maybe she isn’t allowed to return back home if she doesn't leaves tomorrow morning with him.

 I thought that as he got older, he might realise things and change but it doesn’t seem to be the case.

1ovhqqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/1ovhqqk/is_it_crazy_to_expect_payment_for_a_short_film/,Is it crazy to expect payment for a short film “collaboration”?,"A filmmaker recently reached out and said he wants to meet for coffee to “collaborate” on a short film. But it’s not clear if he’s offering paid work or just looking for someone to help bring his ideas to life.

At this point, I’m mainly focusing on paid projects. I’ll occasionally do an unpaid one if it’s creatively fulfilling or with people I really trust, but I try to balance those with paid gigs. Payment isn’t just about money. It’s a guarantee that the work actually means something. Even if they don’t end up using what I create, at least I come out with something for my time and effort.

There’s also no guarantee that the director or producer will ever help you in the future. That whole “we’ll carry each other” idea sounds nice, but it rarely holds up. And how many times have we all heard “we’ll pay you on the next one”? Usually the director benefits the most, so they don’t really care. Meanwhile, crew members often still get paid, even if it’s deferred, so why shouldn’t that apply to writers too?

Am I being unreasonable to expect some form of payment (or at least clarity about it) when someone wants to “collaborate”? Or is this just how the indie film world works: you have to gamble on unpaid work sometimes?

I don’t want to sound entitled, but I also don’t want to keep investing time into projects that might never happen.

What if Camus had white monster instead of coffee? After a few cans, we’d have the ultimate motivational speaker.

Imagine a book titled ""*Is There a Meaning in This Can? Yes, 150mg (And 0g Sugar)*"" with coffee rendered utterly useless in the face of this caffeinated revelation.

As for Sisyphus, he’d surely break the curse. After just one drink (0 sugar ofc he’s monitoring his carb intake afterall) he’d throw the rock with such intensity that it would evaporate from all the heat.

He’s super flirty with me — like, *constantly.* He teases me all the time, calls me *habibi*, *babe*, *queen*, says I’m a “baddy with a fatty”, sends kissy-heart emojis, and once even said *“I love you my habibi”* and *“I’ll miss you dearly"".*

He notices when I’m stressed and checks on me, waited around for me to finish taking a meeting at a coffee shop  and we text all day in a group chat that basically turns into just us talking.

But in person, he gets awkward — can’t really hold eye contact (sometimes wears shades when we talk), and uses humour to deflect anything remotely serious. Some strangers in the sauna noticed our banter and said we should get married.

Recently, I got tired of wondering, so I asked him whether the flirting was real or for fun and his response was vague. He just joked it off saying he likes to annoy me and changed the subject.

He’s also said before that he’s *never dated someone he was friends with first* — which felt like a way of setting boundaries, but then he’ll still call me cute names, tease me, and send hearts.

So now I’m stuck wondering:

* Is he actually into me but scared to make a move or emotionally unavailable?
* Does he just like the attention and validation?
* Or is this genuinely platonic and I’m misreading everything?

The mixed signals are driving me insane. Why tell me “I love you” or send kissy hearts if it’s just friendship? Why check on me, wait around, and flirt every single day if it means nothing?",2,1762982104.0,AskMenAdvice,19,0.67,False

I would just put whatever into my body. I had a fast food addiction and would eat cheeseburgers basically daily, or chicken wraps. I was around 260 pounds. 

I didn’t really care about my looks, or physical health, or nutrition, because I didn’t think I was really worth anything.

I had dinner with someone I respected deeply, and she was vegan. I remember saying “wow I really respect that. I could never do that though. I like chicken too much” (as I’m eating a chicken wrap). 

Then I watched dominion documentary, and after that horror show, never craved meat again. If anything, it made me physically ill. Every time I saw a cheeseburger I would have flashes of the horrors that animal were put through. Putting that dead corpse in my mouth would be revolting. 

Never pulled into fast food drive thrus (except for the occasional plant based burger or coffee with almond/oat milk) and now I’m super into nutrition.
 
I’ve lost a lot of weight since I was obese then.

My body feels like a beautiful garden now rather than a graveyard 

I initially knew nothing of vegan cooking. I starved myself for 2 days after I went vegan overnight, since I was so disgusted by the meat, egg and dairy industry. 

Made me physically ill to look at animal based foods which was all I knew, I never ate vegetables or beans or anything really before I went vegan. And I certainly knew nothing about tofu, tempeh, seitan… 

Now I’m eating a plentiful diet and I don’t feel restricted at all. I feel lighter and better. Losing weight effortlessly 

I’m even eating mushrooms! I hated mushrooms my whole life, but in comparison to a corpse? Doesn’t seem so bad. You can fry them up and make them taste like chicken…

I would have never been able to stop eating fast food on a daily basis if it weren’t for the vegan movement. 

I would have just continued to get fatter and fatter, helpless to stop. Probably would have gotten some kind of serious physical health problem eventually… 

But now I don’t even struggle with it. I don’t crave dead animals or products that involve suffering. 

Being vegan saved me from myself. 

My cholesterol is better, blood pressure, my head is clearer, I feel so light every day… I feel blessed 

I’m also less likely to die of cancer, stroke, heart attack… list goes on. Meat is highly processed and carcinogenic. Even a reduction in meat can assist people.

It was a peaceful Monday morning in the cul-de-sac. A young girl named Annie was in her house holding her dog Tommy in her hands. Her dad was asleep on the couch. “You wanna go outside, Tommy?”, Annie asked. Annie followed Tommy into the streets of the cul-de-sac. Tommy led her into a vacant construction zone and saw an anomaly in front of him. He ran into it. Annie found the anomaly with no sign of Tommy anywhere. “Woah! What is this?”, she asked. “Are you in there, Tommy?”, she asked. Annie ran through the anomaly.

After traveling through the anomaly, Annie arrived in a star-lit desert in the Silurian period. Her dog disappeared here. “Woah, what is this place?”, she commented. Suddenly, strange shapes started moving beneath the sand, quickly turning her wonder into fear.

At the Peach Creek ARC, Double D’s ADD registered the cul-de-sac construction zone anomaly. “New anomaly, guys!”, Double D said. Suddenly, a power surge hit the entire building. This disabled the ADD. “Gotta reboot it, guys”, Double D said. However, after he rebooted it, the ADD registered no anomalies. “C’mon. There was an anomaly!”, Double D said frustratingly. “Don’t tell anybody about this, but I suspect that someone tapped the power, and stole the anomaly’s location using spyware”, Ed told Double D.

Ed was right and Eddy’s brother was in the cul-de-sac, sitting in his car with a laptop signaling the anomaly. He dispatched a group of soldiers, led by The Employee through the anomaly. “Go, guys”, Eddy’s brother told them.

In the Silurian, the soldiers saw Annie. “Someone’s here. She’s a little girl”, one of them said. “Should we save her?”, the same one asked. “Nah, she’s not the reason we’re here”, another one of them told the other. Annie saw the soldiers. “Hey! Over here!”, she called out to them. The soldiers didn’t listen to her cries when suddenly, an unknown creature emerged from the sand, and launched an attack on them. The soldiers shot at the creature to no effect. All of the soldiers were killed by the unknown monster. Annie covered her ears as the sounds of fighting and screams faded away.

Eddy returned to his house in the cul-de-sac to find Helena there again, this time in the shower. “What are you doing here, Helena?”, Eddy asked. “I got slimed while I was traveling in the Devonian. Needed to wash off the nasty stuff”, Helena replied. When she got done, she told Eddy something he did not know. “There are two traitors in the Peach Creek ARC: Ed and Kevin”, Helena told him. “That’s not good”, Eddy said. Before the two could talk about this any further, Eddy got a call from the team about the anomaly. “Ok, I’ll be right there”, he said. “Sorry, Helena. Gotta go”, he apologized before leaving.



9:25 AM



After Eddy left, Helena called his brother. “I want a report of how the mission went as soon as the soldiers get back”, she demanded. “Okay, I’ll make sure it gets to you as soon as they return!”, Eddy’s brother told her on the phone.



10:10 AM



The team discovered the anomaly’s location: it was in a construction zone in the cul-de-sac. Ed was accompanied by a well-dressed April. The latter had just left an engagement party held by her future in-laws. The team went to investigate. Eddy’s brother had fled the scene. On the phone, he talked to Helena some more. “Ed and the team are here!”, he told her. “The soldiers never returned”, he added. “There will be severe consequences if Ed finds out what we are doing”, she threatened before furiously hanging up on him.

Ed and April found the anomaly when suddenly, a little dog ran out. It was Annie’s dog, Tommy. “That’s a fast little guy!”, Ed commented. “So cute. But where’s his owner?”, April said. “I think the answer is right in front of us”, Ed said. “They’re on the other side”, April said. Ed called Marie and Double D. “We’ve found the anomaly. It’s here in the cul-de-sac, in the middle of a construction zone”, Ed told them. “No one’s working here right now, though. So it shouldn’t be too bad”, Ed added.

While were attacked by the Mer creatures last month, I told her I loved her”, Double D replied. “That’s awesome, but I want you to do what you feel is best. But remember, you’re gonna have to dump Sarah if you want a true relationship with Marie”, Eddy told him.

Ed and Eddy walked through the Silurian. “Sand, sand, and more sand”, Eddy commented. The two eventually came across the remnants of the soldier’s battle with the so-far unknown creatures. “What happened here?”, Eddy asked. “I don’t know, but it was really nasty by the looks of it”, Ed replied. They found weapons and night-vision goggles still intact. On the latter, footage of the battle was shown. “These people were attacked by something”, Ed said after viewing the camera footage on the goggles. “We should these guns just in case whatever attacked these guys comes back”, Eddy told him. “This could be evidence of there being a traitor in the Peach Creek ARC”, Eddy commented. “I’m not surprised that there could be one”, Ed replied.



10:00 AM



They headed in the direction of Annie and found her standing on a large rock. “Hey! Over here! Help me!”, she yelled. They came to the rock and climbed on it to reach her. Unbeknownst to them, the same mysterious creature that killed the soldiers, pursued them from under the sand. “Don’t worry. We’re here to save you!”, Ed told her. “I’m Ed and this is Eddy”, they told Annie. “My name is Annie. Thanks for coming to save me. I don’t like this place and there’s big scary monsters here that come up from underground to eat you. They killed a group of men that also came here out of that weird glowing light portal thing”, Annie told them. “It’s called an anomaly”, Ed told her. “Okay, let’s go”, Ed said. The trio then got off the rocks and got ready to escape the Silurian.

He texted to her that he was dumping her on his phone.

Sarah was furious and prepared to leave. Before she headed out the door, she saw Rex sitting on a table. “You ugly thing!”, she yelled. She decided to take her frustration out on poor Rex. Sarah threw multiple plates at him, but luckily he dodged them. She then grabbed a tennis racket and knocked him out unconscious. Sarah then stole him while he was asleep.

In the Silurian desert, Ed ,Eddy, and Annie walked through the sands. The trio came across dozens of Silurian millipedes called Eoarthropleura that ran by their feet. “Are those bugs?”, Annie asked. “Yep, Eoarthropleura. They’re Silurian millipedes”, Ed told her. “It looks like they’re running away from something”, Eddy commented. “Probably from the creatures I told you about that killed those men I saw earlier”, Annie said. “We’d better get out of here, then!”, Ed said. “There they are!”, Annie yelled. The trio ran away as fast as they could from the sand creatures that were coming to eat them. One of the Eoarthropleuras went astray and ran towards the anomaly.

Back in the modern day, Marie, and Double D were still in the construction zone, monitoring the anomaly. Suddenly, the Eoarthropleura ran out of the anomaly. “What’s that?”, Double D asked. “Looks like a bug. A millipede to be exact”, Marie said. “Let’s get it before it causes any trouble”, Double D said. The two set off to catch the runaway bug.

The Eoarthropleura ran into a restaurant and Marie, and Double D pursued it inside. “Sorry!”, Double D apologized to one of the chefs. “Don’t mind us!”, Marie apologized to the same chef. The bug ran into the restaurant’s play place and hid from the Peach Creek ARC members in the ball pit. Marie caught the runaway bug, while Double D seemed to be having fun playing in the ball pit. “Double D! Get out of that ball pit!”, Marie told him. “Sorry, just having a little fun”, he replied.



11:12 AM



The two returned the millipede back to its own time through the anomaly. After returning the bug however, the anomaly started showing signs of closing. “Uh, oh. It’s weakening!”, Double D said. “They’re still not back yet!”, Marie said.

The trio were making their way back to the anomaly as it was weakening. “Quick! It’s about to close!”, Ed said. Him, Annie, and Eddy ran as fast as they could for the anomaly, but unfortunately, were unable to reach it in time. The anomaly closed and it was too fast for them. “No!”, Ed yelled frustratingly. “Crap!”, Eddy said. “Well, guess we’re trapped here forever”, Annie said angrily.

Double D and Marie returned to the Peach Creek ARC. “Hey, Kevin. We’ve got bad news”, Double D told him. “Yep. The anomaly closed and Ed, and Eddy are now trapped in the Silurian!”, Marie said. “Well, looks like Spongebob, and Sandy are now the ones in charge of the anomaly operation”, Kevin commented. “They may still be alive, though. Ed and Eddy may be able to survive for several weeks if they can find a water source”, Double D said. “I want a watch on the anomaly site and if it reopens, whatever the cost, go in after them”, Kevin told April who came into the office. “What do I tell April’s dad?”, April asked. “Just tell him we did our best”, Kevin said.

Meanwhile, in the Silurian sands, Ed, Eddy, and Annie kept walking. To the trio’s relief, their hand-held anomaly detector detected another anomaly. “Yes! There’s still hope! It’s another anomaly!”, Ed said delightfully. “It’s another anomaly! We have to find it fast”, he said. “That’s good, but I think we have something bigger on our hands at the moment: a sandstorm”, Eddy said. “Oh no!”, Annie yelled. The team sheltered under a cave to escape the sandstorm before setting out to find the anomaly. The sandstorm eventually stopped and they then set off to find the anomaly.



12:00 PM



As they continued on through the desert, they were confronted by the leader of the late soldiers: The Employee. “Hand over your water and your device or I shoot!”, the Employee threatened. “I remember you”, Ed told him. The team didn’t give him what he wanted, but he didn’t shoot at them: he instead shot at the ground. This disturbed one of the unknown giant creatures under the sand. It attacked The Employee from under the sand, dragging him down to make him its next meal. Eddy walked over to him as he was being taken down into the sand. “Who are you working for?”, he asked. “I will never tell you!”, The Employee said. The Employee was then dragged to his death under the sand by the creature.



12:05



The trio then crossed the sand dunes as slowly and subtly as they could to avoid drawing the attention of the creatures, and reach the anomaly. Unfortunately, Annie fell over, luring in one of the creatures. “Argh!”, she screamed. The creature dragged down Eddy. “Hey! You put him down!”, Annie yelled. Annie jumped up and down to distract the creature from eating Eddy. The creature emerged from the sand. It was a gigantic Silurian scorpion called Jaekelopterus. It was clutching Eddy in its claws. Before it could kill Eddy or attack Annie and Ed, a second scorpion attacked it, forcing it to drop Eddy. Eddy fell onto the sand safely. He ran over to get Annie to safety. Ed grabbed the night-vision goggles, proof of the Peach Creek ARC’s traitor’s identity. He grabbed them just before the Silurian scorpion reached him. The other scorpion attacked the first scorpion again, allowing Ed to catch up with Eddy, and Annie. The Silurian scorpion killed the other one and then proceeded to follow after the fleeing trio. The trio slided down a sand dune on a giant rock. They raced down the dune and found the anomaly. “There it is!”, Annie said. The scorpion was coming in hot. Eddy shot at the creature until his gun was out of ammo. The bullets did no effect but piss it off even more. He then dropped the gun, escaped, and ran through the anomaly with Annie, and Ed before it catch them. The scorpion gave up the chase and dug back into the sand.



Woods just outside of Peach Creek



Monday, February 5, 2007, 12:30 PM



After entering the anomaly, the team found themselves in a forest in a yet-to-be-confirmed time period. “When are we?”, Annie asked. “Looks like we could be anywhere in the Ice Age, at least a thousand years ago”, Ed said. The trio kept walking through the woods until they came across what looked like a primitive tent and crude stone weapons. “I think we’re sometime in the Middle Paleolithic. This time period was very dangerous so I think we should find another anomaly”, Ed said. “What was so dangerous about then?”, Eddy asked. “Cave bears, cave lions, saber-tooth cats, and worst of all, early man”, Ed explained. Before they could do anything else, what looked like a caveman, clad in animal skin clothing, and armed with a sharp spear found them. However, something was off: he was wearing converse all-stars. “Wait a minute: look at his shoes”, Annie pointed out. “They look like converse all-stars. Neanderthals didn’t wear those”, Annie said.



12:35 PM



“I don’t get paid enough for this job”, the actor said frustratingly before leaving. “Well, that means we’re back in the modern day”, Ed said. Marie and Double D emerged from the woods, having used the anomaly detector to find them. “Yes! You’re back!”, Marie said. “And still alive”, Double D added. “I’m so glad to be back!”, Annie said. “You guys are heroes”, she told Ed, and Eddy. The team got ready to leave. Kevin was also there. “This is Planet Prehistoric Adventure Park”, Kevin said. “Dinosaurs, cavemen, and fun”, Kevin explained to the rest of the team. “I’m glad you’re back, Ed. I prefer you to be in charge of the anomaly operation instead of Double D”, Kevin told Ed. “Thanks”, Ed said. Ed and Eddy did not say anything else due to the fear of treachery within the Peach Creek ARC, with Kevin among the suspects.



Cul-de-sac



3:00 PM



The team returned to Peach Creek to take Annie home. “You guys are my heroes. I wanna work with you when I grow up!”, Annie told Ed. “We’ll be happy to hire you, Annie!”, Ed told her before she left. “Thanks for saving my daughter!”, her dad thanked him. “Oh, and our dog, Tommy, too!”, he added, as he was holding Tommy in his arms. “You did a good job today, Ed”, April told him. The two then drove off with the rest of the team to return back to the Peach Creek ARC.



Marie’s trailer, Park N’ Flush Trailer Park



3:22 PM



Marie and Double D returned to their trailer park to find Rex missing and broken dishes, and other items all over the floor. “What happened here?”, Double D asked. “I don’t see Rex anywhere. Rex!”, Marie said. She didn’t get a response.



Peach Creek ARC



4:00 PM



Back at the Peach Creek ARC, Ed left the night-vision goggles he found in the Silurian sands in his office for later examination when he went to get a cup of coffee. After he came back, he found that they had been stolen. “Where’d they go?”, he asked to himself, confused by their disappearance.



The end credits roll….



Next time on Ed, Edd N Eddy Primeval…



Ed sets out to unmask the Peach Creek ARC traitor, only for his plans to be interrupted when a giant mammoth appears on a busy highway just outside of Peach Creek in broad daylight. The team rushes to the highway and eventually manages to trap the beast in the back of a giant truck, but suspiciously, Eddy is nowhere to be found.

*More Details*

Something about the way we experience media feels different now – colder, maybe? Everything’s a subscription; the “daily doom scroll” has become the norm; small creators race the algorithm while big ones are burnt out at the finish line; and AI-generated noise floods the internet. At the same time I have noticed that there are many corners of the world where local creativity is eclipsed by the glare of universal talent. I see this often here in New Zealand, where I’m from. And on top of all this, I miss the shared watch-times, the live reactions, the feeling of community that broadcast TV once gave us.

Maybe it’s nostalgia, or maybe it’s proof that we’re ready to remix the past into something new?… 

That’s where Alcova comes in… Alcova is a digital village where art takes its time. It’s a calm, retro-inspired platform where art-lovers can explore films, music videos, and more (I’m talking art galleries, digital book stores / libraries, concerts, creative games, art tutorial spaces / art jams, digital coffee shops to meet other cool local creators) – not by scrolling, but by walking through pixel-art houses and tuning into scheduled broadcasts. 

It’s slow internet, shared joy, and a space for local creators to shine without chasing algorithms. There’s also a built-in digital connection to in-person community-building element that makes Alcova rare, and necessary in this age where we long for a mass revival of bustling third spaces (more on this in the ‘Alcova’s Fundamentals’ section). ",1,1762981506.0,design_critiques,0,1.0,False

Alright, so I did something I never thought I’d do — I actually followed a *digital pregnancy fitness plan* for 30 days straight. It’s called **Fit To Be Pregnant**, and yes, I almost quit during week one… but I’m ridiculously glad I didn’t.  

Because, no exaggeration — my **energy levels tripled.**  

I don’t know if it was the sleep hacks, the light nutrient tweaks, or the surprisingly gentle workout structure, but by the end of the month I felt *supercharged.* Not like the “guzzled three iced coffees before noon” kind of energy, but that stable, calm, “I’m glowing for no reason” type.  

Here’s what actually stood out after a full 30-day trial:  

- **No gym madness required.** Most “fit while pregnant” programs are brutal or unrealistic. This one felt do-able even on my sluggish days.  
- **Nutritional advice that isn’t fear-driven.** It’s refreshing to have guidance rooted in clarity, not chaos.  
- **A digital format that finally feels human.** Instead of cold, robotic instructions, it’s like a knowledgeable friend gently cheering you on through your phone.  

By week three, my husband asked what vitamins I was sneaking. None. Just consistency and support that actually stuck.  

If you’ve been itching for more control over your prenatal health (without turning it into an obsession), this might be your sign. Give yourself the space to feel genuinely energized again — even while your body’s changing daily.

I have a group of friends in a city, and have for a decade. 1 of them (husband's friend, really) is not much of a great friend to us. He creates a lot of problems, spills beans on things he's not supposed to, and - while charming - is quite selfish. I can't exactly exclude him, as he's friends with people in the group, but I would say: he has caused me and my husband more problems that other members may know.

My best friend just moved here from Denver, largely for me and for life opportunities. I'm so excited to have him here - it's a 25 year friendship, since 4th grade. The problem-friend and my best friend didn't know each other previously. They have no history.

The problem-friend has seemingly ""leeched"" onto my best friend in quite an atypical way. While *I've* never been asked to coffee or happy hour directly by the problem-friend, he's invited *my* best friend (one-on-one) biweekly at this point to these activities. My best friend is a very nice guy, and says yes to everything. 

Something about this feels like a social faux paux. To have my best friend move here, to then get bombarded randomly with invites and plans from this problem-friend is a bit jarring. It's as if the problem-friend just kind of decided to bypass me, and it's becoming a little strange to keep hearing from my best friend that problem-friend invited them to do X and that they're doing it. Problem-friend has also given out invites that were not his to give (ie., plans my husband and I set up).

I've alluded to my best friend that the problem-friend has caused issues for us and our group, without directly talking smack on the problem-friend.

I completely understand that two adults can hang out without my permission. My goal in this is not to be included in these plans. I think my best friend doesn't really know the depths of problems that the problem-friend creates due to their selfishness.

I would never do this to someone else, which makes me feel like something here is wrong. My husband and I are deciding what the ""least-asshole"" thing to do is. Talk to my best friend? My husband talking to his friend about how it's coming off? We really don't want to ruin any friendships, but this social faux paux is upsetting us.

I'm not asking for judgement the problem-friend, or a list for users to determine judgement on them. I'm asking if this problem-friend *bypassing* me entirely and forming this connection with *my* best friend has me justified in talking to my best friend.

Some background first. My parents moved to Europe, specifically England, about 5ish years before I was born. I turned 18 in July. They're from America and were homeless there for a few years before they met and survived that together for a few years after. They're pretty open about that fact. They met at a homeless shelter, actually. When they moved here they did the whole 180, opened a few small businesses, did a lot of investing, and did a lot of networking.

For my 18th birthday my mom bought me an apartment in France. She said it could be anywhere but I love France and I have some college applications out so my plan is to settle down here. It's not overly huge; two bedrooms, one bath and it's a few miles outside of Paris. My parents are pretty good friends with the man who owns the building so they got a good deal. I'm in charge of paying taxes, maintenance, utilities, and I furnish it out of my pocket. I work two part-time jobs until I go to college where I'm going to drop one. My mom set me up an emergency fund that has about 5k in it and they will match my contributions until I turn 25. (Important)

Recently, I furnished my place enough to have a housewarming party. Six friends came. I didn't want to really tap into the logistics of my place but everyone kind of bombarded me since the rent in this neighborhood is high and they wanted to know how I got it. For context, my parents house is modest enough and I'm pretty open about their past. When I said my mom bought it for me it got...weird? Everyone just moved on to different questions or making plans for parties or whatever but C totally shut down. She wouldn't talk, hid in the bathroom for about 30 minutes then left pretty abruptly. 

The next day she asked to meet up, which I agreed. We got coffee and I just let her lead the conversation. She asked what I'm paying for and about my savings, which I was open about. C immediately laid into me. She called me a liar and that I falsified who I was because, in her words, ""there's no way two homeless people could eventually afford an apartment in France of all places"" and that she wanted the ""truth""

I told her it was the truth and that she's being weird for taking something that has nothing to do with her so personally. She started crying (????) and told me that if she knew I was some high and mighty b\*\*\*\* she wouldn't have wasted the last few years on our ""fake friendship"" and that all of the times we split the bill or her treating me to dinner was me taking advantage of her and manipulating her good nature. (I treated her too so ??)

We went back and forth for a while but it didn't go anywhere just me asking, repeatedly, what about this makes me fake and how my apartment affects her and C saying that I'm a liar. I just left after about an hour of this and texted her later that I was sorry for upsetting her but I could't fix this if I didn't know how. She said that there isn't any fixing this and that I was privileged and that I should have been upfront about our money instead of making me seem relatable by saying how homeless my mom and dad were. For reference, I never used their past to seem more relatable I was just raised with that in mind. Saving money, being grateful, making smart choices, etc and I was proud of them. Wouldn't anyone be?

Now C won't speak to me and my friends are divided. Some say that she's blowing everything out of proportion and a few are saying that I wasn't being fully honest like a good friend should be. The reason I'm asking if I'm TA is because, in our last text, I told her that her financial insecurities aren't my problem and to grow up.

TLDR; My friend, C, found out that my mom bought me an apartment outside of Paris and thinks that I manipulated her by lying about my parents coming from homelessness and took advantage of her for money.",0,1762980774.0,AITAH,5,0.5,False

*Notes: hinoki, cannabis terpenes, ocean mist, aldehydes, mimosa blossom, tonka bean, deer musk accord(vegan)*

I wrote this without looking at the notes, though i did remember the cannabis terpenes bc that scared me lol.

Oooo this one is interesting. Unisex-ish but more masculine. There's an airy quality to this, maybe aldehydes? It's like something smells cool but not cold. Something musky/funky (must be the cannabis terpenes), something a little green. It smells like you're hugging someone in a leather jacket that went for a hike in the cooler months and smelling the top of their head. Something slightly sweet underneath it all, and something watery? but not a typical aquatic.

Okay yeah looking at the notes I can smell the deer musk now, it's what I thought might've been leather & ""someone's hair"" smell. The mimosa blossom must be what's sweetening this. The hinoki is the green quality, the ocean mist is the aquatic. Not sure i get the tonka bean though. It's super unique. If you're interested in unique atmospherics, definitely give this one a try -- I could not predict how it would smell with all those notes. I don't get any weed smell either thankfully as I can't stand it lol, i think it's just playing well in the background with the other notes.

Over time the funkiness is dying down and it turns more classically aquatic while retaining the atmospheric quality. I did like the musk, but I'm not mad at this.

After several hours, it has died back into something slightly sweet and aquatic. 

I think i'll full size this one. It's a little off-beat yet very wearable still. I'm gonna try layering this with something a little deeper/earthier, or something bright and green. (Since writing this I've layered it with a bpal trio Coffee/Oak bark/Patchouli and it plays really well with that).

*Notes: Warm hay, honeycomb, patchouli, texas cedar, light incense and an absolutely filthy civeted rose.*

This was the free sample that came with my order. It's surprisingly really nice! It's not something i would've picked for myself. On my skin the honey really comes through. Somehow the combination of the everything else smells a little like tea to me, maybe a white tea? Though I can definitely get the rose in there too. I haven't smelled a ton of different roses, but I like this one.

My dad said it smells like one of those shops that has pot pourri somewhere (i assume he means a metaphysical store lol, there is incense in the notes which he must be picking up on, but i can't detect it!). 

She's fading pretty quickly on my skin, though :-( The patchouli picks up a little more over time, though it's light and tame. Makes me tempted to try other cirrus scents I'm hesitant about.

After several hours, I mostly get something vaguely green and sweet. ",13,1762980769.0,Indiemakeupandmore,1,1.0,False

The rest of the family live 10 hour plane ride and 18 hour plane ride away, so different timezones and far.. My dad was initially going to come on Sunday. Now, suddenly his car is broken, which he had fixed a month ago (he told my son on the weekend, my son looked so sad). He usually comes on his motorbike anyway. He doesn't have a lot of money, and always acts out at Christmas or birthdays out of embarrassment. We have accepted that we won't get a present, we just want him here. My kids are also busy writing exams at the moment as a side note, which is why we initially were going to do the weekend. My son is even postponing celebrating with friends until exams are over. So this is a big deal birthday, with nobody but myself, his girlfriend and his brother. My dad is always trying to guilt us. He phoned today, I thought oh good, he's made a plan to come, but no. More excuses. He told me it is a little far. I said what do you mean a little far? I hung up on him. I am so hurt, do we not matter? Then he phoned my son and tells him his friend died yesterday and he's feeling sad. He had no friends. How about celebrating the family you have! He was very abusive to my mom when I was growing up and pulled these emotional games with us, and he had money then, so it's not all about not having money. I hate that my kids have to feel let down like I did as a kid. After my husband died, he really made an effort, but the last few years has been like this. Christmas 2023 he threw his wrapped gift that my son gave him, because he didn't have gifts for us. It was coffee mugs that my son picked out, which broke.

1ovh2uh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1ovh2uh/finally_figured_out_why_i_felt_like_shit_almost/,Finally figured out why I 'felt like shit' almost all the time,"TL:DR: got diagnosed when I was almost 18 years old, 26 now and just beginning to realise/accept the magnitude of how it affects my functioning and life. Just sharing my story because I assume many of you are, or have been on the same journey. I do want to hear your stories and experiences; in which ways did you (for a long time) not realise ASD impacted you? What does your journey of acceptance look like? How did it change you? How did you struggle with acceptance? ... ?   
Also; do share your experience with chronic pain and how to distinguish 'autistic overstimulation pain' versus 'actual' pain.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

It's somehow disappointing and cathartic (though I still have to feel that 'release') at the same time. 'Disappointing' because it took me so long to figure this out; knowing/accepting this could've spared me so much mental anguish. Cathartic because I am getting closer to understanding and accepting myself, making me feel like I am finally able to work with 'my true self' and to actually start living. 

My life in secondary school and college were mainly characterized by constant fatigue -along with depression and suicidal ideation-, a great inability to pay attention to almost anything that was taught in class. I came home not being able to recall any subject we talked about that day. Seriously, my grades were better when I skipped school on a regular basis- I was unable to absorb any information. 

It's difficult to pinpoint what exactly made me connect the dots, but as many Au(DHD) people, I struggle with chronic pain. My general practitioner mentioned that it's possible that because of the autism, I may experience pain differently. It almost rubbed me the wrong way when she mentioned this (but she's privileged as I adore her and she triggers my mommy issues)- as I was afraid she was dismissing my symptoms. 

Memories started to pop up: how used to feel in class, in the library, in dark lit coffee shops with a low ceiling, how my body starts to crawl when I stay out shopping for too long... Even though I mentally want to be there and do those things, my body always started 'acting up'. 

It made me realise how much I've actually *hated* myself for 'being like this'; for feeling bad, for not being able to 'push through it'. I figured I was just being dramatic and lazy (thanks dad). After all, those feelings 'suddenly' disappeared when I got back home and locked myself into my room. So I figured it was 'just in my head'. What else could explain that I felt like shit in school but 'suddenly' felt better when I got home? 

It's a strange realization, knowing how much you have hated and blamed yourself for this your whole life. How destructive I have acted towards myself because I and the people around me did not understand me. 

Accepting my 'limitations' is still a journey with many tears (as I may have to accept that I may not be able to accomplish my goals for my own wellbeing)- it's hard to figure out what's actually a limitation/boundary because of the autism (and thereby better to take a step back and 'just go home'), versus when it may be beneficial to 'push through'.

( not gonna self diagnose obviously but yk a lot of doctors suck so..)

So I'm gonna try to explain my situation as much as possible with many details as possible but then again I'm not gonna overwhelm myslef if I'm not remembering correctly how this is all started.

So I've been having stomach pain since I was like 16 or 17 it was minimal at first but I always feel bad when I have and I can't eat normal 
But ut was tolerable like I ate all different kind of food. But with the years going on I started noticing that this pain was getting intense tp the point where in the summer of 2024 I started experiencing sharp pain that I coudn't tolerate anymore, nausea, trouble breathing, constipation/diarrhea, acid reflux, not being able to eat food like I used( gluten, fatty greasy food, sugary food ect...).

I was also experiencing late periods from time to time with constipation and problem with emptying my bllader completely when I pee and more peeing in the day with urgency.

My perido didn't come for 6 months and I was experiencing intense pelvic pain almost feels like it's gonna pop out , did ultrasounds many times they didn't find anything, only one gyn found that I had a cyst buy I didn't believe here at first cuz she wasn't proffesional and didn't take her time or explain what was going on exactly. I had other ultrsound after , they found that I had multifoliculaire ovaries and one gyn suspected that it could be PCOS( still no definitive answer).

I also went to many urologists, no UTI.
I had a urinary manommetry to see if this could be a physical issue, everything came back normal.
I also had a pelvic MRI, everything was normal as well.
So the urologist told me it could just be stress and to go to a psychologist( I don't belive this is the main issue).

For now I'm getting ready to get a colonoscopy buut I honestly I feel hopeless that this is going to be the answer. idk but I feel there is something more hidden and complicated going on with my body.

So now I've not been able to eat normally for almost 2 years ( no sugary food, not fatty food, no coffee, not tea, no protein, no gluten you name it)
I mean it's not like I've gon allergic to all types of food in the matter of an instant, it just doesn't make sense.

I only eat easy digestible food like( fruits, vegetables, boiled potatoes, eggs, whole wheat bread and , yogurt that helps with digestion and that's it) and I still manage to get constipated.

So my problem now is: not being able to eat normally, feeling nauseous ,acid reflux, constipation, peeing a lot ( not being able to exercise or I feel the need to pee), extreme fatigue, stomach and back pain, pelvic pain even without my period, loosing coordination sometimes when I walk, things sleeping out of my hands when I hold them, blurry vision.

If anyone of you guys is  experiencing similiar symptoms and actually found a dignosis for their symptoms or a treatment plan or anything really , please feel free to comment down bellow.

Then I grew out of it: I changed my circle of friends and started developing sober relationships. Having coffee is still my favorite way to connect. 

Today I can go months without a drink and be fine...I can have dinner with friends and stop at two glasses of wine and be fine. I can control my consumption and even feel when I'm getting tipsy and feel like I don't want to be drunk and out of control...

And then there are the rare moments, maybe two or three times a year. The moments I'm frustrated and go out, or the moments I feel like rekindling with my careless self, or the moments my social anxiety is high...in those moments I have too many drinks and feel like I'm dying the next day. And every single time I'm telling myself that I'll find better strategies: stop having drinks without dinner or alternating alcoholic beverages with non alcoholic ones...

But the real problem is that I know alcohol is still this escape even if I don't use it most of the time in that way, it's a possibility and so I can always slip.

The problem? I can't decide which one to focus on next. That's where you come in—holders, miners, newbies, and legends. Give me your raw takes: love it, hate it, upgrades, or ""dude, pivot hard."" Links below if you wanna test 'em out (super basic, no frills yet).



1. [Satoshi Ball](https://satoshiball-blttcixx.manus.space/)

Like a Magic 8-Ball, but channeling Satoshi's vibes. Ask stuff like ""Buy the dip?"" or ""Is this alt a rug pull?"" and get hilarious, cryptic replies. Perfect for a laugh while deciding your next move.  

\*Why I'm pumped:\* Adds some mystic fun to Bitcoin—great for noobs to dip their toes without stress.  

\*Status:\* Live prototype, but could use AI for smarter answers. \[Try it here\](link-to-satoshi-ball)



2.[ Crypto Weather ](https://cryptoweath-76bf8scd.manus.space/) 

A daily ""forecast"" for Bitcoin: Sunny for bulls, stormy for dumps, with quick hits on price trends, sentiment, and hot news. Like your weather app, but for dodging portfolio rain.  

\*Why I'm pumped:\* Turns market chaos into something chill and glanceable—ideal for chart addicts like me.  

\*Status:\* Basics are up, but needs real-time data magic. \[Check it out\](link-to-crypto-weather)



3. [Panic Button](https://hodl.manus.space/) 

Big red button for those ""OH NO"" crash moments. ""Press"" it for calming tips, funny memes, or HODL reminders—no real trading, just sanity savers.  

\*Why I'm pumped:\* We've all had paper-hand panics; this could keep the community zen during dips.  

\*Status:\* Early version works, but open to your ideas like custom vibes or alerts. \[Hit it\](link-to-panic-button)



So, what's your pick? Satoshi Ball for the giggles? Crypto Weather for everyday utility? Panic Button to fight the FUD? Or scrap 'em and suggest something wilder? Tech tips welcome (I'm on basic web tech), or if it reminds you of another app. Would you actually use one?



Thanks for the read— this sub's gold for inspiration. Let's keep stacking sats and building cool shit! 🚀

1ovgxbb,https://i.redd.it/ah9y84em1w0g1.jpeg,brown sugar shot attempt!,"I see videos all the time where they add brown sugar into the moka pot or on top of an espresso machine shot and so I wanted to give it a try with my aeropress! I realize now that this is not a great picture lol but it is the only one I have!

I usually run hot water over the paper filter first but figured that would just cause the brown sugar to melt, so underneath the sugar is a dry filter. Brewed inverted so the sugar wouldn’t melt immediately upon adding the hot water to the chamber. 

It was packed tight enough that it did not fall into the water right away, but next time I will use less sugar so that the filter cap goes on more easily and so it is less sugary haha, it was a tad toooo much. The coffee was nothing special, a bag labelled whole beans that was accidentally pre ground instead from Rosso. “Homebody” a medium espresso blend. I did not time it, just went purely off vibes, I’m sure I could get a better cup with more serious attention paid but just wanted to have fun!

But otherwise was fun, tastes yummy with a bit of milk added! I will definitely try again! Has anyone else tried this? ☺️",5,1762980316.0,AeroPress,3,0.86,False
1ovgx5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1ovgx5t/anyone_experiencing_similar_symptoms_success_in/,"Anyone experiencing similar symptoms, success in finding a diagnosis?","Hello everyone, I'm making this post just to kinda have an idea of what's going on with my body because I have been going from doctor to doctor woth no answer ( and I still do) I wanted to tell you the story of my illness to see if anyone have similar symptoms to mine and kinda have a picture of what might be going on so I can ease my mind a little. ( not gonna self diagnose obviously but yk a lot of doctors suck so..)

So I'm gonna try to explain my situation as much as possible with many details as possible but then again I'm not gonna overwhelm myslef if I'm not remembering correctly how this is all started.

So I've been having stomach pain since I was like 16 or 17 it was minimal at first but I always feel bad when I have and I can't eat normal 
But ut was tolerable like I ate all different kind of food. But with the years going on I started noticing that this pain was getting intense tp the point where in the summer of 2024 I started experiencing sharp pain that I coudn't tolerate anymore, nausea, trouble breathing, constipation/diarrhea, acid reflux, not being able to eat food like I used( gluten, fatty greasy food, sugary food ect...).

I was also experiencing late periods from time to time with constipation and problem with emptying my bllader completely when I pee and more peeing in the day with urgency.

My perido didn't come for 6 months and I was experiencing intense pelvic pain almost feels like it's gonna pop out , did ultrasounds many times they didn't find anything, only one gyn found that I had a cyst buy I didn't believe here at first cuz she wasn't proffesional and didn't take her time or explain what was going on exactly. I had other ultrsound after , they found that I had multifoliculaire ovaries and one gyn suspected that it could be PCOS( still no definitive answer).

I also went to many urologists, no UTI.
I had a urinary manommetry to see if this could be a physical issue, everything came back normal.
I also had a pelvic MRI, everything was normal as well.
So the urologist told me it could just be stress and to go to a psychologist( I don't belive this is the main issue).

For now I'm getting ready to get a colonoscopy buut I honestly I feel hopeless that this is going to be the answer. idk but I feel there is something more hidden and complicated going on with my body.

So now I've not been able to eat normally for almost 2 years ( no sugary food, not fatty food, no coffee, not tea, no protein, no gluten you name it)
I mean it's not like I've gon allergic to all types of food in the matter of an instant, it just doesn't make sense.

I only eat easy digestible food like( fruits, vegetables, boiled potatoes, eggs, whole wheat bread and , yogurt that helps with digestion and that's it) and I still manage to get constipated.

So my problem now is: not being able to eat normally, feeling nauseous ,acid reflux, constipation, peeing a lot ( not being able to exercise or I feel the need to pee), extreme fatigue, stomach and back pain, pelvic pain even without my period, loosing coordination sometimes when I walk, things sleeping out of my hands when I hold them, blurry vision.

If anyone of you guys is  experiencing similiar symptoms and actually found a dignosis for their symptoms or a treatment plan or anything really , please feel free to comment down bellow.

I really appreciate your help.

1ovgof1,https://www.reddit.com/r/spx6900/comments/1ovgof1/the_moral_impact_of_bitcoin_and_spx6900_on_modern/,The Moral Impact of Bitcoin and SPX6900 on Modern Society,"Both Bitcoin and SPX6900, for many reasons, transform their holders at a fundamental level. One of the most remarkable examples of this transformation is how they change people’s relationship with money.

In an inflationary world, people are subconsciously incentivized to consume excessively—not only because of the relentless propaganda and marketing that flood our eyes and minds every day, but also because, deep down, we know our money is dramatically losing value. This phenomenon is especially evident in developing nations and failed states like Venezuela, my home country.

By truly understanding what Bitcoin and SPX6900 are—their potential and what they represent—the only logical conclusion is to embrace the good ol' mantra: **“HODL & DCA.”**  
This isn’t just the most secure and effective long-term strategy for building wealth; it also liberates the individual from hyperconsumerist culture. Thanks to their sound money properties, their mission, and their wealth-creation potential, people are incentivized to continuously buy and hold these assets. As a result, they become hyper-focused on this mission and naturally shed many toxic habits and behaviors common in consumer societies (e.g., excessive use of drugs and alcohol, buying $5–$10 coffees, overpriced gadgets, and status-driven fashion).

By shedding these habits, individuals return to the very roots of capitalism, much like Max Weber described in *The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism*: a systematic, disciplined approach to life and work, emphasizing efficiency, productivity, and a commitment to saving and reinvesting rather than indulging in instant gratification—accumulating wealth not for vanity, but as an end in itself.

All of this guides the individual toward a simpler, happier, more productive, and ethical way of life—one where productivity and prosperity triumph over short-term pleasure and degeneracy. This, to me, is what Bitcoiners truly mean when they say, *“Fix the money, fix the world.”*

I genuinely believe that buying Bitcoin and SPX6900 plays a vital role in repairing Western society—and, ultimately, the entire world. Therefore, flipping the stock market and saving in Bitcoin is an ethical imperative that must not be abandoned.

1ovgo8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1ovgo8x/i_dont_know_if_i_can_ever_go_back_to_my_husband/,I don’t know if I can ever go back to my husband.,"I 29F have been married to my husband 39M a little over two years and we’re separated right now — my choice. I left because I just couldn’t take being made out to be the bad guy anymore, and because he chose someone else over me yet again. He undermined a decision I made and bent over backwards for this person when he can’t even do the bare minimum for me. That was kind of the final straw.

He doesn’t always create the situations, but somehow I always end up being the one who takes the blame. The worst one was when his family was renting a house from us and refused to pay rent every month. He’s the one who told me to buy and fill out eviction papers. When we went to deliver them, his family completely tore into me — not even about the eviction, but about me as a person. They just unloaded on me. And he stood there, staring at me like a hurt little puppy, like I’d done something to him. Didn’t say a word. Didn’t defend me. Just watched. Then when I finally walked out, he followed me and asked why I had to be “so f***ing vindictive.” For literally doing what he asked me to do.

This isn’t the only time, and we rarely get past these events on the same page. One thing I should note is I am definitely more assertive. I stand up for myself and the people I love after years of being a door mat to please everyone else. He says it’s his favorite thing about me, that he’s “drawn to strong women.”. But it also feels like that’s what he hates most about me as well. He never seems to have much of a backbone in many situations and I stand up for us both and he always always always chooses the other people’s side.

That moment with the rental really changed something in me. I realized I can’t count on him to have my back. He lies about money, he’s glued to his phone, and half the time I feel like he doesn’t even like me. He mansplains everything, completely ignores me when I say I’m uncomfortable or don’t like something, and turns it into a joke if I push the issue.

He’s not a very present dad either, which just breaks my heart. I feel like I’m the one doing all the emotional heavy lifting — for the kids (6 & 13) and for the relationship. On top of that, he has zero respect for my stuff. He’s a mechanic and keeps ruining my clothes and coffee mugs by wearing/taking them to work, even after I’ve told him not to a million times. It’s like nothing that’s mine actually matters to him.

We don’t even see eye to eye politically, and he’ll bash people who think like I do. Then he’ll say, “Well not you, just everyone else.” It feels mean-spirited, like he knows exactly what he’s doing but backpedals so he doesn’t have to take responsibility. I don’t care about politics but it’s the one thing that gets under his skin and it feels like our values tied into those views affect how we want to raise our children. They aren’t aligning so it causes even more issues.

And lately, he’s been throwing it in my face that I should be grateful for everything we have — like material things are supposed to make up for how emotionally lazy he’s been. As if a roof over our heads and pets cancel out the fact that I feel miserable and unheard. He doesn’t think that any of these points I’ve wrote about are as big of a deal as I do and it makes me feel like I’m losing it.

At this point I’m just so tired. Sometimes I miss him, but mostly I feel drained and unsure. The thought of going back to that house makes me feel physically sick. I don’t know if that’s my gut telling me not to, or guilt making me feel like I should. I also am afraid of teaching our children that this is what love and a marriage is supposed to look like.

I don’t even know what I want out of this post. I just needed to get it off my chest. I’ve been carrying it around for too long and it’s eating at me. I just keep wondering if marriage is supposed to feel this confusing, or if I already have my answer and just don’t want to face it.

When things are good they’re great, but when it comes down to things or events that really matter he crumples and I’m the villain for taking initiative. Am I as crazy as I feel over this?

All I smell is musk with a very slight scent of sweet that's so far buried in the musk. 
To preface I ordered another perfume I can't think of the name but it was from lataffa a few months back and it was also supposed to be gourmand but it reeked of just musk and not in a good way. 
This one is nicer but smells nothing like what I saw online and the notes I read of it. 
 My husband says it smells nice but I am so disappointed that if smells nothing like the advertised notes to me. 
I am not versed in perfume at all mind you. So is this because of shipping? Am I supposed to leave it rest like I have seen online or is my nose just busted and I can't pick up all the notes?

 I've written one story called MAZE  with 2.5 million words and achieved 6 million views across all the platforms that I post. I have another story called Energy Eater that has roughly 250,000 words and is reaching 200,000 views, but this one I released early this year.

These are just my experiences and my thoughts on how to make a novel sustainable in the long term. If you're looking for a quick guide to get to Rising Stars or something, I don't think you'll find much value here, especially since I don't have that much experience with that. The highest I got on Rising Star was 15th on horror, in the horror subcategory with Energy, never reaching the main Rising Stars category. 

To start, let's talk about what makes your novel sustainable in the long run. And I'm not going to get into the story aspect of it just yet. We're first going to discuss how to maintain a healthy increase in readership during your story's lifetime.

# Reader Retention and Consistency

# Be Consistent

The first advice I can give is be consistent. Everyone and their grand aunty knows that. Still I'll be saying it again. If you post only once every month, or every third Wednesday after a full moon, or just whenever your dog catches its tail, then it's probably going to be hard to stay on people's minds. I’m not saying it's impossible, it's just more work you have to do.

So, find a rhythm that you can follow. Maybe five chapters a week, three chapters a week, or hell, even one chapter a week. Once you find it, stick to it. Make sure that your story can be part of someone's routine. Maybe every Friday they wake up in the morning, drink a cup of coffee, and open Royal Road to see the new chapter drop. If you manage to do that, you hook the reader, and not just because your story is great or because you are in a really interesting arc. But the moment that they can count on your story to be part of their day-to-day, even if it's only one specific day, it's much easier for them to return than it is for them to forget about it.

# Time Your Posts Strategically

Figure out what time is better for you to post, but don't focus too much on the optimal time frames for the website. We all know that there are some peaks of user interaction at certain times of the day. If you try to post your chapter in the middle of that peak, you will be drowned on the recent releases page. And while that might sound minor, it is a minor thing that could be helping you.

So, shift your posting time for just a few minutes. I altered my story's posting time by less than 10 minutes this year, and I noticed a noticeable increase in the amount of people who started reading. I even go as far as to say that in a world where everybody does that, it would end up benefiting all of us, since every time slot would be less crowded, allowing everyone to stay for longer in the recent releases page. But I do know that that's a bit of a pipe dream.

# Leverage Shoutouts

Third advice: While shoutouts are important for getting to Rising Stars and getting that uptick in people reading, they are also very helpful for the long-term. Every time you give a shoutout to someone who has a similar story, or just a story that hits a few of the same notes, you are more likely to get more readers.

Besides, if you are shouting out people who have low follow counts, their readers are much more likely to go to another unknown writer than if you were getting a shoutout from one of the big ones. I'm not saying don't try to get the shoutout from someone big, because they will help. Of course they will. But there's also a good benefit in shouting out smaller creators and in getting shoutouts from smaller creators, especially if they take the time to read your story and give a more personalized comment, aside from just pasting your code and being done with that.

# Take Care of Your Community

The last tip I can give about retaining readers is taking care of your community. I know it sounds basic, but the biggest tool we have are our readers. If they like the story, they are likely to recommend the story to someone else, who recommends to someone else, and so on. It creates a chain effect, and that's how most, if not all, famous books and stories get around.

There's a reason why the same handful of stories is always being talked about on Reddit and TikTok and whatever. It's because of the amount of free advertising they get every time someone makes a tier list and puts them on S or A tier. Even if they put it on DNF, it's already showing to a larger audience that the story is there. And I guarantee there will be a handful of people who are going to look into that just to see why that other person didn't like it.

# The Writer's Sustainability (You)

Now let's go to a different aspect of the experience, and it's you, the writer. What do you have to do to make it sustainable?

# Find Your Writing Rhythm

To start off, this goes back to one of the previous points. You need to find out how many chapters you can write a week and stick to that. If you can write more, great, but make a promise to yourself that you're going to write at least that many chapters without losing control of your life. If you have a job and you need to prioritize that, that's fine. If you have some health problems that don't allow you to write as much as you wanted, don't try to push yourself.

Find your rhythm and stick to it. This will allow you to keep consistent releases and make sure that you get to finish your work or you get to finish the current arc. Other people go for the ""rise and grind"" mentality, but if you keep grinding a whetstone, the whetstone will eventually break. Don't let that happen to you.

# When to Take a Step Back

I honestly lost count of how many times I was writing a chapter and it just wasn't working. I was trying to make a scene that I didn't like, and I'd get distracted. Every time I tried to make that one chapter happen, I didn't feel excited or interested in what was happening. If that's happening to you, what do you think will happen to your reader? You are the person who is the most invested in your story. There's likely never going to be anyone else who is more invested in your stories than you are. So, if you are not enjoying it, how do you expect others to enjoy it?

When that happens, because trust me it will happen, take a step back, think about why this chapter is not working the way you want it to, and try a different approach. Usually, it's going to flow much better once you understand the mistake you are making or the reason why the chapter wasn't really clicking, and you can act to fix that. Even if you have to drop the entire chapter and start from scratch.

And if you're wondering why is this related to taking care of yourself let me explain. When we get to a chapter that is really hard to write, a chapter that is making you struggle, a chapter that instead of taking you half a day or more to write is taking you several days, or a week, or even a month. When we get to that point, all those bad feelings of ""My story is not good enough,"" ""I'm not a good writer,"" ""What am I doing here?"" and those imposter syndrome thoughts, everything will come crashing down. 

This is something that you're going to have to learn to deal with. Because I don't know a writer who doesn't have imposter syndrome, and I don't know a writer who doesn't have those bad days. If you can recognize when that's going to happen and stop it beforehand, it's going to be easier for you in the long run.

The next point is going to be a bit bigger because it's about finding the tools that help you write. And I know you're going to read this and already go for AI, and yes, I'm going to talk about AI, but there are also other things.

# Finding the right tools

Even if you are the type of writer who doesn't really plan a lot of your story, you're gonna need to keep some notes. Either because your character has a lot of skills or there are a lot of other characters you need to keep track of, their names or alliances, or maybe you just need a place where you can write down all the names of the cities and kingdoms and whatnot.

Look, shop around for the various tools that you can use to organize that. Some people do fine with just a giant Google Doc. Others prefer something a bit more specialized like Scrivener. Personally, I really like Obsidian. It's just a Markdown text editor that has a lot of plugins, but the basic function works great.

And on a more specific hint: if your character has a lot of skills, spells, or things they can do, you could benefit from putting all that in a single page or organizing that in a way that it appears all on your computer screen while you're writing. So that when you're writing a fight, or anything that might need their abilities, you have a quick reference sheet for everything your characters can do. That way you avoid the problem of ""Oh, I forgot you had this spell to unlock doors that you got in the first five chapters of the story when I was writing chapter 324.""

This also works for maps. If you are someone who enjoys using maps, go on Inkarnate or any of the map-making tools out there and just make a map. It doesn't have to be perfect. It doesn't have to be something you want to share with your readers, just a way for you to navigate the world yourself.

And if you are ever needing some help for descriptions, my best advice would be to go to Pinterest or a place where you can get artwork. Look for something that is similar to what you want and then try to describe that thing. Just the image that you're looking at. Not your character, not the thing you are trying to make. Once you can describe the image you're seeing, go back to your work and try adding that, and try making a new description about your scene or your character. A lot of times we might struggle with visualizing in your story, especially if you are leaning more toward the fantastic. And by describing something similar, that will unlock the barrier that was created around your mind to describe the thing you're trying to describe.

On a bit of a side note, it's very rare to hear any writer talking about practicing their writing, and that is something we very much need to do. Just like how a painter practices their paintings, how if you want to draw you need to practice making circles. How if you want to be a great swimmer you practice swimming. If you want to write, you need to practice writing. And I don't mean just write more, because if you're writing more of the same thing you're not really practicing. In that case, you're only cementing the things you already do, and they can be both good or bad.

There are a few classes you can take out there, but my personal advice for this is this. Try to rewrite scenes from other stories or other media. If you struggle with fighting, watch a Dragon Ball episode and describe one of the fights. Do it as if you were writing the fight itself. If you struggle with descriptions, use the Pinterest thing I mentioned before. If you're someone who can't really do romance, but you want to do that, then write some romance. Grab Twilight and rewrite that thing. Keep in mind, this is not for you to share. This is not for you to spread around. It's practice. Sometimes good things will come from it. 

Also, this kind of goes without saying, but in this day and age, everybody should be using Grammarly or ProWritingAid or something like that. I don't care how well you think you write. Having an intelligent spell check helps. Sometimes you miss a comma, sometimes you misspell a word. We are not perfect, and while computers aren't either, they generally are better at a single function.

# AI and Productivity

Now let's talk about AI. And I ask everybody to please don't light the torches until you finish reading, because I understand there are a lot of mixed feelings with this. Some people think AI is the best thing since sliced bread. Others think it's the devil's spawn and should be burned at the stake at the sight of it. But I kind of landed more to the middle. Yes, there are awful aspects of it, and the whole fake creativity really bothers me. But on the flip side, it's an excellent tool to speed up some processes. AI is also not the pure evil thing that many make it out to be. And there are things everyone uses. 

For instance, a spell check is technically AI. So Grammarly or ProWritingAid, no matter if you're not using the AI tools that they offer, just by using them, you're technically using AI. Even if you're using just the basic spell check from Word, it's still the same thing. 

Another point is that there is not much difference between asking an AI to give you the name of a character or just a random list of male character names, than it is going to a random name generator and asking for one. Yes, there's the side that if you go to the random name generator, you might be helping someone who dedicated some time and effort to make that through ads. But technically speaking, it's the same thing.

Now let's start talking about the ways that I think AI can be used. And I'm going to start with the less controversial.

**Voice Typing:** 

Pretty much every decent voice typing app uses AI to identify your voice. But when I tell you that ever since I started voice typing I tripled my productivity, that's not a lie. I used to write three chapters every week that were roughly 2,000 words. I tried my best to increase that, but I generally only managed to do a little bit over that at most. When I started using voice typing, I managed to change that to around 3,000 words per day. That's more than a chapter. It’s a chapter and a half, which meant that I didn't have to write every single day, although I like it. 

Now, I wasn't able to maintain that every month because life gets in the way. There are times when I get sick or I have to work somewhere else, or a bunch of other stuff that stops me from doing that. But if I wasn't using voice typing, I would not be able to catch up when I fall behind or write more chapters than I was supposed to. 

**Text Cleanup and Formatting:** 

This kind of links to the first way I use AI, which might be a bit more controversial. If you voice-type a text file, it's a mess. I haven't found a single voice typing app that lets me put paragraphs or quotes, or even punctuate properly. To fix that I made a prompt specifically for my story with all the character names, all the formatting that I use, and the things that I wanted to be fixed in the pure grammar sense. I also added the things that maybe the voice typing apps mess up because of my accent. And then I run that raw voice-typed file through that prompt and receive a cleaner version that is properly formatted with paragraphs and quotation marks and all that stuff.

  
Then I go around and go through everything that is on the new file, make sure that the AI didn't hallucinate anything and didn't put anything that I myself didn't write or spoke. But you get my point. I make a first pass of editing, together with ProWritingAid, which I prefer over Grammarly. After it I do a second pass, usually with a text-to-speech app, to be sure that I didn't miss anything or there is anything that I need to change in the writing.

Now, over the course of this entire process, the AI has never written anything for me. And if it has, it made a mistake because it's not supposed to. It's supposed to only fix my text and make sure that it's properly capitalized and formatted. 

Even if the AI is formatting and cleaning things up. I'm the only one writing. I'm the only one being creative. All the ideas come from me, not the AI. 

I don't see a world where anyone could look at this and say, ""Oh, but then you're having the AI write for you."" No, I'm not, and I'm making a point of not letting that happen. Yes, it took a little bit for the prompt to fit what I wanted and make the AI stop adding things that I didn't put in, but once I managed to get that, it never happened again. And it's something that I keep an eye out just in case the AI tries to sneak something by. 

This is one of the, in my eyes, best uses for AI we can have as writers. Especially since writing is something that, as you all should know, absolutely wrecks your wrist. Removing the need to be in front of the keyboard typing thousands and thousands of words and just doing the small edits is a godsend.

**Plot Hole Soundboard**

Another, possibly problematic, thing I do is using AI as a soundboard. I basically give my ideas and ask for it to find possible plot holes.

For instance, I had a moment in my story where the main character was invading a laboratory with a group of fighters during a war, but I wanted the main character to fight off the big bad on her own. 

When I gave that plot to the AI, it asked, ""Why is the main character fighting the big bad on her own? There are more people there. They should join the fight."" Which made me realize that I needed a reason for the main character to speed off. Again, the AI did not tell me the reason. 

It just gave me the issue that could arise from the story, and I was the one who fixed it. It works a bit as a alpha reader. Or as having someone to talk about your story. Just someone to give advice. I'm still the one writing. I'm still the creative one. The AI is just being an outside perspective. It would be the same if I asked a friend about it. And if you ask why didn't I do that… I would do it if I had a friend T.T 

  
Jokes aside. Maybe you can't talk to someone at that very moment. Or you are writing something your friends wouldn't enjoy. Or they just hit you with the 'Looks great' and give no feedback. 

**Improving Descriptions**

I also think it's fair to use AI to ask for ways to improve a description or a scene. If you give it the scene and you say, ""Hey, I think this is missing something, what is it? Don't write for me, just say what might help bring this all together."" You're basically using the AI as a way to get advice, without having to have a beta reader or asking for a friend to read it and give the feedback. 

I do agree that this can be sketchy. Especially if you start relying on that kind of thing, and you need to be careful not to be too influenced by what the AI is saying so that you won't lose your own writer's voice. However, I do think that it can be used sporadically, especially because you will, hopefully, start to notice the things you usually miss and stop making those mistakes.

**Checking for Specific Mistakes**

Speaking of mistakes, this is another thing that AI can help a lot with. When you notice that you're making a repeated mistake and you're trying to fix that but you realize that more often than not you miss it and end up posting the chapter without fixing that, you can add to the prompt or just make a specific prompt for that and ask the AI to check for that specific mistake.

  
I'm going to give another example here. 

In my second story, I have a character that is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns. But, while they have a genderless name, it is a name that I personally associate more with women than with men. And it was a bit of a struggle early on to remember that when I was saying Riley (like the girl from Inside Out), I should use they/them instead of *she* when I was voice typing. 

So, I edited my prompt. I made it so it would do two things. One, it would change so the pronouns were always correct. And two, have the AI tell me every instance that I made that mistake. Seeing that feedback helped me notice when I was making the mistake, and right now I barely ever have that issue. Most times when it does happen is because I was initially thinking that a certain character was going to be speaking, when I realized, ""Oh no, this is something that Riley should be saying.""

**Generating Flavor Text**

Lastly, what might be arguably the use that will get me in trouble. In my story, the characters adventure and get items from dungeon runs. While most of them are items that I have considered and thought about and created myself, every now and then there's something where the characters need to pick from a list, or they will get just a bunch of random stuff that they are not going to end up using. 

And I don't want to make items that I really like because I would want them to use it. So, I just asked the AI to make me a few random items on roughly this power level and then edit them to fit the story before posting it. But again, those are more flavor than anything else. I don't remember if I ever actually took a main item from one of those prompts and had the character use it. It is just something to speed up the process. If you use those items, it can make you more flexible as you are adding unplanned things to the story.

# Story Longevity and Content

Now if what I mentioned about AI doesn't make you want to burn me at the stake and you're still interested in what I have to say, let's talk about your story. As I mentioned, my main story has over a thousand chapters and has been going on for more than 5 years. 

My current schedule is 3 chapters per week, but there was a time when I was writing 4. I have a second story that I write another 3 chapters per week. Meaning in total I write and post at least 6 chapters a week. This is a lot and I've learned some things. 

First tip:

**Every Chapter Needs to Have Meaning**

What do you need to do to make a story like this still have content and not end up being just fluff or you milking you Patreons? 

First, you need to understand that no matter the size of your story, every chapter needs to have a meaning. It doesn't have to be a big meaning. Not every chapter needs to be about the end of the world or how the main character's family is about to be killed by the evil monster. But it needs to give the readers something.

It can be a heartfelt moment between two characters. It can be some lore about the world. It can be a slice-of-life moment to cool things off after a hard fight. It can be an upgrade, a new fight, a different type of enemy that they haven't faced before, a new dungeon, a new place, a new spell. It needs to have something, but at the same time, not every chapter needs to be vital.

Here's an example. 

In a specific chapter, I have the main character of my story testing out a new ability. She could create this construct from a weapon, which had sentience and could move around and do whatever they wanted. The restriction was that they couldn't be that far away from the mc. Then, she gets a skill that lets them go on a longer journey. They basically gain their own side quest that they can leave her side to go do. But she's not entirely sure how that works when they're going to dungeons, since in the story dungeons are kind of pocket dimensions.

So she has this construct going to one of those pocket dimensions to see if they're going to be able to go there and back without any problem, or if the amount of mana they have is going to run out and they're going to be destroyed, only to be later recovered after some time passes. 

This is something that I made a whole chapter about, talking about how the construct was feeling, what the differences were between when he was close and he was far away, and how it was to run a dungeon without his creator. It has meaning. It is interesting and it is fun. But it could have been a paragraph. It could have been just a mention that ""she had tested this before back in the floating city and knew it worked,"" when it became relevant she could send them off running dungeons on their own.

Let's use another example. 

On a different scale of importance, I made a chapter about the main group having a movie night. It happened in the main character's new house that was in a place she always dreamed to be. It showed how the main character was still a bit traumatized by a few recent events, and how supportive the rest of the cast was about her current state. It also had a lot of talk about snacks and food, because I was hungry when I was writing it. But that's beside the point. It is something that has value, but it doesn't necessarily have to be there.

And I think that's the main problem for longer stories. Writers tend to fall into a trap of trying to stretch and stretch and stretch, and they don't give the necessary value to each chapter. And that's why I recommend you to always think about at least something important happening in a chapter. Again, various degrees of importance, but it has to be something. If it's a chapter that has absolutely no impact, no meaning, nothing, it should not be a chapter that you have published.

I also say, I don't think I've managed to do that in every single chapter in my story. I do believe there might be a couple of chapters that are basically about nothing and have no meaning. But, it never became a problem. My readers never complain about ""nothing happened here."" Maybe it helps since I try to lean a bit more into the slice-of-life aspect of things. At the same time, there were a lot of chapters where that idea of slice-of-life went out of the window since there were a lot of things happening in the story and we didn't have time to joke around.

Second tip: 

**Keep Detailed Notes**

Another thing that you really need to keep in mind if you're making a really long story is you're going to need to keep some notes. If you're not someone who keeps them, I'm sorry to tell you. You're going to need them. Really long stories get out of hand quickly, especially if you don't keep track of characters, locations, and important information.

So I cannot recommend you enough to have a Doc file, or use Obsidian, use Notion, use whatever works for you and it's easily searchable and keep notes of what's going on. The characters, who they are, where they're from, their appearance. You don't even need to have different descriptions in your story and your notes. Just copy the one you gave in the story and paste it there. Anytime someone mentions something important, copy and paste. Even if the notes are messy, as long as you have them and you can hit Ctrl+F to look for a specific term, it will save you a lot of time and trouble.

I will say Scrivener is great for that because you can search for a term and it's going to look through everything, all the story and all the notes you have, and so is Obsidian. But if you're writing in Obsidian, then you have some problems with formatting. Just don't even try formatting on Obsidian. just format when you paste on the website editor. Because it's not going to work in the program. 

Third tip:

**Write for fun**

This might sound a bit silly, but you need to be writing and enjoying what you write.

I said this earlier, but you are the person who is going to be the most invested in your story. If you don't think it's a good story, if you don't feel like it's something worth reading, neither will your readers. So make sure you're having fun while you're writing.

It doesn't matter if you're writing a comedy scene where you have the equivalent of The Three Stooges on the page, or if you're writing a gut-wrenching moment where the main character loses someone they loved. It needs to be fun. It needs to be enjoyable. It needs to be something that you want to read.

If you're going for a very long story, it's easy to forget those details. It's easy to forget that people are reading because they want to lose themselves into a different world.

We tend to focus on just talking about the world, but that is not always a good call. This is the last example I'll give—and I'm not trying to give any flak to the work I'm about to mention, because I am really enjoying this series. But I was reading Lord of the Mysteries a couple of days ago, and there was almost a full chapter talking about the life of an old emperor who got isekai'd into the world. It was basically talking about all the modern-day advancements he tried to bring to that medieval-like world, but it went too hard on the explanations on how things worked.

I honestly can't even remember exactly what it was talking about because it was just so boring that I zoned out. And I'm not saying that explanations like that are necessarily bad; I'm just using that as an example to say I would think that writing that would be boring. So I would do my best to avoid writing something like that unless it became absolutely necessary to the story, which wasn't really the case.

And if we don't write to have fun, to enjoy the story, then what are we doing?

  
**Monetization and Personal Experience**

Another thing that I think you should consider is money, because let's face it, if you're writing for this long, you want to be paid for your effort. If you don't want to be paid. then that's fine.

If you are unsure and this is your first story, wait until the end of Book 1. I think that's a good moment for you to decide if, ""Yeah, this is something I would like to make a career off,"" or ""have at least as a side gig,"" or if it's something you decide, ""I don't know, this is just a hobby and I don't want to stress myself with that.""

Then, if you want to make money, Patreon is the easiest way to go.  Set it up, put in the author's notes, and that's that.  Just make sure you have a few chapters ahead on patreon so people have a reason for going there. 

Also, when you decide the values of your Patreon tiers, keep in mind that it is extremely hard to increase existing prices. You can do it, but if you're asking for a certain amount for let's say 10 chapters, and all of a sudden you decide to increase the price of those 10 chapters, nine times out of ten there's going to be some pushback, and of those nine times, eight are probably going to go south.

Instead of trying to increase previous tiers, my recommendation is for you to make new, better tiers that are more expensive, or start offering better things for the upper tiers.

# Publishing

Another good way of getting paid is publishing it. I would love to give a bit more advice on that, but since I myself have never been published, I don't know exactly how that works. So I'm not going to even pretend I know what I'm talking about.

And if you're asking why I was never published, it is a mixture of factors, including the fact that my Book One is rough. I am currently working on a rewrite and I intend to relaunch my story soon, but the current state of my first book is not great. And even with all the bad grammar and the lack of experience in writing that I've acquired over the course of these five years, I still managed to get a very good following. And right now I still have over 2,000 followers on the story and consistently get around 1,000 views per chapter over the course of the month.

So, despite my best efforts, my story went pretty damn well so far. And now that I have all this experience and I can see the mistakes I made in the first few chapters, that's why I'm trying to relaunch it and hopefully publish it in the near future.

This was a very long post. To anyone who read it all and felt it was a waste of time, I apologize.

To anyone that felt it could help, great, I hope it does. 

And to anyone just here to fight me because of what I said about AI, meet me in the parking lot of the Waffle House. I don't know which one, we'll figure it out.

But that's it. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to do that, and thanks for coming to my TED Talk.

I’m looking to do something romantic with this storyline, possibly long term. Please keep in mind I’m 28 so no minors. 


August spotted her from the porch of the bunkhouse, sitting alone by the fire pit, the soft glow flickering against the night. Most of the other guests had turned in, leaving the ranch quiet except for the occasional murmur of conversation drifting from inside. She sat with her knees tucked up, staring into the flames like they held something she was trying to figure out. He watched for a moment, then grabbed an extra mug of coffee from the pot inside and made his way over, the gravel crunching beneath his boots.

“Figured you could use something warm,” he said, offering the mug as he stopped beside her. His voice was easy, the way it always was, but there was a quiet curiosity behind it. “Mind if I sit?” He didn’t wait for much of an answer before settling onto the bench across from her, the fire crackling between them. The night stretched wide and open around them, and August took a slow sip of his coffee, letting the silence linger before adding, “You settling in alright?” It wasn’t just small talk—out here, people came looking for something, and he’d been around long enough to know when someone was carrying more than they let on.",4,1762979041.0,Roleplay,2,1.0,False

1ovgcav,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ovgcav/i_think_im_on_the_verge_of_friendship_break_up/,I think I'm on the verge of friendship break up and it's been haunting me.,"I would like to start by saying that english isn't my first language hence just bear with me if there's a few grammar mistakes here and there (and it's gonna be a long post, sorry)

I (F) have a bestfriend (M) and we've been bestfriends for almost 12 years now, we met in elementary school, went to a different middle school, but then got into the same high school again. The most important context here is that I am always the ""therapist"" friend for everyone, I get used to people coming up to me and essentially asking me for advice or simply just rant and I always made sure to at least shows up for everyone and this, including to him.

I would say that our friendships mostly ""rooted"" with him asking me for his relationship advice cause he once stucked in a very unhealthy relationship throughout his teenage years and I'm always there as the listener and encourage him to get out. But other than that, I also have to say that he's such a good friend, he listened to me, he once  accompanied me when I've gone through the most difficult loss and hard time of my life and it helped me a lot like I actually cherished this friendship.

And after high school, we grew quite apart and I'm fine with that cause I know life's changes especially since I went to college that is far from our hometown, we kept in touch from time to time during college, he finally got a new girlfriend which I'm soooo genuinely happy for him, I'm also happy with my college life, we expressed that we're happy for each other, and all seemed fine, right? 

Then fast forward to now, we've graduated from college like almost 2 years ago, I'm back to the hometown, got a remote job for the most part, and he got a job out of town, again, it's understandable if we grew apart cause things got even more busy. Last year he contacted me saying that his girlfriend (that very same one I mentioned before) cheated on him, he called me and we talked, he told me how hurted and sad he was, you know the post-breakup stuffs, but the strange thing is that after that, I sort of felt like he ignored me or avoiding me on purpose.

I asked him to meet up cause I know he'd be back to our hometown every once in a while (his workplace is not very far, like 1-2 hours away from our town) but every time I brought up the conversation, it always ended up in radio silence. Until a few weeks ago I finally asked something like, ""Do you even still want to meet/talk to me? Or what's going on here?"" and that's when he said that he's been feeling sad at the thought of meeting me.

He said and I quote, ""It's just all this time I always come to you when I'm sad, so now I unconsciously associated you with sadness. I know it's my fault but I'm trying to fix this now""

I guess it makes sense???? In a way??? But reading that also somehow makes me really sad??? Or maybe I'm just dramatic like that idk. I tried to talk it out though, asking him how he's doing now, and he said he's been doing a lot better now, he's happier and everything, and I said something like, ""then let's meet, let's talk again, and let's talk about the happy part for once"" but then he just said, ""I just feel like I've been a bad friend to you"" 

I mean I've never said or think of him that way, I still tried to reassured(?) and talked to him about it after that, but he never really gave me a clear answer whether or not he's still wanted to meet/talk to me and when I invited him for a coffee sometime soon or later, he just never replied to my message until this very day.

I guess I just have to give him the time he needed? But also it's saddened me to think someone (let alone my bestfriend) could associate me with the sad part of their life to the point that they can't face me(?) when all I'm trying to do was to show up back then.... It's just really devastating situation all over and   I've been self-conscious about all of my friendships knowing mostly it all started with them coming to me when they're sad or needed company/help/advice. I am now just trying to wait for him to come around or trying to accept the fact that maybe the friendship would be just hanging in a thin rope like this??? Idk man this is sad

It's too long now lol, I'm sorry, I just need to rant it out somewhere cause it's been hard and confusing to navigate.

I want to maximize accruing miles/points for this trip between now, that is, Nov 2025 through Oct 2026 and I want to redeem them for that big special trip by or before October 2026.  This is our first real vacation in over a decade - we've scrimped and saved to make it real.  Travel cards that have annual fees may not offer the best value for us long term, but might work for 2026. We could cancel them.  We do not need access to credit in the foreseeable future – no need for new car loans or new mortgages in the foreseeable future.    What do I do!?! HELP!

* Current cards: (list cards, limits, opening date)
   * Me:
      * (1)Capital One Miles, $7,5000 limit, opened about 10 years ago; 248,458 Capital One Miles on this one.
      * (2)Macy’s Card, $800 limit, opened between 5-10 years ago;
      * (3)TJX Card, I am unsure of the limit, opened 5 months ago.
   * Spouse: Capital One Quicksilver, $7,500, not sure when opened.  Has about $90 in cash back since he regularly draws on it.
* FICO Score: 
   * Me: Credit Score of 823 (as of 11/11/2025 – usually my score takes a digger in January since I utilize my cards more than average to buy for Christmas)
   * Spouse: Credit Score of 805 (as of 11/2025)
* Oldest account age: 
   * Me: 10 years
   * Spouse: Not sure. Probably similar or less.
* Chase 5/24 status: 
   * Me: 1/24  (TJX card opened 5 months ago)
   * Spouse:  0/24
* Income: 
   * Me:   $50,000-$70,000 based on commission/performance; 2025 will be higher than average due to an unusual circumstance.
   * Spouse:   $120,000 – salaried
* Average monthly spend and categories:
   * dining (spouse & me, combined, 12-month average):  $177.91(if you include fast food, coffee, local lunch counters, local pizza, and restaurants) or $75.08 (if you just count restaurants)
   * groceries (spouse & me, combined, 12-month average):  $1,213.66
   * gas (spouse & me, combined, 3 month average): $706
   * travel (spouse & me, combined): *de minimis*
   * other (spouse & me, combined, 3 month average spending less all food and all gas = $2,639.66 - $800 (local childcare must be paid by cash/check not credit card) - $1,839.66.   We buy often from Amazon or Walmart for non-grocery related household spending.  We have Amazon Prime.  We use Verizon for phones.
* Open to Business Cards: 
   * YES.  Spouse has a single member LLC (w/ EIN) for a side hustle- very low revenue and low expenses.
   * YES. I have a sole proprietorship (no EIN) side hustle, also low revenue, low expenses.  In addition, I could pay some my employment expenses (e.g., annual required trainings) personally with a card and seek reimbursement from my employer rather than having employer front them for me in order to maximize points – it would not matter to employer.
* What's the purpose of your next card? 
   * See opening paragraph, above. Spouse and I are planning a trip to Europe (specifically, Italy, Austria & Hungary)  for October 2026.  I want to maximize accruing miles/points for this trip between now, that is, Nov 2025 through Oct 2026 and I want to redeem them for that trip by or before October 2026.  This is our first real vacation in over a decade.  Travel cards that have annual fees may not offer the best value for us long term, but might work for 2026. We could cancel them.  We do not need access to credit in the foreseeable future – no need for new car loans or new mortgages in the foreseeable future.  
* Do you have any cards you've been looking at? 
   * All the travel cards with generous bonus points – for example:
      *  The Capital One Family (what we already have):  Capital One Venture X ($395) & Capital One Venture X Business ($395). The annual fees for these cards are higher than I wish to pay once this trip is done, but the sign on bonus points are pretty attractive.  Could I cancel an annual fee card, then transfer points back to my Capital One Miles Card which has no annual fee?   I understand lounge access will be limited but this isn’t a big deal we travel rarely.   I understand that I can’t refer my spouse or he me to earn a referral bonus because we both already have Capital One Cards, but we can share points between ourselves and between multiple Capital One Cards.  I think the Capital Venture X Business is probably one that I could qualify for based on my personal score, and my history with Capital One, and some assets I hold in a Capital One Savings Account.  I expect maybe staying within the Capital One ""Family"" could be our best strategy?   
      * The Chase Family.  Chase Unlimited (no fee); Chase Ink Business (no fee); Amazon Visa (no fee), paired with a Chase Sapphire Preferred ($95 fee) or a Chase Sapphire Reserve ($795 annual fee), New Chase Sapphire Reserve Business ($795 annual fee).  The sign on points/miles for these cards are attractive. Since neither I nor my spouse have any Chase Cards, I think we’d be eligible for a referral fee.   I expect we might have a harder time qualifying for a Chase Business Card because our businesses have low revenue, and only my spouse’s has an EIN.  I think the strategy might be to cancel the annual fee card after this trip and transfer points to a no fee card.  I understand Chase will allow me and spouse to pool points between different cards within the Chase family of cards.
      * American Express Family. AmexPlatinum (annual fee $895), AmExGold (annual fee $325), AmEx Blue Cash Preferred ($0 first year, $95 thereafter), and then pair or downgrade to a no annual fee card like a Blue Cash Everyday (no fee).   I think the strategy might be to sign up for the welcome points/miles, then cancel the annual fee card after this trip and transfer points to a no fee card. My understanding is Amex won't let us ""share"" points between us, so Amex may be less attractive than Chase or Capital One.  
      * Other?  I think there are pretty good options above with these well-known players, but please me know if I’m overlooking a golden egg.
* Are you OK with category spending, or do you want a general spending card? 
   * Category spending might work especially if I can sell my spouse on the benefits of it for the next 10-11 months.

So, I (F,19) have known this guy (M,19) since 7th grade but we got really close in the last year. We worked together during our gap year between high school and university as volunteer workers. And it was great, we were able to talk to each other about everything and I got so comfortable around him, which is rare for me. There was never anything romantic, I genuinely can’t look at him that way and I’m also in a loving relationship right now. 

It was during this gap year where he also met his current girlfriend, let’s call her Elsie. They became a couple about seven months ago and were so cute. I think she truly brings out the best in him. This all isn’t a problem, obviously- the problems started around two months ago. he stopped responding to texts, taking around 24h to answer every time. Many of our other friends complained about this to me, but while it is annoying, I can’t really blame him for not always being on his phone. But in addition to this, it’s been impossible to see him. Every time we plan something, they both go together. A few weeks ago I planned a meetup with just me, him and a good friend of ours. 
Around a day before, he asks if he can bring his gf, and while I’m a little disappointed, I obviously have no problem with it. 

But it’s this every time. Going partying? Three of us. Drinking coffee? Three of us. And if it’s a larger group you won’t see him at all because he and Elsie always sneak off and are nowhere to be found. I truly respected this relationship. Them being so close rn is because we all now live in the same city for university and he finally has the chance to see her everyday, which he couldn’t before that and I can really understand why he would be with her a lot because of this.

Now to the actual conflict: about two days ago I asked him if he would be with his gf the next few weeks. He said yes and asked me why, so I replied that it had been a while since we got together 1on1. He asked if I had anything to say that Elsie couldn’t hear and I said no, I just wanted to talk with him. He said that we could all do something together and I replied that yes, I’m very open to that but I also missed talking to him like we did in the past year and that I wasn’t comfortable to talk about my problems around Elsie. (Also I added “but if you’d rather do something with me and her together, that’s totally fine”.) He got really mad, since Elsie picked me up from a doctors appointment a week ago  and apparently this should make us close enough to talk about deep stuff, at least according to him.

I explained to him that I really like her a lot but I don’t want to talk about this stuff to people I don’t know enough since I feel like I’d burden them with my feelings. And I said I wanted to talk to my best friend. Which is genuinely the only think I want. I miss him and talking to him, since I have not found any friends this semester. He finally agreed to meet but now I feel bad for what I said. AITA?",0,1762978934.0,AmItheAsshole,53,0.43,False

I'm a 21-year-old female student at the University of Zambia (UNZA) main campus looking to connect with people in my area. I've lived in Woodlands, Prospect Hill, for most of my life, but after boarding school, I've been away for a while. Now that I'm back in Lusaka for university, I'm eager to meet new people and make some friends.

If you're around Ngulube Road, Kapumpe Road, or Chite Road, and are between 20-24 years old (preferably a student too!), I'd love to hear from you! I'm into:

- Binge-watching series (any recommendations?)
- Working out and running (looking for running buddies!)
- Bible studies (open to discussing faith and more)
- Music (all genres welcome!)

My childhood friends have all moved away, so I'm starting fresh. Would be great to meet people with similar interests or just someone to grab a coffee with.

If you're interested, feel free to DM me or comment below!

This year the NY office hired an HR representative that is now his boss, and she is significantly more professional than he is, but somewhat reluctant to get involved with incidents at our office as that is supposed to be his job. The thing is, he is a gossip that is only concerned about being cool with the people he considers his friends, but he even gossips about them. I'm talking both their personal life and any complaints from/about them.   The impression I get is he believes that when people come to him with complaints, it is to gossip and not because he is HR and should be the one to do something about it. So many people have told me they do not report verbal abuse fro management because HR will not do anything about it but make it worse (example telling the manager who said what and hiding it from the upper management.) I once was in his office for a work related question and he received an incident report which he proceeded to show me and talk ish about both people involved. He's also talked to me about how much certain people get paid, along with people taking leave and for what reasons, completely unprovoked. I've also made a complaint to him about verbal abuse from upper management, and later that year a coworker from a different department told me they heard about it. Upper management is aware and even engages in this behavior with him - there was once a report of sexual harassment made against one of HR's friends and he and the COO said a write ur that person would be unnecessary. Keep in mind this same HR manager also once threw a mug of coffee at the controller, the owner was aware, no write up, suspension, no consequences. Someone had reported to the NY HR that our HR manager talks about people's wages, and he was angry, but literally said ""They can't prove it."" I guess my question is - I understand some of this is surely illegal, but I have no concrete proof and upper management doesn't seem to care at all. What should I do?

The rankings are value-adjusted, meaning dollar for dollar which we thought was best.

Rooms:
1. Wildflower Farms
2. Inness
3. DeBruce

The cabins at Wildflower were beautiful and the large windows open to the forest.  Inness has a similar window but strangely they all face other accomodations and roads.  The bathroom at Inness left a lot to be desired and the room needed hooks but they are spacious.  Our room at the DeBruce was cute but very small (however a better bathroom than Inness).  You hear other guests more at the DeBruce because you're in a hotel proper.

Food:
1. Inness
2. Wildflower Farms
3. DeBruce

Dinner at Inness was spectacular and well priced.  We had the entire menu during our stay and loved it.  Lunch/Breakfast were fine.  The dining room and lounge are lovely.  Avoid the drip coffee and the cocktail menu.  Wildflower had some standout items (Szechuan peppercorn steak, for example), and had a much better brunch than Inness, but at a higher price point.  Our friends have raved about the food at the DeBruce but it was a very disappointing series of meals for us.  They were clearly trying to do more creative food but it was mostly a miss for us.  The meal on arrival was communal, which I don't mind being social with other guests but it was extremely long, over two hours, which is a lot sitting beside folks we didn't know.  I did like the lodge bar at the DeBruce best of the three, and it was the best place for a cocktail.

Grounds:
1. DeBruce
2. Wildflower Farms
3. Inness

The DeBruce has a lovely little trail network into the hills and some short jaunts through fields and around a lovely pond (with beavers!).  Wildflower has a small marshy trail which is better than nothing but not special.  When we visited there were huge quantities of yellow jackets and bees around the pool and the outdoor seating at the restaurant.  We were not particularly bothered by this, although I did get stung, but ymmv.  There is essentially no nature walk at Inness, and going from our cabin to the main guest area is on paved roads.  The grounds at Inness are very disappointing and require you to go off property to get in any sort of walk.

Hospitality:
1. Wildflower
2. DeBruce
3. Inness

Wildflower blew these other two out of the water.  Staff was on hand and learned our names very quickly.  Any issue was quickly and pleasantly resolved.  Spectacular from arrival to departure.  The DeBruce was fine but not always present.  If you wanted a tea outside meal time it wasn't always possible to find someone for example.  The fires were lit only at certain times which felt like an oversight.  More of a DIY experience at the DeBruce which is not unreasonable considering the lower price point.  Inness was a big fail.  We arrived after dark, but not late, and in the rain.  The check-in process went very badly for us, not aided by a lack of lit signage for where the check-in is and an unpleasant person at the front desk.  Checkout also went poorly as they ask guests not to drive the road to the cabins (probably because all the guests are walking this road to get around the property).  We called for a car to get our luggage and after thirty minutes it never arrived.  I think it was the same woman from check-in who took our call.  All this said, the staff at the Inness restaurant were lovely throughout.

Spa:
1. Wildflower Farms
2. DeBruce (Hemlock Neversink)
3. Inness

I had the best massage of my life at Wildflower.  The spa is a bright and airy cabin-style space, but not very private.  The DeBruce doesn't have a spa on property but they arranged for us to have a day at their sister property nearby (Hemlock Neversink).  It was fine but I don't think I would go back if we stayed at the DeBruce again.  Inness spa is a damp experience.  The bathhouse is very humid and the water is salty.  When we visited the sauna was out of service but the steam room was working, though my experience would have been better with some sort of aromatherapy in the steam room.  The highlight for me was the heated outdoor pool, very nice in the cold air.  Personally, I could not spend a long time there.

Inness had the most complete gym and Wildflower Farms the most bougie.  No gym at the DeBruce.

Overall:

I won't rank these as I was mostly happy with all the properties and didn't feel one was much better or much worse than any other beyond what I've noted above.  There are often deals as well which could move the needle for you.  On the whole we think the most about the stay at Wildflower Farms but it was also the most expensive of the three by far at the prices we booked.  For guidance we were at Wildflower in the summer and Inness and the DeBruce in the fall.",12,1762978555.0,chubbytravel,0,0.94,False

I'm running a market assessment for a Middle East manufacturer eyeing Saudi Arabia's construction chemicals market. Need someone who can dig through data, make sense of it, and turn it into killer presentations.

**The Gig:**

* Deep dive into Saudi market research (government data, trade stats, industry intel)
* Stalk competitors and figure out what they're doing right (and wrong)
* Transform boring Excel sheets into compelling PPT storylines
* Help size a multi-million dollar market opportunity

**The Deal:**

* **Duration:** 2-2.5 months
* **Pay:** ₹12K/month (+ surprise bonuses if you're good)
* **Hours:** Sunday-Thursday (Saudi timezone - yes, your weekends are Friday-Saturday now)
* **Mode:** Remote

**Why This Beats Your Average Internship:**

✅ Real consulting work, not busy work - actual client deliverables with your name on it  
✅ Learn frameworks that Big 4/MBB consultants use (market sizing, competitive analysis, feasibility studies)  
✅ Direct mentorship from IIM L alum who's done consulting across India, Saudi, UAE  
✅ Portfolio piece that'll make recruiters stop scrolling  
✅ International exposure without leaving your bedroom

**You'll Fit If:**

* You can Google like a detective and actually find useful stuff
* PowerPoint is your canvas, not a chore
* ""Sunday-Thursday"" doesn't make you cry
* You don't need hand-holding every 2 hours
* You think in frameworks, not just copy-paste

**Red Flags (Don't Apply If):**

❌ You think research = Wikipedia surfing  
❌ Your PPTs look like ransom notes (10 fonts, random colors)  
❌ You need reminders to meet deadlines  
❌ ""Saudi timezone"" sounds like a dealbreaker

**The Catch:** This isn't easy. You'll work hard. But you'll walk away knowing how real consulting projects work - from research to final client presentation. That's worth more than the ₹12K.

**How to Apply:**

Drop ""**Interested**"" in comments

Then DM me:

1. Name
2. College & Degree
3. Your best research/PPT project (even academic stuff works)
4. One line on why you won't ghost me mid-project

**Fair Warning:** Expecting high volume. Shortlisted folks get a quick eval test. No fluff, just checking if you can actually do what you claim.

i’ve been dealing with gerd for a while now and it’s honestly wild how much it changes your day-to-day life. like i never realized how much food affects your mood until this. i used to be super carefree about what I ate, pizza, coffee, spicy food, late-night snacks after work, now it feels like i have to think ten steps ahead before every meal.

it’s not even just the physical stuff, it’s the mental part too. i’ll literally be out with friends and everyone’s ordering stuff i used to love, and i’m just sitting there deciding between plain rice or grilled chicken like i’m on some survival show. and the anxiety after eating something “risky” is next level, like waiting to see if i just triggered an attack or if i’m safe for the night.

the only thing that’s been helping a bit is keeping a food log (just in my notes app right now). i’ve started to notice patterns i never would’ve thought of, like even certain teas mess me up, or how stress days make symptoms worse no matter what i eat.

idk, just wondering if anyone else has hit that point where it’s not just about the symptoms anymore, but how much it changes your whole routine. what’s been the hardest adjustment for you guys?",5,1762978506.0,GERD,2,1.0,False

Like most people here, I have my own reasons to post here rather than just creating a profile on an online dating app. I am 30, 6'1 (I swear not rounding it up), I have an average build with a little dad bod. I have two working brown eyes, some cute tattoos and earrings. Financially stable with my day job. By 16:30, I am a musician. I write a lot, sing a lot, and I would love to find someone that I can feel content with. (A very well behaved dog also comes included in the bundle.)

Different friend groups would tell different things about me. While half would say I am really quiet and reserved, the other half will tell you that I am unhinged just with a sip of my morning coffee. They will both agree, I give really good hugs and cook really well. #notions.I am very affectionate, love dark humour and receiving a good song or finding iced tea in the fridge makes me happier than most things would in the world.

I am looking for someone that wants something stable, and serious. Of course, I am more than happy to start as friends, exchange photos, make fun of each other in the right amount before we decide on anything. As long as we are compatible, looks would be the least of my worries. If you are interested, please message me and tell me something about you or a random fact so we can break the ice a tad easier than Ottomans siege of Vienna.

1ovg3wc,https://i.redd.it/ltet7og0wv0g1.jpeg,"I made a daily reminder app that roasts you into action — no toxic positivity, just honesty","Hey Reddit 👋  
I’m a developer who got tired of boring “drink water” reminders,  
so together with my husband we built an app that calls you out for the things you actually forget.

It’s called *Weirdl*, and it sends you one roast a day about real-life neglect —  
like watering your plants, fixing your posture, or finally washing your sheets.

Instead of “You got this!”, you’ll get:  
\-> “Water the plants. They don’t drink coffee like you do.”  
\-> “Your posture is actively defying human evolution.”  
\-> “Maybe it’s time your bedsheets remembered what soap smells like.”

Each roast is a tiny insult disguised as motivation.  
You can collect them, share them, and try to keep your streak alive without crying.

The app’s free + ad-free right now,  
but there’s also a Premium version with extra chaos:  
🔥 access to rare & legendary roasts  
🔥 3 streak saves per month (for when life happens)  
🔥 the ability to reschedule your favorite roasts as future “nudges”  
🔥 customizable share cards with cool backgrounds

Just launched on Google Play — We’d love your honest feedback, new roast ideas, or your favorite things people always forget to do 🔥
