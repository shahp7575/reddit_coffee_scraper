I’m looking to upgrade from my Rancilio Silvia V2 which is getting pretty a bit long in the tooth and Compak K3 grinder setup. My budget’s around $2,000 AUD, and I was all set on the Profitec Go until the sales assistant mentioned she'd prefer the Expobar Office Control. Main reason is wife wants to buy me a 40th birthday present and a machine upgrade sounds like a good deal we can both enjoy.

A bit about my use:

* I make 2 coffees every morning, plus one for my wife.
* Mostly flat whites.
* I’d like something simple enough that my wife can use easily, but still solid and enjoyable for me.
* Size isn't a real issue.
* Purchasing in Australia (Adelaide).

From what I'm told and can understand:

* The Expobar Office Control would be much better for more drinks in a row, is simple and should be mechanically reliable for a long time,
* The Profitec Go has PID temperature control and will give me more adjustability but being a single boiler will be some more work for multiple cups.

I'm pretty ignorant really and have just enjoyed for Rancilio without much thought over the last 5 or so years so any advice from the pros about which way to go would be appreciated! Happy to take any other considerations or options.

Why is it so hard to talk to elderly parents about estate planning, and how do caregivers make “the hard talk” easier?","Here’s a fun question: why can you ask your mom how to get a bloodstain out of a white shirt, but not where her will is?

If you’ve tried to talk to an elderly parent about estate planning, you already know—it’s like asking them to hand over state secrets. The conversation ends with:

* A quick subject change (“Did you hear about your cousin’s neighbor’s dog?”),
* A mysterious mention of “the drawer,” or
* A flat-out *“I’m not dying yet!”* (Mom is 89, but okay).

The problem? Avoiding this talk is costly. Every year, **billions of dollars go unclaimed—$58 billion, to be exact**—because families never knew where the accounts were, who the beneficiaries were, or what Mom and Dad actually wanted. Add in that **70% of Americans don’t have an estate plan**, and you’ve got a recipe for family chaos.

So let’s look at six ways these talks usually fail (and why).

# Six Stories That Sound Way Too Familiar

**1. The Denial Response**  
You: *“Mom, should we update your will?”*  
Mom: *“I’m not dying anytime soon.”*  
Reality check: denial doesn’t make the paperwork magically appear.

**2. The Mystery Drawer**  
Parents swear *“everything is in the drawer.”* That drawer contains expired coupons, old keys, and a 1993 Sears receipt—but not a single legal document.

**3. The “Don’t Worry, Kids Will Sort It Out” Method**  
Translation: the kids will spend years in probate court arguing about Dad’s rusty fishing boat.

**4. The Secret Stash**  
You discover after a funeral that your parent “talked about” a hidden savings account. No one can find it. Add that to the $58 billion of lost money.

**5. The Verbal Will**  
Dad casually promises you the house. Sadly, verbal wills aren’t legally binding. Guess who else thinks they were promised the house? Yep—your siblings.

**6. The Lawyer Avoidance**  
“Lawyers are too expensive,” says Mom. Fast forward two years: the family spends $20,000 in legal fees fighting over her estate.

# Why Parents Resist

If your parents were born between the 1920s–1950s, they grew up with the unspoken rule: you don’t talk about money, death, or family business. For them, silence equals dignity. For you, silence equals total chaos when it’s time to settle their affairs.

# What Caregivers Don’t Realize

Even if you’re ready to bring it up, here are a few things most caregivers don’t know:

* **Beneficiaries expire.** Dad’s life insurance still names his ex-wife from 1978. Oops.
* **Verbal promises mean nothing in court.** If it’s not signed, it doesn’t count.
* **Power of attorney isn’t optional.** Without it, you can’t legally handle bills or medical decisions.
* **Passwords matter.** Bank logins, email, even Netflix. No access = no control.
* **The state doesn’t care about “favorite child” status.** Without a will, the state decides who gets what. Spoiler: it won’t be fair.
* The Hard Talk Made Easy

Caregivers, here’s the truth: estate planning isn’t about death—it’s about life. It’s about protecting your parent’s wishes, reducing family stress, and making sure the money they worked for doesn’t disappear into probate or state coffers.

Avoiding it doesn’t make it less awkward—it just makes it ten times worse later.

So take a deep breath, pour the coffee, and start the talk. If your parents survived polyester bell-bottoms, typewriters, and Jell-O molds, they can survive one honest chat about their will.

Usually that game has its viewers in the high 400s in the evening (for me) with it dipping down into the double digits in the morning hours.

I'm trying to stream for 3 hours Tuesday and Thursday when I have days off and once on the weekend, and these numbers plus what feels better for me personally will be what decides if I go with morning or night streams.

So is it better engagement to go live when there's more or less viewers? Less means there's probably fewer people online both live and as viewers, while more means people are off work to catch the stream but also there's more competition. I generally have more energy in the morning when I have my coffee, that helps me be animated and talkative vs. my usual taciturn behavior.

1o0wfk4,https://youtu.be/BLoOPBgT7DY?si=au6qyxEcQTzfndvh,Was this a Biased Review of the KF8 vs. Eletta Explore? I'LL Break it Down for You,"First let me say. I have nothing against De'Longhi machines and they are just as good as any other superautomatic in it's class. Some folks will think they are better and some will think they are worse. It's a very opinionated subject. You can also have very different experiences based on coffee beans used and the settings you use.

I am going to share why no one should use this video as a reference to which is better. Not saying that some folks will definitely like the Eletta Explore better, but I will show you why the Kitchenaid was nerfed in this video either on  purpose or maybe unintentional.

They set the actual grinders to match each other they say. Which means they set the actual grind size to be equal, right? NOPE! They set the grinder number to be equal. What! How do you set the grind number to the same setting for two different machines made by two different companies? Since the Eletta Explore cannot usually go below 3.5 or 4 without choking the machine, they decided they needed to use the same setting on the Kitchenaid. This makes absolutely no sense! Since the De'Longhi can choke the machine (which is strange to have all these useless settings under 3.5 on a superauto grinder) they dialed it in to the finest grind for the Eletta Explore. One would think they would then dial in the Kitchenaid to the finest setting which would be a setting of 1 or 2, but since the Eletta Explore can't go that low, they thought it would be unfair to set the Kitchenaid that low? Did they not realize you cannot dial in the Kitchenaid grinder based on the Eletta Explore grinder settings? A setting of 4 or 5 on the De'Longhi is not equal to a setting of 4 or 5 on the Kitchenaid. On the Kitchenaid, that is a pretty course grind.

Moving on to the espresso test, knowing the grinder is set to a coarser setting and already set up for failure, they do a 2oz shot on the Kitchenaid. I weighed a 2oz shot on my Kitchenaid and got almost 57 grams out. That is about a 4:1 ratio shot. That shot in no way is going to be intense, full bodied, or deliver any nuances as an espresso shot. It's going to be mellow, thin, and not strong. That's obvious. For an intense shot, you should be pulling a 2:1 which based on dose size of the Kitchenaid, should be about 30 grams out. For me, that is setting my shot to 1oz. If I made someone a 2oz shot on my Kitchenaid with the grinder set to 4 or 5 and also a 1oz shot with the grinder set on 2, you would think I made you two drinks from two completely different machines. They will be no where close to each other in flavor and intensity. 

Now for the temp of the espresso. After they taste the De'Longhi, they say how much hotter it is over the Kitchenaid. Well, yeah. They set the temp to the highest setting on the De'Longhi but lowered the temp to medium on the Kitchenaid! Was this done on purpose or accident? I don't know the answer to that but clearly the Kitchenaid can deliver a hotter espresso shot by raising the temp to high.

Now, on to the cappuccino. I won't address all the other settings again as they are still using a course grind setting on the Kitchenaid and a 2oz espresso shot, but this time they did raise the Kitchenaid temp to high, but nerfed another setting this time. On the De'Longhi, they set the intensity to the highest setting, but this time on the Kitchenaid they lowered the body from strong to medium. Why would they do this? Was it on purpose or just another oversight? I don't know the answer to that but you can draw your own conclusions.",1,1759884141.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

Of course, that is a high bar to ask for I'm Still Sisyphus because that story takes more effort for every sentence then, say, Conventional ways, so I'll be happy with just a few hundred. I'll do my best.

While I did relax, I did get a few things done today. I helped mother go through some of the junk piled up in the closet of my office. Most of that stuff is hers so I didn't do much but it is a start. The office isn't too big so I didn't get to organizing the actual office while she was doing all that. I most just carried stuff and told her if there was anything I did not want her to sell. Tomorrow, if it is again not nice enough to go out, I'll actually go up and clean. Most of my time was spent cutting up produce for the freezer. The garden is finally prolific, almost overwhelmingly so. We'll definitely have enough frozen peppers to last the winter.

Now, I am going to relax for a little while longer and then make myself a coffee before settling down to write. Wish me luck. Here's hoping I can at least get a semi-decent 400.

When SLU-PP-332 first hit the research scene, it was hailed as the holy grail of exercise mimetics — a compound that could, in theory, activate many of the same pathways triggered by physical training without the mechanical strain of exercise itself. The idea was thrilling: increase mitochondrial biogenesis, boost fat oxidation, improve endurance, and protect against metabolic decline, all from a molecule that mimics the effects of movement at the genetic level.



But somewhere along the way, the industry shrank the vision — and the dosage.



Most versions of SLU-PP-332 on the market today are offered in *micrograms* per capsule, barely scratching the surface of what preclinical studies suggest is effective. The result? Inconsistent results, disappointing feedback, and a growing perception that the compound simply “doesn’t do much.”



BioLongevity Labs decided to challenge that assumption — and the outcome is **ShredMAX**, a 100 mg SLU-PP-332 formulation designed to bridge the gap between laboratory data and human-scale research.



# From Micrograms to Meaningful Exposure

To understand why a 100 mg dose makes sense, you have to go back to the animal research. In multiple preclinical studies, SLU-PP-332 demonstrated its strongest effects at *high relative doses* — 50 mg/kg twice daily in some rodent models — leading to marked improvements in fat oxidation, endurance, and insulin sensitivity.



If you try to extrapolate that to a human system using standard body-surface-area scaling, a microgram-level dose is nowhere near enough to approximate similar receptor engagement or systemic exposure. It’s like taking a single sip of coffee and expecting the alertness of four espressos.



BioLongevity’s 100 mg capsule isn’t just higher for the sake of marketing. It’s an intentional attempt to match *biologically plausible exposure* — something that reflects real-world metabolic activation potential rather than theoretical trace stimulation.



# Overcoming the Bioavailability Barrier

Even if you take a well-formulated SLU-PP-332 capsule, the compound has to survive digestion, pass through the liver, enter circulation, and reach target tissues like skeletal muscle, liver, or heart. Each of those stages trims down the amount of active compound that actually reaches receptors.



If your starting dose is too small, almost nothing makes it to the finish line.



A 100 mg dose provides the necessary “pharmacokinetic cushion” — overcoming loss from absorption and metabolism so enough of the compound can actually activate the **estrogen-related receptors (ERRα and ERRγ)** responsible for mitochondrial and metabolic effects.



# Receptor Activation: The Threshold Problem

Most biological systems work on thresholds, not linear progressions. Turning on a receptor system like ERR signaling requires a critical mass of molecules binding to their sites.



Below that level, you might get some engagement — enough to look good on paper — but not enough to trigger downstream transcription of genes involved in energy production or fat metabolism.



BioLongevity’s approach aims to ensure receptor saturation, driving genuine pathway activation rather than faint signaling noise. The result is a dose more likely to yield consistent, system-wide effects — not just in muscle, but also in the liver, kidneys, and heart.



# A Broader Metabolic Footprint

Low-dose SLU-PP-332 might activate metabolism in accessible tissues like the gut or bloodstream, but higher exposure extends the effect deeper — into less-perfused, energy-intensive organs that drive whole-body performance and aging resilience.



This broader footprint is crucial for longevity research, where mitochondrial health, inflammation control, and cellular energy efficiency are system-wide phenomena. A compound that reaches those deeper tissues has a much greater chance of producing visible results.



# Accounting for Real-World Variability

Not all users are the same. Age, diet, stress, sleep, microbiome health — these all influence how compounds are absorbed and metabolized. In a population with variable metabolic function, a microdose might work for some, but fail entirely for others.



A higher-dose approach like BioLongevity’s 100 mg ShredMAX hedges against that variability, ensuring a baseline level of effectiveness across a broader range of individuals and experimental conditions.



It’s not about overloading the system; it’s about meeting the real-world challenge of biological diversity.



# Setting a New Standard in the Market

SLU-PP-332’s potential has always been immense — but it was trapped in sub-therapeutic formulations. By stepping up to a human-scale dose, BioLongevity Labs isn’t just releasing a new product; they’re redefining the conversation around peptide-like exercise mimetics.



A 100 mg capsule makes the research meaningful again. It acknowledges what the science has been hinting at all along: that *intensity matters*.



Micrograms may have been a safe starting point for curiosity. Milligrams — especially at the 100 mg level — are where real exploration begins.



# A Necessary Note on Caution

Of course, bold experimentation comes with responsibility. High-dose SLU-PP-332 has not been evaluated in human clinical trials, and safety data remain limited. Researchers should approach it with rigor, monitor biomarkers, and document outcomes carefully.



But if the peptide world has taught us anything, it’s that progress often begins where comfort ends — and ShredMAX represents exactly that inflection point.



# The Bottom Line

If SLU-PP-332 truly is the future of metabolic and endurance optimization, it deserves to be tested at a dose capable of demonstrating its potential.

I’m 40 now, but honestly, I probably should’ve started at 30. My diagnosis: severe sleep apnea, with 57 events per hour. I’m only four days into using the CPAP, but I have to share my immediate reaction so far.

The first morning, my body didn’t even know how to process what was happening. No pounding headache when I woke up. No desperate reach for coffee—something I used to rely on, drinking at least four cups a day. Now? I don’t even crave it. I used to yawn constantly; now I’m shocked if I catch myself yawning once in the afternoon.

Another unexpected change—my appetite has dropped drastically. I used to snack throughout the day just to keep my energy up, but now I barely feel hungry. It’s strange, maybe even a little concerning, but I think my body is finally running on real rest instead of caffeine and adrenaline.

I also feel more alert—my senses feel sharper. For years, I struggled to breathe clearly through my nose, and now I can actually smell again. My jaw doesn’t ache anymore, and I no longer wake up with that heavy, bruised feeling in my body—the one that used to remind me how hard my body fought just to survive the night.

My mood has completely shifted. It sounds strange, but I feel calm—comfortable in my own skin for the first time in years. I’m not restless or fidgety. It’s remarkable how much difference real, restorative sleep makes.

I’m hooked. The only challenge right now is improving my MyAir score—it’s hovering in the high 70s to low 80s. I can only imagine how incredible I’ll feel when I finally hit a perfect 100",4,1759883835.0,CPAP,1,1.0,False

My boyfriend passed away about a year ago, and before he died he gave me this custom book of The Song of Achilles as a birthday gift. It has hand painted edges from an Etsy artist, and was signed by the authorHe even wrote a note to me  inside the cover.
My friend L knew all of this. She’d been asking to borrow it for monthsand I finally said yes because I didn’t want to seem rude . I originally recommended she maybe buy her own book but she got upset saying I know she’s unemployed and she can’t afford to do that . For reference she will not sign up for a library card because she does not have a drivers license to get herself there. After she kept begging, I got tired of it and told her it was sentimental and to please be careful with it.

When she gave it back the cover had a faint coffee ring and she annotated the entire thing in bright purple pen. Not smart or meaningful notes either it was more like random paragraphs about her ex doodles underlines and random notes like “this part reminds me of me and Jason lol.” She also dogeared multiple pages! I understand wanting to annotate a book but I just don’t think it’s ok with a book someone else is letting you borrow. She also kept the book in the bottom of her bag where it was really beat up.

I told her she ruined it, and she laughed And told me it’s just a book. She said she “made it more special because it had notes form a friend and now it looks like it’s actually been read ” and that my boyfriend “would have loved how passionate she was about it.” (he was studying for an English degree) I told her that was completely out of line and that I wanted her to replace it.

She snapped back that I was being selfish and I only wanted money. She said the book is fine and I can still read it. I said I didn’t care about money, I just wanted her to take responsibility or at least try to replace it. She said that it wasn’t even available anymore and told me to “let it go.”

Now some mutual friends are saying I overreacted and that I’m projecting my grief.

2.If it’s the grind size, what size do you recommend?

3.Do you have any other coffee suggestions that can really wake me up (especially during review season) aside from Trung Nguyen?

4.If the problem is the phin filter, can you suggest other affordable brands? Or should I just buy the ₱500 coffee maker from Simplus instead?

Specifically, reg and audit engagement within my firm's Fixed Income management group. Honestly am super happy so far, the work is alot more engaging than I was expecting. Obviously audit and reg stuff isn't the sexiest but I've enjoyed how I've been able to learn about a ton of desks in a short time through our work. The role I landed wasn't my first choice - I initially interviewed for another role in our group but they wanted someone more junior for that one and they hired me for this one instead. I was desperate to leave big4 and I'm really glad I made the jump. I am really happy with my team and manager, and the work so far has been fast paced and has taught me a shitton about the business and different desks we cover within Fixed Income.

However, my long term interests definitely are in something closer to the revenue generation in Fixed Income, whether that be sales, trading, structuring, or one of the COO teams. I am studying for my SIE and will look to take my other series exams when I'm able. I've already spoken to a lot of people that have made similar jumps from my team to various desks in some capacity, so I know internal mobility is 1. possible and 2. not frowned upon.

I worry that I might be a bit too old for that jump (I came in as a senior associate, and I don't have an MBA or anything like that) but at the same time I've already met VPs who have done similar jumps and are alot older than me. I've made a goal to set at least one coffee chat per week with VPs and MDs across the desks who I've been working with to slowly build my network and get a feel for where my interests lie. I also don't want to seem too eager to want to leave roles so am being pretty discreet when they ask me during our coffee chats what I want to do longer term.

Through my work I'm going to keep working closely with pretty senior strats and people across desks through reg initiatives and will get good exposure through that, but wanted to ask for what additional advice you'd give me to help slowly position myself in a way where this kind of jump would be possible.",1,1759883506.0,FinancialCareers,1,1.0,False

I’ve gotten really good at entertaining myself, staying busy, finding little moments of joy. My days are full of music, work, walks, silly and educational videos I make just because something feels beautiful in the moment.

But tonight, there was this ache I didn’t see coming. “Don’t Look Down” by San Holo came on while I was driving home to an empty house, and I don’t know… maybe it was the timing, maybe it was the lyrics, maybe it was just the quiet honesty of it… but I felt every word.

> “Don’t look, don’t look down. Stars still shine after they burn out. When all of your doubts turn skies into clouds again. Don’t look, don’t look down when life gets too loud.”

That song has carried me through some of my heaviest days this past year. It’s simple, but there’s something so grounding about it, like it’s whispering, “you’re okay,” even in the in-between.

Still… I found myself emotional tonight. I realized I’ve been creating all these little pieces of my life — videos, music, poetry, snapshots, stories — but I haven’t shared them with anyone. They just sit on my phone, these moments that no one else sees. It hit me how strange it feels to be so full, so capable of joy and love, and yet still feel this quiet emptiness.

I think what I’m craving isn’t attention or validation — it’s connection.

The real kind. The kind where someone knows how you take your coffee, what songs make you soft, when you need silence and when you need to be held.

I want those simple human things. Giggling over inside jokes, lying under someone’s arm as the world softens for the night.

I want those quiet end-of-day conversations that make the world feel soft again.

Everyone around me seems to be finding it so easily, and I know my time will come.

But tonight… it’s not that night. 

Tonight, it just feels like a gentle ache. The kind that reminds you you’re human, that you still have a **lot** of room to love and be loved.

And still, that song kept playing, whispering:

> “It gets better, keep your head up.”

So that’s what I’m doing.

I’m keeping my head up. I’m choosing to trust that the kind of love I’m looking for will meet me when it’s meant to. And until then, I’ll keep creating, keep dancing, keep believing that somewhere out there, someone will see me, **really see me**, and think, *finally, there you are.*",1,1759883378.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

I've been following a barista on TikTok (username: stephmcea0v) who makes amazing coffee content, supposedly streaming live from China. However, I'm starting to suspect this isn't the original account, and someone is reposting this barista's content.

Why I think it's not original:

- The username seems randomly generated (stephmcea0v)
- There's NO information about the actual barista in the profile
- The account is getting very viral and receiving lots of donations/gifts

What i know 

- The cafe is called ""Miiix Coffee"" (with double 'i') - a real coffee chain with locations in Shanghai and Shenzhen, China
- The barista mat shows ""Three Lives Just For Coffee"" which may be related branding or a slogan
- The original content is definitely on Douyin (Chinese TikTok) - there are viral searches specifically for ""Miiix Coffee Shanghai Live""
- This barista/cafe is very popular and does livestreams in China


Many people are donating money to this TikTok account thinking it's the original creator, but I believe the real barista might not be receiving any of this support.

I've taken several screenshots from the livestreams showing:

- The Miiix Coffee branding on bags and equipment
- The ""Three Lives Just For Coffee"" barista mat
- Chinese text on packaging (记得放吸管 - ""Remember to add straw"")

Has anyone seen this barista on Douyin? I don't have access to the app and would love to find the original Miiix Coffee account to support the actual creator. Can anyone help identify:
- The original Douyin account for Miiix Coffee or this specific barista
- If this is an official Miiix Coffee account or a specific barista from one of their locations
- Any way to verify if the TikTok account is stealing content

Any help tracking down the real account would be greatly appreciated!

I always thought cheating would be a boundary I couldn't get past. We have been together nearly 30 years and have a large number of children, Ive been a stay at home mum for most of this time. About 7 years ago, my husband had an emotional affair with another woman. It was all through text and phone, so nothing physical. It felt like I had been physically punched in the chest. I never understood until then that you could feel physical pain from an emotional betrayal. I chose to forgive him and work at our marriage, to do otherwise at the time would have destroyed my entire world and my children's. In a sense I was trapped financially, as the alternative to saving the marriage was not something I felt I could do with a lot of small kids on my own and no income. So maybe that decision wasn't entirely made for all of the right reasons? I don't regret it though, I did what I needed to do for my kids, for myself. I have never fully trusted him again though. 

Two days ago, after we had been spending an enjoyable time together, he randomly told me he wanted to leave. It was a complete shock, as he had been just cuddling and telling me he loved me, and then suddenly like a light switch, he wants to leave. And then he drops to bomb that he kissed another woman. He went out to coffee with her, and then kissed her. He has had no contact with her since then. But apparently it made him realise there were other options.  So now he wants to leave so he can sleep with other women. He never got to experience that before (neither did I, we were each other's first and only). Three decades together, multiple children, and he wants to leave because he wants to be able to have sex with someone not me. I don't argue with him. I do ask him if there is any chance we could work on our marriage and figure out what is wrong and try and fix things. he is adament 'no'. He doesn't place any blame on me at all, he is clear about him knowing that there is nothing I could have done or could do differently or better. I had felt him disengaging at times over the past couple of months but whenever I asked he just said he was stressed about work (which I know it true). But there was not other indicators, even with hindsight that things were truly that far off track. I wonder if this is what a midwife crisis is...

I leave to go elsewhere for a few hours to process what Ive been told. It's like Ive been punched in the chest all over again. I don't want my marriage to end. I feel like I deserve better then all of this. And despite our troubles in the past, this just felt like it came out of nowhere. The fact he wanted to leave hurt even worse then knowing he had kissed someone else. I guess because I always had in the back of my mind that if someone will cheat once, they will probably cheat again? I don't know. 

I ended up asking him to come to me and we talked about the logistics of what separating would look like. I remained very calm and matter of fact through most of the discussions, but did need to step away to breath through panic attacks a couple of times. Through out he was adament that he wasn't willing to try and fix things. I calmly told him that I thought he was being an idiot and a coward, that he was running away rather then trying to work on whatever was really going on. But that I am not going to try and force him to do anything, I don't want to be with someone who isn't even willing to try. I also told him that I think he will regret it, maybe not immediately, but when the bright and shiny veneer of a new relationship wears off, that he will be left facing whatever issues he has now, only he will be with someone who doesn't know him like I do, and probably won't support him like I have. That I have been through everything with him, that not one single person knows him better then me in the world, and vice versa. And he would eventually regret leaving, and then it would be too late. 

We agreed to continue living together and keeping up pretences until after Christmas - we have some major family and children's events and milestones happening, and they are my first priority. I told him we need to handle this carefully and together, or he risks alienating and possibly damaging his relationship with some of our older children (I know these kids, if a few of them get any whiff that he has 'caused' this they won't forgive him. He is a good dad and they love him, and I don't want that to change regardless, but they are fiercely protective of me). We have a plan to seperate, a plan for asset division, for custody, for how I will manage financially. And it didn't even take more then a couple of hours. Of course he has probably been thinking about this for a while... 

He goes out to a function that evening, and I am back home with the kids. When he comes home and the kids are all in bed, he come in and tells me he is sorry, he made a mistake and I am right, that he has thought about what I've said and he does want to work on our marriage. I told him if we are going to do this, I need a commitment, a timeframe; where he won't step outside the marriage or talk to other women, where he actively tries and where I don't have to wake up every morning wondering if today's the day he's finally leaving. We agreed on 12 months time. In the meantime we will work on the relationship and focus on reconnecting, on communicating one spending time together. And during that time we are also going to be sorting out some assets and finances, because I don't want to just stick my head in the sand and pretend everything will work out when I have no guarantee he won't just end up leaving anyway. Given how impulsively he make decisions that impact our entire lifes, I think I would be stupid not to plan ahead.

I have encourage him to get counselling. He is resistant to couples counselling (I think he is worried that they will just point out everything he has done wrong), but I have encouraged him to at least get individual counselling for himself, I suspect he may be depressed to be honest, but whatever is bugging him that he turns to other women for and won't share with me, he needs someone to talk to who he isn't then going to get infatuated with. Because that's how both this affair and the old affair started. He just wanted someone to talk to, I suspect about me, since he doesn't want to tell me specifics. 

So now I'm in this weird limbo land, where I still sn head over heels for my husband, but feeling like I'm less then. That maybe I am doing to wrong thing by forgiving him twice. But the idea of being without him hurts me so much more then even the though of him cheating on me. I have been with him for most of my life, and a I don't want to be without him. I don't know if I can ever fully trust him again, but I know him so well that even where I can distrust him is somewhat predictable (that probably doesn't even make sense to anyone reading). I know that he never sets out to hurt me, that he would never intentionally hurt me, but he makes stupid and impulsive decisions sometimes, because it's easier then facing up to something else. And the truth is I cannot ever see myself trusting anyone else. So any future relationship would already be coloured by the same mistrust, regardless of whether its warranted or not. 

Maybe I'm delusional. Maybe if I was stronger I would just walk away. But he is my best friend. I want to grow old with him. I want to travel with him. I want to enjoy our grand kids together. I don't want to do it alone, and I have no interest in doing it with anyone else. 

But how to I move on. How do I reconcile myself, sleeping with someone I now worry if thinking about someone else whilst we are together.  How do I let go of the fear that me forgiving a second time might be viewed as permitting the behaviour.  That I am setting myself up to be hurt a third time. That's why I always used to believe it was such a firm boundary. 

Sorry for the saga. I have left so much out, so much that impacts my decisions and reactions, but how do I sum up 30 years of a relationship? I want another 30 years. I don't want it to be over. So how do I move on?

Unending warmth followed by an abrupt cold ran across my body. The shadows danced around me. Was it one or many? My head begins to get heavy, the weight pulling it back into the earth. The shadows leave my eye sight and all I see is the bright moon. I feel the ground shudder underneath me. An earthquake? No. I feel it on me. My eyes are fixated on the white moon until it is eclipsed by another shadow. The blackness. The yellow eyes. The Void.

My head violently whipped against the passenger side door as I tried to regain my sight and senses. My head had been propped on the palm of my hand when it fell off and shook me awake as a result of an overly aggressive speed bump. I don’t know for how long I had been asleep, but it was the kind of quality of sleep that I assume Vietnam soldiers had buried deep behind enemy lines in the jungle.  After the white noise subsided and my senses were regained, I turned to the driver side of Danny's 2021 Nissan Rogue to see him with the laser focused stare of a surgeon performing surgery on a newborn on the twisting back country road. If only he didn’t have the grace of a raging bull in a nursery while behind the wheel. The sun reflected off his glasses meeting my eyes, momentarily blinding me.

 The surrounding sound began to also come back to me. I could hear the Interstellar soundtrack begin its 5^(th) playthrough, while in the back I can hear the bickering of Pablo and Ivan, switching between Spanish and English with an ease that I can only relate to through my own stuttering speech impediment and the typical mumblings of my words. Something about crypto or what they should message a girl on one of those dating apps, both of which I have a severe lack of knowledge in.

 “Oh shit I'm sorry Evan, That speed bump came out of nowhere I swear. Are you okay?” Danny said in a genuine apologetic tone. His eyes quickly turned from the road to meet my gaze and then snapped back in front of him. We all knew the anxiety he had while driving, especially on a road where one jerk of the wheel would mean cascading down in a ball of fire off the cliffside. But he's the one that had the space and offered to drive. We weren’t going to argue.

 “Youre okay, I think I was just in a weird position while sleeping, my neck is killing me” I said while slowly rolling my head in circles in an effort to reduce the stiffness.

 “Well I think we are almost there anyways. I haven’t been here before but my dad told me that the water is crisp as hell this time of year. He was here around this time last year” Pablo said as he pulled his torso from the back seat to the front to meet Danny and me.

 “Apparently, there was a huge storm that hit the area at the beginning of the year. Like an absurd amount of lightning strikes and flooding hit that caused a lot of damage to the surrounding area. I think we will be one of the first people to go back to the lake”.  He was the youngest of the group of four, but had the best paying job and was the biggest in size. We would absolutely hate him if we didn’t know him and knew that he would kill anyone for who would threaten us and support us in every life choice we made. 

 “How the fuck did you afford a lake house Pablo? Didn’t you just go to Hawaii earlier this year?” Ivan asked as it was a question that we were all thinking but didn’t know if it was socially acceptable to ask. Good thing Ivan operates on an ask first apologize later code.

 “Dude, you know I got credit card points” which invoked a synchronized eye roll by everyone. If we were to calculate the total amount of time that Pablo has discussed his ‘points’ with us, it would take the duration of this four hour drive.

We were headed to this private lake house that sat on supposedly ‘The Quietest Lake in the World’. I don’t know what governing body bestowed that honor, but it was enough to pique our interest. Based on the information that Pablo’s dad gave him, we will be the only people within a 20 mile radius, as other campsites won’t be able to access the lake without a decent hike through the forest and paying a hefty fine if caught. That also led to the appeal and price of the location. 

 The hot Texas sun shone through the windshield when it pierced through the thick trees that surrounded the one winding road. How was it Fall and still 90 degrees? 

Thank God I am getting out of this state.

This had been the inception of this weekend trip. I had just accepted a job as a field marketing agent for a well known business that has me based out of Michigan.  The entire idea was pitched by Pablo as a going away party for me, however I suspect it was mostly an excuse for all of us to get drunk and swim throughout the weekend. But I can't lie, I wouldn’t want to do anything else with anyone else. I'm going to miss them. We had all met in college while competing in club sports. All of us are athletic in our own right, just not to the division 1 standard. But we bonded over analyzing movies, triathlon training, lamenting (or bragging if you were Pablo) about the girls we asked out, and through coping with each other's own personal tragedies.

Throughout our college years we have each experienced our own form of world ending disasters, from breaking up with girlfriends, to traumatic bike accidents, from losing pets to losing family and friends. My junior year of college I had lost my brother to suicide. It came with the abruptness of a car smashing into me in the middle of the sidewalk and left me paralyzed as such. I was a shell of myself for weeks, ignoring helping hands and thoughtful texts. It wasn’t until they all showed up to my door and forced themselves into my apartment and told me that they weren’t going to leave me to deal with this alone. I broke down in front of them with tears of appreciation and love. Yeah, I am going to miss them.

 These thoughts were interrupted by the heated debates from the rest of the car as to which Golden Girl they would rather do unspeakable things with…in great detail. I stuttered my way to an eloquent and concise stance as to why Rose is the only right answer.

 The road finally came to a clearing to display a wooden lake house that sat 200yds away from the lake's edge. The water glistened an almost blinding blue as the sun reflected off its stillness. It was expansive, the largest lake that I have ever laid eyes on. How it is this big yet still calm and serene is beyond me. Horizontally from one end to the other, it must have been a mile or so, as I can barely see the other end in the distance, just a speck on the horizon. Surrounding the lake opposite of the house was a cliffside of light brown rocks that peered over 20 ft or so above the water. It looked like a horseshoe with the inner “U” being the water. We were about 400 miles away from the nearest big city, with only a string of small towns and gas stations providing the closest pieces of civilization. The lake house that we were occupying was the only building in the whole vicinity. This resulted in a quietness in the air, the humming of the seasonal insects and the occasional ripple in the water providing the only contributions to the sound. 

The house itself went for a vintage style cabin with one story, four rooms and a living room that bled into the kitchen. Facing the house there was a smaller building connected to the right side, when I asked Pablo about it, he said that may be the tool shed. You could tell the refurbishments were up to date and well maintained as it looked like a cabin that had sat there for decades at first glance, but upon closer inspection you can see the clean and fine details. Between the lake house and water sat three long logs on top of the sand surrounding a fire pit, where I assume we will be doing pitch perfect karaoke later tonight. I would have thought that it was still too hot to get a fire started, but was it just me or did it feel cooler?  As if the humid 90 degrees that we have all grown to tolerate now felt about 10 degrees cooler. I am typically not one to be awestruck by nature, but I did notice that my jaw was rolling on the floor.

 I hate to admit it, but thank God for Pablo's points.

 The lake itself was what left us frozen in place. We have all been swimmers, the rest of them since high school and myself since I started college eight years ago, and swam in our fair share of questionable open water. From lakes that were so congested that we couldn’t see past our elbow in the water to lakes that left us trudging through seaweed and other runoff from a nearby goat farm. This lake had an allure that I could feel pulling me from my core. I felt it beckon me to its calm waters, engulfing myself in its embrace. It both excited me…yet…

 “Holy… shit” Danny exclaimed as he opened the door and took a step towards the lake, eyes widened. “How in the world have I not known about this spot?”

 I snap from my brief hydro hypnotization.

“Yea dude I couldn't even look it up, I had to ask my Dad to ask his boss about it. Apparently my dad’s boss and the guy who owns this place golf together. The owner is some millionaire who rents out this place for passive income. I think he's into fracking?” Pablo said as he began unloading the bags and beers from the back

 “Well, I cant f-f-f-f-fracking believe how nice it is-s-s-s-s-s” I squeaked out as I grabbed my bag and walked towards the lake house. I heard the collective moans and felt everyone’s judgmental stares shooting holes into the back of my head from my admittedly cringe inducing pun. My eyes held the stare of the lake for as long as I could.

 “There are no girls here, who are you trying to impress?” Ivan said as he caught up with me. I noticed he was also holding the gaze of the lake as well. I wonder if he felt the overwhelming pull of its call.

 As we finally unloaded all the contents of the car and settled into each of our respective rooms, we all congregated in the living room of the house, with Pablo and Danny sitting on the chairs that sat opposite of the coffee table on each side while I sprawled on the couch that sat parallel to the length of the coffee table. Ivan stood behind me as we discussed what we were going to do first. Danny offered to cook food, Pablo suggested getting the fire started, I threw out taking a nap, but after a few minutes of lackluster ideas, we all knew what we wanted to do.

 We decided to go for a swim.

 We quickly changed into our swimming attire which consisted of performance jammers, swim cap, and goggles. As we breached the water's undisturbed layer, jumping from the dock that sat a few yards from the house and that floated 5ft from the blissful water , we were greeted with a cooling sensation that engulfed our entire bodies. In stark contrast to the blistering sun that has burdened us for over half of the year to this point, the water couldn’t be any cooler. The air in my lungs immediately evacuated with an aggressiveness that forced me to sprint to the surface so that I could breathe again. The small panic subsided as I saw my friends also come back to the surface. The lake felt larger than what I thought just peering at it from the shore. From where we were, the other side of the lake, where the peaceful waters are met with a tall cliffside, had to be close to half a mile. We all decided to swim to the end and back, getting in a solid mile of swimming. I began to adjust to the cool water and I was able to take in my surroundings. As everyone else began to swim forward, I felt a pulling sensation beckoning me to turn around and look underneath. As I stuck my head under, the first thing I noticed was that I could see past my elbow in the water. Hell, I can see a lot more than just past my elbow. I saw for what seemed like an endless expanse of nothing, the vastness of the lake. It was a clear bright blue from where we entered the water but as I peered deeper into its depths, it was as if the light was being erased from existence. The light that was still perceived in the water was met with utter blackness at about 20ft into its body. I expected to see rocks and dirt at the bottom of the lake, maybe the occasional fish or turtle swimming by, but I didn’t see anything at all. As I stared into the absence of light that engulfed the entire world underneath me, I felt a sense of foreboding dread. I felt a small but strong vibration run through my body. I felt a light pull from my chest towards the core of the darkest part of the water…the…Void.

 As my lungs began to beg for air, before I yanked my own head out of the water, I could’ve sworn I saw the black Void moving closer. Slow like a cloud, but inevitable. I gasped for air as quickly as I could before I peered back into the water to verify my suspicions as true, but the Void stood where it had always been…right? I rip my head from under the water.

“Yo!.... Hey! …..Yall!” I tried to choke out, as water flooded in my mouth.  As my head bobbed in and out of the surface, all I could make out was the white water being kicked as they made their way to the other side of the lake. To avoid the overpowering sense of forced isolation and gloom hovering above me as I feared the endless possibilities living underneath me, I began to chase them.

 After about 10 minutes of focused and determined swimming, I caught up to the rest of the group as I saw Ivan climbing a large rock from the shallow end of the water near the large cliffside, while Pablo and Danny were already on top of the rock overlooking the rest of the lake. The cliffside provided shade from the bright sun. casting a large shadow. The water is colder here. If there was something underneath us lurking, it wouldn’t have any issues being camouflaged, stealing us away like a thief in the night. Throughout the entire time I was swimming, impossible thoughts of sharks, whales, and other large and implausible creatures bombarded my head and created images as to what can potentially be lurking in the abyss underneath. The closest ocean was 200 miles away, so unless there was an impossibly long canal underneath the state of Texas, it was very unlikely any sea creature was in this lake. But aren’t alligators fresh water? The smallest insinuation that any of this could potentially happen sparked enough imagination to get my legs kicking faster and forced my stroke cadence to increase. I soon climbed onto the rock following my friends.

“Hey are you okay? Did you pull a muscle or something? “ Ivan asked as he gathered his balance.

“Yeah you look out of it, do you need to sit?” Pablo chimed in

“No n-n-no, I'm okay. I was just a lil f-freaked out by the water. Did yall see anything in the water? Like didn’t the bottom look abnormally black?”

“Hey now, that sounds a little racially motivated” Ivan quipped with a slight smile that quickly faded.

“What do you mean ? Did you see anything?” Danny asked after his own light laughter trailed off, curiosity lingering in his voice

“That's the thing, I didn't see anything. Not the bottom of the lake, any fishes, nothing. Isn’t it weird that yall didn't see a single thing, despite how clear the water is?”

“Well …  it's probably clearer up top because everything else sunk to the bottom that would cloud the water. And we probably scared off all the fish with our swimming … It is a big lake, they could all be held up at another part” Pablo said in a matter of fact tone while also trying to find the logic in his own statements.

“Yeah I don’t see anything weird from here “ Ivan said, focusing his gaze with his hands over his eyebrows to focus his gaze into the water.

 I turned and confusion erupted in my head. Where I saw a distinct lack of light and total blackness, I now saw the bottom of the lake.  It wasn’t the absence of any light that I saw calling my name when I first entered the water, but it was rocks and dirt. How can that be? I begin to reason with myself. Maybe it was the initial shock of hitting the water. Everyone else are more seasoned swimmers than me, so maybe that’s why they didn’t experience the same level of shock as I did. Maybe I am still a little groggy from my nap on the drive over here. Yea, it had to be one of those things, because no one else saw it.

But then why did that dread still hang around me? I felt a pull. I felt something staring at me. Was the water alive or was something alive in the water? I felt both an urge to investigate it further while simultaneously  wanting nothing more than to not enter that water again. Once serene and enticing, now threatening and assaulting on all my senses.

After a few minutes of waiting it out on the rocks with the boys, I blurted out, “Hey yall, I-i-i-i-i just wanna go back to the house, yall can stay here as long as you want, but I'm not feeling too good”, as I began to slide down slowly on the giant rock side. I recognize that it is only me who felt this way and I am not going to let my own shitty feelings ruin anyone else's fun.

“Youre good my boy, we’ll join you” Danny said and everyone else nodded in agreement as they began to slide down the rock back into the water.

“N-n-n-no guys you don’t have to, I don’t wanna ruin yalls time. I just feel weird but I think once I get back to the house-”

“Shut the fuck up, we are coming with you. Plus I'm a lifeguard and if anything happens on the swim back, it's better to have someone with you that could save your life” Pablo stated in his forceful, yet compassionate, tone.

“Plus if this is some excuse for yall to go back to the house and kiss, we don’t wanna miss that. That’s free content” Ivan joked invoking a smile and laugh out of me

“Thanks yall. I just have a bad feeling about this lake now. I just wanna get out”

 We all began to swim back to the lake house. We swam in a V formation with Danny and Pablo leading the point and Ivan and I on opposite ends catching their draft. After a few minutes of swimming and my nerves calming down with each stroke, I could see the dock that we jumped off from within our grasp. The whole time I kept looking around the lake floor for any signs of life, but it was just us out there.

The pace was comfortable but moving. I found myself in a groove. One stroke, two stroke, three stroke, four stroke, Breathe. One, two, three, four, breathe. One, two, three, four, look up, breathe.

One

Two

Three

Fou-

I feel the vibration again. I continue swimming, too scared to stop, but I turn to look at Ivan swimming parallel to me and he gives me a mirrored “What the fuck is that” look. Without paying attention, I am met with Pablo's broad back as I swim right into him. I pull my head out of the water.

“Did yall feel that?! What the hell was that?! No no, like what made that?!” Pablo began shouting with the fear rising in his voice with every word.

“Did something jump in the water?” Danny panickily offered as he peered towards where we came from, towards the large rocks on the other end of the lake.

“This is w-w-what I f-f-f-felt. We need to get to shore”

We all began to sprint the last 100 yards to the shoreline, but as we did I began to see the lake floor turn a pitch black. I didn’t have time to stop in horror, I just kept swimming.

One, two, breathe, one, two, breathe, one, two, breathe

I felt a rush of water invade my mouth as I misjudged my next breath.

 I coughed out the intrusion, but that’s when I felt something infiltrate my mouth and was forcing its way down my throat. I stopped and began to thrash in the water, all sense leaving my panicked body. I felt what seemed like small hands grabbing on the inner part of my throat, the burning sensation unlike anything else felt before. I grabbed at the intruder, unable to see where it was but trying to feel where it was. Since I had stopped actively swimming, my body began to bob in and out of the water, with the sight of the lake house, the site of safety, being exchanged with the darkness of the water. I choked on the mysterious object making its way down my wind pipe, trying to suck in air through my nose but being met with lake water.

I could feel the intruder begin to slide further down my throat, my neck expanding as if I swallowed a bowling pin from the bottom up. My goggles were still on my face, obscuring my vision more as they began to fill up with tears of pain. I desperately grabbed for anything that I could pull this…this THING…from out of me. I wrapped my fingers around it. 

It felt like a different texture from the water, but slimy and wet all the same. My hands began to slip from it, so I tried to double down and wrap its slim and boneless structure around my fingers. I got a lil leverage and was able to pull it out a bit as I felt the thick and bulbous structure from my throat finally move the opposite way. I still felt what must have been a million different fingers dig into my throat like hooks on a fishing line. I was able to finally see some semblance of what was trying to force itself down my throat, and all I can describe it as if a white mouse's tale had been stripped of any hair and lubricated. The texture felt like jello and I struggled to gain leverage in my pull. My neck felt like it was going to explode any second. Whatever this was was too big to be in there. The battle for air between the creature trying to force itself and the water that was rushing through my nostrils was a losing one. I needed to see what I was grabbing at fully, so with one hand still gripped around this mouse tail-like figure, I snatched my goggles off with the other hand. My eyes burned from the mix of water, tears, and the shining sun. My vision is blurred as I try to see where I was.

 Where were my friends? Had they made it to the shore already? Did they…did they forget about me? I begin to struggle to see a shape that I recognize but all there was were blurs. My efforts split between trying to find my friends while still trying to pull this creature from my body. Then I found Ivan.

He was a bit ahead of me but still in the water but to a point where he can stand barely upright with the water coming to his neck. He had his hands close to his face clawing at his mouth as he turned to me.

“What the fuck” I try to utter but only produced a gurgling mess.

It was a white round object with a long thin tail protruding from the back. I couldn’t make out any limbs but if the same thing is fighting its way into my mouth then I know that they are there because I can still feel the small fingers gripping my inner throat.

I hear another sound, more clear than what Ivan and I could produce at the time, but full of fear and desperation, it is Pablo. I look ahead and he is further than any of us with the water at his hips and he is yelling. I have never heard him in terror before but from what he was holding in his hands, trying to prevent it from entering his mouth, I would be screaming too. It looked like a faceless egg with a tail.

Wait. Not an egg. Not exactly. It looked like a … sperm… a sperm egg. It looked like a giant sperm trying to force itself into his mouth.

My God, in the panic that began to build in myself and in the shock of the discovery, I had let it slip from my hands and it began to burrow down my throat and slither into my body. I cough and gag harshly, crawling my way in the water to a point where I can stand. My eyes begin to water and the burning sensation persists.

“F-f-f-fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck f-f-fuck” I stuttered with pain. I hunch down on my knees as I begin to feel dizzy and uneasy. My balance begins to waver. I turn to see where Ivan was and I hear him scream in panic as he's clawing at his throat, The sperm nowhere in sight. I shoot a glance at Pablo.

“ AAAAUUUURRRHHH” he yells as his fight is a losing one and it begins to breach his mouth.

I look towards the house and see Danny 15 yards away on the shore on his back. Blood rolling down the sides of his mouth, passed out . My vision begins to blur and I feel a heaviness in my stomach. I feel as if there's something moving within me, pushing organs around with disregard, ripping and tearing in the process. It feels as though I drank too much water and went for a run, having the feeling of the liquid slosh around in my insides. I fall on my back, unable to keep myself up from the pain. My eyes begin to drag down and my focus is unstable. I still hear Pablo’s and Ivan's screams and yells, but they become silent as I feel the darkness, the Void, of the lake consume me.



Part 2 The Water Broke

In a more violent manner to my head falling off my hand to jolt me awake earlier today, my eyes shoot open as if I took a shot of adrenaline. I am on my back looking up to the setting sun. It's quiet. Only the slight blow of the wind rustling the nearby trees fills the silence in the air. I try to sit up but I am restricted. A burning pain appears in my lower back when I attempt to sit up. I begin to shake, as if I had been doing sit ups for 5 min straight and I am about to give up. I surrender. I lay back down on the earth. The orange sky hangs overhead. The water from the lake hitting my heels that are buried in the sand. 

Wait.

The Lake.

I begin to get flooded with the realization of what just happened. My throat burns as a reminder. The feeling of razor blades being swallowed would be the closest thing I can describe it as. The rest of my body ached, every movement made was as if I had a 20lbs weight attached to each limb. What the hell were those things? Some kind of weird fish? No. No, I knew what they were. But how? How did they get to that size? And why was it so determined to…to get inside us?

 Ivan, Pablo, Danny. Oh God where were they?! 

I try to sit up again, ignoring the burn from all my muscles. I end up having to roll onto my side in order to get onto my hands and knees. Why was moving so hard? This question has been placed on the back burner as I try to move my head and look for any of my friends. While on my hands and knees, heart rate increasing with every struggling breath, I feel the center of my body being dragged back into the shore. I look down at my stomach, the source of the pull and-

“W-w-w-w-w-w-w-what the fuck….”

My eyes widened in fear and panic, threatening to pop out of their sockets. 

The burning of my throat is eclipsed by the panic coursing throughout the rest of my body.

I yell. Not out of anger or fear. It felt more primal. It felt like the only thing that I could muster.

“AHHHHH UUUUHHHH AAAAHHHHHH!”

I got to my knees and held my stomach. It was protruding several inches from the rest of my body. With its shape and the heaviness that it carried, it was as if I swallowed an elongated bowling ball. 

“No no no no no no. What is going on…what did it do to me!?”

I held my stomach with my hands rubbing around it. It felt inflated from the inside. As if there was gas trapped in there. 

Then I felt a sharp pain in my stomach. On the right side of my core, I felt a stab. As if it was a poke, or a jab, or a…

Kick.

My eyes widened, I began to hyperventilate. What the fuck did that thing do to me?

I look to the lake and feel the force almost knock me onto my back. What did that Void do to me? Do to us. Shit, my friends. Where were they?

I was right at the edge of the water. I got up slowly, my legs and knees buckling underneath me a few times. I regain my balance, despite being pulled forward with the weight of my stomach, I press forward towards the fire pit. Towards the log. I feel dizzy and weak. Feeling as if all the years of endurance sports were all for nothing, as every shuffle of my legs felt as if I ran a marathon. 

That's when I see Pablo.

“Shit shit shit shit” I say with rapid succession as I waddle towards him. 

His stomach is enlarged too. And it's…it's moving. 

Oh fuck its moving. 

From his stomach, I can see something moving from underneath his skin. It resembled a hernia but it was barreling like a gopher under the earth. It began on his left side and ran across the middle of his stomach to the other. It was almost as if something was running its finger across the inside of his stomach. That's exactly what it was. A finger. My suspicions were validated when I saw the imprint of a small hand reach out towards my direction from the middle of his stomach. I can see all 5 fingers grasping towards me, as if they were using Pablo's stomach as a glove. I then saw another protrusion stretch the upper part of his stomach towards his chest. It resembled a foot from the outline that I could make out. It's as if his stomach was made of a thin putty that trapped someone (something) inside it.

I could not formulate any coherent thoughts to what I was seeing. It was as if he, and by extension myself, were 9 months pregnant. At the sight of the movement in his stomach, I began to feel the growing awareness of the slight movement in my own stomach. I then felt a stabbing pain on the left side of my rib, as if whatever was inside of me violently crashed inside of me. I clutched my side as I am brought to my knees, wincing in pain. I look down and I almost vomit at what I see. I feel my own stomach skin begin to stretch and expand like it was being pulled apart. The pain burns and feels like I have internal bleeding. My body feels hot but I can't stop shivering. Through the pain I see the outline of a face, staring back at me from my own stomach. Staring up at me. I can tell its mouth is open from the outline. 

I let out another yell, but this time full of fear.

“Evan? Evan, are you there?!” I hear a call from my left. 

It's Ivan and Danny.

They are both using each other for leverage as they are standing on the other side of the fire pit. I turn to them and begin to cry. They are pregnant too. Danny has blood running down his mouth and the color in his face has turned a sick pale. Ivan held him up around the shoulders with one arm and the other arm under his stomach. His left eye is bloodshot. They both look like they are about to fall over and explode.

“What happened to us? What the hell happened to us!” Ivan pleaded. Then continued when he saw Pablo lying unconscious on the ground “Oh God is he…is he alive? Shit fuck”.

“I…i dont know i just foun-n-n-nd him this way. Theres…theres some-something in him…in me-e-e-e!” my brain couldn't process faster than my mouth, mumbling the words more than usual. I can feel my heart beat out of my chest. Or was that THINGS heartbeat? Fuck, i dont even know anymore.

“What do you mean there's something in yall? Does that mean it's in us too?” Danny asked as his voice began to break towards the end of his question. 

So many questions but the answers were not going to come. Before we began to hypothesize what was happening to us, we heard Pablo make a sound.

“Uuuuhhhhhh aaaahhhhh” he moaned as he began to sit up. His facial expression is one of someone who just threw up in the middle of a boxing match, face bloodied and devoid of color.

“Guyyyyysssss?” he said weakly.

That's when it happened. 

With no warning signal or care for the life that Pablo had before, the Thing began to birth itself. Pablo let out a blood curdling scream. We heard the tear of flesh and saw first his right leg being pushed from the inside out, past its normal limit, cracking his hip bone in the process, then his left side followed suit. We then saw Pablo's rectum tear open. The serene sound of the wind now replaced by Pablo's cries of pain and bone snapping on flesh. 

I try to get up to do something to help. I don't know what I could do, but I couldn't let my friend die without doing something. But as I begin to get off my knees, the shock and gravity pulls me back and I land on my ass, having me sit front row to my friend giving a violent birth.

What peeled itself out of him first was a small fat hand, looking to be its right. It waved in the air covered in a bloody mess. It grabbed leverage on a piece of exposed bone that jutted from Pablo's broken pelvis bone. It pulled the rest of itself out, having more strength than any newborn should have. At this point Pablo had stopped screaming. The entire space around him is a deep red of blood. For his sake, I hope he isn't awake. The rest of what came out of him was another arm, two legs, and a head. All of a toddler, but there was something very wrong with its composition. 

While it had all the right limbs and appendages, they were mismatched. Its right arm is where it was supposed to be, but its left arm was on the same side as the right, where its right leg is supposed to be. On the left, in the middle between where its shoulder and hip are placed, is one leg. The other leg is coming directly from its stomach. There's no sign of genitalia, at least from where I stood, although I wouldn't be surprised if it was somewhere where it shouldn't be.  

At that point, the entire lower part of Pablo had opened like a sunflower in bloom. My friend of 10 years, gone in the most violent of ways. I want to throw up. I want to cry. I get what I want, but only after I see this monstrosity's face. Everything is where it should be. Eyes, ears, nose, mouth, everything. What terrified me was that it was Pablo's face. His adult face. The face that laid attached to the now blown up corpse of my friend, with his eyes shot open and mouth gaped. It was his head, his face. Where once long brown hair adorned his head, now shown a smooth bald head. All his facial hair from his beard and eye brows looked completely shaven. 

But it is him. 

But it's not him. 

It's this thing that ripped itself out of him. It is standing 3ft tall from the cavern of flesh it made. It begins to cry a shrill sound that sounds like a mix of a newborn and a grown adult. It sounds inhuman. It looks inhuman. Its skin looks like it had been peeled off another animal and left in the sun to bake, then sewn back onto the body. 

I notice Danny and Ivan covering their ears to block them from the cries of the creature. I follow suit and look at it as it begins to turn around and bend its deformed body over the hole it came from. Its crying stops. It begins to eat. The sickening crunch of Pablo's exposed flesh and cracking of his bones as this demon seed digs its sharp small teeth into his flesh sounds like a pig eating slop. 

I can't take this anymore. I force myself up , ignoring the pain and fear of what my fate may soon be as well, and grab a nearby rock that's the size of my palm. I begin to wobble into a slight jog, letting the momentum of the extra weight pull me forward with more speed and I yell out a scream of anger as I bring the rock over my head and slam it down onto the back of the skull of the hellish newborn. It falls onto its stomach immediately , face planted into the lower body of Pablo. It's not dead, but I can see a huge indention on the back of its skull and blood squirted out where the impact was made. I finally get a glimpse of Pablo's face. His eyes had rolled to the back of his head, his jaw wide open. 

I'm so sorry this happened. God, I'm so sorry. 

“Come on, we gotta get out of here! “ I hear Ivan plead as he pulls on Danny who had fallen to one knee, his eyes full of tears and looking like they were about to pop out of his socket. 

I limp past Pablo's body one last time, as I begin to hear the moan of the creature regaining composure. It begins to cry again, but not one of pain or fear, but of anger. I meet Ivan and Danny at the door of the house. Before we enter we turn back to where that thing is, and see it drag Pablo's lifeless body by both of its small but strong hands back into the lake. Into the Void. We shut the door behind us and barricade it. We look at each other with tears in our eyes as the cries/yells of our friend coming out of the hellish spawn echo on the other side of the door. Accompanying it, providing a bass to the screeches that already reverberated throughout the house, was a dull roar that shook the ground below us. It could be mistaken for an earthquake if it didn't feel like it originated from something living. We peered out the window. The creature had dragged Pablo's body back into the lake. But as the sun still shined above, where the sun rays would reflect off the water and glisten, they were met with an utter darkness that consumed all sources of light and hope in its maw. 

Then I felt a kick.

1o0vyqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipping/comments/1o0vyqw/appropriate_tip_for_takeoutcounter_service/,Appropriate tip for take-out/counter service?,"My wife is pro-tipping in all sorts of situations, while I tip only on sit-down table service (20% consistently on the pretax total, unless the service was bad, in which case I go to 15%).  However, I don’t tip on take-out, counter service, places where I bus my own table or self-deliver my food to my own table, get my own drinks, etc.  Basically, if there is an iPad asking me “just one question” without accompanying table service, I uniformly answer that question as “no tip.”  I think tipping has gotten out of hand and I’m tired of being asked in an increasing number of places to tip 20%+ when the level of service comes nowhere near the effort of someone waiting my table.

This difference in tipping opinions led to a major blowup by my wife, when I opted no tip at a counter-service restaurant that didn’t even have tables or chairs, and she saw this, then came to tears, then didn’t talk to me for over a week.  We seem to be on at least a 1-day hiatus since today is my birthday, but the underlying issue is not resolved.  The suggested 20% tip on this transaction was probably $5 or $6.

Since this incident is such a sore subject for her, I don’t want to inquire now about how she arrives at what she feels is an appropriate tip in these situations.  Thus, I ask Reddit now for the Internet’s perspectives.

How do you determine for a take-out/counter service restaurant (or other retail establishment, coffee shop, frozen yogurt shop, etc.) that does not have table service, what is an acceptable tip?  Do you tip the minimum suggested?  How do you determine the tip before any product or service has been provided?  Do the wages of the staff influence your tip, such as if they’re making minimum wage versus being more generously compensated (and maybe even with other perks such as employer-subsidized health insurance or tuition reimbursement)?

If you tip more than minimum suggested, what criteria do you use?  Is ethnicity of the staff a factor?  Age?  Perceived socioeconomic status?  Restaurant is in a poorer neighborhood?  

Is the level of service a factor, and how do you determine how much more, especially since tip is requested at the start of the transaction as you pay, rather than at the end of a transaction at a sit-down restaurant?  Is the amount you tip on take-out arbitrary?  Just based on how you feel that day?  

Do you tip more if you earn more?  Do you tip more if you believe that most other customers can’t afford to tip what they want?  Do you tip more if the other customers are wealthier but they just don’t tip?  Do you tip more if you currently or previously worked in a tip-based job?  Does the amount of your tip change if you know that 100% of the tip is going to the employee at the register, or shared among the staff, as opposed to just being applied to the business’s general cash flow?

Genuinely curious as to what factors go into the decision to tip (and how much) outside table service.  Thanks much for your input.",0,1759882852.0,tipping,4,0.5,False

They showed me some equipment I should buy and where to get it. Done. 

The following week I texted to confirm we were going again - to be told no, just an hour before. They both had valid excuses and are usually reliable so I didn’t let it bother me. 

The next week no one said anything, even though we saw each other earlier in the day. 

Today I saw them and asked if they were still interested and they said yes, but would confirm later. Well the class is happening now so I guess it’s a no?

I wish they could have each said that as much as they liked it, it’s just too hard to make it to an evening class or they don’t want to. That’s much better than pretending it’s a yes. I’m a big girl and can take it lol. I probably should have just made up my mind to either go or not go regardless of their answer. I’ll definitely start doing that.

1o0vtnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/olympia/comments/1o0vtnq/yikes_madres_espresso/,Yikes @ Madres Espresso,"I would like to preface this post by saying that there are three intentions that come with getting this information out. The first being that if you have experienced a similar situation and feel like sharing, please reach out. We would like for this sort of maltreatment to cease, and we think that the more stories we have the more likely a report can be filed. The second being a call to action for people to cease being a customer at this establishment. The third is a warning to you or people you know to avoid working for this person. 

I used to work for Madres Espresso, as did many people who I still consider friends. In the span of just over a year of employment, I witnessed 3 of my friends get illegally fired, and I also got illegally fired myself. These were all at the hands of the owner, Amanda Snell. 

To understand a bit about the environment of working at Madres Espresso, I want to apply some context to the owner's personality. There is a manager, but she is not involved in much besides normal barista duties. Baristas report and work closely with the owner. While she was great at interacting with customers, she was incredibly disorganized on the back end. Her disorganization seemed to be what caused her to say rude things, have weird expectations of us, and generally run a very high-strung ship. She was super difficult to get along with, and speaking from experience it was not at the fault of the baristas. She often would do what i describe as talking ""at"" us, not ""with us"". She held no space for conversations and understanding. 

  
First firing: I'll call this barista Sarah. She is such an amazing person. Very responsible, very great with customers and a super efficient person to work with. One day, out of nowhere, Sarah got fired. Her being someone who everyone liked, people had questions. Amanda claimed that Sarah was stealing tips from customers by entering tips that they didn't make - in the sum of hundreds of dollars. I want to be so so clear when I say: tills were shared. There is no way that someone could prove which barista was entering tips. Everyone did it, every day. Amanda blamed the theft on Sarah and fired her, then refused to ever show proof that it even happened. Then, eventually, she fabricated ONE receipt where a $10.00 tip was added instead of a $1.00. Even a baby would be able to understand how easy it is to add an extra zero. Additionally, there is no way to prove whether it was Sarah or one of the other four girls working that day. Since Amanda claimed it was theft, it seriously apprehended Sarah's ability to collect unemployment. It became a legal case. 

  
Second Firing: I'll call this barista Emily. Emily had worked for the stand for about a year. She is beloved, truly such a lovely coworker to be around. Emily got pregnant. When Amanda found out, she fired Emily. Emily had even expressed that the rest of us baristas not tell Amanda because she feared she would get fired when Amanda finds out she was pregnant. She did. (Mind you, Amanda has a son of her own). 

Third firing: I'll call this barista Jane. Jane had worked for the stand for over a year. Five months in advanced she requested to have two weeks in the summer off so she could go on a trip to Europe. The vacation was approved. While Jane was on vacation, Amanda texted her and said ""I decided that I am going to move forward with our current team. Please return your key when you are back."" She fired her over a text while she was on an approved vacation. Jane got back from vacation the next day and immediately applied for unemployment. MANY of us know (thanks, covid), that the unemployment process is very tedious. When the department got back to Jane they informed her that Amanda told them that Jane took an unapproved vacation and left the country with zero notice and was gone for FOUR WEEKS. This led to weeks and weeks of having to submit proof that the vacation was approved months in advanced, plane tickets that proved exact duration of vacation, etc. When THAT legal proceeding was said and done (because yes, they also ended up requiring a court date for that), Jane was only able to access 1 week of unemployment when it took her 4 to find a job. 

Fourth firing: I'll call this barista Madison. Madison worked for the stand for 4 years. Customers love her, coworkers love her. She took on managerial duties and was extremely efficient at her job. Madison got pregnant. She took maternity leave and when she was ready to resume her job, Amanda told her she was not welcomed back. She then apprehended HER ability to access unemployment as well. 

  
The owner of Madres Espresso has a pattern that is illegal and heartless. Her willingness to impede on a system that exists so that people can access money when they are terminated - in all these cases, wrongfully terminated - is cold and cruel. **You should not be able to use your position of power to prevent working people from accessing a resources that helps them eat food and pay bills after being wrongfully terminated. The stress and harm that she puts people through is so wrong and unnecessary.** 

As I stated before, this was 4 cases in the span of one year. She now has 2 stands, twice the employees, and some time has passed. If you have experienced similar treatment, we would love to know. We think that something can be done if there is enough to report. We are tired of hearing about a business owner who mistreats women and operates illegally. It is inhuman. 

I have worked in the coffee industry in multiple capacities over the past 9 years and I can wholeheartedly say that there is no place for this sort of maltreatment.

He found the kitchen by following his nose and the sound of laughter. He came to the dining room first, full of individual tables and some long cafeteria-style tables, too. A straight, uncluttered path led right through the middle of the room to the kitchen in the back. He expected swinging doors and a gatekeeper waiting to direct him, but the opening into the kitchen was not barred by anything or anyone. People wandered in and out as if it were their own homes. Well, not in his home - his mom would never have allowed just anyone into the family kitchen, and his ex hadn’t cooked. Peter usually lived on takeout, so his tiny apartment kitchen was just a home for his coffee maker and microwave.

None of that had prepared him for this kitchen. There were multiple refrigerators along the side wall and several islands complete with sinks, mixers, and stovetops. It looked like one of those cooking competition shows he secretly loved. Many of the islands were busy with participants stirring, chopping, or washing something. Along another wall were several microwaves, and most of those were busy, too. No one looked up to question his presence, so he wandered into the room, heading for the refrigerators. He had read that he could choose a frozen meal or make something fresh. He wasn’t much of a cook, but even he couldn’t mess up toast or a deli sandwich. He found the toasters near the back along with a selection of bagels. He checked the fridge nearby and found flavored cream cheeses. It took him no time at all to pop an onion bagel into the toaster and lean against the counter, watching the hubbub around him while he waited.

“You like chili?” an older man asked, looking up from a huge pot on the stovetop in front of him.

It took Peter a minute to realize the man was speaking to him, but finally he said, “Sure. Who doesn’t love chili?”

“Yeah, but do you like it hot?” The man smiled, a glint of mischief in his weathered face. “Name’s Jack, by the way.”

“Yeah, I like it hot.” Peter nodded and introduced himself.

“It’s about ready, if you want some. Bowls right over there.” Jack gestured to a cabinet nearby.

“Oh, that’s okay. I’ve got my bagel,” Peter protested.

“Bagel won’t fill you up. Grab a bowl, there’s plenty.” Jack saw his hesitation and paused. “Oh sorry, supposed to say okay. Not used to that. Okay. No pressure. You enjoy your bagel.”

Peter fought a smile. “Actually, Jack, that chili smells fantastic. You want to keep me company while I check to see if it is as hot as you say?”

[**koranaceh.net**](https://www.koranaceh.net/) **| Banda Aceh –** Dinas Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral (ESDM) Aceh menyatakan tengah menggodok Peraturan Gubernur (Pergub) tentang Wilayah Pertambangan Rakyat (WPR) sebagai langkah konkret menertibkan aktivitas tambang ilegal di Aceh. Hal itu disampaikan oleh Kadis ESDM Aceh, Taufik, dalam Diskusi Publik “*Mengurai Benang Kusut Tambang Ilegal dan Solusinya*” di Hoco Coffee Lambhuk, Banda Aceh, Senin (6/10/2025).

Dalam forum yang diinisiasi oleh Forum Bangun Investasi Aceh (Forbina), Aceh Bergerak, dan Forum Jurnalis Lingkungan Aceh (FJLA) itu, Taufik menegaskan bahwa langkah tersebut merupakan tindak lanjut dari instruksi Gubernur Aceh, Muzakir Manaf, untuk menertibkan tambang ilegal di berbagai kabupaten/kota.

“Kita akan menertibkan tambang-tambang ilegal yang ada di Aceh. Dalam waktu dekat, Pergub tentang pertambangan rakyat akan kita siapkan agar masyarakat punya solusi legal untuk bekerja,” ujar Taufik.

Ia menambahkan, penyusunan Pergub WPR ini dilakukan dengan mengacu pada Undang-Undang Nomor 3 Tahun 2020 tentang Minerba, Undang-Undang Pemerintahan Aceh Pasal 156, serta Permen ESDM Nomor 174 Tahun 2024 tentang Tata Cara dan Teknis Penetapan Wilayah Pertambangan Rakyat. Pergub tersebut akan menjadi dasar hukum bagi masyarakat untuk mengajukan izin tambang rakyat setelah wilayahnya ditetapkan secara resmi sebagai WPR.

“Kami sudah menyiapkan langkah-langkah strategis. Setelah penertiban, kita segera membuka jalur legal melalui mekanisme WPR. Ini agar tambang yang sekarang dikelola masyarakat tidak lagi ilegal,” jelasnya.

I just turned 40, and for the first time, the milestone feels heavy. I’ve spent my adult life building my career as an architect. I’ve finally reached a point where my cash flow is stable, I have my own place, and on paper, things look great. But coming home to a silent apartment after a day of managing projects and clients is a loneliness that’s starting to ache.

The truth is, I’ve never been in a relationship. Time just seemed to… pass. I was always the quiet one, comfortable with my sketches and models, believing that if I just focused on my work, the rest would fall into place. It hasn’t.

There’s a woman I often see at a local coffee shop I go to for my afternoon break. She’s always reading, and I’ve built up a whole personality for her based on her book choices. I think we’d get along. But every time I consider walking over, my mind goes blank. I freeze. My throat gets tight. It feels like the most monumental task in the world—far more complex than any building I’ve designed. I'm trapped by my own shyness and a complete lack of confidence in this part of my life.

As an architect, I’m a problem-solver. I see a challenging site and I find a way to make it work. But I don’t even know where to begin with this. My professional life requires so much communication and conviction, but my personal life feels stunted.

1o0vmkv,https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughCommieSpam/comments/1o0vmkv/two_years_on_since_the_october_7th_attacks_ecs/,"Two years on since the October 7th attacks, ECS remains committed to standing against antisemitism.","On October 7th, 2023, Hamas militants invaded Israel, terrorizing numerous villages and a music festival. A staggering 1,195 Israeli civilians were murdered and another 251 taken hostage. Because they were Jewish.

Later that same month, October 2023, 250 homes in Paris, France, were marked with graffiti. As were homes in Berlin, Germany. Because the residents were allegedly Jewish.

In July and August, 2024, the Anne Frank statue in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, was defaced not once, but twice. Because Anne Frank was Jewish.

In November, 2024, six different small businesses in Los Angeles, California, had their glass doors smashed in. Because the owners were Jewish.

In May, October, and finally December, 2024, a girls elementary school in Toronto, Ontario, was subjected to three seperate shootings. Because the attendees are Jewish.

In March, 2025, a coffee shop in Toronto, Ontario, was broken into and looted for the second and third times within a year, with an additional incident leaving a spray-painted star of david. Because the owners are Jewish.

In May, 2025, the Dyke March in NYC, New York, banned 'Zionists' from attending. Due to a lack of definition and conflicting accounts, this was effectively a ban on all Jewish symbolism, Jewish representation, or Jewish advocacy, simply for being Jewish.

On June 1st, 2025, 15 people were senselessly attacked with molotov cocktails in Boulder, Colorado, including the fatal wounding of a holocaust survivor. Because they were Jewish.

In June, 2025, the National Holocaust Memorial in Ottawa, Ontario, was vandalized with red paint. Because the victims it memorializes are Jewish.

Also in June, 2025, a grocery store in Boston, Massachusetts, had its windows smashed in with bricks. Because the owners are Jewish.

In early September, 2025, a Jewish supply store in Los Angeles, California, was vandalized with a swastika. Because it was opnely Jewish.

Also in September, 2025, two synagogues in Halifax, Nova Scotia, were vandalized with graffiti. Because their patrons are Jewish.

In August and September, 2025, a souvenir shop in Prague, Czechia, was vandalized three times with urine and spray paint calling for another holocaust. Because the owners are Jewish.

Today, right now, on October 7th, 2025, in Gaza, there are still 48 hostages being held prisoner by Hamas, snatched away from their countries, from their homes, and from their loved ones, for two entire years. Just for being Jewish.

\-----------------

This list of incidents is in absolutely no terms exhaustive. It is merely a sample of events, primarily drawn from my own personal memory from reading about them as they happened. (Hence the bias towards recency.)

Antisemitism is explicited prohibited in ECS. This subreddit will always be a safe space for Jewish users, and we will always seek to promote solidarity with victims of antisemitism worldwide. Communist regimes infamously persecuted their Jewish populations, it is our duty as an anti-communist sub to stand against that historical legacy. 

In every instance, antisemitism is completely unacceptable. Jewish people have a right to feel safe no matter where they live. Jewish people have a right to equality amongst their fellow citizens. Those rights have not been upheld. Every injustice, whether it's destruction of property, threats and intimidation, or bloody and overt violence, must be opposed and condemned in the strongest terms. We will not be silent in the face of rising hatred.

1o0vl0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1o0vl0n/i_accidentally_joined_a_neighborhood_crime_watch/,I accidentally joined a neighborhood crime watch and now I have a whistle.,"It all started when I saw a flyer on a lamppost that said “Community Watch Meeting Thursday 6PM” and, for some reason, I thought it was a stargazing club. Don’t ask why maybe the word watch made me think of, you know, watching the sky.

So I showed up. I even brought a blanket and a bag of trail mix.

The meeting was in someone's garage. No telescopes. Just a whiteboard, a folding table with coffee, and about eight very serious people wearing reflective vests.

Before I could back out, a woman named Barb handed me a clipboard and said, “Glad you’re here we’ve had some porch pirate activity on Cedar Drive.”

Now, I could’ve clarified right then. I could’ve said, “Oh, I thought this was about constellations, not package theft.” But social anxiety kicked in, and I nodded like this was exactly where I meant to be.

Next thing I know, I’m being assigned Zone 2. Someone gave me a whistle. There was a laminated map involved. I didn’t even know my own block had zones.

For the past two weeks, I’ve been doing nightly “walks” with Barb and a retired guy named Stan who says things like, “Always trust your gut. And dogs. Dogs know.”

I still haven’t admitted I joined by mistake. And weirdly? I kind of like it. I’ve met more neighbors in two weeks than I had in the past two years.

Plus, last night someone gave me banana bread and said I was “bringing stability to the area.”

So yeah. I went looking for stars. Ended up watching for porch pirates. Life’s weird like that.",7,1759881805.0,story,3,1.0,False

1o0vkt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ContractorCorner1/comments/1o0vkt8/replacing_an_old_deck_heres_what_i_learned_after/,Replacing an Old Deck? Here’s What I Learned After Looking Into It,"Decks don’t last forever. Boards crack. Railings start to wobble. Wood gets soft in weird spots. One day you realize you’ve been patching it for years, and it’s just not holding up anymore. That’s when replacement becomes the only real option.

I started looking into what deck replacement actually involves, and it’s way more than just swapping a few boards. Most of the time it’s a full teardown—new framing, new boards, new railings, sometimes even a new layout altogether. It’s basically rebuilding your backyard from the ground up.

The biggest takeaway? Safety first. Old decks can be a real hazard. But beyond that, a new deck changes how you use your space. Family dinners outside, morning coffee spots, weekend barbecues—it’s lifestyle, not just lumber.

What surprised me most was how much material choice affects everything. Pressure-treated wood is cheap but needs constant care. Cedar and redwood look great but still need upkeep. Composite and PVC cost more up front but save a ton of maintenance later. Honestly, that trade-off makes sense if you plan to stay in your home for a while.

And yeah, permits. Every city seems to handle it differently, but skipping that step can cause major headaches later. Same goes for hiring the right contractor—licenses, insurance, real experience. Cheap bids can backfire fast.

If you’ve replaced a deck before, how did it go? Did you stick with wood, or go composite? Any mistakes you’d warn someone about before starting?",1,1759881789.0,ContractorCorner1,0,1.0,False

1o0vj4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o0vj4p/the_people_in_my_grief_counseling_group_are/,The People in My Grief Counseling Group Are Coming to Kill Me,"I used to have a post up where I explained how this all started, but I deleted it.

At the time, I thought I was just being paranoid — reading too much into things.

I was embarrassed. I didn’t want to look crazy.

I wish I hadn’t deleted it now.

If you missed it, this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/2E7E763PV5) covers some of what happened before, but things are different now.

Things have gotten worse. Way worse.

I didn’t want to go back to the grief group after what happened in my last post. 

I thought avoiding it would keep me safe.

I was emotionally exhausted and frightened. I had eventually confided in my parents about everything and told them that I needed space. 

I don’t think they believed me in the slightest but deep down, they knew something was genuinely troubling me. 

It was ironic that the place that was supposed to feel safest ended up feeling like a trap I’d willingly walked into.

I pulled away and for a brief bit, things seemed like they were returning to normal. 

But that’s when I kept seeing them — the other members — everywhere.

For example, I stopped off at the grocery store to pick up a couple of things last week, and that’s when I saw Mark. 

He was standing in front of the cereal aisle, staring at the same shelf like he’d forgotten what food was.

I was friendly enough and gave him a small wave, but he didn’t move or seem to register that I was there.

He just stood there with one hand outstretched toward a box of Frosted Flakes like he was stuck in a paused commercial.

It was like the lights were on, but nobody was home if you catch my drift.

Then I saw Lillian hanging out near the library. I didn’t say anything to her, but she was sitting on a bench with an orange popsicle melting in her hand. 

She kept repeating the same sentence:

“He dotted his i’s with tiny bubble circles.”

It was like witnessing a computer malfunction in real time. 

I ignored it and went about my business; I didn’t want anything to do with the grief group after last time.

But that all changed when I saw Greg at the park where Eli and I used to hang out a couple days ago.

When I was walking past him, something was...wrong.

His eyes were glazed over, blinking too slowly as he tossed breadcrumbs to the birds.

Except… he wasn’t.

His hand moved in a slow, looping rhythm — but nothing left his fingers.

He was mimicking the motion.

And the birds? They weren’t eating.

They were just still —watching with heads tilted.

“Greg?” I called out, concerned at what I was seeing.

He turned, his movements stiff and his eyes flickering with irritation.

“Do I know you?” 

“Yeah, I’m Lucas. We go to counseling together.”

“I have no idea what you’re talking about.” He tossed a couple more breadcrumbs to the birds near his feet.

“Sure you do, you lost your brother like I did. You said that your brother avoided spaghetti because the sauce smelled like pennies.” 

Greg shot me an angry glare and turned his back to me.

“I don’t know who you are, but you need to leave right now.” 

“I’m sorry.” I left in a hurry, not wanting to make the situation any more uncomfortable than it already was.

Something was deeply wrong.

Against my better judgment, I decided that I would go back to get answers.

I wasn’t going to go during a session though; I was going to go after hours.

I told myself it was just to calm my nerves, to prove there was nothing strange about it.

But deep down, I knew that wasn’t true. I wasn’t going there to be reassured — I was going there to find what had scared me away.

If there were answers to what was happening to them — to me — they’d be hidden there, in that circle of chairs where all of this began.



I left my parents’ house at around 8 p.m. 

They were off at some trivia night for a fundraiser they were passionate about.  I think they hoped I’d join them but I wasn’t really interested.

I had more important matters to attend to tonight. I couldn’t.

The sun had just dropped below the horizon as I circled the community center on foot to kill time.

The streetlights were slowly flickering to life one by one, and the traffic of people’s daily commutes were becoming quieter.

I watched my phone screen as the time grew closer to 9 pm, signaling the close of the community center and tonight’s session.

I waited for the place to clear out, for everyone to come outside so that I could sneak in before the doors locked.

But nobody ever came out. 

I stood outside and watched the time on my phone go from 9:05 pm to 9:45 pm. 

By 9:52, no one had come out.

I could’ve gone home. I told myself that more than once. 

But the part of me that needed answers — that part of me didn’t care how scared I was. 

The worst thing I could do would be to find out I was right.

Nobody had walked out yet.

What gives? Why was nobody leaving?

I tried the front door, but it was locked.

I looked inside the windows and was greeted with darkness.

I couldn’t see anything so I lifted on the window to see if it would budge.

Thankfully, it was unlocked, and I managed to crawl inside.

The air inside was stale with a mixture of old coffee grounds, paper, and like something had been left to rot inside the walls.

With a series of coughs, I stepped onto the floor and let the window fall shut behind me with a soft click.

The main hallway was lit only by a flickering EXIT sign in the distance. 

I passed the front desk and noticed the guest sign-in sheet was still out. 

I didn’t mean to look, but there it was — my name.

It had been written repeatedly on every line, signed in my handwriting. 

The dates went back years, even before I was alive.

The bulletin board near the front desk was still cluttered with yoga fliers, potluck invitations, and missing pet notices — but they all appeared to have had all the color sucked out of them. 

There was a new flyer tacked to the bottom corner — torn at the edge like it had been ripped from a child’s notebook.

I paused to read what it said:

“Grief Group – Tuesday’s @ 7 PM – Bring your most cherished memory.”

Beneath it, in messy, childish handwriting:

“He dotted his i’s with bubble circles.”

I blinked and saw that the flyer had vanished completely.

Had I imagined it?

I didn’t let myself dwell on it as I kept moving forward through the dark.

My phone vibrated in my pocket. A new text lit up the screen.: 

Mom: “Hope you're okay. Trivia just ended — we’re heading home soon. ❤️”

I stared at it longer than I meant to.

I could’ve gone with them, but instead, I was here pursuing something I didn’t fully understand.

I turned the phone’s light off and kept walking, not bothering to reply.

I strained my ears for any kind of sound — a creak, a whisper, a shuffle — but there was nothing, only silence.

I could only hear the sound of my own blood moving through my veins.

I crept farther down the hallway, my steps muffled by the old tile. 

The reeking stench of rot continued to grow stronger the closer I got to the counseling room.

I pressed my sleeve to my face, but it didn’t help. 

The scent was in the air, but also in the paint, the carpet, the wood…everything. 

It was like an infected wound left unbandaged.

I hesitated, my hand hovering near the frame, the door was already partially cracked open.

I pushed it open slowly…not sure what to expect on the other side.

I stifled a scream at the scene before me.

They were seated in a circle, the other members of the grief therapy group.

They were sitting silently in their chairs, completely motionless and seemingly unaware of my presence.

“Hello?” I called, my voice echoing.

There was no response. They didn’t even flinch when I stepped closer to them.

The eyes in their blank faces were open and fogged over, their limbs limp and slack.

They looked like puppets, staged for an audience that never came.

I backed up toward the window, my heartbeat hammering in my ears.

My breath hitched and I took a step back, but the silence around me thickened.

That’s when I heard her voice:

“Lucas.”

The voice slithered out from the far corner of the room as she slowly and deliberately emerged.

Jean.

Her green eyes glowed faintly in the dark, catching the flicker of the exit sign like an animal's. 

Her teeth smiled, but her skin didn’t follow.

“Who are they? What is this place?” The questions poured out of me as I met her gaze, determined to not let her see how scared I was.

She tilted her head, studying me like an insect under a microscope, her body looked half-sculpted out of shadow.

“They’re empty now,” she said, almost fondly. “Just… leftovers.”

She circled one of the group members — Jonah — and placed a hand gently on his shoulder. His head lolled slightly at her touch.

“Grief rots the soul in the most delicious ways. These?” She gestured at the others. “They were a buffet, nothing more than a tasting menu of sorrow. I’ve taken everything worth keeping.”

“You’re sick,” I spat.

She only smiled wider. “No, Lucas. I’m just very hungry.”

“What does that make you?” 

It was a question I most wanted to know despite dreading what I might hear.

Her eyes turned a darker shade as her features changed into something monstrous for a brief second.

“Are you sure you want to know?”

I swallowed the lump in my throat and looked at the group. Their heads remained still, but now I could hear a song playing in the distance.

Like a broken lullaby playing in an empty room, it echoed off-key and gradually grew louder.

“What else should I be... all apologies...”

I felt my blood turn ice-cold, not just because I recognized the song, but because it wasn’t coming from a speaker.

It was leaking out of Jonah’s now open, unhinged mouth.

He looked like a snake attempting to swallow its prey.

“Why do you know this song?” I asked, nervousness creeping into my voice.

Jean stepped closer, her features changing from human to monster and back to human in rapid succession.

Her pupils spread until they swallowed the green entirely and her skin thinned and tightened as if something beneath was pressing outward, desperate to crawl free. 

Her mouth stretched open widely, revealing a second row of teeth nested deep inside her throat, glistening like sunlight on glass. 

Behind them, I saw an eye blink.

It was Eli’s eye.

And it was watching me intently…

The air escaped my chest and my knees buckled…

Then it was gone, replaced by her human face again, as though nothing had happened.

“Because it’s yours, his, hers, and all of theirs.”

She pointed to each individual member in the circle as I stared at their lifeless bodies. 

 “What do you mean? None of this makes any sense. What do we and Eli have to do with you?”

Jean gave a small, pitying smile. “You mourn in a single thread, Lucas. But I walk the whole tapestry.”

She circled me like a shark that smelled blood in the water, methodical and precise.

“Do you really think you were the only one who had him? They all did — in places you’ll never see, in timelines you never touched. I’ve just consumed every drop of their pain until they became a husk of the person they were before. They only exist here, but everywhere else, they’re nothing.”

I felt all the color drain from my skin at the revelation.

“You’re lying.”

She didn’t flinch. “Grief is a powerful thing that tethers us to the most precious gift of all, memory. I show up where it pools and festers. I don’t create the pain — I just know how to find it.”

Her movements were unnatural, as though her body were lagging, catching up a fraction of a second too late.

Her fingers elongated, thinning into brittle shafts of yellow light and clicked against each other like insect mandibles.

I realized with dawning horror what they looked like.

Sun Sticks.

Eli’s Sun Sticks.

Except now they were splintered and curved at the ends like talons.

“I’ve worn many names and faces in the eons since my creation, but to feed on a pain as pure as yours Lucas... I had to be Jean.”

I wanted to cry, but not out of fear, but because seeing those beautiful, stupid little sticks we used to make had now twisted into weapons.

It felt as though Eli was being torn apart right in front of me.

“I need your grief to finish what I’ve started.”

Behind her, the others began to shift.

At first, just the slightest movements — a twitch of the hand, a slow turn of the head.

Then, they all began to murmur in soft, disjointed unison.

""All in all is all we are...""

The phrase repeated, growing louder and more distorted than the last, until the sound vibrated through the walls and crawled up my spine.

“It’s your turn to share.” Mark’s tone was flat and lacking any emotion. 

I watched them stand and approach me in small, jerky motions until they surrounded me in a loose circle.

“Eli’s gone,” Lillian whispered. “Share with us.”

“No, this isn’t real.” I closed my eyes, trying my hardest to convince myself that this was all just a nightmare.

Jean stepped towards me, her fingers twitched excitedly as they touched my cheek. 

“Don’t fight it. You’re the main course.”

She rubbed the tips together in a slow, circular motion — the same way Eli used to roll the Sun Sticks between his palms, warming them up before handing me one.

Seeing her mimic a ritual that was precious to me made something inside me snap.

“GET AWAY FROM ME!!!” I declared as I pulled away and ran towards the window.

I shoved past Shane and pulled the window open as I felt hands grip my ankle tightly. 

I could feel myself being pulled back in, but I thrashed around and kicked wildly until I was able to crawl through the window and fall to the ground outside.

As soon as my feet graced the sidewalk, I sprinted all the way home and locked the door behind me, gasping like I’d been drowning.

When I got home, the house was empty. 

I thought I’d beat them back from their trivia night at the fundraiser…but the car was in the driveway. 

All the lights were off, no note was left behind, and there was no indication that that they had been home at all.

After searching the house and not being able to locate them, I ran upstairs and immediately logged onto the computer. 

I’m typing this as fast as I can.

I need someone to know my story before I’m taken away entirely by something I can’t really comprehend.

Maybe this will be enough to warn someone, to avoid others from falling victim to…these monsters.

Wait…I hear something.

It sounded like the front door had opened.

I had locked it hadn’t I?

I called out and expected my mom or my dad to answer but nobody did.

I’m terrified right now.

I hear footsteps slowly walking up the stairs towards my room.

I hear inconsistent, strangled breathing from down the hallway — like someone trying to laugh and choke at the same time.

The footsteps have reached my door…they have stopped.

I don’t hear anything.

I can hear someone whispering as they jiggle the doorknob erratically. 

“He dotted his i’s with tiny bubble circles.”

And then, through the crack beneath my door:

""All in all is all we are...""

I see Eli’s eye staring back at me from the reflection of my computer screen.

“It’s your turn to share, Rabbit.”

After their chaotic summer in Santorini, the younger generation decided to act like adults.
Which, in their world, meant planning an International Friendship Dinner at Grimmauld Place.
Andromeda called it a nice idea.
Harry called it a potential crime scene.

⸻

🪄 Preparations, or: How to Lose Your Mind in Ten Minutes

Adrián Vogel was in charge of logistics — a mistake everyone immediately regretted.

“We must begin on time. Precision is respect,” Adrián said, straightening a line of enchanted spoons.
“Respectfully,” Lyra answered, “I was born late and I plan to die that way.”

He labeled every jar, alphabetized herbs by magical potency, and made Hermione sign a Dinner Compliance Form.

Ron stared. “There’s paperwork for eating?”

“Of course,” Adrián said. “Without order, there is chaos.”
“And without chaos,” Lyra grinned, “there is no fun.”

By the time Harry and Ginny arrived with Teddy and Andromeda, the table was an over-organized masterpiece.

“So this is diplomacy,” Harry said.
“This is doom in candlelight,” Ginny corrected.

⸻

🔥 Enter the Malfoys

The Floo roared green — out stepped Narcissa Malfoy, ethereal and elegant, her silver robes glowing softly in the dim light.
Lucius followed moments later, every strand of hair perfectly in place and holding a basket of enchanted truffles.

“We brought refinement,” he announced.
“And sanity,” Narcissa added. “Though I’m not sure it will survive the evening.”

Draco brightened immediately.
Lyra waved from across the room. “Mrs. Malfoy! You’re just in time for chaos!”

“Ah,” Narcissa said smoothly. “So you’re the reason my son’s stopped scowling. I’m… intrigued.”

Lucius looked around in dismay. “You call this… a dinner?”

“We call it survival,” Hermione said.

⸻

🍲 Dinner Diplomacy (and Explosions)

Dinner began with the best intentions — which, in this group, was a red flag.

Adrián’s soup developed sentience and tried to leave the bowl.
Elara’s salad glowed.
Ron’s roast transformed into a small dragon.

“It’s fine!” Ron yelled. “Adds atmosphere!”
“Adds trauma!” Hermione shouted back, extinguishing a flame.

Narcissa, unbothered, sipped her wine.

“I see Hogwarts’ culinary curriculum remains… creative.”

Lucius leaned toward Isabel with a smirk.

“My dear, you must long for intelligent conversation.”
Isabel smiled serenely.
“Not really. I have Sirius.”

Everyone laughed — including Narcissa, quietly hiding her amusement behind her glass.

“Touché,” she murmured.

⸻

💥 Teddy, Trouble & The Great Indoor Quidditch Match

Halfway through dessert, Teddy found a toy broom.
Minutes later, indoor Quidditch was born.

“He’s got Sirius’ energy,” Ginny said fondly.
“And Harry’s disregard for safety,” Hermione added.

Adrián tried to enforce rules.

“Nein! There must be structure!”
“There must be snacks!” Ron yelled.

Lyra enchanted the cushions into floating bludgers.
Claudia documented everything for Witch Weekly: “Domestic Elegance: When Purebloods Stop Pretending to Be Calm.”

Lucius narrowly dodged a rogue Quaffle.

“This is barbaric!”
“You say that like it’s an insult,” Ginny said.

⸻

💫 The Reunion

While the others shouted and laughed, Narcissa slipped quietly into the library — only to freeze at the doorway.

There, sitting near the fireplace with a cup of tea, was Andromeda Tonks.
Her hair streaked silver, her posture proud, her eyes steady — the sister Narcissa hadn’t seen since the day she was disowned for marrying Ted.

The room fell silent as their eyes met.
Years of silence, grief, and pride stood between them.

Finally, Andromeda smiled softly.

“Hello, Cissy.”

Narcissa inhaled sharply at the old nickname — one she hadn’t heard since childhood.

“Andy… you haven’t changed at all.”
“You have,” Andromeda said kindly. “You look… at peace.”

They sat across from each other, two halves of a family fractured and mended by time.
Narcissa hesitated, voice trembling for the first time.

“I thought you’d never forgive me.”
“I thought you’d never try,” Andromeda replied gently.
“But here you are.”

A long pause — then Narcissa reached out, and Andromeda took her hand.
No tears, just quiet understanding.

From the doorway, Sirius watched — eyes glinting, grin soft.

“Knew it,” he muttered. “Andy’s always been my favorite cousin.”
Isabel nudged him. “You’re incorrigible.”
“And charming,” he added proudly.

⸻

🍷 Late-Night Toasts & Black Family Legends

Back in the dining room, the chaos had mellowed into laughter.
Narcissa and Andromeda rejoined the table — sitting side by side for the first time in decades.

Lucius blinked. “You’re… smiling.”

“I’ve been reminded what family actually means,” Narcissa said simply.

Sirius raised his glass.

“To the Black women — terrifying, brilliant, and impossible to control.”
Andromeda clinked glasses. “And to the few surviving Black men who haven’t ruined dinner.”

Everyone burst into laughter. Even Lucius chuckled, albeit nervously.

Adrián tried to restore order.

“Perhaps we can resume with the formal toast—”
“Adrián,” Lyra interrupted sweetly, “if you mention structure again, I’ll hex your schedule.”

⸻

🌅 Morning at Grimmauld Place

The next morning, sunlight streamed through enchanted windows.
Grimmauld Place smelled of coffee, toast, and leftover magic.

Lucius was asleep on the couch under a “Do Not Feed” sign.
Narcissa and Andromeda were sharing tea, talking quietly about their childhood at 12 Grimmauld Place.

“Mother would be horrified,” Narcissa said.
“Then we must be doing something right,” Andromeda replied.

Sirius walked in, ruffling Teddy’s hair.

“Good morning, chaos gremlins.”
Isabel smiled at him over her mug. “You realize you’re the biggest one?”
“Of course,” Sirius said proudly. “But I make it look elegant.”

Narcissa laughed softly. Andromeda smiled wider than she had in years.

1o0vhx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1o0vhx2/most_famous_book_series_in_order/,Most Famous Book Series In Order,"Hey everyone,

I just finished reading *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* (or *Philosopher's Stone*, depending on where you are!), and I simply had to share my thoughts. This book, of course, kicks off one of the [Most Famous Book Series In Order](https://pdfhive.com/most-famous-book-series-in-order/) out there, and I finally decided to dive in myself. If you're looking for a fresh perspective on a classic or just wondering if it's worth picking up, read on!

***

### A Quick Look at the Story (No Spoilers, Promise!)

Okay, so for those who somehow missed it (it's hard, I know!), this book introduces us to Harry Potter, an orphaned boy living a miserable life with his awful aunt and uncle. Everything changes on his eleventh birthday when he discovers he's a wizard and is invited to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The story follows his first year at this magical school, making new friends, learning spells, and stumbling upon a mystery involving a powerful artifact. It's truly a journey from the mundane to the magical, filled with wonder and a growing sense of adventure.

***

### What I Thought – The Good and the Great

Honestly, I can see why this series captivated so many. The **world-building** is just phenomenal. Rowling crafts this incredibly detailed and imaginative magical world right under our noses, making you wish you had your own Hogwarts acceptance letter. I loved how she layered the magic into everyday life, making it feel both extraordinary and strangely familiar.

The **characters** are brilliant, too. Harry, Ron, and Hermione quickly become a trio you genuinely root for. Harry's journey from a shy, mistreated boy to someone finding his courage and belonging is really heartwarming. Hermione's cleverness and Ron's loyalty (and humor!) make them perfect companions. Even the side characters, like Hagrid, are so well-drawn and memorable.

The **writing style** is so accessible and engaging. It reads very smoothly, almost like you're listening to a friend tell you a fantastic story. The pacing felt just right – a gentle start, building up to some exciting moments, and keeping you eager to turn the page. It's full of charm, humor, and just enough suspense to keep things interesting without being overly scary. I found myself smiling a lot while reading.

***

### Anything I Didn't Quite Click With?

To be perfectly honest, there wasn't much I didn't like. If I had to pick something, maybe a couple of the plot resolutions felt a tiny bit too convenient, but honestly, that's nitpicking for a children's fantasy novel. The pure joy and imagination in the book far outweigh any minor quibbles. It’s not a gritty thriller, but it has its moments of tension that keep you invested.

***

### Should You Read It? And Who's It For?

Absolutely, yes! I wholeheartedly recommend *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*. It's a fantastic entry point into the world of fantasy, full of heart and adventure.

I think this book is perfect for:

*   **Casual readers** looking for an enjoyable, easy-to-read story.
*   **Anyone who loves fantasy** and hasn't experienced this classic.
*   **Parents** looking for a great read-aloud or a book to share with their children.
*   **People new to reading larger books** – it’s a wonderful way to get hooked.

If you enjoy a good story about friendship, courage, and discovering your true self amidst a magical backdrop, this is definitely for you.

***

### A Little Guide for New Readers

If you're just starting your reading journey or thinking about picking up a series like this one, here are a few friendly tips:

1.  **Don't Rush:** It's not a race! Take your time, enjoy the descriptions, and let the world sink in.
2.  **Find Your Spot:** A comfy chair, a quiet corner, or even a bustling coffee shop – find where you feel most relaxed to read.
3.  **Read a Little Each Day:** Even 15-20 minutes can make a huge difference. It helps keep the story fresh in your mind.
4.  **Don't Be Afraid to Put It Down:** If you're not enjoying a book, it's okay to try another. Reading should be fun! But for a series as popular as this one, give it a fair chance – sometimes it just takes a few chapters to get into the flow.

***

### Final Thoughts

This book truly lives up to its hype. It's a delightful journey that reminds you of the magic in discovering new worlds and the power of friendship. I'm already eager to dive into the next one. It's a classic for a reason, and if you haven't read it yet, now might be the perfect time to explore why it's on almost every list of the [Most Famous Book Series In Order](https://pdfhive.com/most-famous-book-series-in-order/).

1o0vddj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheOutsiders/comments/1o0vddj/first_encounter/,First encounter!!,"The sun pierced over the pages of her book, forcing her to glance at the scenery in front of her. She had forgotten herself in the park, with her nose buried in her book, with the occasional adjustments of her glasses interrupting her focus. But now, the setting sun had snatched her attention as she gazed at the landscape. It was just her, on a bench by the lake, the hues of orange and green signaling autumn on the horizon. The sun's rays peaked through the orange leaves, warming her cheeks, and begging her to take in a deep breath. This was why she was here - peaceful, serene and most importantly far away from humans! She made her way back home to her little cabin, secluded among the trees and overshadowing the lake. Her cabin was laid out like a studio apartment, with some separation between the bedroom, kitchen and bathroom. But she didn't care about all of this. The cabin had a fire place, and most important a tiny sun tunnel that filled the room just the way she liked it. She continued her chores, taking her time and enjoying the slow pace of the countryside.

The mug still steaming with hot chocolate warmed her hands. She laced her fingers in between each other clasping the mug tightly and taking a sip. The robust chocolatey flavor filled her sense of taste and the warmth traced its way down her body. It was a cold night, and even though the fire was on, and a cozy blanket hugged her from her neck to her toes - it was still cold. It was a lonely cold. Her knees rubbed against each other trying to generate heat, but something was missing. The divorce although very much a necessity had left a gap. If only there was someone to share this night with. She looked out through her small cabin window, watching the moon reveal itself from behind the scattered clouds. This would have been a nice evening to share with someone. Not just anyone, someone kind hearted, and gentle, but strong and beautiful. This was a lot to ask for these days though. Relationships today have been reduced to transactions people make for status. Or at the very least to keep the depression away. She wasn't that foolish though, been there done that. What she wanted was someone real!

She drank her cocoa and gazed at the moon, listening to wind whistle lullabies to her. The fire danced to the music as well, soothing her gently to sleep. Her small cabin, although empty was at least cozy, and the cold room had finally warmed up enough for her to relax. She questioned herself as she fell asleep, do I really need anyone ruining this? It's so quiet, and peaceful, I mean I have my life back, it's finally mine again. No, I'm gonna enjoy this country side a little longer, I'm going to take time for me, she thought. Her blissfully deep sleep, was interrupted by the wind again. But this time howling. The calm night had shifted while she dozed off. The cabin was filled with the sound of leaves violently rustling, protesting the ferocity of the wind, or perhaps warning against it. It was completely dark too, just a small fraction of faint moonlight pierced the center of her cabin, bouncing off the coffee table. This cozy cabin felt so different now, but this was nothing - she was used to this. In the countryside, the weather dictates your day. There was a sudden thudding sound that enveloped the cabin, shaking the floor boards. She wondered if a branch had fallen on the roof. She decided to check it out. She grabbed her phone and turned on the flashlight. Reaching for her cozy slippers as she shuffled her way to the front door. 

She opened the door and almost walked right into him. She had not expected anyone to be at her door, he was so silent and his clothes so dark. She followed his garments with her flashlight, pointing it higher and higher trying to make sense of what was in front of her. She realized this was a rather tall man standing in her doorway. His eyes locked with hers and for a second beamed red. But she looked closer, he seemed completely exhausted, lifeless and at death's door. She could barely make out his face because his long pitch black hair acted as curtains, only revealing pieces of his likeness to her.

You must be freezing she thought, and grabbed his hand dragging him through the threshold of her door and into her cabin. She immediately ran to the fireplace attempting to restart it. She always struggled with this task. ""Common!!"" She yelled to herself. This was no time for mistakes, someone could die she thought. His hands were so cold, she felt he didn't have much time left. She wrestled with the matches and her anxiety, striking the matchbox, over and over again. Suddenly she felt his cold lifeless hands, wrangle her neck. It was very tight, his hands were very strong. Is this it, she thought, after finally getting my life back, I'm about to be killed by some serial killer?!? All because I decided to be a decent person? In her panic, she let go of the match which she had finally lit. It hit the fire place illuminating the cabin once more. As he pulled her effortlessly off the ground and towards his face, they finally met.",1,1759881234.0,TheOutsiders,0,0.67,False

What does that even mean?","I (38F) went on two incredible dates with a guy (33M). Both were long, like 14 hours each, and just really easy and natural. We talked for hours, cooked dinner together, laughed a ton, and the chemistry was unreal. He has this calm, darkly funny, quietly intense energy that drew me in right away. I felt more comfortable with him than I have with anyone in a very long time.

He stayed over both times. It was sweet, affectionate, and genuinely intimate. The second morning over coffee I told him I really liked hanging out with him, that it felt easy and natural, and asked if he would want to do it again. He said, “yeah, I think so.” I mentioned being free Friday and he said he’d let me know.

I was overthinking me asking him to hang out again so I reached out to tell him there isn't pressure, I understand if he doesn't want to. He replied, “I do want to keep hanging out, maybe just not as often as you might want tbh. Don’t overthink it 🙂” Then he added, “Doesn’t look like Friday’s going to work for me btw.”

I said, “okay! I’ll see you another time :)” and he gave that a thumbs up.

For context, he’s recently out of a long-term relationship, mentioned something casual going on with a woman in another city, and is figuring out his work situation. I’ve been single for a while after a big breakup and honestly, I just felt something with him. That rare, warm, calm connection that makes you feel safe and seen.

So now I’m overthinking everything and could use some perspective:

1. What does “keep hanging out, just not as often as you might want” actually mean
2. Do you think he’ll reach back out at some point
3. Should I leave the door open or just move on quietly
4. How do you stop spiraling when something feels this good but uncertain
5. Should I reach back out in a couple of weeks if he doesn't?

Would love honest takes, even if they’re tough to hear.

by Preston Dennett

All UFO encounters are interesting, but perhaps the most fascinating is when UFOs land and humanoids come out! Here are ten cases of UFO landings from across the world including the United States, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Spain, Norway, Finland, Scotland, France and England. They span over a period of five decades. They involve a wide variety of humanoid figures. Many are multiple witness cases. Almost all of them involve some form hard evidence such as landing traces, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances, psychic effects and physiological reactions. Some include government involvement and even disturbing threats from apparent men in black.

JUL 23, 1947, PITANGA BRAZIL: Topographer Jose C. Higgins hears a high-pitched hum. Suddenly a metallic craft lands next to him and out come three beautiful ETs wearing weird spacesuits. Jose founds himself surrounded by them. To his relief, they appear to be friendly. Feeling fear, he retreats and watches them from a distance as they begin playing like small children.

AUG 1960, NEWCASTLE, NSW AUSTRALIA: Helen Aldridge is awakened by a buzzing noise coming from outside her home. Looking out the window, she sees a craft shaped like a toy top landing in her backyard. Out steps a humanoid dressed in an olive-green jumpsuit. To her shock, it climbs over her fence and approaches right up to her window.

JUL 31, 1966, PRESQUE ISLE STATE PARK, PA: When their car gets stuck in the sand, Gerald LaBelle goes for help, leaving behind Betty Klem, Doug Tibbets, Anita Haifley and her two children. Without warning, a UFO lands in the forest next to them. Police arrive and leave with Doug to investigate. At this point, a huge hairy humanoid emerges from the forest and attacks the car. Before long officers from Project Blue Book arrive to investigate.

AUG 29, 1967, CUSSAC, FRANCE: When 13-year-old Francois Delpeuch and his little sister Ann-Marie (age 9) go to retrieve the family cows, they come upon a huge glowing sphere and four small humanoids walking around beneath it. When they approach for a closer look, the strange beings notice the two children and begin floating one by one back into the craft.

FEB 5, 1971, KINNULA, FINLAND: Two forestry workers (Peter Aliranta and Esko Sneck) get the shock of their lives when a UFO lands next to them in the forest. A small 4-foot-tall being emerges and approaches Peter. When the being turns around to enter the craft, Peter rushes forward and grabs the ET by the foot. It’s a decision that he will regret for a long time.

NOV 14, 1976, WINCHESTER, ENGLAND: Joyce Bowles is driving home. Her friend Edwin Pratt is in the passenger seat. They are concerned to see a UFO dropping down from the sky ahead of them on the road. Suddenly their car steers itself off the road. When they finally get it to stop, they see a UFO blocking the roadway and humanoids looking out the windows at them. Then one emerges from the craft, walks right up to them and stares at them fixedly. Their strange adventure has only begun.

MAY 18, 1977, ELGIN, SCOTLAND: Karen McLennan and Fiona Morrison (both 10-years-old) are playing near their homes when they hear a soft humming noise in the woods. They go to investigate and come upon a landed craft. Standing next to it is a tall slender man dressed in a silvery jumpsuit. As the man walks towards them, the girls flee. When they turn around, they see the craft flying off. But when they get home, they learn there are more witnesses. And then the threats start coming in.

SEP 18, 1978, SAN GIORGIO DI NOGARO, ITALY: Railway employee Giorgio Filiputti only wants to enjoy a quiet day of fishing. But it’s not to be. He hears a strange noise and an odd breeze. Going to investigate, he comes upon a landed craft. A weird 4-foot-tall humanoid looks surprised to see Giorgio approach. He stares at Giorgio and begins to work on apparently repairing his craft.

NOV 24, 1978, GERENA, SPAIN: When four young men go hunting along the Guadiamar River, they get a lot more than they bargained for. Seeing strange lights in the forest, they come upon a landed UFO and a 7-foot-tall humanoid. The strange figure starts walking towards them. When it gets too close, the men run away in a panic. Later, strange land-traces are found.

JUL 25, 1981. STJORDAL, NORWAY: Hjordis Hokstad wants only to enjoy her morning coffee and watch the wild deer in the field behind her house. Instead she sees a landed UFO and a weird humanoid wearing a spacesuit walking around the craft. She grabs her binoculars and gets a nice close look. Little does she know, her neighbor is watching the whole thing from his house.

There is no more room for denial. The evidence for the reality of UFOs and extraterrestrials is here for those with the courage to examine it. We are not alone! We are only one of many different humanoids in a universe teeming with intelligent life.

1o0v5in,http://pawsofability.com,Flying with Service Animals: What You Need to Know,"If you’ve ever thought about flying with your service animal, you already know it can feel like a mix of excitement and anxiety. Whether you’re traveling for a family vacation, visiting loved ones, or heading to an appointment far from home, the thought of navigating airports, security lines, and airplane seats with your furry partner can feel overwhelming.

As a parent of a child with Autism who relies on the comfort and support of a trained service animal, I’ve been there. I remember our first flight vividly — the noise, the stares, the stress, and the deep sigh of relief when we finally landed, and my child’s service dog calmly rested under the seat. That day taught me a lot about preparation, patience, and advocacy.

This guide is designed to alleviate the fear and confusion associated with the process. I’ll walk you through everything you need to know — from airline rules and documentation to packing tips, airport routines, and what to expect once you’re in the air. So, grab your coffee, take a breath, and let’s dive in together.

#  What Counts as a Service Animal (and What Doesn’t)

Before booking your flight, it’s essential to understand what the **Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA)** defines as a service animal.

A **service animal** is a **dog** that has been individually trained to perform tasks for a person with a disability. This includes physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disabilities. Emotional support animals (ESAs) are no longer eligible for free travel in the cabin under this law.

That means:

* **Trained service dogs** (for autism, mobility, PTSD, diabetes alert, etc.) are allowed in the cabin. 
* **Emotional support animals, therapy animals, or comfort pets** are **not** recognized as service animals and may be treated as regular pets (with fees and size restrictions). 

So, if your animal performs a specific task — such as alerting to anxiety, interrupting meltdowns, or guiding through crowds — they’re protected as a service animal.

#  [**Step 1: Know the Airline Rules and Forms**](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/frequently-asked-questions/i-have-service-animal-what-type-screening-should-i-expect)

Each airline has its own process, but most follow the U.S. Department of Transportation’s **Service Animal Air Transportation Form**. This form asks for:

* The handler’s name and contact information 
* The dog’s training and behavior certification 
* Health and vaccination details 
* Confirmation that the animal is under control and won’t relieve itself inappropriately during the flight 

You can find this form on each airline’s website, usually under their “Accessible Travel” or “Service Animals” section. It’s best to **submit it at least 48 hours before your flight** to avoid any issues at check-in.

 **Pro tip:** Print a copy of your form and keep it with your travel documents for easy reference. Not every gate agent or staff member will have access to their online system, and having a paper copy can prevent unnecessary stress.

#  Step 2: Preparing for the Trip (Packing for You and Your Service Dog)

Flying with a service animal means packing for two! I like to think of it as a “team travel kit.” Here’s what I always include:

# For Your Service Animal:

* **Service vest and ID** (not legally required, but helps avoid confusion) 
* **Leash and backup leash**
* **Collapsible water bowl**
* **Small treat pouch**
* **Waste bags**
* **Favorite chew toy or comfort item**
* **A travel mat or blanket** (helps your dog settle under the seat) 
* **Copies of vaccination and health records**
* **Medications** (if any) 

# For You (and your family):

* **Snacks and water** (especially if your child is neurodivergent and sensitive to hunger or texture) 
* **Noise-canceling headphones or fidgets**
* **Wipes and sanitizer**
* **Change of clothes** (accidents happen — for both humans and dogs!) 
* **Copy of your service dog paperwork and airline form**

If you’re traveling internationally, check the entry requirements for **animals in the destination country**. Some countries have strict quarantine or vaccination rules, and you don’t want any surprises at customs.

 **Step 3: At the Airport — What to Expect**

# Arriving Early

Arrive at least **two hours before domestic flights** (three hours for international flights). This gives you time to check in, go through security, and find relief areas without rushing.

When you check in, **let the gate agent know** you’re traveling with a service dog. They’ll confirm your form and often offer pre-boarding so your dog can settle before the crowd boards.

# Going Through TSA

This is where many people get nervous — but don’t worry, it’s easier than you think.

When you reach TSA:

1. Keep your dog on a leash. 
2. You’ll walk through the metal detector **together**. 
3. TSA may ask you to remove the dog’s vest or gear (if it triggers the alarm). 
4. They might swab your hands for explosive residue — it’s quick and harmless. 

If your child or dog becomes anxious, explain calmly to the TSA agent. Most agents are trained in accessibility and will accommodate requests for extra time or a quiet space.

 **Parent tip:** I tell my child ahead of time what the beeps and security area will sound like — that preparation alone helps reduce sensory overwhelm.

#  Service Animal Relief Areas

All major airports now have **service animal relief areas** inside or near terminals. Look for the paw-print signs or ask a gate agent to guide you. These are often small grassy or turf areas with waste bags and trash bins.

If your flight is long or you have a layover, plan breaks at these areas — even if your dog doesn’t go, it gives them a chance to stretch and reset.

 **Pro tip:** Bring an extra potty pad if your dog refuses to “go” in public or on artificial turf. Some dogs get shy in unfamiliar environments!

#  [**Step 4: Boarding and Seating**](https://pawsofability.com/offerings/)

You have the right to sit anywhere your ticket allows, as long as your service dog **fits safely at your feet** without blocking aisles or exits. If your dog is large, bulkhead seats (the first row of the cabin) usually offer extra legroom.

Ask politely at check-in or boarding if these seats are available — most airlines are accommodating when it comes to accessibility needs.

When you board:

* Guide your dog to your seat and use a **“settle”** or **“under”** command. 
* Keep your leash short but relaxed. 
* Avoid giving food or water until cruising altitude (to prevent upset stomachs). 

Some flight attendants might offer water during the flight — feel free to accept if needed, but always keep your dog calm and comfortable.

#  Step 5: In the Air — Staying Calm and Comfortable

Here’s where preparation pays off. Once you’re seated, take a deep breath. Most service dogs naturally go into “rest mode” during flights, but here are a few tricks I’ve learned along the way:

* **Stay confident and calm.** Your dog senses your emotions. The more relaxed you are, the more they’ll settle. 
* **Use gentle touch or verbal praise.** A quiet “good boy” or “you’re doing great” goes a long way. 
* **Keep routines.** My son’s service dog always gets a chew toy after takeoff — it’s become their cue that “we’re okay now.” 
* **Block distractions.** Flights are noisy and full of smells; a familiar blanket or mat helps create a “safe zone.” 
* **Avoid petting requests.** Most people are curious and kind, but it’s okay to say, “Thank you, but he’s working right now.” 

If your dog gets restless, try subtle cues — like shifting your legs slightly or offering a calm “down” reminder. For anxious handlers or children, deep breathing exercises can help both of you.

#  Step 6: Landing and Arrival

When the plane touches down, wait for the seatbelt sign to turn off before moving. Let your dog stretch, but keep control as passengers exit. Once off the plane, **head directly to the nearest relief area** if your flight was long.

Customs and immigration officials (for international travel) may request your animal’s health documents, so keep them readily available.

If your child is sensitive to crowds or sudden noises, try to stay seated until most passengers have deplaned — the quiet helps make transitions smoother.

#  Special Considerations for International Travel

Flying internationally with a service animal adds a few extra steps:

1. **Research the destination country’s import rules.** Some require advance paperwork or quarantine periods. 
2. **Contact the destination airport** for their service animal policies, especially regarding relief areas and customs checks. 
3. **Carry a letter from your veterinarian** confirming vaccinations and health status. 
4. **Check airline policies for connecting flights** — not all foreign carriers follow U.S. service animal laws. 

Countries like the U.K., Australia, and Japan have stricter entry laws, so always confirm before booking.

#  My Personal Experience: Our First Flight Together

I’ll never forget our first flight with my son’s service dog, Max. We were flying to visit family for the holidays. My son had been anxious for weeks, worried about the loud noises and the idea of being “trapped” in a metal tube in the sky. But when we stepped into the airport, Max immediately went to work — calmly walking beside him, guiding him through crowds, offering gentle nudges when he started to fidget.

When the plane took off, my son squeezed my hand, then reached down to pet Max, who was already curled under the seat, eyes closed, tail still. By the time we landed, my son whispered, “I think Max likes flying.” It was a small sentence — but a massive moment of progress.

That trip reminded me why service animals are so much more than companions. They’re confidence, independence, and peace wrapped up in fur and loyalty.

#  Common Questions About Flying with a Service Animal

# Can airlines refuse my service dog?

They can **only refuse** if your dog:

* Shows aggressive or disruptive behavior 
* Is not properly trained or controlled 
* Poses a direct threat to health or safety 

# Do I need to buy a ticket for my service dog?

No. Service animals fly **free of charge** in the cabin with their handler.

# What about miniature horses?

Yes, miniature horses can qualify as service animals under the ADA, but not all airlines can safely accommodate them due to size restrictions. Always call ahead to check.

# Can my child handle their service animal on a plane?

It depends on their age and comfort level. Many parents act as handlers during flights, especially for children with autism or anxiety.

#  Final Thoughts: You’ve Got This

Flying with a service animal can seem intimidating at first, but with a bit of preparation, it’s absolutely manageable. Remember — your dog is trained for this, and **you are your best advocate**. Don’t be afraid to speak up, ask for assistance, or request quiet boarding if needed.

Each flight gets easier. Each experience teaches you something new. And at the end of the day, you’re not just traveling — you’re showing the world what inclusion and independence really look like.

So pack that vest, grab your paperwork, and give your service dog an extra pat. You’ve got this.

But one thing I am contemplating, and not sure if it is a good idea, is summiting Mauna Kea via VIS at the later part of our trip. (We will dive at the beginning of our trip, leaving a few days in between.)

We live in Colorado and I hike/climb/snowboard/ski regularly at high altitude. I also had experience w/ tropical island w/ snowy peaks when I was younger, working as a field biologist in Taiwan. Generally I am not worry about altitude condition & weather.

My only worry is that I will be hiking alone. My partner doesn't do well w/ high altitude hikes, so it will be just me. I am starting menopause recently so I know it may affect my fitness, there's that as well. 

Is the Mauna Kea trail usually pretty deserted? In Colorado, almost all of the standard route to summits are popular and I have summit alone feeling fine. Is it too big of a risk to hike by myself to the summit when I dive few days ago?

I wasn’t going to keep writing these.
The cops told me to stop talking about it online, and honestly, I didn’t want to think about it anymore.
But something feels wrong.
The officer who dropped me off keeps driving past my street. Same car, same time every morning. I know it’s him.
I just need to write this out once more. Maybe then it’ll make sense.

It was quiet when they found me. Too quiet. After hours of screaming, running, falling through branches and breath, the stillness felt fake, like the woods had gone still on purpose, waiting to see what I’d do next.

My body gave up before I did. My knees buckled somewhere near the road. Gravel shredded through my jeans and I hit the ground face-first. I remember thinking, stupidly, that the stones felt warm.

Then light. Bright and white and wrong.

A voice behind it: “Whoa there! Stop right there, son.” The beam of a flashlight washed across my face. Hands grabbed me, rough and gloved, hoisting me upright. Another voice, lower, muttering, “Christ. What the hell happened to this kid?” The first voice said, “We’ve got you, okay? You’re safe now.”

Safe. The word didn’t mean anything anymore.

A truck engine idled nearby. Blue and red lights pulsed across the trees, turning the branches into veins. My vision tunneled. Faces blurred, uniforms smearing together into dark shapes. One of them steadied me. I could smell his cologne through the mud and blood in my nose.

“Where’s the others?” he asked. His voice was careful. Too careful. Like someone trying to sound human.

“Sophie,” I whispered. “They… they got Sophie…”
“Alright,” he said softly, nodding, too calm. “We’ll sort that out. Let’s get you warm first.”

I tried to look him in the eye, but the flashlight glare cut across his face in a way that made it hard to tell what expression he was wearing. For a second, just a second, it looked like he was smiling.

Someone threw a blanket around me. The wool scratched my neck and soaked up the blood on my collar. I could hear the click of a penlight, the clatter of equipment, radio chatter behind the trees. I’d never realized how loud silence could be.

The air still smelled like the forest, damp leaves, mud, and something coppery that clung to my hands.
“Pulse steady,” a woman’s voice said. “Pupils reactive.”
A light flicked across my eyes.

Her face hovered in the blur, white coat, ponytail, tired eyes. “You’re okay,” she murmured, placing two fingers on my wrist. And then, under her breath, so softly I almost thought I imagined it, she started humming. That song. The same one they sang in the clearing. The lullaby.

My body froze. Every muscle locked up. The officer beside me must’ve felt it because his grip on my shoulder tightened. “Easy,” he said. “You’re in shock.” The medic didn’t notice. Or she didn’t care.

She kept humming as she pressed a gauze pad to my temple, like it was the most natural thing in the world. The tune wavered, sweet, steady, almost tender, until she caught my stare. Her lips stopped moving. Her eyes flicked up, met mine.

For a heartbeat her expression went completely blank. Like a mask.

Then it was gone. She blinked, smiled faintly, and said, “Vitals are good.” She packed up her kit and walked away. The humming had stopped, but the tune was still stuck in my head like a tick.

They helped me to my feet and led me toward the truck. The wheels hissed against the gravel. The red light kept flashing, painting the trees with color that didn’t belong in nature. I tried to speak again. My throat felt like sandpaper.

“Where are they?” I croaked. “Sophie. Tyler. Amanda.”
The officer didn’t answer. He just held the door open, nodded for me to get in.

His face didn’t look real anymore, too smooth, too composed, like every emotion was something he’d learned from a handbook. “We’ll take care of it,” he said. “You just need rest.”

Rest. My stomach lurched. I thought about Sophie’s body in that clearing. The blanket slipped off my shoulders as I bent forward and threw up on the gravel. No one moved. The officer just waited, patient as stone, until I was done. Then he guided me into the back seat.

The ride was slow. The heater hummed faintly. The air reeked of gasoline and iron. Every bump in the road sent a tremor through my knees. I leaned my head against the window and watched the forest slide by in reverse. The tree line swallowed the last of the siren lights. Darkness seemed to close back in behind us.

When I looked long enough, I thought I could still see the torches, dim orange dots in the distance. Flickering. Watching.

“You’re lucky we found you,” the officer said after a while. His tone was too even. “We got the call around three,” he added. “Said there was shouting out near Route 3, but when we went to check,” he paused, “place was empty.”

I turned toward him. “You didn’t see them?”
“See who?” he asked without looking back.
I didn’t answer. He didn’t need to.

The truck slowed as we left the woods. Morning was creeping in, thin gray light spilling over the horizon, mist lifting off the asphalt. I could see the Hopkinton Police Department stencil on the door when the driver stepped out to talk to someone beside another cruiser.

Their voices were muffled, low. One of them laughed. Then both heads turned toward me at the same time. I dropped my gaze, pretended to stare at the blanket on my lap.

When they came back, neither said a word. The truck started moving again, slower this time.

Through the windshield, I saw a small brick building ahead, floodlights, a radio tower, a faded flag flapping in the dawn wind.
“Almost there,” the officer said. “We’ll get you cleaned up.” His tone was soft. Comforting. Rehearsed.

The heater hummed. The smell of blood and dirt hung thick in the cab. The sun finally pushed over the horizon, pale and colorless, like a bulb dying out. For a moment, I let myself believe it was over.

Until the radio crackled, and through the static, I heard the lullaby again. Faint. Humming through the wires. Like it had never left the woods at all.

They brought me to a small brick building that looked more like a post office than a police station. Inside was all tile and fluorescent light, humming, endless, too bright to feel real. Someone led me past a desk, down a short hallway, into a room that smelled like burnt coffee and antiseptic.

“Just sit tight, okay?” the officer said. “We’ll get you something warm.” He left before I could answer.

The blanket itched. My skin crawled underneath it. Every sound felt too loud, chairs scraping, doors opening, a printer starting up somewhere in the building. I kept waiting for someone to ask what happened. Nobody did.

A clock ticked on the wall. I watched the second hand go around until the numbers stopped meaning anything.

When the door opened again, a man in plain clothes walked in. He looked like every detective from every local news broadcast: short sleeves, loosened tie, polite smile that didn’t reach his eyes.

“Colin, right?” he asked, pulling out a chair.
I nodded.
“You’re safe here,” he said automatically, like he’d said it a hundred times already.

He set a paper cup of coffee in front of me. The steam carried that same sour metallic smell I’d noticed in the truck. I didn’t touch it.

“So,” he said, flipping open a notebook, “you said there were others with you tonight?”
I told him their names. Sophie. Tyler. Amanda.
He nodded, pen scratching, not writing fast enough. When I stopped, he looked up.

“And you all went to the Enchanted Forest together?”
“Yeah,” I said. “We wanted to film. We—thought it’d be funny.”
“Right,” he said. “And what happened after that?”

I started talking. The words came out in pieces, like I was trying to rebuild a dream I didn’t want to remember. The lights. The chanting. The torches. Sophie’s scream. The clearing.

When I said the word cult, he blinked once. “Cult,” he repeated, testing it. Then wrote something down. “And you’re sure you saw this group perform a ritual?”
“I’m sure,” I said. “They killed her. They—”

My throat closed. He watched me quietly. “We didn’t find any evidence of that,” he said finally. “No bodies. No fire pits. No sign of anyone else.”

I just stared at him. “That’s not possible. You didn’t go deep enough, there was a—”
“We searched,” he interrupted gently. “It was empty.”

He closed the notebook. “You’ve had a traumatic night,” he said. “Shock can do strange things to memory. Maybe you saw shadows, or heard things that weren’t there. We’ll have an officer drive you home once you’ve warmed up.”

I opened my mouth to argue, then stopped. Over his shoulder, through the glass door, a cop set a clear evidence bag on a desk. Inside was a shoe. Sophie’s.

I blinked, and the cop picked up the bag and walked into another room. When I looked back, the detective was watching me.

“Everything alright?” he asked.
I nodded automatically.
He smiled faintly, stood, and said, “Someone will be with you shortly.” He left. The door clicked softly shut.

I sat there staring at the reflection of the overhead light in the tabletop. The coffee had gone cold. Somewhere down the hall, a printer started up again, that same rhythm as the lullaby. Print—click. Print—click. Print—click.

The smell of iron crept back in. I pulled the blanket tighter around me and realized it wasn’t the same one they’d given me in the truck. This one was different. It smelled like smoke.

The detective never came back. Someone else did. A uniformed officer I hadn’t seen before, tall, gray hair, expressionless, stepped into the room holding a clipboard. “We’re going to get you cleaned up, alright?” he said. Same cadence. Same words. You’re safe now. I wanted to tell him to stop saying that.

He led me down a narrow hallway to a locker-room-looking space with a sink and a metal bench. The fluorescent light buzzed louder here, like a swarm. A woman waited by the sink, holding a towel.

It took me a second to realize who she was. The paramedic.

Her hair was tucked under a cap now, uniform changed, but the eyes were the same. She smiled. “Glad to see you upright. You gave us quite a scare.” Her tone was polite. Her hands trembled slightly as she turned on the faucet. The water came out brown for a second before running clear.

“Go ahead,” she said. “Rinse off the dirt.”

I stepped forward, hesitating. The air smelled like bleach. And underneath it, smoke.

The towel she handed me was too warm, like it had been sitting on a radiator. When I wiped my face, I heard her humming again. The same lullaby. Slower this time.

I caught her reflection in the mirror. Her lips weren’t moving.

But the sound was still there. It was coming from the intercom speaker in the ceiling, faint, distorted, looping.

The officer didn’t seem to notice. He was busy filling out a form, murmuring dates and times under his breath. “Discovered approximately four-thirty a.m.,” he said.

But they’d found me closer to six. I opened my mouth to correct him, then stopped. He’d written it before I said anything.

When they finished, the officer handed me a paper cup of water and said I could wait in the lobby. The chairs were lined up in a row, vinyl cracked from years of use. A coffee machine hissed in the corner.

On the wall above the reception desk hung a framed photo, rows of smiling kids at a community day. I recognized one face. Tyler. Younger, maybe twelve. Wearing a paper crown from the park’s old Storybook Village attraction.

I stood up so fast the chair squealed. A receptionist behind the glass looked up. “You’re safe now,” she said automatically.

The words hit like a punch. I turned toward the door, hand shaking on the handle, and stopped when I saw muddy footprints on the tile.

Bare feet.

The prints led from the doorway to the hallway I’d just come from, then vanished. The receptionist kept typing, nails clacking out the rhythm of the lullaby.

I went back to the bench and sat down. The water cup shook in my hand. Through the glass doors I could see daylight now, flat, gray, Rhode Island morning. I told myself I just needed to wait for the ride home. Wait, and it would all be over.

But the printer behind the desk started again, that same click-whir pattern. When one of the officers walked past holding a manila folder, I caught a glimpse of the label:

EVIDENCE #03 - C.CONSTANT

I didn’t know what scared me more:
that they had a file on me,
or that there might’ve been two before it.

I don’t know how long I sat there. The clock on the wall didn’t make sense anymore. The second hand would move for a while, then stop. Then skip.

A shadow passed the frosted glass door, and the handle clicked open. The detective came back. Same shirt. Same loosened tie. Same calm smile that looked painted on.

“You holding up?” he asked. His voice was warm. Practiced. Like he’d been trained to sound exactly this concerned.

I nodded. He closed the door and sat across from me again. “We’ve been over the area,” he said. “Nothing out there but mud and old foundations.”

“You didn’t find them?”
“No.”

He said it gently, like the word itself needed to be handled carefully.
“And you’re sure that’s where you were?”
“I’m sure,” I said. “The Enchanted Forest. You know where it is.”

He hesitated, tapping the pen against his notebook. “It’s been closed for years,” he said. “Trespassing’s not uncommon. People get turned around out there. Lose track of where they are.”
“That’s not what happened.”
“I’m not saying it is.”

He smiled again, a little too fast, a little too wide. “You’ve had a traumatic experience, Colin. That kind of shock can make the mind fill in gaps. Turn fear into images. You might’ve—”
“I didn’t imagine it.”

The words came out sharper than I meant. He waited, patient, pretending not to be offended. “Okay,” he said. “Let’s not push anything right now.”

He flipped a page in the notebook, scanned something, then reached into his jacket pocket. When he pulled his hand back out, he was holding my phone. The same one I’d dropped when we ran.

Screen uncracked. Case clean.

“We found this near where you were picked up,” he said. “Good thing, too, might help us reach your parents.”

I took it. The battery said 82%. I hadn’t charged it since yesterday morning.

“Can I see the photos?” I asked.
“Photos?”
“The ones from that night. We filmed some of it. It should be on there.”
He gave a small, patient chuckle. “Nothing on there but a few messages,” he said. “You must’ve deleted them.”
“I didn’t.”
“Phones glitch. Memory corrupts. Happens all the time.”

He said it like he was reciting it. The hum of the lights grew louder, pressing against the inside of my skull. I looked down at the screen.

My lock screen photo, the one of me, Sophie, Tyler, and Amanda at the skate park, was gone. In its place was a blank gray background. Just one word in the middle:

SAFE.

I looked up, mouth dry.
“Did you—”
“We’ll have a unit drive you home soon,” he said, talking over me. “You’ll rest, see your family. Maybe in a day or two we can take another statement.”
“What about the others?”
“We’ll keep looking.”

He smiled again.
“You’re lucky, Colin. A lot of kids don’t make it out of those woods once night falls.”
His voice was soft, almost proud. Like I’d passed some kind of test.

He stood, straightened his tie, and opened the door. The hallway beyond was washed in light. “Get some rest,” he said. “You’re safe now.”

The door clicked shut behind him. The fluorescent hum swelled until it almost sounded like singing.

I unlocked the phone again. The background was still gray. A notification blinked at the top of the screen.

1 New Voicemail
Timestamp: 4:03 A.M.

No service, no missed call, just the voicemail.
I pressed play.
Static.
Then the lullaby.
Slow. Faint.

And under it, a whisper: “You made it home.”

I keep thinking about the way the cruiser smelled. That pine air freshener.

I bought the same kind today without realizing it until I got home. The scent filled the car and I felt calm for the first time in weeks. It was the same calm I felt right before everything started.

The detective’s voice, Hartley’s voice, they weren’t the same, but they said the same things. I don’t think they were lying. I think they were right.

I was safe.
I just didn’t understand what that meant yet.",1,1759880160.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1o0uunx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1o0uunx/finally_at_the_point_of_not_having_to_tip_toe/,Finally at the point of not having to tip toe around my home,"[tw] A few years ago I had a guy live in my apartment and we met and went out for coffee. Then we started hanging out and playing video games together. It was nice I thought I was making a new friend since I was new. 

Well he started knocking on my door to talk or hang out every once in a while which was fine at first. I would notice that sometimes I’d leave to go somewhere and he’d be on his way out too which happens ya know. 

But this started happening A LOT. It got to the point where I’d leave and be walking down the street and get the feel that someone was behind me and I’d stop and wait and sure enough he would walk past. It eventually would happen almost every time.

He started leaving his apartment door open. I thought maybe he just wanted fresh air or something along those lines but within a few weeks he would start knocking on my door every time he heard me moving around. Every. Time. If I didn’t answer he would try to corner me in the hallway next time and confront me about it. 

When we’d hang out he started subtly dropping vague threats that would pick up in intensity as time went on. 

The walls were thin so every time he’d hear me on the phone I could hear him walk up to my door and hear the floor boards creak as he would lean in to listen to my calls. I had to whisper so he wouldn’t hear me. Eventually I would have to use blankets and pillows to try to muffle the sounds of my voice even more. 

He would take mail from my mailbox and leave me notes that would either be left in my mailbox or shoved under my door. 

When we’d hang out he started subtly dropping vague threats that would pick up in intensity as time went on. I started being too busy to hang out which made things worse. 

Eventually this all got so bad that I couldn’t leave my apartment unless I was sure he was gone. I had to listen if he was sleeping or left to be able to go anywhere. I had to ration my food cause I couldn’t go to the grocery store. I also had to be super careful about making any sound while making food or washing dishes. It made it more difficult that I couldn’t pin point his sleep schedule cause it seemed sporadic. 

I decided I had to move to get away and thankfully he happened to be gone the day I brought the boxes to pack. But for weeks I had to slowly and very carefully pack all of my junk without making a sound. 

At one point I had to leave for some reason and I listened and didn’t hear him so I decided to venture out but when I opened the door he was standing in the hallway. I tried to close the door fast enough and subtly enough that he wouldn’t see the boxes but he noticed them anyway and started asking questions. I dodged them as best I could for as long as I could. Eventually I was cornered into telling him I was moving but told him I didn’t know where. He kept trying to ask where and trying to navigate where he thought I should go. He told me that he would walk miles and for hours. That he knew public transport people.

I had it arranged that I didn’t need to be there when the moving people came. I slept on the floor of my new apartment on a mat before I was supposed to have moved in to get away from this guy. 

I recently had an incident with a guy that made me feel like I was reliving this entire thing. I know I wasn’t really reliving it. They’re just memories but it really set me back. I kept trying to figure out what I could’ve possibly did wrong to cause it to happen so it’ll never happen again. It sent me on a spiral mixing with an OCD flare up.

I’ve noticed over the past year I’ve been more comfortable walking around more normal and not having to very slowly and carefully close cabinets and doors and being more normal about it. I still am very quiet and keep my tv low and whatnot but it’s mostly out of respect for my neighbors so I’m not being disruptive. 

I think this seems small but is actually very big for me to feel comfortable enough to take up space. ",2,1759879859.0,CPTSD,1,0.76,False

She wiped her clammy palm against her denim, her grip around the bag in her other hand tightening. She watched him for a second, either he hadn’t spotted her yet or he didn’t actually know what she looked like. The anxiety steadily gripped her as she considered turning back and walking away. For a second that seemed like the easier option yet the burning desire in her made her take a step forward. 


An awkward short wave, a much awkward handshake that she offered before leaning in for a hesitant hug reminded her that she was way out of her depth. 


“Can we grab a drink?”, she abruptly took a step back, an odd feeling running down her spine. 


“Now? At ten in the morning?”


“I meant a coffee”, she looked away. She didn’t trust herself to not do something stupid. And she needed space. 


“Not the room?”


“A coffee would be nice?”, she breathed out. She didn’t trust herself. 


When she felt his palm casually at her back as they waited near the counter to pick their coffee, she took a step away. She didn’t want him to see the goosebumps on her arms. 


For a second she was reminded of the very forward texts she had sent, none of which she knew she was capable of pulling off at this moment.


“Can we sit?”, she walked away to one of the tables twisting her lips at herself. 


“Now?”.


“Mmm hmmm”, she took a sip of the coffee trying not to look at him. 


Fuck this is awkward, she thought to herself. 


She fished out the chocolate box from her bag placing it on the table, “for you”.


“For me?”.


She clenched involuntarily, her mind reminding her of everything that was to come. She barely paid attention wondering why she was torturing herself. 


“You want to leave or?”.


“Yeah, we can leave”, she shrugged. 


“Ready?”.


“Mmm hmmm”, she picked her bag. 


“To be my slut?”


She rolled her eyes for him to see. She hated the word with every fiber of her being. Every single time she had been called a slut or a whore, it grated on her nerves. But every single time she had pressed her thighs together hoping he’d make it better. She almost hated herself for that. And it had driven her to say something bratty every single time. Yet today, she was almost mute. Almost. 


The door had finally clicked shut an insufferable traffic later. She looked around trying not to be bothered by the wetness between her thighs. She wondered if she needed to clean up her drenched self first. Would this not be too weird, she wondered. 


“Ready to obey?”.


The “no?” almost slipped out of her. It had become habit by now. She wanted to see how far she could push him. Every no uttered had been to see how far she could get on his nerves before he walked away. She was a sadist, alright. 


She took a breath in. 


The need to surrender to everything in his head made matters worse. She wanted to behave. She craved to please. She was determined to stay obedient. She wanted to hear that good girl. She wanted every single praise that his lips could muster that day. 


“Yes”, she gasped. The please that followed gave him the control she didn’t seem to  want anymore.

Hello everyone, I (21f) have started talking to this guy I met on an app. 

Honestly I was going through a lot, I needed to socialize a bit and found myself in his city nearly 2 weeks ago. We went for a coffee, went for a walk, went to shop together, he gave me peace despite all the storms have been happening in my life. 

Next week he invited me to a cinema and dinner, i had great time and he did as well. Since we live a bit far (25 kms, however public transport is not our best friend) we spend most of the time chatting during the day and we read and watch netflix online. We have a lot of common points, I really do feel like he is my male version somehow.

However, I feel very insecure about sex. I had sex with my ex too soon and he dumped me when he realized I can’t satisfy him enough since I am “tight” and I also bled through an intercourse. I am so scared of this happening and being embarrassed agajn. 

And just for some context, I had a condition called vaginismus, but yesterday officially I learned that I am healthy now in my gynecologist appointment.

Despite everything, I am scared that he will be turned off if he realizes I am bad at it and will lose interest. Or worse, i will also bleed with him as well😭

Can postponing sex secure a relationship? Or am I just being overreactive?

Wet.
Homeless.

Those three words clung to the guy who sat slumped outside my coffee shop in the afternoon rain.

Perfect. 

Thanks to the increasingly erratic weather, I had the privilege of seeing him in all kinds of seasonal wear: a short-sleeved tee and shorts in the late morning while he chewed on a bagel; later at lunch, sporting a jacket and baseball cap. 

Around then, when the sun scorched the sidewalk, he’d been uncomfortably bent over a dog-eared paperback. 

College student. Early twenties.

I couldn’t tell if he was enjoying the book, but he flipped through it quickly, head cocked, eyes glued to each page.

When I glanced out later while wiping down tables, the book was gone. 

He was curled up, pressed into a nest of soaked blankets, trying to hold onto what little warmth he could. 

A cheap plastic raincoat was draped over thick brown curls.

I found myself fascinated by him as the day crept on and he shifted positions. 

I made pastries, watching him with floury fingers, mesmerized as he sat, knees pressed to his chest, staring up at the sky. 

He sat up, then lay down, eventually curling into the fetal position, placing the book over his face.

I made the mistake of peeking out of the window while serving a patron. 

The boy lay on his side with his back to me, unmoving. 

I excused myself, grabbed a blanket from the back, and rushed outside. 

From my observations, he didn’t *seem* sick. 

I nudged him with my shoe, only to be met with a loud protesting groan. 

“I’m not *moving*,” he grumbled, curling further into a ball. 

He emphasized his words, yanking the covers tighter around himself. 

With a start, I realized his tone was something authentic that  I could appreciate, sardonic and deadpan, with a sliver of irony.

“I’m not doing anything wrong except existing, and I’m so sorry for my presence. If you touch me, you'll regret it.”

I pulled the blanket tighter around me, holding it close to my chest. ""Do you... want to come inside?""

He didn't respond for a moment, twisting around to face me, blinking rapidly through thick brown locks plastering his forehead. “Shit,” he muttered. “You're not Karen.”

I frowned. “Karen?”

“Karens,” he smirked. “Plural. They've been shooting me dirty looks all day.” 

He cocked his head, amused, maybe intrigued, maybe something entirely else. 

He did seem to suddenly care a lot about his hair, shaking it out of his eyes like a wet dog. 

“Did you… want something, dude?”

Up close, he wasn’t the type I expected to be homeless: attractive face, sharp jawline, wide brown eyes that reminded me of rich coffee grounds, and freckles speckling his nose. 

Having not lived in the human world for long, I had only just started to learn about societal norms and prejudices. 

He was too clean, hair neatly tucked under his hood and his nails clipped. 

His hygiene was intact, and though his clothes were crumpled, a loose pair of jeans and a jacket, they weren’t stained. 

I was kind of in awe.

This was a boy who took care of himself, even on the streets, and I couldn’t help but appreciate that. 

Perhaps it was vanity, or maybe just self respect. 

But then, maybe I had been staring at him for too long.

I was aware I was also soaked, my flimsy umbrella doing nothing to protect me from the vicious downpour, my own hair sticking over my eyes. 

The boy regarded me with amusement, tilting his head like a kicked puppy, his lips curled in something resembling a smirk. When I snapped to and offered the (now soaked) blanket, his expression darkened. 

I was so close to him, I could finally see what I couldn't from afar. When I was observing him from the window of my shop, he was an ordinary human. 

But now I could see his face. The one he tried to hide, ducking under his blankets and hidden behind cheap shades. 

I could see the hollowness in his eyes that was so cavernous, endless, with such prominent shadows and a smile lacking so much warmth that I struggled to fully comprehend the depths of this boy’s despair. 

I had never quite met a human like him before. Through expression alone, I could read a human face. 

I could see their wishes and dreams, their hopes for the future. But this one… He was *blank*. 

A nothing, a nobody; a terrifying, hollow shell of a human being. 

The best way I can describe it is like an aura blossoming around him, thick mist suffocating his thoughts, suffocating him. 

Squeezing the happiness from his brain. 

But looking at him, I wasn't sure this boy even knew what happiness was, or had ever known it. 

His entire being, his soul, his mark on this planet, was little more than a smear. 

Depression is what humans call it. We call it severing the will to live. 

Humans can learn to live with it by altering their brain chemistry. 

But to us, it's a death sentence.

Worse than the plague that wiped out my kind. The human boy was dripping in it. 

Drowning, but choosing not to break the surface. 

I stumbled back at the thought of it being contagious, my breath catching in my throat. He wasn't just depressed. 

His will to live was already severed, already withering as time cruelly crept on. 

This human boy wanted to die!

No, not just that. 

He was *going* to die. 

I saw eerie confirmation in dull eyes that didn't quite meet my gaze. 

He was planning his death. 

“What?” the boy’s lips broke out into a grin, and I found myself momentarily losing my mind. 

He shuffled forward, pulling his blankets tighter around himself. 

I had to refrain from stepping back. “What's with the glaring? Do I, like, have something on my face?”

I ignored his laugh. His entire world was still intact, every loved one alive and well, yet this human demanded a fucking pity party. It was pathetic. His smile was fake.

I knew my kind was not perfect. But we were self aware. 

Humans, however, were going in circles. This particular human was a walking contradiction. 

His attractiveness was a privilege; this boy was a child having a tantrum, crying out to the “unfair” world, and as a protest for not being heard, he was going to take his own life. 

I wished my family had that privilege. I wished they could *choose* to die, instead of coughing up their internal organs and suffocating in their own blood. 

I could feel my blood rising, shivers skittering up and down my spine. 

I had sat with my mother for three days straight. She died on the first day, and I held her, cradling her to my chest. 

Mom didn't want to die. 

She wanted to live. Jun, my sister, who died crying, died coughing up her own ravaged lungs, wanted to *live.* 

This boy was a *coward.* His whole kind were cowards. 

I almost turned and left him, my teeth gritted, my stomach crawling into my throat, revulsion filling my mouth. I had already made my choice with Blue. 

I had made my choice with him two weeks earlier, when he first slumped down on the bench outside my shop and shot me a friendly smile through the window. 

I couldn’t back out, no matter how much the human boy repulsed me. 

Backing out would mean breaking my last promise to Blue. 

“Do you want to come inside?” I asked him. “Coffee is on me.”

I wasn't sure I liked the way his eyes raked me up and down as he arched a brow. He offered me another soulless smile with too many teeth. “I'm pretty good here, man.”

I nodded, maintaining my smile. “What's your name?” I asked. “I'm Jules.”

His smile curled into a grimace, and I took the hint to back away. The human boy’s expression reminded me of a cornered animal. 

He did the head-tilt thing again, but this time there was a little too much emphasis. 

""I'm sorry, did I fall into an alternate universe where I'm supposed to give strangers my name?"" he demanded.

Jeez, he had mean girl vibes. That’s what Blue called it, anyway. 

When I didn’t, or couldn’t, respond, the boy waved a hand with an eye roll, like I was a stray cat. 

“Bye.” His icy glare followed me, brown eyes not as cozy and warm up close as I’d thought. “Stop stepping on my fuckin’ blanket,” he snapped. 

I detected the slightest accent, like that of a Brit who had lived in the States for most of his life. 

I refused to give up on him. He was an asshole, sure, but he was also vulnerable. He was my second choice, picked from his facial expressions alone. He was so human. That’s what I wanted. 

""Just a coffee,” I said. “You don't have to talk to me. You can sit there, drink it, and then get the fuck out if you want to. But it's raining, and you're soaked, and now I'm soaked, so stop being an *ass* and come inside before I change my mind.” 

I lifted my shoe from where it had been treading on his blanket, twisted around, and walked away. 

About half an hour later, while I was making drinks for the usual crowd of college kids, he appeared like a specter, soaked through, water dripping from his clothes, peering through the door with wide eyes like a startled deer. 

While he squelched his way toward the counter, three customers abandoned their drinks, making a quick exit. 

Instead of making him coffee, I grabbed him, ignoring his, “Woah, hey! *ow!*” and led him upstairs to my tiny apartment above the shop, pressing a towel and a change of clothes into his arms. 

“This is technically kidnapping,” he muttered. “What, are you planning on dragging me down to your BDSM cellar?”

“Get changed.” I said. 

The guy blinked twice. “I was joking—”

“You're wet.” I snapped. “Get changed.”

He folded his arms stubbornly. “Why should I? It's a free country.”

“This is my business,” I hissed, tossing him my bathrobe and shampoo. “You’re not standing there dripping all over my floors.”

He looked like he might argue, before his eagle eyes found Blue’s bath bombs in the pockets of my robe. 

Something sour crept into my throat. I thought I got rid of all her things. 

The guy pulled them out, painfully slowly, cupping them in his hands with a smirk. “Does someone else live here?”

“Not anymore,” I muttered. 

“Oh?” He raised a brow. This guy was childish for his age. “Sooo, like, you were dating someone?”

I shook my head. “She was a friend.”

I turned away from him before I could show any emotion. 

“Gotchaaaaaa.” The boy said, laughing. “She was a friend? So, wait, were you like—”

“Friends.” I said. “She wasn't my type.”

Blue was a hard subject. Leaving him to shower, I returned to my shop. Every customer was gone; their drinks were still lukewarm as I dumped them in the sink. 

He appeared a little later on, hair still damp and fluffy, wearing one of Blue’s sweaters and a scuffed pair of jeans. 

He took an uncertain seat and I made him our special.

Brewed coffee beans, ice-cold milk, and a sprinkle of my secret ingredient. 

I noticed him watching me as I worked, chin resting on his fist, head cocked, legs swinging, kind of like a human child. 

“One Bloomshot Brew,” I said, adding extra cream and sliding it across the counter with a smile. 

“Enjoy!”

He stared down at the drink. 

“Uhh, what is it?”

“Coffee.” I deadpanned. 

I watched him take a hesitant sip, and just like that, his walls began to crumble, his expression softening into a smile as he downed the whole thing. 

He wasn't quite happy; I’d say he was more comforted. This boy was constantly on guard, always looking for danger. 

Now, though, I watched his resolve splinter with every sip. The coffee was specifically made to hit every taste bud. 

“Wow,” he said with a surprised laugh. “That’s, uhh, that's actually pretty good.”

He drank the dregs and, just as I thought, met my gaze hopefully. I was already making him another, sliding it over, and he downed the whole thing. 

On his third drink, the boy told me his name, giddy, licking froth from his lips. 

Just a few more, and he'd start talking. 

You see, I designed my coffee with three things in mind. 

I wanted to know names, stories, and get them to just the right amount of comfort. 

“I'm Ciaran, by the way,” he said. I made him a fourth coffee, this time our weekend special, Rose and Pine latte. He drank without even questioning it. 

“Jules.” I introduced myself again. “No offence,” I said, leaning forward, copying his demeanor, resting my chin on my fist. 

“But you look like you're carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders.”

Ciaran shrugged with a sheepish smile. He was on drink number five. 

Which meant I was close. He sighed, resting his face in his arms. 

“I don't really talk to strangers, but you seem cool,” he lifted his head. 

“So I guess I'm accidentally pouring my life out to you.” He chuckled, but his eyes darkened, gaze dropping to the counter. 

“I lost my parents when I was a kid,” he muttered. “Car crash, or whatever.""

His eyes were suddenly so hollow. 

""I survived, and all I remember is everything being upside down, a red streak of blood across the road—and the radio was still blasting 80s music. We crashed in the middle of nowhere in the English countryside.""

""When they pulled me out of the wreck, I saw my mom’s head on the side of the road, and she was still fucking smiling.”

His smile was faraway, dreamlike, his eyes hollow and vacant, like he'd already given up. Something sour crept up my throat. 

It was familiar. The feeling of drowning but not wanting to resurface. I felt it too. 

I felt it with Mom, and Jun. That's what it was, I thought.  Trauma. The human boy was suffering from *trauma*.

I had only felt trauma, but now I was seeing it in pasty, sunken cheeks, and tired eyes that didn't want to live; didn't *want* to have a soul. 

He straightened up and slid his cup over for a refill. I obliged, though my hands weren't supposed to be shaking as I steamed the milk. Trauma. 

That was the nothing in his eyes, the vacant cavern in his soul, the reason behind his insistence on severing his will to live. I had been through the exact same thing. 

“Anyway, I was adopted, and my adoptive parents were fucking assholes. I wasn't a son, I was a servant. They were crazy. Locked me in my room and refused to feed me.” 

His lip curled. “So, I left and I've been living on the streets ever since.” 

His frown splintered into a slight smile, and I knew that smile. I knew that kind of agony. It was endless. Monotonous. 

A dull, pounding pain wrapped around your bones, and it would never go away. Healed  or not, it would never leave. 

Ciaran wore that smile proudly, finishing his seventh coffee. “I have a pretty concrete plan for what I'm going to do.”

The words left my mouth before I could bite them back. 

“You're… going to...” I didn't have to say it. 

He surprised me with a snort. Maybe the drinks were stronger than I thought.

""Well, yeah,"" he laughed. ""It's either so warm I feel like I'm baking, or cold enough to make me wonder if I'll make it through the night. People are judgmental and fucking cruel, and I am so fucking tired. I miss my parents, man. I miss my home.""

He met my gaze, wide brown eyes filling with tears he tried to swipe away with his sleeve. His eyes had lost their voice a long time ago, probably when his parents died. 

I understood. I understood his exhaustion, his willingness to let go. But I had made my choice too. 

Weeks ago, when I first glimpsed him through the window, head tipped back, smiling at the sun with wide, wondrous eyes. 

He was the perfect human, even with his flaws, even with his will to live so weathered, and no matter how hard he tried, I wasn't letting him go. 

Instead of speaking, I poured him another drink. 

Coffee number eight. 

It wasn't actually coffee. I was just making steamed milk. 

He drank the whole thing. 

He shuffled closer, lowering his voice, his warm breath tickling my cheeks. 

""Between you and me?” he murmured. “I'm going to throw myself off the old bridge,"" he scoffed. ""The perfect ending to a sad life.""

“Come work for me,” I said too quickly, my stomach rising into my throat. “I’ve got a spare room in my apartment if you want to crash, and I can offer a decent wage.”

Ciaran’s smile was unsurprisingly warm. The coffee was already in his system, lowering his inhibitions.

His pupils were starting to expand. 

“I’m pretty set, man,” he said, leaning over the counter to offer a high five. I hesitated before slapping his palm, and he chuckled, drawing back. 

“Thanks, man. Really. I appreciate you trying to help, but you’re not going to change my mind. I made my choice when I turned eighteen.” 

Ciaran dragged his thumb around the rim of his coffee cup, his expression crumpling. 

“I gave myself five years to be happy.” He shrugged, and I wondered if he *wanted* to find that something, but never did. 

That was the reason why the human had given up. 

He sighed. “I mean, I've been happy, sure. But I can’t quite find something worth staying for, y’know?” 

His expression was peaceful, like he was content to walk out of my shop and straight into the path of a truck. He shot me a smile that I knew wasn't a smile. 

It was a goodbye. 

Ciaran groaned, his head dropping into his arms. “I want to see my parents again.”

I fought to keep him talking, leaning forward. I was so close. But this was the hardest part. Getting consent. “Ciaran.”

The boy didn't move, content with his face buried in his arms. “Mm?”

“I have a spare bed,” I started to say, before a loud clang cut me off. I twisted around to the shelves behind me, filled with brightly colored bell jars. 

One in particular was moving on its own, subtly sliding toward the edge. I picked it up and peered inside. 

From an outsider's perspective, I was holding a jar with a single lightning bug, a flickering light.

But looking closer, the light bled into the shape of a tiny girl floating on her back, eyes closed, dark brown hair billowing around her. 

I gave the jar a violent shake, and the light glowed brighter, bouncing from one side to the other. 

I heard her sharp squeak, before she dropped to the bottom. 

“What's *that*?”

I turned, still holding the jar. 

Ciaran was halfway across the counter, wide eyes glued to the jar. 

I tucked her away quickly, ignoring her angry buzzing.

“I collect lightning bugs.”

Ciaran rested his chin on his fist, lips curving into a smirk. “Like, fireflies?”

“Kind of.”

He laughed, and it was a good laugh— a real laugh. 

“Dude, how old are you again?”

Out of the corner of my eye, I caught  her glowing brighter, on purpose, trying to catch his attention. It was working. 

Her light was expanding across the jar, and the human boy was already hypnotized, specks of gold reflecting in his eyes. 

Ciaran leaned in, transfixed. “Can I see?” he whispered. 

“I’ve never looked at one this close before.” 

He reached for the jar before I could stop him, pressing his face against the glass. 

There was so much childlike wonder in his eyes, I didn't move to take it off of him. “Whoa,” he breathed, tracing her tiny buzzing light with his finger. 

“Where’d you find it?” 

He gave the jar a gentle shake. This time, she didn’t make a sound, just curled tighter at the bottom, wings folded behind her, head tucked in her arms. 

I snatched it back before he could unscrew the lid and set her free. 

“In the forest,” I said, turning, and placing her back on the shelf. I started to make him his final coffee, but the boy was already standing up and stretching. 

“All right, well, thanks for the coffee and sweater,” he said with a grin. “Can I keep the sweater? It's actually, like, crazy comfortable.”

I nodded, hoping I could keep him talking. But he really was leaving. I even picked up the bell jar to try to catch his attention again, like a moth to a flame. 

But this human was smarter than I thought.

I panicked when he grabbed his backpack, offering me a two-fingered salute. “Can you do me a favor, Jules?”

I found my voice, my chest tight. If I didn't get his consent within the next ten minutes, we were both in trouble. “Ciaran—”

“Please don’t follow me. Look, you’re the sweetest guy I’ve ever met, and I’m pretty sure if I wasn’t like this, I’d take you up on your offer.”

He sneezed into his sleeve, and my gut twisted. It was soft, barely even a sneeze. Ciaran swiped his nose, rolling his eyes. “Sorry. Allergies, I think.” he settled me with a wide smile that was at peace. 

“Believe me, the worst thing you can do is force me to stay. I said I’m fine, and, funnily enough, I’m actually happier than I’ve ever been.” Ciaran reached the door. 

He sneezed again, wrinkling his nose. I noticed him stumble slightly.

I was already moving toward him. I had minutes. “Sounds like you’re getting sick.”

“Yeah.” Ciaran sneezed again, this time violently, enough to jerk his body. 

He didn't see the streak of blood on his palm, swiping it on his jeans. 

He met my gaze, and I could already see it, an ignition of gold speckling his iris. “Probably the rain.”

He left the store, sneezing again, spraying blood tinged gold across the glass door. I watched as he stumbled forward. 

Two unsteady steps, swaying left and then right,  before his body gave up, and he hit the concrete face-first. 

His first wail was agonizing. I was paralyzed. I had seen it before, but not like *this*. 

His body was already twisting and contorting, head jerking left to right, bloody chunks spilling from his lips. 

The streets were empty when I pushed open the door. I counted down in my head, my own hands trembling. 

Ciaran forced himself upright, but his body was already rejecting human norms, his head hanging, as he choked up slithering red. 

Ciaran was the first one I had turned without consent, and if I didn't get it, I would be dealing with a dark fairy, a human turned fae with their consciousness intact, their magic unpredictable and twisted, their soul scorched. 

Dark fairies were the reason my world collapsed, why my family was dead. 

I forced myself to stay calm. The human boy could still be saved with his own words. That's why I chose him. 

But when I reached him, his eyes were unfocused and wrong, glassy, with no reflection. I was wrong about him, I thought dizzily, retrieving a blanket and scooping him into my arms. 

Ciaran *did* have a soul. I was selfish and judgemental. 

He sneezed again in my arms, choking up a chunk of his lung. 

Fuck. Lungs meant it was deep enough to begin shaping his heart. 

Ten minutes without consent. 

That’s when the body begins to change as usual. From that point, the clock was ticking. Dark fairies were created from their freedom being stripped away and their inability to choose. 

I managed to carry him back into the shop, just as he screamed, raw, guttural, agonized, His body convulsing so violently that I dropped him. 

His skin was translucent, and I could *see* the change already ripping its way through his body. 

“Ciaran,” I whispered, gently stroking his hair. I was feverishly aware of his eyes flickering, a bright yellow hue expanding across his pupils. 

His human soul was burning. I forced him to look at me, grasping his cheeks. He did, his head lolling to one side. 

“You told me you want to die. But what if I offered you a new life?”

""Fuck you,"" he groaned, rolling onto his side. 

The heart came next, slipping from his mouth in wet, slimy tendrils of glistening crimson. His voice was a hoarse cry. ""What did you put in that coffee?""

""Ciaran, I'm being serious,"" I hissed, my voice betraying me. ""You have to say yes. That's all you need to say.""

“So, you drugged me?” he slurred. 

“I'm trying to help you.”

""Get away from me,"" he snarled. ""Get the fuck away from me!""

I held him, cradling his jerking head in my lap. There were two ways I could go. 

With no consent, I could either kill him with raw iron straight through the heart before he could turn, or... I tried one more time, begging him to say a single word. 

It was a verbal contract, a choice he was making. Instead of responding, he spat all over my face.

""Go fuck… yourSELF! I don't want you anywhere near me. Get away from me!” the boy tried to get up, tried to help himself, but his body wasn't working. “Please,” he whispered. He was panicking. Pleading. I felt it like a cold, suffocating wave coming over me. “I was wrong. I don't want… I don't want to fucking die—”

“That's why I'm saving you!” I choked out. “Ciaran—”

He was crying, tears sliding down his cheeks. “Please. Let me go home, and I won't say anything. I won't tell anyone—”

His words erupted into a screech that sent his body into an arch. I ran out of time.

""I'm sorry,"" I whispered in his ear—and I was sorry. It was a method that would usually earn me the death penalty. But my species was dead. There was nobody left to punish me. The correct way to turn a human was by dosing them over the course of a few hours, which I had done with him. Dosing had its limitations. It required verbal consent from the human to ensure a mutual turning. If a human was turned forcefully, a dark fae was born. 

The alternative, albeit heavily controversial, method was through ingesting fae blood, which stopped the transformation into dark fae. 

I had grown up learning about the dark fae creating armies of changelings through non-consensual turnings. Without thinking, I bit into my wrist, ripped it open, and forced it into his mouth. Fae blood was the only thing that could stabilize him. 

“No,” he muffled when I tried to force him. “No!”

""Ciaran, please,”  I tried again. “You have to accept it,"" I hissed. But he spat it out, his eyes rolling back to pearly whites. 

When he didn’t respond, I watched his facial structure begin to change, the flesh on his back rippling beneath his shirt. His body went still for a moment, limbs slack, head lolling. I shuffled back, knowing what came next. Wings burst from bloody flaps of flesh oozing golden light, protruding through his spine. His wings were exactly what I expected: too fragile, like they were made of paper, singed at the edges. 

His hand jerked, and above me, the lights flickered.

The sound of shattering glass barely fazed me as I watched Ciaran’s body begin to change. 

Just then, an angry buzzing light hit me in the face. 

I waved her away, and she zipped over to Ciaran, glowing brighter as she shifted into a human form, landing gracefully. Her eyes were wide, lips parted. Blue knelt beside the boy, cradling his cheeks as blood pooled from his nose and mouth. She shot me a glare, and I sighed. ""I don't think you want to see this,"" I told her. She stayed stubbornly, and I rolled my eyes. ""It's not just a fairy transformation,"" I said, as blood leaked from every orifice. 

He was in the final stage. 

""It's a dark fairy. He didn't consent to be turned, so I can either kill him before he turns, or let him be reborn as—” 

I stopped when Blue tilted her head, blinking at me in confusion. She had no fucking idea what I was talking about.

""Just grab his legs,"" I said, and she did, grasping his ankles. 

His wings reminded me of smoldered glass as they fluttered erratically.

When his skin became too hot to touch, I dropped him just as Blue let out a squeak, stumbling back. 

In the time it took for me to take several steps back, squeezing my eyes shut, something warm and wet hit my face. 

I opened my eyes, and there he was, or *wasn't*. 

Ciaran was gone. In his place, shredded human flesh. 

I dropped to my knees next to the human skin, shifted it aside, and plucked out a tiny dim golden light. 

He was limp and covered in blood, his wings like knives cutting my palm. 

When I poked him, he rolled onto his front. I could see his chest moving, hear his bitty breathy gasps. Blue peered at him, her eyes wide, lips spread into a small smile. 

But she was crying. I picked up a fresh jar, and dropped the boy inside. Ciaran landed with a *thud*, but he didn't move. Fae borns were to be preserved in fairy dust for three days. I had no idea what was next for a dark fae. I was in uncharted territory with Ciaran. I filled the jar, transfixed by the tiny fairy floating, up, up, up, arms dangling, hair haloed around him. 

I screwed the lid on, and gave him a shake for good measure. 

The boy dropped to the bottom before slowly sitting up, burning eyes settled on me. His wings were scorched, bloodied eyes and curled lips like he was already summoning magic. “Let me out, asshole.”

His cry was bitty, more of a squeak. Laughable. 

“Let me fucking out!”

The lights flickered above, the floor cracking under my feet. I shook the jar again, and he glowed brighter, an angry little firefly pounding itty bitty fists. He toppled over, wings first, before diving to his feet, slamming his fists against the glass. “Let ME OUT YOU PIECE OF—”

I placed him back on the shelf, his cries muffling into soft squeaks. 

He was perfect. Beautiful. 

Exactly what I imagined.

I usually go with chia pudding, but I decided to try something different this week: *Easy Matcha Overnight Oats*.

The combo of oats + matcha sounded kinda weird at first, but it actually turned out creamy, lightly sweet, and had that earthy matcha kick that makes it feel a little fancy for a weekday breakfast.

Here’s how I did it:

**Ingredients**

* ½ cup rolled oats
* 1 tsp matcha powder
* 1 tbsp chia seeds (for extra thickness)
* ¾ cup plant milk (I used oat milk)
* 1–2 tsp maple syrup
* Optional toppings: banana slices, coconut flakes, or berries

**Steps**

1. Whisk the matcha with a splash of warm water first (otherwise it clumps).
2. Mix everything in a jar or container.
3. Leave it in the fridge overnight.
4. Add toppings in the morning and you’re good to go.

It’s been a nice change from my usual breakfast—super quick and gives a little caffeine boost without needing coffee.

Curious if anyone here has tried adding protein powder or nut butter to overnight oats? I’m wondering if it messes with the texture too much.",1,1759879085.0,VeganRecipeVault,0,1.0,False

FADE IN:

EXT. WONKA CHOCOLATE FACTORY – DAWN

Sunlight glitters off sugar-glass windows. A peppermint-striped chimney sighs cocoa steam into the pink morning sky.


---

INT. GRANDPA JOE’S SUITE – SAME TIME

A marshmallow mattress deflates slightly as GRANDPA JOE springs upright in a velvet dressing gown.
CHARLIE lies half-asleep under a candy-floss blanket.

GRANDPA JOE
Up we get, Charlie-boy! The dawn of a new era! There’s work to be done, sweets to be tasted, and perhaps—just perhaps—a teensy raise for your dear old grandpa!

CHARLIE
(grumbling)
We don’t even have wages yet.

GRANDPA JOE
Splendid! No paperwork. I like this management style already!

He pats his hair, grabs a cane made of peppermint, and marches out.


---

INT. MAIN FACTORY FLOOR – MOMENTS LATER

WILLY WONKA waits beside a group of solemn OOMPA-LOOMPAS.
He holds a ring of twelve fudge-flavoured keys.

WONKA
Charlie, the whole delicious disaster is yours. Twelve rooms, twelve flavours. Try not to eat the evidence.

He tips his hat; the air fills with pink candyfloss, and when it clears, Wonka has vanished.

CHARLIE
(staring at the keys)
He’s really gone.

GRANDPA JOE
Then there’s only one sensible thing to do—quality control!

He charges off toward the nearest corridor.


---

MONTAGE – “QUALITY CONTROL”

• Joe devours marshmallow pillows, cheeks bulging.
• He dips a ladle into a barrel of rainbow sherbet, nodding like a connoisseur.
• He slips into the chocolate river; Oompa-Loompas reel him out with a peppermint hook.
• He shakes off the cocoa and declares:

GRANDPA JOE
Just testing viscosity! Perfectly safe!


---

INT. TOFFEE LOUNGE – LATE MORNING

Joe lounges behind a counter now labelled “Cigars & Caramels Lounge – Adults Only.”
He puffs on a stick of cinnamon that smokes gently.

CHARLIE
That’s for the air-ducts, Grandpa!

GRANDPA JOE
Multi-purpose, my boy. Ambience and aroma!

He lifts a bubbling flute of Fizzy Lifting Tonic.

GRANDPA JOE (cont’d)
To innovation!

He drinks. His feet lift an inch off the floor.

INT. INVENTING ROOM – AFTERNOON

Gears spin. Steam hisses. Joe, dusted head-to-toe in icing sugar, punches random buttons.

CHARLIE
Please don’t touch anything—

GRANDPA JOE
Nonsense! How do you think progress happens? Accidentally!

A machine erupts in golden toffee foam.
The Oompa-Loompas duck for cover as caramel rains down.

INT. GOLDEN HALL – LATER

The lights shift to that familiar xylophone motif.
The OOMPA-LOOMPAS assemble in formation and begin to sing.

---

OOMPA-LOOMPA SONG – “THE SWEET-TOOTHED SHIRKER”

> Oompa, Loompa, doompa-dee-dee,
We’ve got another story for thee.
Oompa, Loompa, doompa-dee-doo,
How would you act if the factory’s new?

What do you get when you sample all day?
Dipping your fingers in fudge and parfait?
Sneaking a taste of the toffee and cream,
Snoozing while others all scrub and steam?
Lazy?  We think so too!

Oompa, Loompa, doompa-dee-dum,
Work can be sweet if you’re not a bum.
If you stay honest, steady, and true,
You’ll live in happiness too—

Like the Oompa, Loompa, doompa-dee-do!



Joe applauds enthusiastically.

GRANDPA JOE
That’s the spirit! Team morale!

Charlie sighs, wiping syrup from his hair.


---

INT. LICORICE HALL – EVENING

Joe reclines in a hammock made of black licorice, snoring softly.
A half-empty bottle of Fizzy Lifting Tonic drifts beside him.

CHARLIE
Grandpa, everyone’s cleaning up.

GRANDPA JOE
Delegation builds character. Wake me when the profits roll in.

He turns over, mumbling.

GRANDPA JOE (cont’d)
Tomorrow… the brandy truffle line…

Charlie looks forlorn, pulls a candy-floss blanket over him, and tiptoes away.

Two OOMPA-LOOMPAS watch from the shadows.

They shake their heads and walk off as the lights dim and the chocolate river hums a lullaby.

INT. INVENTING ROOM – NIGHT

A single desk lamp glows.
Joe, wearing safety goggles far too large, scribbles furiously beside jars marked “Highly Experimental.”

GRANDPA JOE
Eureka! Instant Candy Coffee! Keeps you perky for days…

He pops a crystal in his mouth; his eyes widen, pupils sparkling like sugar.

Joe hums at breakneck tempo, labels a jar “GRANDPA JOE’S ENERGY GOBSTOPPERS.”

GRANDPA JOE

1o0uipb,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1o0uipb/ex_rental_agreement_and_property/,Ex rental agreement and property,"I shared an apartment with my partner for about a year. Before signing the lease, I made sure both of our names were included to protect myself, as there were already some concerns. Over time, things became difficult—both with work and in our relationship. A few months ago, she left to find work or “find herself,” but at the time, she said she planned to return.

While she was gone, I suffered a life-changing injury, and with everything going on, we ended things abruptly. Now, due to my disability, I need to move out.

My first concern is that she left a lot of her belongings behind—items like a brand-new TV, TV stand, coffee table, queen bed, childhood dressers, IKEA furniture, and various kitchenware. I asked her to take them when she left, but since she planned to come back, I didn’t push it. She’s made no effort to contact me, other than one missed phone call months ago. I don’t want to keep or dispose of her things unfairly, but I’m not sure what the right or legal thing to do is.

My second concern is financial. Over the year we lived together, she only paid rent once. I even gave her another month free as a gift. Would she still be legally responsible for the unpaid rent? The total amount owed would be just under the small claims court limit. She has acknowledged responsibility in a text as well.

At this point, I’d honestly prefer to have someone else handle this on my behalf, as I don’t want any direct contact with her. I hold no animosity toward her, but our time together left me with a lot of emotional trauma. Time is running out before I have to move, and I’m unsure where to start.

My mom divorced my dad and moved us from Maryland all the way to New Mexico (where my mom was from, before i even existed). My mom said ""this is your aunt"" and I just accepted it lol if you're Mexican, you know. So anyway, I suddenly had this huge family of Mormons and I loved it. 

My mom never bought into but let me and my twin get baptized. I was active maybe less than a year before we left the state. Never really went back as an adult until last year... at 34 years old

I crossed paths with one of Auntie's sons and we started dating. He told me that he was trying to get back into church and i thought, maybe i need to do that too. So we did it together and married a few months later because that's what Mormons do i guess...

Anyway.. my now husband grew up in the church. Left for like 30 years and went back. We both were basically just starting over. I got a calling, my 13 yr old son got baptized and we were quite honestly miserable. 

Last night my husband and I had a good talk (he's known Ive been having my doubts for a few weeks now) and figured out that we were miserable because we are trying to be perfect.. something we will never be. 

Im just starting to see how truly messed up he is from growing up in the church and why he left as a teen. 

We are newlyweds and miserable because we were both trying to be perfect instead of ourselves. When we were dating i was inactive, no longer in active additcion but doing okay...i was in love with reading, coffee and nicotine. I loved to jam out, love horror movies and gothic art. Once we started going to church i lost my identity. I was trying to fit in with these people that i have nothing in common with. I lost myself, therefor my husband almost lost the person he fell in love with. 

Ive decided to step away and I think he is going to as well. 

This is a fresh decision and I'm not sure HOW we're going to do it 😬
Ive already told a friend (bishopric, 1st counselor or whatever) about my doubts and that I no longer want my calling. But now what? If I know one thing, I know that its like a spiderweb and I cant ghost the entire church. They will come find me 🤣

If you made it through my story, congratulations 🎊

However, getting my level up to a high A2 to low B1 is being a real pain particularly for listening. 

Everyday, I listen to at least 1-2 podcasts/videos such as coffee break french, slow french stories, comprehensible input (the A2 memes videos) and those youtube stories where they tell it three times, one with subtitles, one with translation and one without anything.

This was great when accessing stuff in the A1-A2 level and I can follow along with relative ease. 

But the A2 - B1 level content feels like a big jump.  For example, I’m really struggling with the longer dialogues at a slightly quicker pace. I feel as if I need thinking time between sentences and by the time I’ve done that I’ve missed a bunch. I’ve stepped away from Duolingo for the most part but still use it for the stories and listening radio bits. And their A2 french listening clips can be difficult for me. I probably on average understand around 50% (sometimes less) of whats being said in the clip. I’m trying to translate less in my head but it’s really difficult to actually understand without translating french to English. It also doesn’t help that I will understand a lot more if there are subtitles because reading has always been my strongest area. However, I am trying to minimise using subtitles so I don’t do what I did in school with Spanish and have a big discrepancy between reading and listening levels. 

I suppose A1  going into A2 has felt more of a building block exercise where the A2 going into B1 feels like a jump.

What really worked for me was structuring my practice around skills and real-life scenarios, and I used ChatGPT to simulate conversation, correct mistakes, and give me practice exercises. Here are some of the things I did:

1. Direct Object Pronouns Practice
I would ask ChatGPT: “Can you give me 4 questions one at a time and I’ll answer with direct object pronouns?” This gave me tons of mini-conversations that felt very natural.

2. Reflexive Verbs and Daily Routines
I practiced routines by pretending ChatGPT was my parent asking: “¿Ya te levantaste? ¿Te duchaste?” and I would answer using reflexive verbs. It really helped cement the pronouns and conjugations.

3. Past Tense (Preterite) Practice
I retold stories or even Harry Potter passages using only the preterite. I’d prompt: “Let’s retell Harry Potter using preterite verbs only. Correct me as I go.” This pushed me to think actively about past tense verbs.

4. Real-Life Scenarios
I would simulate real-life situations, like ordering in a restaurant: “Pretend you’re a waiter and I’m a customer. I’ll place my order in Spanish.” Or visiting the doctor: “Pretend you’re a doctor and I’m the patient. I’ll describe my symptoms.”

5. Numbers, Time, Weather, and Directions
I even practiced numbers and phrases like “Hace calor” or “El teléfono está encima de la cama”, which made me more confident using Spanish in practical situations.

Results

I can comfortably talk about my daily routines, past experiences, and my family.

I’ve mastered direct object pronouns in conversation.

I can handle simple conversations about the weather, directions, shopping, and restaurants.

I feel confident in reading and understanding short passages.


Honestly, the biggest game-changer has been the interactive nature of ChatGPT. It’s like having a tutor available 24/7, giving immediate feedback and corrections.

*Did I use Chatgpt to write that? Yes, yes I did. I've seen so many posts about how Chatgpt is not reliable but I can't believe how fast I've improved. I've been trying to listen to the Duolingo Spanish podcast off and on for years. The best I've been able to do is to catch a few words. Literally after less than 2 months with Chatgpt, I can understand every word (at 0.7 speed but still!). I even understood part of a Bad Bunny song the other day. I can't speak to other languages but for Spanish, ChatGPT has been spot on (I can check with my Spanish speaking friends and Chatgpt has gotten things right more than any other source). I'm also listening to the coffee break Español podcast, the duolingo Spanish podcast, and using Babbel. Babbel is awful for learning but organized really well so I use ChatGPT to practice whichever concept that Babbel is trying to ""teach"" me. Anyways, just thought I would share.

1o0ubkd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o0ubkd,I spilled iced coffee on my headphones,"This might sound dumb but my headphones got iced coffee with creamer spilled on it this morning and wondering if there is anything that would help.
I put them in rice quick before work but was running late. Not sure if the rice hack even works well given its creamy coffee and not just plain water. 
Anyway, most of the coffee got in one of the ear pieces (where it’s brown and stained) now it’s been about 10 hours since the incident and they won’t turn on. I’m not exactly surprised but wondering if anyone has advice. Are they done for? Should I just wait longer and keep them in rice? Has anyone gotten their headphones fixed at a repair store with success? Does the specific location of the spill  give any context in regard to the technology?

I’ve heard some pretty good things about meeting folks through Reddit, so I figured I’d give it a shot! I've been traveling across the country (working remotely) and have been having a blast. It’s definitely had its high and lows, and I've met a bunch of different folks along the way -- but finding those lasting connections is obviously a little tough with this lifestyle. Hence why I'm here on Reddit.

Here's a bit about me:

* I'm 40, male, and work in the medical field.
* I’ve been traveling full-time since last summer. I started on the east coast, made my way through the Ozarks, and now I’m slowly meandering west.
* I love cooking, especially when I can do it outside. My go-to is a cast-iron skillet breakfast hash with whatever’s on hand -- potatoes, eggs, peppers. Hot sauce is a must, let's be real, haha.
* I'm a big reader. Right now it’s a mix of Steinbeck, some travel essays, and a book on neuroscience I like to pretend I understand.
* I used to be a runner, but now I’m more of a ""slow hiker who stops for photos and snacks"" if you get what I mean.
* I grew up near the ocean. I'm not afraid to laugh at myself, like the time I accidentally locked my keys (and shoes) inside the van at a rest stop in the middle of nowhere. Hey, at least it made for a fun story, right?
* I’m pretty low-key. I'm content with campfires, podcasts, stargazing, and the occasional dive bar conversation with strangers.
* I value good communication and people who can sit comfortably in both silence and long talks.
* My playlists jump from indie folk to old soul to 90s hip-hop, depending on the mood.
* I try to practice gratitude, even on WiFi-free days.

What I'm Looking For:

* Someone grounded, kind, and emotionally intelligent.
* someone who’s curious about the world, loves learning, and doesn’t mind taking the scenic route once in a while.
* I’m drawn to folks who can find beauty in simple things like a good cup of good coffee, a quiet morning - stuff like that.
* You don’t have to be a traveler (though that’s always a bonus), just open-minded, thoughtful, and looking to connect

I’m in my 4th year of accounting at the top university in my city. My GPA is pretty average (mostly C’s and B’s in my accounting courses). This past summer I did a 4-month internship at a small public accounting firm. I’m also the president of a student club, and I’d like to think I’m fairly social and not awkward when networking.

I’ve been putting myself out there a lot — I go to tons of networking events and I’ve even met people at firms for coffee chats. Despite that, I just went through application season and unfortunately didn’t get any offers. I only landed one Big 4 interview and one with a mid-sized firm, but nothing came of them.

For context, I’m based in Edmonton, Alberta. What should my next steps be to improve my chances of landing a job in accounting? Should I be focusing on networking even more, grades, extra certifications, or something else entirely?

Any advice from people who’ve been in a similar situation would be greatly appreciated.",1,1759878342.0,Accounting,0,1.0,False

1o0u672,https://www.reddit.com/r/juryduty/comments/1o0u672/jury_duty_in_new_york_state_perspective_of_an/,Jury Duty in New York State - Perspective of an Excused Juror on a Criminal Trial,"I was recently called for trial jury duty in New York State. County juror selection is run by New York State across the state, so I wanted to share what I learned about the process in case it helps others.   

(I’m of course not a lawyer or in the legal field, so lawyers in NYS please chime in to correct any of my statements!)

# General Things to Know:   

1. Be prepared for multiple hours of waiting and sitting quietly, without being able to use your phone.  
2. Breaks may be short, and you will be trapped for some of the time, so bring what you need for the day and don’t assume you'll have time obtain what you might need food or beverage-wise.
3. The defendant(s) will likely be present, and the case outcome has a high chance of being life-altering for them. This can be very heavy to process.
4. In NY, criminal jury selection is very selective, for reasons I’ll get into - don’t be surprised if you don’t get selected, even if you’d be a good juror on the case.

# Day 1 of Jury Duty:

The general overview of Day 1 is:

* Find parking
* Security screening
* Juror check-in (in the juror room)
* Fill out questionnaires
* Juror orientation
* Juror selection (in the courtroom)- this can vary in length

***Reporting/Orientation:***

You've gotten your summons, deferred or not deferred, checked in with the website or the phone line, and been told to report at a certain day and time to security.

Typically the more jurors that will be coming in, the earlier your report time.  It was a busy Monday and we had to report to security by 8:15am. The line was very long at that time, about a 30 minute wait. Security opened at 7:30am.

Belts, metal jewelry or metal buckles on shoes will set off the metal detector, so be aware of that. 

After security, we lined up again outside the central jury room to get checked in.

The juror room was full by the time I arrived. We handed in the questionnaire on our summons and took a seat. 

There was about an hour of down time between checking in and orientation where we weren’t doing much, but we had to stay seated because the orientation may begin any minute.  

In the meanwhile they had us fill out two questionnaires. One is an anonymous demographic question, and another is the one you bring with you to jury selection.  On the second form, you fill in about your residency in the county, profession, and interests, and your experience with law and law enforcement.  When and if you are selected to interview for the jury, each lawyer will have a copy of your answers to review.  

***Jury selection:***

This takes place in the court room. 

After orientation it will be some time between 10-10:30. You’ll have a short break to use the restroom or grab a water or soda at the vending machine. You likely will not be allowed to leave the juror area, however, so if you may need a snack or coffee at this point, bring it for yourself.

You will be assigned a judge or courtroom. I was selected to a case and there were 100 of us.

When you arrive in the courtroom, the judge and court deputies will be there along with the lawyers for both sides. In a criminal case, the prosecution and defense will be there, and most likely the defendant(s) also. If it’s a civil case, the plaintiff’s counsel and the defendant’s counsel will be present. Seeing the defendant can be very impactful, and heightens substantially the sense of gravity.

Next, the jury selection will have a few parts:

* The judge will briefly describe the case (topic/length)
* The judge may excuse those with conflicts 
* Voir dire / jury questioning by the lawyers

***Excusal:***

Out of our group of 100, 45 people asked to be excused and almost all were.

Typical conflicts include vacation plans during the trial dates, caregiving duties, physical/mental impediments, active college student with classes during the dates, obvious inability to serve due to personal experience with the crime or situation. The process for discussing conflicts will vary by courtroom and judge. Sometimes this is done as part of voir dire, but it’s often a separate step, especially for a large group of jurors.

Most people who have a conflict will be excused easily and without a fight from the judge, so if you genuinely feel you can’t serve in the case for any reason, this is the time to speak up. Don’t be shy - The court generally wants people who can be there without distraction. 

***Voir dire / jury interview:***

Voir dire is the questioning of jurors, and their potential elimination by the defense and prosecution. 

This process is a bit of a wild west. At this stage don't be surprised, depending on the context of the trial, if a lot of jurors are excused. You won't really know until the first panel.

The way it works is that 21 prospective jurors are selected at random at a time and brought up to sit in the jury box to be interviewed. However, they may be far from the final group. The lawyers will have a copy of each person's questionnaire. They answer questions about their experiences and beliefs. Next, the lawyers can excuse (eliminate) jurors, either ***for cause*** or using ***peremptory strikes*** (eliminate a juror without a stated cause).

For cause would be if you have a real or potential bias/conflict in the case. It turns out in the trial I was considered for, I was former friends with someone who would testify in the case. I knew I would be more likely to trust their testimony than I would trust anyone else's. Therefore I had to disclose that, and I was eliminated. If your prior experience was sensitive and you feel hesitant to share in front of everyone, you can ask for a private sidebar with the judge and attorneys.

Strikes for cause are unlimited. However, in NYS, what I didn't realize is that each side or party ***also*** has somewhere between 10-20  (!) peremptory strikes of jurors- depending on the seriousness of the crime.  In a group of 50, that means the lawyers between them could potentially strike almost everyone!

After the first panel, only a handful of people stuck out as obviously impartial one way or another. But after counsel discussed with the judge, 18 out of 21 were eliminated! Our group was surprised including some of the people who had been on the panel seemed surprised.

I was a little bit confused and frustrated at first as to why so many people were eliminated who didn't seem to have an obvious bias or conflict.

The judge and counsel will say the process is to weed out those with bias or potential bias, or inability to handle the case.  While that’s true, and very important, there’s also another sort of more hidden layer to voir dire in many criminal cases. The counsel also wants to eliminate anyone who *may* hurt their vote, EVEN if there’s no obvious sign of bias and EVEN if that person could be impartial. This is often based on a gut feeling of how you will behave on the jury.

For example, let's say the prosecution's case did involve controversial or weak elements, including the charge being based on a law that some people might not agree with. The prosecutor in that context is trying to suss out those who are strong leaders and/or independent thinkers who might not buy into their theory of the case, and especially those who might have the instincts to nullify the case. (Jury nullification is voting not guilty because you don't think the law is just, even if the evidence shows clearly the defendant committed crime.)  They are doing this on very little information, and short time, with high stakes.

So if you are eliminated, and don't know why, don't take it to mean that you would have been a biased or unsuitable juror in the case. There can be and very often are other reasons to eliminate a juror, even coming down to gut vibes and past experiences on the part of the defense or prosecution.

As for our final count: At the beginning of voir dire, there were more than 60 of us who could potentially be jurors.  At the end of voir dire, they had interviewed everyone, and there were a half dozen or so people left on the jury!  

Once I understood that it was somewhat subjective, and the lawyers had reign to eliminate any juror who they thought *might* not support their case, it all made much more sense. It seemed like about half the excusals were for cause, and the other half were peremptory strikes.

***A couple jury selection tips:***

* Sitting in the jury box for voir dire can be a nerve-wracking. Give yourself some grace if you feel nervous. I was more nervous than I expected (though also exhausted, to be fair, after a 10-hour day). It’s a very human reaction and the lawyers are probably a little nervous too!  If you feel the nerves would affect your ability to serve, you can disclose that as well and they will typically excuse you.
* If asked about your ability to be impartial - the judge will ask for simple Yes/No answers. They won't want qualifiers like ""Yes, I think"" or ""No, I don't think so"". As a verbal processor, I found this difficult because without speaking, I don't really know what I think. It's also OK to say ""I don't know"" if you can't say ""Yes"" or ""No"". The judge may or may not ask follow-up questions.

If you're not selected, again, it's likely not personal and it doesn't mean you wouldn't have been a capable and impartial juror.

# A few other topics:

***Accessibility:***

One thing that really frustrated me about this process was how inaccessible it was to many prospective jurors.

There are some abilities that can't be accommodated within the current system. However other times, an accommodation would have been easy to provide.

For example, the court deputy walked all of us, including those with physical disabilities, briskly up four flights of stairs without warning even though there was a large bank of elevators nearby. Another example: The elevators closed at 5 pm, even though several of us remained until 6pm. The amount of quiet sitting required. A third: A lawyer who spoke too softly to be heard by most people, let alone those with hearing impairment.  Fourth: No forewarning on the summons about the food options available or timing of meals or times when blood sugars can be checked. Fifth: No captions on the orientation video.

Many accommodations could be possible. For example for those who are neurodivergent or diabetic, you could ask that a court deputy escort you for a stretch break or bathroom break once per hour. For those with a hearing impairment, you could ask that the lawyer be mic'ed on a TTC loop that works with your hearing aids. Captions are simple to add to a digital video.

If would like to participate and think you can do so with accommodations, don't be shy to reach out ahead of time to ask for them. In my opinion NYS should discuss more accommodations more readily with prospective jurors. I think they should include a list of possible barriers to access with the summons, as well as a process for requesting accommodations.  Excluding jurors from their constitutional right to serve when an accommodation is possible, is illegal.

And if you're also displeased with this, take the juror feedback survey after service and ask NYS to improve juror accessibility.

***What to bring:***

Consider:

1. Lunch
2. Protein-rich snacks
3. Water (don't underestimate how long you may be locked in a room)
4. Caffeine
5. Book or a discreet fidget toy  (if really struggle with or dislike sitting quietly)

Keep in mind you may be locked in a room for a while. Lunch could be somewhere between 45 and 90 minutes, and there are few breaks in between for a snack. A cheese stick, apple, or granola bar are good quick snacks to take during brief recesses. Sometimes there will be food options outside the courthouse.

You can't use your device while in court. However if your phone discharges easily and you'll need it once you're excused, bring a power bank as there's not much chance to charge devices. It's possible you'll be sitting in court for a few hours in the morning and afternoon with only a short break.

***What to wear:***

This was something I wondered about. It's totally subjective, and depends on the vibe you want to give off during selection. There were a wide range of dress-codes among jurors in attendance on my report day. It ranged from people wearing jeans and a t-shirt, to a formal business dress or a suit.

I’m sure their dress wasn’t the only factor, but incidentally those retained on the jury panel in my assigned trial had a similar dress-code. I would describe it as relaxed business casual, with mute colors. Think what you would wear to your cousin’s business casual wedding, but in muted colors only such as light gray, very light slate blue, mustard yellow, dark blue, and dress a little less sharp than you might be inclined to. A sweater with khakis and collared shirt beneath. A summer dress with cardigan, a relaxed blazer over slacks, a blouse with slacks, a pullover with khakis. The most formally dressed person wore a light-colored suit without tie, but I'd not recommend going that formal in general.  The main thing about this dress code is that it was dressy, but not casual and not so formal that it might feel like a status challenge to any of the lawyers. (That would be a pretty quick way to get excused, I'd think!)

# Final thoughts

All in all it was eye-opening to see how the process works and to have a change of pace from the day-to-day.

In 2025, there could be better ways to run parts of these processes so that so many people don't have to sit all day, so that those with difficult life situations don't have to report in person, and so that jury selection is less subjective.

No matter what, it will always be purely a numbers game and it takes a lot of jurors to find people that both sides are OK having. A lot of it rides on the instincts and expertise of the prosecution and defense.

Even though most people won’t be selected, you can be proud that you are helping the legal process by presenting to the court as a prospective juror!

The number of peremptory strikes afforded in NYS in criminal trials really surprised me most. Knowing ahead would have helped me to understand what was happening.",7,1759878101.0,juryduty,4,0.89,False

My wife and I primarily drink espresso (we have a delonghi stilosa) or cold brew we make with a French press.  We also want to use this grinder with our mokapot once we finish putting together a Stanley Lunchbox coffee setup for coffee breaks in nature. 

I also want to try making coffee in new methods, but I don’t have any immediate plans. 

Our preferred roast is usually medium to dark roasts with more brown flavors (chocolate, caramel notes, etc.). 

I hear that the K-Ultra is more diverse, but better for light roasts and the J-Ultra is best for espresso and darker roasts.
