I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder about 2 years ago and was seeing a therapist. Due to some life transitions I had to find a new therapist. I had another therapist before this one which I also left when I felt I wasn't making progress. For this therapist I feel a lack of structure and little analysis. I explained these things to her and she said it was not a therapists job to analyze but rather to guide the patient to their own answers. While I agree I found myself just circling around the same points with no solution in sight. Kind of like I am in a dark room with just her vaguely giving me hints to where I can find the light. 

As for the lack of structure she says that my former therapist and I are doing the same thing me and her are doing. The problem is she can let me talk for 15 minutes maybe ask me a question (ex: do you think a is causing b) which can be easily answered with a yes or no. I expressed these concerns with her she offered to do more open ended questions but she didn't really want to do analysis. When I talk with her it feels more like a coffee chat than a therapy session.  I feel she isn't taking my symptoms of numbness/dullness seriously and my anxiety is getting worse (avoiding events/people that may cause anxiety etc etc).

I recently relocated from Louisville to South Philly for my partner’s job. Before I moved, I had an emotional support coffee shop in Louisville — Sunergos — that had the oatmilk lattes of my dreams: rich espresso and perfectly sweet. 

So far, I’ve really enjoyed the espresso at ReAnimator, but I was hoping to find something just slightly more sweet. Anyone have any recommendations? I am a big fan of the classic latte flavors (caramel, vanilla or mocha). 

Thanks in advance! :)

Here are the currently active deals by region:

I’ve been using Coursera Plus for over a year now, and trust me — it’s absolutely worth it, especially with these current discounts where you're saving up to $200.

**To put into perspective:** A single Professional Certificate or Specialization typically costs around **$49/month. But with Coursera Plus at just $199**, you get unlimited access to 10,000+ courses, including top programs from Google, IBM, Meta, Microsoft, and more.

But it’s not just about saving money. Coursera Plus comes with great perks I’ve personally experienced:

**1. Easily Switch Between Programs**

This is one of the best benefits. If you start a program (say, the Google Cybersecurity Certificate) and find it too basic, you can easily switch to another one (like the IBM Cybersecurity Analyst program) without paying extra — something you can't do when buying a single course.

**2. Wide Variety of Courses**

Coursera covers a wide range of subjects — business, computer science, data science, humanities, engineering, and more. This allows you to explore new interests or grow in your current field.

Whether you're aiming to grow your career, pick up in-demand skills, or just explore something new, Coursera Plus is a smart investment.

These deals are live for a few more days, so if it aligns with your goals, claim the deal today.

It’s one of the best chances to level up your learning and earn multiple certificates over the next 12 months.

Happy Learning :)

For the majority of our relationship, things felt genuinely healthy. He was kind, emotionally available, made long-term plans with me, and we had what I thought was mutual respect and transparency.

About two months ago, his behavior started to shift. He began cancelling plans last minute, citing vague work obligations. The connection between us felt off. I tried to give him space, assuming maybe he was overwhelmed — until I started noticing small inconsistencies.

One night, he told me he was working late. Coincidentally, I was passing near his office. The lights were off. His car wasn’t there. That’s when I started to quietly question things.

I didn’t want to invade his privacy, but he had previously linked his iPad to iMessage, and I noticed one day while he was using it that messages from his phone were syncing. I didn’t go looking right away, but I remembered that.

Eventually, I checked. What I found absolutely broke my heart.

He had been regularly messaging and meeting up with his ex-girlfriend. They went out for coffee, drinks, and dinner — several times — and he never told me. Their messages weren’t overly flirtatious, but they were deeply emotional. He said things like:

>

Then I found a message he sent to a friend saying:

>

I felt sick.

I didn’t confront him immediately. I wanted to see if he would come clean, but he didn’t. His birthday was coming up, and I already had everything planned — dinner with his close friends, a gift (a watch he’d been wanting), a whole evening organized.

I went ahead with it all.

At the end of the dinner, I handed him his gift in front of everyone. But instead of the watch, I put a printed copy of the message he sent about “keeping both up.” It was folded neatly in the watch box.

He opened it. He looked confused, then embarrassed. I just said:

>

And I left.

Now, here’s where I’m wondering if I went too far. A few of his friends think I was cruel for doing it publicly. They said I should’ve talked to him in private, that public embarrassment wasn’t necessary. I didn't yell, I didn't insult him, but I did humiliate him in front of people he cared about. Some also say it was shit to do it on his birthday, and it could have waited a day.

Others — including my own friends — say I handled it gracefully and that he deserved to feel the emotional sting after what he did to me.

He’s been texting me constantly, claiming he never “cheated,” just got “emotionally confused.” He says I could have at least spared him the public humiliation and “acted maturely.”

So now I’m wondering…

From the late nights in this city when the world felt too loud, to the quiet moments in between deadlines and breakdowns. We survived midterms and finals together, one coffee and one mental breakdown at a time. Side by side. You were the one person I could count on when everything else felt too heavy — and for that, I’ll always be grateful.

But I also know things shifted. I changed. Maybe we changed. And I’m sorry. For letting my feelings bleed into something that was already enough. For not knowing how to carry what I felt without letting it get in the way. Hindi ko intensyon saktan ka or gawing komplikado ang lahat. But it happened, and I own that.

Still, I hope you know — it wasn’t all just because of me. We both let things go quiet. We both stood in the middle of something we didn’t know how to handle. And by the time we realized what was happening, we were already on opposite sides.

This letter isn’t to take it all back. I’m not writing this to be in your life again. This is just me being honest. Saying sorry, and thank you. Thank you for being there in a time I’ll never forget. For being my safe space when I didn’t know I needed one. For making even the worst days feel a little softer just because you were there.

You were such a big part of my life. And even now, in the quiet of goodbye, you still are.

We’re going different ways now. Maybe we were always meant to. But I’ll carry this friendship and everything it gave me for the rest of my life.

I hope you’re okay. I hope you’re healing. I hope life is kind to you. I won’t reach out again, but I’ll always, quietly, be rooting for you.

Cortisol Dysregulation and Akathisia

Research on the link between cortisol (the body’s primary stress hormone) and akathisia is limited but suggestive. An early study of haloperidol (antipsychotic) challenge in healthy volunteers found that those who developed acute akathisia had lower cortisol levels than those who did not ￼. In fact, at 90 minutes after haloperidol, the akathisia group’s cortisol was significantly below that of controls ￼. This hints that an blunted cortisol response (or generally low cortisol activity) might predispose individuals to akathisia, possibly by failing to counteract stress-related neurochemical imbalances. Conversely, there are case observations implicating excess cortisol: for example, a patient with Cushing’s syndrome (chronically high cortisol) developed severe, early-onset akathisia and tardive dyskinesia when placed on antipsychotics ￼. The authors speculated that hypercortisolemia (excess cortisol) in Cushing’s might heighten susceptibility to these side effects.

Biologically, cortisol interacts with many systems – it modulates metabolism, stress responses, and even neurotransmitters like dopamine and noradrenaline. High cortisol (as in chronic stress or Cushing’s) is often associated with anxiety, insomnia and heightened arousal, which could plausibly worsen restlessness or trigger akathisia-like agitation. On the other hand, low cortisol (as in adrenal insufficiency or a blunted stress response) might lead to unopposed adrenaline surges and autonomic instability, also potentially provoking inner restlessness. Some anecdotal reports support this: On patient forums, individuals have noted spikes of intense “morning cortisol surges” that coincide with their worst akathisia symptoms, describing an internal jolt of adrenaline upon waking ￼. Intriguingly, one patient who monitored their adrenal function after antidepressant withdrawal reported that despite feeling a cortisol rush, their actual lab tests showed very low cortisol, suggesting a dysregulated or “rebound” cortisol awakening response ￼. This indicates the HPA-axis (hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis) may be out-of-sync in some cases of withdrawal-related akathisia – for instance, the body might overshoot adrenaline output when cortisol is deficient, leading to extreme jitteriness. Indeed, forum users sometimes debate whether their symptoms are “cortisol spikes or akathisia,” and some have experimented with stress-hormone blockers like propranolol (a beta-blocker) to calm the sensations ￼. While individual experiences vary, stress and cortisol dysregulation are consistently cited as aggravating factors. Notably, patients coping with chronic akathisia often emphasize stress avoidance; one sufferer described that she had to live “quietly, lovingly and gently” and avoid stress to keep symptoms manageable ￼. In summary, although direct evidence is sparse, it is biologically plausible that cortisol imbalances – either unusually low or high – might exacerbate akathisia by altering stress reactivity and neurotransmitter balance. The relationship appears complex (and possibly bidirectional), as akathisia itself is profoundly stressful and could further disturb cortisol rhythms.

Idiopathic and Lesser-Known Causes of Akathisia

Beyond the well-known culprits (antipsychotics, SSRIs, other dopamine blockers), a variety of under-recognized medical factors have been linked to akathisia or akathisia-mimicking symptoms:
	•	Iron Deficiency: Low iron levels are a notable example. Iron is a cofactor for dopamine synthesis, and deficiency in the brain can manifest as restlessness. Multiple studies have found akathisia patients tend to have lower serum iron compared to non-akathisic patients ￼. A meta-analysis confirmed significantly reduced iron stores in those with antipsychotic-induced akathisia ￼. There are even case reports of refractory neuroleptic akathisia improving after intravenous iron supplementation ￼. Clinicians now recognize iron-deficiency anemia (and even latent iron deficiency without anemia) as a risk factor for akathisia-like motor unrest. This is analogous to Restless Legs Syndrome, which is often worsened by low iron – a parallel that further supports the iron-akathisia connection.
	•	Thyroid Dysfunction: Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) can produce symptoms that resemble akathisia: patients often experience pronounced restlessness, nervous energy, and an inability to stay still ￼. These symptoms stem from a generalized metabolic overdrive caused by excess thyroid hormones. While hyperthyroid-induced agitation isn’t true akathisia (since it is not medication-induced and lacks the subjective “inner torment” component), it can be misinterpreted as such. Notably, once hyperthyroidism is treated, these akathisia-like symptoms usually abate. (In contrast, hypothyroidism is more associated with fatigue and psychomotor slowing, so it’s not typically linked to akathisia – though severe hypothyroidism can cause paradoxical agitation in rare cases.)
	•	Metabolic and Systemic Illnesses: Certain organ dysfunctions have been reported to trigger akathisia or restless agitation. For example, renal impairment (uremia) and liver failure can lead to a buildup of toxins and alter neurotransmitter levels, sometimes resulting in motor restlessness. In one discussion, an osteopath noted a patient with “akathisia-like” symptoms that resolved after dialysis, suggesting uremic toxins were a culprit ￼. Similarly, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (especially if it causes peripheral neuropathy or metabolic swings) has been listed as a condition that “commonly causes akathisia” in reviews, alongside renal failure and anemia ￼. It’s possible that neuropathic discomfort or blood sugar fluctuations in diabetics create constant internal unrest. Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) in particular triggers an adrenaline release that can feel indistinguishable from akathisia – some have speculated that dysregulated glucose may contribute to withdrawal akathisia symptoms ￼. While more research is needed, clinicians are advised to check for and correct metabolic derangements (electrolyte imbalances, hypoglycemia, etc.) in patients with unexplained restlessness.
	•	Neurological Disorders: Parkinson’s disease and related disorders can present with restlessness, and Parkinsonian tremors or akinetic agitation may be mistaken for akathisia. In fact, Parkinson’s disease itself has been “linked to akathisia” in the sense that patients may have an inner restlessness (especially if under-medicated) ￼. More commonly, however, Parkinsonian akathisia occurs due to treatment: withdrawal of dopaminergic drugs (like stopping levodopa or dopamine agonists too abruptly) can precipitate acute akathisia ￼. This is essentially a withdrawal akathisia from Parkinson’s meds, analogous to what happens with antipsychotic withdrawal. Another neurological condition, ADHD, involves chronic fidgetiness and inability to stay still; some have wondered if having ADHD predisposes one to akathisia. (So far, there’s no clear evidence of a predisposition – as one expert quipped, “I think anyone can get akathisia and it is very much a bodily thing” ￼ – but it’s an interesting area for future study.)
	•	Hormonal Fluctuations: There are hints that hormone swings can modulate akathisia. Women with severe premenstrual tension (PMDD) sometimes report extreme agitation or “inner crawling” sensations that have been likened to akathisia. Notably, one small study found the diuretic/carbonic-anhydrase-inhibitor acetazolamide relieved PMDD mood symptoms effectively ￼, and the author proposed that fluid retention and neuroexcitation in PMDD might share mechanisms with akathisia (“an akathisic element” to the irritability) ￼. Likewise, some cases of postpartum or perimenopausal onset akathisia are reported anecdotally – possibly related to the huge hormonal shifts plus stress. Cortisol again plays a role here: high estrogen states can increase cortisol-binding globulin, potentially altering free cortisol levels, while progesterone and cortisol have interactions that affect GABA and dopamine. Although this remains speculative, under-recognized endocrine factors (thyroid, adrenal, gonadal hormones) may influence susceptibility to akathisia in certain individuals.
	•	Withdrawal from Sedatives: It is increasingly recognized that withdrawal from various substances can produce akathisia-like symptoms. Benzodiazepine withdrawal, for example, often causes intense anxiety, autonomic arousal and motor restlessness that patients describe as “hellish akathisia.” Similarly, alcohol withdrawal can lead to extreme agitation and pacing. These states are not classic medication-induced akathisia (since they aren’t caused by dopamine blockade), but they can look very similar. Clinically, a careful history of substance use is important: abrupt discontinuation of benzos, opioids, or alcohol may be the hidden cause of a patient’s restlessness ￼. In these cases, addressing the withdrawal (and avoiding sudden cessation in the first place) is key to relief.
	•	“Hypotensive Akathisia”: A rare entity described in neurology is orthostatic or hypotensive akathisia, where failure of the autonomic nervous system (and resulting low blood pressure upon standing) leads to intolerable restlessness when upright ￼. Unlike typical akathisia, this phenomenon occurs only while sitting or standing (and is relieved when lying down) ￼. It has been observed in conditions like multiple system atrophy or severe autonomic neuropathy. This highlights that not all akathisia is due to psychotropic drugs – some can arise from cardiovascular/autonomic dysfunction. Patients with this condition literally cannot sit still without moving their legs, due to inadequate blood pressure and reflex sympathetic activation. Treating the blood pressure issue (midodrine, fludrocortisone, etc.) can alleviate the restlessness.

In summary, akathisia can have surprisingly diverse triggers. Besides antipsychotics and SSRIs, clinicians and patients have noted contributions from iron/vitamin deficiencies, thyroid overactivity, metabolic disorders (diabetes, uremia), neurological disease, hormone swings, and withdrawal states. Many of these factors tie back to dopamine or nervous system hyperactivity in some way – for instance, iron deficiency impairs dopamine synthesis ￼, hyperthyroidism and withdrawal syndromes both ramp up adrenergic output, and so on. It’s important to investigate these possibilities in “idiopathic” akathisia (cases with no obvious drug cause). Treating an underlying condition – be it repleting iron, stabilizing thyroid levels, or managing blood sugar – may considerably improve the akathisia symptoms if that was an aggravating factor.

Emerging Theories and Patient Experiences

Because akathisia is so torturous and poorly understood, patients and researchers alike have begun to explore non-traditional explanations and remedies. A few notable trends have emerged from patient forums and recent discussions:
	•	HPA Axis “Rebound” and Morning Surges: As mentioned, many individuals in antidepressant or antipsychotic withdrawal report a severe morning exacerbation of akathisia symptoms. On the SurvivingAntidepressants forum (a peer support community), the prevailing theory is that the normal cortisol awakening response (which gives us a boost of cortisol before dawn) becomes exaggerated or dysregulated during withdrawal ￼. People wake up in a panic with heart-pounding restlessness. Interestingly, some have had their cortisol levels tested and found them paradoxically low despite the intense symptoms ￼. This has led to speculation that the problem may be receptor hypersensitivity or adrenaline overproduction – essentially, if cortisol is insufficient or “out of phase,” the body might dump adrenaline to compensate, causing an akathisia-like rush. Others speculate that unstable blood sugar overnight (common in stressed, sleep-deprived individuals) triggers an adrenaline spike at 4–5 AM, again resulting in morning akathisia feelings. Many coping strategies shared online target this pattern: for example, ensure a bedtime snack to prevent hypoglycemia, practice sleep hygiene to blunt the cortisol spike, or take beta blockers early in the morning to dampen the adrenergic response.
	•	“Feels Like Adrenaline”: A recurring description in patient narratives is that akathisia feels like an adrenaline storm. “My akathisia consists of adrenaline rushes,” one sufferer wrote, “I feel jittery like I’ve had 10 cups of coffee”. This perspective aligns with the physical symptoms (racing heart, tremor, panic) and ties back to cortisol as well (since cortisol and adrenaline are both released during stress). Some patients say these sensations gradually calmed down over time as their nervous system healed ￼. The adrenaline-like quality of akathisia has inspired trials of treatments targeting the sympathetic nervous system. For instance, propranolol (a non-selective beta adrenergic blocker) is a first-line medication for akathisia that can blunt the peripheral signs of adrenaline excess (rapid heart rate, hypertension) and often subjectively reduces inner restlessness. Similarly, clonidine (an alpha-2 agonist) can reduce central sympathetic outflow. Both essentially act as anti-adrenaline drugs, supporting the notion that an overstimulated fight-or-flight response is involved in akathisia’s expression ￼. Patients also report lifestyle adjustments like eliminating caffeine, avoiding scary or intense stimuli, and using relaxation techniques – all aimed at keeping adrenaline at bay.
	•	Inflammation and Acid–Base Balance: An intriguing emerging theory is that akathisia may be worsened by systemic inflammation or an alkaline shift in the body’s pH. Psychopharmacologist David Healy recently noted a “thread” among various remedies that seem to help akathisia: they tend to make the body slightly more acidic ￼. He points out that inhaling a bit of CO₂ (which acidifies blood) was an old-fashioned treatment for panic, and suggests it might be worth testing for akathisia ￼. Likewise, some patients found adding vinegar (an acid) to their diet calming, whereas taking antacids or sodium bicarbonate sometimes worsened their akathisia ￼. The mechanism here is speculative – it could relate to ion channels or the way pH affects neurotransmitters – but it’s a novel avenue. On a related note, chronic inflammation (which can alter brain tryptophan and dopamine metabolism) has been proposed as a contributor to treatment-resistant akathisia. Anti-inflammatory supplements like omega-3, magnesium, or N-acetylcysteine are occasionally discussed in forums, though clear evidence is lacking. This is an area where more research is needed, but it underscores that akathisia might have a physiological component beyond pure dopamine blockade, potentially involving metabolic and inflammatory pathways.
	•	Gut-Brain Connection: In some desperate cases, patients have experimented with treating their gut flora and infections to alleviate akathisia. There is a fascinating anecdote of one individual who suspected that small-intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and general gut dysbiosis were fueling his chronic akathisia. He took a course of amoxicillin (an antibiotic) combined with lactoferrin (an iron-binding protein that can reduce bacterial growth by sequestering iron). To his astonishment, his akathisia symptoms improved by about 90% during that regimen ￼. He later realized lactoferrin’s iron-chelating effect likely enhanced the antibiotic’s power (since bacteria need iron to thrive), indirectly supporting a gut microbiome role ￼. This is just one case, but it aligns with growing interest in the microbiome’s influence on brain health. Some gut bacteria can produce or consume neurotransmitters; chronic infection or dysbiosis can trigger systemic inflammation, which in turn affects the brain. It’s plausible that in certain individuals, addressing gastrointestinal issues alleviates the inner restlessness. Along these lines, forum users have shared tips like following anti-inflammatory diets, treating yeast overgrowth, or using probiotics – essentially holistic approaches to calm the body, which in some reports have lessened akathisia severity. While these anecdotes are not yet backed by clinical trials, they open avenues for further investigation (for example, could a subset of “idiopathic” akathisia actually be driven by an occult infection or autoimmune process?).
	•	Miscellaneous Anecdotes: The online akathisia community has surfaced many other creative hypotheses. Some patterns noted include: weather or environmental triggers (a few people report heat intolerance or cold exposure flaring symptoms, possibly via cortisol or thyroid effects), allergic reactions (histamine can cause akathisia-like akathisic agitation in some cases; interestingly, a case report exists of akathisia from an antibiotic allergy, and some patients with mast cell disorders describe restlessness), and even sensory overload (bright lights, noise, or busy environments can subjectively worsen the inner agitation – this might be more about the person’s anxiety than a direct cause, but it’s frequently mentioned that akathisia patients need a calm, low-stimulation setting). Another anecdotal “remedy” making the rounds is high-dose vitamin B1 (thiamine). A few individuals with long-term, idiopathic akathisia tried large doses of thiamine and reported improved energy metabolism and reduced lactic acid build-up in muscles, correlating with less restlessness. Though purely experimental, it ties into the idea that mitochondrial dysfunction or subtle vitamin deficiencies could exacerbate akathisia in some cases.

Overall, patient discussions underscore that akathisia is not a one-dimensional condition. It involves a tangle of neurological, endocrine, and even immunological factors. Cortisol dysregulation stands out as a recurring theme – whether it’s the stress of withdrawal causing cortisol havoc, or cortisol’s absence leading to adrenaline overdrive, many believe balancing the stress response is key to relief. Likewise, addressing “the basics” (iron levels, thyroid function, sleep quality, nutrition, gut health) has become an emerging holistic strategy in tough akathisia cases. These approaches are born from patient experiences and small observations, so they need formal study. But they offer hope that beyond the standard treatments (beta-blockers, mirtazapine, benzodiazepines ￼ ￼), there may be deeper biological levers we can pull to ease akathisia’s torment.

Conclusion – The Cortisol Connection and Beyond

In summary, there is evidence to support a plausible connection between cortisol dysregulation and akathisia. High cortisol (as seen in Cushing’s or extreme stress) may heighten vulnerability to akathisia or intensify its symptoms, whereas low cortisol (as in adrenal insufficiency or blunted stress responses) might remove a buffer against adrenaline, also precipitating restless agitation. The biological basis for this likely lies in cortisol’s ability to maintain homeostasis under stress – too much or too little cortisol can upset the balance of neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine) that govern motor activity and anxiety. While not the primary cause of akathisia, cortisol imbalances could be a significant modifier of the condition’s severity and duration. Importantly, addressing cortisol issues – e.g. through stress management, proper tapering of medications to avoid withdrawal shock, and in some cases medical treatment of endocrine disorders – might improve outcomes for akathisia sufferers, although formal research is needed.

Beyond medications, we have explored a range of under-recognized factors that can contribute to akathisia. Conditions like iron deficiency, hyperthyroidism, metabolic derangements, and others are sometimes overlooked in patients who develop “spontaneous” akathisia without a clear drug trigger. The peer-reviewed literature and case reports do suggest these associations (for example, iron status and akathisia are clearly linked ￼, and hyperthyroid restlessness can mimic akathisia ￼). Moreover, patient communities have identified patterns – such as morning cortisol spikes, dietary influences, and the role of inflammation – that point toward akathisia being a whole-body problem, not merely a side effect isolated to the brain’s dopamine receptors. These insights from sufferers are valuable clues for clinicians and researchers. They remind us that akathisia’s “idiopathic” cases might not be so idiopathic after all, if one digs a bit deeper into the person’s endocrine, nutritional, and neurological health.

In practice, a comprehensive approach to akathisia should consider these lesser-known contributors. For a patient with persistent akathisia, it may be worth checking iron and B12 levels, thyroid function, and cortisol patterns (perhaps even a diurnal cortisol curve). Identifying an out-of-range result provides an opportunity to treat that aspect and potentially ease the restlessness. At the very least, optimizing the patient’s overall health – ensuring good sleep (to normalize cortisol) ￼, reducing external stress, avoiding stimulants, and correcting any deficiencies – can bolster their resilience against akathisia. Indeed, many survivors of long-term akathisia emphasize lifestyle adjustments as crucial: gentle exercise, meditation, anti-inflammatory diets, and time are often cited as helping them gradually recover. As one patient encouraged others, “time helps – keep courage” ￼.

In conclusion, the connection between cortisol and akathisia is an evolving area of interest. While not fully proven, it is supported by biological reasoning and some data that cortisol is involved in the stress-restlessness loop. Additionally, a host of other under-recognized causes – from hormones to micronutrients to withdrawal states – can trigger or worsen akathisia. Being aware of these can lead to more personalized and effective management. Akathisia is a complex, multifactorial phenomenon; appreciating this complexity can validate patients’ experiences (many of which have been dismissed in the past) and open new avenues for relief. Ongoing research and patient advocacy are shedding light on these connections, offering hope that what has long been considered a purely “drug-induced” disorder may soon be understood in a broader biopsychosocial context, with more tools available to fight it.

Back here for Round 2.

I’d posted a while back looking for accountability partners, and while it sparked some initial connections, it kinda fizzled out. So I’m putting the call out again—with clearer intent and renewed energy.

I’m a 39M from Bangalore on a mission to turn things around—body, mind, and lifestyle. I know the drill: keto/low-carb eating, regular movement, good sleep.

So, I’m looking to connect with a **small, committed crew**—who are genuinely serious about health and life goals, but also up for sharing the ups and downs that come with it. Not a massive group—just a handful of folks who want to check in, support each other, and maybe build something real along the way.

A bit about me: I’m an introvert (not shy, just slow to warm up). But once we vibe, I’m fully engaged, talk a mile a minute, and love cheering people on. I’m in **Bangalore**, and while I’m happy to connect with anyone online, if you’re local, we could meet up now and then for walks, workouts, or even coffee check-ins ☕.

If you're trying to:

* Eat better 🍳
* Move more 🏋️‍♂️
* Sleep smarter 😴
* And finally stay consistent ✅

Then DM or drop a comment.  
**Bonus: I’ve still got that bucket list waiting—and I’d love to go through it with my tribe** 💥

1lm0l4a,https://i.redd.it/m7cku0zsdi9f1.jpeg,Step 1 Exam Day – What Happens at the Test Center & How To Handled It,"My study partner asked me what to expect on the day of the Step 1 exam — how the test center works, what to bring, how breaks go, etc. Here's exactly what I did, in the order I did it:

I walked to the exam center **two days before my exam** to make sure I knew the way and how to get in. I checked out the place — the bathroom, the lockers. Nothing was unusual; I think it’s pretty standard wherever you go.

My exam was scheduled for **9:00 AM**, and the guy there told me to get there by **8:30 AM at the latest**, preferably **by 8:00**.

The **day before my exam**, I shopped and packed everything I needed for test day. I planned for **five breaks**, each scheduled to be **5 minutes**, with a specific purpose:

* Use the bathroom (regardless of what’s in your tank)
* Sip some water
* Eat your designated snack for that break
* Stretch/Squat/Tai-Chi/Whatever makes you feel POWERFUL
* Walk back in there like a **f**\*ing boss\*\*

**On exam day**, I woke up at **6:30 AM**, stretched, showered, had a small bowl of oatmeal, a banana, and half a cup of coffee. I left my place at **7:30** and got to the center at exactly **8:00**.

I was the first one there. After I settled everything in the locker, used the bathroom, and stretched, they checked me in around **8:25**, so I could start early.

I **skipped the tutorial** and jumped into Block 1.

After Block 1, I stretched my shoulders in my seat, shook my head out, and started Block 2 about **2 minutes later**.

After Block 2, I took **Break #1** — it took slightly more than 5 minutes to do everything, but that’s okay. That’s *why* you schedule for 5 minutes — even if it runs over a little, you’re fine.

Then I did:

* **Block 3 → Break #2** (same thing)
* **Block 4 → Break #3**

For **Breaks 1–3**, I had:

* 5 berries
* ⅓ of a protein bar
* 1 square of dark chocolate

Then:

* **Block 5 → Break #4** I had half a cold sandwich and a sip of an energy drink.
* **Block 6 → Break #5** I ate the other half of the sandwich and had more energy drink — then went back in to finish strong.

**Every time I re-entered the testing room**, I had to:

* Empty my pockets
* Show my glasses
* Get quickly patted down
* Get scanned with a metal detector

That whole process takes less than a minute. So yes, count it into your time — but don’t freak out about it.

This break strategy gave me **ample time** to do everything I needed and still left **wiggle room** for emergency bathroom trips or quick chats with people.

Stay calm. Stay locked in.  
You’ll be surprised how **fun** it feels to walk in and perform like a **freaking machine**.",2,1751047189.0,step1,1,0.75,False

Hello! Myself 27/F and boyfriend 26/M are finally ready to move in together, as my lease in New York is up soon and I will move back home.  We have been together for a year.

We are looking to get a place and decided against saving up at my parents. We are looking at 2 places and I need help as there are pros and cons. They are about the same price at $2,000.

1.	⁠part of a house split with someone (like condo style). Very cute, a bit outdated appliances but still nice. No dishwasher, great natural light. AND coming from NY I love a place that’s walkable. We’d be in the suburbs but it’s right in a busy town on a walkable strip, walkable to the park, coffee store, farmers market, etc. It’s a one bedroom.


2.	⁠in an apartment complex (don’t love, kinda feel like they give twilight zone vibes sometimes, but I’m probably just being picky). It’s farther from the strip & park (40 min ish walk but 8 min drive & we have cars). Newer appliances, AND a two bedroom. I work from home and just think another bedroom would be nice. Also sometimes my bf snores and it has been a bit of a strain on our relationship. Having the option to leave the room and sleep in a separate room if I needed to instead of getting no sleep might be a huge plus to our relationship. Also I’m starting school again soon with working part time so would need it.

Im thinking if I pick the one bedroom I would regret not having 2 bedrooms and my own space (we were thinking about getting a dog too or fostering, which the apartment complex might be better for since there’s some walking paths with greenery). But then I’m also scared coming from the city with energy everywhere and so much to do and walk to, I’d go go stir crazy / feel isolated in a complex in its own section instead of being in the middle of the energy and popping town! I love the town sm with coffee stores, yoga places, just very lively.

In the fifth year of their marriage, Julian Mitchell cheated.  
  
He secretly kept a mistress behind Serena Caldwell's back. When Serena found out, she didn't make a scene. Instead, the very next day, she arranged for the mistress to willingly leave with a wealthy businessman from Seattle.  
  
After that day, Julian tacitly returned to family life, resuming his role as the tender, attentive husband.  
  
Serena thought it was just a small hiccup in their marriage.  
  
But a year later, everything fell apart—  
  
Her family's company declared bankruptcy. Her father jumped to his death, crushed under massive debt. Her mother was brutally assaulted by creditors until she died. Her brother was left in a vegetative state after being hit by a car.  
  
And Serena, unable to bear these consecutive blows, fell critically ill.  
  
In her final moments, Julian's face contorted with rage: ""When you sent Melody to that old man, causing her to be tortured to death in bed without an inch of unbruised skin, you should have known this day would come. Serena, this is your karma!""  
  
So that's how it was...  
  
This had all been Julian's revenge.  
  
Serena lay in bed, her face deathly pale, staring blankly at the man she had loved with her life, before finally dying with hatred in her heart.  
  
When she opened her eyes again, she was standing at the study door.  
  
Her heart pounded with lingering shock and grief, but before she could process everything, she heard a conversation from inside.  
  
Julian was on the phone.  
  
""Thanks, man. Just transfer that suburban villa to Melody's name for now. I owe you one. And remember, don't let my wife find out.""  
  
This familiar conversation jolted Serena into awareness.  
  
She had been reborn!  
  
Yes, this was exactly the moment when she had accidentally discovered Julian was keeping a mistress.  
  
As she collected herself, she heard him continue: ""Melody is special. When I'm with her, I feel relaxed and passionate. Not like with Serena—she only makes me feel suffocated, boring and dull. I'm just taking a breather. When I get tired of playing around, it won't affect my love for my wife.""  
  
Hearing it again, her heart still sank painfully.  
  
Serena clenched her fingers, remembering his cruel words before her death in her previous life. Despite herself, her eyes reddened.  
  
Pushing those thoughts aside, she returned to the sofa.  
  
When Julian came out and saw her, he froze.  
  
""Babe, when did you get back?"" he asked.  
  
""Just now,"" Serena replied calmly.  
  
Julian's smile faltered into nervousness when he realized his wife, who should have been out shopping, had returned early. ""There's an issue with a project. I need to head back to the office,"" he said.  
  
It was the same excuse as in her previous life.  
  
Serena stared at him for a beat: ""Okay, go ahead.""  
  
In this life, she was tired. She didn't want to cling anymore.  
  
As expected, Julian didn't come home that night.  
  
Meanwhile, Serena sat motionless until dawn. When the first rays of sunlight streamed through the window, she rubbed her tired, burning eyes, then got up, forced down some breakfast, and headed out the door.  
  
She visited a law firm first, then headed to Mitchell Enterprises.  
  
Julian's office was on the top floor. When Serena stepped out of the elevator, the reception area was empty, but moans could be heard from inside his office.  
  
""Mmm... Mr. Mitchell, Melody can't take it anymore\~""  
  
""Mr. Mitchell?!"" Julian snapped, immediately displeased. He gripped her waist and thrust harder, causing the woman beneath him to moan louder.  
  
Then, in a half-coaxing, half-commanding tone, he asked: ""Melody's being naughty. What should you call me?""  
  
The woman clutched his hand, feeling as if she were floating on clouds.  
  
""B-baby, Melody won't dare again, I promise\~""  
  
""Good girl!""  
  
Serena's nails dug painfully into her palms. Though she had already discovered the truth, her heart still shattered in that moment.  
  
After a long pause, she finally knocked on the door.  
  
When she entered, Julian was sitting at his desk, looking thoroughly satisfied. ""What brings you here?"" he asked.  
  
""I need you to sign some papers,"" Serena replied, pulling divorce papers from her bag.  
  
She then flipped to the signature page and handed it across the desk.  
  
""What documents?"" Julian asked, taking the papers.  
  
He was about to glance at it when a soft moan came from under the desk. His body shuddered as he leaned back, then quickly recovered, clearing his throat a few times to cover up the sound.  
  
Serena pretended not to hear, her nails digging crescents into her bag as she swallowed the bitter lump in her throat. ""Nothing special, just property transfer papers.""  
  
Hearing this, Julian's suspicion faded.  
  
He eagerly grabbed a pen from the desk and signed his name with a flourish. ""You could have had someone deliver these. Don't tire yourself out.""  
  
Was he worried about her getting tired, or worried about her discovering his secret?  
  
Serena's lips curled into a sneer. ""It's fine, just this once. You can get back to work now.""  
  
Once outside, she immediately made a phone call: ""I can sell you twenty percent of Mitchell Enterprises at a discount.""  
  
""Good. When do we sign?""  
  
""In a month.""  
  
By then, their divorce would be final, and she would be rid of the company she had helped build with her blood, sweat, and tears.  
  
Julian, in my past life you accused me of getting rid of your mistress.  
  
So this time, I'll do exactly as you wish.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Before leaving, Serena went to the restroom.  
  
When she came out, she ran into Melody Leverett coming toward her. The woman had an hourglass figure but an innocent face—exactly the type men found irresistible.  
  
""Mrs. Mitchell, you're still here?"" Melody made no attempt to hide anything.  
  
She deliberately exposed her cleavage, where love marks served as both flaunting and provocation.  
  
Serena stopped, examining her.  
  
In her previous life, she had used swift, harsh methods to make Melody back down in less than a day, brokering a deal that had the woman voluntarily resign as secretary and leave for Seattle.  
  
But now, she couldn't be bothered to play games.  
  
She ignored Melody and walked toward the elevator, but after a few steps, coffee was splashed on her back.  
  
""Oops\~!"" Melody exclaimed with false concern, waving her cup. ""So sorry, I'm still shaky from... helping Mr. Mitchell relieve some tension. My hand's still trembling.""  
  
Hearing those words, Serena pictured their entangled bodies and felt nauseated.  
  
She had no desire to participate in their relationship drama, but she wouldn't let herself be humiliated.  
  
So she stepped forward quickly and slapped Melody across the face.  
  
Just then, Julian walked out of his office.  
  
Melody seized the opportunity, falling in front of Serena and kneeling as she clutched her face. ""I'm so sorry, Mrs. Mitchell! It was an accident, please don't be angry with me.""  
  
Julian rushed over and pushed Serena aside. Her already burned back hit the corner of the wall, making her gasp in pain.  
  
But Julian didn't notice. Instead, he crouched beside Melody and asked: ""What happened?""  
  
Melody pouted fearfully and said, ""I was feeling lightheaded from low blood sugar and accidentally spilled coffee on Mrs. Mitchell's back. She slapped me, which I deserved, but I feel so dizzy now.""  
  
Hearing this, Julian glared at Serena.  
  
His eyes blazed with barely contained fury as he said: ""She's just an intern! Everyone makes mistakes when they're new. Did you really need to make such a big deal out of it?""  
  
With that, he immediately carried Melody into his office.  
  
Watching his anxious retreating back, Serena's pent-up frustration spilled over in two lines of tears.  
  
She remembered how once, when she had just cut her finger, Julian had panicked and rushed her to the emergency room, much to the doctor's amusement. Yet now he was showing that same concern for someone else.  
  
Despite her resolve to let go, her heart still ached terribly.  
  
She forced herself to stand straight, left the company, and went directly to the court to file for divorce. Once the cooling-off period ended, her marriage to Julian would be over for good.  
  
Back home, Julian was nowhere to be found.  
  
He had only sent a message saying he was working late at the office and reminding her not to be late for tomorrow's client dinner.  
  
It was a business dinner they had previously agreed to attend.  
  
Serena simply replied ""okay.""  
  
She didn't mention the hurt she'd suffered that day, nor did she expose his ""working late"" lie.  
  
Because none of it mattered anymore.  
  
The next day at the venue, she didn't see Julian. Instead, she found Melody waiting.  
  
""Mr. Mitchell is still in a meeting. He asked me to let you know and said I should join you to learn,"" Melody explained, suddenly all business-like.  
  
Serena could only lead her into the private room.  
  
During the dinner, Melody kept enthusiastically toasting the client, practically draping herself over him. The implication was clear to anyone watching.  
  
Serena had always despised such tactics, so she excused herself to use the restroom.  
  
When she returned, the private room was surrounded by people. She pushed through the crowd and entered to find chaos.  
  
Julian had arrived.  
  
But the client was lying in a pool of blood...  
  
Chapter 3  
  
""What's going on here?!""  
  
Serena asked in bewilderment.  
  
But when she saw Melody's disheveled clothes as she trembled in Julian's arms, she understood.  
  
He had flown into a rage to protect his mistress. Then, unexpectedly, she too received a slap across her face.  
  
""What's going on? Like you don't know?!"" Julian's eyes were bloodshot with fury as he glared at her like an enraged lion. ""Serena, if you want to play the sleeping-your-way-to-the-top game, I won't stop you, but leave Melody out of it. She's innocent, unlike you who'll do anything to get ahead.""  
  
Serena stood frozen in shock.  
  
Her cheek stung, but his words hurt far worse.  
  
She would do anything to get ahead?!  
  
During the company's early years when they often had to chase business deals, she had once faced a similar situation. Rather than compromise, she had fought her way out, offending the client.  
  
Back then, Julian had stormed in, beating the man severely and getting detained for days. But he had comforted her: ""You did great. Thank you for protecting yourself, my darling.""  
  
Later, everyone knew how much she despised using sex for business.  
  
Yet now, in Julian's eyes, she had become a woman who would do anything for a deal.  
  
A tear slipped from Serena's eye. ""Is that really who you think I am?""  
  
Julian faltered, his resolve wavering.  
  
Just then, Melody clutched his shirt, her face flushed as she said: ""Mr. Mitchell, Mrs. Mitchell told me to keep toasting Mr. Zemo. I said I couldn't handle alcohol, but he kept forcing drinks on me. I feel terrible now.""  
  
His expression hardened again, his gaze at Serena turning venomous: ""People change. I don't even recognize you anymore.""  
  
With that, he picked Melody up and left.  
  
Serena lowered her eyes, silent for a long while before forcing a smile that looked more pained than tears.  
  
Yes, people do change.  
  
He was no longer her Julian.  
  
On her way home, she was dragged into a dark alley.  
  
""What are you doing?!"" Serena's face paled with fear.  
  
But they ignored her completely, pinning her firmly to the ground and answering her question with brutal action instead of words.  
  
Ninety-nine bottles of hard liquor were stacked on the ground.  
  
One by one, the men opened them and forced the burning liquid down her throat. Serena tried to scream for help, but could only choke and gasp.  
  
The alcohol scorched her throat, burning and painful.  
  
Serena struggled desperately, but like a lamb on a butcher's block, she couldn't move. All she could do was cry silently.  
  
After emptying the bottles, the men tore at her delicate clothing, exposing her snow-white skin and causing them to leer with lustful eyes.  
  
""Wait!"" one of them suddenly spoke up. ""We were only told to teach her a lesson. Don't take this too far—we can't afford to cross that line.""  
  
But another sneered: ""What are you afraid of? Have you ever seen a man be this vicious to his own wife? Even if we sleep with her, he'd probably thank us.""  
  
Her eyes flew open in shock, like a thunderbolt had struck her.  
  
Were they talking about Julian?  
  
Just because Melody had pretended to be force-fed alcohol and nearly taken advantage of, he was furious enough to want her to experience the same...  
  
He truly loved Melody to such an extreme.  
  
Just as one of the men was about to touch her skin with his filthy hands, police sirens wailed outside. Then a woman shouted: ""Stop! I've called the police!""  
  
The men scattered in panic.  
  
Serena escaped danger, but stared blankly at the night sky, seeming soul-less.  
  
Suddenly, she broke into sobs.  
  
All her pent-up anguish poured out. Soon she was retching violently on the ground, emptying her stomach until there was nothing left, before shakily standing and making her way home.

I’m a 22-year-old guy and I’ve known this girl (21F) for about 5 years. We spent around a year emotionally involved in something like a situationship — not officially dating, but closer than friends.

The connection was really confusing. Sometimes we were emotionally close (hugging, lying together, talking about marriage), but nothing physical ever happened. I developed feelings, but her behavior often left me unsure of how she felt.

She’d ignore my messages randomly, then reappear. She talked to many other guys on social media, which made me feel insecure. She sometimes shared personal problems with me, and even asked for money, which I gave — but she never brought it up again. That hurt more emotionally than financially.

What really broke my trust was when she lied about something small: she told me she had to go to work early, but I later found out she had gone for coffee with a friend. It seemed minor, but it made me feel like I couldn’t believe her anymore.

She never apologized for anything, even when I was clearly hurt. But at the same time, she sometimes did small kind things — like buying me a phone case or offering to wash my hoodie. She was even in touch with my grandmother, which made everything feel more serious.

Eventually, I blocked her on everything except phone. She never reached out, never said sorry. Now, weeks later, she’s  started posting things on social media — cryptic videos about people walking away or cutting off contact, and profile pictures from places where we were together.

I’m really struggling to understand whether she was just confused like I was, or if she never took things seriously and didn’t respect me.

I need advice:
Should  reach out to her for closure, or just let it be and move on completely?
Has anyone else been through something like this — where someone acted close but gave off mixed signals and never took responsibility?

Chapter 1
After discovering that Kason had been secretly seeing his mistress for three years and was planning to marry her, I decided to leave him and return home for an arranged marriage.
On the first day, I handed the engagement ring he had given me to his mistress.
On the second day, I discarded everything that reminded me of him.
On the third day, I put on my wedding dress and married his arch-rival, Ronan.
From that day forward, Kason and I were no longer connected.
Kason scoffed, thinking I was just throwing a tantrum.
Until he saw the news of my marriage to someone else.
Only then did he panic.
==============================
In the office, the two of them were completely unaware of my presence outside the door.
I poured out the coffee I had made for Kason and left.
Kason had always kissed me with such care, so I had never seen him so passionate before.
Now I knew it was because he had given that side of himself to someone else.
I had thought I could marry for love, but reality had hit me hard.
Numb and disheveled, I wiped away my tears and took a cab back to the mansion.

But one thing i can say for sure is, living doesn't sounds exciting anymore.

I've been having it rough these couple months, overthinking about my past, what i could've did, about my future, where am i going and about the current, what should i do. Im just 22yo this year and everytime i look at the social media, I can't help myself but compare what am i lacking compared to others. Seeing how people being able to smile genuinely, hang out with their groups with no issues very often, striving healthily in their life with good success.

I can't say that i have none of that, I graduated from my diploma, currently working, i have a couple of friends and in fact im living with my friends currently and we sometimes do something fun together. My family is all great as well but I can't seem to find what's this missing void i have in myself. I tried to fill it in with lots of things, working out, exploring new places, drinking, drugs (just marijuana no hard drugs here) and I can't seem to find the thing that could fit this void. I feel shit for having things in my life to appreciate for but yet at the same time feel so empty as if I have no goal in life. I do have goals, to get my dream job, to buy my parents a house, bring them travel, be able to spend money more leisurely when im out with my friends. But yet all these is not putting my mind in right track.

I wonder if it has to do with my ex that i broke up with few years ago, but, I no longer seek for love and i have no desire to even connect with someone to that level anymore so i doubt that. Talking about connections, I can't open myself to new people no more now compared to how i was back then. Everything just feels suffocating now, everyday waking up doesn't feel like a new day , a new fresh start, instead, it felt like a horrible routine or terrifying unknown day i have to go through. Im not even sure on how to get through this phase anymore, back then i can bring myself to open up about it to certain of my friends. But now, everyone has their own life, bothering them about my thoughts just feels like im still stuck as a child that can't lead his own life. Im not sure what to do anymore, my fear of heights starting to become curiosity, what if i jumped. My fear of dying also becoming the same, what if once you die u just die, nothing to think or whatsoever, no other world, no heaven no hell, just pure black and void.

I tried to learn about everything so I can achieve the happiness i wanted, from philosophical things in life to scientific things, politics, accounting, coffees and teas, animals , technology, there's too much to list, even unnecessary things, that maybe i could find that 1 things that could make intrigued in life and attached to like it. Im not sure anymore there seems nothing left for me in this world that could make me feel better anymore. I thought of suicide but that would make my parents, my close friends and some people feel upset, sad, and confused so im not resorting to that. Not yet. Till then, everyday now and then, this feels like punishment. Hell on earth. an eternity that i will never escape. I wish i could die without worrying anyone, i guess i couldn't so i hope i lost my memories of everything. Just so i could relearn, rexpose myself again, to gain the excitement from discovering something new, something like how cake taste like, or how donuts are like. U understand right? The word, rise and shine, new day new start is nothing to me anymore. I wanna stop all this.",2,1751047057.0,depression,0,1.0,False

# Chapter 1

Mila POV

“Do as your mother says.”

Stepmother, you mean, I wanted to say. Instead, I stood silently, my lips pressed into a thin line, as my father informed me that I had to go on this so-called weekend trip they had planned with his friend. I know why exactly this trip was planned and I would rather stay away from it.

The plan is to go on a weekend getaway in the vacation house of My father’s dangerous, mafia friend. Killian Knight. If you’re smart, you stay out of his way. If you’re wise, you become his friend—if you can manage it, that is.

I’ve never met him, only seen photos, but I know enough. And what I know is enough for me to decide that he is too dangerous and too close to my father for comfort. He kills people for a living, and I’ve decided I’d rather live my life without the constant threat of being snuffed out in my sleep. Besides, I can’t go on this little ""family-friendly"" trip. I’ll never have an opportunity like this again: three days alone, unsupervised. There are things I need to do and people to expose.

“But Father…”

“No buts!”

I refrained from rolling my eyes.

From the corner of my eye, I saw Adeline—my dearest stepmother—wearing a smug expression. She tried her best to suppress it in front of my father. She wants this, she wants to secure her son's position as the next chairperson of Anderson Cooperate Empire and also doesn't let anyone know that she is stealing my rights.

The look on my father’s face told me it was pointless to argue.

I am so not in the mood to play Happy Family charade.

“Understood,” I said, trying my best not to roll my eyes or give a sigh. I think I partially lost in the end.

“Don’t look like I’ve just killed your cat. This is a family vacation, and Mr. Knight and his wife have so graciously chosen to host us. I don’t want anyone backing out. We’ll enjoy it like a family,” he said, his rough voice sounding like he had something stuck in his throat.

“Yes, my dear, we most certainly will,” Adeline added, placing her hand over his in what seemed like a loving gesture. My father smiled at her sweetly.

I held back my gag reflex.

“I’ll excuse myself, Father.”

He nodded without looking at me, and I slowly walked out of the study.

The devil’s spawn—my stepbrother—was leaning against the wall, waiting with a smirk on his face. I was sure he was there to gloat over my failed attempt to escape this hell trip.

“Told you it’d never work. Father holds the Knights in high regard, and Mr. Knight invited the whole family, little sis,” he sneered.

“It’s bold of you to assume I consider you family,” I shot back.

“Be careful, sister. If Father hears you talking like that…” He put a hand to his chest in mock injury, then his expression darkened as he cocked his head. “You’ll be out of here.”

I gave him no response to his obvious threat. It was a threat that could very well come true any of these days considering my 21st birthday day is exactly one month away. It will be my end or I will be free from this prison I am forced to call home.

I slipped away down the hallway, past the lobby, and toward the giant staircase leading to the South Wing of the mansion.

This is the Andersons’ ancestral house. My father, Tommen Anderson, is the third-generation Chairman of Anderson Group Of Companies, a multinational company worth over $3 trillion. As his firstborn, I am technically the heir to this corporate empire. But if my stepmother’s scheming works, my stepbrother might end up taking over the company.

I don't need Anderson Empire or neither I am so stuck up to hold on to the fact what was supposed to be mine and create havoc for it. The truth of my life is the shackle around my feet is this legacy and the only way to free it is to own it.

I remember it quite clearly when it was tied to me.

“Only an Anderson will sit on this chair. You must promise me, Mila,” my grandfather said when he first made me sit on the chairman’s chair behind the large, old mahogany desk at Anderson Tech’s headquarters. I was ten years old and had only recently learned that I was an Anderson.

I still remember him kneeling in front of me, looking me in the eye as I sat in the highest chair at Anderson Tech. His sea green eyes—Anderson's eyes, the same eyes I see in the mirror every day— were cold, just like my father.

“You are the only valid candidate,”

I didn't know what to think until it became clear that I had just transferred from an iron cage - my orphanage to a golden one - the Anderson Mansion. He was nothing but a jailer.

Two years later, he passed away.

This weekend was supposed to be my lone opportunity to act without Adeline or Nicolas breathing down my neck. Three consecutive days… but damn her for playing the perfect mother, pretending to care.

For five years, I’ve been careful with every move I make. All anyone knows about me is that I’m an introverted art history student at New York University with massive social anxiety. A simple girl who thought she was an orphan and is now just \*grateful\* to have a family.

Adeline wants to control my every move. She’s no fool, though. She knows she has nothing concrete on me. She has always played the part of a concerned mother. I have seen her actual colors. I will not be waiting for that side to come up again.

My plans will have to wait.

I packed my bag, and the next morning, we were on our way. My father and stepmother rode in the Mercedes, while I was stuck with my stepbrother, Nicolas, and half-sister, Francesca, in the BMW.

“It’s been a while since we went to the beach. I’m excited!” Francesca—or Franny, as she insisted we call her—gushed.

I like her, surprisingly. She’s not annoying. But I hate her hair—the glossy platinum blonde she inherited from her mother. It fell in perfect waves and looked even more angelic paired with the peach beach dress she was wearing. Her eyes were like mine, like my father’s, like my grandfather’s. She is Anderson, after all. Probably the only one who didn't look at me like I was a stranger.

I opened my phone, put in my earbuds, and watched a text pop onto the screen.

Are you coming today? \~ J

Later. \~ M

When? \~ J

3 d. \~ M

Damn \~ J

Yeah, yeah. You and I both.

We left the chaotic rhythm of New York City behind, merging onto the highway as the skyline faded in the rearview mirror. The air changed—cleaner, tinged with salt. A few hours later, we pulled into the Hamptons and parked in front of a grand beach house.

The car came to a halt, and I pulled my earbuds out. As I stepped out, the scent of sea salt filled my senses. If I had to find one redeeming quality about this trip, it was this view. I’d endure the monotonous gathering just for this.

“This is so beautiful!” Franny gushed again.

I glanced at the property where we’d be spending the weekend.

A wide, wraparound porch supported by white pillars overlooked the dunes, while tall, arched windows reflected the fading sunlight. Sprawling gardens surrounded the house, with perfectly manicured lawns stretching toward the sand. Vibrant flower beds lined the walkways, and mature trees cast dappled shadows over a stone fountain at the center of the property. The estate radiated timeless elegance—a true sanctuary.

Nicolas stepped out of the car, groaning dramatically as he put on his sunglasses.

“It’s too hot,” he whined, tugging at the collar of his bright red shirt. A red shirt on a beach trip—typical.

I shook my head, slipping my phone and earbuds into my sling bag and shutting the car door. Still, my gaze lingered on the spectacular view. What would it be like to call a place like this your own?

“Oh, well, we were waiting for you!”

An elegant woman in a white beach dress stepped onto the porch. She was lean, with an A-line figure and a height that gave her a commanding presence. Her warm smile, framed by red-painted lips, greeted my parents.

“Kate, thank you for having us,” Adeline said, performing one of those air kisses high-class women exchange. Kate followed up with a light kiss on my father’s cheek.

“How are you, Kate? It’s been a while,” my father said in what I assumed was his version of a charming tone.

“I’m great. Killian and I have been looking forward to this.”

“Where is my friend—”

As if on cue, our host stepped onto the porch.

Khaki pants. A dark blue, fitted shirt that emphasized his broad shoulders and lean, muscular arms. He ran his hands through his hair, dark and tousled, gleaming under the sunlight.

My breath hitched when his eyes locked on mine.

# Chapter 2

Mila POV

Killian Knight had a presence about him. Even as he walked lazily toward us, it felt as though the very air surrounding him was his domain. His aura dared you to challenge his authority—or look away from him.

“He’s hot!” Nicolai muttered under his breath.

“He’s married,” Franny reminded him.

“So what? Doesn’t mean I don’t have eyes.”

I rolled my eyes at Nicolai.

Mr. Knight removed his glasses as he greeted my father. I instinctively stepped back, away from his line of sight. Father introduced Adeline first, then Nicolai, and finally Franny. Killian nodded in acknowledgment, his actions polite, graceful, and measured.

Something crackled in the air, and my gaze moved to his on its own accord. My hand twitched with an unnamed urge, and I quickly shoved it into my pocket, confused. My heart was thundering in my chest. Was it fear?

I reminded myself that our families had shared generations of friendship. I was just as safe here as in my own home—or so I told myself. I’d always lived this way, constantly questioning. What was there to be scared of now? I wasn’t one to back away from challenges, but I had to keep my stance neutral.

“And who is this?” That deep, sophisticated voice caressed the air as it directed a question toward me.

“This is Mila,” my father answered simply and quickly. His indifference was nothing new to me, but I’d thought—perhaps hoped—that in some corner of his heart, there might be an obligation to pretend otherwise.

“Mila,” Killian repeated, a smile gracing his lips as he stepped aside, his gaze fixing on me with unnerving precision. “Your eldest.”

The glint in his eyes reminded me of a black panther. A jolt of something ran through me, and the air seemed to thin. Mistaking my reaction for fear, I tried to suppress the rush of emotions as he extended his hand toward me.

“It’s a sweet name,” he said.

Without much thought, I slid my hand into his. His touch was surprisingly warm—the kind of warmth you feel sitting by a fire during a snowstorm. Close enough to savor the heat but wary of the burn.

My breath hitched as his large, rough hand enclosed mine, making my own feel small. The sensation sent a shiver down my spine, one I struggled to suppress. My heart raced, and an unfamiliar undercurrent climbed through my nerves. Meeting his eyes again, I gave this feeling a name. It wasn’t fear. It was desire.

“Shall we?” Kate’s voice broke the spell, and my head snapped toward her.

Hell. What was I doing? I withdrew my hand quickly.

“Yes, we shall.” A casual smile lingered on Killian’s lips as he stepped aside.

“This way, Princess,” he murmured, so low I wasn’t sure I’d heard it right.

Kate and the others were already several steps ahead, but Killian walked right beside me. I schooled my expression, but it was difficult to ignore him when I was so hyper-aware of his every move.

“Nina will show you to your rooms. Once you’re settled, I’ll give you a tour,” Kate said.

I didn’t stop or turn to acknowledge her as Nina, the head of the staff, led us. At the foot of the stairs, Killian halted, and I caught the faint trace of perfume. My pace quickened.

“Killian, sweetie,” a voice called from behind.

Damn it. What was I thinking? He’s married.

I am bewitched. Mila Anderson cannot be human and real at the same time. Those sea-green siren eyes were meant to drown every soul they landed on. Her dark red hair cascaded to her waist, and the ripped jeans hugged her curves so perfectly it was almost criminal. She clutched the straps of her messenger bag as if her life depended on it, standing behind her family with her shoulders hunched. But when her eyelids fluttered and her gaze met mine—she had me, right then and there.

Anderson had never brought his entire family with him before. I’ve met his wife and his stepson, who seems to be his shadow. But I’ve never met his daughters. I’ve only caught a glimpse of the youngest once. This one must be the eldest. After a polite greeting, I finally turned my attention to the object of my interest. Mila.

The moment her hand slipped into mine, I knew there was no going back. The current that surged through me wasn’t just attraction or desire—it was something much deeper. Something undeniable.

As Nina showed our guests to their rooms, Mila lingered, trailing behind the others. Halfway up the staircase, she stopped. It would have been too obvious if I followed her, but resisting the pull was damn near impossible. I stayed rooted at the foot of the stairs, my eyes locked on her. She turned slightly, just enough for the corner of her eye to catch mine. I smiled.

She hesitated, almost turning fully toward me, as though she could feel the electric charge between us, pulsing, connecting her to me.

“Killian, sweetie,” Kate’s voice cut through the moment like a knife. Mila jumped and bolted up the stairs.

“Damn you, Katherine,” I muttered under my breath.

I stalked into the kitchen, where Kate leaned against the counter, watching me warily. Her expression told me she knew exactly what was going through my mind.

“If someone saw you looking at her like that, it wouldn’t end well,” she said, her tone cautious but laced with apology.

I folded my arms and tilted my head, smirking. “And how exactly am I looking at her?”

“Like you’re going to devour her,” she shot back bluntly.

“I don’t need a reminder of what I can or can’t do,” I said, my voice sharp.

Kate hesitated before continuing. “She’s Anderson’s daughter. She’s young. Innocent. Don’t seduce her. That wouldn’t be... prudent.”

“Are you trying to be my wife now?” I arched an eyebrow, my tone challenging.

She flinched, unable to meet my gaze. “I have no desire to be,” she muttered, shaking her head.

I pulled out a chair, the legs scraping noisily against the floor as I sat down. The sound made her flinch again, but only for a moment. She straightened, likely reminding herself of her place. Kate was one of the best in my organization. She couldn’t afford to show weakness.

“I’m your friend, Killian,” she said carefully. “This could turn into a disaster. Find someone else for your amusement.”

I leaned back, and her shoulders visibly relaxed.

“You’re misunderstanding my intentions,” I said, my tone deceptively calm.

Her eyes narrowed. “What do you mean? You’re serious about her? You just met her!”

I sighed, leaning forward lazily. “Kate.” My voice was soft, but the warning was unmistakable. “Don’t forget who I am.”

Her expression shifted instantly. Her posture straightened, the same way all my shadows do in my presence—alert, ready, and obedient.

“Yes, sir,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

I stood, and she stepped aside instinctively.

“Don’t interrupt me again,” I said as I walked past her.

She gave a sharp nod, and I left without another word.

# Chapter 3

Mila's POV

Killian Knight—the most dangerous man in the U.S.A. A mafia boss. A contract killer. Married.

 I repeated the mantra to myself, willing away the electric charge coursing through me.

My guest room was the last one in the corridor. I thanked Nina, shut the door behind her, and tossed my bag onto the four-poster bed. Pouring myself a glass of water, I downed it in seconds.

Maybe I’d neglected my body’s physical needs for far too long. There was no way I could be attracted to danger.

Throwing myself onto the bed, I took a few calming breaths. This had to be some form of shock.

Before I could dwell on it further, my phone rang. It was J.

 “Are you serious?” Her incredulous tone greeted me.

I sighed. “I know. I couldn’t get out of it. I tried.”

 “You’re in Killian Knight’s house!”

 I shivered—for reasons that had nothing to do with fear.

“I know,” I replied quietly.

J sighed, clearly worried. “Look, I’m cool with a lot of things, and if he were anyone else, I’d say seduce him and take the Anderson empire. But M! He’s dangerous. Get out of there! We don’t know what your evil stepmother is planning.”

I swallowed hard. It would be foolish to say I wasn’t wary, but Jina didn’t need to know that. She was worried enough for the both of us.

“Don’t worry. No one’s going to kill me here,” I scoffed. I hope.

“This isn’t something to take lightly. The man runs a contract killer organization!” she whisper-hissed.

 “And it makes no sense to kill me here,” I mimicked her tone.

 “You just like to play with fire.”

 “What’s life without a little danger?”

 “I don’t need you quoting Harry Potter to me. We have K for that,” she snapped.

I snickered.

“Mila.” Her serious tone stopped me.

 “Hm?”

 “Just don’t die.”

 “Yes, ma’am.”

I hung up, and the smile slipped from my face. Honestly, I’d rather be with J and K than here. My stepmother’s scheming could rot in hell.

Out tour of the house ended by the poolside

As the others retreated inside, I lingered by the poolside. No one noticed as I crouched down, resting my chin on my knees. My heart felt heavy with a sense of lack. My family was always fake, carefully curated for appearances. My father’s indifference, my stepmother’s schemes, and my siblings’ endless competition made it impossible to feel anything real. Even Kate’s warm smiles felt staged, a part of her duty as a host. Everything here was a charade, just like my life.

When would I experience something genuine?

“Do you swim?”

Startled, I nearly tumbled into the water, but a strong arm wrapped around my waist, pulling me back from inches away from breaking the surface.

I gasped as I collided with something solid. The relaxed air thickened around us, and warmth spread from my stomach to my chest. Cinnamon and coffee enveloped my senses as I looked up.

Killian’s dark eyes met mine, their lethal glint holding me captive.

 “Mr. Knight,” I whispered.

We both were on the floor. I quickly put some distance between us, standing as he got up smoothly, resting an arm on his knee. The corner of his lips turned up. Why did those lips look so soft and inviting as he looked up at me, his hair falling onto his forehead as he cocked his head to the side? Did he look at everyone like that? Like he knew every secret they held, or he could see straight into the core of them?

“Are you alright?”

I nodded. I couldn’t trust my voice right now. I didn’t think I had enough air in my lungs to speak, anyway. I should have moved, but my feet stayed rooted there. He got up swiftly, his movements smooth.

“I didn’t mean to startle you. My apologies,” he said softly, giving a little nod.

I nodded and stepped back.

 “It’s fine. I will…” I pointed to the door leading inside.

“You didn’t answer.”

His voice was soft, alluring.

 “About?” I turned back to look at him in confusion.

“Do you swim?”

“I don’t know how to swim, but it’s nice here,” I said. Is telling a certified killer you can’t swim a good idea? Nope. I needed to get out of his presence. I didn’t have control of my mind—or my mouth—around him.

“Mila!” Franny’s voice came floating. Thank God for her.

“I should go,” I said, moving quickly. I exhaled the moment I was out of his sight.

Killian's POV

The dinner table was set. All that was left was to choose a wine.

I went to the back of the house and opened the cellar door. My grandfather’s wine collection was vast, filled with complex and meticulously aged vintage blends. Now, some of my choices were part of the collection too. Under the yellow light of the basement, I walked through the aisle, mulling over my options.

Finally, I made my choice—Dal Forno Romano Amarone della Valpolicella. Aged meticulously for over a decade, it held notes of dark chocolate, espresso, and a subtle spice.

As I headed back upstairs, wine in hand, I passed the staircase toward the kitchen. The sound of light footsteps made me pause. A glimpse out of the corner of my eye stopped me in my tracks.

And there she was.

Mila stood at the top of the staircase, looking down at her feet. Trails of red hair framed her small, square face, falling from a delicate half-braid. The rest of her hair flowed in soft waves over her shoulders. She wore a simple white, long-sleeved V-neck dress that fell below her knees, its hem tinged with a soft shade of blue.

I smiled. She was simple, yet there was something about the way she carried herself that made her impossible to ignore.

Finally, her gaze lifted, and those sea-green eyes widened when they met mine. I smirked in greeting.

For several seconds, no breath passed between us.

“Are you just going to stand there?” I asked, breaking the silence.

At my question, her feet moved—only for her to miss a step.

 “Mila,” I called her name. Was this the first time I’d said it out loud? I couldn’t be sure.

“Are you not planning to join us?” I eased my smile and extended a hand. She looked at it, her expression softening instead of becoming wary, like most people in my presence.

“Come with me.”

She descended a couple of steps before stopping, a small frown appearing as she looked up at me. When she reached the last step, I didn’t move aside.

Her red lips parted slightly.

“Can you drink?” I asked.

“Legally, no,” she shrugged.

 “How old are you?”

 “I’ll be 21 in a month.”

 “You’re young.”

She stepped back a little, breaking our eye contact. “Do I look older to you?”

She tried to step around me.

 “No.”

 “Then what?”

I finally moved, letting her pass, the angle bringing her head close to my chin. I leaned toward her ear.

 “The most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen.”

She stopped, turning sharply to look at me. Her sea-green eyes weren’t filled with confusion—but awareness. A spark of disbelief flickered in their depths.

“You shouldn’t be saying that,” she whispered. She didn’t look offended or put off.

 “I like to state facts.”

Blowing a stray strand of hair from her cheek, I walked away with a teasing smile.

# Chapter 4

Killian's POV 

When Tommen asked me about this get-together, I thought he was just following tradition—reestablishing the Anderson-Knight generational friendship that his grandfather and mine had started. It was meant to ensure the new generation understood the bonds not just of business but of familial relationships. Yet, I’ve never gotten the impression he cared about any of that. Personally, I don’t either. Only tradition forces me to oblige the Andersons. We meet to discuss business logistics when required, but beyond that, we can barely be called business associates.

I first got to know him during one of these trips. The Hamptons house—our family’s vacation home—is far removed from the world I truly live in. It’s just another façade, like everything else in my life. This place has always served this purpose. With no real explanation for his request, I decided to humor him.

After dinner, we stepped into the garden. He lit a cigarette, and I slid my hands into my pockets, standing under the yellow glow of the garden lights. I looked at him—at the bags under his eyes, barely concealed by the arrogant tilt of his head or the sparkle of his Rolex. My jaw clenched. I despise cigarettes.

“I don’t allow smoking in my presence,” I warned.

“Come now, Killian,” he replied dismissively.

I should never have humored this man. I fixed him with a cold stare, watching as he visibly shivered. He tried to hide it, but the arrogant glint vanished from his eyes. Now he was probably remembering exactly where he was and who he was with. The cigarette fell to the ground, and he stubbed it out. I looked away, impatient.

He seemed nervous now, which wasn’t unusual—I’m used to people reacting that way around me. But his cold eyes reminded me of someone else. Mila. Her wide, shocked eyes and flushed cheeks from our earlier interaction flitted through my mind. I’d much rather be seeing her.

He wasn’t speaking, and I was curious about one thing. One person.

“Tell me about Mila,” I said.

At dinner, her downcast eyes and slumped shoulders had caught my attention. The woman who had looked me in the eye and all but scolded me earlier wasn’t the same woman at that table. That woman had seemed more like a shy girl who couldn’t speak to save her life.

“She’s your eldest, yet you’ve never brought her around before.”

“Don’t be bothered by her. Since her mother died, she’s been reserved. No one’s managed to draw her out of her shell, and she prefers it that way. Adeline insisted she come,” he explained.

During her time here, Mila had only spoken to people when politeness demanded it. She wasn’t close to her stepmother, but from what little I’d seen, she got along with her younger sister.

Tommen’s indifference toward his eldest daughter was glaringly obvious. I clenched my fist in my pocket, noting the affection he seemed to reserve for his second wife. Mila’s lack of interaction with her family made sense, but there was something about the fearlessness in her eyes that felt... different.

“I called you out here to talk about my son,” he finally said, breaking the silence.

My instincts went on high alert as I sensed movement at the corner of a wall about ten feet away. I shifted slightly to keep both Tommen and the shadow in my view. A shoulder peeked out from behind the wall.

“Your stepson,” I corrected, watching his reaction.

“My son needs your support when the board votes for the next chairperson.”

“Why would there be a vote?”

The Anderson succession plan had always been clear: the firstborn Anderson would take the seat. Despite this 70-year-old tradition, which made no distinction between genders, every generation thus far had conveniently produced firstborn sons. By that logic, Mila Anderson should be the next chairperson.

Tommen’s desire to have his stepson as heir would undoubtedly stir controversy among the board.

“You know the board. They’re a bunch of outdated fools who cling to tradition, insisting the firstborn Anderson should take the chair,” he said, clearly agitated.

“And yet you believe your stepson is a more suitable candidate, even though he’s not an Anderson?”

“He is an Anderson,” Tommen said, meeting my eyes for the first time. Interesting.

He looked away, taking a sharp breath.

“The Anderson-Knight bond is the foundation of both our empires. We need strong leaders to uphold that bond. You’ll find Nicolai far more capable than Mila,” he continued.

There were too many pieces of this puzzle that didn’t fit. Normally, I wouldn’t concern myself with such matters, but now... this was becoming intriguing. I needed more information.

“I’ll think about it,” I said, watching his reaction.

It wasn’t the answer he wanted, but he wisely chose not to argue. Nodding reluctantly, he turned to leave.

“Very well, then. It’s settled,” I said, dismissing him.

As he walked away, a puff of smoke curled from the corner of the wall. My lips twitched. Tut-tut.

I approached the wall quietly, keeping my steps light, but the shadow moved as if sensing me. Rounding the corner, I caught a flash of red disappearing around the next wall. I glanced down at my feet, noting the half-smoked cigarette lying on the ground, its embers fading.",1,1751047048.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

I hope you’re having a cozy, calm, or at least slightly sweet kind of day. I’m reaching out with an open heart, looking for a cuddle buddy (female) and maybe a new friend here in the Netherlands — ideally near Amsterdam, but anywhere not too far works too!

I’m not looking for any sexual activity and I stick to what we agree. 

A little about me:

• I'm 35 years old guy working as an executive and happily calling Amsterdam home for over 3 years now.
• I live alone, take care of myself, and try to stay fit — but also never say no to dessert.
• I’d be happy to host or come to you — whatever makes you feel safe and comfortable.
• I love being outside, especially in the summer — picnics, strolls, a lazy lunch on a sunny terrace… simple things, really.
•Traveling is a big part of my life and dreams — I’d love to see the whole world, one new place (and snack) at a time.
• I’m a good listener — friends often say I make them feel calm and heard. You’ll get lots of warm, respectful hugs and cozy company if that’s what you need 🤗
• Cleanliness and kindness go hand in hand for me — I value both deeply.
• I'm 183 cm tall, 80 kg, have broad shoulders, little muscular, tanned skin, black hair, brown eyes.

What I’m looking for:

Someone to share gentle, genuine connection with — whether that’s cuddling up on the couch, sharing a quiet moment over coffee, or just chatting about our days.

I’m also open to making new friends — movie nights, cooking together, mini-adventures nearby… whatever brings joy without pressure.

And of course, if you’d prefer to meet in a public space first, that’s absolutely fine — your comfort always comes first.

So if you’re someone who values kindness, closeness, and maybe the occasional silly laugh — I’d really love to hear from you. 💛

Let’s make a little space in this busy world for warmth and connection.

Looking forward to saying hi on DM!!

Back here for Round 2.

I’d posted a while back looking for accountability partners, and while it sparked some initial connections, it kinda fizzled out. So I’m putting the call out again—with clearer intent and renewed energy.

I’m a 39M from Bangalore on a mission to turn things around—body, mind, and lifestyle. I know the drill: keto/low-carb eating, regular movement, good sleep. 

So, I’m looking to connect with a **small, committed crew**—who are genuinely serious about health and life goals, but also up for sharing the ups and downs that come with it. Not a massive group—just a handful of folks who want to check in, support each other, and maybe build something real along the way.

A bit about me: I’m an introvert (not shy, just slow to warm up). But once we vibe, I’m fully engaged, talk a mile a minute, and love cheering people on. I’m in **Bangalore**, and while I’m happy to connect with anyone online, if you’re local, we could meet up now and then for walks, workouts, or even coffee check-ins ☕.

If you're trying to:

* Eat better 🍳
* Move more 🏋️‍♂️
* Sleep smarter 😴
* And finally stay consistent ✅

Then DM or drop a comment.  
**Bonus: I’ve still got that bucket list waiting—and I’d love to go through it with my tribe** 💥

My billionaire husband spends millions on sponsored a college girl's art exhibition, but refuses to pay $2,000 for our son's medical treatment.  
  
After my son died from severe diarrhea and dehydration right before my eyes, completely shattered, I handed my husband divorce papers.  
  
When Dominic saw the death certificate attached to the agreement, he actually couldn't hold back a laugh:  
  
""Sorry, I just had no idea someone could actually die from diarrhea.""  
  
""I know you're upset, but don't worry. Dahlia's having the baby in three days.""  
  
""She's such a thoughtful, grateful girl. We already worked it all out—once her baby's born, we'll hand it over to you. All you need to do is keep being Mrs. Reid. Just one thing though—Dahlia needs to be able to visit the kid whenever she wants.""  
  
""Don't bother,"" I replied with a bitter smile.  
  
""Let's just divorce.""  
  
...  
  
When my attempts to get money from Dominic failed, I sold the ridiculously expensive engagement ring he'd once had custom-made—for a fraction of its worth.  
  
Rushing back to the hospital with what little cash I had, I heard the ominous beeping of machines echoing down the long corridor toward my son's room.  
  
Then, in seconds, the world fell into a suffocating silence, as if someone had hit pause on reality itself.  
  
""I'm so sorry, Mrs. Winters...""  
  
""To be honest... If you'd been able to pay for the medication just a few days earlier, your child would have been fine.""  
  
""Hospital policy is very clear—we cannot provide medication when payment hasn't been processed. I'm truly sorry, Mrs. Winters. We truly did everything we could... Please accept our deepest condolences.""  
  
I opened my mouth, but my throat felt like it was stuffed with razor blades wrapped in cotton—choking and painful—making it impossible to form a single coherent sound.  
  
Dragging my leaden legs to the bedside, I couldn't comprehend how to face my son's death.  
  
Just this morning, he had managed to summon a smile and call me ""Mommy"" from that same hospital bed.  
  
The TV mounted on the stark white wall flickered momentarily before regaining signal. Dominic's face appeared on screen.  
  
There he was, smiling—the man known for his cold public demeanor now standing warmly behind Dahlia, the college poor girl he ""sponsored,"" graciously greeting every gallery visitor with uncharacteristic charm.  
  
Some bold attendee, completely unafraid of the cameras and social media livestreams, openly speculated about their relationship:  
  
""With my years of experience reading people, I suspect there's more between Mr. Reid and our talented Miss Hayes than just a sponsorship arrangement.""  
  
""Come on, tell us! Are wedding bells in your future?""  
  
Hearing this, Dahlia blushed amid the teasing remarks, her eyes continuously seeking Dominic's, filled with unmistakable love and shy affection.  
  
""But isn't Mr. Reid married? His son is five years old. Have they divorced quietly without announcing it?""  
  
A brief, uncomfortable silence fell over the crowd. The person who asked quickly retreated into the crowd, suddenly fearful.  
  
Dahlia's eyes instantly welled up with embarrassment on camera. She turned to Dominic hesitantly:  
  
""Master, why didn't your wife come to the exhibition? Is she still upset about what happened at the auction? Perhaps I should visit her again and apologize properly.""  
  
Without a moment's hesitation, Dominic rejected the idea.  
  
""No need.""  
  
""I've spoiled her into becoming too petty. Imagine making such a fuss over a mere set of jewelry—even striking you over it. Since she's become so materialistic, I've decided not to give her another cent. I can't let that slap you received go unanswered.""  
  
""Seeing her take out her frustrations on you infuriates me.""  
  
His protective tone convinced everyone that our marriage was indeed falling apart, and somehow I had become the villain responsible for its demise.  
  
""Mrs. Reid must be incredibly petty and calculating. Dealing with someone like that would drain anyone's soul. No wonder Mr. Reid found comfort elsewhere.""  
  
""Let's set that aside for a moment—what about their child? If they really divorce and Mr. Reid continues with Miss Hayes, she'll eventually become a stepmother. Being a stepmother in a wealthy family is no easy role.""  
  
Seeing these, my heart felt like it was being repeatedly dropped into boiling oil, sizzling and burning a thousand times over.  
  
I couldn't distinguish whether my chest contained more grief or rage.  
  
The hospital room's air conditioning was set painfully low. Countless cold drafts penetrated my body, making me shiver violently. I couldn't help but turn to the family beside the neighboring bed:  
  
""Could you please turn up the temperature? My little boy has severe diarrhea and can't afford to get any colder.""  
  
I don't know how much time passed, but that cold still burrowed into my heart. I looked up impatiently, only to meet the nurse's horrified expression.  
  
""Mrs. Winters... family members aren't normally allowed to stay in the morgue for more than fifteen minutes. You've been here half the afternoon. Please, you need to leave now. The director is waiting for you to sign the death certificate.""  
  
""And the child's father—he's never once appeared. Now that the child is gone, surely he should show his face? Please contact him immediately.""  
  
My mind suddenly exploded with clarity.  
  
I finally returned to reality, stumbling to my feet as I made my way toward the door.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
The death certificate process moved quickly.  
  
Within two hours, I stood near an air vent, my hands shaking as I called the funeral home.  
  
Afterward, I called Dominic more than thirty times. Predictably, he never answered.  
  
Leaning against the cold tile wall, I laughed bitterly at myself.  
  
The funeral home staff collected my son's body before the hospital director finished his shift. Throughout the journey, I lost consciousness from crying countless times.  
  
At the funeral home, they immediately placed my son in cold storage, then gently advised me that I could bring his favorite clothes for him to wear—To leave this world clean and neat.  
  
Of course.  
  
My son, just like Dominic, was always fastidious about cleanliness.  
  
""Typically, cremation occurs within 72 hours of arrival at the funeral home. However, if family members request it, we can extend this period—3 days, 5 days, or 7 days. Do you have a preference?""  
  
I reached out to touch my son's face, now devoid of warmth.  
  
""3 days will be fine.""  
  
...  
  
I returned home in a daze well after midnight.  
  
When Dominic saw me, the smile in his eyes instantly disappeared.  
  
""Why are you back so late? Is Austin feeling better? Dahlia heard he's been having diarrhea and has been worried sick. She specifically asked me to bring home two boxes of medicine for him.""  
  
I dodged the medicine he held out, noticing the date on the package. A cold smile crossed my face as tears streamed down uncontrollably.  
  
""Expired medication? Who is she trying to kill?""  
  
Dominic's expression froze. He turned the box to see the manufacturing date, then his face flashed with irritation.  
  
""Dahlia simply didn't notice, that's all. Can't you speak without these constant jabs? You know pregnant women need to be super careful with medication. She probably had to travel all the way across town just to get those few pills. Besides, she's just a girl in her twenties—how is she supposed to know all that stuff?""""  
  
""And why didn't you attend Dahlia's art exhibition today? I told you days ago how important this event was, yet you deliberately chose to be difficult on this specific day?""  
  
He instinctively criticized me to defend Dahlia. Somehow, he had become blind to my red, swollen eyes.  
  
""Do you remember why you started sponsoring Dahlia in the first place?""  
  
Dominic stiffened, swallowing whatever criticism he was about to deliver.  
  
""You've forgotten, haven't you?""  
  
""Do you recall when your relationship with her crossed the line?""  
  
I looked at him calmly. ""Do you remember what you said to me after I discovered your one-night indiscretion?""  
  
A heavy silence filled the living room. The faint scent of rock rose in the air pulled both Dominic and me back to the past.  
  
Dahlia was a college student Dominic had brought back from a remote area during a business trip two years ago. At that time, she was bitter about her fate because her family wanted to marry her off to the village chief's son.  
  
She cried about her difficult educational journey and accused her parents of favoritism. Her determined expression moved Dominic.  
  
So, the billionaire CEO decided to sponsor her education, bringing her back and enrolling her in a prestigious university not far from our home.  
  
He bought her an apartment, provided her with a luxury car, and even gave her a black card for spending money.  
  
Gradually, Dominic grew closer to her and more distant from me. Even our son ceased to matter to him.  
  
Finally, one night when he was working late, Dominic went to the wrong home.  
  
When I discovered them, he knelt on the ground, repeatedly grabbing my hand to slap his own face.  
  
""I'm sorry, Lyra. It's my fault. I drank too much at the business dinner. She was forced by me...""  
  
""I promise it's just this once. I won't see her again after this, and once she graduates, I'll stop sponsoring her.""  
  
Then, Dahlia became pregnant.  
  
Thinking of this, a mocking smile twisted my lips.  
  
""Dominic, can you explain something to me? You slept with her 'just once' a year ago, so why is she now eight months pregnant?""  
  
""Has there been some new medical breakthrough suggesting that egg fertilization can be delayed by two to four months?""  
  
""Enough!""  
  
Faced with my questioning, Dominic's expression darkened.  
  
""I'll explain everything later.""  
  
""Where's Austin? Why didn't you bring him home? It's just diarrhea—does he really need to stay in the hospital this long?""  
  
Hearing the name of my son, my heart felt like it was being pounded by a thousand hammers.  
  
I pulled out the folded death certificate and divorce agreement from my bag, collapsing by the entrance, my face empty of all hope.  
  
""Cremation in three days.""  
  
""Find some time to see him with me, and let's finalize the divorce by the way.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Taking the certificate and agreement, Dominic's scrutinizing gaze fell on me.  
  
Suddenly, he actually let out a laugh.  
  
""What convenient timing.""  
  
He released his grip, letting the papers fall at my feet.  
  
""Sorry, I didn't realize diarrhea could be fatal.""  
  
""I know you're upset, but it's fine. Dahlia is due to give birth in three days.""  
  
""It was just a sponsorship situation. She's very sensible and grateful. We've already agreed that after the baby is born, we'll bring it to you to raise. You can continue being Mrs. Reid without worry. There's just one condition—you need to allow Dahlia to visit the child regularly.""  
  
I froze, turning my head to look at him in disbelief.  
  
""Dominic! How can you say something like that? Are you some kind of monster?!""  
  
Dominic shot me a glance, his eyes filled with anger and blame.  
  
""Keep it down! Dahlia's taking a nap in the bedroom.""  
  
I couldn't believe they had become this shameless.  
  
SLAP!  
  
My hand connected hard with Dominic's face. As his head snapped to the side from the impact, he coldly said:  
  
""Feel better now?""  
  
""Don't make jokes like that again. Who dies from diarrhea? Making such jokes around Austin—aren't you worried he'll pick up your bad habits?""  
  
So he didn't believe the death certificate was real.  
  
A wave of exhaustion washed over me. I picked up the divorce agreement, walked to the coffee table, and meticulously signed my name.  
  
Tucking away the death certificate, I reminded Dominic, ""Don't forget to sign it.""  
  
Dominic was about to say something when his peripheral vision caught something that instantly dispelled his frustration.  
  
""You're awake?""  
  
Dahlia emerged from the master bedroom, the straps of her silk nightgown hanging loosely from her shoulders, exposing a series of glaring red marks across her collarbone.  
  
""Dominic, were you arguing with Lyra?""  
  
She dramatically picked up the agreement, her almond eyes filled with distress.  
  
""Lyra, you want to divorce Dominic?!""  
  
""Why? Is it because of me?""  
  
I looked at her with a derisive laugh. ""Yes, because you shamelessly got pregnant by another woman's husband, and because he's living a double life!""  
  
Tears instantly welled in Dahlia's eyes as she awkwardly tried to cover the marks on her collarbone.  
  
""I'm sorry, Lyra. I... I didn't realize opening the door that night would cause such a misunderstanding... I thought Dominic just came to talk about his troubles.""  
  
I found it laughable.  
  
What troubles would make a man abandon his wife on their wedding anniversary to confide in an outsider?  
  
Dominic grabbed a jacket and thoughtfully draped it over Dahlia's shoulders, not forgetting to comfort her, ""Don't mind her. She lost her mind today.""  
  
I didn't want to waste any more time with them. Ignoring the challenge in Dahlia's eyes, I went into the children's room to gather Austin's belongings.  
  
When I came back out, only Dahlia remained in the living room. She crumpled the paper in her hand and threw it at my feet.  
  
I immediately recognized it as my son's death certificate.  
  
""Who gave you permission to go through my things?"" I glared at her coldly.  
  
She exaggeratedly widened her mouth, her eyes gleaming with joy.  
  
""Lyra, your son really did die from diarrhea? Huh, that's so absurd! Dominic was right—weak children are so difficult to raise.""  
  
Shaking with rage, I didn't think twice before taking three quick strides toward her and slapping her hard across the face.  
  
She let out a shrill scream and fell backward onto the floor.  
  
The next moment, two vicious slaps landed on my face and head.  
  
Dominic gathered Dahlia in his arms, his eyes filled with murderous intent as he looked at me.  
  
""Lyra, you've gone too far!""  
  
Dahlia weakly leaned against his chest, crying uncontrollably. ""I was just asking about Austin's condition, and Lyra just... I only suggested that she shouldn't raise children to be so fragile, or lie about her child. Dominic, did I say something wrong?""  
  
Dominic shook his head.  
  
""Lyra, which part of what Dahlia said was wrong? What have you become? This is the second time you've hit her. If it happens again, we're really getting divorced!""  
  
With that, he carried the pale-faced Dahlia out the door.  
  
Not wanting to engage with them any further, I deliberately waited 15 minutes before taking my packed luggage downstairs.  
  
Dominic seems to have forgotten.  
  
I'm a gentle person by nature. As long as my boundaries aren't crossed, I never make things difficult for others, let alone resort to violence.  
  
That rare collection from the auction was actually my wedding gift—he had traveled France six years ago specifically to have it custom-made for me by a renowned designer.  
  
Not just Dominic, but everyone seems to have forgotten that the Reid and Winter families had always supported each other.  
  
Unfortunately, after a plane crash, the Winter family gradually became an empty shell.  
  
This jewelry set was what Dominic swore over my parents' graves to give me—promising to love me as they did, to provide me with the best and most perfect of everything.  
  
But six years later, he'd forgotten to pay the final installment for the set. When the deadline passed, the designer had no choice but to put it up for auction.  
  
I only wanted to reclaim what was rightfully mine, but Dominic froze my cards, and because of that, Austin had no medicine...

* **Photography:** I love capturing moments and a bit of the world around me. You can get a feel for my style over on my Flickr:[https://www.flickr.com/photos/piersmathias/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/piersmathias/)
* **Reading:** I'm a big fan of history, and I'm currently making my way through ""Revolutionary Spring"" by Christopher Clark. It's a fascinating look at 1848 in Europe. Always up for book recommendations or a good discussion.

Beyond that, I enjoy exploring London's never-ending offerings, decent coffee, and good conversation.

Looking to connect with friendly, interesting people for chats, maybe a coffee or a walk, and see where things go. Whether you share some of these interests or have completely different ones you're passionate about, I'm open to hearing from you.

All you need to do is keep being Mrs. Reid. Just one thing though—Dahlia needs to be able to visit the kid whenever she wants. Don't bother,"" I replied with a.........","Chapter 1  
My billionaire husband spends millions on sponsored a college girl's art exhibition, but refuses to pay $2,000 for our son's medical treatment. After my son died from severe diarrhea and dehydration right before my eyes, completely shattered, I handed my husband divorce papers. When Dominic saw the death certificate attached to the agreement, he actually couldn't hold back a laugh:  
""Sorry, I just had no idea someone could actually die from diarrhea. I know you're upset, but don't worry. Dahlia's having the baby in three days. She's such a thoughtful, grateful girl. We already worked it all out—once her baby's born, we'll hand it over to you. All you need to do is keep being Mrs. Reid. Just one thing though—Dahlia needs to be able to visit the kid whenever she wants. Don't bother,"" I replied with a bitter smile. Let's just divorce. When my attempts to get money from Dominic failed, I sold the ridiculously expensive engagement ring he'd once had custom-made—for a fraction of its worth. Rushing back to the hospital with what little cash I had, I heard the ominous beeping of machines echoing down the long corridor toward my son's room.  
  
Then, in seconds, the world fell into a suffocating silence, as if someone had hit pause on reality itself.  
  
""I'm so sorry, Mrs. Winters...""  
  
""To be honest... If you'd been able to pay for the medication just a few days earlier, your child would have been fine.""  
  
""Hospital policy is very clear—we cannot provide medication when payment hasn't been processed. I'm truly sorry, Mrs. Winters. We truly did everything we could... Please accept our deepest condolences.""  
  
I opened my mouth, but my throat felt like it was stuffed with razor blades wrapped in cotton—choking and painful—making it impossible to form a single coherent sound.  
  
Dragging my leaden legs to the bedside, I couldn't comprehend how to face my son's death.  
  
Just this morning, he had managed to summon a smile and call me ""Mommy"" from that same hospital bed.  
  
The TV mounted on the stark white wall flickered momentarily before regaining signal. Dominic's face appeared on screen.  
  
There he was, smiling—the man known for his cold public demeanor now standing warmly behind Dahlia, the college poor girl he ""sponsored,"" graciously greeting every gallery visitor with uncharacteristic charm.  
  
Some bold attendee, completely unafraid of the cameras and social media livestreams, openly speculated about their relationship:  
  
""With my years of experience reading people, I suspect there's more between Mr. Reid and our talented Miss Hayes than just a sponsorship arrangement.""  
  
""Come on, tell us! Are wedding bells in your future?""  
  
Hearing this, Dahlia blushed amid the teasing remarks, her eyes continuously seeking Dominic's, filled with unmistakable love and shy affection.  
  
""But isn't Mr. Reid married? His son is five years old. Have they divorced quietly without announcing it?""  
  
A brief, uncomfortable silence fell over the crowd. The person who asked quickly retreated into the crowd, suddenly fearful.  
  
Dahlia's eyes instantly welled up with embarrassment on camera. She turned to Dominic hesitantly:  
  
""Master, why didn't your wife come to the exhibition? Is she still upset about what happened at the auction? Perhaps I should visit her again and apologize properly.""  
  
Without a moment's hesitation, Dominic rejected the idea.  
  
""No need.""  
  
""I've spoiled her into becoming too petty. Imagine making such a fuss over a mere set of jewelry—even striking you over it. Since she's become so materialistic, I've decided not to give her another cent. I can't let that slap you received go unanswered.""  
  
""Seeing her take out her frustrations on you infuriates me.""  
  
His protective tone convinced everyone that our marriage was indeed falling apart, and somehow I had become the villain responsible for its demise.  
  
""Mrs. Reid must be incredibly petty and calculating. Dealing with someone like that would drain anyone's soul. No wonder Mr. Reid found comfort elsewhere.""  
  
""Let's set that aside for a moment—what about their child? If they really divorce and Mr. Reid continues with Miss Hayes, she'll eventually become a stepmother. Being a stepmother in a wealthy family is no easy role.""  
  
Seeing these, my heart felt like it was being repeatedly dropped into boiling oil, sizzling and burning a thousand times over.  
  
I couldn't distinguish whether my chest contained more grief or rage.  
  
The hospital room's air conditioning was set painfully low. Countless cold drafts penetrated my body, making me shiver violently. I couldn't help but turn to the family beside the neighboring bed:  
  
""Could you please turn up the temperature? My little boy has severe diarrhea and can't afford to get any colder.""  
  
I don't know how much time passed, but that cold still burrowed into my heart. I looked up impatiently, only to meet the nurse's horrified expression.  
  
""Mrs. Winters... family members aren't normally allowed to stay in the morgue for more than fifteen minutes. You've been here half the afternoon. Please, you need to leave now. The director is waiting for you to sign the death certificate.""  
  
""And the child's father—he's never once appeared. Now that the child is gone, surely he should show his face? Please contact him immediately.""  
  
My mind suddenly exploded with clarity.  
  
I finally returned to reality, stumbling to my feet as I made my way toward the door.  
  
**Chapter 2**  
  
The death certificate process moved quickly.  
  
Within two hours, I stood near an air vent, my hands shaking as I called the funeral home.  
  
Afterward, I called Dominic more than thirty times. Predictably, he never answered.  
  
Leaning against the cold tile wall, I laughed bitterly at myself.  
  
The funeral home staff collected my son's body before the hospital director finished his shift. Throughout the journey, I lost consciousness from crying countless times.  
  
At the funeral home, they immediately placed my son in cold storage, then gently advised me that I could bring his favorite clothes for him to wear—To leave this world clean and neat.  
  
Of course.  
  
My son, just like Dominic, was always fastidious about cleanliness.  
  
""Typically, cremation occurs within 72 hours of arrival at the funeral home. However, if family members request it, we can extend this period—3 days, 5 days, or 7 days. Do you have a preference?""  
  
I reached out to touch my son's face, now devoid of warmth.  
  
""3 days will be fine.""  
  
...  
  
I returned home in a daze well after midnight.  
  
When Dominic saw me, the smile in his eyes instantly disappeared.  
  
""Why are you back so late? Is Austin feeling better? Dahlia heard he's been having diarrhea and has been worried sick. She specifically asked me to bring home two boxes of medicine for him.""  
  
I dodged the medicine he held out, noticing the date on the package. A cold smile crossed my face as tears streamed down uncontrollably.  
  
""Expired medication? Who is she trying to kill?""  
  
Dominic's expression froze. He turned the box to see the manufacturing date, then his face flashed with irritation.  
  
""Dahlia simply didn't notice, that's all. Can't you speak without these constant jabs? You know pregnant women need to be super careful with medication. She probably had to travel all the way across town just to get those few pills. Besides, she's just a girl in her twenties—how is she supposed to know all that stuff?""""  
  
""And why didn't you attend Dahlia's art exhibition today? I told you days ago how important this event was, yet you deliberately chose to be difficult on this specific day?""  
  
He instinctively criticized me to defend Dahlia. Somehow, he had become blind to my red, swollen eyes.  
  
""Do you remember why you started sponsoring Dahlia in the first place?""  
  
Dominic stiffened, swallowing whatever criticism he was about to deliver.  
  
""You've forgotten, haven't you?""  
  
""Do you recall when your relationship with her crossed the line?""  
  
I looked at him calmly. ""Do you remember what you said to me after I discovered your one-night indiscretion?""  
  
A heavy silence filled the living room. The faint scent of rock rose in the air pulled both Dominic and me back to the past.  
  
Dahlia was a college student Dominic had brought back from a remote area during a business trip two years ago. At that time, she was bitter about her fate because her family wanted to marry her off to the village chief's son.  
  
She cried about her difficult educational journey and accused her parents of favoritism. Her determined expression moved Dominic.  
  
So, the billionaire CEO decided to sponsor her education, bringing her back and enrolling her in a prestigious university not far from our home.  
  
He bought her an apartment, provided her with a luxury car, and even gave her a black card for spending money.  
  
Gradually, Dominic grew closer to her and more distant from me. Even our son ceased to matter to him.  
  
Finally, one night when he was working late, Dominic went to the wrong home.  
  
When I discovered them, he knelt on the ground, repeatedly grabbing my hand to slap his own face.  
  
""I'm sorry, Lyra. It's my fault. I drank too much at the business dinner. She was forced by me...""  
  
""I promise it's just this once. I won't see her again after this, and once she graduates, I'll stop sponsoring her.""  
  
Then, Dahlia became pregnant.  
  
Thinking of this, a mocking smile twisted my lips.  
  
""Dominic, can you explain something to me? You slept with her 'just once' a year ago, so why is she now eight months pregnant?""  
  
""Has there been some new medical breakthrough suggesting that egg fertilization can be delayed by two to four months?""  
  
""Enough!""  
  
Faced with my questioning, Dominic's expression darkened.  
  
""I'll explain everything later.""  
  
""Where's Austin? Why didn't you bring him home? It's just diarrhea—does he really need to stay in the hospital this long?""  
  
Hearing the name of my son, my heart felt like it was being pounded by a thousand hammers.  
  
I pulled out the folded death certificate and divorce agreement from my bag, collapsing by the entrance, my face empty of all hope.  
  
""Cremation in three days.""  
  
""Find some time to see him with me, and let's finalize the divorce by the way.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Taking the certificate and agreement, Dominic's scrutinizing gaze fell on me.  
  
Suddenly, he actually let out a laugh.  
  
""What convenient timing.""  
  
He released his grip, letting the papers fall at my feet.  
  
""Sorry, I didn't realize diarrhea could be fatal.""  
  
""I know you're upset, but it's fine. Dahlia is due to give birth in three days.""  
  
""It was just a sponsorship situation. She's very sensible and grateful. We've already agreed that after the baby is born, we'll bring it to you to raise. You can continue being Mrs. Reid without worry. There's just one condition—you need to allow Dahlia to visit the child regularly.""  
  
I froze, turning my head to look at him in disbelief.  
  
""Dominic! How can you say something like that? Are you some kind of monster?!""  
  
Dominic shot me a glance, his eyes filled with anger and blame.  
  
""Keep it down! Dahlia's taking a nap in the bedroom.""  
  
I couldn't believe they had become this shameless.  
  
SLAP!  
  
My hand connected hard with Dominic's face. As his head snapped to the side from the impact, he coldly said:  
  
""Feel better now?""  
  
""Don't make jokes like that again. Who dies from diarrhea? Making such jokes around Austin—aren't you worried he'll pick up your bad habits?""  
  
So he didn't believe the death certificate was real.  
  
A wave of exhaustion washed over me. I picked up the divorce agreement, walked to the coffee table, and meticulously signed my name.  
  
Tucking away the death certificate, I reminded Dominic, ""Don't forget to sign it.""  
  
Dominic was about to say something when his peripheral vision caught something that instantly dispelled his frustration.  
  
""You're awake?""  
  
Dahlia emerged from the master bedroom, the straps of her silk nightgown hanging loosely from her shoulders, exposing a series of glaring red marks across her collarbone.  
  
""Dominic, were you arguing with Lyra?""  
  
She dramatically picked up the agreement, her almond eyes filled with distress.  
  
""Lyra, you want to divorce Dominic?!""  
  
""Why? Is it because of me?""  
  
I looked at her with a derisive laugh. ""Yes, because you shamelessly got pregnant by another woman's husband, and because he's living a double life!""  
  
Tears instantly welled in Dahlia's eyes as she awkwardly tried to cover the marks on her collarbone.  
  
""I'm sorry, Lyra. I... I didn't realize opening the door that night would cause such a misunderstanding... I thought Dominic just came to talk about his troubles.""  
  
I found it laughable.  
  
What troubles would make a man abandon his wife on their wedding anniversary to confide in an outsider?  
  
Dominic grabbed a jacket and thoughtfully draped it over Dahlia's shoulders, not forgetting to comfort her, ""Don't mind her. She lost her mind today.""  
  
I didn't want to waste any more time with them. Ignoring the challenge in Dahlia's eyes, I went into the children's room to gather Austin's belongings.  
  
When I came back out, only Dahlia remained in the living room. She crumpled the paper in her hand and threw it at my feet.  
  
I immediately recognized it as my son's death certificate.  
  
""Who gave you permission to go through my things?"" I glared at her coldly.  
  
She exaggeratedly widened her mouth, her eyes gleaming with joy.  
  
""Lyra, your son really did die from diarrhea? Huh, that's so absurd! Dominic was right—weak children are so difficult to raise.""  
  
Shaking with rage, I didn't think twice before taking three quick strides toward her and slapping her hard across the face.  
  
She let out a shrill scream and fell backward onto the floor.  
  
The next moment, two vicious slaps landed on my face and head.  
  
Dominic gathered Dahlia in his arms, his eyes filled with murderous intent as he looked at me.  
  
""Lyra, you've gone too far!""  
  
Dahlia weakly leaned against his chest, crying uncontrollably. ""I was just asking about Austin's condition, and Lyra just... I only suggested that she shouldn't raise children to be so fragile, or lie about her child. Dominic, did I say something wrong?""  
  
Dominic shook his head.  
  
""Lyra, which part of what Dahlia said was wrong? What have you become? This is the second time you've hit her. If it happens again, we're really getting divorced!""  
  
With that, he carried the pale-faced Dahlia out the door.  
  
Not wanting to engage with them any further, I deliberately waited 15 minutes before taking my packed luggage downstairs.  
  
Dominic seems to have forgotten.  
  
I'm a gentle person by nature. As long as my boundaries aren't crossed, I never make things difficult for others, let alone resort to violence.  
  
That rare collection from the auction was actually my wedding gift—he had traveled France six years ago specifically to have it custom-made for me by a renowned designer.  
  
Not just Dominic, but everyone seems to have forgotten that the Reid and Winter families had always supported each other.  
  
Unfortunately, after a plane crash, the Winter family gradually became an empty shell.  
  
This jewelry set was what Dominic swore over my parents' graves to give me—promising to love me as they did, to provide me with the best and most perfect of everything.

Like locally roasted coffee, local beer/wine, etc.

But! I would also like to provide a gift card to the brewery / pub I work for (which I get at a discounted rate so it works out that the value exceeds the cost on my end). 

The brewery is highly known in the area and I would speculate most visiting would go there anyways if they’re into that stuff. We offer NonAlc options too.

Sitters - is this too much/off putting? Like am I trying too hard? Would you welcome a $20 gift card? Can be used for drinks, merch, beer to go, or dinner/apps at our pub. So even if you don’t drink, there are things to use it for! Is $20 not enough…?

Or would you prob not have time and think of it as unnecessary?

I am NOT asking for more in exchange. THS is still providing me more value with these sits for my two dogs regardless of my “gifts”. 

My sits I have currently booked range from 4 days to nearly 3 weeks.

For some context: I usually clean my house every other day, and have nothing exposed (no open food, fruits, or any plants at all). I only have my brita filter but that seems clean. Take out the trash immediately after cooking etc. (used to only do it every night but this has given me paranoia).

I'm in a long-distance relationship and last August I met my girlfriend in-person for the first time. We attended a friend's wedding in Germany (neither of us live there). Her flight home was several hours before mine so I went with her to the airport to see her off and then had to hang around Frankfurt airport for the guts of an entire day waiting for my own flight.

Needless to say I was more than a bit upset (edit: because I missed my gf, not because I had to hang around the airport lol). My time was spent alternating between reading and heading out for a smoke and a cry. At one point I decided it's probably a good idea to have someone there to give me a hug when I land so I called up my wonderful mother to ask if she could be there when my plane arrives. Trying to talk on the phone really set me off. After I hung up the phone I just started sobbing.

Random lady with her two kids sat across from me noticed. She asked if I was ok, which I answered no, not really. She asked if she could get me a coffee or a cake from the café and I said I'd be fine, just gonna try to distract myself with my book. She told me if I wanted to talk about it she'd listen. Her simply showing care and concern for me, someone she didn't know at all, was a huge help already. Especially since, as a man, I'm used to being ridiculed for showing vulnerability like that.

After a little bit she said she had to go coz her flight was soon. I thanked her again for her kindness. It really made a world of difference to my shitty day. But this wonderful woman wasn't done yet. Despite her having to wrangle two kids for a flight that was boarding soon, she returned a few minutes later with a Twix and a small bag of M&Ms for me. Said ""I know it won't fix whatever's wrong but hopefully it helps."" I thanked her again before she left.

I know it's not the biggest gesture in the world but the fact that she went out of her way to be so kind to me really meant so much. I wanted to share the story here so others know of this lovely person and her care for some random dude who was crying in the airport.",55,1751046149.0,randomactsofkindness,8,0.98,False

I really think we vibe and for the past month that weve been talking, nothing fills me up with life like pag kausap kita. Random tidbits of our convos, play in my head while Im on the road. And alam ko may tama na ako sayo kasi, I think of you at random points of the day. I listen to your music all the time.

I think we're a bit too old to be indirect, yet we're a little bit too old to push this fast. Nahihiya lang ako sayo, pero I think it would be a dream to go hang out with you, stare out the window of a random coffee shop while it rains.

I know were both in the same boat, healing from our pasts, kaya ayoko magmadali. Ayoko din pangunahan sarili ko, pero I really think we connect, and I hope you find it the same way too.

Alam ko busy ka with your pursuits right now, but I hope when its a little bit less hectic, we can go spend a day together.

I really like you.

(24F),"I’ve had a really rough go with friendships since college ended. My friend group from college all stayed friends, but slowly eliminated me from their plans. There was no big fight or anything and I didn’t live far from them. I guess they just forgot about me.

When I noticed I was being “phased out” (not invited to parties, nights out, etc.), I tried really hard to hold on to individual friendships within the group. I would invite people out to dinner, drinks, coffee, movie nights at my place, free city events, etc. and they’d usually decline. When we actually would go, we’d have a good time and then I don’t hear from them again. Sometimes they’d give me excuses that don’t make sense. For example, a couple of months ago, one of my best friends told me he didn’t want to meet for drinks because he wanted to save money. I invited him to hang out at my house instead, and he told me he’d rather go to the movies with another friend… which is just as much as the drinks in the first place.

At one point, I confronted one of them about whether she’d be coming to my holiday party (which no one ended up showing up to). She said she bought tickets to a bar’s big holiday party that night, but “you’re welcome to come!” The only problem is it was a ticketed event and she only told me after it sold out… then posted photos from it with all of our other friends while I sat home with no one at my party…

I guess I’m just feeling hopeless and embarrassed. I can’t believe I’m in my mid-20s and dealing with middle school level friend group issues. It’s just hard when you’re having a bad day, or have exciting news, or just want to talk to someone, and then realize you have no one.

I ended up moving out of that city this month (not that any of them cared — they knew I was moving from social media and despite years of “friendship,” not a single person reached out to meet for coffee or even say goodbye). I’m trying to stay open minded about my new city, but I almost feel traumatized by all of it. I don’t want to get close to people again because I don’t want to risk getting hurt. I want to give new people a chance without assuming it will go sour, but it’s hard.

We’re not really drawn to big cities or fast-paced life — we’re looking for a slower rhythm, somewhere we can settle in and feel part of a close-knit community. A town where we can walk to coffee shops, support local businesses, and spend time outdoors.

When we visited Brevard, NC, we instantly connected with the atmosphere. Friendly people, beautiful surroundings, and a grounded energy. But with limited job and housing opportunities there, we’ve decided to keep searching.

What we hope to find is a small town (ideally under 50k people), with easy access to nature — parks, hiking, trails, etc. We’d love a walkable downtown, affordable rent (around or under $1,500 for a one-bedroom), and a space that feels welcoming to young people like us who care more about connection and calm than nightlife.

We both plan to work in coffee (and yes we know it doesnt pay a lot, and thats totally fine with us), so towns with a few good local spots are a huge plus. Natural markets, a laid-back vibe, and even a little winter are totally fine, just not freezing and feet of snow. And while not a requirement, 420-friendly is a bonus.

We’re open to any location — mountains, coast, or somewhere in between — as long as it feels peaceful, intentional, and community-focused.

If you’ve been somewhere that sounds like this or know a hidden gem worth looking into, I’d love to hear from you. Thanks so much for reading!",2,1751045932.0,relocating,4,1.0,False

I spent a good amount of time looking at different options, testing them out, and reading up on reviews. The best one to come out of all that research is the [MuellerLiving French Press](https://econsumerproductreviews.com/dp-B07JGBK6XV). The 34oz size is perfect for making a decent amount of coffee without being too bulky, and the double insulation keeps your coffee hot for a good while. One of the things I like is how versatile it is—not just for coffee, but you can also use it for tea or hot chocolate if you're in the mood for something different.
The design is pretty straightforward, and the 4-level filtration system makes sure that your coffee doesn’t have a bunch of grounds floating around. It’s also super easy to clean, which is a huge plus, especially if you're not into spending too much time maintaining it.
I did look into a few other options like the Bodum or Secura French presses. The Bodum is great, but it’s kinda fragile, and Secura’s good for durability but doesn’t have the same insulation, so your coffee cools off faster. So it’s a bit of a trade-off.

(something the shape of the last two images). And to replace the oversized chair with something smaller so the space doesn't feel cramped.

I save regular Saturday mornings for running routine errands with my husband. We go out and get a coffee from the small coffee shop we like to support and then pick up fresh baguette from the bakery and some macaroni or potato salad for lunch from the vegan butcher. Then we grab a bag of loose tea (and sometimes we grab something freshly brewed!) from the small tea shop. It's part of our regular food shop for the week and we like to support those small businesses. If we have stuff to drop off or pick up from the library or post office, we'll stop there too. Other food/household stuff as needed - farmer's markets, local pharmacies, or Aldi usually.

End of the month can be a bit more and that's what I spent some time this morning looking at. I have a few things to donate so we'll stop and do that. I keep a large LL Bean canvas tote in the coat closet and we all just toss stuff in over the month and donate it all at the end. I've got to stop in at the post office and send out a bunch of paintings to FLAGs across the country, and I have some books to put in the closest Little Free Library. I need a new kitchen sponge and a couple of toilet cleaning tabs so I'll stop in at the refillery, too. 

I think we'll take our freshly brewed iced tea from the shop, and our macaroni salad, down to the beach tomorrow. When we get back, we're flipping the mattress, oiling the cutting board and wooden spoons, and scanning any documents in the basket that have been collecting there all month.

I have about $20k in federal student loans and $55k in private student loans from a degree I finish in December 2017. Since then, when I've been able to work, I've managed to pay over $30k towards them and the balance has only gone up in that time, largely because I have never been able to sustain full time work. I received an autism diagnosis in 2020, which put my whole life into perspective and gave me context for why I struggled so much to keep work. At this point in my life, I can barely manage to work at all. I do so sporadically as I am able. 

In Fall 2024, I reached out to a legal aid organization about possibly suing my private lender for predatory lending. They didn't feel there was a worthwhile case, but informed me of disability discharge (I had never heard of it before this time). Mercifully, my private lender does offer disability discharge. After much research and ruminating, I went to my primary care doctor and she completed the paperwork for me and I am submitting my applications today. 

There is, of course, no guarantee that either the federal or private lenders will grant me discharge, so I'm hoping to do a medium sized spell to give the process a little boost, and maybe a small, very low effort daily action I could take during the time that the applications are being reviewed (for example, I pour my ancestors coffee every morning, that's the kind of daily spiritual activity I've been able to maintain). 

Furthermore, I do have co-signers on my private loans. My private lender is ***very*** scattered and disorganized based on my interactions with them. This may be a stretch but I'd love to maybe do something to encourage their forgetfulness/disorganization enough to result in my co-signers being released as well.

Finally, the discharge would be backdated to the onset of my disability. I assume this means my previous payments would be returned if the discharge is backdated. Technically speaking, autism is a lifelong condition, but my diagnosis date is July 2020. My doctor listed April 2025 as when I became unable to work, I think mostly because I left that blank and that was when I submitted the request to her to complete the paperwork. Absolute stretch goal would be if they did in fact backdate it to my diagnosis date and I was able to receive somewhat of a refund, as things have been very difficult financially the past two years (I haven't worked significantly in two full years and my husband has been on UI since March of this year).

We've been married for 16 years ( and we have our American citizenship this is important later) and have two kids, 15 and 12.  When my oldest started school, she had trouble making friends, so I diced to star talking with some moms and make plans to have play dates. This is the moment when we meet the ""Miller's "" ( fake last name) it was a family of 5. We all started to get-together every weekend, birthday parties Thanksgiving etc etc. We were friends for 8 long years. One day Mr Miller came to our house by himself and he started telling us about they are getting divorced. We listened and we offered our help, next day Mrs Miller call me and invite me to get a coffee, also she started to tell me the same history but with a little bit differences, any way we offered our help same as Mr Miller and we let them clear that we are not choosing sides. And that is the moment when our ""Friendship"" goes down the hill. They separated for 1 o 2 months then they get together, but they send us to Gostland,no calls no text nothing, they trying to avoid us at parties, etc. It was like that for 8 months until Mrs Miller called me and ask for be part on her daughter sixteen, she said that she totally forgot to tell us about this, and she wants us to be godparents for her daughter wich means that we have to give her a necklace. Honestly I  was really hurt about how they been acting with us and I told my husband that I don't want to be part of this (by the way they sexteen it was a week after she called)  But my husband and my daughter insisted, so we accepted. 
After that Party we just see them one more time at New years, but on my opinion it wasn't the same, we didn't call or text nothing. I want to mention that I'm really hurt by this, but I wasn't expected it will be worse. Lats week my husband and I invite our neighbors for dinner we were drinking and having a conversation when at some point the Miller's came out into our conversation. And my Husband bring his theory... which is that the Miller's in all those yearsthey try to separate us and then each of us marry them so that they would obtain their citizenship. I don't know but something in me CLICK, and I told him that this isn't the first time that he said that an to me it was like...Wait a minue,  What is happening! So I ask him if if she (Mrs. Miller) do something or said something to him, and he got quiet for a few seconds and then he told me or at least try to told me that Mr. MILLER sometimes he looked at me... I dont let him finish, and I said No you are not going to turn this in to me, because I didn't even think on that. As you can imagine things turn heated and ended up that conversation with what ever it was I don't want Mrs or Mr Miller at my house ever again! Because for what we are been seeing they are separeted again. 
That night my head was a mess trying to remember thinks that I maybe don't see at that time amd started to remember a few things. But something still doesn't match why ? Because that week my husband was pushing me to call Mrs Miller and invite her to our dinner, I said yes, I'll  call her but I didn't. And then he came whit his theory and the silence and the face wjen I ask him was enough for me to bring my Sherlock Holmes side. As soon as he falls asleep I took hes phone and look the fb massages it wasn't in the first page but when I type her name it came up. He send her a picture of her (nothing sexy o provocative) and ask her about Mr Miller and and what was happening between them. Also say o we can do a barbecue next weekend and talk about it. She answered sure why not I have a lot to said. And that was it. 
I took pictures of the conversation with my phone and put the phone back. 
Next day we didn't mention anything about the conversation and I barely talked to him. He was calm but I can see that he knew there was a problem. 2 days after I call my besty and I told her what happened she told me to keep calm that maybe it was a misunderstanding or something, so I  try to calm myself.  But that night I check his phone again and SURPRISE! THAT CONVERSATION WAS DELETED , EVERYTHING WAS DELETED! 
 So here I'm asking all of you if AIO for don'tlet my husband invite this person to our house?
Also I want to confront him but not sure if I should. TIA for your time and I'm sorry if this is to long or it doesn't make sense but English is my 2nd language.

At morning I have to drink 4 or 5 mega cups of coffee and still can't to anything. I wasn't like this like even 1 year ago, it began 2 years ago.

My family really can't stand me and, to be honest, knowing that originally I wasn't like this I repeat even 1 year ago, I also kinda ""lost my mind"" in the way I communicate (especially in the morning)... I'm ridiculous and especially more fragile compared to 2 years ago. I changed as a person and I'm sure it's due to this UARS or whatever it is!

My family tells that I wanted this situation, I ""asked for it"" since I'm not useful, dont study, as i used to, dont work. I had problems with time in the past and think i was different maybe due to this UARS, which aggressively appeared these 2 years. I won't talk about the way my doc (I'm changing him) treated this, just to say, he made fun of me as I was trying to understand my issue. That piece of ****. Sorry for the rant, returning to my courtly language.

Please, tell me if someone had this: in the last months I had 2 panick attacks, the 1rst one's effects (like anxiety.. but idk if that was panick attack) lasted 2  weeks). 2 months of bad ulcer, treated it but I feel it a bit lasting. 2 weeks ago fever and nausea and the effects of the nausea still lasting. BTW, I do have memory problems with thing I was told even some hours before, never had this.

This ""storm"" never happened in my life.

I have a healthy life.. well, destroyed by this potential UARS. Maybe my body has not an immune system as before due to this. Does anyone know if there is a correlation between these illnesses in these recent times and the worsening of my sleep issue?

Took my first shot on Sunday at 1:30PM. I am OOP from Lilly Direct, so I opted for the vials. I have a history of gastrointestinal issues and I was pretty nervous and had to work myself up to it. Here’s how the last 5 days have gone:

The shot itself was completely painless. I opted for my stomach and I didn’t even feel the needle go in. 

Sunday afternoon, I felt… loopy? I’m wondering if it was just adrenaline so we’ll see if it happens again after my 2nd shot. I also had dry mouth and a slight odd taste pretty quickly, which has tapered through out the week. 

Monday AM I had a pretty good headache, but I popped some Advil and almost 24 hours after my shot, I got a burst of energy. I did a bunch of outdoor chores then a 35 minute interval run. 

Tuesday I had a headache again, some mild nausea, and the sensation that my stomach was in my throat. This has been my primary symptom throughout the week.

Tuesday night & Wednesday night: Insomnia! No problem going to sleep, but wide awake at 3AM. The insomnia is the main reason I have not worked out again this week, but I have a script for hydroxyzine for occasional insomnia and will use it regularly going forward. 

Wednesday & Thursday - the great flush! I must have peed 137 times. I could FEEL the inflammation leaving my body. By Thursday afternoon I just felt… better. Lighter.

Friday (today) I decided to weigh in. Down 4 lbs! I remembered to take my sleep aid last night and I feel great today. No headache, stomach in throat sensation is mostly gone. Hoping to get a run in!

Based on my size and frame, my recommended food calorie budget is 1163. I have easily stayed in that range without any cravings. I am also learning that my cues are different now. Nausea, at least earlier in the week, meant I was hungry. I also tried to have my normal two cups of coffee Monday AM and learned that my body preferred just one. I keep Chimes ginger chews on hand and they are chewy little miracles! I get a 1lb pack on Amazon for around $8 and highly recommend them!

I don’t think I suffer from food noise (see “about me” below), but I did find myself feeling anxious about what I could/should eat. Figuring out dinner while being under slept and slightly nauseous was a little rough. I just need to jot down my meal plans for the week so I don’t have to think about it. That always helped me even before starting Zep. 

Finally, the 💩: Thankfully I have remained pretty regular, with exception to the great flush on Wednesday! 😅 I’m a vegetarian, so getting fiber is never a problem. 
I averaged around 74 grams of protein per day, which is good for my size. 

About Me: I have asthma, emergency full hysterectomy at 40, and Hashimotos. I also have a very small frame - my wedding ring is a size 4.5. I have struggled with my weight since junior year in HS. My highest was 187 after I had my daughter and was placed on a contraceptive that caused crazy weight gain.

# Chapter 1 My Wife Has Violent Tendencies

As the heavy door of Ashwood Mental Hospital creaked open, a pale, slender woman stepped out. She was Audrey Patel. She covered her aching stomach and dragged her feet to walk, while the murmurs behind her followed like shadows.

Someone whispered, ""Mr. Patel's such a saint. He still sticks with her after she went nuts and hurt others with a knife.""

Another person said bitterly, ""If my wife pulled a stunt like that, I'd kick her out the same day. She's a total disgrace to Mr. Patel.""

Someone else chimed in, ""If Ms. Patterson's father hadn't passed away, and she hadn't moved in with her uncle, she would've married Mr. Patel ages ago. Audrey would never have had the chance.""

Audrey squinted against the harsh light and gave a bitter little smile.

Everyone knew the story. She was an orphan girl from some no-name town who somehow married Clayton Patel, a big-shot lawyer with a spotless image. People all said she won the lottery.

But now, with a reputation for being violent and unstable, fired from her job and fresh out of a mental hospital, she looked even more out of place next to Clayton.

Audrey thought bitterly, 'They all think I don't deserve him. Funny thing is, the one who stuck me in that hellhole and slapped that label on me was my perfect husband himself.'

It was July. The sun blazed down, but Audrey felt chilly all over, especially her heart.

Ashwood had a glossy cover story—something about correcting troubled youth and improving their mental state. But what went on inside was a nightmare.

Audrey, a 23-year-old grown woman, had been locked in there for a month because her husband claimed she was a danger and needed to have her mind straightened out.

During the past month, she was punished, starved, locked in pitch-black isolation—until she cracked, until she agreed she was wrong and promised to change.

Now, standing outside, breathing free air again, she watched Clayton hang up a call. His handsome face twisted with irritation.

""Zoe's ran a bath for you. Let's go home and wash off the bad luck,"" Clayton said to Audrey.

Audrey dodged the hand he reached toward her shoulder.

Clayton was always well-groomed with tailored suits and expensive cologne. But today, he didn't smell like his usual scent. Instead, he reeked of something sickly sweet, like overripe fruit. That scent made Audrey sick.

Ignoring Clayton's grim face, Audrey pulled open the passenger-side door and got in.

The driver, who'd already opened the back door, glanced at Clayton in confusion.

Clayton watched her, his lips pressed tight. He thought she was clearly still sulking after a month of confinement. He figured she wasn't used to that kind of strict environment, so she threw a tantrum.

Though he had his reasons, he still went too far to send her in against her will. So, for now, he didn't blame her for her little temper.

He sat in the back seat. The driver closed the door and started the car.

Audrey turned to the window and closed her eyes. The whole thing a month ago appeared in her mind.

It was her birthday that day. Clayton brought home a special guest—his childhood friend, Valerie Patterson, and her three-year-old daughter, Luna Patterson.

While Clayton went to get the cake, Valerie grabbed a fruit knife and pressed it to her wrist, threatening to hurt herself if Audrey didn't give Clayton back to her.

Tears streamed down Valerie's face as she said she and Clayton were meant to be, that she came back to fix what they once lost.

Audrey lunged to stop Valerie and tried to snatch the knife just as Clayton walked in.

Valerie stumbled into Clayton's arms, sobbing like she'd just survived a war. ""Audrey, please don't hurt Luna. Clayton and I haven't done anything. You're getting it all wrong.""

Audrey stood frozen with the knife still in hand, her mind blanking out.

Valerie, still clinging to Clayton, glanced up at Audrey with a smug glint in her eyes. ""Clayton only let us move into your house 'cause we had nowhere else to go.

""I swear I'll pay back every penny he lent to us. Just don't scare my baby, okay? She's got autism.""

Clayton wrapped his arms around Valerie and Luna and shot a cold stare at Audrey. ""Valerie's hands are for painting. How could you hurt her?""

Little Luna, who watched the whole thing, just curled up tighter in Clayton's arms, shaking like a leaf.

Audrey let out a dry laugh, more from rage than amusement.

She thought to herself, 'So that's her game. She used my birthday party to air out her affair with Clayton. Either I suck it up and pretend my husband's got no side piece, or I pack my bags and quit the game.'

Audrey turned to Clayton, her voice firm. ""Believe it or not, she cut herself.""

""No way,"" Clayton shot back without missing a beat.

He was convinced no one knew Valerie's talent with a paintbrush better than he did. She would rather die than damage her hands. No chance she'd hurt herself just to frame Audrey.

Audrey scoffed and pointed straight at Valerie. ""Then tell me, why did you let them live in the house I bought and even gave them money? You're keeping her and her kid on the side, and I'm supposed to just be cool with it?""

Clayton's colleagues and a couple of his friends were right behind him. Being embarrassed like that in front of everyone clearly rattled him.

""My hand... Clayton, it hurts,"" Valerie whimpered, holding out her bleeding wrist, swaying like she was about to faint.

Guilt flashed across Clayton's face, but it was gone in a blink, replaced by anger. He barked at his assistant, ""My wife has violent tendencies. Send her to Ashwood Mental Hospital.""

Thinking back on it, Audrey put on a cold smile, sneering, 'To protect that woman's reputation, my husband threw me into that filthy place.'

Clayton must've caught that mocking look on her face, because for once, he tried to explain himself, ""I sent you to Ashwood to keep things from getting worse. You scared Luna.

""She had a fever for days. They've had a hard time. You shouldn't trash Valerie like that.""

Audrey opened her eyes, her gaze turning icy. ""I picked the house. I pay the mortgage. They're living in it and spending money from MY husband. Yeah, clearly I screwed up. I should've been more generous, huh?""

Clayton took a deep breath and said, ""Vally doesn't blame you. She's already dropped the charges. It won't affect you.""

Audrey sneered, thinking, 'Won't affect me? Due to my so-called violent tendencies you pinned on me, I lost my job three days after staying at Ashwood.'

Clayton and Valerie went way back. Years ago, both Valerie and Clayton's fathers got sick. Valerie's father gave up his shot at treatment and donated his kidney to save Clayton's father.

After that, Valerie and her mother moved out of town to live with her uncle. The night she turned up again, she was on the run. She was beaten by her husband, so she took her daughter to leave.

Clayton just happened to be on a business trip in that exact city. He swooped in like a hero, took on Valerie's divorce case, and brought her and her daughter back to Ironhaven.

\*\*\*\*\*

The car slowly rolled into Hightower Homes. Audrey didn't wait for it to stop but opened the door, got out, and headed straight for the elevator without a glance back.

She took a long shower and changed into clean clothes.

When she came out, Zoe was carrying dishes from the kitchen. She said with a smile, ""Dinner's almost ready, ma'am. Mr. Patel picked all your favorites.""

Clayton was on the couch going through some documents. He looked up over the rim of his gold-rimmed glasses and said, ""Dry your hair first. I'll wait to eat with you.""

Anyone walking in might've thought he was the picture of a devoted husband, setting aside legal briefs to dine with his wife.

But Audrey knew this was just his usual trick: slap you across the face and then hand you a candy.

Clayton took off his glasses and walked to the dining table. Pulling out a chair, he said, ""It's a bit late today. I'll have Zoe buy your favorite fish tomorrow.""

Audrey sat down without a word and picked up her fork.

Clayton was good at keeping his emotions locked up and hardly ever spoke more than necessary. Most of the time when they were together, Audrey always babbled him with some online gossip just to fill the silence.

Each time, Audrey would laugh out loud, yet Clayton was just calm and would sometimes give her a look to remind her of being composed.

Now, Audrey didn't even look at him. Worse, when he tried to serve her some food, she just picked it up and tossed it back onto the plate.

# Chapter 2 Don't Keep Pushing

Clayton tried to serve her more food, but Audrey stood up, dumped her utensils in the sink, and walked straight to the bedroom.

They had a nanny at home, but Audrey liked doing things herself. She used to cook Clayton's favorite meals and laid out his suits for the day. Zoe came in for an hour daily just to tidy up.

She used to think it was a sweet little routine between them, yet now, recalling what happened, Audrey felt like she was out of her mind in the past.

Clayton's mother, Lillian Patel, always thought Audrey was after Clayton's money. She made Clayton hand over half his paycheck every month for her to keep and said she'd return it when she was sure Audrey wasn't a gold digger.

Their finances had basically been split fifty-fifty since the wedding. And outsiders still loved gossiping about how Audrey married up, about her being some clingy, fame-hungry wannabe.

Audrey put up with all of it because she loved Clayton. But now? Now she couldn't believe how blind she used to be.

The husband she always felt proud of, the man who once stood for justice, fighting tooth and nail for unpaid factory workers, now threw his own wife under the bus to protect another woman's reputation.

Clayton's hand froze in the air, and he clearly felt the weight of her cold shoulder. He wiped his mouth with a napkin and knocked gently on the bedroom door. ""Audrey, I can explain that thing.""

From inside, Audrey let out a bitter laugh and thought, 'If you had anything to say, why didn't you say it a month ago in front of your coworkers, your friends, and in front of her? What's the act for now?'

She remembered that look in his eyes that night was nothing but irritation, and he said to her, ""You can leave Ashwood once you calm down.""

He even said, ""Vally and Luna have had it rough. If you're gonna make things worse for them, then maybe it's time you felt what being truly alone is like.""

He knew she was an orphan, and he always knew he was her only lifeline. But instead of standing by her, he sided with Valerie and crushed what little hope she had left.

When Valerie watched Audrey being dragged into Ashwood, she didn't even try to hide the satisfaction in her eyes. She smiled, as if saying, 'Say what you want, Clayton won't believe you. The more you fight it, the crazier you'll look.'

Audrey tried to break free from the nurses and scrambled back toward the hallway. With just one door between them, she heard Valerie sweet-talking Clayton, ""Clay, the doctor just said I can't draw anymore, but I can still have other jobs. Audrey only hurt me 'cause she loves you too much.""

Audrey didn't hear what Clayton replied because she was already forced into a room with bars on the windows.

She'd clenched her teeth and thought, 'If Clayton wants to play savior, he better chain himself to her for life. Just don't drag decent people down with them. I'm not interested in his lame excuse.'

Clearly thrown by Audrey's sudden silence, Clayton loosened his tie, feeling irritated without knowing why. He raised his voice to say, ""Why do you hate Vally so much? She's just a friend.""

Audrey didn't buy that for a second. She couldn't believe he still pretended not to know how Valerie felt for him.

After all, Valerie was jobless, divorced, and took her three-year-old daughter with autism back to Ironhaven and stepped into their life.

Audrey sneered inwardly, 'What kind of friend pushes others to divorce? What kind of friend throws herself into the arms of another woman's husband?'

If things kept going like this, Audrey knew she'd finally go crazy one day.

She suddenly flung the bedroom door open and sneered, ""Your family owes Valerie. That's your business, not mine. You want me to take care of your parents, but now I'm supposed to repay your debt too?""

She thought bitterly, 'Just because I married a superior and famous lawyer, I should play the good wife role? I didn't get any benefit from this marriage but got hurt mentally and physically.'

She looked him straight in the eye and said firmly, ""You were scared people would talk trash about her, so you told them I was violent and unstable. Her father saved your father, so you wanna sacrifice my reputation to protect her name?""

Her voice shook with rage. ""What right does she have to live in the house I bought and spend the money my husband gives her? What right do you have to send me to that darned mental hospital?""

Audrey had been holding her rage all in for too long, and now the dam burst. She let all her rage and her heartbreak out.

She hated Valerie for twisting the truth, but even more than that, she hated the man who once promised her a warm and safe home. She took a shaky breath, wiped her face, and realized her cheeks were wet with tears.

Clayton's expression turned more serious. He hadn't expected her to be this furious. Lowering his voice, he said, ""I know you lost your job, but I'll support you. Once Vally and Luna settle down, I'll hand over the rest of my paycheck to you.""

Audrey let out a long breath, feeling tired. She thought to herself, 'If I fall for his crap again, I'm the dumbest woman ever. You betrayed me once, and what makes you think I'll believe your promise again?'

She'd seen through him completely. Clayton's heart had already gone rotten. He'd always side with Valerie. This time, she was sent to Ashwood Mental Hospital. But she didn't know if she had a fight with Valerie again, what her heartless husband would do to her.

After all, she had no family. Clayton, as her legal guardian, had the power to do whatever he wanted.

Audrey looked at Clayton. Her eyes contained no more softness, no love, just a sheet of coldness.

She said, ""Don't bother dangling carrots in front of me. I got fired due to Valerie. You're gonna pay me 150,000 dollars. Then we get a divorce. You can play house with whoever you want after that.""

""I'm not divorcing you,"" Clayton shot back without hesitation.

Yanking off his tie, he flung it onto the couch. His chest felt tight, like he couldn't breathe. He thought, 'She wants a divorce over something so small? What the hell is wrong with her?'

The tie hit a decorative piece on the coffee table, knocking it to the floor. It shattered with a sharp crash, broken into pieces.

For once, the always-composed lawyer Clayton raised his voice. ""You lost your job, and I'll make it right. But divorce? Out of the question.""

He thought he'd already lowered himself enough. He was Clayton—the admired, respected, and untouchable top-tier lawyer. Now that he was trying to meet her halfway, Audrey should've known when to quit.

But Audrey's eyes were colder than ever. There was even disgust in them.

Clayton suddenly felt something slipping out of his grasp. He couldn't name it, but the feeling irritated him more than he cared to admit.

He muttered, ""It's all in the past. Can't we let it go?""

""Clay? Is Audrey back?"" Valerie's voice rang out as she walked in, decked out in a Chanel dress, a Coach bag on her arm, and a pair of shining high heels.

Valerie was five years older than Audrey, but she dressed younger and more fashionably. Audrey had always been practical—saving every cent to pay off the mortgage early, never splurging on luxury brands.

However, Valerie, a jobless single mother with a sick toddler, strolled in head-to-toe brands. It didn't take a genius to figure out who was footing the bill.

She stopped at the entryway, pretending to be shocked at the pieces on the floor. ""Audrey, if you've got a problem, take it out on me. My hand's ruined already. Go ahead and slash me again if it makes you feel better.

""That piece is a foreign art exhibit, you know? Clayton really likes it. It cost a few grand.""

Audrey let out a laugh that was anything but amused. ""Valerie, with that kind of imagination, you seriously missed your calling. You should be stalking celebs for gossip sites. I bought that piece, okay? How this involves you?""

Before Valerie could get a word in, Audrey turned to Clayton. ""You heard her, right? That thing's a foreign exhibit, cost 6,000 dollars. You broke it. You gotta pay.""

Valerie's eyes filled with tears instantly. She turned those helpless, wounded eyes toward Clayton. ""Clay, I thought you guys were arguing about me, so I—""

Clayton clenched his fists, feeling fed up. ""Vally's already forgiven you for what you did to her. You don't need to keep pushing.""

# Chapter 3 Clear The Mess

Valerie gently touched Clayton's arm and said, ""Clay, it's fine. I know Audrey hates me. I'll just leave now.""

But she didn't move a muscle. Instead, she looked up at Clayton with wide eyes, full of dependence and reluctance.

Clayton picked up the broken pieces and placed them on the coffee table. He was afraid Audrey might lose it again and end up hurting Valerie.

Clayton and Audrey got married just after they met each other. Back then, he was pissed at his family and randomly asked Audrey, who'd just dropped off a file at his law firm, if she'd marry him.

Audrey's reaction was unforgettable. She was first shocked, then pure joy. She told him she was an orphan, just landed a job at a foreign company, and didn't have much to offer compared to him. She promised she'd work hard, catch up to him, and be worthy.

Clayton made sure to sign a prenup, and the two of them got their marriage license without much fuss.

In the year since, Audrey worked her ass off at the office and at home. She arranged everything well, made his favorite meals, and never once complained.

Clayton could see how much she loved him in her eyes. He enjoyed being the center of her world. He believed she'd never actually leave him, and everything she said was just because she was angry.

Clayton said to Valerie, ""Vally, can you go back for now?""

""Huh?"" Valerie looked like she'd just been slapped.

Her eyes went wide in disbelief, and she thought, 'Is Clayton seriously kicking me out for Audrey?'

""I need to talk to Audrey. I'll come see you later,"" he added, looking at her with a gentler gaze, like trying to soothe a sulking child.

""Alright, I'll wait for you,"" Valerie said, but her heels didn't budge.

She turned to Audrey with a smile that barely masked her bitterness. ""Audrey, Clayton and I have known each other since we were kids. If anything were going to happen between us, it would've happened a long time ago. Don't you think?""

Just then, Zoe burst through the door, breathless. ""Ms. Patterson, come here, Luna collapsed. Her face is blue. I didn't dare move her.""

Valerie let out a sharp gasp and spun toward Clayton. ""What should I do? She had an episode yesterday too. Clayton, I'm scared.""

Clayton didn't hesitate. He turned around and went toward the living room. ""Calm down. Let's take her to the hospital right away.""

""Thank goodness you're here,"" Valerie said, sticking close to him. ""Feel my hands. I'm freezing.""

As Clayton grabbed his car keys, he suddenly thought of Audrey. His hand paused mid-air.

He turned back and looked at her, saying. ""Vally is still new to Ironhaven. She doesn't know the hospitals here. I'll take Luna to see the doctor first. Can we talk later?""

Audrey stared back at him, her face blank. She didn't give him any response.

Clayton frowned, and Valerie instantly took his arm and said, ""What if something happens to Luna? If she dies, I won't want to live.""

Without another word, Clayton grabbed the keys and rushed out the door.

Valerie followed right behind him, but before stepping outside, she turned around and shot Audrey a smug little look—one that screamed, 'See? You lost again, Audrey. I'm the one Clayton cares about above all.'

Audrey stood by the window and watched as Clayton carried Luna to the car, and Valerie slipped into the passenger seat. To any outsider, they'd look like a perfect family.

Audrey thought bitterly, 'How ridiculous. Her own kid passed out. Instead of checking on her, that woman ran straight to Clayton.

'What if he weren't here? Would she watch her daughter die? Either Clayton's too blind to see through this pathetic act or he enjoys playing her hero.'

Zoe then left too, and the house finally went quiet. Audrey went back to the bedroom and started packing her things. She wasn't going to keep tolerating this broken marriage—not for another day.

Clayton was a lawyer. If he refused to divorce, she'd have to sue him, and she knew she'd be at a disadvantage. But she wasn't scared. It was hard, but it didn't mean it was impossible.

Back when they got married on impulse, Clayton suggested they take a year to get to know each other before becoming a ""real"" couple. Audrey agreed, but on one condition—she'd buy her own house with her own money.

Now, she felt relieved that she made that decision. At least she still left herself a way out.

Audrey took out her suitcase and started packing her clothes and documents. Then, she opened her jewelry box on the vanity. Inside was the diamond necklace Clayton bought her. The diamond wasn't huge, but it cost over ten grand.

She'd barely worn it, afraid it looked too flashy. Now, all she could think was how stupid she'd been.

She never asked Clayton to stop giving money to his parents. During holidays, she always paid out of her own pocket to buy his parents some gifts to avoid conflict.

She didn't spend a dime of Clayton's money, yet Valerie and her kid were living off Clayton just fine.

Audrey took a deep breath, opened a drawer, and grabbed the incident report and withdrawal form from Ashwood Mental Hospital, along with the clean bill of health the doctor gave her when she was discharged.

Then she hailed a cab and went straight to the apartment she bought herself—only to find the lock code had been changed.

Furious, she called the police. The police showed up with the building's property manager in tow.

The manager looked nervous as hell and explained, ""Mrs. Patel, Mr. Patel told us that woman and her daughter would move in.""

Audrey held up her property deed and declared, ""I'm the legal owner here. No one can move in without my permission. That's trespassing. Officer, I want the door opened under your supervision. If they damaged my place, I'm holding them and this property company accountable.""

The manager wiped the sweat from his forehead and called in a locksmith. When the door swung open, even the police and the manager looked stunned.

The house was originally done in minimalist style—white walls, light tiles, nothing fancy. Audrey didn't have enough budget to renovate it, but it was clean and livable.

Audrey once ordered all the furniture online. Clayton told her the dimensions were wrong and the stuff had to be returned. Thus, they didn't move in yet.

But now, they really couldn't move in.

The floor was covered with takeout boxes, trash bags, soggy delivery containers, and so on. The once-pristine walls were scribbled with markers in every color. There were dark stains everywhere—god knows what caused them.

In the bedroom, bras and stockings were tossed all over the place. The air reeked of some cheap fruity perfume.

The plants Audrey had bought to clear out the formaldehyde were crammed onto the balcony, dried up like museum specimens.

With the police and building manager present, Audrey snapped photos of everything for evidence. Then she called a moving company. In front of everyone, she packed up all the junk, sealed it in boxes, and had it shipped off to Clayton's place in Hightower Homes.

When that was done, she asked the police for a formal incident report, changed the lock, and headed to her office to deal with her resignation procedure.

\*\*\*\*\*

At Ironhaven Medical Center, Clayton's good friend Carson Wilson pulled some strings to get Luna checked out fast.

After the exam, the doctor said, ""She had an allergic reaction that led to temporary airway obstruction. You'll need to figure out what triggered it. She got here in time, so she's currently fine. Still, don't take it lightly.""

""Thank you, doctor."" Valerie's eyes were full of tears. She clung to Clayton and said, ""Clay, I don't know what I would've done without you.""

But she noticed Clayton seemed distracted. Normally, the moment Valerie started crying, Clayton would be right there comforting her. Yet just now, when she tried to lean on him, he actually dodged a bit.

Valerie's heart dropped, and she thought, 'No. I can't let him slip away. Clayton is mine. I have to keep him mine.'

Through tears, she said, ""This is all my fault. I shouldn't have left Luna outside like that. But you know what Audrey did last time.

""Luna already has autism, and she's still scared from that scene. I didn't have a choice but to leave her in the living room.""

# Chapter 4 Audrey's Fight Back

""You know Luna is my whole world,"" Valerie sobbed, covering her face with both hands. ""Back then, I took beatings just to protect her. If anything happens to her now because of my carelessness, I won't forgive myself.""

Hearing her cry, Clayton felt a sudden wave of irritation rising in his chest.

He said, ""The doctor said she's fine. Don't beat yourself up. Honestly, getting her out of that mess is already brave. I've got stuff to deal with. You stay here and look after Luna, okay?""

A bad feeling crept up Valerie's spine. She asked cautiously, ""Are you worried Audrey will be mad? I can take Luna and leave. I swear we won't cause you any trouble.""

""You don't have to leave,"" Clayton replied, rubbing his temples. ""It's something at the firm.""

The real reason Clayton had Audrey sent to Ashwood Mental Hospital on her birthday was because she cut Valerie's hand. Valerie's reputation was just a minor cause.

He thought getting Audrey out of the picture would calm Valerie down, and then maybe she'd agree to drop the charges. If Audrey ended up with a record, she'd be blacklisted from half the job market.

Clayton had connections at Ashwood—his law firm handled some of their legal affairs. He personally asked the manager to put Audrey in a quiet, nicer section of the hospital and told him she just needed time to cool off.

""Audrey is not the kind to hold grudges,"" Clayton added absentmindedly.

Valerie almost lost control of her expression. She opened her mouth to say more, but Clayton had already turned around and left the ward.

Carson, waiting outside the ward, walked down the stairs with Clayton. Carson said, ""Look, man, don't take this the wrong way, but Valerie's got a strange look in her eyes when she sees you.""

Clayton shot Carson a look that could freeze hell. He warned, ""Say that again, and you're not my friend anymore.""

""Alright, alright."" Carson raised his hands in surrender. ""I'm done. Just keep your eyes open. Audrey's not your match, but she's been really good to you.""

Clayton's eyes flickered, then he turned around and left the hospital. Carson stood there watching him leave and shaking his head.

None of the guys in their circles planned to get married, and they definitely hadn't supported Clayton's impulsive marriage just to spite his family for arranging an alliance for him.

But Audrey's devotion after they got married made a few of them reconsider the whole bachelor lifestyle.

When Clayton brought Valerie back into the picture and started putting her first in everything, Carson warned him not to keep Audrey in the dark.

On Audrey's birthday, Clayton had planned to finally come clean. But they were a bit late, and the accident happened.

Once Valerie was sure the two men had left, the soft worry and guilt drained from her face in an instant. Her whole expression turned cold as she looked at Luna lying on the bed.

She muttered, ""Useless. Couldn't you have eaten a few more chestnuts? You are in no danger. Clay didn't even care to stay.""

Luna's small frame shrank into itself. Her head was too big for her frail body. She stared at her mother, her eyes wide with fear and confusion.

Just minutes after Clayton walked out, Audrey stepped into the hospital.

Carson spotted Audrey and assumed she was there to give Valerie a hard time. He was about to call Clayton when he overheard two nurses whispering nearby.

The first nurse said, ""Oh my, no one can stop them? Beating people is illegal.""

Another nurse replied, ""A 10-year-old or so boy died there last year. His folks spent six months in court. In the end, they called it an accident and got a little compensation.""

Carson walked over and said behind them, ""You two work here or just gossip for a living?""

The nurses giggled upon seeing Carson. He was kind of a big deal around here, returning from abroad with a flashy resume.

The first nurse explained, ""We were talking about Ashwood Mental Hospital, Dr. Wilson. That place is hell. I don't get why some parents send their kids there just to get them beat up.""

The other nurse added, ""The owners have people backing them. If someone gets hurt or even dies, they just throw money at it. That woman had bruises all over. Hope she gets some justice.""

Carson's brows furrowed upon hearing that. He knew Clayton had sent Audrey to Ashwood.

Lots of kids had behavioral issues, tech addictions, and attitude problems. It was said Ashwood could straighten them out.

Carson didn't think giving troubled teens a little tough love was a big deal. As far as he was concerned, a place like Ashwood Mental Hospital had its uses. Plus, Clayton knew the manager there, and Audrey was an adult, so surely they'd treat her differently.

""You can't write off a whole institution just because of a few bad stories. If it exists, there's a reason,"" Carson said before heading back to his office.

That conversation made him forget all about calling Clayton.

Meanwhile, Audrey sat in a park, holding her injury report. The staff at Ashwood didn't dare beat her outright, but they played all kinds of mental games and messed with her food.

When she caught wind of her release, she used a bathroom break to rough herself up a bit. The bruises looked terrifying but weren't actually deep.

She waited until nearly 4 p.m. before spotting a familiar figure rushing by. Audrey stood up and called out, ""Mr. Sanchez.""

Leo Sanchez, Ashwood's manager, was in his forties with a beer belly. He strode like he had something urgent to do. He glanced at Audrey and instantly looked annoyed.

""Audrey? What do you want?"" he snapped, not even bothering to call her ""Mrs. Patel"".

Audrey crooked her finger at him, signaling for him to sit on the bench.

Leo's face turned grim. He snapped, ""If you've got something to say, spit it out. I'm busy.""

""Are you rushing to Little Dreamers Preschool to pick up your lovechild?"" Audrey raised her voice.

Leo's face turned an ugly shade of red. His eyes were filled with panic and fury.

No one was supposed to know about the kid he had with his mistress, but he didn't know how Audrey found out.

The park was full of parents with their kids. If anyone heard that, word would spread fast, and he couldn't risk that kind of heat falling on his son.

Grinding his teeth, Leo walked over and sat stiffly on the bench. ""Now, talk.""

Audrey waved the medical report and tossed it onto his lap. ""While I was locked up at Ashwood, I was abused—physically and emotionally—by your staff. I want compensation for medical bills, nutrition recovery, and psychological damage.""

Leo's eyes nearly popped out at the number—150,000 dollars. He growled, ""This is extortion.""

Audrey let out a cold chuckle. ""Call it what you want. If you think I'm bluffing, I'll go straight to the cops or the press. You pick.""

A smirk flickered in Leo's eyes. He knew Clayton's law firm represented Ashwood. Clayton had personally called to make sure Audrey ""learned her lesson"". He was sure that Clayton would help her with the lawsuit.

""Does Mr. Patel know what you're up to?"" Leo asked.

Audrey thought, 'Trying to use Clayton against me? I used to care about his feelings, but now, I'd skin him alive if I could.'

She folded her arms with a sneer. ""Did Clayton also tell you I've got violent tendencies? Kinda like being legally insane."" Her voice dropped lower. ""So tell me, what would happen if I lost my mind and stabbed your son? Who would the law blame then?""

Leo's face drained of color. Audrey's file did say she had a history of extreme behavior. His staff also reported she was stubborn as hell. When they locked her in solitary, she still refused to admit anything.

Leo thought bitterly, 'This woman is really insane. Ashwood only exists because my father-in-law pulled strings. If they find out I've got a mistress and a secret kid, I'm toast.

'Valerie's about to become Mrs. Patel, anyway. Once the divorce goes through and Audrey's out of the picture, I'll stash my kid somewhere and deal with her then.'

# Chapter 5 I'm Her Family

""Fine. I'll pay your medical bills."" Leo said through clenched teeth.

Audrey tossed a pen onto his lap and said, ""Sign it. Can't have you crying later that I blackmailed you.""

Leo hunched over the paper, his expression murderous. But when he looked up again, his face had smoothed out. He then transferred the 150,000 dollars to her account without a word.

The second Leo stepped out of the park, Audrey sent a message to Leo's wife.

She sneered to herself, 'Think you'll come back for revenge? Keep dreaming. That money wasn't hush money. It was compensation. What Ashwood does behind closed doors will all be shown to the public.'

\*\*\*\*\*

On his way home, Clayton stopped to grab a coffee. Audrey used to say that coffee store had the best flavor and the price.

Just thinking about how happy Audrey would be with the coffee made him smile. But the smile froze the moment he stepped off the elevator.

The hallway outside his apartment was jammed with cardboard boxes, stacked so high that they nearly blocked the door.

One of them had soaked through at the bottom and was leaking something that smelled awful.

Clayton called the manager and then learned that Audrey had moved all of Valerie's stuff out of the new house and dumped it here.

Clayton's face went cold as ice. He wondered, 'She just stayed at Ashwood for a month. I made sure she was taken care of. She didn't even go through the actual rehab program like others.

'I just said she's not the kind to hold grudges, and she did this.'

Clayton immediately called his assistant, Carter Kemp, and ordered him to find a place for Valerie fast. He didn't want her and Luna out on the street tonight.

Carter found a spot in the complex next door and brought a couple of coworkers over to help move the boxes.

Jade from the firm showed up to lend a hand too. She asked, ""Mr. Patel, I heard Luna was hospitalized. Is she okay? What a poor kid. Seeing her mom get beat up like that, no wonder she got autism.""

She peeked into the apartment, didn't see Audrey, and lowered her voice. ""Isn't Audrey going too far? Kicking Vally and her daughter out like that is heartless.""

Clayton instinctively replied, ""That apartment belongs to Audrey.""

Jade scoffed, ""So that gives her the right to bully others?"" She bent down to lift a box, not noticing the dark look on Clayton's face.

She added, ""She has no family and no background. If you hadn't taken pity on her, she would've stayed stuck at the bottom forever.""

Lawyers had this special kind of social image, just like doctors or cops. They brought hope when people hit rock bottom. And Clayton, with his high-profile wins for the underdog, was seen as almost heroic.

Lawyers could reach both the working class and the elite. The job itself was a ladder. Jade thought without Valerie stepping away, Audrey would've never gotten a chance to marry a man like Clayton.

""Jade."" Clayton's tone went ice-cold, his eyes sharp. ""Audrey is my wife. I'm her family.""

Hearing that, Jade turned pale, and she muttered inwardly, 'I thought Mr. Patel was into Valerie. Didn't think he'd actually defend Audrey.'

""Jade, come on, I've already made two trips,"" Carter cut in, trying to shift the tension. ""If we drag this out any longer, Luna's gonna be out of the hospital before we're done.""

Jade carried a box into the elevator, still fuming. She sneered in her mind, 'Audrey just got out of Ashwood and already thinks she can throw Vally's stuff out? She really thinks she can throw a tantrum at Mr. Patel?

'Once he dumps her, she'll beg for scraps. For women like her, marrying a guy like Mr. Patel is like winning the lottery. And instead of holding onto that ticket, she's just out here lighting it on fire.'

""Ugh, what the hell is in this box?"" As soon as the elevator doors opened, Jade dropped the box. Takeout containers rolled out across the floor. She complained, ""Did she seriously pack trash into these boxes? What is wrong with her?""

She glanced over her shoulder, worried Clayton might've followed. When she didn't see him, she kicked the box hard and said, ""Carter, I got my clothes tainted. I'm going home to change.""

Once everything was done, Clayton sat alone in his car, exhaustion dragging down his face.

That case he'd been working on recently had been a mess, so he left Audrey in Ashwood a few extra days just to deal with it. The second he had a breather, he brought her home and even asked Zoe to cook her favorite dishes.

He honestly didn't get it. He had promised that once Valerie and Luna settled down, he'd hand over the rest of his salary to Audrey. He couldn't understand why Audrey still threw a tantrum like this.

Frustration flared in his chest, and he thought, 'Just because I took Luna to the hospital, she dumped all of Vally's stuff here? Valerie's been through enough already. Luna's got serious autism for God's sake. That woman is unreasonable.'

He glanced at the cup of coffee in the passenger seat—the one he bought for Audrey. His jaw clenched. Without a second thought, he grabbed it and chucked it out of the window into a trash can.

\*\*\*\*\*

Audrey spent the night in a budget hotel. Her new house was a mess after Valerie's stay and needed repainting before she could move in again.

She had already made up her mind about the divorce, so she wouldn't drag it out. To her, men were seasoning, but money was the main course.

Sprawled across the bed, she browsed a job website on her phone. She used to work as an admin at a trading company, but maybe the timing was off, and she couldn't find anything in that field.

It was just summer break, so tons of people were hiring tutors online. Audrey had done tutoring back in college, so it would be a choice for her now.

1llznxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1llznxp/theres_a_man_who_cleans_my_5thfloor_window_every/,There's a man who cleans my 5th-floor window every night at 3 AM. My landlord says he doesn't exist.,"To understand, you need to know my situation. It’s not unique. I’m a young guy, working a dead-end, minimum-wage job that requires me to be up before the sun. If I’m late, my pay gets docked. No exceptions. I live in a small, cheap apartment on the fifth floor of a pre-war building that’s seen better decades. The plumbing groans, the floors creak, and the windows rattle when the wind blows just right. But it’s what I can afford. The most important thing in my life, the thing my entire precarious existence balances on, is a good night’s sleep.

And for the last few weeks, something has been stealing that from me.

It happened about a month ago, and i still can't clear my mind of it, I was deep asleep, probably dreaming about something mundane like stocking shelves or making coffee, when a sound dragged me violently back to consciousness.

It was a grating, rhythmic scraping noise. Right outside my window.

Shhhh-kreeet… shhhh-kreeet… shhhh-kreeet…

It was the kind of sound that sets your teeth on edge, like nails on a chalkboard made of glass. I lay there in the darkness, my heart hammering against my ribs, trying to place it. A tree branch? No, there are no trees tall enough to reach the fifth floor. I glanced at my alarm clock. 3:17 AM.

Shhhh-kreeet… shhhh-kreeet…

It was slow, deliberate, and undeniably human. Someone was out there. On the fifth floor. My mind raced through a dozen impossible, terrifying scenarios. Finally, fueled by a mix of fear and angry exhaustion, I slid out of bed and crept to the window. The thin curtains were drawn, but the sound was coming from directly behind them. I took a deep breath, grabbed the edge of the fabric, and pulled it back an inch.

There was a man out there.

He was old, with deep, cavernous lines etched into his face, wearing a set of faded gray worker's coveralls. He was perched on… something. I couldn’t see it clearly in the dark, but I assumed it was one of those window washing platforms, the kind that hangs from the roof. In his weathered, bony hands, he held a long-handled brush with stiff, dirty bristles, and he was methodically dragging it back and forth across my windowpane.

I stared for a second, my fear giving way to pure, baffled anger. I approched the window so he can hear me.

“What the hell are you doing?” I hissed, my voice a harsh whisper.

The old man stopped his scraping and turned his head slowly. His face was pale in the moonlight, his eyes dark, sunken pits. He didn't seem surprised to see me.

“Evening, son,” he said, his voice a dry, gravelly rasp. “Just doing my job.”

“Your job? It’s three o’clock in the morning!” I said, trying to keep my voice down but failing. “You’re making a racket! People are trying to sleep!”

He just shrugged, a slow, tired movement of his thin shoulders. “Landlord’s orders. Wants the facade cleaned every night. Says it keeps the building looking sharp during the day. Gotta get it all done before sunrise.”

My anger deflated, replaced by confusion. That made no sense. What landlord in their right mind would pay for nightly window washing, especially on a rundown building like this? And why at this hour? It was the most absurd, inefficient thing I’d ever heard.

“Look,” the old man said, his voice softening slightly. “I don’t make the rules. I just follow them. I’m just an old man trying to make a living. If you’ve got a problem, you should take it up with the landlord in the morning. For now, I’ve got a job to do.”

He turned back to the window, ready to resume his scraping. I was about to pull the curtains again when he said with different look on his face.

“Say, son,” he rasped, licking his dry, cracked lips. “My throat’s as dry as a bone. You wouldn’t have a glass of water you could spare for an old man, would you? It’s a long way down and a long way back up.” He gestured with his thumb towards the darkness below. “Just… open the window. And give me some water”

I hesitated. It was a simple request. A harmless one. But something about it felt wrong. The idea of opening my window, in my bedroom, in the middle of the night, to this stranger suspended in the darkness… a cold knot of dread formed in my stomach. It was an instinct, a primal feeling of no, don't do that.

“Sorry,” I said, my voice tight. “I… can’t. The latch is broken. And i can't move it” It was a stupid lie, but it was the first thing that came to mind.

The old man’s face darkened. The tired, folksy demeanor vanished, replaced by a flicker of cold, hard anger in his eyes. It was there for just a second, and then it was gone, hidden again behind the weary mask. “Suit yourself,” he muttered, and turned back to his work.

Shhhh-kreeet… shhhh-kreeet…

I got back into bed, but sleep was impossible. The scraping sound continued for another hour before finally stopping. I lay awake until my alarm went off, my mind buzzing with anger and confusion.

The next morning, on my way to work, I stopped by the landlord’s office on the ground floor. He was a portly, balding man who always looked like he’d just woken up from a bad nap.

“Excuse me,” I started, trying to sound polite. “I just have a quick question. About the window washer.”

He blinked at me, his face a mask of confusion. “The what?”

“The window washer,” I repeated. “The old man you hired to clean the building facade at night. He woke me up at 3 AM. It’s really loud. Is there any way he could do it during the day?”

The landlord stared at me for a long moment. Then he let out a short, barking laugh. “Window washer? Kid, are you feeling okay? Look at this place.” He gestured around his dusty, cluttered office. “Do I look like the kind of guy who pays for nightly window washing? I haven’t had the windows on this building cleaned in ten years.”

“But… there was a man,” I insisted. “He said you hired him.”

“Then the man was lying,” the landlord said, his tone shifting from amusement to annoyance. “Probably a crazy person. Or maybe you were dreaming, kid. You look like you could use some sleep. Nobody else has complained about a thing. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m busy.” He turned back to his paperwork, a clear dismissal.

I walked to work in a daze. Was I dreaming? It had felt so real. The sound, the cold air, the look on the man’s face… But the landlord was right. No one would clean this building at night. It made no sense. I must have been overtired, stressed out. It had to be a dream. A very, very vivid anxiety dream.

I managed to convince myself of that for the rest of the day. But that night, I went to bed with a sense of gnawing dread.

And sure enough, at 3:24 AM, I was woken by the same sound.

Shhhh-kreeet… shhhh-kreeet…

I sat bolt upright in bed. My heart was pounding. This wasn't a dream. This was real. He was back.

I got out of bed, my fear now mixed with a cold, hard anger. I marched to the window and ripped the curtains open.

He was there. The same old man, the same faded coveralls, the same relentless scraping. He looked even more comfortable tonight, perched on his invisible platform, like he belonged there in the night sky. He saw me and gave me a slow, almost lazy nod.

I approached the window, my hands shaking with adrenaline. “I talked to the landlord,” I said, my voice sharp. “He’s never heard of you. He didn’t hire you. So why don’t you tell me what you’re really doing out here before I call the police?”

The old man stopped his work. He sighed, a long, theatrical sound. He turned to face me, and his expression was completely different from the night before. His face was a mask of profound, heartbreaking sadness.

“Please, son,” he said, his voice trembling. “Please don’t do that. I… I need this job.”

“It’s not a job!” I snapped. “You’re lying! Who are you?”

Tears seemed to well up in his dark, sunken eyes. “The landlord… he must have forgotten. Or maybe he just said that. He pays me in cash, you see. Off the books. He’s not a bad man, just… forgetful.” He leaned closer to the glass, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “But I need this. Every penny. My… my little girl… she’s sick. Very sick. Needs an operation. An expensive one. This is the only work an old man like me can get.”

I felt a pang of sympathy. What if he was telling the truth? What if I was about to ruin this poor old man’s life over a little lost sleep?

He must have seen the hesitation in my eyes, because he pressed his advantage. “I know you’re a kind boy,” he said, his voice thick with emotion. “I can see it in your face. You wouldn’t want to hurt a little girl, would you? Maybe… maybe you could help me? I don’t even need the job if you could just… help. A little spare money? Anything you have. It would all go towards her surgery. Just open the window. Please. Or… or maybe just something to eat? I haven’t eaten since yesterday morning. I’m so hungry, I can barely stand.”

And just like that, the spell was broken. This was too much. The desperation was too theatrical. The hunger, the sick little girl, the landlord… it was a web of lies, and every single strand was designed to do one thing: get me to open my window.

I didn’t say another word. I just backed away from the window, pulled out my phone, and with my eyes locked on his, I dialed the police.

I put the phone to my ear. “Yes, hello? I’d like to report a prowler…”

The old man’s face changed. The mask of sadness dissolved. The pleading look vanished. His eyes went cold and flat, and a horrible, twisted smile spread across his lips. He knew he had lost.

He slowly raised his hands in the air, as if in surrender. “You win, son,” he rasped, his voice no longer sad or gravelly, but a smooth, chilling baritone.

And then he threw himself backward.

It was a fluid, almost graceful movement. He just leaned back and fell, off the thing he was sitting on, into the black emptiness of the night.

A scream tore from my throat. He’d killed himself. He’d jumped, right in front of me. I scrambled to the window, my mind screaming, and threw it open wide, leaning out to look down, expecting to see a body, to hear a scream, to see anything.

And I saw nothing.

I looked down. Five stories of sheer brick wall dropped to the dark, empty alley below. There was no body. There was no platform. There was no scaffolding. There were no ropes, no harness, no cherry picker.

There was nothing.

There was absolutely nothing for a man to sit on, stand on, or hang from outside my fifth-floor window. It was just thin air.

I clung to the windowsill, the cold night wind whipping at my face, my mind trying to process the impossible. He hadn't been sitting on anything. He had been floating. Levitating. And he hadn't fallen. He had just… vanished.

I stumbled back into my room, my body shaking uncontrollably. The police operator was still talking on the phone I’d dropped, her tinny voice asking if I was still there.

I hung up. What could I tell them? That a floating ghost tried to trick me into opening my window?

I’m writing this now because I need to warn you. Be careful of the things that knock in the night. Be careful of the voices that ask for your help. Listen to that cold, primal feeling in your gut. It’s there for a reason. It’s there to protect you from the things that stand on the other side of the glass, smiling and begging to be [let in](https://www.reddit.com/user/gamalfrank/).

I've been living away from them for 4 years now because they live like hoarders. Every summer our 2 indoor cats and 2 outdoor cats get really bad fleas. Last year in the summer I went and actually managed to treat it with extensive vacuuming, flea drop medications, and carpet sprays. This summer, however, is way worse.

I'm only here for 12 more days, and I'm counting down the seconds until I can get out of this house. I have dozens of flea bites all over my feet and ankles. A flea jumped into my coffee this morning. I feel like I'm having a mental breakdown. They wont let me put the flea prevention drops on the cats because it made them pretty lethargic last time. All I can do is vaccumm the room I stay in, spray carpet flea killer spray, and bedding safe flea spray all over my bed every day and also wash my blankets, but I keep tracking in random fleas from outside my room which end up in my bed to bite me. I wear long pants and long socks and now they've resorted to biting my arms. My parents just go ""oh that sucks...I haven't been seeing bites on me"" and pretending nothing is happening.

Im so fucking anxious I'm going to get typhus or tapeworms from being here. I swear I thought I even dug out a flea from my ear so I've been wearing earbuds at night to hopefully prevent any of that from happening. I just want to go home and I want this to be over. Please tell me I'm not gonna get a disease or tapeworm, or flea eggs in my ear!! This is making me sick :(",2,1751044970.0,Anxiety,2,1.0,False

1llzn80,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1llzn80/is_my_husband_a_narcissist_or_just_selfish/,Is my husband a narcissist or just selfish?,"Background on myself: 30 F, ASD/ADHD, mother of 2, married for 4-5 years

Lately I've been feeling down at the thought that I may be with a narcissist again. My Only other relationship I was with a man who emotionally and physically abused me. Always made stories about me to everyone we knew, he would use it against me and say ""see even this {person} agrees with me"". Eventually I ended up with no friends or people to talk to. 

Now with my current husband, last summer I found out that he has been cheating since the beginning of our relationship. If it matters it has all taken place online. He claimed that it stemmed from his porn addiction. When I found out, I was breaking down- honestly never thought I could be hurt that much, he just watched me cry with a blank stare- no apologies. Truly, he has never seen me cried so perhaps he was shocked. He didn't try to work on the relationship or anything he just got on Snapchat and started talking and flirting with a lady. 

Before finding out, he would always call himself the best husband every time he will do something ""for me"", when he would speak about loving me; he always cried. That's something that he and his mother have in common- they cry on command. Always seemed disingenuous to me. 

I guess I somewhat need help understanding if this is normal: I love gift giving and writing letters. He has never done those. For Christmas, birthdays etc. I always bought his family presents (out my own pocket). They will always thank him and he wouldn't interject and say it's from both of us. The actions that stood out the most were when I got his step niece some Halloween goodies, prepped and bought them myself- he gave it to her and said 'I made this for you"", she said ""That's not how my name is spelled', he said: ""oh well I didn't do that"". The second time: I was writing his grandmother a letter, I always ask him to write something, he wrote, closed the enveloped and wrote that it is from him. To then later brag to his mother that he sent her a card. Everything I do from hobbies to just normal tasks its always 'we"" and him telling his mother about it because she praises him and tells him; hes a good father and husband. And when he gets involved with something I am doing- it turns into ""I did this...""

During the time I found out he has been unfaithful, his mother has commented under a picture post that I reposted saying 'At least you have a good husband"", she did this very frequently commenting how great of a husband he is; which i find very weird commenting on a relationship you are not a part of. I deleted her comment. And she texted him saying that I make him look bad online. i had asked my husband if he could please ask her to stop leaving such comments on my posts in their conversation she assumed that he was unfaithful- the odd part was that she didn't ask him to work on himself etc. she made me the blame and he said nothing. Nothing to put the blame on himself. It's just always 'my baby is so perfect and great husband"" 

I am at a lost of what I should be doing, recently I just didn't talk for a couple of days because he wanted me to do something for him and hit me with the ""well today I did this, and this and this for you"" which happens very often I tend to just make coffee for myself so he doesn't have to add it to a list to brag to me about later. 

While my husband doesn't harm me physically, It almost feel like I am with the same narcissist person again. I don't know what to do, if I should be changing anything? 

I've been working on building that love again but hearing selfish words from him, having to spend time with his family who seem to not like me at all especially his mother and hearing him brag about all the things that 'he"" does is draining.. from me doing my daughters hair- nothing grand just a normal thing- I get ""her hair looks nice, I wish my son had something to do with this"". I'm mentioning this because I am already anxious that I have to sit through lunch tomorrow with her and him. ",1,1751044923.0,NarcissisticSpouses,1,1.0,False

Tears seemed to well up in his dark, sunken eyes. “The landlord… he must have forgotten. Or maybe he just said that. He pays me in cash, you see. Off the books. He’s not a bad man, just… forgetful.” He leaned closer to the glass, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “But I need this. Every penny. My… my little girl… she’s sick. Very sick. Needs an operation. An expensive one. This is the only work an old man like me can get.”

I felt a pang of sympathy. What if he was telling the truth? What if I was about to ruin this poor old man’s life over a little lost sleep?

He must have seen the hesitation in my eyes, because he pressed his advantage. “I know you’re a kind boy,” he said, his voice thick with emotion. “I can see it in your face. You wouldn’t want to hurt a little girl, would you? Maybe… maybe you could help me? I don’t even need the job if you could just… help. A little spare money? Anything you have. It would all go towards her surgery. Just open the window. Please. Or… or maybe just something to eat? I haven’t eaten since yesterday morning. I’m so hungry, I can barely stand.”

And just like that, the spell was broken. This was too much. The desperation was too theatrical. The hunger, the sick little girl, the landlord… it was a web of lies, and every single strand was designed to do one thing: get me to open my window.

I didn’t say another word. I just backed away from the window, pulled out my phone, and with my eyes locked on his, I dialed the police.

I put the phone to my ear. “Yes, hello? I’d like to report a prowler…”

The old man’s face changed. The mask of sadness dissolved. The pleading look vanished. His eyes went cold and flat, and a horrible, twisted smile spread across his lips. He knew he had lost.

He slowly raised his hands in the air, as if in surrender. “You win, son,” he rasped, his voice no longer sad or gravelly, but a smooth, chilling baritone.

And then he threw himself backward.

It was a fluid, almost graceful movement. He just leaned back and fell, off the thing he was sitting on, into the black emptiness of the night.

A scream tore from my throat. He’d killed himself. He’d jumped, right in front of me. I scrambled to the window, my mind screaming, and threw it open wide, leaning out to look down, expecting to see a body, to hear a scream, to see anything.

And I saw nothing.

I looked down. Five stories of sheer brick wall dropped to the dark, empty alley below. There was no body. There was no platform. There was no scaffolding. There were no ropes, no harness, no cherry picker.

There was nothing.

There was absolutely nothing for a man to sit on, stand on, or hang from outside my fifth-floor window. It was just thin air.

I clung to the windowsill, the cold night wind whipping at my face, my mind trying to process the impossible. He hadn't been sitting on anything. He had been floating. Levitating. And he hadn't fallen. He had just… vanished.

I stumbled back into my room, my body shaking uncontrollably. The police operator was still talking on the phone I’d dropped, her tinny voice asking if I was still there.

I hung up. What could I tell them? That a floating ghost tried to trick me into opening my window?

1llzmi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1llzmi7/theres_a_man_who_cleans_my_5thfloor_window_every/,There's a man who cleans my 5th-floor window every night at 3 AM. My landlord says he doesn't exist.,"To understand, you need to know my situation. It’s not unique. I’m a young guy, working a dead-end, minimum-wage job that requires me to be up before the sun. If I’m late, my pay gets docked. No exceptions. I live in a small, cheap apartment on the fifth floor of a pre-war building that’s seen better decades. The plumbing groans, the floors creak, and the windows rattle when the wind blows just right. But it’s what I can afford. The most important thing in my life, the thing my entire precarious existence balances on, is a good night’s sleep.



And for the last few weeks, something has been stealing that from me.



It happened about a month ago, and i still can't clear my mind of it, I was deep asleep, probably dreaming about something mundane like stocking shelves or making coffee, when a sound dragged me violently back to consciousness.



It was a grating, rhythmic scraping noise. Right outside my window.



Shhhh-kreeet… shhhh-kreeet… shhhh-kreeet…



It was the kind of sound that sets your teeth on edge, like nails on a chalkboard made of glass. I lay there in the darkness, my heart hammering against my ribs, trying to place it. A tree branch? No, there are no trees tall enough to reach the fifth floor. I glanced at my alarm clock. 3:17 AM.



Shhhh-kreeet… shhhh-kreeet…



It was slow, deliberate, and undeniably human. Someone was out there. On the fifth floor. My mind raced through a dozen impossible, terrifying scenarios. Finally, fueled by a mix of fear and angry exhaustion, I slid out of bed and crept to the window. The thin curtains were drawn, but the sound was coming from directly behind them. I took a deep breath, grabbed the edge of the fabric, and pulled it back an inch.



There was a man out there.



He was old, with deep, cavernous lines etched into his face, wearing a set of faded gray worker's coveralls. He was perched on… something. I couldn’t see it clearly in the dark, but I assumed it was one of those window washing platforms, the kind that hangs from the roof. In his weathered, bony hands, he held a long-handled brush with stiff, dirty bristles, and he was methodically dragging it back and forth across my windowpane.



I stared for a second, my fear giving way to pure, baffled anger. I approched the window so he can hear me.



“What the hell are you doing?” I hissed, my voice a harsh whisper.



The old man stopped his scraping and turned his head slowly. His face was pale in the moonlight, his eyes dark, sunken pits. He didn't seem surprised to see me.



“Evening, son,” he said, his voice a dry, gravelly rasp. “Just doing my job.”



“Your job? It’s three o’clock in the morning!” I said, trying to keep my voice down but failing. “You’re making a racket! People are trying to sleep!”



He just shrugged, a slow, tired movement of his thin shoulders. “Landlord’s orders. Wants the facade cleaned every night. Says it keeps the building looking sharp during the day. Gotta get it all done before sunrise.”



My anger deflated, replaced by confusion. That made no sense. What landlord in their right mind would pay for nightly window washing, especially on a rundown building like this? And why at this hour? It was the most absurd, inefficient thing I’d ever heard.



“Look,” the old man said, his voice softening slightly. “I don’t make the rules. I just follow them. I’m just an old man trying to make a living. If you’ve got a problem, you should take it up with the landlord in the morning. For now, I’ve got a job to do.”



He turned back to the window, ready to resume his scraping. I was about to pull the curtains again when he said with different look on his face.



“Say, son,” he rasped, licking his dry, cracked lips. “My throat’s as dry as a bone. You wouldn’t have a glass of water you could spare for an old man, would you? It’s a long way down and a long way back up.” He gestured with his thumb towards the darkness below. “Just… open the window.  And give me some water”



I hesitated. It was a simple request. A harmless one. But something about it felt wrong. The idea of opening my window, in my bedroom, in the middle of the night, to this stranger suspended in the darkness… a cold knot of dread formed in my stomach. It was an instinct, a primal feeling of no, don't do that.



“Sorry,” I said, my voice tight. “I… can’t. The latch is broken. And i can't move it” It was a stupid lie, but it was the first thing that came to mind.



The old man’s face darkened. The tired, folksy demeanor vanished, replaced by a flicker of cold, hard anger in his eyes. It was there for just a second, and then it was gone, hidden again behind the weary mask. “Suit yourself,” he muttered, and turned back to his work.



Shhhh-kreeet… shhhh-kreeet…



I got back into bed, but sleep was impossible. The scraping sound continued for another hour before finally stopping. I lay awake until my alarm went off, my mind buzzing with anger and confusion.



The next morning, on my way to work, I stopped by the landlord’s office on the ground floor. He was a portly, balding man who always looked like he’d just woken up from a bad nap.



“Excuse me,” I started, trying to sound polite. “I just have a quick question. About the window washer.”



He blinked at me, his face a mask of confusion. “The what?”



“The window washer,” I repeated. “The old man you hired to clean the building facade at night. He woke me up at 3 AM. It’s really loud. Is there any way he could do it during the day?”



The landlord stared at me for a long moment. Then he let out a short, barking laugh. “Window washer? Kid, are you feeling okay? Look at this place.” He gestured around his dusty, cluttered office. “Do I look like the kind of guy who pays for nightly window washing? I haven’t had the windows on this building cleaned in ten years.”



“But… there was a man,” I insisted. “He said you hired him.”



“Then the man was lying,” the landlord said, his tone shifting from amusement to annoyance. “Probably a crazy person. Or maybe you were dreaming, kid. You look like you could use some sleep. Nobody else has complained about a thing. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m busy.” He turned back to his paperwork, a clear dismissal.



I walked to work in a daze. Was I dreaming? It had felt so real. The sound, the cold air, the look on the man’s face… But the landlord was right. No one would clean this building at night. It made no sense. I must have been overtired, stressed out. It had to be a dream. A very, very vivid anxiety dream.



I managed to convince myself of that for the rest of the day. But that night, I went to bed with a sense of gnawing dread.



And sure enough, at 3:24 AM, I was woken by the same sound.



Shhhh-kreeet… shhhh-kreeet…



I sat bolt upright in bed. My heart was pounding. This wasn't a dream. This was real. He was back.



I got out of bed, my fear now mixed with a cold, hard anger. I marched to the window and ripped the curtains open.



He was there. The same old man, the same faded coveralls, the same relentless scraping. He looked even more comfortable tonight, perched on his invisible platform, like he belonged there in the night sky. He saw me and gave me a slow, almost lazy nod.



I approached the window, my hands shaking with adrenaline. “I talked to the landlord,” I said, my voice sharp. “He’s never heard of you. He didn’t hire you. So why don’t you tell me what you’re really doing out here before I call the police?”



The old man stopped his work. He sighed, a long, theatrical sound. He turned to face me, and his expression was completely different from the night before. His face was a mask of profound, heartbreaking sadness.



“Please, son,” he said, his voice trembling. “Please don’t do that. I… I need this job.”



“It’s not a job!” I snapped. “You’re lying! Who are you?”



Tears seemed to well up in his dark, sunken eyes. “The landlord… he must have forgotten. Or maybe he just said that. He pays me in cash, you see. Off the books. He’s not a bad man, just… forgetful.” He leaned closer to the glass, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “But I need this. Every penny. My… my little girl… she’s sick. Very sick. Needs an operation. An expensive one. This is the only work an old man like me can get.”



 I felt a pang of sympathy. What if he was telling the truth? What if I was about to ruin this poor old man’s life over a little lost sleep?



He must have seen the hesitation in my eyes, because he pressed his advantage. “I know you’re a kind boy,” he said, his voice thick with emotion. “I can see it in your face. You wouldn’t want to hurt a little girl, would you? Maybe… maybe you could help me? I don’t even need the job if you could just… help. A little spare money? Anything you have. It would all go towards her surgery. Just open the window. Please. Or… or maybe just something to eat? I haven’t eaten since yesterday morning. I’m so hungry, I can barely stand.”



And just like that, the spell was broken. This was too much. The desperation was too theatrical. The hunger, the sick little girl, the landlord… it was a web of lies, and every single strand was designed to do one thing: get me to open my window.





I didn’t say another word. I just backed away from the window, pulled out my phone, and with my eyes locked on his, I dialed the police.

*It’s day eight.* 

*I’ve never made it this long before.*

*I'll be dead soon.*

\*\*\*

Horror, Romance, Sci-Fi, Action—I won’t go through all of them, but like most people in this century, you probably recognize your movie genres. If *not*, then stop wasting time outside and watch a movie for once. If *so*, then my hat off to you. Congrats on becoming yet another mindless sheep, in our modern consumer society. 

That’s beside the point. 

What I’m trying to explain is that these are the typical categories every movie fits into. The *nameable* ones.

Then there’s what I might refer to as *offshoot* genres. *Sub-genres,* maybe? I haven’t found the perfect word yet, but they’re what you might consider the plotlines that keep popping up, across main genres, to slight variation. Something a bit more than tropes and a bit less than full-on categories.

Think ‘You’ve Got Mail’ or ‘Back to the Future’. There’s dozens of movies and books in romance, comedy, fantasy, with the same general plot. Maybe the most recurring offshoot genre, though, is *Groundhog day.*

Off the top of my head, I can think of: Happy Deathday, The Map of Tiny Perfect Things, Live, Die, Repeat. I’ll stop there, but I could go on. You probably could too. There's tons of movies with a dozen varied plots about people reliving the same day over and over again, but the one thing they all have in common? The one thing that we, as a society, seem to latch onto with a morbid fascination? When the main character dies (frequently by killing themselves), they reappear in their bed, unscathed.

Yeah. That’s not how it works for me.

\*\*\*

*Day ten.*

*I’m hearing voices now.*

\*\*\*

I noticed my first injury, maybe two-ish months into the whole Groundhogs day experience. 

I’ll spare you the boring details. As I’ve said, you already know this trope: man goes about his day, man wakes up the next day to the same day as before, man enters denial, man accepts he’s in a time loop. Etcetera. Etcetera.

I was at what you might call the ‘fun and games’ part of this whole experience, the part when you've realized all the crazy stuff you get to do now. My days consisted of buying winning lottery tickets, cruising around in expensive sports cars, and copious amounts of bacon and ice cream.

This particular day I’d decided to give skydiving a try for the first time in my life, because why not?

The freefall? Ten out of ten stars. The landing? Two. If I’m being generous. 

There was a fair bit of scraping and tumbling. A branch cut through my pant leg and sliced up my shin pretty badly. *Eh,* I thought. *Whatever.* I tipped my instructor a few hundred bucks anyways, knowing my leg would heal itself by the next day anyways.

Except, it didn’t.

I woke up as normal. 7:18 sharp. When I got out of bed though, my leg still ached. The cuts were still there, weeping slightly. The bandages were gone, but I hadn't healed.

For a few minutes I thought the time loop was over and I’d advanced to the next day after only a few weeks, except when I checked the news, it was still the same day as always. My timeline had reset.

I hadn't.

I’d been so familiar with the ‘Groundhogs day’ plotline, I hadn't considered that the logistics might work differently in my situation. Once I did realize, there were little clues I hadn't paid attention to before.

The biggest signs were my hair and weight. 

In my defense, I’m well into my forties, balding, sedentary, and divorced―my appearance is something I stopped paying much attention to years ago. Once I knew to look, though, the hair I did have was longer than normal. When I finally stepped on the scale, I’d gained nearly twenty pounds. *So much for eating like a twenty-year old.*

There were little things I started noticing too.

 I would find myself subconsciously biting at my growing nails.  Every once in a while, I’d get a cold that would last multiple days. The world around me stayed the same, repeating over and over, but I kept changing.

\*\*\*

*Day eleven.*

*That’s the world record.*

*One more day and I set a new one.*

\*\*\*

My life calmed down after the realization I could still get hurt. It’s a lot harder to go clubbing when you know you’ll have to deal with the hangover (also I’m too old). And getting in a high speed chase with the cops isn’t nearly as fun when there’s a chance you snap your neck in an accident.

Instead, I did safer things: for a time, reading, and movies, and instruments, and such. Eventually, I just started spending more days with my daughter.

For context, my ‘reset’ day was two weeks before my only daughter's wedding. At exactly 10:46 each morning she would call me for help fixing the door in her fiance’s rickety family barn. She and he were renovating it to use for the wedding ceremony, but for obvious reasons, I’d stopped offering to help early into my time loop. What was the point when the progress would reset the next morning?

Well. I started again anyways. 

Sure, it was a fool’s task, but she was my only daughter. After the divorce, she’d gone with her Mom, and ever since, we’d never had the most comfortable of relationships. I’d call her on birthdays, and she’d call me when she needed help with a repair job. Apart from that, we were distant. It was sheer luck that my reset day happened to be one when she needed me. 

Her fiance, Greg, would show up too, at the end of every work day. 

I’d never spoken with him much. Like I said, my daughter and I were hardly close. Greg and I? No chance.

We’d talk now though. Every day. He and she didn’t remember it, but I would. It’s amazing the sheer variety of conversations you can have in a given situation. 

In ‘Groundhogs day’, people would repeat themselves over and over. Even if Bill Murray differed from what he said the day before, the other person would continue on the same persistent course, as if determined to stick to the script. 

My time loop wasn’t like that. A sneeze could change the trajectory of a conversation. A question or the emphasis I put on a certain response changed things entirely. Subjects would repeat. Certain ideas or moods would persist, but overall, our days would vary. Sometimes, she would invite me to stay for dinner. Sometimes, I would storm out after a fight. Sometimes, we would just laugh the whole afternoon.

Slowly, the bad days lessened. I knew how to handle sensitive topics and how my daughter felt about our rocky relationship. I was getting to know her for what seemed the first time ever. Her fiance too. Greg was a good guy, caring and kind and all that. 

I visited them almost every day for… well, not sure exactly. That was before I started tattooing the weeks on my arms. A few years maybe? It was a sort of peaceful perfection. I was closer to them than ever.

In the end, that’s why I stopped going again.

I knew them better and better, but they didn’t know me. Day after day, I was still the dad my daughter didn’t trust. The *other* parent Greg had never really met. After years of that, of being unable to repair things…

It was hard.

I started experimenting instead. By this point most of my hair had gone gray with age. If I couldn’t figure out how to end this, I would waste away in this one single day.

The tattooing started. At first, I would go to a parlor and sit there while they carved a new mark on my arm each week. Eventually, I learned to do it myself.

I would get on planes, go as far as I could to see if that would reset things. Never did.

I went to therapy. That’s how Murray solved his crisis, wasn't it? Self-betterment. I read the bible. I forgave my ex. I tried *fixing* myself for months and months. No success.

Eventually, I realized how my timeline reset. I’d always assumed it was a time based thing―at 3:46 am everything would reset―but no. It was sleep based. Life kept going on as long as I stayed awake. 

For a while I played around with that, staying up to the next day, carrying over the consequences of the day before and the conversations I’d had. It was my first semblance of continuity. Sometimes, I would stay up three, even four days, then collapse exhausted and sleep for a reset or two. I was into my fifties, though. Staying up wasn’t so easy. I resigned myself to my normal sleep schedule.

I experimented. I tested. I tried to escape. Nothing worked.

\*\*\*

*Day twelve.*

*I’ve beaten the record.* 

*The voices have faces now.*

\*\*\*

I couldn't escape.

I tried everything short of jumping off a bridge. I would have done that too, but it’s when time would start back up. I was sure of it―still am. My life would end, and my daughter would know nothing besides the fact I’d done it to myself. That wasn’t something I could put her through. 

I was older now. Once I tried revisiting her, and her eyes had bulged outwards as she tried to piece together who this elderly stranger was.

*No more*, I told myself

No more visiting anybody I used to know. Instead, I avoided them in the street or wore a hat and shades as I went about my life, if you could call it that.

“Why?” I would scream at the sky.

That's who became the enemy in place of a visible culprit. The sky. The universe.

“Let me go!”

It didn't. 

Years passed. 

At times I would come to terms with my life. Then I would hate it all over again. My state of mind was rarely consistent or stable. There was no way for me to feel ambition, to form connections. I got older and older, almost seventy now.

Every morning my daughter would still call. That was the thing that hurt most. 

Knowing I would never see her again.

\*\*\*

*Day thirteen.*

*Thirteen.*

*Thirteen.*

\*\*\*

And then, I decided I would.

*How young,* I thought about the reporter on the news. I caught a snippet of him while going for my morning coffee, and a memory bubbled up. *How old,* I'd thought about the same exact man long, long ago.

We'd switched spots, switched ages, and I knew this was it. My life was over one way or another, even if time started back up. There was only one thing left I wanted to do: see my daughter get married.

It was the first true goal I’d had in decades. My mind hooked onto it, and the barbs sunk deep. I didn’t even wait to prepare that very first attempt, simply drank my caffeine and pulled an all nighter.

The first night was fine. I was hyped on the excitement of it all. By morning I was fading, but determined. The second night, I paced around my living room, trying desperately to stay awake. The third night was torture, but I’d already gone three nights without sleep in my experiments.

The fourth night I sat in the bathroom and, just to add salt to the wound, fell asleep on the toilet of all places.

It took me a week to recover. I slept two days straight (or one day, twice in a row, I suppose), then about twelve hours each night after that. At the end of that first week, I made my second attempt.

Big mistake. That’s what I learned. This time I made it only two nights before collapsing. It took time to recover from things like serious sleep deprivation, especially at my age.

I didn’t give up. Over and over I would make the attempt. Sometimes I’d wait a month between attempts. Sometimes, I could only stand to wait a week or two.

*It’s like working out,* I reasoned. *You get stronger with time.*

That wasn’t at all how it worked. Instead, I was wasting away. My skin stretched thin around my bones, and my gaunt face became more and more unrecognizable.

Still, I kept going. 

I found little tricks for keeping myself awake. If I needed to sit, I would clamp a mousetrap on my finger. When my eyes drooped while standing, I carried a needle around my neck to prick the back of my hand. Slowly, my personal records improved.

Six days.

Then seven.

Then nine.

By the time I got to ten full days, nearly five years had passed. I gave myself six weeks to recuperate, and yet at the end of them, I still wasn’t fully back to normal. At my age, you didn’t recover in the same way as younger folk.

If I did make it to my daughter’s wedding fourteen days away, I wouldn’t survive the experience. That much was clear. It was also clear I only had one more try left in me.

I waited two more weeks before the final attempt.

I began.

The first seven days were easy. I’d gotten that far dozens of times by now. 

The eighth was less so. I walked for miles that night. Up and down my street. Gas station to gas station, a Red Bull every hour on the dot. 

The ninth night I was no less tired, but I pushed through, because I knew what was waiting for me the afternoon of the tenth day: rain. That’s what the weather forecast said, and sure enough, at noon on the dot, it started drizzling.

I bawled like a toddler. It had been more than twenty years since I’d felt rain.

“I will beat you,” I screamed up at the sky. “You won’t take this from me.”

Eleven days. Further than I’d ever come. The hallucinations got worse. Voices. Lights in the corner of my vision. *Things* prowling just beyond my peripheral. Even so, I was single minded.

Twelve days. I had no appetite, but I forced myself to eat. When I couldn’t stomach food, I’d down more caffeine. My arms were red and raw; I’d torn nearly every hair from them.

“Daddy,” my daughter said over the phone. “You’ll walk me down the aisle, right?”

“I’m not feeling well,” I told her. “I don't know… I don’t think I’ll make it.”

In the background, she started crying. 

“I love you,” I whispered and hung up.

Day thirteen. *I will beat you,* I thought at the sky, though *up* and *down* were no longer concepts I understood. Breathing was difficult. My heart wasn’t beating right. The world spun in dizzying circles, and dark creatures nipped at me from every side. I wasn’t going to make it through the night―that much I was sure of―until I noticed the hefty toaster oven on my counter.

I raised it above my bare, shriveled foot.

I dropped it. 

Day fourteen. Today.

The visions went away.  The pain too. It doesn’t make sense, but then again, two weeks with no sleep is uncharted territory. Perhaps, that clarity is simply what happens after some arbitrary tipping point―I suspect differently.

Ask any hospice nurse. They’ll tell you most elderly patients have a day of sentience before they pass on. The body has given up but is kind enough to gift one final chance to say goodbye. This was my chance. My daughter wouldn’t recognize me. I would attend the ceremony as a stranger, but I *would* attend.

After years of failed attempts, I pulled on my suit. I combed my overgrown beard and pulled a dress shoe onto my non-broken foot. 

For the first time in decades, I headed to that renovated barn.

\*\*\*

*Day fifteen.*

\*\*\*

I’m not even tired anymore.

I have tried to sleep, but that part of my brain has shut down now. There’s hours left. Maybe less. 

Good. This can all finally be over. I’ve lived a lifetime in the span of a day, and I’m ready to be done now. 

The voices aren’t back, but outside my house I can hear the sky laughing. Cackling. It thinks it’s won, that after years and years it’s claimed me.

“You’re wrong,” I whisper, over and over. A time loop of sorts. “You lost.”

I have been through terrible things since childhood. Unimaginable abuse you can spot easily at a glance if you knew what to look for. I have scars, broken bones, and disturbing stories to go with it. Nothing compares to this pain. I’m in another world now.

Here’s some of the things she has done:

She was an enabler to my toxic Dad.
She kicked me out after I came out, despite me being her only source of income, then seeked me out again when she needed money (or missed me as she said but never apologised) (I also get that some people are homophobic but me being In a healthy loving long term relationship is wrong vs her ex husband who beat us all and her was fine because “he’s stressed and ill”) 

I got into debt as I used to give her most my money and take care of her after my brother died. She was bedridden and grieving. My other sibling didn’t take care of her. I did. 

She verbally abused and degraded me since I could remember. 

I used to seek to talk to her and reach out to her to tell her about my day. She would mostly ignore me and get mad when I try to get her attention ( when I was a kid btw ) then got mad I’m cold and never share things with her anymore when I was older

Said I put her in a bad mental state where she had to seek therapy after I stood up for myself. She said my words were so harsh she still remembers them. 

I have several voice recordings that go from 10 minutes to 2 hours of her yelling and degrading me in the middle of the night because I upset her. Age 15-20 since as a kid I didn’t have a phone for proof.

Forced me to stay alone with my dad when I was a kid after I was terrified of him and already made plans with stay with my friend while mum would be away on holiday, but she refused. 

Fat shamed me when I was skinny and degraded my looks, while also forcing me to finish my plate even though I was full. I gained weight in my 20s as a result 

Any sign of independence and my own feelings, e.g if I didn’t want to walk with her to the store but instead wanted to get a coffee and meet up with her in half hour, she would yell at me on the street for being a brat and difficult. - I’m mentioning ridiculous fights because they make no sense and out of no where. I have anxiety and ptsd now. 

When I planned to move out and save money she would cry and open up about her past and my brother. 

Now here comes the messed up part. Last year since my wife and I finally paid off all our debt we decided to move in with my mum. I had the idea to use her save up, live there for free and then once I have enough to financially be independent, I will cut her off forever. AITA? P.s she doesn’t degrade or shout at me as like she used to since she has my wife as a witness to how she treats me. She masks and acts charming when others are present. It only happens when we’re alone.

It seriously irritates my ears and my mind. Every what she says never matches what she actually does. She’s extremely overprotective when it comes to cleanliness, food, or anything she thinks might have germs, she’s totally against it.

At first, I tried to understand. But everything changed when I came to her house. The first time I went there, I was shocked. That was the first time I’d ever seen a house that messy and horrifying. Even her car was filled with old food that hadn’t been thrown away for months.

My husband gets angry about her habits. Maybe she’s just too old to handle everything herself, since she is widow. But the crazy part is, she accused me of stealing her stuff when I visited. On top of that, even when I was just sitting down, she acted like she felt threatened by me. My husband tried to help organize the things and junk in her house, but she got furious and fought back. She kept accusing everyone around her.

Not only that, whenever we eat out, she loves to take a bunch of condiments and utensils to bring home. Even though she already has tons of cutlery at home, she still grabs things like plastic coffee stirrers. Her hobby is hoarding things until they turn into trash.

And even though she lives in our house now, she contributes nothing to cleaning. All she does is comment on how clean or dirty things are, but never lifts a hand to help. Ironically, the downstairs bathroom, which she uses the most, is dirtier than a public restroom. The edges of the toilet bowl have turned black from the filth.

Newer Fan of Death Becomes Her Musical here, and I've been kicking around some fanfiction ideas, but I want to see if there's any interest before I dive in. I'm thinking of writing a story featuring the incredible cast: Christopher Sieber, Jennifer Simard, and Megan Hilty.
I'd use a gender-neutral main character named Y/N and gender-neutral pronouns.

Here are a couple of my initial concepts:
 
* VIP Backstage Pass: Y/N wins a contest for VIP tickets to Death Becomes Her, including a backstage tour and a chance to meet the cast.

 * Joining the Cast: Y/N auditions for the musical and lands a role as an understudy or stand-in for either Helen or Madeline, getting to work alongside Megan Hilty (Madeline), Jennifer Simard (Helen), and Christopher Sieber (Ernest). 

I'm also open to other ideas! What about:

 * Casual Hangout: Y/N ends up in a situation where they get to hang out with the cast outside of the theater – maybe a quirky coffee shop encounter or a funny group dinner.

 * Unexpected Collaboration: Y/N, who might be a writer, musician, or artist, collaborates with one or more of the cast members on a project unrelated to the musical.

 * A ""What If"" Scenario: Given the magical themes of the show, what if Y/N somehow gets caught up in a Death Becomes Her-esque magical mishap with one of the cast members?

Let me know what you think of these, or if you have any other cool ideas! Your feedback will really help me decide what to write.
Thanks!

I try to make my coffee at home to ensure I’m getting decaf, but sometimes want a sweet treat at work. 

I went to Dunkin today and ordered a medium DECAF iced coffee with cream and mint chocolate chip flavoring in person. Whenever I order I make sure to ask for decaf multiple times throughout ordering, and right after I’m done paying I remind them about the decaf. 

I see the worker pour my drink from a box that has a “regular” label on it. When he hands it to me I asked if it was decaf and he said he forgot and would make me a new one. I wasn’t upset at this at all. As someone who worked in food industry I know how crazy things can get. He then went back to the same box and covered it with his body… as if I wouldn’t be able to see what he was doing? And poured from the same box. 

This is not okay, and as someone with a medical condition that requires me to drink decaf, actually really scary? Anyway, just wanted to vent on here and warn others who order decaf.

That was the question Mr Milton asked the other attendees at the biweekly bereavement support group.

I never did learn his first name—which, given how intertwined our two lives became, may seem rather odd. Given the horror that followed, of course, it makes perfect sense.

Besides, grief is a disarming thing. A thing impossible to describe. I could lie, like other sufferers, and offer a simplified explanation of the experience. Could reduce it to a mere dulling or heightening of emotions. However, it’s far more complex than that.

Grief is a vulnerability which exposes that buried side of one’s self: the Ugly. That second ego, buried in some distant nook of the mind. You might not even believe yours exists, but it does. And the right kind of trauma can unlock it.

That’s what happened to me.

It’s what happened to Mr Milton.

In answer to his question, the facilitator of the group let a deep sigh free. “Sure. I think we’ve all wanted to turn back the clock and see our loved ones again.”

Mr Milton nodded, but said nothing. He continued looking down at his twiddling thumbs.

The man was in his late forties, sporting greying hair, a slight gut, and rimmed glasses. He was what some members of the group teasingly called fat-thin. One of those sorts whose strength comes from hard labour and toil, rather than gym sets or healthy eating. Yet, in spite of his heavyset form, the man always seemed paper-thin to me. Seemed a quarter “there”, as one member once whispered to me—whilst the rest of the grievers were half “there”. Mr Milton was the worst of us.

“Does this mean you’d finally like to share with the group?” the facilitator asked. “This is your fifth appearance. You miss a few groups here and there, but I keep count. And, listen, I will always respect your right to share, but how about you start with your name?”

The man shrugged. “Mr Milton will do, Lucy.”

She smiled. “That’s fine. That’s great! It’s just nice to hear you speak. Well, Mr Milton, would you like to tell us a little bit about yourself? There’s no pressure, of course.”

Mr Milton grumbled. “I think I’d rather listen. I find it immensely helpful. Take Sara, for instance…”

My eyes widened, and I, having been stuck in an absent-minded state until that moment, tuned more attentively into the conversation.

Why did he say my name?

“Your story,” Mr Milton continued, with magnified eyes studying me. “It was so like my own. The emotions you described. The resentment. The anger. You’re just like me. And I’ve needed to find someone like that.”

Those words really didn’t sit well with me. Even written down, they seem untoward. Threatening. Yet, nobody swooped to my aid. As I said, grief is a disarming thing. We all assumed Mr Milton to simply be like us: heartbroken. He wasn’t himself. He could be forgiven for his oddities.

My gut said otherwise, and I should’ve trusted it.

I shifted uncomfortably in my seat. “Well, I’m glad my story, erm, helped.”

“I’m so sorry about your father,” Mr Milton continued softly. “Losing a parent is… I’m sorry.”

“Losing anyone is hard,” I mumbled. “Do you mind me asking who—”

“My wife,” Mr Milton hoarsely interrupted. “But that’s enough. Okay?”

Lucy nodded hurriedly, interjecting the moment our conversation risked becoming heated. “As I said before, Mr Milton, there’s no pressure to share, but I’m so glad you’ve opened up a little bit today. You’re right. Listening to others is helpful. I just want you to know that we’re here for you too.”

“That’s nice,” the man coldly whispered; his gaze still hadn’t unglued from my face, and I was starting to feel quite unsafe. “We’re all here for each other.”

I don’t know whether the other members of the group were simply unaware of Mr Milton’s sudden and alarming fascination with me, or turning a blind eye, given the nature of the group—the nature of our collective trauma. Whatever the case, for the remaining half-hour of the session, I barely focused on anything the other members of the group were saying. I looked at the floor and tried to ignore Mr Milton’s unhealthy stare.

At nine o’clock, when the session wrapped up, I hurried across the town building’s blackened car park. I rummaged in my pocket for my keys, whilst standing right outside my Nissan Micra. Standing so close to freedom. To safety, no matter how small and claustrophobic that box. Before I made it inside my vehicle, however, there came what I’d feared. What I’d predicted, thanks to the raised hairs on the back of my neck.

Pursuing footsteps. Every woman’s greatest fear.

And then…

“Wait!” yelled Mr Milton’s unmistakeably weathered, yet insistent, voice. “Sara, wait!”

I turned, despite my better judgement, and froze to the spot in terror as the wheezing man hurtled towards me. This is how I go, came that timid, and resigned, and terrified voice at the back of my mind.

Thankfully, he came to a stop about three or four feet away from me, panting heavily with hands against his knees.

“Are you okay…?” I asked weakly, thumbing the button on my car key.

I winced a little at the digital bleep, scared that it might elicit some sort of aggravated response from the man before me. That he might become angry simply because I’d been trying to run away.

But he was focusing on something else. He was a single-minded man.

“Blimey, you… move quickly,” Mr Milton spluttered. “Listen, I… wanted to ask you something…”

“I have to get home,” I choked out, fumbling with the driver’s handle behind my back.

I watched other members of the bereavement group flock to their vehicles, which settled me a little, but I was aware that the car park would soon be empty, save for Mr Milton and me. My heart was thumping in my chest. I had to escape whilst there were still people around.

The man struggled to catch his breath. “Look… I see that… you feel apprehended, but just… hear me out… Golly, I’m winded.”

“My mum’s waiting for me,” I croaked, clicking the door open.

It wasn’t a lie. I moved back home after Dad died, as I was worried about my mother living on her own. She’d been severely depressed.

Then I continued, “I’d be happy to talk during next week’s support—”

“You and your mum need what I’m offering,” Mr Milton half-barked.

I didn’t like the sound of that at all. And most frighteningly of all, not a soul in the car park seemed to notice. They hadn’t noticed my discomfort in the well-lit meeting room, so why did I expect them to notice me in an unlit car park?

And before I had a chance to respond—

“Have you ever wanted to go back in time?” Mr Milton asked softly, repeating the question from the group.

I gulped. “I’m going to get into my car now because I don’t feel comfortable. Okay?”

“Wait… Just wait… It wasn’t a rhetorical question,” the man said, hurriedly fishing around in his pocket as I lowered myself into the driver’s seat—slow and steady movements seemed safest. “Before you shut the door, take a look at this.”

I don’t know why I kept the door open. I’ve never been a curious sort—never more curious than anxious, at any rate. Yet, on this haunting night, since this strange man had set his sights on me in the meeting room, I’d felt different. Felt something awaken within me. That was the truth I hadn’t wanted to admit to myself. Below my fear, I was desperate.

Desperate to know why Mr Milton kept talking about time.

In all honesty, from the moment he asked the group that question, I’d already known the truth—that, much as he had claimed, it wasn’t rhetorical.

And when I eyed the little, metallic pebble in the man’s palm, I felt something stir and shift deep within me. Felt confirmation that I’d been right to push through the terror and give this man the time of night. I don’t know what I believed in that moment, but I didn’t shut the door. That has to mean something, I told myself. As afraid as I felt, I still reached out and took the device from his hand.

“What is it?” I whispered, wanting confirmation that my churning stomach had the right idea.

“I think you know,” he replied gently, taking a knee outside my door and bringing his face closer to my level. “You feel it, Sara. Just as I did when I took it.”

My eyes enlarged. “Took it?”

The man nodded. “Five weeks ago. I’d finally returned to the sales office from bereavement leave. I didn’t want to go back to work, but it turned out to be a blessing from the universe. You see, I spotted this object dropping out of a man’s pocket. An important man. A contractor from some…

“Well, I’m not supposed to talk about it. But I knew, somehow, that I was looking at something which would fix me. So, yes, I took it. And I need you to stop pretending, Sara. I know you want to take it too. You feel it. That’s why I chose you.”

Chose me, I internally repeated, face likely turning a ghostly white.

My fear reflex was trying to kick back into action, but I was intoxicated by the stone-like item in my palm.

Tears trickled down my cheeks. “It’s a way back.”

“Yes…” Mr Milton whispered. “I somehow understood the device just by looking at it. Just as you do now. Like it was calling to me. Like something from… time itself was calling to me. Calling me towards this thing.”

“It’s impossible,” I whispered, hand trembling as I sat in that driver’s seat, eyeing the smooth, silver stone in my hand. “Is it a piece of technology or… something else?”

The man shrugged. “I don’t know.”

“You seem to know very little,” I said.

“I know I squeezed it,” he replied, placing a hand over mine to wrap my fingers around the device. “It slowed my heart. Slowed every organ in my body. The world around me came to a crawl, then a total stop. And after a few moments of pause, the chain of time started to pull backwards. Slowly first. Then at a pace too blindingly quick to follow. Time raced a year backwards and finally slowed to a stop again. I’d reached a time at which Liv was still around.

“And, for two blissful days, time passed at a normal rate. I got to relive those hours with my darling wife. But then, to my horror, time sped up again. Days, and weeks, and months raced forwards until I returned to the present day. Five days ago. Right when I’d started.

“I call it a boomerang. It’ll fling you back in time, but you’ll always be pinged straight back to the starting point. There is no clinging to the past. The boomerang always comes home.”

I paused for a few moments, trying to listen to the logic that would refute this man’s tall tale, but I felt it. He was right. There was something in the device, or from time itself, that called to me.

“Why wouldn’t you change the past?” I asked.

The man grimaced. “Liv died of stage-four cancer six months ago, Sara. There would be no saving her even if I were to go ten or twenty years back in time. It’s an inevitability. I can only keep going back twelve months to enjoy a little more time. I may be rewriting the timeline with each trip, but I remember it all. If there were a way to beat the boomerang and stay for more than two days at a time, I would take it.”

“What do you mean? You can just keep using this forever. You’ll get to see Liv again, and again, and again,” I said, feeling my skin warm as Mr Milton held my fingers around the little pebble; I was too awestruck to feel immediate fear, but it was there—lurking beneath.

He was far too forceful about me holding onto that thing.

“I can’t keep doing this ‘forever’, Sara,” the man explained. “Look at me… My pale skin. My cracked skin. I know you’ve noticed me in the groups. I’m not well. The boomerang takes it toll on the body. We defy nature when we use it. I might only be able to survive a few more trips. Alternatively, if I could find a way to remain in the past and not be forced to make the return trip to the present day, I’d get another year with Liv. A whole year, Sara. That’s a lot of time.

“You know, I did try gaming the system, so to speak. I tried using the boomerang a second time once I’d reached the past. After bouncing from 2025 to 2024, I thought I’d be able to bounce from 2024 to 2023. Boomerang even farther back in time. But it didn’t work.”

“So, there’s no way of beating it? No way of getting more time with your wife?” I asked. “Is that why you’re giving away such a precious thing to me?”

Mr Milton smiled gently but disingenuously. “I will never give up, Sara. I just want help. Help from somebody I can trust to not steal this ‘precious thing’ from me. I suppose I want a fresh set of eyes. Maybe you’ll see something I’ve missed. Some way of spending more time with Liv.

“Of course, you’re right that taking a short break might be good for me. Maybe my body will heal. Maybe I’ll survive several more trips with the boomerang. Get more time with her.

“So, what do you say, Sara? Do you want to use it?”

“How could I say no to even a second of extra time with my dad?” I asked.

Upon my acceptance, Mr Milton became a little teary-eyed. “I’ve spent weeks looking for someone to help… You’ve made me happier than you’ll ever know, Sara. Just make sure you keep the boomerang on your person, okay? I once left it on a coffee table, and I was walloped by both a headache and severe nausea once I stepped away from it. I don’t know what would have happened if I’d kept my distance for too long. Fortunately, the symptoms abated once I rushed over and picked it back up.”

I felt my heartbeat begin to slow, and Mr Milton seemed suddenly to be speaking glacially.

Everything was moving glacially.

Including the upturning of his untrustworthy lips. “It’s happening, Sara… You’ll see your father soon. You said he died in October of 2024, right? Well, the boomerang will take you back to last June. Four months before he died. You’ll have more than enough time to see him again.”

“Maybe I’ll be able to save him…” I whispered.

Mr Milton continued smiling that salesman’s smile and nodded. “Maybe.”

And then the wheel of time finally braked. The man froze with that dreadful expression eyeballing me, and the world fell silent. The cars stopped in the road. If my heart had been capable of racing, it would have—I’ve never been so frightened. So uncertain of my own decision.

Moments later, all was reversing.

Even me.

Time ripped backwards, and I unleashed a backwards scream of horror as my own body retraced its steps. Retraced days, then weeks, then months of steps. And as the world rushed past me in an even-quickening blur, my ability to scream eventually diminished—my ability to do anything diminished. I was helpless. A rewinding video tape, aware only of pounding pain and the existential terror of losing one’s free will. I felt broken in the face of this existential power yanking me backwards through time.

I believed the trip would kill me.

“Sara?”

I had been pacing through the time-frozen living room of my parents’ house, weeping. And then I lifted my head to see an impossibility. Not only that time’s speed had returned to normal, and had started to pass forwards again, but—

“Dad…?” I whispered.

Mr Milton had been telling the truth.

It was June of 2024.

The boomerang had flung me a year backwards. Flung me to a time at which my deceased father was still alive. A man who, four months from that moment, would die in a motorway collision with a drunk driver.

After managing to convince my parents that my tears in the living room had just stemmed from a “hormonal moment”, I set my sights on the task at hand: saving my father from his fate, four months from then.

I tried to convince him to sell the car. I couldn’t think of any other way to prevent a catastrophe that would take place four months from that moment. I thought of the butterfly effect—that if he changed something as drastic as his vehicle, maybe he’d never end up on that road in October. Never be killed by that inebriated lunatic.

But Dad said his current car was fine, and that he didn’t have the money for an upgrade anyway—wouldn’t until, at the very least, the end of the year. That caused my stomach to lurch, but I told myself that even something as small as having that conversation with him might alter the course of history. Might prevent him from driving along that fatal road in twelve weeks.

Instead, I decided to cherish the time we had together. Take a page out of Mr Milton’s book. We played football in the garden, which was something that amused my mother—a twenty-something and fifty-something kicking a ball around haphazardly on the grass. And, in my defence, I could feel time starting to pull me forwards again—things were starting to move too quickly. But that was okay. I would ask Mr Milton to use the boomerang again. I would see my dad as many times as I could before I started to feel the “toll” on my body.

However, then came the nightmare that would make me swear to never turn back the clock again.

I saw him through the slats of the fence surrounding my parents’ garden. A black figure. Like a silhouette, but one that had lost its clarity around the edges—had started to fuzz and buzz with a sort of paper-cracking frequency that pained my ears. I started to whimper, and my ever-quickening father noticed.

“Upset that you’re losing?” he teased, one foot atop the ball. “I think we’re at Five-Nil to me now.”

“You’re just as bad as you were when she was a kid,” Mum scoffed. “Let her score.”

“Where would be the satisfaction in that?” Dad laughed, then he stopped when he realised that my whimpering was genuine—and he turned to follow my gaze.

“What the…” Dad whispered.

Mum screamed. “WHAT IS THAT?”

They could see him too. The buzzing, crackling, glitching silhouette beyond the fence. And he was only starting to crackle more quickly and feverishly as the time-speed of the world quickened.

Our three screams merged into tiny, high-pitched, fast squeals as the figure began to ascend the fence, moving at a frightening pace. And I, in spite of the world moving so quickly, did not seem to have a brain capable of thinking quickly enough to react—quickly enough to kick my body into action.

The black shape tore across the grass, sunlight from above not even scratching the surface of his void-like form. My dad disappeared. My mum disappeared. Everything but that thing disappeared, and I couldn’t tell what was happening. I felt the world and its colours start to merge and blur as the man approached. The last thing I saw was that blackness filling my vision.

The last thing I felt was one of its hands clawing at me, tearing through my shirt and flesh.

I screamed, this time forwards—and quickly, as days, weeks, and months raced forwards. I don’t know what I saw on that day. Don’t know how I survived it. But when I returned to the present day, one year later, I was no longer sitting in my car. I was standing outside the town building, following a bereavement session—the heartbreaking sign that I hadn’t saved my father. And Mr Milton was standing in front of me.

“You’re back…” he murmured. “That was risky. God, what a rush… I have memories of two different timelines. Two different courses of history… It must be the boomerang. Must be something it does to the people who use it.”

I was trembling as I handed the device back to him, and then I looked down at my blouse. With ginger hands, I lifted it to reveal three claw-shaped scars that had healed across my midsection.

Mr Milton’s eyes widened. “What happened to you?”

I started to blubber. “It tried to… It attacked me… Why didn’t you tell me about it?”

“It?” the man asked, puzzled.

“A silhouette,” I wheezed. “A figure… It came for me.”

His eyes took their turn to widen. “You’ve been talking about that over the past weeks.”

“What?” I whimpered.

“Whilst you were boomeranging forwards in time, I mean,” Mr Milton explained. “We may rush forwards through time, but we still live it. Still experience it. Though, perhaps only in a ghostly sense. After all, until the day I first talked to you, I’m sure I didn’t quite seem myself, did I? Not quite present, I mean.”

“Anyway, you won’t remember the new events of the past year for, oh, anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours... It takes the brain time to catch up. It’s hard to remember the things we’ve done whilst racing forwards at such speed.

“Anyway, you talked of a black shape watching you. Said that it tried to kill you in your parents’ garden, and disappeared into thin air once the boomerang started pulling you forwards. You were hazy about what happened after—“

“Wait a minute,” I interrupted. “Why is my father still dead? You implied that, even though I moved at a speed too fast to remember, I still lived through the last year, right? Well, why didn’t I do something in October to stop Dad from being killed by that driver? I had all of my memories from the future. I could’ve done something.”

“It wasn’t the driver that killed him, Sara…” Mr Milton whispered, looking down at the boomerang with something verging on shame—but then he shrugged it off. “It was that thing in the garden. On that day.“

My eyes widened, and I dropped to the floor. All of the pain rushed back to me. The grief, felt twofold from two different deaths of my father. Two timelines that I remembered.

“Why have you done this to me?” I wheezed. “I don’t ever want to see you again… And if you have any sense, you’ll destroy that boomerang. Or bury it, so nobody else is ever tempted to—“

“It didn’t just kill your father,” Mr Milton continued, eyes pooling with tears. “I’m sorry, Sara…”

And then I remembered the other horror.

Three weeks after Dad had been killed by that thing, Mum had been driven by madness—madness at not only his passing, but at seeing a force she did not understand. She had taken her own life. And I didn’t blame her. The nightmare had fractured me too.

I remembered my dad lying in a bloody pool on the grass. The silhouette had gone. Not of its own volition—Mr Milton was right that the boomerang, upon flinging me forwards, had seemed to expel the creature. Moments before it likely would’ve torn me to shreds too.

“And I’m not being forthcoming with you,” the man quietly admitted. “I’ve seen this figure too… Countless times.”

I looked up at him with eyes of rage. “You didn’t tell me. You just let me use that thing, knowing I was putting myself in danger. Knowing I might—“

“It never hurt me!” Mr Milton roared. “It just watched. Always watched. Never touched…”

“Like I said,” I began, stepping down from the town building, eyes set on my car, “I don’t ever want to see you again.”

“But your mother…” he whispered. “We’ve been talking about this for weeks. That, as soon as you’d finished boomeranging back to the present, you would go back in time. Try to save them both this time. She was never meant to die.”

“AND YOU KILLED HER!” I screamed, face stained with tears. “You came into my life two days ago, or what feels like two days ago, and you promised to bring my father back to me. Instead, you took both him and my mother away.”

“We have to try, Sara,” Mr Milton insisted, following me across the unlit car park once again. “That was what you said!”

“Why do you care?” I cried, turning to face him. “I didn’t learn anything. I didn’t find some way for you to get more time with your wife. That boomerang is going to kill you. One try was enough to nearly kill me.”

“Listen, when your memories come back to you, and you remember the months of grief over your mother, you’ll also remember that you wanted to try again,” Mr Milton said.

“Maybe that ghostly, half-present version of me wanted that,” I said. “You’re right. I saw you during the sessions. Zonked out and inhuman. And even now, when you seem fully present, you still give me the creeps. So don’t come near me ever—“

“Keep it,” Mr Milton said, thrusting the boomerang into my hand. “I’ll see you at the support group in two weeks, and we’ll talk more about how you’re feeling then.”

I wanted to thrust the device back into his hands, but the man stepped aside to let me get to my vehicle, and I wasn’t going to pass up the opportunity to finally escape from him.

I got home, collapsed in bed, and rotted away there for the entire weekend. The device sat on my bedside table, mocking me. Begging to be used again. But every glimpse of the red scarring on my stomach, whilst I showered, reminded me that the horror I’d endured was real. That I wasn’t going to let that happen ever again.

As the next two weeks went by, I focused on work and friends—focused on the hellishness of dealing with two sets of warring timelines in my head; my journey into the past had changed quite a few small things in my daily life. Dynamics within relationships, and so forth. But I still remembered the old events of the past year. I hoped those old, outdated recollections of a dead timeline would pass in time.

The worst part of this flooding of memories from the “new” timeline was that I realised Mr Milton had been telling the truth: I did have an urge to use the boomerang again. An urge to save my mother. Even after how horribly wrong it had gone with my father.

But he was meant to die, I told myself. Mum wasn’t.

And that was what spurred me to do it.

Mr Milton pulled me aside at the end of the bereavement group session, and there was a smile on his face. Even less pleasant than the first time. There was a smugness to it too.

“I knew you’d come around,” he said before I’d even spoken a word. “A couple of weeks with the boomerang is all it—“

“This will be the last time,” I warned. “I’m going to find a way to save my mother, and then I’ll never use it again. Okay? You do what you want with it, but never involve me.”

Mr Milton nodded. “Do you mind, just before you go back, letting me use it? Letting me go on another trip to see my wife?”

I frowned. “Now I’ve used the boomerang, I remember everything, don’t I? So, this time, if you change the timeline, I’ll remember the old one. Right?”

The man sighed. “Yes, Sara.”

“I’d rather not remember two… No, three different versions of the past year’s history,” I said.

He groaned. “There are only ever minuscule differences, Sara. Changing my history will hardly change yours, despite our living in the same city. Besides, the memories of slight differences in those old, overwritten timelines will fade with time. How clearly do you remember specific events from specific days five or six years ago? Just allow an old man this, won’t you?”

I’d barely handed the boomerang to him before the world shifted—cut-transitioned to me sitting in the driver’s seat of my car with Mr Milton sitting next to me.

“Jesus…” I gasped.

“Thank you,” he whispered. “It’s been a long two weeks. I needed my fix.”

I remembered a year’s worth of, as he said, minor events happening differently. But still, three different timelines from a single year? That’s a lot of overlapping and confusing information to hold in one’s head.

“Just remember that the old timelines no longer happened…” he whispered. “You’ll forget them. So, what’s your plan? How will you save your mother?”

I sniffled, eyeing the boomerang in my palm and trying to focus simply on the pitter-patter of rain against the windscreen.

“I don’t know,” I admitted. “I’ll talk to her. Tell her it’s okay… That we’ll overcome what happened to Dad, but she doesn’t need to… hurt herself.”

Mr Milton nodded. “So, you’ll go to her house and talk to her?”

I shook my head. “No, she’ll be at my flat in the city. I remember now. I moved her there after that thing killed Dad. She couldn’t… stay there after what happened to him. And I wanted to keep an eye on her. But it seems I still didn’t do enough.”

“You will this time,” the man promised. “But maybe you ought to take her somewhere to clear her head? It mustn’t be good for her to be cooped up in an inner-city apartment block.”

“I don’t know,” I sighed.

“What about the local beach?” Mr Milton asked. “The theme park has some great rides.”

I smiled. “She has always liked that place.”

“Right!” the man roared triumphantly. “Well, that’s where you’ll take her then. I’ll see you in just a moment, and everything will be back to normal. You and your mum will both be alive and well.”

I nodded, smiled, then squeezed the boomerang in my hand.

And it started again. The slowing. The stopping. The reversing. All accompanied by a throbbing headache and terror like nothing I’d ever experienced.

And then I was back in my city flat. Cuddling my despondent mother on the sofa. It took a lot of persuading to get her to go to the beach with me, but it was a lovely day in late June of 2024. A day not to be wasted, as I told her.

Being out and about with me did trigger some sort of Mum Mode—she fussed over whether I’d remembered to apply suncream. Perhaps she’d been welcoming the distraction. I knew that two days was very little time to change the mindset of a woman only a week away from taking her own life, of course, which was why I’d already started to work on my failsafe.

Before being flung back into my own time, in the present, I was going to have my mother sectioned. That would keep her safe for the next year. Surely.

I could feel my heart beating a little quicker at that prospect. The prospect of betraying my mother like that. This was how I saw it. But the root of my anxiety was deeper than that. Something was looming over me. A heavier shade of black

And as I waited for my mother outside the theme park’s toilets, something entirely unexpected happened.

“Sara!” the voice rang out from behind me.

I spun my head and widened my eyes.

It was Mr Milton.

And he knew me. Ten months before even attending the bereavement support group for the first time, this man knew me.

“It can’t be…” I whispered, realising what that meant.

The man stopped in front of me, panting. “Sara, are you okay? Do you have the boomerang?”

“What’s happening?” I asked timidly. “I… Is something wrong?”

“DO YOU HAVE IT?” he screamed.

“Yes!” I yelled, fishing the device out of my pocket in a panic, expecting him to say that all had somehow gone wrong again.

Then Mr Milton’s demeanour shifted. His hand shot forwards and plucked the device from my palm, and he smiled.

And that was when I took a closer look at him. Saw his neck, covered in gaping wounds. A thousand tiny perforations, as if he’d started to rip apart at the seams. There were similar cuts on his hands, which were cradling my boomerang lovingly.

When I thought about it, I realised that he’d been covering up his body with gloves, thick sleeves, and even a buttoned-up shirt at bereavement sessions.

“How long have you been like this…?” I whispered. “You were right. It’s killing you… And how are you even here? This is before we met.”

He smiled. “It took weeks for me to find the right kind of person. A person desperate enough to use this thing. You have to be deranged to put your body through such torture, Sara. Mentally unwell. Like us.”

“What’s happening?” I murmured. “I don’t understand.”

“Well, it seems as if the future version of me told you to come to the theme park,” he said. “And you did just that, making it easy for me to find you. Easy for me to try something new.”

Then Mr Milton dipped his hand into his pocket and produced a second boomerang. I felt my head strain. Felt the world itself strain.

These weren’t two unique objects.

It was the same boomerang.

“That’s… a paradox…” I whispered.

“I’m counting on it,” the man whispered. “Time whispers, Sara… You just have to listen. Listen to the secrets it doesn’t want us to hear.”

“What are you going to do?” I wheezed, massaging my head. “I need that back… I’m already starting to feel… off.”

“I’m sorry, Sara,” the man hissed, seeming less human with each new meeting of him. “I’m going to use them both simultaneously. And if that doesn’t work, I’ll find a way to use three. Then four. Then five. I need to confuse time itself. That is the way to beat it. This truth was spoken to me…”

“Spoken to you?” I scoffed. “You’ve gone insane.”

“I need more time with her,” Mr Milton panted. “If this works, I’ll boomerang to 2023 then back to this spot in 2024. And I’ll trick time into thinking that this day is my present. Do you understand? I won’t be sent back to 2025. Time will pass normally from this day. Right now. June, 2024. I’ll get to enjoy, at a normal speed, these last six precious months with my beautiful wife.”

“Please…” I begged, head throbbing. “Don’t take it away from me…”

But Mr Milton ignored me. And as he squeezed the two boomerangs, one in each palm, I became aware of a crackling in the air. That papery sound in my ears. Became aware of a buzzing and fuzzing around the outline of his body, which was starting to darken.

The Silhouette.

I shrieked as I contemplated what the malevolent man was going to do to me. Worse than the pain he had inflicted upon me by handing me the boomerang in the first place.

He was leaving me there.

That black shape vaporised. He became immaterial right before my eyes, slipping into some hidden crevice of the air—of reality itself.

And then, mere moments later, I felt it. The headache. The nausea. All of the symptoms Mr Milton had warned would come if I were to be too far from the device whilst, as he called it, “boomeranging”.

Again, I prepared to die.

But there are more terrifying fates than even death. Than even the crackling, silhouetted form of Mr Milton, hunting me through space and time.

My heart continued to quicken, and then began this terrifying new phase of my existence that I have come to call rubber-banding.

You see, without the boomerang in my vicinity, I did not ping back to the present day. I did not return to my normal life. Did not manage to see whether I’d saved my mother with that one lovely day at the theme park. Did not even see whether Mr Milton had ever succeeded with his attempt to trick time and get to spend six more months with his wife. Instead, there came pain more tremendous than the agony I had endured during the original boomerang trip.

The world soared past me again—there came an unfathomable blur of colour, and sound, and cramping organs, and the inability to scream, no matter how hard I tried.

When time slowed to a crawl, I found myself in some wasteland of a city. Some dystopian, uninhabited version of my home city. But what I feared more than the crumbling buildings and overgrown streets were the cut marks on my hands. Running through my flesh, just like those on Mr Milton. Time had physically torn through my flesh. And, I feared, I would become him, given enough time.

You see, the boomerang had always pushed me through time within my own body. But now, my body had clearly been removed from its time. And that horror was too much for even the universe to bear.

After a few hours of lying in the rubble of some urban tip, sobbing at the impossibility of it all, the merciless teeth of time tore through my flimsy flesh again. Punished me for my sacrilegious act against reality itself.

The world swirled, and I found myself in the distant past. In Victorian London. My hands looked bloodier. More cut. More bruised. After another few hours of skulking and hiding in some ginnel, the world shifted again.

And then I found myself here. Back in the present.

That was an hour ago. At first, I thought maybe it had all come to an end. You see, I’ve returned to the present, even without the boomerang. You’d think that would mean time would flow naturally through me once more. But I still feel that quickening of my heart. Feel that another ping to some distant time, perhaps at the heat death of the universe, lurks just around the corner.

And that terrifies me, as I won’t survive more than another round or two of rubber-banding. I’m covered in deep gashes across my body, and I think I might have some fractured ribs because I’m struggling to move.

At first, the most haunting question was: what has become of the monster who used to be Mr Milton?

I didn’t notice it as first, but I like to read Murakami, like a lot, it was reading a wild sheep chase, when I realised, whenever the characters reached out for a smoke, my hands, instinctively went to my pocket, where I took out my cigarette.. 
i was already immersed in the story, and Murakami’s worlds are full of quiet rituals, coffee, cats, long walks, strange sex, and cigarettes. His characters don’t smoke for rebellion or image. They smoke the way one turns pages. Slowly. Silently like regular people do. 
His writing is such audacious that it immerses you into the story, you start to think like the detached protagonists. 

I especially like how cigarettes kinda serve a purpose or a plot point to otherwise a very regular conversations. The act of smoking somehow makes the conversation feel real somehow. It makes me feel like a fly on the wall listening to their conversations. 
It gave me a very important writing lesson too, as my writing is very much inspired by Murakami, and he made me feel so inspired to become one, my characters I subconsciously make them do mundane tasks while having conversations.. 
helped me quite a lot..

I’m a longtime barista with management experience at small artisanal shops, and I recently took on a full-time role (at $20/hr) managing a brand-new coffee drive-thru that just opened. It’s an extension of a retail business that’s been around for 35 years, but the drive-thru itself is brand new.

Here’s the context: there was a mobile coffee business operating out of this space before we opened—just for a month—but they had a good following and did great numbers. Things didn’t work out between them and the owner, but he assumed the momentum would continue even after they left. It didn’t.

We’re now averaging maybe 25 customers a day. I’ve spent the last 4 weeks working my ass off—every day—trying to build something. I’ve pitched drink ideas, created seasonal menus, and offered marketing strategies I know from experience actually work. But the owner either says “sounds good” (and expects me to handle all of it alone) or just doesn’t engage at all. He recently cut our operating hours, which in turn cut my hours from 40 down to 25.

I took this job thinking I’d be gaining real experience that would help me eventually open my own shop. Now I’m stuck wondering if I’m wasting my time or if there’s still value in pushing forward. I don’t want to give up, but I also feel like the issue isn’t me—it’s a lack of support, vision, and realistic planning from the owner.

Has anyone been through something like this? Is it worth sticking it out to prove what I can do, or is this a red flag that I should take seriously before burning out completely?",4,1751044030.0,barista,10,1.0,False

1llz9d7,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlassChildren/comments/1llz9d7/i_am_tired/,I am tired.,"I'm the brother (16yo) of a special needs child (11yo). We're a family of three, just us and our mother who takes care of my sister for a living, it's called a personal assistant in our country. 

I love my sister dearly and I would take on the world for her, but lately she's been getting on my nerves. After 11 years of the ""she doesn't understand, you have to be patient"" comments I obviously understand that she doesn't mean to be annoying. It doesn't make me any less annoyed.

She doesn't understand the concept of being quiet. It could be any hour past midnight and she will yell her words with her entire body. And that happens very often, as her sleep schedule is super messed up. The only peace I get is when she's asleep.

I sleep in the same room as her since my room is occupied by a good friend of mine that needed a place to stay to attend highschool here since he lives in another town. If I want to go to sleep I have to leave the TV turned on to shut the lights otherwise she gets scared, I have to try and fall asleep while she's watching stuff on her iPad and talking on Roblox or whatever game she's playing, but I have to be as quiet as a mouse when she's asleep because if she wakes up she will not go back to sleep.

She can't be left alone in the apartment at all. If my mom has to go somewhere I have to stay home no matter what plans I had. 

She has a total of three ""meals"" she will eat without tantrums, and if she's hungry at any point I'm usually the one that has to make it.

She doesn't know when to stop. Even if you tell her to stop she won't unless mom tells her, and even then she'll mumble shit like ""mom's stupid"" or ""I hated you anyway"". And it makes me mad, even though she doesn't understand the effect words or actions can have.

I sometimes go to work in different towns or cities, paint walls or whatnot, just usual art stuff along with my teach and my friend. I came back like two days ago and I cannot stand my sister. 

After being able to drink my coffee and smoke a cigarette in peace in the morning, having to do that while she comes into the room every five minutes to tell me I'm ugly, or that I'm the middle child, or that I'm adopted REAAAALLY takes a toll on me.

I've been snapping at her a lot more lately, saying stuff like ""Leave me alone"", ""Stop it"", ""go away"", ""I can't now"", and I always end up feeling guilty because she really has no one else to talk to and her world is really small.

But I genuinely need a break. I need a break from the yelling and insults, from doing everything for her because mom would much rather have me do it than convince/teach her to do it herself, from being expected to have no reaction simply because she's autistic.

Yes, I'm know I'm an asshole, my sister made that very clear just 10 minutes ago.",3,1751044008.0,GlassChildren,0,1.0,False

I'm here to find someone special in my life. So if you want to just unwind, voicechat or play some games together then hit me up! 

So just a little bit about me. I love working out at the gym, bouldering, hiking and reading in my spare time. I know everyone hikes these days but I'm the modern day Bear Grylls. 

At the moment, I'm working in tech and I really enjoy the day to day challenge of trying to balance out my work along with my hobbies. I haven't really been looking for someone to date but I want to start meeting people soon.

I'm a chill guy who loves having meaningful conversations and having a good time. Also, I'm a 6'5"" athletic black guy who grew up in London so the big smoke is all I know.

Right now, I’m looking for someone I can build a real connection with. I’m open to long distance if the energy feels right, but I’d love for it to eventually lead to something in person. This could be coffee dates, museum days, getting food together, or just wandering around the city. Also, I love reading books so I'd appreciate some recommendations to read this weekend.

I want to find someone that lives in the UK ideally but if you are in Europe then hopefully we can meet this summer🤝🏽

I’m in the market for a new espresso machine and trying to find the best bang for my buck. I currently own a generic ninja and usually just drink black coffee and that was all good until I tried some good espresso drinks on a trip and now my home made coffee tastes like dirt water🥴Right now, I’m torn between two options and would love some input, especially if you’ve owned either one (or both!).

One minute he’s spilling his soul over coffee, the next he’s vanished into an existential rabbit hole with no Wi-Fi. Classic Aquarius.

One day he's calling you ""brilliant,"" the next he's disappeared into his air-sign cave for a ""mental reset.""

That emotional yo-yo routine? It messes with your peace of mind, not to mention your sleep. If you've stared at your phone more than your breakfast, hoping for one text, you’ll understand.

[Aquarius Man Secrets](https://theworldhealth.org/aquarius-man-secrets-official) promises to help you stop decoding his cryptic behavior and finally figure out what the heck is going on. Spoiler: it doesn’t involve a crystal ball or psychic hotline.

# 🛍️ Product Overview

**Category:** Astrology & Relationships → Zodiac Man Guides  
**Overall Verdict:** 4.8/5

# 📘 What Is Aquarius Man Secrets?

This digital guide by Anna Kovach is for women tangled up with an Aquarius guy and wondering if he’s a genius, a mystery, or just allergic to texting back.

The main PDF includes **relationship advice written for Aquarius men**, with no zodiac fluff—just blunt, emotional explanations.

Bonus guides cover [how to build trust](https://theworldhealth.org/aquarius-man-secrets-official) **with an Aquarius man**, rekindling interest, and even decoding his... ahem, *personal style*.

It helps explain **how an Aquarius man typically communicates**—usually with metaphors, memes, or radio silence. Somehow it all tracks once you read the guide.

It even breaks down **ways to make an Aquarius man deeply interested** without playing games or changing who you are. Honestly, the strategies felt refreshing.

# 🧠 Who Should Use It?

This is made for anyone who’s Googled: “**why an Aquarius man might start pulling away**” at 1AM. (Guilty.) You’ll get answers with zero judgment.

If you want to know **how to emotionally attract an Aquarius man** while staying sane, this guide gives you structure—and a few lightbulb moments.

It’s especially handy for spotting **signs that an Aquarius man is truly interested**, even when his behavior screams the opposite.

That said, it’s not for anyone hoping to rewrite his personality. If he’s told you love is a construct and refused to meet your dog, maybe skip the download.

# 👩‍🎨 My Friend Delilah’s Experience

So I have this friend, **Delilah**, who I met through a women's book club we both joined during one of those “I need more meaning in my life” phases.

She’s a creative writing teacher, obsessed with vintage stationery, and fully believes that astrology isn’t just real—it’s emotional science.

Naturally, she was the first person I thought of when I came across [Aquarius Man Secrets](https://theworldhealth.org/aquarius-man-secrets-official).

Delilah had been on-and-off with this Aquarius guy (an abstract painter, of course 🙄) for almost a year.

Things would be dreamy for a week—deep convos, spontaneous road trips—and then he’d disappear to “recalibrate his inner space.” No texts, no updates. Just...poof.

She devoured the guide in one weekend and kept texting me things like,

>*“OH MY GOD, this explains why he backs off every time we get emotionally close.”*

The chapter on **how to build trust with an Aquarius man** hit her the hardest. She realized she’d been pushing too much for clarity in moments where he needed room to process.

But what really turned things around? One of the **texts designed to keep an Aquarius man engaged**. She used a version of it—simple, a little mysterious—and he actually messaged her back within an hour.

That hadn't happened in *weeks*. They ended up talking for three hours that night.

The only thing she didn’t love? One of the bonus booklets felt rushed, especially the part about “getting him back.” She said it skimmed the surface a bit too quickly and could’ve gone deeper.

Still, she said it was the most accurate thing she’s read on Aquarius men—and she’s read *a lot*. Watching her go from spiraling to grounded made me take the whole thing way more seriously.

# 📣 How It Helps You Get His Attention

The guide helps you [create the kind of energy](https://theworldhealth.org/aquarius-man-secrets-official) that **mentally stimulates an Aquarius man**. Think playful, curious, and maybe just slightly mysterious.

You also learn **how to interpret an Aquarius man’s signals**, which often come in the form of oddly timed compliments or five-hour gaps between replies.

The section on **what an Aquarius man looks for in a partner** isn’t wishy-washy either. He wants someone smart, calm, and not overly clingy. Basically, your cool aunt—but younger.

If you’re already together, it shows you **how to maintain an Aquarius man's interest** without becoming the relationship police.

# 🌟 What Makes It Different

While other zodiac guides recycle platitudes, this one gets specific. You’ll explore how **Aquarius men behave in love** and what they secretly need but never ask for.

You'll also discover **ways to make an Aquarius man fall in love**—which shockingly involve fewer candlelit dinners and more oddly-timed philosophical chats.

One friend loved how it explained **what Aquarius men need in a long-term relationship**—mostly space, honesty, and someone who doesn’t panic when he goes quiet.

The guide also touches on [dealing with commitment issues](https://theworldhealth.org/aquarius-man-secrets-official) **in Aquarius men**, without suggesting manipulation or pressure.

Ever feel like your body could use a serious reset? Like a deep clean for your cells? You know, the kind of spring cleaning that leaves everything sparkling and running smoothly? Well, what if I told you your body has its own incredible, built-in recycling program- one that's vital for everything from feeling energetic to actually slowing down the aging process?

It's called **autophagy**, and it's a fascinating, often overlooked, cellular superpower. And here's where it gets really interesting: peptides, those tiny but mighty signaling molecules, are emerging as key players in helping your body kick this essential process into high gear. Let's dive in and see how we can unlock this cellular magic for better health.

## What in the World is Autophagy, Anyway?

Okay, let's break it down simply. The word ""autophagy"" literally means ""self-eating"" in Greek. Now, don't let that freak you out! It's not as gruesome as it sounds. Think of autophagy as your body's incredibly efficient cellular clean-up crew.

Essentially, it's a natural, regulated mechanism that cells use to:

* **Remove damaged or dysfunctional components**: This includes old proteins, worn-out organelles (the tiny ""organs"" within your cells), and even cellular debris.
* **Recycle those components**: Instead of just throwing them away, the cell breaks them down into their basic building blocks, which can then be reused to create new, healthy cellular parts. It's the ultimate upcycling program!
* **Generate energy**: In times of stress or nutrient deprivation, autophagy can also provide fuel by breaking down cellular material.

It's happening all the time in your body, keeping things tidy and efficient. But here's the thing: as we get older, or if we're constantly stressed or eating poorly, this process can slow down. And that's when things start to get a little... cluttered.

## Why Autophagy is Your Body's Secret Weapon

So, why should you care about this cellular clean-up process? Because a well-functioning autophagy system is absolutely fundamental for optimal health and longevity. Seriously, it's a big deal.

When autophagy is humming along nicely, it can contribute to:

* **Cellular Renewal and Rejuvenation**: By getting rid of the old and making way for the new, your cells stay young and vibrant. This is actually pretty cool- it's like a constant refresh button for your body.
* **Anti-Aging Benefits**: Less cellular ""junk"" means less inflammation and oxidative stress, both of which are big contributors to aging. Many researchers believe that boosting autophagy is a key pathway to increasing lifespan and healthspan.
* **Immune System Support**: Autophagy helps your immune cells identify and destroy pathogens, keeping you healthier.
* **Metabolic Health**: It plays a role in energy regulation and can improve insulin sensitivity.
* **Neuroprotection**: Clearing out damaged brain cells is crucial for cognitive function and protecting against neurodegenerative conditions. You might be wondering why you feel ""foggy"" sometimes- cellular clutter could be part of the picture.

Basically, if you want your body to run like a well-oiled machine, you need a robust autophagy process.

## Peptides: The Master Keys to Cellular Recycling

Now, this is where peptides enter the conversation. You know how peptides are amazing signaling molecules, right? They're like little messengers that tell your cells what to do. Well, certain peptides have shown incredible promise in influencing the pathways that regulate autophagy.

Think of it this way: your cells have a complex control panel for autophagy. While things like fasting or intense exercise can flip some switches, peptides can act as precision tools- or master keys- that specifically unlock or fine-tune certain aspects of this process.

Here's what I've learned from diving deep into this area:

* **Signaling for Cleanup**: Some peptides can interact with specific receptors or pathways within the cell that are directly involved in initiating or enhancing autophagy. They don't *do* the cleaning themselves, but they give the ""go"" signal.
* **Modulating Cellular Stress**: Autophagy is often triggered by cellular stress. Certain peptides can help manage this stress in a way that encourages a healthy autophagic response, rather than an overwhelming, damaging one.
* **Supporting Cellular Resilience**: By fostering a cleaner, more efficient cellular environment through enhanced autophagy, peptides can help your cells become more resilient to future stressors and maintain their youthful function.

It's not about forcing your body into overdrive; it's about gently nudging it toward its natural, optimal state of cellular health. In my experience, focusing on these foundational processes is where the real magic happens.

## Boosting Autophagy: Beyond Peptides (A Holistic Approach)

While peptides are incredibly exciting, it's important to remember that they work best as part of a holistic approach to health. You can also actively support your autophagy pathways through lifestyle choices. This creates a powerful synergy- combining smart lifestyle habits with targeted peptide support.

Consider incorporating these alongside any peptide regimen:

* **Intermittent Fasting**: Giving your digestive system a break often triggers autophagy. Even short fasting windows- like 12-16 hours- can be beneficial.
* **Regular Exercise**: Especially high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or strength training, can activate autophagy in muscle cells.
* **Specific Nutrients**: Compounds found in green tea, coffee, turmeric, and resveratrol (found in red grapes) have been studied for their autophagy-boosting properties.
* **Quality Sleep**: Allowing your body to rest and repair is crucial for all cellular processes, including autophagy.

We've all been there, pushing our bodies without giving them a chance to recover and clean up. This is where a balanced approach, supported by what we're learning about peptides, can really make a difference.

## Bringing It All Together: Your Autophagy Action Plan

So, what does all this mean for you? It means you have powerful tools at your disposal to support your body's incredible ability to renew itself.

1. **Understand Autophagy**: Recognize it as your body's internal recycling and rejuvenation system. It's not just a buzzword- it's a fundamental process for health.
2. **Embrace Lifestyle Factors**: Integrate intermittent fasting, regular exercise, nutrient-dense foods, and quality sleep into your routine. These are your foundational building blocks.
3. **Explore Peptides**: Consider how specific peptides, under proper guidance, could act as targeted support to enhance your body's natural autophagic pathways. They're not a magic bullet, but they can be a powerful amplifier.

The goal isn't just to live longer, but to live *better*- with more energy, clarity, and vitality.

## The Future of Feeling Fantastic

Unlocking the power of autophagy through a combination of smart lifestyle choices and the targeted support of peptides is, in my opinion, one of the most exciting frontiers in personal health. It's about empowering your cells to do what they're naturally designed to do: clean house, repair, and renew. Imagine feeling that sense of fresh starts, not just in your mind, but right down to your very cells. It's a truly transformative path to lasting wellness.",1,1751043689.0,peptidewiki,0,1.0,False

After pulling a shot and waiting for a few minutes, I started to remove the portafilter and it shot downward, sprayed some coffee grounds and knocked my shot glasses off the counter, which was quite startling!

The machine has been in storage and this was the second time using the machine (after cleaning and running a tank of water through it), which could be relevant.

I suppose the question is: **Is the machine or the operator malfunctioning?**

Maybe I just needed to release some pressure with the steam valve before removing the portafilter? But I don't recall there being so much pressure after pulling when I used this machine in the past, and videos don't show other users doing that after using the machine.

For what its worth, the coffee (which I had removed before the glasses went flying) tasted great, so the machine worked well in that regard.

1llyxxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeSpotlight/comments/1llyxxj/found_this_weird_bike_cafecoffee_shop_combo_in_la/,Found this weird bike cafe/coffee shop combo in LA that completely changed my morning routine – here's why I'm never going back to Starbucks,"Okay, so I've been living in LA for 5 years and my morning routine was absolute trash. Wake up, sit in traffic for 30 mins to get overpriced coffee, sit in more traffic to get to work, arrive already stressed. Rinse and repeat.

About 3 months ago, I decided to dust off my bike (yeah, that one gathering dust in the garage) and try riding to work. Started exploring different routes and stumbled onto this place called Spoke Bicycle Cafe in Frogtown while cruising the LA River path.

At first, I thought it was just another hipster trap. You know the type – $8 toast, baristas with attitude, Instagram walls. But I was wrong. Like, really wrong.

Here's what actually happened:

**The Good:**

* The coffee is legitimately incredible. Not ""good for a bike shop"" coffee. Like, actually better than most dedicated coffee shops
* They'll fix your bike WHILE you drink your coffee. Had a flat my second visit, they patched it for like $10 while I ate breakfast
* The location is genius – right on the bike path, so it's literally on your commute if you bike anywhere near the river
* Food is all local/organic but doesn't taste like cardboard (looking at you, Whole Foods hot bar)
* Outdoor seating by the river is actually peaceful at 7am. Who knew LA had peaceful spots?

**The Weird/Unexpected:**

* It turns into a beer garden in the evening? Still processing this but apparently they do craft beer and natural wine
* The crowd is way more diverse than I expected. Not just lycra-clad cyclists. Saw everyone from artists to families to what I'm pretty sure was a CEO having a meeting
* They rent bikes if you want to try the commute but don't own one yet
* Somehow being outside by the ""river"" (yes, I know it's concrete) is actually... nice?

**The Not-So-Great:**

* If you're not near the bike path, it's kind of a pain to get to by car
* Gets crowded on weekend mornings (but like, what doesn't in LA)
* Menu is somewhat limited compared to a full restaurant
* Prices are definitely on the ""LA premium"" side but honestly worth it for the whole experience

**What really got me:** I'm saving money despite the higher coffee prices. How? No gas, no parking fees, getting exercise instead of a gym membership I never use. Plus I actually ENJOY my morning now instead of rage-listening to podcasts in traffic.

The health thing is real too. Lost 8 pounds without trying, just from biking 20 mins each way. My energy is way better. Even my therapist noticed I'm less of a grumpy asshole (her words were nicer but you get it).

**Bottom line:** If you:

* Live anywhere near the LA River bike path
* Are tired of the soul-crushing morning commute
* Actually want to enjoy your coffee instead of mainlining it for survival
* Have been meaning to get more exercise but hate gyms

Then yeah, check this place out. But honestly, don't if you're just going to drive there for Instagram photos. The whole point is the bike + coffee + actually slowing down combo.

I found it through this [coffee shop directory site](https://addictedcoffeebar.com) (addictedcoffeebar.com) when I was researching [bike-friendly cafes](https://addictedcoffeebar.com/coffee-shop/spoke-bicycle-cafe-frogtown-los-angeles/). They had all the practical info I needed like location, vibe, price range.

Anyway, if this helps one person break out of the morning traffic nightmare, I'll feel like less of a Reddit cliché for posting about my ""life-changing coffee shop discovery"" lol.",1,1751043259.0,CoffeeSpotlight,0,1.0,False

1llyvvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidTV/comments/1llyvvw/my_journey_to_the_perfect_minimalist_btir_remote/,My Journey to the Perfect Minimalist BT/IR Remote,"Recently, I bought a Google TV streamer to connect to an old Panasonic TV. I also have an Onkyo amplifier hooked up, which left me with three remote controls cluttering my coffee table — something I absolutely hated.

I needed a single remote that could:

	1.	Support Bluetooth and be reprogrammable via Button Mapper
	2.	Include some IR buttons to control the TV and amplifier (power on/off and volume)
	3.	Offer shortcut buttons for my most-used apps
	4.	Bonus: Include a play/pause button (oddly missing on the Google TV remote)


My search initially led me to the **SofaBaton U2** — feature-rich, but too bulky and more expensive than I wanted. I kept looking and eventually found the **Boxput BPR3S PLUS BT Air Mouse**. It checked most of my boxes — especially if I was willing to map number keys to app shortcuts or play/pause. Not ideal, but close.

Then I noticed the same company made another remote that looked perfect: the **ATV3 BT Voice Remote Control**, custom-designed for their own media players. The layout, buttons — everything looked just right. I ordered it, hoping I could remap the buttons to work with my Google streamer. Unfortunately, it wasn’t compatible.

That’s when I had an idea: the two remotes shared the exact same body — only the keypads were different. So I ordered the BPR3S PLUS as well, opened both remotes, and swapped the keypads. Voilà — I had my dream remote.

Here’s how it works now:

	•	Red power button: Turns on/off the Google TV streamer and the TV via HDMI-CEC
	•	Blue power button: Turns the amplifier on/off via IR
	•	Channel +/- buttons: Control the amplifier volume
	•	Source (blue) button: Turns the TV on/off independently
	•	App shortcut buttons: Work as labeled — except the Disney+ button, which I mapped to open Kodi

Now I finally have a clean coffee table and one remote to rule them all.

The total cost about 15 EUR including shipment from AliExpress.

1llyvux,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1llyvux,[SOTC] After a year of collecting watches,"Started collecting a year ago, gave the wifey my Apple Watch Ultra when trying my best to get away from electronics. The G-Shock started the collection then took off from there. The list below will consist of my first collected watch to my most recent and why I love them.

Casio GAB2100CT-1A5: First watch of the collection, bought it cause it was the first watch I was ever introduced to for a kid. Didn’t realize the vast quantity of watches there are, but really liked the nylon band, solar charging and Bluetooth. 

Xeric NASA Apollo 15 American Automatic Interstellar: Saw this before I got into watches, thought it was a fun watch. First automatic in collection, love NASA and space so I got this at a discounted price and loved it. 

Seiko Alpinist GMT SBEJ005 JDM: First higher end watch, at least in my budget, bought it due to my love for outdoors, rock climbing, trekking and such. Saw they only had the green dial in Japan so I had it imported, luckily before the tariffs. I fell in love with the green, and gold indices; it also serves as a nod to the wifey whose favorite color is green and she loves it. This piece gets the most wrist time. 

Brew Metric - Retro dial: Wanted this watch as soon as I saw it, I’m a huge fan of coffee and when it was in stock at a discounted price. I snagged it up ASAP, not much of a fan of bracelets considering I don’t go out like that so I put it on the leather strap. Love the indicator for the timing on espresso coffee and the coffee bean logo. 

Timex Expedition Titanium Automatic (Timex.com Exclusive): My coworker showed me his Huckberry expedition and I fell in love with it. Then I saw the Timex.com Edition and wanted it even more, after my employee discount and the discounted price on Amazon I had to get it. Another watch nod to my love for the outdoors, the recycled strap was too big for my wrist so I switched it with a Barton NATO strap

Glycine Combat Sub GL0270: Wanted a diver and stumbled across the Glycine brand, after finding this time piece I had to have it. I very much prefer dark colors on just about everything, so I pull the trigger on this guy. With the dark tones, vintage look, being Swiss Made, it’s what I was looking for and couldn’t be happier. Threw it on an OEM NATO strap since the pleather one didn’t feel all that good. 

Tissot PRX 40mm: Need I’d say more? When my coworker came to me with his Ice Dial PRX I had to get one, saw this bad boy on eBay on sale then with another $100 discount and I couldn’t pass it up. Still not a fan of bracelets this one actually felt amazing, still no need to have it on unless it’s a special event I went ahead and got the leather band for it. ",4,1751043116.0,Watches,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Witty Analysis: Helsingborgs IF vs. Örgryte IS – A Tale of Two Titans (Who Also Hate Each Other)**  
Ah, the Swedish Superettan! Where the grass is always greener, the coffee is always stronger, and the football matches are… *meh*. But hey, at least this one’s not a snoozefest. Let’s dive into the chaos.

---

### The Teams: Örgryte IS vs. Helsingborgs IF

**Örgryte IS** (home team) is the “favorite” here, but let’s not get too excited. Their odds range from **1.83 to 1.91** (implied probability: **52-55%**). That’s not exactly a “sure thing” in the land of snow and saunas. They’ve shown decent form pre-break, but let’s be real: Örgryte’s “good form” is like a Swedish meatball—consistent, but not exactly thrilling.

**Helsingborgs IF** is the underdog, priced between **3.35 and 3.85** (implied probability: **26-29%**). But here’s the kicker: *historical underdog win rates in soccer are 41%*. That means the bookies are undervaluing Helsingborgs by **12-15%**. If you’re a betting wizard (and you are), this is your golden ticket.

---

### Injuries & Key Updates

* **Örgryte IS**: No major injuries reported. They’re basically the Swedish version of IKEA—reliable, but not exactly bursting with flair.
* **Helsingborgs IF**: No key absences. Their squad is as healthy as a Swede’s relationship with coffee.

---

### The Math: Expected Value (EV) & Underdog Magic

Let’s get nerdy.

* **Helsingborgs’ Implied Probability**: \~28% (average of all bookmaker odds).
* **Historical Underdog Win Rate**: 41%.
* **Split the Difference**: (28% + 41%) / 2 = **34.5%**.

Now, calculate the **Expected Value (EV)** for Helsingborgs:

* **If they win**: 34.5% chance × $3.50 payout = **$1.21**.
* **If they lose**: 65.5% chance × -$1 = **-$0.66**.
* **Total EV**: **$0.55** per $1 bet.

**Örgryte’s EV**? Near-zero. Their implied probability (\~54%) vs. historical favorites’ win rate (\~59% in soccer) gives them a **-0.03 EV**. Not worth the risk.

---

### Why Bet on Helsingborgs?

1. **Value Over Form**: Örgryte’s “good form” is just them not losing. Helsingborgs’ 41% underdog rate suggests they’re *more* likely to pull off an upset than the bookies think.
2. **EV Goldmine**: Helsingborgs offers **+55% EV**, while Örgryte’s EV is barely better than flipping a coin.
3. **The Drama**: Nothing says “Swedish drama” like an underdog storming a fortress.

---

### Final Verdict

**Best Bet**: **Helsingborgs IF** at **+350** (decimal 4.5, if you’re feeling spicy).  
**Why?** Because math, history, and the ghost of Zlatan Ibrahimović all agree: Örgryte’s “favorite” tag is a mirage. Helsingborgs is the smarter play.

**Odds to Watch**:

* **Over/Under 2.5 Goals**: Bookies favor the **Under** at **2.38**, but with Helsingborgs’ attacking spark, **Over** might be the sneaky pick.
* **Spread**: Helsingborgs is a **+0.5** underdog. If they cover, you’re a genius. If they win outright? You’re a god.

---

**TL;DR**: Örgryte’s “favorite” label is a trap. Bet on Helsingborgs. The EV is screaming, and your future self will thank you. Skål! 🍻

1llysj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1llysj9/shorting_starbucks_seems_like_free_money_right/,Shorting Starbucks seems like free money right now - here is my DD.,"Starbucks has seen their revenues shrink over their last 5 quarters consecutively, while the EPS have sunk at an even faster rate during this time. Everything I've seen suggests this trend will accelerate. 

A quick look at the balance sheet shows that the company is insolvent. Starbucks is heavily indebted and will have to borrow more as it's not even close to covering its current liabilities, and the book value is negative.

Retained earnings have been negative the last 6 years, while the dividend payout ratio has exceeded 85% and growing. Its stores in China (where they've grossly overextended their footprint) are getting killed by Luckin, and sales have been down in US as well. This is a consumer discretionary which suffers greatly in downturns (oops consumer sentiment is at 40 year lows now). And cheaper coffee alternatives are not hard to find.

The explosion of weight loss drug use doesn't bode well for Starbucks's sugary cold drinks which are the lion's share of its profits, as these medications tend to curtail cravings for sugar.

Then you also have historically high coffee prices (spiking demand in emerging markets, tariffs don't help), declining brand sentiment and consumer reviews, and a company searching for an identity under its new leadership (do they want automation? do they want their stores to be hang-out shops?) in an industry with virtually no barriers to entry. Anywhere there is a Starbucks there are numerous local mom and pop coffee shops which customers increasingly are choosing over corporate chains, and consistently have much higher reviews.



All these and this company still has the audacity to trade at a P/E double that of Google's (yeah, yeah, not an apt comparison, sue me.. it's still absurd to me).

For those of you who have a guy who youve probably just met, what happens to your self awareness all of a sudden? I'm all in favour of puppy love and it's nice to see couples all doped up on mutual dopamine. Holding hands, walking together, laughing. Nothing makes my day more than seeing an elderly couple sitting together in each other's company.

But it's these younger ones who we all know go through singledom with months of stranger danger and what will everyone think mini dramas. But then meet the Habibi of your life and is it necessary everyone around you needs to know. I'm not really talking about PDAs or mucking around.

I'm sort of talking about the everyday inconveniences you would never seriously do if you're single
 - in a library, theres a bit that says no talking or be sensitive to others working around you. But oh no..  apparently ""he's my boyfriend"" means me having to move to avoid being distracted by laughing and giggling and playing videos off phones really loud. 
 - in the gym, just hogging the machines while pretending to do a workout.  Fine, it's a gym date, whoopeedoo - he's in here every week with a different girl,  but does it have to be at inconvenience of other people's workouts. I'm not really enamoured by your musclebro as you are and I'd like to finish my sets today please.
 - in a cafe, it's actually nice to stand in a queue once in a while instead of pushing in. Or it's really irritating having to wait behind you while you have your dramatic argument with your bf and I swear I just want a coffee and the guy behind the counter wants to make money today. 
 - and on airplanes,  absolutely don't get me started on couples who ask me to move seats because at least one of you is too cheap to pay to sit together. Since why is it my problem? 

Like seriously, what happens to your situational awareness when you're so loved up? I wished I had a beard and a little stick or something and could just pretend to be an angry old uncle.  But I just don't have that nonverbal facial expression to express, please go do all this stuff elsewhere.

1llypwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1llypwp/caffeinesubstances_question/,Caffeine/substances question,"Okay so yesterday was my birthday and I took advantage of free coffee at Dutch & Starbucks. I was retrospectively counting and I was probably a little north of ten standard size coffees, counting espresso shots. 

So I know it isn’t RECOMMENDED but I’ve discussed my substance consumption w my docs (including a neurologist who travels the world for his research) and they always issue the warnings but haven’t advocated against. They usually are basically like “it isn’t recommended,” at least for caffeine/alcohol (not THC), “but you’re moderating and being cognizant so I’m not concerned.” Like they can’t encourage it but it’s never been a concern because I’m lucky and have well managed epilepsy (no seizures for 4y as of October 🥳). 

So like for me, I’ll have a drink socially (never more than two in a day, but usually one). I’ll have coffee (unless it’s a special occasion I have no more than 2 cups, but most days I don’t have any). It’s not really in the same category (because it can reduce seizures for some) but I’m also a stoner. 

So with zero judgment, what is y’all’s normal substance consumption like? I know a lot of us are stoners because it’s the safest one (for many of us at least), I know a lot of us are moderate coffee drinkers out of necessity, and I know some us can tolerate a drink or two. But where do YOU draw the lines? Will you like feel safer having a lot of caffeine if you’re also stoned (like you’re able to keep your threshold lower)? 

I’m not personally interested in trying any other stuff, but if anyone would share alleged experiences w other drugs, id be interested in that! (No judgement, j curiosity. I saw an old post years ago where a guy talked about how his c0ke habits changed post-diagnosis, and it was kinda fascinating. It j seems to be something that isn’t often discussed.)",2,1751042728.0,Epilepsy,6,1.0,False

When I’m not buried in research or pretending to understand dense textbooks, you’ll find me unwinding with a good novel or getting lost in a movie marathon—bonus points if there’s popcorn involved and you’re willing to debate which film genre is superior.



One of my favorite ways to reset is by taking long walks, especially along the peaceful path near my apartment. There’s something about the quiet, the fresh air, and the gentle rhythm of footsteps that just clears my head. If you’re into spontaneous strolls and can appreciate a scenic view (or at least tolerate my attempts at deep conversation while we walk), we’ll get along great.



I’ll admit it: I’m a bit of an old-school romantic. I believe in handwritten notes, holding doors open, and the kind of slow-burn connection you read about in classic novels. Ironically, despite my skepticism about online dating, here I am—hoping to find someone who’s also looking for something real and lasting. Life’s too short for half-hearted connections, right?



I’m looking for a serious relationship with someone who’s genuine, kind, and maybe a little bit quirky. If you consider yourself a hopeless romantic, love the idea of late-night conversations, and aren’t afraid of a little adventure (whether it’s exploring a new bookshop or getting lost in the city), then you should definitely say hi.



Let’s create our own story—one filled with laughter, meaningful moments, and maybe a few inside jokes only we’ll understand.

Newer Fan of Death Becomes Her the Musical here, and I've been kicking around some fanfiction ideas, but I want to see if there's any interest before I dive in. I'm thinking of writing a story featuring the incredible cast: Christopher Sieber, Jennifer Simard, and Megan Hilty.
I'd use a gender-neutral main character named Y/N and gender-neutral pronouns.

Here are a couple of my initial concepts:
 
* VIP Backstage Pass: Y/N wins a contest for VIP tickets to Death Becomes Her, including a backstage tour and a chance to meet the cast.

 * Joining the Cast: Y/N auditions for the musical and lands a role as an understudy or stand-in for either Helen or Madeline, getting to work alongside Megan Hilty (Madeline), Jennifer Simard (Helen), and Christopher Sieber (Ernest). 

I'm also open to other ideas! What about:

 * Casual Hangout: Y/N ends up in a situation where they get to hang out with the cast outside of the theater – maybe a quirky coffee shop encounter or a funny group dinner.

 * Unexpected Collaboration: Y/N, who might be a writer, musician, or artist, collaborates with one or more of the cast members on a project unrelated to the musical.

 * A ""What If"" Scenario: Given the magical themes of the show, what if Y/N somehow gets caught up in a Death Becomes Her-esque magical mishap with one of the cast members?

Let me know what you think of these, or if you have any other cool ideas! Your feedback will really help me decide what to write.
Thanks!

When people are watched—even by something as simple as a pair of cartoon eyes—they become nicer. More honest. More generous.  

In a UK study, researchers put up posters above an office kitchen honesty box, where people dropped coins for the milk and coffee. One week, the poster showed flowers. The next, a pair of eyes. That was it—just eyes. The result? When the eyes were watching, people paid nearly three times more than during the flower weeks.  

It doesn’t even have to be real surveillance. Just the sense that we’re being seen—by anyone, or anything—nudges us toward our better selves.

I grew up in Baltimore but live out of state and Im visiting for the week for the July 4th holiday and want to take my senior Dad in his electric wheelchair somewhere for an outing, for a meal, coffee, ice cream, to see some nature, sightsee, or go to an event, and I’m really open to ideas here! 

My father was a child growing up by Patterson park and he lived near the Washington monument in the 70s where he met my mom.  They raised us not too far out in the county but when they divorced he knew so many spots downtown that he’d bring me to, when he’d take me to dinner in the city once a week, or we’d drive somewhere to walk outside to spend time.  

He moved up north to New England years ago and retired to mountain hike and ski but his health brought him home to Baltimore last year where he now lives in a retirement community and uses a wheelchair to get around.   He was diagnosed with a rare form of ALS, called PLS and he very sadly went from hiking and skiing to almost full paralysis in a short time after losing his wife. 
He’s on a good level now, he accepts the wheelchair and enjoys zooming around the halls in the retirement home and the wheelchair can be loaded into a car and he can be helped in the car for an outing.  

He loves crab cakes so he always wants to go to Pappas or the Peppermill as they are both very accessible with a nice wide wheelchair ramp and somewhere to stash the chair.  I like Pappas, Peppermill is meh. 

I would  love to take my Dad somewhere new, or nostalgic.  I’m open to any ideas.  

I would hate to not have a plan of where to park and get stuck somewhere and have us feel frustrated or overwhelmed or be stuck in the sun for a long period of time.  

When I was a kid he used to take me walking in double rock park, he took me down the trail from Catonsville to Ellicott city, or the gunpowder river.  Then he’d want to go to corned beef row or some random El Salvadoran place in upper fells he knew of.  He really gave me well rounded experiences growing up. 

I love my Dad and I don’t get to see him enough so anything we do will be worth it.   

If this sparked anything for anyone who knows about some cool handicapped accessible places in the city or county I’d be grateful to hear your thoughts and ideas! 

Some last minute suggestions: 

He loves ice cream and gelato 

Any healing spaces that are accessible and might host a sound healing or meditation

Thanks so much! 


My Dad is actually on Reddit too and doesn’t know my username but that’s all good, if you see this Dad I love you and can’t wait to see you! 👋

I had been single for six months and really wanted to get back into dating. So, two month ago, I pulled the trigger and made a Hinge, and Tinder account. Btw I'm a 20 year old Male.

To my surprise, I do actually get matches quite regularly (3-4 a week). And I would say I vibe with about half of them.

We would talk and talk and get to know each other! (on a surface level of course). But I'm the type of dude who prefers chatting irl way more than texting. So, when I feel like we've connected quite a bit (often about after a week of chatting), I shoot my shot, and ask her out for a coffee. And very often my matches say yes! even being enthusiastic about it. It's just that they'll have to check the calendar, check their work schedule, or we actually set up a date but later on they cancel, etc.

Now here comes the cursed bit, so far, not one of my matches have ever follow through, either they go cold, ghost, or we could still be talking, but if I bring up our potential date, and ask if they have a day soon that they're available, they would always talk around it, or... just ignore it.

Just now, it happened again. I'm pretty sure this is like the tenth time this has happened. And, it is kind of demotivating. Going through the loop of having genuine romantic interest in a person but, never being able to go a step further.

So, a string of bad luck? Or could it be because of my behaviour?

I guess, what I would like to know: Is this common? If you have said yes to a date before but haven't followed through, could you share why? Or have you experienced something similar? If so, do you have advice?

Festa has allowed a whopping 20 ERs over his last 4 starts, and 4 of his last 5 trips to the mound have resulted in totals of at least 9. Today won’t be any exception – I’m on the Over to hit.

At first I was at a movie theater with a bunch of people I didn’t know. It was a local club or something. I didn’t go in at first and instead hung around the concession area before running outside and having a panic attack over the phone to him. 

I was like, “Fuck what am I going to do? Someone’s going to notice.” He told me to just go in anyway because it would be weirder not to so I did.

My name is Bernadette, and this is about how Zach and I almost lost everything, only to find it again in the most unexpected way.

We met in Chicago—one of those chance encounters that felt like it was meant to happen. It was a crisp autumn evening, and the city was buzzing with life. I had gone to a jazz bar with some friends, and there he was, sitting across the room, looking a little out of place but in the most endearing way. He had this calm presence, this warmth that drew me in even before we exchanged words. When we finally did start talking, everything just clicked. We talked about everything—life, dreams, the future. I felt like I’d known him forever.

What followed were months of pure joy. Chicago became our playground. We’d spend our weekends exploring new restaurants, taking long walks along the lakefront, and laughing over the smallest things. It was easy with Zach. Everything felt effortless, like we were writing the best chapters of our lives together. I’ve never been one for grand declarations, but I knew, deep down, that I had found my person.

Then life, as it so often does, throws us a curveball.

I was offered a job in Munich—an incredible opportunity I couldn’t turn down. Zach was supportive, of course, but we both knew what this meant. I’d be thousands of miles away, and no matter how hard we tried, it wouldn’t be the same. But we promised each other we’d make it work. We had to.

The first few weeks were… okay. We called every night, sent texts throughout the day, and tried to bridge the gap with technology. But nothing prepares you for the loneliness of being in a city where everything is foreign, where the person who used to be there for all the little moments—sharing coffee, watching sunsets—was now just a voice on the phone.

I missed him. I missed us.

Four months after I moved, Zach told me his company was relocating him to Tokyo. I remember feeling like the universe was playing some cruel joke on us. Tokyo was even farther away, and I knew the time zones and distance were only going to make things harder. Slowly, the calls became shorter, the messages less frequent. We’d try to be present for each other, but it felt like something was slipping away. It hurt. I’d lie awake at night in my Munich apartment, staring at the ceiling, wondering if we were fooling ourselves. Could love really survive this?

There was a point where I thought it was over. I didn’t want to admit it, but I could feel us drifting. Every conversation felt heavier, as if we were both waiting for the other to pull the plug. And yet, neither of us did. There was still something there, something worth fighting for, even if it was buried under the miles.

One night, after a particularly difficult conversation, I asked Zach if he still saw a future for us. He paused for a long time, and I felt my heart sink, thinking that was it. But then, softly, he said, “What if we don’t give up? What if we start over somewhere new?”

I was stunned. For the first time in months, I felt hope. We talked about it, really talked. We both wanted the same thing—to be together, to not let distance tear us apart. That’s when we came up with the idea of moving to New York City. It was bold, scary, and completely out of left field, but it was a way forward.

A few months later, we both left our respective cities and flew to New York. I remember standing at JFK, my heart pounding as I waited for him. When I finally saw him walking toward me, everything else faded away. I ran into his arms, and in that moment, it felt like no time had passed at all. All the love we thought we’d lost came rushing back.

New York became our new beginning. We found an apartment in Brooklyn, started building a life together, and every day, I’m reminded of how lucky I am that we didn’t give up. The distance nearly broke us, but it also made us stronger. It made us realize how much we mean to each other, how love is worth fighting for even when the odds seem stacked against you.

So here we are, in a city that never stops moving, but somehow we’ve found our peace. We’ve found us again.

1lly418,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lly418,From 6-Hour Meetings to 15-Minute Solutions: My AI Problem-Solving Playbook,"I keep seeing people get stuck on complex problems, spending weeks in meetings or staring at a whiteboard. Many of them are using AI, but they're using it like a fancy search engine, not a strategic partner.

**The biggest mistake is just asking the AI to ""solve my problem.""**

That's a recipe for getting a generic, surface-level answer. The real magic happens when you stop treating the AI like a mere intern and start treating it like a strategic co-processor. You don't give it the problem; you give it the problem *and* a powerful framework for thinking about it.

Human + AI isn't just about speed. It's about a higher quality of thought. You bring the context and the goals, and the AI brings near-instantaneous application of time-tested strategic models.

Here are 20 of the most effective problem-solving frameworks you can use with any major LLM (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity) today. I've included prompt templates you can adapt.

# The Frameworks: Your AI Problem-Solving Toolkit

The core idea for any of these is the same:

1. Provide the AI with your detailed problem or situation.
2. Explicitly tell it which framework to use.
3. Iterate, challenge, and refine the output.

# 1. SWOT Analysis

* **What it is:** A classic strategic tool to evaluate Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to a project or business.
* **Use it when:** You're doing business planning, evaluating a product's position in the market, or assessing a potential project.
* **Prompt Template:**Act as a business strategist. I need a comprehensive SWOT analysis for `[my company, product, or project idea]`. My business is `[briefly describe your business and its market]`. Please identify internal factors (Strengths, Weaknesses) and external factors (Opportunities, Threats), providing at least 4-5 bullet points for each quadrant.

# 2. Decision Matrix

* **What it is:** A way to compare multiple options against a set of weighted criteria. It removes emotion and helps you justify your choice quantitatively.
* **Use it when:** You're stuck between several viable options, like choosing a software vendor, picking a marketing strategy, or deciding on a new feature to build.
* **Prompt Template:**Act as a strategic consultant. I need to make a decision on `[YOUR DECISION]`. The options are: Option A: `[Describe Option A]`, Option B: `[Describe Option B]`, and Option C: `[Describe Option C]`. The key criteria are `[Criterion 1]` (Weight: 40%), `[Criterion 2]` (Weight: 30%), `[Criterion 3]` (Weight: 20%), and `[Criterion 4]` (Weight: 10%). Score each option from 1-10 on each criterion, justify the scores, and calculate the final weighted score for each. Present this in a markdown table.

# 3. Fishbone (Ishikawa) Diagram

* **What it is:** A visualization tool for mapping out all the potential causes of a specific problem, grouped into categories.
* **Use it when:** Something is consistently going wrong, and you don't know why (e.g., high customer churn, low employee morale, production delays).
* **Prompt Template:**Act as a systems analyst. We are experiencing a problem: `[Clearly state the problem]`. I want you to perform a root cause analysis using a Fishbone Diagram structure. Analyze potential causes across these categories: People, Process, Technology, Environment, and Measurement. List at least 3-4 potential causes under each category.

# 4. First Principles Thinking

* **What it is:** The practice of breaking a complex problem down into its most basic, fundamental truths and then reasoning up from there.
* **Use it when:** You're tackling a big, hairy, audacious goal or entering a field with a lot of established dogma.
* **Prompt Template:**I want to achieve `[YOUR AMBITIOUS GOAL]`. Help me think about this from First Principles. Do not make assumptions based on how existing companies operate. 1. What are the fundamental truths and core human needs related to `[the domain]`? 2. What are the absolute essential components required to satisfy those needs? 3. From this foundation, what are some novel ways we could build a solution?

# 5. SCAMPER

* **What it is:** A checklist of seven thinking approaches to help you innovate on an existing product, service, or idea. (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse).
* **Use it when:** You feel stuck in a creative rut or want to find new ways to improve something that already exists.
* **Prompt Template:**Act as an innovation consultant. My product is `[describe your product/service]`. Use the SCAMPER method to generate new ideas for improving it. Go through each of the 7 steps and provide at least two concrete ideas for each.

# 6. Pre-Mortem Analysis

* **What it is:** A powerful technique where you imagine your project has already failed spectacularly, and you work backward to figure out what could have gone wrong.
* **Use it when:** You are about to kick off a new, important project.
* **Prompt Template:**Act as a risk management expert. We are about to launch `[PROJECT NAME]`. Conduct a ""pre-mortem."" Imagine it is six months from now, and the project has been a complete disaster. Brainstorm and describe all plausible reasons for failure. Group them into categories and for each, suggest one proactive mitigation strategy we could implement today.

# 7. Six Thinking Hats

* **What it is:** A method for looking at a decision from six different perspectives, ensuring a well-rounded view.
* **Use it when:** A team is stuck in a debate, or you want to ensure you've considered a decision from all angles before committing.
* **Prompt Template:**We need to decide whether to `[make a specific decision]`. Facilitate a Six Thinking Hats exercise. Guide me through analyzing the decision from each perspective: White Hat (Facts & Data), Red Hat (Emotions & Intuition), Black Hat (Cautions & Risks), Yellow Hat (Benefits & Optimism), Green Hat (Creativity & New Ideas), and Blue Hat (Process & Next Steps).

# 8. Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys)

* **What it is:** A simple but powerful technique to drill down past symptoms to find the true root of a problem by repeatedly asking ""Why?"".
* **Use it when:** A specific, recurring problem appears, and you need to find a permanent fix, not just a patch.
* **Prompt Template:**Act as a quality-control manager. The problem is: `[e.g., ""Our e-commerce checkout page has a 50% cart abandonment rate.""]`. Guide me through a Root Cause Analysis using the ""5 Whys"" technique. Start with the problem and ask 'why' it is happening, then ask 'why' to that answer, and so on, for five levels deep to find the fundamental cause.

# 9. Force Field Analysis

* **What it is:** A method for analyzing the forces driving for and restraining a proposed change.
* **Use it when:** You are planning to implement a significant change and want to anticipate support and resistance.
* **Prompt Template:**We are planning to `[describe the proposed change, e.g., ""transition to a 4-day workweek""]`. Conduct a Force Field Analysis. In a table, list all the Driving Forces (factors pushing for the change) and all the Restraining Forces (factors holding it back). For each force, assign a score from 1 (weak) to 5 (strong).

# 10. Analogous Reasoning

* **What it is:** Solving a problem by finding a similar problem in a completely different domain and adapting its solution.
* **Use it when:** You need a truly ""out-of-the-box"" solution and conventional methods have failed.
* **Prompt Template:**My problem is `[describe your problem, e.g., ""I need to improve the flow of customers through my small coffee shop to reduce wait times""]`. Find an analogy from a completely unrelated field, like `[e.g., air traffic control, data packet routing, or ant colony optimization]`, and explain how the principles from that field could be adapted to solve my problem.

# 11. Inversion Technique

* **What it is:** Instead of thinking about how to achieve a goal, you think about what would cause the opposite result (i.e., failure) and then work to avoid those things.
* **Use it when:** The path to success is unclear, but the path to failure is easy to identify.
* **Prompt Template:**My goal is to `[e.g., ""successfully launch a new podcast and get 10,000 downloads in the first month""]`. Use the Inversion Technique. Instead of a plan for success, give me a detailed list of all the actions, behaviors, and mistakes that would absolutely guarantee this podcast fails.

# 12. Cost-Benefit Analysis

* **What it is:** A systematic process for calculating and comparing the benefits and costs of a project or decision.
* **Use it when:** You need to make a strong business case for an investment or decide if a project is financially viable.
* **Prompt Template:**I am considering `[making a decision, e.g., ""hiring two senior developers""]`. Conduct a detailed Cost-Benefit Analysis. List all the potential costs (e.g., salaries, onboarding, software licenses) and all the potential benefits (e.g., faster development, higher product quality, new features). Please quantify as much as possible and include qualitative factors as well.

# 13. Hypothesis Testing

* **What it is:** Formulating a testable statement (a hypothesis) about a situation and then designing an experiment to validate or invalidate it with data.
* **Use it when:** You have a belief about your customers or product but need to prove it before investing significant resources.
* **Prompt Template:**My belief is that `[e.g., ""our users will be more likely to upgrade if we offer a monthly payment option instead of only an annual one""]`. Turn this into a formal, testable hypothesis. Then, design a simple A/B test or experiment to validate it. Define the key metrics to track and what results would prove the hypothesis correct.

# 14. Lateral Thinking

* **What it is:** A method of solving problems through an indirect and creative approach, using reasoning that is not immediately obvious.
* **Use it when:** You are completely stuck and need to challenge your core assumptions to find a new path forward.
* **Prompt Template:**My problem is `[problem statement]`. I need some fresh ideas using Lateral Thinking. Please apply the following techniques:
   1. **Challenge Assumptions:** List the key assumptions I'm making about this problem and challenge each one.
   2. **Random Association:** Give me a random word, like ""cloud,"" and brainstorm how it might relate to my problem to spark a new idea.

# 15. Blue Ocean Strategy

* **What it is:** Creating a new, uncontested market space (""Blue Ocean"") rather than competing in an existing, crowded industry (""Red Ocean"").
* **Use it when:** You want to create a disruptive business or product that makes the competition irrelevant.
* **Prompt Template:**Act as an innovation strategist. My industry is `[e.g., the local gym market]`. Apply the Blue Ocean Strategy framework. Help me identify how I could create a new market space by eliminating, reducing, raising, and creating factors that the industry currently competes on.

# 16. OODA Loop

* **What it is:** A four-stage cycle for making decisions in fast-paced, competitive environments: Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act.
* **Use it when:** You're in a rapidly changing situation (like a product launch, a PR crisis, or a competitive response) that requires quick, iterative decisions.
* **Prompt Template:**We are facing a dynamic situation: `[describe the situation, e.g., ""our main competitor just launched a surprise feature that copies our core offering""]`. Walk me through one cycle of the OODA loop. What should we Observe? How should we Orient ourselves to this new information? What are our immediate Decision options? What Act(ion) should we take first?

# 17. TRIZ Method

* **What it is:** A problem-solving method based on the idea that most technical problems are contradictions (e.g., stronger but lighter) and there are universal principles for solving them.
* **Use it when:** You're facing a complex engineering or technical problem with conflicting requirements.
* **Prompt Template:**Act as an engineering expert. I have a technical problem: `[describe the problem and its contradiction, e.g., ""My product's packaging needs to be more durable to prevent damage, but it also needs to be cheaper to produce.""]` Apply the TRIZ method. Identify the core contradiction and suggest 3-4 of the 40 Inventive Principles that could resolve it.

# 18. Counterfactual Reasoning

* **What it is:** Exploring ""what if"" scenarios by thinking about how the present would be different if something in the past had not happened.
* **Use it when:** You want to learn from past decisions (your own or others') and understand the true impact of key events.
* **Prompt Template:**Consider the historical business decision: `[e.g., ""Yahoo's decision to not acquire Google""]`. Use Counterfactual Reasoning to explore what would likely have happened if they HAD acquired Google. What are two key lessons from this ""what if"" scenario that my business should apply today?

# 19. MECE Principle

* **What it is:** A principle for organizing information into categories that are Mutually Exclusive (no overlap) and Collectively Exhaustive (cover all possibilities).
* **Use it when:** You need to structure a complex analysis or presentation to ensure it's logical, complete, and easy to understand.
* **Prompt Template:**I need to analyze `[a complex topic, e.g., ""the key factors driving customer satisfaction for an e-commerce store""]`. Break this topic down into a clear structure that follows the MECE principle. Provide a high-level outline with at least 3-4 main categories that do not overlap and cover all major aspects.

# 20. Prototyping

* **What it is:** Building a scaled-down, testable version of a product or feature to learn quickly and cheaply before full-scale development.
* **Use it when:** You have an idea for an app, website, or physical product and want to test the concept with real users.
* **Prompt Template:**I have an idea for `[a new mobile app that helps people find local hiking trails]`. My target user is `[describe user]`. Outline a simple, low-fidelity prototype we could build to test the core concept. Describe the 3 key screens/features to include and what specific questions we want to answer by testing this prototype.

# The Master Strategy: How to Iterate

Getting the first output is just the beginning. The real value comes from the follow-up conversation.

* **Challenge the AI:** ""What are the weaknesses in the SWOT analysis you just gave me?""
* **Ask for Different Perspectives:** ""Now, redo the analysis from the perspective of a skeptical customer.""
* **Combine Frameworks:** ""Take the top 'Opportunities' from the SWOT analysis and use the SCAMPER method on them.""
* **Force Prioritization:** ""Of all the potential causes in the fishbone diagram, which 3 are the most likely?""

This iterative process transforms the AI from a simple tool into a dynamic brainstorming partner.

1lly396,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lly396,WOW! That was Fantastic 🥹,"So, I just Finished Mark Waids run of the Fantastic Four and to say I have a whole newfound love and appreciation for the founding marvel family would be a GALACTUS sized understatement. Everything worked for me in this book from the small potatoes casual writing of the family doing small stuff like going to the park or to getting coffee, or Ben And Johnnys Prank wars all in between the four keeping up with PR, or the Reinventing and reintroduction of Doctor Doom using Dark Magic to Combat Reeds mind and in turn Reed Taking EVERYTHING from Victor. Waid really does take the family to places I never thought they’d go and writes the family in mature and inventive ways I would never think to like taking the four to literal HEAVEN or Johnny becoming more responsible even becoming a Herald of the big G man himself (Galactus) and if we’re on the topic of that guy Mark Waid humanized Galen and made me think about the man behind the big purple helmet in ways I never have and that goes for every concept in this book. If you’re wanting or needing a place to start getting into the adventures of the First Four well this would be the perfect place to start in my humble opinion, a lot of folks will say Hickmans to start but trust me if you want to feel whole and have your heart filled before Hickmans fun tears it out this is where you hop in.
