1gtsj52,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gtsj52/man_intentionally_insulted_merepeatedly/,Man intentionally insulted me—repeatedly,"A few weeks ago, I (29F) went on… well, a pretty rough date with a guy (20s M). First, he gave me no notice and asked to meet that same day since that was the only time he was free, so that left me with no chance to change, get ready, put on makeup, or anything. I made the best of it, imagining he’d be understanding given he was the one who asked for the last-minute date. Spoiler: he wasn't.

I wasn’t that keen on going, really, especially because it was last-minute and I don't like plans I can't *plan* for. He’d put in his profile he was looking for friends, though, so that helped keep the pressure off because he was, well... hard company to enjoy being around. I’ve never had such a stunted, dry, low-effort conversation from the other party in my life. It was like talking to a wall, very forced, almost painful. He also showed up with a ball of snot on his face and some stains on his shirt, which I was courteous enough not to point out at the time, and that was that. He also didn’t even offer to pay, which seemed odd given how keen he seemed to meet up. The date was… bad, honestly. Not the worst date I've been on, but probably top 5. I knew I wasn’t planning to see him again romantically, he hadn't indicated he'd found me unattractive (I mean, I'm not sure why that wouldn't have come up between the six recent/full body pics and video on my profile) and so we mutually agreed on that and there we were.

Pretty recently, I’ve started therapy again to work through my experience as a child rape survivor and to try and be empowered in my sexuality. Part of that means unlearning this weird inner hatred I had of my sexuality and this unfounded hatred of hookups or casual flings. When I was honest with myself in my third or fourth session with this therapist, I realized I ONLY want casual. That’s part of what’s been holding me back—I realized I was saving sex for the confines of a relationship, but I don’t actually want a relationship right now and so I was becoming increasingly sexually frustrated. So, I started feeling freer in my sexuality these last couple of weeks, expressing myself if I wanted something, and it’s made me happier than I think I’ve ever been. I’ve made out with some people, I’ve done… other stuff with some people. No full PIV sex, but I’m enjoying the ride for now.

So, I was crossfaded last night and was straight-up with this guy: I wasn’t into him and knew I wouldn’t catch feelings, and I knew he wasn't interested in me as a romantic partner specifically (again, he'd said nothing about attraction), but I liked that he had a long tongue (I am human) and maybe we could have some fun if he was down. I also shared that, since we were acquainted, I felt safe enough to just be vulnerable about why—like that I’m an SA survivor and it’s about empowering myself and taking control. And this man kicked me while I was down.

ALL he had to say was he didn’t want to, and I was fine with that. I said ok, no worries. In any case, I redownloaded Tinder and had a taker within 20 minutes. But my god, he kept coming back and digging himself deeper. It wasn't enough to leave it there; he'd come back with another message, despite me asking him to stop. It was like “and another thing!!!” but under the guise of being “helpful” in my search for a hookup. I’m gonna be so absolutely for real: I have DD cups and have not had an empty inbox because of that since I was a minor; finding a taker was not an issue and we had a nice time today. But he talked down to me like I was some ugly desperate dweeb girl who was super into him and those deep amorous feelings were unrequited. Even though that was the complete opposite of what I actually said—that he was convenient, easier because I knew him, and I exclusively wanted him for a one-night fling. 

What gets me is that I had that moment of vulnerability because I trusted him to handle that delicately or at least with a modicum of tact, and he instead went out of his way to call me ugly and say he wasn’t attracted to me (when, again, just ""no, but thanks"" would have sufficed). He suggested I didn’t put enough effort into my appearance on this coffee date (the coffee date I didn’t have time to get ready for, mind you), and how he didn’t approve of situationships or casual sex—like he was implying it was bad or that *I* was bad or lesser for pursuing that. And he just KEPT coming back with subtle digs, and I’d call him on it and tell him how disrespectful he was being, and he’d just be like “yeah, I am” like it was nothing. Truly, I do not think I have ever interacted with a less empathetic or conversational human.

It was just so cruel for absolutely no reason—and I guess that’s what it is. I’m baffled that there are human beings on this earth who actually have so little regard for others that they would see moments of vulnerability, recognize them for what they were, and then repeatedly sneak in digs that they know will make that other person feel worse. Like, I am autistic and I was under the influence of two substances, and even I could read the room. I kept trying to let him backpedal, like saying I was uncomfortable or not wanting to continue the conversation if he was going to behave that way, and he would not shut up until I blocked him.

Like, just say no. I did not need a detailed explanation. I did not ask for a detailed explanation.  I just hope the next time I'm forced to be in proximity with this guy on campus, he knows better than to start running his mouth again. 

TL;DR: guy I asked for a hookup repeatedly insulted me for no reason",1,1731891032.0,dating,2,1.0,False

ENTJ- Relatively Rare, Project Managers, when decisions are made, they figure out how to actually do it.   
Safety Mechanism: They can reallocate workers and resources to fulfill the Trajectory Decision.  
ENFJ- Resource Management, Judges  
Safety Mechanism: They get to shoot one person every decade, they must publicly state why, and they get a cool gun that everyone identifies as an execution weapon so they know to clear out.  However, if an ENFJ uses it unwisely, another ENFJ might kill them.  This averages to 1 more death per hundred people every 2 years.  This is fine.  
ESFJ- Care infrastructure, that’s a pretty big thing, so they can all just do this.  
Safety Mechanism: Manage health services, and other requirements of life.  
ESTJ- Manage ISTJs, and projects.  
Safety Mechanism: They get a ruler.  They’re allowed to hit you 3 times a day with it.  Do your job.  
ENTP- They’re responsible for organizing INTP knowledge. They make arguments for doing things a smarter way.   
Safety Mechanism: Everyone gets an RFID lanyard.  ENTPs can scan it, and then make you at least listen to them for 5 minutes unless there is an emergency.  A lanyard can only be scanned once a day.  
ENFP- We give them a stipend of resources, and tell them to make society marginally nicer.  They’ll eventually use it correctly, and in using it irresponsibly, knows what makes life more enjoyable.  
Safety Mechanism: Veto ISTJ Veto, for when a scary change actually should happen.  
ESFP- They are assistants to ISTJs and ENFPs.   
Safety Mechanism: They get additional resources, to go party and make life less boring for everyone else.  If no one else knows what to do with excess resources, they’ll find an entertaining way to use them.  One power doesn’t actually have a legal basis, but it’s that they can decide something is socially acceptable for a day.  
ESTP- Police, you don’t really need police to care about their feelings. They’ll only bother arresting people when it matters.  
Safety Mechanism: Police.  
INTJ-  They do research, and manage long term projects.  
Safety Mechanism: Use government stipend to build massive infrastructure investments.  They can recruit ENTJs towards this task.   
INFJ- Relatively Rare, they can access any knowledge base, for use in creating the trajectory decision.  Societal Requirements: All INFJs must read the top 5 books of every group.  To be updated every 3 years.  80 books required.  This is reasonable, and is being stated as such so the other infjs have to admit that it is reasonable.  Safety Mechanism: It must be done:INFJs with ⅔ Majority make the societal trajectory decision, they can adjust decisions by 10% of the vote, if it aligns with the trajectory.   
ISFJ- Facing service roles.  Bakers, coffee shops, etc.  For creating relaxing third places in society.  Front facing government positions, because they can communicate.  
Safety Mechanism: They always get a middle lifestyle.  If they want to start some service that helps others, they should just be given the resources to do so.  You don’t really need to worry about ISFJs  
.ISTJ- Bulk of society, keeping things running that would be problematic if done wrong.  
Safety Mechanism: Veto changes. With a 60% vote.  
INTP- We put them all in one place.  We create a giant research center, and leave them there.  No one can post to their internet but them.  We can all read it though, so we can use their science.   
Safety Mechanism: Just Test It: with a 50% majority, the INTJs have to figure out how to do the test the INTPs want.  This can scale up to a small town.  
INFP- Service workers, and you put one where you want a new self insert isekai written about.  
Safety Mechanism: They always have what is considered a middle lifestyle.  This way votes don’t negatively affect them much.  
ISFP- Wildlife wardens.  Plenty of time to paint in the firewatch towers, and they get to tell other people to keep things nice.  And interact with animals.   
Safety Mechanism: They can ignore minor crimes.  
ISTP- We give them a workshop, and there’s a contract list of things to build.   
Safety Mechanism: They have a workshop.  No one wants to risk a killdozer.",2,1731890866.0,mbtimemes,1,1.0,False

i'm a 22 yo female, 159 cm, and currently weigh 50 kg. long story coming! please bear with me! earlier this year i moved to the US for an internship and suddenly i gained around 4 kgs to 54 kg, which i think was the heaviest i had ever been. i usually weigh around 48-50 kg. i think i gained weight so rapidly because of all the different varieties of foods i tried when i first arrived here, and plus, the american food portions are so huge compared to what i usually had back home! i started panicking because of my weight, and started trying different types of diet, such as IF, OMAD, etc, but none worked because my weight wouldn't budge. i was always stuck at 53-54 kg no matter how hard i tried. my goal was to lose my weight back to 47-48 kg. then, i started to really count and track my calories, and that was where things started to slowly change. i work in a kitchen, 5 days a week, with an 8 hour shift each day. my kitchen job is rough, i move a lot, carry a lot of heavy things, and i get no lunch breaks. so i like to consider myself pretty active daily. i also try to incorporate easy, light arm / ab workouts in the gym 2-3x a week when i have some remaining energy. i used to do lots of cardio on the treadmill too, but i stopped doing it because i felt like i had enough cardio from my shift (my daily step count would range from 8k-12k per day because of my shift). i started doing intense calorie counting since the end of june, and by september, i had successfully reached 49-50 kg. but then things got stuck. there was one point where i had reached 48-49 kg, but it only lasted for a few days, then i was back up to 49 kg. during those days of dieting, i only ate one proper meal per day, which was dinner (i cook my own meal at home), because i usually can't eat comfortably during my shift as it's always so busy, so i prefer to just eat at home. aside from that, i was also really scared of eating more than once, because i was always thinking of my calorie intake. but then, since i was hitting a plateau, i started to desperately look for answers online, and most of the info i got suggested that my body was in ""starvation mode"" due to it being in a calorie deficit for too long. the solution i got was to increase my calorie intake to reset my metabolism, whilst still consuming healthy nutritious foods. mind you, throughout my whole weight loss journey, i kept on practicing whole, nutritious foods. i would prepare my own dinner with lean protein such as chicken, shrimp, fish, beef, pork loin, turkey, tofu, etc, and always pair it with veggies. i'd choose whole grain carbs in a lower portion, such as whole wheat pasta, quinoa, etc. my dinner would usually range from around 730-760 calories in total. i had also completely avoided junk foods, sugary drinks, sugary desserts, and would opt for unsweetened greek yogurt, granola, nuts, and/or dark chocolate for dessert instead. i can't even remember the last time i had instant noodles... fried chicken.. burgers... starbucks frapp... :/ so then, starting 2 weeks ago, i began incorporating light breakfast to my daily food log, to increase my intake and also to slowly rebuild a healthier relationship with food. i really don't want to be ""scared"" of eating, because in the past, it had reached to the point where i would skip eating the entire day if i knew i would be going out to eat dinner with my friends. little snacks would scare me, even having a sip of coffee/milk would terrify me too. i still practice IF to limit my calorie intake (plus, it helps me curb down snacking), so i would start eating at 1/2 PM after my shift ends, and eat my dinner at 5-6 PM. these days, to break my fast, i would make myself a small fruit bowl at work, which usually has 3 tbsp of greek yogurt, 4-5 tbsp of mixed fruits, and 2 tbsp of nut granola. sometimes i would also have 2-3 small pieces of crackers, or a few bites of roasted veggies i could find in the kitchen. then for dinner, i would cook the same. i also started doing workouts more consistently, adding more variations of ab / shoulder workouts to my routine. i also recently tried a pilates class for the first time. but after implementing this new routine, i gained weight.. back to 50 kg, even closing in to 51 kg this morning. this is really demotivating and stressing me out, because i feel like i have been following every guide thoroughly. i exercise, keep my body active even during my day off, eat healthy, mind my portion, eat intuitively, etc, but why am i gaining weight instead? why am i not seeing any changes? i don't feel like i'm getting inches smaller, or anything like that. is it possible that i am still not in a calorie deficit? what should i do to get through this frustrating plateau? i just want to lose 2-3 kgs more.. i feel like it's not a big number to lose for some people, but why is it so hard for me? is it possible that it's related to stress? because it's true that i've been under a lot of stress and pressure from work, for months now. please, somebody, enlighten me!",1,1731890657.0,WeightLossAdvice,0,1.0,False

I tried commenting to give a little context but I've lived in the middle of nowhere all my life so please forgive me for not really knowing how this stuff works. 

My grandmother passed not long ago, before I could get any concrete answers. I do feel that her passing was my fault in some way. That I had somehow caused something to happen, like I gave her unneeded stress or something.

My grandmother took a bad fall just before she passed, she said she had been getting something from her attic and slipped on the ladder coming down. She had fallen a couple times in the past and always recovered fast so I didn't take it very seriously at first, but I think the combination of old age and the surgery was just too much for her to handle. Her health declined fast, every time I saw her she looked worse.

I was in my first year of college when she took that fall. I started to stay with her when she was released from the hospital and able to go back home, luckily my professors were understanding and emailed me the lectures and any work I was missing. She actually accepted using a wheelchair for once, so I moved the majority of her things from her bedroom upstairs to the spare room on the ground floor. Not only would she not be able to get up the stairs but her house was hard to traverse even while being able to walk, all the halls upstairs seemed too tight, I don't know who built the place but they must have messed up on measuring things. 

The box she had been getting from the attic was still dumped on the floor from her fall. I had seen it when I first arrived and was gathering things from upstairs. I had thought that nothing of it at the time, but I gathered everything back into the box and brought it downstairs with the things from my grandmother's bedroom.

My grandmother never wanted to eat after she had her surgery, at first she said it was just because she hated the food at the hospital. But even when she was home she still struggled to eat. I had resorted to making her soup, thinking that it would be easier if she could drink the majority of it, but it still went cold on her bedside table like everything else.

I wanted to ask her about the night I woke up at the creek again, I had been putting it off since I arrived. I didn't want to put too much stress on her with the state she was in. But I, selfishly, wanted answers.

“Grandma?” 

For a moment I didn't think she heard me.

“Yes?” Her voice sounded hoarse, as if she hadn't spoken in days.

“Do you still remember when I was a kid. When I uh, when I ended up at the creek?”

""Yes, I do... Don't worry yourself over things like that.""

""How can I not worry though? All of it was so weird. From waking up by the creek to that guy showing up, it feels like it was all some dream.""

There was a moment of silence, my grandmother staring up at her ceiling in a way that let me know she was deep in thought.

“That man.” She said, “That man…”

""That man is the devil himself. He is great and beautiful but he is not kind. He is not just and he is not fair! He is malicious and hateful like the rest of mankind. No matter what he says, he is the same as you and I.""

“You’re… I don’t get what you're saying.”

“I know honey, I know. You don’t need to understand. He won't hurt you, that I’m sure of. However, he has a love for harming others. The ones you’re close to.”

“What?”

“Did your mother ever tell you what happened to your father?”

I felt like it was all getting a bit ridiculous. My grandmother had told me that she had an active imagination when she was younger, and she was a published author at one point, but it felt like she was just spinning me stories instead of actually answering me.

“She said he shot himself in on a hunting trip.”

“No… I met the man, as foolish as he was, he was not the type to take his own life on purpose or by accident. He was made to be a party favor. The main attraction is a twisted celebration of your birth.” 

“You say that like it’s a fact… How can you know if you weren't there?”

“I’ve witnessed it before. Your father wasn't his first victim and I’m sure he won't be the last.”

The whole conversation was pissing me off at that point. It was obvious to me that she was just making up some story to make things more interesting instead of just actually telling me what happened. But still, I felt a bit bad for getting upset in the first place. Her mental health was probably deteriorating along with her physical health. It was possible that she thought what she was telling me was the truth.

“You should get some rest. I’ll leave your food here in case you get hungry.”

I left the room before she could say anything. I didn't want to keep talking about it if she was just going to keep making things up. 

I wandered through the house as if I didn't know it already. It took me a while to calm down enough to decide to do anything productive. The stack of dishes I had made in my grandmother's sink made me feel guilty, she always kept things tidy, even though her house was always cluttered it was never actually dirty. 

The awning window above her sink gave me a nice view of the yard while I worked to clean up my own mess. It faced the back of the house, letting me see the well and the tree line just past it. The forest wasn't part of her property but I didn't know who it belonged to. It probably belonged to the state, but I could never find anything saying that it was a part of a park or any marked hiking trails.

I couldn't see anything beyond the tree line. It wasn't too far from the house, but it was like looking into murky water. I could see the first line of trees but not the ones behind them. Whatever was behind them was swallowed by the darkness of the forest even though the sun was still out. It was beginning to set, but it was still well lit outside, a warm gold hue making everything seem slightly orange. 

Once I finished the dishes I checked on my grandmother, made sure she was sleeping, and decided that I would go to the creek myself. It was getting dark at that point, so I had to find a flashlight to take with me. My grandmother had a surprising amount of dead flashlights, but a severe lack of batteries. It took me about 20 minutes to find a pair of batteries that weren't dead, but I wasn't sure how much charge the ones I had decided to use even had.

The air outside was still almost unbearably warm despite it almost being night, and for a moment I wondered if I should just put all this off until tomorrow. By the time I finished trying to decide if I would wait I was at the tree line, looking into the trees that still seemed far too dark.

Standing in front of those trees made me feel like I was a kid again, the trees still towing over me, the branches and leaves acting as a canopy to block out anything that would come from above. I held the flashlight tightly, my thumb rubbing over the rubber button. My palms felt sweaty, my stomach twisting in a way that made me think I might throw up. I took a deep breath and held it, reminding myself that the only reason I was scared now was because of how scared I was as a kid. I exhaled slowly, pointing the flashlight towards the trees and turning it on. The now illuminated deeper forest calmed me some. Now it wasn't some ominous inky blackness, but just a regular forest. 

The forest was denser than I remembered, and far harder to traverse. With every step I had to keep an eye on where I was walking to make sure I wouldn't trip on a root or fallen branch. Even with my flashlight it was hard to see where I was going, every tree seemed to move to block my path so I had to move around them and hope I wouldn't end up lost. It had been a long time since I went to the creek, and while I was confident before that I would have no issues finding it, I was starting to lose that confidence the further I went. 

I wasn't sure how long I had been walking for; I lost track after about thirty minutes, but after a while I noticed the beam of my flashlight starting to dim. It wasn't anything dramatic, but it was enough to make me notice after shining the light on a tree and staring at it for a few minutes. I smacked my hand on the back of the flashlight, the light flickering a few times before turning off altogether.

“Shit.”

I took the batteries out of the flashlight and put them back in, it seemed to do the trick. The light came back on and was slightly brighter than it was before, it dim, but it was better than nothing.

Dealing with the flashlight made me realize just how dumb all of it was. What was I even expecting to find? I had been walking for who knows how long and hadn't even found anything, I probably just went in circles instead of getting any closer to that damn creek. 

My thoughts were interrupted by a distant but joyful laugh. It could have been campers, or some dumb kids out here getting drunk. I followed the sound, hoping that I would find the people and they could get me out of here. I was already lost at that point, going deeper wouldn't hurt my situation. The flashlight shut off again while I was walking but I didn't try to fix it, it was likely that the batteries were dead, and the voice was loud enough at that point to where I could tell where it was coming from even in the dark. It was multiple voices, laughing and full of life, definitely some stupid kids.

The voices got louder and grew in number the closer I got. A light started to shine through the dense trees. I had heard of some people having bonfires when they got drunk in the middle of nowhere, but I haven't ever been to one.

I had made it to where I thought the voices were originating from. They had either found or made a clearing in the woods, a large circle of flat-ground with one large oak in the center. It was a bonfire, multiple piles of wood stacked and lit to provide an almost blinding light. They didn't notice me, too caught up in their fun to notice anything going on around them. 

There were maybe thirty people. Men and women shirtless and joined at the hands, pulling at each other in an almost violent manner. I recognized some of them, the gas station clerk, the bookstore owner, and multiple people from the church in the center of town. But some had their features obscured by a deep red paint that had caked to their skin. The tree at the center of their clearing was old and tall. A stag had been hung from the tree by his antlers, his back legs bent in a way to wrap around the trunk, his front legs tied to the branches so they were open and wide like someone waiting for a hug. The animal had been cut from his throat to his hind quarters, his guts laying in a pile underneath him. The animals glazed eyes stared at the hideously grinning people in front of him.

I stood frozen at the base of the trees. The people ahead of me paid no mind to their intruder, they danced and laughed. My unblinking eyes burned while I watched them, my throat stinging and dry despite the small amount of saliva I could feel dripping from my slack jaw. The blood rushed through my veins, simultaneously creating a deafening ringing and the feeling that I was being held under water. 

Then someone said my name. Faint and distant, but loud, like someone was calling for me a few yards away. 

I held my breath, waiting to hear it again. But the sound of the people and my own body made it impossible. Every sound I heard was overwhelmingly loud, threatening to burst my eardrums with every passing second.

Then it came again, closer. I could almost feel its putrid breath breathing down my neck, a heavy and overwhelming force weighing on my back. I flung myself forward, crumpling on the ground instead of actually jumping away from what was behind me like I had hoped. I scrambled to my feet, swinging my arm and the flashlight when I turned around. If anyone had actually been there then I would have hit them, but no one was there, there was nothing but the trees. 

My outburst caught the attention of the people, the silence was worse than whatever party they were having. They looked just as surprised to see me as I was to see them. They stared at me like I was the one who had done something wrong. Like I was the one who was acting insane. Like I wasn't meant to be there. I wasn't meant to be there. I wasn't meant to know what they were doing, no one was. This was meant to be a secret between only them and whatever malignant god encouraged them.

“Lucy. Sweetie…” A woman spoke to me but I could barely hear her, everything sounded muffled and faint. Her face was familiar, I had seen her multiple times when I would go to church with my mom, I had played with her kids when I was young. She walked towards me like she was trying to console a child, her hands reaching towards me. She came  too close too fast. She spoke to me in a soothing way, but I don’t know what she actually said. My hands came in contact with her shoulders before I could actually think about what I was doing, knocking her to the ground and leaving her looking shocked at me. 

I didn’t stay to see what she or any of the others would do at that point. I turned and ran, doing my best to stay on a straight course. I tripped on my way, slamming into the ground hard enough to blur my vision and make my nose feel clogged. My legs felt numb. I could hear noises behind me, leaves crunching, twigs snapping, heavy footfalls against the compacted dirt. Nothing was visible behind me when I looked, it was too dark to see anything, not even the moon gave any light through the solid canopy of trees. Could they see me?

Getting to my feet was easier than anticipated, but getting moving again felt impossible. My left leg didn't want to bend, it didn't hurt, but it felt cold. Dirt fell from my mouth while I tried to keep moving forward. I spit once, swallowed, and spit again. I couldn't hear them. 

The ground was at a decline, making it easier to gain speed. There was a breach in the trees ahead, a sickening white glow shining through. It was like an oasis.

It was a gas station. A truck pulled away from one of the pumps, flooring it onto the road and screeching to a halt a few feet away from me. The driver didn't get out, but they stayed where they were until I had completely crossed the road. 

“Welcome to Qui - OH FUCK.”

The greasy faced guy behind the counter wouldn't say anything when I tried to tell him what happened. It felt like he was ignoring everything coming out of my mouth, could he not hear me? Granted I think he may have been just shocked and confused. He did call the police, giving me the phone instead of trying to reiterate anything that I had told him. The dispatcher sounded just as apathetic, the sound of her rolling her eyes was almost loud enough to come through the phone. But she did send someone. A rotund and haggard looking officer who took an hour to arrive.

He was nice. The officer didn't ask me any questions, didn't even bat an eye when I asked if he was planning to look for the people in the woods. He demanded I get in the back of his cruiser with a kind of pathetic sort of intimidation. I did what he said against my better judgment though. I thought that he was going to take me to a station or something. But instead he drove me back to my grandmother’s house. I didn't even need to give him directions. 

He pulled into her driveway, leaving the car on and telling me to get out. I did. He pulled out before I had the chance to finish swinging the door closed, disappearing off down the road to god knows where.

The front door was unlocked, the lights still on in some rooms. The house seemed empty and silent, my grandmother was still in her bed where I had left her. Nothing looked like it had been touched or moved, but I made sure every door and window was locked regardless. 

My leg felt hot, a sharp pain starting in the middle of my thigh and shooting down to the bottom of my foot made it hard to walk. The cut wasn't too deep, but it was long, nothing I couldn't take care of with gauze and neosporin. Maybe some ice if it started swelling. 

I never checked the time when I came in. I had sat on the couch and propped my leg up on the coffee table, it was just barely starting to be light out. A faint baby blue started to coat the sky just above the tree line that was visible from the bay window. 

The house felt empty. I knew I was in it, and I knew my grandmother was in it. But I still couldn't shake that feeling. The sun rose completely, shining a blinding light through the window for a few hours before moving on. The house was empty. There were birds bathing in the fountain outside of the window. I had helped my grandmother set it up. The sun started to set, casting light in from the other side of the house. The shadows it made didn't look familiar.

It was almost dark. My grandmother had not gotten up. She hadn't made a sound. But I don't think I ever checked on her.",1,1731890217.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False
1gts8zc,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrucker/comments/1gts8zc/star_trucker_themed_movie_by_chatgpt/,Star trucker themed movie by ChatGPT ,"Title: Cosmic Haul
Genre: Sci-Fi/Adventure/Drama
Tagline: “When the load is light-years away, the drive gets heavy.”

Opening Scene

EXT. DEEP SPACE – A MASSIVE FREIGHTER SHIP DRIFTS THROUGH A STAR-LIT VOID

The camera pans over a starship resembling a futuristic semi-truck: chrome-plated, massive boosters on the rear, a cab loaded with lights and decals reading “Star Hauler: Proud Member of the Galactic Freight Guild.”

A gravelly voice comes over the radio.

RADIO DISPATCHER (V.O.)
(through static)
“Big Rig Gamma-47, you’re cleared to haul the load to Kepler-22B. Watch out for rogue debris in Sector 5. Dispatch out.”

INT. CAB OF THE STAR FREIGHTER – NIGHT (Though “night” is relative in space.)

JACK “ROCKET” RYDER (40s), a rugged, world-weary space trucker with a scruffy beard, leans back in his captain’s chair. His cab is cluttered with old coffee cups, a worn holo-photo of a family, and a bobblehead of an old Earth-style semi-truck.

His AI co-pilot, LUCY, a small hovering orb with a holographic face, glows to life.

LUCY
(cheerful but sarcastic)
“Rogue debris. Great. Because dodging asteroids wasn’t already part of the job.”

JACK
(gruff)
“Quit your yappin’, Lucy. Let’s just get this haul done. I’ve got a delivery bonus ridin’ on this one.”

LUCY
(snickering)
“As if credits will fix your rust bucket of a ship.”

Jack smirks, flips a few switches, and the engines hum to life, sending the freighter barreling through the void.

ACT 1: THE JOB

INT. GALACTIC FREIGHT HUB – LOADING BAY

Jack supervises a group of droids loading massive containers onto his ship. Each container bears the logo of SolCorp Industries. A shadowy figure, GARTH KALLEN, a corporate overseer, approaches.

GARTH
“Ryder. This shipment’s top priority. Keep it off the scanners. No questions, no stops, and definitely no Galactic Patrol.”

JACK
(suspicious)
“Sounds shady. What’s in the crates?”

GARTH
“You’re being paid to haul, not ask.”

Jack eyes him warily but doesn’t push. As the last crate is loaded, Jack and Lucy blast off into space.

ACT 2: THE DANGER

EXT. SECTOR 5 – ASTEROID FIELD

Jack’s freighter maneuvers through the treacherous asteroid field. Suddenly, a pirate ship appears on the radar.

LUCY
“Uh, Jack? We’ve got company.”

JACK
“Of course we do. It’s Tuesday.”

The pirate ship hails them. Onscreen appears the leader, CAPTAIN ZORN, a reptilian alien with glowing red eyes.

CAPTAIN ZORN
“Hand over the cargo, Ryder, and we won’t turn your ship into scrap metal.”

JACK
(over intercom)
“Yeah, well, you can kiss my—”

Before he finishes, Zorn’s ship fires. Jack and Lucy engage in a daring chase through the asteroid field, using quick maneuvers and hidden countermeasures to outwit the pirates.

ACT 3: THE TRUTH

INT. JACK’S FREIGHTER – CARGO BAY

After escaping the pirates, Jack opens one of the crates, against Lucy’s warnings. Inside, he finds strange alien technology emitting a low hum.

LUCY
“That… doesn’t look like your usual SolCorp shipment.”

JACK
“Nope. This looks like trouble.”

Suddenly, a distress signal interrupts.

DISTRESS SIGNAL (V.O.)
“Mayday! This is the Kepler Colony. We’re under attack!”

Jack realizes the cargo may be a weapon—and that SolCorp isn’t delivering supplies to the colony, but rather to its attackers.

ACT 4: THE CHOICE

EXT. SPACE – NEARING KEPLER-22B

Jack contacts the colony while debating what to do.

COLONY LEADER (V.O.)
“Please! If you can deliver supplies, we might stand a chance!”

LUCY
“This could cost us everything, Jack. SolCorp doesn’t forgive, and the Galactic Patrol’s already looking for you.”

JACK
“Yeah, well, some things are bigger than credits.”

Jack redirects the freighter to the colony, dodging SolCorp’s drones and Galactic Patrol ships in a high-stakes race against time.

ACT 5: THE HERO

EXT. KEPLER-22B – PLANET’S SURFACE

Jack lands amidst chaos. Alien defenders greet him, skeptical of his intentions, until he opens the crates and reveals the technology inside.

JACK
“Figured you folks could use this more than SolCorp’s goons.”

The technology helps the colony fend off attackers, but Jack’s freighter takes heavy damage during the escape.

FINAL SCENE

INT. JACK’S FREIGHTER – CAB

Jack, bruised and battered, leans back in his chair. The freighter limps through space, sparks flying.

LUCY
“You know SolCorp’s gonna be after us for this, right?”

JACK
(smiling)
“Yeah, but they gotta catch me first.”

The freighter disappears into the stars as a voice crackles over the radio.

RADIO DISPATCHER (V.O.)
“Big Rig Gamma-47, you’re clear for another run. You up for it, Ryder?”

Jack smirks and flips the radio on.

JACK
“Always.”

1gts6ty,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1gts6ty/im_at_a_lost_for_words/,I’m at a lost for words,"So a little context first. One day after our class me (20M) and my classmate (19F) walked and talked to her car. When saying our goodbyes I asked her if she wanted to grab coffee over Fall Break. She agreed and after some planning we met at a local Starbucks. I paid for her, and we sat down and got to know each other for about 3 hours. We both learned a lot about each other in that time. However most importantly we learned that we both share many of the same values and belief since we’re both Christians. Overall it was very nice, and I quite enjoyed it. So, after coffee I asked if she’d like to make our next met a date. She agreed, but warned me that she recently came out of a nasty breakup about a year ago. Which I told her that was fine, and if she was still willing to make it a date. She agreed again and we went our different ways. A week later we went on our first date to a local Pumpkin Patch. The first half was just the generic awkward first date. A lot of small talk and getting to know each other type stuff. Then after we went through the corn maze she asked if we could grab some hot coco. We walked over to the stand, brought some, and then sat down at a nearby table and started talking. I don’t remember how it got to it, but she then wanted to talk about her breakup. It was the only other relationship she was in, and it was with a long time family friend. She also told me she was Sexually Assaulted by said guy. One cold night, she and the guy hoped into his car after a date. Where he locked the doors, jumped on her, and began to touch her inappropriately. She fought him off and begged him to take her home which he did. She then asked if I had any previous relationships which I haven’t besides a fling long ago. We continued to talk, but the things that stood out to me the most was. How she didn’t like clinginess and how she values her own time, she wants to go very slow when it comes to relationships, and how she wants things to be “friendly”. Afterwards we went on the hayride, I asked her if we could hold hands, then we held hands all the way back to the car. About a week later we had our second date planned, we were going out to eat and then head to a Barnes and Noble afterwards. But a day before the date I got this text: “I also wanted to share with you again that building a friendship with you is where my comfort level is at. I really enjoy talking with you, and we have a lot in common.  I hope you are ok with that. It’s so important to me to enjoy that getting to know you aspect without the other stuff first. 🤗 Your hugs are great though ☺️. That also means, you shouldn’t pay for all my stuff, even though that’s very kind. I’ll pay for myself. :)” I was for better or worse, lost for words. I went around asking my friends what the hell just happened and what I should do. The majority of answers I got was friendzoned and that I shouldn’t keep wasting my time with her. We still went on that “date” and we did talk about it. However it was very difficult for me to convey how I felt. I mean I really liked her a lot and now it feels as if I gotta throw away my feelings or bottle them up for another time that I don’t know I’ll get. She was very sweet and supportive about it all which I really appreciated. But I felt like all I could do is agree with what she wanted, which was being friends before anything like romance was introduced. The rest of the afternoon with her was very nice as always. However we haven’t been out together since. Last week her family went on vacation, and this week we could have met but I was too busy with work. I guess what I’m asking on this post is whether I should keep fighting or not? In that text I felt like she made it obvious her feelings could change or perhaps she wasn’t ready yet. A small bit of hope came back last Friday when she asked if we could grab coffee this weekend but like I said I couldn’t. What do y’all think of all of this? Am I just chasing a ghost? I’d appreciate any insight.",1,1731890019.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Instead of letting it fizzle out (like usual with distance matches), he suggested we do a virtual movie date using MovieJar. I was super skeptical at first because virtual dates always seemed kinda weird to me, but honestly? Best first Bumble date I've had.

First off, it was so much more relaxed than regular first dates? No awkward outfit stress, no anxiety about getting to the meeting spot on time, no weird ""who's paying"" moment.

We used the site to pick our movie (it chose ""Palm Springs"" - perfect first date movie btw) and watched over video call. Why it was actually amazing:

* Zero pressure to fill every silence with conversation
* Could actually see his genuine reactions to funny scenes
* Felt 100% safer than meeting a stranger right away
* His bookshelf and movie posters in the background gave me better convo starters than any coffee shop would
* We both got to be comfy at home
* Could actually hear each other (unlike trying to talk in a crowded bar)
* No awkward end-of-date goodbye!

The best part was how natural it felt? Like at one point he got up to make tea and I grabbed some snacks and it wasn't weird at all. We could just be ourselves without that first-date performative stuff. When he got excited about certain scenes I could see him in the little video window and it was actually really cute?

We ended up talking for an hour after the movie about everything from our favorite directors to our worst date stories. Already planned a second movie date for next week, then thinking about meeting halfway for dinner once we're more comfortable with each other.

For anyone who automatically swipes left on distance matches - maybe give virtual dates a shot? It's free (themoviejar.com) and honestly way less stressful than sitting at Starbucks trying to think of things to say while also worrying if you have coffee breath 😅",8,1731889921.0,Bumble,1,0.9,False

I had my phone on the lowest brightness possible and pulled my phone close to my chest to one side, so to limit the amount of light from my phone. I don’t have the best attention span and struggle to pay attention to long movies. With it being over 2 hours long, I checked my phone a couple of times to check the time and some of my messages.

I understand that some people find this annoying and as such I try to be as mindful as possible, however I don’t think the reaction was necessary at all. She could’ve went over to me and asked me, instead of chucking a coffee cup at me.

Nitrogen vacancy nano diamond particles have unique Quantum properties that allows for Quantum communication sensing computing..

They cross bbb and bind to your neurons in different brain regions.

Then they use the other entangled pair of the photon to communicate with the one in your brain. Millions of them. One small cup of coffee can contain 440 million of this particles mixed with coffee. Imagine getting toxed by this stuff for years. 

Paired photons are easy to produce, gold and diamond particles mostly chosen, others could exist. 

Millions of Entangled photons are in your brain and some Sattilite in space or any other medium. They use any type of microwave or Radio to charge or stimulate this nanos. They have on off neutral nature.

I’ve been experiencing a lot of bloating and pain lately again and decided to give coffee enemas another try, however I feel a bit off afterwards, like I’m detoxing too much. I’m also wondering if I have diverticula, or pouches, in my colon as I tend to experience the bloating in the exact same places every time. I did an enema this morning and now I notice I have bloating in the usual spots. If I press on them there’s a lot of bubbling noises. So I’m wondering if it’s possible that the coffee might pool in the diverticula? Could this cause issues? I haven’t been able to find any information on this. I’m guessing for now the best course of action would be abdominal massage to move any liquid that could potentially be stuck. Any other thoughts or info? Is it safe to do coffee enemas with diverticula? TIA!",1,1731889478.0,coffeeenema,0,1.0,False

I don’t know if I can.  

I’m not loved by parents,  
That’s perfectly clear,  
Conditions a plenty,  
Plenty to fear.  

Every step I take,  
Every half resigned breath,  
Every blink of my eyes,  
Every singular beat of my heart,  
Is judged, is ridiculed, is unloved.  

Not my parents, no, someone else?  

Romance, what fun,  
Fun’s the wrong word,  
But I’ll use the word “fun,”  
For this black joke absurd.  

“Find romance later,  
You need it not now,”  
I said to myself,  
The fattest of cows.  

Maybe that bliss,  
That ignorance mine,  
The ingenuous lie,  
To spare me some time.  

What talent?   
What practice?  
A talentless fop,  
Relaying such love,  
I’ll show you,  
Full stop.  

When later did come,  
I did play the whore,  
For little short fun,  
Not bad, slightly sore.  

I don’t like my body,  
I didn’t like theirs,  
They gave some sort of love,  
Might as well share.  

In bed and in cars,  
In alleyways, bars,  
It’s something,  
It’s something,  
Something sub-par.  

Okay, not whoredom,  
Let’s try to find love,  
“Try” the keyword,  
Again, so absurd.  

Yes! No. Yes! No.  
Um. Yes! You’ll do.  
I guess.  

Great a someone,  
Let’s see how it goes!  
We go and get coffee,  
What “fun,” he no shows.  

Maybe a fluke,  
Let’s try again?  
A similar “um,”  
But like the other,  
Okay.  

He actually comes,  
Check one, not bad,  
We then start to talk,  
Then it gets bad.  

Bad, not awful,  
He’s mostly just boring,  
I smile, I reply,  
I am almost snoring.  

He’s fine, he’s fine!  
There’s nothing that’s wrong,  
I am just wrong,  
Simply so wrong,  

We don’t talk again,  
Though he certainly tries,  
You don’t deserve this,  
I’m sorry, guilty lies.  

Rinse and repeat,  
Shame sorrow guilt,  
A sad piece of flesh,  
So poorly built.  

Again I choose whore,  
Rinse lather repeat,  
Not much, but something,  
Good sir, take your seat.  

Parents and pimps  
And all those poor dates,  
No someone, no something,  
Love sorrow hate.  

“What about friends!”  
Fine. Take a seat,  
I do want to punch you,  
Don’t make me repeat.  

Yes there are friends,  
There have always been “friends,”  
Or maybe not, you choose,  
Hear now my new friend.  

Friends and friends,  
I’ve had a few I suppose.:.  

I think I have some,  
We talk and we laugh,  
We do share some secrets,  
But…. 

New lesson, quick math.  

I have now some friends,  
And I’ve lost plenty more,   
I will keep these friends,  
Most important of chores.  

Every second,   
Every day,  
Every shield up,  
Each handshake with gloves,  
Oh fucking shut up!  

But it’s the closest I have,  
The best that I have,  
It’s all that I have,  
I won’t let it go!  

It isn’t so bad,   
My shields slightly lowered,  
It’s better, it’s better,  
I won’t be a doward.  

Imperfect imperfect,  
What you suggest?  
If you say get new friends,  
I will stab your chest.  

If there one single thing,  
A thing worse than this muck,  
It’s nothingness total,

After years of stomach issues (bloating, pain, burning, and constant fullness after eating), I finally got an endoscopy last year that confirmed it. None of the other tests I did over the past 5 years showed anything, so it was a relief to get some answers, but now I’m struggling to figure out how to manage this long-term. I’ve recently cut out coffee and I’ve never been an alcohol drinker. I’m hoping cutting the coffee out helps. I’m also eating a super clean diet based on the book called “the heal your gut cookbook”.

I’ve noticed I go through cycles: months where I feel fine and then, out of nowhere, I’ll have a few months where I feel awful again. On top of the stomach symptoms, I’ve been dealing with neck pain, nerve issues like tingling in my hands and feet, and constant pebble-like stools (with the occasional normal poop).

I’d really appreciate any tips, insights, or experiences on managing this condition. Is there hope to feel consistently better? What’s worked for you or someone you know?  I posted my results along with my question. Thanks in advanced!",4,1731889292.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

The other day, I put my clothes in the washer and headed to the gym. When the cycle finished, someone in the dorm group sent a message saying, “The washing machine is done; please come get your clothes.”

I replied to her privately, letting her know I was on my way home and needed about 10 minutes. But, I was a bit late—more like 13-15 minutes. When I got to the laundry room, I was surprised to see that she had waited there the entire time! I didn’t expect that at all.

As soon as I saw her, I blurted out, “Oh, you waited the whole time here?” She smiled, and we started talking. She’s really pretty, and I could feel myself getting a little nervous but excited at the same time. We chatted briefly about university while I collected my clothes. She wasn’t dry at all—she kept answering, asking questions, and showing interest in the conversation.

Here’s the thing: I already have her number from the dorm group, but I’m not sure how to approach her. Should I text her and invite her for coffee? Or is there a better way to ask her out while keeping things respectful?

P.S. We’re in the same semester but different majors.

My boyfriend had slightly high blood pressure so he bought a home monitor. It's on the cheaper end, but seems relatively accurate for him. He lowered salt and coffee and now his reading is always right around 120/80 at home, the pharmacy, and the doctor. Give or take 5-7 points, which I don't think is too bad.

About a year and a half ago our home monitor ​worked fine for me. My blood pressure was always around 106/66 at all three monitoring places, sometimes higher at the doctor, i guess from nervousness. Then I became anemic and the doctors office said 120/70, the pharmacy said 90/59, and the home monitor said 126/60 (on average). Two weeks ago I had major abdominal surgery, so Im not alarmed by a lower reading, but now the pharmacy machine says 75/54 while the home monitor says 128/59. Havent been to the doctor yet.

Do home monitors have trouble reading low blood pressure in particular? Im not worried about my bp, just how to get accurate readings. Over this past year ive come to believe the pharmacy machines readings most of all. That one also tells my boyfriend his is a little high sometimes.

I'm trying to remember back as to why I decided to choose this username, but I guess it was thought of out of boredom lol... Imagine if this was my real name.  I'm sure would be super annoying to write out on exams over and over and the teachers would have gotten a heart attack. At least people wouldn't butcher it like how they tend to do with my real name. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 28 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life - someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

I love this Persian rug, it’s an heirloom, but it doesn’t quite match my personal interior style. Especially with the chrome mcm chairs, I don’t really feel like it fits my aesthetic. The last two photos fit the style I would like to decorate in. Open to feedback, suggestions, and would love links to recommendations 

Goals: 
- integrate the teal Persian rug with my style
- find a way to have a media console, or a piece of furniture that could act as a bookshelf/storage/tv stand (pls suggest if you are thinking of something specific!). I want to stack the blue and pine stools and move them to make room for a media console. 
- ideally keep both chrome chairs
- The door in the living room is not actually an entrance, so blocking it is fine. Covering it up somehow without the molding being covered would be great
- I’d like to replace the coffee table
- incorporate art

Non- negotiable: 
the couch, the desk and chair location, the piano, the TV

I would really love to get a Japanese paper lamp, some shelving, and to hopefully not make the room look too crowded. Would love some help!! Thanks in advance 😊

I would love to be your friend!","Did it work? I'm sure it worked if you're reading this! So hi, I'm BlueExodia0. I'm trying to remember back as to why I decided to choose this username, but I guess it was thought of out of boredom lol... Imagine if this was my real name.  I'm sure would be super annoying to write out on exams over and over and the teachers would have gotten a heart attack. At least people wouldn't butcher it like how they tend to do with my real name. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 28 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life - someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I’m looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I’m not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I’m very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific “type” of person! I’m looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn’t be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I’m not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn’t?) - I’m definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I’m a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I’m very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you’d be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I’ve mentioned in my post, it’s up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on “hey” or smalltalk responses.

***Tuesday***

Nuncio sat on a wicker single-seat chair on the balcony of Fisk’s Puerto Rico penthouse apartment with his feet crossed at the ankle on the balustrade. The ocean breeze did as little for him as the waves that rolled in from the north to crash against the beach below, but his raised feet were acting as a barrier of sorts.

He could have just as easily sat in the living room to achieve his current objective, and he probably would have had it not been such a visceral reminder that he was not at home where he wanted to be. The fresh air outside was both unwelcome and grounding.  

Ignoring the other environmental cues, he focused on the double screen of his phone, which he had partially resting on his raised thighs, his eyes compounding to see into several systems at once through his vantablack web. He hated being stuck on this stupid island, and he was missing his son like crazy, but right at that moment, all that was pushed aside in favour of this moment.

Tucker’s lawyers had presented the uncontested divorce first thing yesterday morning and had paid extra to have it expedited. By law, he and Helen were no longer married, and their assets were split accordingly.

Now that he didn’t have to watch Helen like a hawk anymore, he could shift gears and search the NYPD databank for the perfect detective to drop the career-altering bombshell on. It had never entered his mind to share his knowledge with Daniel. *Fuck that.* The bastard would be more interested in why he hadn’t bothered to share it before now and chase down that issue rather than going after the bitch they all hated.

As if Nuncio would allow himself to be lectured at by a kid who hadn’t even hit three digits yet. *Pulllllease.*

Besides, Daniel was famous enough. Let someone else who hated the rich getting away with shit steal the limelight.

Peeking through the precinct’s cameras, Nuncio watched his target as the older man, with a prominent bald spot separating his light brown hair, clasped his fists together behind his lower back and arched backwards away from his desk. His expression tightened in a grimace, then softened in relief as he pushed himself away from the glowing screen he’d been typing into.

There was no audio on the feed, but that didn’t stop Nuncio from reading the man’s lips and interpreting his every movement. It all screamed, *‘Oh, thank God!’* as he reached forward and switched the monitor off.  

Nuncio huffed out an annoyed breath. *As if Uncle YHWH had anything to do with that.*

There was nothing special about the detective to look at. He was the epitome of average, from his height and weight to his eye and hair colours to his mid-range physique.

Only one thing stood out about him. The reason why he hadn’t stood up before stretching. With his computer off, he grabbed his jacket off the back of his chair and slid his arms into the sleeves, covering his sidearm and badge on his belt. Then he stood up on his prosthetic left leg, which allowed him to walk (and even run – for a given definition of it) but not easily go from sitting down to standing up.

His desk was the only one with a light still on, refusing to leave until the very last moment. His partner had left at eleven, after Hayden had promised him he’d be right behind him. Of course, he lied, which was why, hours later, Nuncio was still waiting for him to go.

After 3 AM rolled around and he was still on page two of the same warrant request form, fighting a computer he was clearly losing the war with, Nuncio decided to slip into the system and give him a hand from the other side.

Twenty minutes later, the eight-page document was complete, and Detective Hayden Wallace seemed ready to call it a night. He’d been so tired he hadn’t reacted at all to the basic spellcheck that had magically morphed into a fully integrated autocorrect, anticipating his wording so that by the time he looked up to check what he was writing, there was nothing for him to fix – even in context.  

With the paperwork finally submitted, he gave a mighty yawn and headed for the door.

Nuncio pulled back, both from the system and the precinct’s security cameras, and grinned. “Have a pleasant evening, Detective Wallace,” he said to the now absent NYPD officer. His finger hit send on his phone, and he watched with satisfaction as it pinged a dozen times through his vantablack web and the dark web before surfacing within an existing email server that then carried through the internet’s traditional network to land in the Detective’s inbox under the subject line ‘Angela Benson’. “You’re about to become famous.”

\* \* \*

“I can’t get over how lifelike they are,” I said as I exited Boyd’s drying room. “You’d swear they should get off their stands and walk around the room.”

Boyd was grinning at my praise, and it occurred to me that as standoffish as he had been with me, I hadn’t been exactly forthcoming in my praise of him either. We weren’t just on two different wavelengths but two different planets in two different solar systems.

“I think they look good, too,” he agreed, his eyes flicking to the doorway and the carvings inside. “I’m just worried that it’s not only my work. Your dad’s tools are helping me to cheat…”

“Okay, I’m gonna pull you up there. And yes, I can because you’re going to listen to what I have to say. Robbie has Voila. That crazy box keeps everything he makes exactly the way it goes in. It makes his life ridiculously easy when planning every meal because he no longer has to time everything to have it all ready together. Would you agree that helps him save time?”

“But we were eating his food before Voila came onto the scene,” Boyd countered.

My hand immediately pointed down the hallway toward the living apartment next door. “Was that carving of my family on our coffee table done before or after you got your fancy tools?” I countered.

He went to argue. I could see it in his eyes, but he couldn’t refute my words, and he knew it. “So maybe … *just maybe* … the divine carving tools for you are like the divine Voila box is for Robbie. Not in place of it, but a complement to it.”

“I hadn’t really thought about it like that,” Boyd admitted.

“I mean, if you want me to prove they’re only complementary, I can,” I added. When he frowned at me questioningly, I waved his concerns aside. “Easy. Just get me a piece of wood you don’t care about, and I’ll show you what I mean in ten seconds flat.”

I know I piqued his curiosity when he left me and went into the storeroom, returning a few seconds later with a wooden block about eight inches round.

Honestly, if he’d said any of this crap to anyone else, I was amazed no one had thought to do this before now. I’m a degree-wielding oceanic eco-warrior. Yet I took the wood from him and carried it back to the workbench like I meant business…

…and nearly dropped it on my foot when my eyes took in the piece still in the midst of being carved on the spinner.

I hadn’t paid it any attention when I first came in, but now that I was up close, I took in the breathtaking beauty made all the more magnificent by the fact that the bottom half was still a solid square chunk of wood. It was like the man in the evening suit with the toddler in his arms was emerging right out of the block.

Boyd pushed past me and gathered the unfinished carving in his hands, transferring it to his left one only so that his right could dust off the spinner. Which was nice of him, but I doubted it would make a lick of difference to the mess I was about to make.

“One good thing about divine tools,” I said as I placed my block on the empty spinner. “I can’t accidentally break them.”

“I wouldn’t want you to,” Boyd agreed. “But what exactly are you trying to prove?”

*Wow, and you all considered me the obtuse one.*

At least I didn’t say that out loud as I picked up the nearest tool from the leather roll that was still open from where he’d abandoned them to come to dinner. I then spun the block of wood and pressed the blade into its rotating surface the same way I’d seen Boyd do it a million times before.

And oh, shoot! I had to seriously watch what I was doing because I couldn’t feel the contact, and at its spinning speed, I couldn’t make out anything at all! Not until after the cut had been made did something fall away! Whole clumps of wood clattered to the workbench and the floor as my piece got smaller and smaller until Boyd reached over my right shoulder, clamped his massive hand around my wrist, and wrenched me away from my masterpiece.

“Are you doing that on purpose?” he demanded angrily. “Or are you trying to kill yourself?”

Okay, not the reaction I’d been going for here, and I guess it showed on my face, for he immediately loosened his grip, just enough to keep me restrained without hurting me.

Since his other hand was still holding the half-finished carving, he walked his fingers along my arm to my hand and cautiously removed the knife, heaving a deep sigh once he had possession of it. “You seriously had no idea what you were doing?” he asked, squinting at me.

I shrugged and shook my head, knowing my eyes were saucer-wide.

“So, you didn’t see how many times you practically cut off your other fingers or the way that last swipe missed your left wrist by a fuckin' hair?”

That would be a resounding *no,* and I went as far as to check my other hand for all the necessary digits, just to be sure.

In the meantime, he placed that knife back in its fancy pouch, followed by all the others until they were all away, and he rolled the pouch across the table for good measure to hide the dangerous items from my sight. “Okay, clearly I have to be more careful where those things are concerned.”

I looked at my hacked-up lump of wood that was now the size of a badly beaten, flattened, on one side, tennis ball: if you squinted one eye and shut the other. “The tools aren’t doing jack, just like Voila isn’t doing anything for Robbie’s cooking. Having a divinely sharpened knife doesn’t turn its wielder into you, and I just proved that. The skill involved in using them is all you, man, so own it.”

Boyd took another deep breath and let it out slowly. “It’s hard to argue with, after that little show and tell.”

Which had been my entire point.

I'm missing something? ,"I love my husband, he's a great guy, he has many positive attributes, we're great friends, but he's a gross human and I've recently hurt his feelings because I said as much when I snapped because of the following just building up, I've asked over and over to do better, he literally has a tattoo that says ""be better"" and in 5 years nothing has changed. I'm just as much at fault because I clean up after him- it's my space and I have to live in it comfortably too- but idk what to do besides threaten divorce and I don't want to divorce, so I don't want to threaten something I can't follow through on. 

* He doesn't pick up or clean up after himself- yesterday I asked him to pick up all his clothes so I could run the roomba and start laundry, he did, but 24 hours later there's clothes scattered on the coffee table, end table, kitchen table, floor, etc. we have 3 hampers, he doesn't use a single one. 
* His desk has dirty dishes on it and trash from take out, could be there for days- yes we have fruit flies and he doesn't care. His desk (and mine because he uses mine occasionally) has sticky spots from food
* One of our senior dogs had an accident while he was standing in the next room, supposedly didn't hear it and let the other dogs run through it, but had to jet off to work so I'm stuck mopping the whole house now
* When he DOES do the dishes, which could be days of dirty food-crusted piled up dishes in the sink, he doesn't clean out the sink of all the food. When he DOES cook or make food, he leaves crumbs and spills on the counters
* Doesn't clean up after he shaves, frequently find beard clippings on the sink
* ""forgets"" to flush the toilet and I sit down to pee only to find pee and sometimes poop in the toilet
* Licks his plates clean, literally, and when I looked at him disgusted he took offense but started wiping the plates clean with his fingers and sucking his fingers (am I crazy for this one? He's super offended that I hate this)
* I get home from work and he will literally have food dried in his beard, one his face, and sometimes even on his chest- he doesn't wear clothes around the house on his days off. Why is there crusted pizza sauce in your chest hair???
* All his clothes have stains, he doesn't use stain remover, and instead just wears them with stains or buys new ones
* His car is a trash can, but gets offended when I don't let him drive ""mine"" even though we don't have designated cars, sorry I don't want your greasy fingerprints on my steering wheel or sticky cupholders??
* where he brushes his teeth has toothpaste splatter on the sink, faucet, handles, and mirror
* Was off for 2 days while I worked 12 hours shifts and did literally nothing, I asked him at the very least to sweep and run the roomba because we have dogs and it's something I do every day when I'm off, something he should be doing on the days he's home and I'm not, but he didn't, I literally melted down getting ready for work the second day because I stepped on so much dirt and hair and crap trying to get dressed. I came home the second morning to him STARTING to sweep. Nothing else got done, no dishes or laundry. One time I picked up an extra shift the next day and asked him to wash my clothes for me while he was off that day, he didn't and I had to do it when I got home
* Lets his acne bleed when we go to sleep so all our pillows and sheets have blood stains
* Throws wet towels into the laundry bin and then piles clothes on top, so all our clothes and towels end up smelling like mildew

Some of this stuff is probably things I could look over or ignore but they just pile up and I have so much resentment and frustration, it clouds our quality time now for me. I've told him he acts like a child, and I hate being his mother asking him daily multiple times to clean up, he told me he hates that I treat him like a kid by constantly nagging him but what else can I do? How are you supposed to know your spouse will be like this when you don't live together for more than a couple months before marriage? Is this divorce worthy when he's a really good guy and otherwise mostly a great husband? When I bring up these things he says he'll do better but there's no consequences, there's no incentive for him to do better... I feel like if he cared about me he'd do better but idk if that's fair, he does care and he shows it in a lot of other ways. He does have ADHD but he is medicated, although he constantly has his phone in his face no matter what he's doing so he's not paying attention to anything outside of whatever is on youtube.

1gtrm38,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1gtrm38/my_little_ibs_rant/,My little IBS rant,"

I've been dealing with mysterious abdominal pain for quite some time—about six years now. It started off as a mild issue but became significantly worse about four years ago. Since then, I've tried numerous treatments, including some unscientific ones, like coffee enemas. If you've spent enough time in health groups on Facebook, you've likely come across someone recommending it. I wish I had known better because it only made things worse.

The pain is primarily on the right side of my abdomen, just under the ribcage. It feels like someone is pressing and twisting my insides, and during a flare-up, it becomes so intense that I struggle to breathe properly.

Over the years, I've seen countless doctors and tried various treatments, but nothing has brought lasting relief. My digestion has been severely impacted—I can barely tolerate food, and I have numerous intolerances that trigger different symptoms.

It’s incredibly disheartening to endure this level of pain for so long without finding effective help. I've undergone many tests, yet my condition seems to worsen over time. I often blame myself, both for how it started and for the decisions I made along the way.

It’s been years since I’ve been able to eat a meal without worrying about how it will affect me.

The only problem is that I'm not sure where to start when it comes to interior design... so any suggestions are appreciated!

Seeing how lengthy the room is, I decided that it might be best to have different ""zones"" to separate the living room and entry area (which I think is supposed to be a dining area? Not sure). The living room area is about 11x13, but let's say 11x12 to be safe. I also included a picture of a wall heater that takes up 62 inches of the space.

Just know that some of the furniture I have in the pictures aren't permanent; I plan to switch out the dresser for an actual media console/credenza, get a rug (any colors or suggestions on size would be awesome), and possibly a coffee table as well!

Thanks for the help!

I had a girlfriend and a friend group… and everything flipped during Covid era.. there was allot of behavior I didn’t align with and I walked away from it all… even though it was my choice it was a trauma… I started to focus on self help… any minor spiritual beliefs I had I focused on more.. I found tantra.. and micro dosing magic mushrooms for depression at this time… and it triggered kundalini activation the Mix of extreme events, tantra, and micro dosing… after that I went from a reductionist mind 3d mind set… to a full on spiritual deep dive… 360 personality change over the passed couple of years.. kundalini has triggered many continual paranormal phenomena to happen around me… and the biggest as of this year is seeing orbs of light every night in the sky… along with spontaneous remote viewing. Psychic downloads. Seeing aura… hearing ghost… intense stuff… I also organically went sober out the blue… no use for substances.. I feel I do better sober… weed is nice… just not for me anymore… I never was into drinking… 
But my question is…. I guess at times I feel like dating again… it just seems there isn’t much local places to find energy aligned with me… or maybe that’s a self imposed mental block… I probably have plenty of options… but I seem to want to hold out till I find someone on a spiritual path… that’s also drug free… or if I do find someone attractive it’s not like they walk around holding a sign saying spiritual drug free kundalini activated individual…. I guess I’m wondering how do I navigate this new life of mine… I’m so invested in my spirituality… I just picture being on a date talking about metaphysical phenomena and the whole time someone not believing me… I rarely watch tv or pop culture… the most normal things I do are make art and do martial arts… but besides that it’s all spiritual practice… 
What are y’all’s opinions on navigating the dating world when this is what your experiencing? Or is it even important to align with all these things when you ask a girl out for a coffee??? 
I guess the coffee date is where I’d test the waters to even see if she’s receptive to all this stuff? ",5,1731888257.0,starseeds,6,0.86,False

1gtre25,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1gtre25/carrot_cake_problem/,Carrot Cake Problem ,"Im addicted to carrot cake. It’s just soooooo good. It all started because a friend had a party where everyone bought a homemade cake to swap. (I’d just had my daughter and breastfeeding hunger is crazy.) Before I knew it I’d polished off eight slices of the carrot cake try bake with cream cheese icing her mum had made. It was so good! 
Things progressed the next day when I decided to take the pram for a spin to my local supermarket in an attempt to get my four month old to nap. I was in the reduced section looking at the battered cans when I spotted a ‘taste the difference’ carrot cake. Now prior to this I was a coffee and walnut girl and would have left it alone, but i remembered how good the cake was from the day before and couldn’t leave it be. 
Since then things have gotten a little out of hand and I’m pretty sure the check out staff are now recognising me as the crazy carrot cake lady. I started begging my husband to go instead, but after he realised I was on more then five days of carrot cake in a row he told me he was taking a break from cake delivery duties for my own good. 
A slight set back but luckily for me, when you have a baby lots of people want to come and visit and almost all of those people will text me first asking if we need anything. I’m sure you can all guess where this is headed. My husband is quite amused that I found an alternative delivery option so I could hide my new found addiction from the nice check out ladies but there we go. My slightly secret confession of addiction. Hopefully it wares off before diabetes sets in. 

Sorry for any spelling mistakes but I’ve had no sleep thanks to my lovely little one and likely have a sugar rush from all that Icing. 

Ps if anyone has any good carrot cake recipes please share them. Or better yet dust them off and have a go at making some yourself. ",1,1731887732.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,0.67,False

I am just utterly confused, no bewildered is a better word.

After high school, I was put on medications that helped me stabilize my mental health enough to work on myself and my relationship with food a lot. I have been relatively better, until this year. I went from >!170-180 lbs!< to what I am now. 

This is also where the confusions start for me because I have also been having some medical issues having to do with my heart and possible PCOS. Something my doctors have been telling me is that my gain may be due to an underlying medical issue. But I feel like I have been >!binging!< I mean to the point where my friend (also a coworker) has noticed it and has brought it up to me. I just feel confused. I mean I hope there is some magical painfully obvious solution to make this all go back to normal but I know deep down there isn't.

I'm trying to remember back as to why I decided to choose this username, but I guess it was thought of out of boredom lol... Imagine if this was my real name.  I'm sure would be super annoying to write out on exams over and over and the teachers would have gotten a heart attack. At least people wouldn't butcher it like how they tend to do with my real name. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 28 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life - someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

1. Put all the ingredients in a shaker and dry shake around 30 seconds (you can skip the dry skating step if you want I just find it helps me achieve a better foam because I can shake it longer without my hands hurting from the cold)

Six miles into the hike and she was still bounding with energy while I neared the brink of collapse.



\*bang bang bang bang\*



Taking no notice of the pounding that had just drifted through the trees, she paused to allow me to catch up with her, and teased me for becoming an old man. Our tenth time making the trek—an annual tradition to return to the place where I’d proposed—and she looked as beautiful as she had on the first.



\*Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang\*



It was louder now—enveloping us. Desperately I tried to ignore it too—fighting to stay in the moment—fighting to stay with her. I knew what was waiting if I gave in…



\*BANG BANG BANG\*



“Fuck…”



I opened my eyes, and she was gone.



And I was back… \*there…\*



Light bringing no warmth streamed in through the window, and I shivered, uselessly pulling the meager, moth-bitten sheets tighter to my body.



A full month’s worth of frigid mornings had taught me to expect the chill air forcing its way through the cracks in the crumbling, plaster walls, which brought with it the scent of fresh snow.



“And so continues the endless winter in Hell…” I grumbled, half-awake, as I reached blindly towards the bedside table and wrapped my hand around the glass that I knew would be waiting there—full to the brim with poisonous medicine.



Swallowing its entire contents in two large gulps, I gagged on the flavor of tepid, watered-down, cheap whiskey—potent enough to keep the shakes at bay, yet not quite so strong as to bring any measure of real peace. At least its pain-numbing qualities exceeded those of the booze in the outside world—allowing me to choke back the tears brought on by my shattered back.



\*BANG BANG BANG BANG\*



The cacophony that had woken me continued down on the first floor.



From the sound of it, our fresh arrival was still violently trying to come to terms with his new living arrangements—angrily shouting, pounding on the walls, and, based on the scraping and then the loud crashes that followed, attempting to hurl the dining room chairs through the windows.



“Henri will be furious about having to rebuild those again…” I murmured.



I took another swig from the glass that, by then, had refilled itself, and listened more closely to the man’s words. With only two semesters of college Spanish under my belt, it was some time before I recognized anything that he was screaming.



“¡¿Dónde está la puerta?!” was the only thing I picked out that I fully understood.



‘It will return soon enough.’ I thought to myself, polishing off my second helping of swill, and setting the glass back on the table—feeling the weight of those words more heavily given the events of the last couple days.



‘Best not focus on that part, though.’ I shuddered, propping my back up against the metal bars of the headboard and reaching once again for my only comfort in \*there\*—topped off, as it was, for a third time.



Confined to my bed for the foreseeable future, I heard Henri’s door open and his footsteps thump passed mine as I knew, for the third day in a row, he was going to attempt and calm the fresh tenant.



And, watching the haggard, dirty, broken man in the mirror that faced the bed raise the glass once again to his lips, I reflected back on my first day in The Winter House.

Two years.



It was two years to the day that I lost Sherry.



It had all happened so quickly.



We were on our anniversary hike when, for the first time in our relationship, she fell behind me; then, without warning, collapsed in the middle of the trail.



Hospital visits, tests, diagnosis, treatment, fighting, losing, withering.



Dead.



Six months—that’s all it took. Thirty-seven years of healthy existence, ten years of happy marriage—so much life still left in front of her.



Dead.



Every time I closed my eyes, I could still hear the high-pitched squeal of the machine announcing to me that her heart had stopped when I felt the last of her strength evaporate from the hands I was holding.



For the next two years, I tried to carry on without her—did everything I knew to pull myself out of the swirling pit of despair I’d dropped into the moment she stopped breathing. Friends, family, hiking, lifting, church—I even debated going to therapy, but my father had always told me that that was only for weak men.



Every day, I fell deeper into the hole, and every day, the bottle loomed nearer.



You see, Sherry and I had met in Alcoholics Anonymous. She was already three months sober at the time, and comforted me on my very first day—helped see me through the worst of my detox, kept me going back to meetings, became my biggest advocate.



We were two broken souls that had enough pieces left to hold each other together, and once she was gone, mine was shattered once more.



But she had made me promise that I would keep my sobriety in her absence—made me swear it on the ring she’d worn on her hand every day of our marriage, and that I then wore around my neck every day after her passing.



Yet, one night, I found myself in a bar.



A bar I’d been to many, many times in my pre-Sherry life. A bar so familiar that, though I hung my head in shame, the feet I was watching carried me to a stool that, even after years of my neglect, still felt like home when I sat in it. And, without me uttering a single word, a drink appeared in front of me.



Double-whiskey, on the rocks—the bartender winked and asked where I’d been before shuffling off to take another patron’s order. Staring at the ice cubes suspended in the amber pour of my failure, I apologized to Sherry before downing it in one practiced motion.



Five more helpings of the same tonic at the bar, and a stop at the liquor store on the way home, and I was feeling the best that I had in a long while. In fact, it was the only time in the last two years that I hadn’t felt the crushing weight of Sherry’s death bearing down on my chest, and I was experienced enough to know that the minute I sobered up again, the pain of her loss would return even more intensely than before.



So, I decided that night, on the walk between the liquor store and my house, that I was never going to be sober again. My plan was to continue drinking in every waking minute of every hour of every day of the remainder of my life, until my liver finally would give out on me.



And, in that instant, I felt an incredible sense of relief.



Everything seemed so simple then—I was a locksmith who worked for himself, so I didn’t need to worry about being fired for intoxication. All I needed to do from then on would be to make enough money to afford my rent, utilities, food, and booze while I waited for death to take me.



What I did not know, at the time, was that I’d just made myself a target.

\&#x200B;



When I arrived home that evening, I immediately stumbled my way into the kitchen and grabbed a plastic cup from the cabinet. Given I was already nearly toppling over with each step, I was certain I’d shatter anything glass if I tried to use it, and therefore was more than happy to fill my NASCAR chalice with a heavy dose of whiskey and ice.



The next hour or so, I melted into the couch watching trash TV—working myself halfway through the fifth I’d purchased. It wasn’t long before I passed out—empty vessel in hand—dreamlessly fading into nothing.



I awoke with a headache around three in the morning needing to pee fiercely and, stupidly, I tried to sprint to the restroom—kicking the coffee table on the way there. Blind pain seared through what I imagined was likely a broken pinkie toe on my right foot, necessitating that I limp the rest of my way to the toilet in our master bathroom.



After I’d finished my business, I debated brushing my teeth and laying down in bed for the rest of the night, but with the way my head was feeling, I knew that if I didn’t get some more alcohol into my system before I fell asleep again, the morning would horrendous. And walking back out into our bedroom, I caught sight of something I hadn’t noticed when I’d crossed through the space with my eyes bleary from the tears of my shattered toe.



There was a glass on my bedside table.



Brimming with a brown liquid and ice effortlessly floating through it—tinkling softly as the cubes moved up and down—it appeared as if someone had just placed it there a moment ago.



I blinked repeatedly to make sure it didn’t disappear, but after closing my eyes and opening them for the fourth time, I resigned myself to its reality and focused then on how it could have gotten there.



As I mentioned, I was only planning to drink out of my plastic cup for the evening. Moreover, as far as I was aware, I’d been knocked out on the couch until about five minutes prior. ‘Had it been there when I came into the room initially?’ I pondered. ‘It must have been unless there was someone else in the house with me…’



My heartrate increased considering the possibility that someone had invaded my home, and I stood stock-still for a minute, listening intently for the sound of any other movement in the house. But all that met my ears was the gentle clink of the ice, which I felt should have settled by that time. Yet, when I looked back at the table, it was impossibly still stirring—as if disturbed by an unseen hand.



Grabbing a baseball bat from the closet, I planned then to search the house and started first by checking that I had, in my drunken stupor, remembered to lock the front door. Sherry and I had had a break-in a couple years before she passed and I had personally installed a special deadbolt that used keys which I’d made myself. Of those keys there were only two in existence, and of those two I retained sole possession. So, when I reached the door and found that I had indeed thrown the bolt behind me when I’d returned home earlier, I relaxed slightly.



Confident that no one could have picked the lock and entered through the main entrance, I conducted a thorough search of the remainder of the modest domicile. In doing so, I established that all other doors and all of the windows were locked, sealed, and undamaged, and I detected no trace of anyone besides myself within the walls.



I was alone.



So, I returned to my bedroom, praying as I crossed the threshold that the beverage would simply have vanished, and I could chalk the whole thing up to a hallucination.



But I was sorely disappointed.



There it still stood, solid as the moment I first laid eyes on it—ice continuing to bob up and down. The only explanation that I had for its presence, then, was that I had woken up (or maybe even sleep-walked) sometime before I had arisen to pee, made myself the drink, placed it down next to my bed, and wandered back to the couch.



‘But why in the fuck would I do that?’ I confusedly considered.



If that had been what happened, I would have had to have done it very recently as the ice looked un-melted. And it seemed so odd that I wouldn’t have drank any of it before heading back to the living room. However, as it was the only explanation I could come up with that made any sense to me, and given I had been on my way to the kitchen to fix another drink before I spotted the one already waiting for me, I begrudgingly accepted that it must be the truth—brushing off the concerns that kept popping up in my head.



With that, I approached the table and saw that as I did, my footsteps shook the contents—answering for me how it had appeared to be in a constant state of disturbance. I had been stomping around the house and creating the vibrations that were making it look alive.



So easily, I ignored all of my worries. So easily, I lifted the glass from the table.



So easily, I took a sip…



And…



It was euphoria.



The most delicious drink that had ever passed my lips. In fact, the most delicious thing I’d ever consumed in my life. Far beyond the quality of the piss I knew to be sitting in the plastic bottle in the kitchen that it should have tasted like.



But I didn’t care.



I could not stop myself.



Down, down, down; I gulped its entirety down in a wild frenzy. Unable to move from the spot, unable to care for anything else—I ate the ice—I licked the inner walls of the glass clean—I was about to bite down on the glass itself when I snapped out of it.



For a moment, I felt nothing. But then, as I lowered the empty container from my face, I was struck with an intense surge of pleasure. Every nerve ending surged with warmth—every pain I’d ever known drifted away—Sherry’s hollow, sickened face dissolved from my memories and was replaced with the smile that greeted my mornings for so many years.



I needed more.



Then, as if a bartender had heard my thoughts, I looked down to see the glass was full again.



Madly, I snatched it up—draining the elixir even faster than the first helping. And I was rewarded. I began tingling with the sensations of every joyous minute I’d ever experienced—the best days of my life all flashed before my eyes—the smell of Sherry’s perfume crept into my nostrils.



At that moment, I was positive that I was happiest being on the planet.



While I basked in bliss, a voice rose from the back of my mind, carrying with it only one word.



“MORE!” It demanded.



The glass was full again.



And the third dose barely lasted a second.



I felt Sherry’s arms around my waist—wrapping me in a hug from behind. The weight of her head pressed down on my shoulder and she pulled me gently down onto the bed. Lovingly, she ran her fingers through my hair, and whispered tenderly in my ear.



“Don’t worry—I’ve got you now.”



It was so sweet to hear her voice again, so sweet to feel her warmth beside me.



“I’ve got you now.” She repeated, yet this time, the tenderness was gone.



This time, a darkness filled each syllable.



Panic replaced ecstasy, but I was helpless to do anything about it. Overwhelming exhaustion overcame me, and I was forced, powerlessly, into a heavy and dreamless slumber.



\&#x200B;



\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*



\&#x200B;



Sunlight shone on the inside of my eyelids, and I cracked them open to find it was morning. Nothing about my bedroom appeared different than any other time I’d woken up there, besides that it was absolutely freezing for the middle of summer. Yanking the covers closer to me, I cocooned myself to attempt and warm my bones, but it was to little avail.



A pounding headache prevented the events of the previous evening from returning immediately, but when I rotated my head to look at the clock on the bedside table, there was an empty space on it that I knew, for some reason, should have been occupied.



The glass was gone.



It all came back to me and I, with a start, sat up in bed—quickly to be greeted with an incredible bout of nausea.



Frantically, I ran for the restroom and began to vomit so furiously, I worried that I might not just expel what was inside my stomach, but actually launch my stomach itself into the toilet. It was the most miserable I had ever felt—a hangover so severe that I legitimately considered calling for an ambulance. You would have thought that in that instant, I’d be swearing off alcohol forever. Yet in reality, once I felt assured that I had nothing left inside my body to chuck up, the first thing I did was crawl, like a baby, to the kitchen to find my leftover whiskey from the night before.



Any alcoholic can tell you that the fastest way to cure alcohol withdrawal is to consume more alcohol.



So, with trembling hands, I snatched the half-empty bottle down from the counter and, forgoing any imitations of sophistication, took two large pulls directly from it. I gagged and my stomach churned—it took every ounce of my fortitude to keep it down, but I was able to hold it. Sitting on the floor, I leaned against a cabinet and continued to take small sips every few minutes while I waited for it to take effect. And gradually, I began to feel the hangover symptoms subsiding.



Once I was able to focus on anything other than feeling horribly ill, I thought again about the night before—about the mysterious glass. About how… perfect… it had made me feel. With its conspicuous absence that morning, I wondered if it had all been a very lucid dream—maybe it really had been a hallucination brought on by the binge I’d gone on after such a long period of sobriety.



Whatever the case, as the whiskey displaced more and more of the healthy ingredients of my blood, I focused less on the, likely, imagined events of the night before, and more on my growing hunger. With that sensation returning, I knew that I would be feeling well enough to stand and hauled myself to my feet.



Swaying a bit more than I expected, I continued to take intermittent gulps of drink as I managed to fumble my way through a shower, teeth brushing, and getting dressed, so that I could at least head out to get a greasy fast-food breakfast and another bottle for the afternoon.



Feeling at least presentable enough for the liquor store, I stepped out through the front door, closed it behind me, and turned my key in the deadbolt to lock it. But when I spun it back to the center position to remove the key from the door, it got stuck.



Yanking on it as hard as I could, it refused to pull free from the lock. I tried jiggling it a bit, but couldn’t shake it loose. Then, I tried twisting it back to the locked position, but it wouldn’t budge that direction either.



Annoyed, I was about to head to my truck to grab some of my smithing tools to force it to come out, when something… happened…



The key rotated on its own to unlock the door.



I stared at it in disbelief for a moment—there was no way that should have been possible. Even if someone was standing on the other side of the door and had spun the deadbolt handle, it wouldn’t have moved the key externally.



Confused, but significantly inebriated such that I was more frustrated than scared at the time, I tried to turn it back to lock the door again, but found it was now frozen in the unlocked position.



Unsure of what to make of the situation, I decided to open the door to begin investigating the entire mechanism when I was met with a sight that I’ll never forget.



My living room was gone.



Instead, the door had opened to reveal the dingiest interior I’d ever seen. From what I could make out under a thick coating of dirt, there were wood floors where there should have been carpet—a dining room with a sloping table and three crippled chairs took the place of my kitchen—and a sitting room with one tattered sofa occupied the space where my recliner and TV should have been.



Every surface was topped with such a thick layer of dust that the only distinguishable color was gray. And the most confusing part was that directly in front of me, straight-away from the front door itself, was a flight of stairs leading up to a second floor.



But I lived in a one-story home.



I moved backwards one step and surveyed the exterior of the house just to make absolutely sure that I hadn’t somehow blacked out and found my way to the wrong abode, but there were the numbers of my address on the letterbox right next to the door.



As I had the night before, I blinked again and again in the hopes that my living room would return, but the decrepit image beyond the entry remained unchanged—there were the stairs leading up to the floor that could not exist.



Fear began to eat its way through my liquid courage, and I reflected back on the glass from the night before. Maybe it hadn’t been a dream…maybe I’d been drugged…maybe it was part of a government experiment of some kind with LSD. There needed to be a sane explanation for what I was seeing as it was impossible that my door had randomly decided to open itself into another home.



I went to take another step back, as my instinct then was to take off running, but before I could, a hand shot out from behind the door.



A hand the size of my chest.



A hand with haphazard, jagged spines jutting from the back of it.



Pointed fingers as long as my forearms wrapped themselves around my wrist, and I was pulled inside the dismal foyer before being violently thrown to the ground near the foot of the steps.



I felt my elbow shatter as it slammed into the floor and I heard the door crash shut behind me. Screaming in pain and terror, I turned now to face what had just ripped me into a nightmare only to find my concept of a nightmare had been childishly underestimated.



A naked, pale creature towered over me.



Moving on all fours, it circled me like a predator considering its next meal. And, given the daggerlike, carnivorous teeth it displayed in a mouth that opened wide enough to consume my whole head in one bite, I believed it would not be too long before I discovered what it felt like to be prey.



Its face was rounded—containing slits for nostrils and sunken, black holes where there should have been eyes, but even lacking those, I knew it could see me—it met my gaze no matter what angle I watched it from. If not for the shape of the head and the humanoid hands, it would have appeared much like a twelve foot long, hairless dog but for one additional feature.



The spines.



I’d seen them on the back of the hand that grabbed me, but now that my eyes were adjusting to the light, and I’d blinked away many of the tears that had formed from the pain in my arm—I could see clearly that there were four-to-five-inch spikes sticking out from its flesh on nearly every part of its body sans its face, palms, and soles.



Hundreds of them.



There was no pattern or organization, and when they caught the light from the sun streaming through a window, I took them to be made of bone. On top of the talonlike fingers and the razor teeth, I then pondered that the spines on this thing might be venomous, and I started to cry once more thinking through the horrible, painful ways in which I was about to die.



It moved closer to me, and I braced myself for the inevitable, but then, it simply stepped over my body, and climbed the stairs behind me. I heard it make the hallway above, its steps receding further and further into the house, and then a door slam.



And I was alone again.



Gingerly, I got up from the floor, and backed myself towards the entrance, never taking my eyes off the stairs in case that thing came charging back down them. I felt behind me for the wall, and eventually made contact with it—blindly running my hands along its surface, I searched for the handle, but continued to feel nothing but smooth wood.



Getting nowhere, I risked a look behind me to find the door, but was met with yet another shock.



It had vanished.



\&#x200B;



\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*



\&#x200B;



Staring at a bare wall between two windows, my brain broke momentarily and I began laughing. Laughing hysterically at what, I wasn’t sure, but I knew one thing.



It wasn’t real.



It couldn’t be real.



It was a joke of some kind—it had to be. I turned around expecting people to pop out from behind the moldy sofa, but no one came. I pulled my cellphone from my pocket to see if I had any messages from friends saying they, “got me” to find that it wouldn’t turn on, though it’d had a full charge when I’d walked out of my house just minutes earlier.



Surveying the room around me further, I saw only candles and oil lamps for lighting—no outlets or appliances.



I wondered if I’d somehow stepped outside of time.



With the dire nature of my situation setting in more and more by the minute, I again felt panic building in my chest. Sprinting to one of the windows that flanked where the door should have been, I peered outside to see if I could flag down someone from the street to help me, but my street was not outside those windows.



I don’t know what I’d expected—I’d been pulled into a home not my own, and could then see that the world outside was not the one I’d left behind either. The world outside didn’t even appear to be in the same season as the one I’d come from.



Thick snow blanketed the ground in a sea of trees that stretched further than my eye could discern. Somehow, I’d traveled from summertime in suburbia to a winter forest in an instant. What little buzz I’d had going before leaving my house that morning was fading rapidly and I was not going to be able to contain my terror much longer.



Feeling that fleeing on foot through the woods would be better than exploring any deeper into the house and possibly running into even more terrible creatures, I tried to pry open the window I was looking out of, but it wouldn’t move. I searched for a lock that might be holding it shut, or nails, or screws, anything that would prevent it from letting me out, but there was nothing that I could locate.



Throwing all caution away, I started to punch and kick the window following my body’s instinctual desire to run, but it seemed nothing I did could crack the glass. Overtaken by dread, I forgot even the fear that the monster I’d already met would come soon to devour me and yelled for someone, anyone to help me while I smashed my body into the panes. Eventually, I even tried to throw a chair though it, and it did nothing more than break the chair into pieces.



And it was when I did this that I heard a voice behind me curse in a thick, French accent.



“Motherfucker, it took me weeks to mend that last time!” It snapped.



I shouted and jumped back against the wall after finding a waif of a man behind me. Dressed in the remains of what had possibly been business attire at one time, he’d previously had a mustache, but now above his lip were a few tufts of unkempt mange. And much of the gray, matted hair on his head looked to have been yanked out. His teeth were rotting and his skin browed with dirt, but not enough to cover the needle marks in both of his arms.



A junkie.



“Where am I?! What do you want??” I blurted at the man, who threw a finger in front of his mouth and shushed me threateningly.



“I want you to shut the fuck up and quit breaking shit…



“It doesn’t like it when we fight.” He whispered, ominously—eyes darting to the second floor.



I dropped my voice lower.



“Who are you? What is it? What is this place?” I asked.



“I,” he indicated himself, “am Henri Laurent.



“This,” he gestured to the room around him, “is The Winter House.



“And it…” he pointed up the stairs where the creature had disappeared, “…is The House. And The House is it.”



He was speaking nonsense—clearly high on whatever he’d shot into his veins. My face must have shown my distaste for his bullshit when I was clearly in distress, as he smiled and continued.



“You think I’m fucked up and spouting gibberish at you, no?” He gave a quiet chuckle, “I thought the same thing when Bo explained it to me, but he tried to… gently… deliver the news. I feel it’s easiest for you to hear the blunt truth. You’ll come to accept it more quickly that way.”



“Accept what?” I inquired.



“That you are dead.” He said, nonchalantly.



“I’m dead?!” I snapped, involuntarily.



“Not quite yet, exactly. But you will never leave here alive. Think of this place as a sort of… purgatory… A miserable purgatory…” He trailed off.



“Please,” I pleaded with him. “I just want to go home—can you help me get out of here?”



“Were you not listening?” He quipped. “You cannot leave! No one leaves The House once it has them! It brought you here to feed on you—and there it will never let you go.”



“Stop…” I begged him. It was too much—my whole body was shaking, and I was struggling to breathe. “Please, I don’t want to hear anymore. I just want to go home.” I sniffled with tears returning to my eyes.



“Oh, but you are home.” He said, unsympathetically. “There’s already a room prepared for you upstairs.”



“This isn’t my home!” I shouted.



“Of course it is—you accepted the invitation.” He gave a yellow-toothed smile.



“Invitation?” I racked my brain for a memory of accepting an invite to live with a monster and a junkie Frenchman when it hit me.



The glass.



The drink…



“You remember now, no?” He pestered. “What was it? Pills? Cocaine?”



“A whiskey…” I stammered.



“Ah, yes—alcoholic then. Mine was heroin—the best I’d ever had—three needles full. The shit here is terrible, but it’s all there is…” His expression dropped to one of deepest longing.



“There’s heroin here?” I was astonished.



“Heroin, alcohol, pills, meth, cocaine—whatever brought you here will be here for you, always.” He paused momentarily.



“The House provides.” He finished, then walked towards the shattered chair and picked up some of the pieces. There was a pile in the corner of the room with the remains of several other pieces of furniture, and it appeared he was going to try and mend the chair using pieces of different chairs and still more pieces of chairs as tools.



“You’ll see.” He started up again. “Go check your room—up the stairs and first door on the right—there will be something waiting for you in there that I’m sure you’re beginning to get desperate for.”



“Upstairs? Are you crazy? That thing is upstairs!” I had every intention of keeping as much space between me and the monster until I could figure out what was going on.



“Oh, it won’t bother you now.” He said, “It was only down here to let you in—it’ll stay in its room until it’s time to feed again or unless we try to kill each other.”



He could see that I did not trust him at his word.



“Fine,” he sighed, “would you like me to show you to your room?”



I did not want Henri to show me anywhere—I wanted to wake up. I tried to slap myself several times, but only found Henri’s laughing face staring back at me each time that I did.



“Follow me.” He made a motion behind him and walked towards the stairs. “Come—there is something in your room that will make this easier.”



I saw no reasonable alternatives. I could continue to try and smash unbreakable windows and find an invisible door, or I could follow Henri to “my” room (being I was unwilling to explore any of the rest of The House alone). So, trepidatiously, I accompanied him.



Henri showed me up to the second floor, which comprised a single hallway that led straight back to a door at the end with three others branching off on the sides.



“The Warden lives down there.” He pointed to the door at the end of the hall, “I’m in here,” he threw a thumb towards the first door on the left, “Bo’s in there,” he jabbed a finger to the second door on the left, “and that leaves you in here.”



We stopped in front of the only door on the righthand side of the hall.



I opened my mouth to ask him more questions, including why he’d referred to the creature as “The Warden,” but he shushed me for a second time.



“Just go in and get your head right—I’ll explain how it all works, well at least what’s been passed to me and the little I understand of it, once you’ve taken the edge off a bit.” He gave an encouraging nod towards the door, and I opened it to see a small, and rather shabby room.



My initial reaction was that it had no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and I was unsure what Henri was referring to as something that would help inside. A small cot one might generously call a bed sat under a window on the righthand side with a mirror facing it from the opposite wall. On the left, there was a putrid looking toilet, and the only other furniture was a small nightstand which was barren except for…



A glass of whiskey.



The adrenaline had been masking it, but now that my body no longer felt it was in imminent threat of death, the withdrawal symptoms were encroaching and the pain in my elbow was peaking. I don’t recall entering the room or walking to the edge of the bed—all I know is one second I was at the entry with Henri, and the next I was holding the glass in my hand.



Hesitating, and remembering the many warnings I’d been given during my life to not accept strange food or drinks, I turned back towards the door expecting Henri to be there providing affirmation that it was okay to take a sip, but he’d gone. Instead, I was startled by the touch of another hand on the one that was holding the drink.



A gentle hand.



Sherry’s hand.



My body was frozen by its presence other than the arm she was guiding—she pushed the glass towards my mouth and from behind me, she cooed when it reached my lips, “It’s okay baby—you need this.”



So, I drank.



It was a pale imitation of the quality of ‘The Invitation’—warm and with a flavor more reminiscent of top shelf booze than the transcendent experience I’d had the previous night. However, in that moment, it was everything that I craved. My body relaxed the instant the liquid touched my tongue, and while the powerful ecstasy did not return either, the calming effect was exquisite—even the pain in my elbow receded. Though the high was muted from what I knew was possible, it was still enough for me to beg for more.



And my wish was granted.



I stood, rooted in place, while Sherry’s hands nudged me through two more helpings. And, while I considered that it could have just been due to my intoxication level increasing, I couldn’t help but notice each glassful tasted less potent. 



When I set the glass down the third time, Sherry left me.



“No… No, no—come back!” I yelled.



But she did not return.



Alone once more, and with my fear then sufficiently muted that I could begin to process the position I'd landed in, Henri’s words floated through the drunken haze.



“The House provides.”



Looking down at the table, the glass was yet again full, and the meaning of that statement sank into my mind. The House could give me a chance to feel my wife’s touch again—hear her voice—see her smile. And it would furnish me with as much alcohol as I wished to drink.



“It brought you here to feed on you.”



But it would also take from me. Sherry was not there to show me real love, and she would not stay to bring me real joy—she was part of The House. I reflected on Henri’s sallow features and wondered what he might have looked like when he first arrived—contemplating who might be handing him the needles in his suite.



“You will never leave here alive.”



And I was going to die there.



I was going to die there…



Studying the room threatening to be my tomb, I caught then something carved into the walls.



Names.



So many names.



So many meals.



A shaking hand darted for the glass again and I dumped more relief into my stomach—pushing the doom as far from my thoughts as I could.



It took seven more doses before I stopped sobbing, replacing horror with tiredness. I lay down on the mattress—somehow more concerned with sleeping than finding a way out of there.

I've always seen them as the adults that took away my childhood, my dreams, my innocence of having pure love, support, they took away my self esteem, my love for myself, they have even taken my tears away- every time i try to stand up for myself, a slap, a hit, a guilt trip me ""we are doing this for you"" ""yk we are proud of you"" ""come here, sorry abt earlier, here you go so u can buy yourself some cookies at school""- FUCK, SOME COOKIES WONT FIX THE AMOUNT OF MENTAL ABUSE I'VE ENDURED IM TIRED WHERE I GO PPL PAINT YOU AS ANGELS WHEN IN MY LIFE U ARE HELL ON EARTH. IM TIRED OF EVERYONE TELLING ME TO ALWAYS LOVE YOU. WHY WHY WHY WHY WOULD I LOVE YOU WHEN YOU GUYS HAVE NEVER SHOW ME LOVE...the one who did is gone- and though sometimes i feel dead i need to live for her, but i will leave away from you guys, the trophy of the family in 7 months or so will pack her bags and go...

Im sorry to anyone who is reading this- english is my second language, i just rlly needed to let this out, i cant let it out to the people that knows me cus it might bite me in the ass later, but thank you for reading the BS that just a 16 yr old is going thru a day before her 17th bday.

I would love to be your friend!","Did it work? I'm sure it worked if you're reading this! So hi, I'm BlueExodia0. I'm trying to remember back as to why I decided to choose this username, but I guess it was thought of out of boredom lol... Imagine if this was my real name.  I'm sure would be super annoying to write out on exams over and over and the teachers would have gotten a heart attack. At least people wouldn't butcher it like how they tend to do with my real name. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 28 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life - someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

If so, what path do I take? Or is the issue my mindset? ","Life has not worked out at all like I had hoped it would. 

As a child, I was diagnosed with Autism/PDD, Auditory and Language Processing Disorders, Dysgraphia, epilepsy, and a speech delay/impairment. Later, as a teenager, I was diagnosed with Major Depression and struggled with self-harm, which I have continued to struggle with for the last 20 years. As an adult, I am currently recovering from psychosis. I still struggle with a lot of different tasks. Talking, speaking, and maintaining conversations are challenging; I can barely sign my name because I can't easily hold a writing utensil; and I can't seem to make friends. 

Although I was always told I was R-word (it is censored on many subreddits) and always failed at everything in school, I have always had dreams of being an entomologist, a cartographer, or some other specialist. But on my 18th birthday, my dad shot himself, our house was repossessed, and I ended up homeless, living on the streets, which put a damper on my plans for higher education. 

As part of a program to help poor and disabled people, I obtained the equivalent of a CDL (I am in Canada) to drive trucks; I took it and started working as a truck driver in Canada to support myself. Then, after a significant accident, I went to a private career college (not a university) for a 1-year diploma in software development (mainly C# and SQL). Unfortunately, I could never find a CS-related job, so I am stuck working in trucking. I'm not a driver anymore; I work in the office as a supervisor since I have trucking experience and office skills. 

The fact that I don't have a degree makes me feel like a worthless loser. A degree is the minimum requirement for everything in life. I need a degree to do anything besides sales (which I am sure I would excel at considering my conversation difficulties) or truck driving. Even my own ""hobbies"" are meaningless without a degree. In 2022, I published a book on the right of peoples to self-determination and remedial secession under international law (my personal library contains over 2,000 paperback and hardcover nonfiction books; I read a lot). My book means nothing because no publisher would consider it without a corresponding law or history degree. Since no publisher will consider it, no bookstore will stock it besides Amazon, where I self-published it, significantly reducing its marketability/availability and value. I'll never be a ""serious"" author or writer. My book will only ever amount to interesting coffee table décor since no one will ever read it or care. 

I want to be an intelligent, respected, and educated professional, not an uneducated loser who fails at life and has achieved nothing. However, I don't know what path to take to fix my life. 

Do I return to school? This scares me. 

Firstly, am I smart enough to attend university? With all my learning disabilities and history of doing poorly at everything (I even failed truck driving school twice), I am not sure I am smart enough for a university-level education. 

Secondly, would a degree actually help me? All I ever see are posts by people with impressive degrees struggling to find jobs. Indeed, I hire people with Master's Degrees to work as truck drivers because they can't find jobs. What if I pursue a degree and end up back where I am or worse? 

Is this a mindset issue? Am I a failure? 

I make around 70K working in an office.   
I have around 20K cash saved up as a ""rainy day"" fund.   
I am married (she has a Master's Degree--and I make more than she does; see above concerns).   
I am taking a six-week trip to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Qatar, and the UAE in a few months.   
I published a book even though nobody reads it. 

Is a degree the right path? Is it a worthwhile investment? Am I a failure? I feel lost and confused. My ""path"" feels wrong, but I don't know the right one.

The unit has a fan that blows from the top, and blows into the apartment. I'm really uncertain what sort of curtain to do, and am considering these:

* floor length (sheer+blackout):
   * would look nice, but when closed the HVAC won't be able to blow into the unit, obstructing cooling/heating
* window length (sheer+blackout): 
   * doesn't look as nice, but the HVAC isn't as blocked (depending how close the curtains are to the window and how far above the unit they are, it could still obstruct it a bit)
* window length sheer, floor length blackout: 
   * might look a bit stupid, but might not be noticeable and would allow some curtain coverage with just the sheers closed
* window length blackout, floor length sheer:
   * not doing this, i think it'd look stupid

I was going to post this little project after the current Star Path had ended, but the Storybook Vale update will almost certainly overshadow everything else for the next month, so I’ve ended it a bit early. Did anyone ask me to do this? No, I was inspired by a statistics class I’m taking. Will anyone care that I have? You all will have to tell me, I suppose.

I was inspired by the Star Path tasks related to collecting memories, and wondered “What is the best way to gather memories?” So here I am, answering that very question. I have grinded (ground?) these tasks so that you don’t have to waste your own time!

I have categorized each memory-giving task from most memory spawns to least, divided the appropriate ones by biome or plant, and specified if one particular spot provided more memories than the others. I hope you all find this interesting because it’s actually been very fun to test! For those who don’t find the overall breakdown interesting, I am putting a much simpler breakdown at the top so you can still get an idea of the percentages.

**Disclaimers:**

1.  I have not played the game every single day this Star Path, and despite my best efforts to keep things even, may have done some tasks more than others. Please do not take this as 100% accurate, your play-style may have yielded different results had you done this same project.

2.  I do not plant huge gardens! I am not a coin grinder, and prefer to collect coins and do things as I go to keep the game interesting, so the gardens have been kept smaller to get what I believe is a more accurate result. You may believe differently, that is perfectly okay!

3.  This is base-game only! I do not have the Rift in Time expansion, there will be nothing here about time-bending, collecting scraps, or any of those animals/plants.

4.  I have not included whether or not these memories gave coins or actual memories, as there is no accurate way to quantify that for people who have more/fewer memories collected than I do. I have also not included plants and animals for which the number is 0, in order to make this post shorter. If you do not see it listed, that is because it produced no memories.

***TLDR:***

**Overall Total:** 48 memories  
**Mining:** 14 memories, 29.2%  
**Fishing:** 11 memories, 22.9%  
**Harvesting:** (Fruit Trees/Bushes): 7 memories, 14.6%

I had just gotten out of a 4 year relationship back in July, and just started talking to some new people. 

One guy and I clicked and we met, and there's alot of things I'm attracted too, but also alot of things I'm put off by.. for one he's younger, which doesn't really bother me, it's just a noticing factor and he's at a different stage of life than me. 

He started off good when we went for coffee and he is very understanding of me and has told me out loud that he doesn't condone smoking weed daily like I do, but he knows that's not his business Persay as long as I'm not hurtiing myself or others. 

We went to my place and we cuddled for a bit,and that's when things started to get a little clingy.. I'm usually a clingy person but 4 years of trauma does somethings to ya, and like first date kinda thing.. it was a little much with trying to like physically move me on him to cuddle and stuff. Idk.

We we kissed and made out a bit, which was okay, however when it comes to tongue, I'd much rather you NOT be shoving your entire tongue into my mouth..

Nothing better than unwinding with some good food, warm company. I’m looking for someone who finds enjoyment in these simple and small connections.

Me:

* Not from the Big 4
* Can be talkative
* Average looking, you be the judge of that. But sometimes they say I'm cute. Tries to be expressive
* Average body but currently works out, stands at 5'5
* I love to cook and bake
* Gaming, TV and Film nerd. **(What's your favorite game, movie or series?)**
* Aside from enjoying coffee, I like drinking milk tea as well or non-alcoholic drinks
* Not a drinker anymore nor do I tend to smoke
* Lives in the east but close to the Metro Manila
* Up for some phone calls
* Commutes most of the time, don't ask me if I have a car or can pick you up

What I'm looking for isn't really strict, if we can meet halfway or don't compromise, we're all good

About you:

* You're someone along the Metro (Metro Manila). As long as I can reach it, or we can meet halfway it will be fine. Places like around Ortigas, Marikina can do as well.
* Can be a food buddy
* Someone who is open for both NSFW and SFW

You, on the other hand, will.

You know, there’s something called “plausible deniability.”

You should be thanking me.

These are the only mammals on Earth that have evolved to feed exclusively on blood.

So in order to drink it, these bats produce saliva that contains unique anticoagulants.

So your theory is, if you can successfully splice vampire genes into your DNA, it would allow your body to produce those same anticoagulants.

MICHAEL: Yes.

It would be a cure.

At what cost?

The fusion of different species is a legacy we already carry in our bodies.

Viruses insinuating their nucleic acid onto our own over hundreds of thousands of years.

That’s evolution. This is different.

# Training

2024 has been an awesome season for me, I had a great race at Tokyo in the Spring breaking 3 hours for the first time, and setting a 7 minute PR.  I've also ran 3 halves and have continued to make steady progress (1:21 -> 1:20 -> 1:19), as well as two 5ks (17:46, 17:39).

Coming out of Tokyo, I wanted to continue to build my fitness by running another marathon in the fall.  I also made the decision to start working with a coach this training cycle.  Prior to this, I've used Pfitz marathon plans (18/55 and 18/70 twice), and Daniels's 2Q 70 mile plan.  In all honesty, my main reason for working with a coach was curiosity.  I haven't struggled with motivation, nutrition, and haven't yet hit any significant fitness plateau.  I really wanted to see what a coach could offer in terms of helping structure my season to set myself up for success, and helping identify what things I should be working on to make myself a better runner.

I did a bit of research online (mainly here and a little on LetsRun) and saw a good number of posts that recommended McKirdy coaching.  I reached out to their head coach and we briefly chatted about my goals and he recommended a few different coaches that he thought would be a good fit for me.  After that, I met with my coach and talked about my running background a bit, what races I was already thinking of for the remainder of the year, and what goals I had in mind (if any).  McKirdy uses the V.02 app for planning workouts/weekly schedules, which was great for me since I was already using it when training for Tokyo using the Daniels 2Q plan.

My coach helped me identify a few ideas for fall marathons that generally have favorable weather are known to be fast courses.  Richmond wasn't on that list :) I wanted to run something in November due to some planned vacation time in October, and was debating between Philly/Richmond.  I read a few race reports here and everyone seemed to have positive things to say about the race, and it was a pretty affordable flight/stay coming from Chicago.

Structure wise, my training was broken into two parts: a 7 week build for a half marathon in August (Hidden Gem half in Floosmoor, IL), and then a 10 week build leading up to Richmond.  Generally speaking, most weeks followed a structure very similar to the Daniels plans I've used in the past: 2 quality sessions per week with the remainder of the week's mileage running easy.  Most weeks here were 58-65 MPW.  I ran a lot of threshold miles, with some of the longer runs mixing in time at marathon pace.  I ended up catching a really bad cold (probably COVID despite testing negative) the week before my goal half.  This is the one of the first points where I really noticed the value of having a coach.  In the past, I'd usually stubbornly try to run through sickness, convincing myself that it's likely nothing serious.  Coach said absolutely not, take the rest of the week off and rest, you're not doing yourself any favors running when you feel like garbage.  I still felt a little off during the week of the race, but managed to run sub 1:20 for the first time and had a very strong race.

After the half, I had a call with my coach and we adjusted my VDOT score upwards based on the race result.  He also told me that's where the 10 week build would start; weekly mileage would go up, long runs would get longer, and nutrition needs would increase.  Most weeks from hereon were 65-70 miles.  Nearly all of my long runs had segments at marathon pace, threshold pace, or a combination of the two.  Something new I hadn't done in a marathon block was running long sections at M + 20s/mile.  These runs were very challenging, especially because I think my VDOT score has overestimated my marathon ability in the past when set based on my half times.  As an example, one of these runs was intended to be 18 miles at 6:40 min/mile.  I don't think at the time I was capable of running a 2:46 marathon, but that's what VDOT indicated.  I still completed this run, but failed another 19 miler pretty miserably after mile 11.  Despite that, I had some of my strongest long runs this cycle: 20 miles with (2x5 @ 6:25), 21 miles easy/moderate @ 7:10, 20 miles with 15 @ 6:38.

During the build, I also started experiencing plantar fasciitis for the first time.  I think the cause was primarily calf tightness that I never took the time to address with proper stretching.  The pain from it ranged from a minor annoyance to me noticeably limping around every step after a long run or workout.  It's been a frustrating injury to resolve, although it never significantly impacted my running as I'd find the pain would ease and almost disppear after warming up.  I ended up seeing a PT a couple weeks out from the race and getting some advice on stretches/exercises which have helped a bit.

I did a standard two week taper before the race, reducing mileage to about 60% of peak.  I felt like I was in really good shape going into the taper.  My coach and I had a call just over a week out from the race to discuss a plan and goal time.  We both agreed the VDOT equivalent (\~2:46) I'd been training at was too aggressive, and that 2:50 would make a more sensible goal.

# Pre-race

Richmond is a Saturday race, so I flew in Thursday morning to give myself a little time to check out the city, visit the expo, and relax a bit before the race.  I stayed at an Airbnb about a half mile from the race start, near the edge of the VCU campus.  The marathon expo is at a Nascar race track just a few miles outside the city.  I hadn't rented a car, but there was a convenient shuttle bus from a nearby hotel offered for free.  After the expo, I remembered I have a coworker in the area and was able to meet up for a drink and get some good shakeout route/food tips.

Friday AM I went for a shakeout run and got a little lost trying to get to Belle Isle.  I also psyched myself out a bit as my 4.5 mile run clocked in at just under 400 feet of elevation. If Richmond is really this hilly, how in the world would I even finish the race let alone run sub 2:50?  I decided to cast these doubts aside and distract myself with carbs.  Found some amazing giant oatmeal cream pie cookies from Shyndigz and got a veggie lasagna from a fresh pasta shop I passed by.  I spent the afternoon chilling at the Airbnb and indulging in said pasta/cookies.

Race morning I set my alarm for 4, 3 hours before race start.  Had some coffee, a peanut butter sandwich, a granola bar, and a serving of LMNT drink mix.  I left my Airbnb just after 6 and was at the race area by 6:10. Bahtroom lines were non-existent at this point so I took advantage, headed over to gear check, and then did some light dynamic stretches.  By this point bahtroom lines were somewhat long, so I got in line to go one last time before race start.  I was in the corral by 6:40am, and it wasn't too congested.  I was able to position myself a little bit in front of the 3:00 pace group, and there were maybe 100ish runners in front of me.

Wheelchair race went off just a couple minutes before 7, and then we were off!

# Race

Miles 1-6: My goal here was to stay relaxed and avoid surging pace or weaving around.  This section of the course is relatively flat with some very gradual hills at mile 4.  I did a pretty good job staying patient and relaxed here with most miles in the mid 6:30s.  I also briefly ran into another coach from the same coaching group that was running the race.  Turns out we were both targeting a similar time, so I ran alongside her and a couple others briefly.  I pulled away a little bit from the group and decided it was best to run my own race.  I took my first gel at mile 3.5.

Miles 7-12: After mile 6, there was a signicant downhill of about 100 feet.  My coach cautioned me to not overdo the downhills and told me to set a ""speed limit"" of 6:20 to avoid overtaxing the quads.  Others definitely took advantage here as I got passed by a decent number of others running sub 6 pace.  I think it was wise here for me to hold back, as my training entailed virtually no hills.  This part of the course was pretty tricky for me, and was when I started to doubt myself quite a bit.  I started feeling what felt like the beginning of a cramp in both my left calf and my right quad at various points.  Each time this feeling crept up, I scaled back my effort ever so slightly.  This section butts up against the James river and features a decent amount of rolling elevation change.  It was also at this point in the race (maybe around mile 10) where there was direct sun exposure.  Temps were pretty comfortable at around 50f, but I definitely noticed myself sweating on the uphills with the sun beaming directly into my eyes.  Glad I had my sunglasses here.  There is a pretty decent climb up to mile 12 which had me split above 6:40 for the first time.  I took my second gel at mile 7, and a 40g carb gel at mile 10.

Miles 13-18: Miles 13-15 were a nice reprieve from the last section as they were mostly downhill.  I used this section to recover a bit and was happy to see my heartrate come down a bit.  We passed the half and the clock showed 1:26:07.  At this point I knew 2:50 wasn't likely, especially damning was a conversation I overhead from two others that had ran the race many times and had never managed to run a negative split.  I definitely got passed by a few others here again taking advantage of the nice downhillls.  Looking back, I think I was overly conservative in this section for my A/B goals. My splits from 13-15 were all above 6:30 despite this section being downhill.  I justified this during the race as avoiding muscle fatigue, but aerobically I felt great.  From miles 15-17, the route passes over the James river again going north over a giant highway bridge.  I was just behind several decently sized groups here, and they all seemed to group closer together here and bring the pace up a little bit.  I've read other reports that note this section can be quite windy, making it one of the most challenging parts of the course.  The wind was noticeable here, but didn't add a significant challenge.  I found myself mostly running alone here, not quite able to catch the group of \~10 runners just ahead of me.  One cool thing I noticed here (and later at several other sections of the course) is that there were several volunteer ""coaches"" that were running the opposite direction down the hill, scouting for runners that looked like they were struggling.  The coaches would run alongside these runners to help pace them and encourage them through a rough patch.  I appreciated seeing that in a race and am sure they saved several folks' races.  I took a gel at mile 14, and my last 40g carb gel at mile 17.5.

Miles 19-22: This section is mostly flat aside from some minor rollers.  I was mainly trying to hold it together here and honestly don't remember much of the course.  For some reason I thought the course had significant downhill sections starting at mile 23, so I got by just telling myself I'd make it there and then go all out after 23.  Despite still feeling good aerobically, I continued to avoid pushing it due to tightness in my calf and quad.  I had my last gel at mile 21.

Miles 23-finish: This section of the course had some amazing crowd support.  By this point, the half and full courses had merged with the half marathoners on the left side of the street, and full on the right.  There were lots of folks along the road and outside their houses cheering everyone to finish, which was super helpful in one of the hardest spots of the marathon.  I was definitely feeling rough here, but was waiting for the type of downhill section that I saw earlier around miles 13-15.  There was a brief downhill at mile 24 where I accelerated a bit, but it's followed up with an almost equal climb back up. I hit the 25 mile marker and looking at my watch to see 2:44 and change.  I knew my B goal was in sight, but it was going to be close.  I picked up the pace here a bit and was surprised I could still hold on without cramping.  Finally after passing the 26 mile marker I understood what the ""downhill finish"" was referring to.  This section is a steep 6-9% downhill to the finish, and honestly it was almost impossible to stop from falling over myself as I flew downhill.  I saw the finish line clock from about 100m out at 2:51:4x and sprinted to try and hit 2:52, narrowly missing the mark at 2:52:04.

# Post-race

Can't be mad with a PR, right?  Despite not hitting my A or B goals in this race, I'm still super proud of it.  This course isn't exactly easy, and my last PR was set on a flat course (Tokyo) with ideal weather.  I feel like I raced smart, albeit I might've left some time on the table in doing so.  It's hard to tell if I honestly could've pushed harder, or if my legs would've blown up.  Overall my heart rate was noticeably lower than my last 2 marathons- I typically spend the second half of the race in the 160-165 range.  I didn't hit that until mile 25 this race.

Next up for me is Boston in the Spring.  The obvious focus for me has got to be getting in lots of hills, as my typical long runs in Chicago never exceed 200 feet of elevation gain.  My brain needs to learn to turn ""your quads are about to give out"" into ""bruh it's a 50 ft climb calm down"".

Hopefully this report encourages others to run Richmond - overall it's a very well organized race that the city most definitely comes out to support.

With such a cutback in my calories, I guess I'm disappointed to only see 2lbs in 1 week. Yes, I know that is a safe loss, but being older (36) im wanting to have a baby sooner than later. 

Any tips and tricks to make it work the best? Do I really need to force myself to eat more? I'm working with a nutritionist and she's all about protein, but I just struggle with the protein shakes or coffee. The liquid is just too much.

1gtqize,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gtqize/aitah_for_messaging_my_ex/,AITAH for messaging my ex?,"
So for a little context, before I get into the story: I had had a huge crush on him since I was 15 years old and when I was 17 I finally gathered enough courage to approach him (then 18) by sending a letter to him through our school’s valentines day mail. I said (translated but): “hi, I think you’re really neat and if you are single and interested I’d like to get to know you” and he accepted the offer. 

    So now to the story. We started going out right after valentines day and everything was going well. We were going to different concerts that were happening, going hiking, he was teaching me how to drive and I even attended his high school graduation (he was a senior at the time and his family wasn’t attending, it was chill wasn’t a big deal he invited me last minute). Mid July he told me he loved me and that was around the time when I asked him what we were (it was his first relationship so idk how he thought everything worked because I am the type of girl that would like to be asked to be someone’s girlfriend) and we started officially dating. He got into uni in a nearby town and I started my senior year. 
    
  Now to when he became my ex. I have always been really insecure so when things were going well I started feeling scared of the thought of him breaking things off and or finding someone better in uni. My life hasn’t always been pleasant, my family life is really complicated so when I started dating the guy of my dreams I panicked and wanted out. I tried to explain it to him in the best way but I gave him a really vague (but true) reason as to why I wanted to break up, without hurting him. When he dropped me off after that talk we were both crying so I know I hurt him as well. A few days later he messaged me and asked if we could talk but I never responded. 

   Now I am in my freshman year of uni and I believe I have grown and have become more communicative and less insecure about myself so I am thinking of texting him, however I don’t know if I should. I know I hurt him after seeking him out myself and breaking up with him when he didn’t do anything wrong and ghosting him. 

  So I’m trying to figure out whether it would be selfish of me to reach out to him for a chance of trying again. I have stalked his social media and he doesn’t seem to be dating anyone and he is still following me, so maybe there’s hope? 

  I would also like to add that when we were together I felt myself being able to be the best version of myself and be more active and extroverted when I am usually very introverted. 

  I would reach out to him by messaging him something like: “hi, how are you?” and if he responds and wants to talk to me offer to meet for coffee catch up and explain myself to him even if he would only like to get closure. 

  So, would I be the asshole by messaging him?
Or should I just leave him be?

1gtqint,https://www.reddit.com/r/spinalfusion/comments/1gtqint/starting_to_feel_almost_normal_at_3_months/,Starting to feel almost normal at 3 months,"Yesterday was the 3 month anniversary of my surgery, though I had my X-rays and appointment about 2 weeks ago. I was cleared at that time for lifting (up to 20-25ish pounds he said, but also my 3 year old who weighs a little more than that) and even some bending and twisting.


I'm still cautious about big bends and twists. I still log roll whenever I can. I don't run or jump yet but I've gotten back my naturally swift gait.


I drive. I pick up my kids. I take care of both of them by myself (or as much by myself as life requires for a typical SAHM). I go shopping. I play. I take my kids to the coffee shop (with some assistance for the baby). I change diapers. I cook, I wash dishes, I tidy up as time allows. I can be up walking, standing, sitting, for pretty much as long as I want. My baby who weighs, my guess, 13-15ish pounds by now, took a nap in a carrier on me for 2 hours yesterday. I can lay in a normal bed, though I still prefer the hospital bed. 


I still use the shower chair because I don't feel comfortable bending low enough to wash my legs and feet. I can't use the stroller by myself (it's a big bulky one, not the light umbrella stroller) and I can't lift the carseat with baby in it. I can't do super quick movements like ducking or hopping into bed. I don't toss my daughter in the air like I used to, but I hope to be able to later on. I don't do all of the dance moves I used to, mainly out of caution - again something I hope to get back later.


I use Tylenol and/or ibuprofen (cleared by doc) occasionally if I'm particularly active in a day (i.e. Walmart and trick or treating on the same day). I'm pretty much out of the brace but I do keep it with me just in case, for comfort. 


I have an outpatient PT appointment coming up to hopefully help me get even further toward getting fully back to normal. 


My skin is still weird. Not as much or as widespread as before but there are still spots that are tender, sensitive to pressure, or they get numb and/or itchy, etc. Sometimes I get little pains in my hips or legs, or they fall asleep in odd situations. 


My pain level by the time I decide to take medicine is like a 5 typically, but my usual level is about 1-2 if even that, barely noticeable and doesn't affect my function at all. Before the surgery my best day was a 6 WITH powerful prescription drugs and without doing anything to aggravate it. But it was usually more like a 7 or 8.


I have energy. I have a personality that isn't just pain, drugs, rest all the time. Even more than that I'm really getting back to doing all of the things that make me feel really alive. When I can handle the stroller and carseat by myself, toss my older daughter around, run at full speed, dance, live completely med-free (except my period probably) and I guess just move more quickly and lift more in general, and not have to worry about my back at all anymore, then I'll be back at 100%. But right now I'd say it's a good 80% at least, which to me feels just amazing.

We have decision paralysis and looking for your input and experience with your own machine. Thanks in advance!

We would like the following:
- Ability to pull consistent shots
- Ability to have it serviced/repaired locally
- Good build quality to last 10+ years

Requirements - PID, dual boiler, reasonable heat up time

Location: Sydney, Australia 

Preferred drink types: milk coffee (mainly), espresso

Drink frequency: 1-3 coffees per day per person (total ~4 coffees a day on average)

Space: We're planning on buying a rolling storage cabinet [958mm/38inches (H) x 1260mm/49inches (W) x 530mm/21inches (D)]

Experience: Limited experience with espresso and steaming milk

Shortlisted Candidates:

Espresso machine 
1. Lelit Bianca V3 - was our top choice for a significant time until we visited a dealer and was introduced to other machines. The Rocket and ECM looked better than the Lelit when placed side by side
2. Rocket R58 - until we read about build quality issues 
3. ECM Synchronica II - quicker heat up
4. Profitec Pro 800 - for a different vibe
5. La Marzoccco Linea Mini (LMLM) - we like the aesthetics and the quick heat up time. But concerned about rising cost in parts/service & De'Longhi acquisition

Grinder 
1. Mazzer Philos (I189D) - concerned about some posts regarding build quality and if there will be a V2 to improve on the kinks
2. Turin DF83V
3. Lagom Option O P64 - was our first choice initially but priced highest at AUD 2.6k

I watched several videos, read guides, and like most first timers it was, well shit. 

I know my grind was too fine and will work to find the perfect grind. However, I had two questions on which I've been given conflicting answers.

Should I preheat my porcelain coffee dripper? If so, how? I have a horribly small pathetic kitchen in my living situation that's hard to explain, and it's not coinvent for me to boil water or even run it over hot water as the sink is in another room. (Like I said, bad kitchen)

so, first 2 days were amazing, i had training and all that stuff. i got trained for the first window, i had to cash people out and take orders by the headset but always with my trainer, she was always there for me, english is not my first language so it was really hard to understand what people were ordering and i also was super nervous so my brain couldnt quite understand what was going on with that pos system 😭😂
So everytime I couldnt understand what a customer was saying she was there to help me (first 2 days I only took like 3 orders because i just couldnt really understand anything lol)

then, 2nd day after my break i was sent to the second window to hand orders and prepare the beverages, and i learned a little bit of mccafé and how the sodas machine work and i was feeling a lot more comfortable in there, i was working and doing lots of multitasking and i kinda liked it

3rd day (yesterday) i was sent to the first window ALONE! 
i hated it, i didnt know how to manage taking orders and at the same time telling people how much they have to pay and doing that at the same time 😭😭
i was such a mess, 3 people left because i couldnt take their orders because i just couldnt understand what they were asking, they were asking for deals and some other things and i just couldnt do those on the screen, i was literally praying that what they order was just a large coffee with no cream and no sugar lol.
i felt really bad, cried during my break because i couldnt handle customers getting annoyed by me and being rude and just wanted to quit.

tomorrow i have a new shift and i just dont want to do more first window anymore! i dont know how to let them know about that because i know they need me to train on everything so that i can learn all that a front door person does, but i swear i cannot be sent in there alone at least for a whole month and obv they dont need that, they need just one person on the first window.

i know they are gonna send me there at least for the very first 3 hours until my break and then maybe after my break im gonna be at the second window but i just want to work in that second window forever 😭😭

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

“October 1st 2026 In the house of Billy Turtle and his mother Rosa Turtle, what’s about to take place is one of the most disturbing crimes ever in the city of Haddonfield, Indiana, and yeah, this is more disturbing than the Michael Myers murder spree in the city that ended just 4 years ago. 

“Hey Billy” “What do you want, mom?” “Why don’t we go outside and play for a bit?"" “You just want me off the computer and outside so you can lock me out and look at porn. I’m not dumb, mom."" ""No, no, Billy, that’s not what I want to do to you; I want to have a fun time outside with you."" ""Oh, really remember the last time we went outside?” “no” “Let me remind you why then."" 



“Mom, can you unlock the door? It's 10 degrees out here."" ""Damn, that man has a nice dick."" “Momma, can you let me in, please?"" “Oh my god, what do you want? You interrupted my masturbation time?” “Can you let me back in?” “Maybe” ""Oh, come on, mom. You used to love me, but ever since dad left, you’ve only been a porn machine."" “We don’t talk about him. I told you that Billy, now get inside."" “Now to remind me of your dad, I get to spank you 20 times, and you have to sleep outside like a dog."" “Ok mom” “Now lay on your back and pull your pants down so I can see your butt."" “ SPank SPank SPank SPank SPank SPank SPank SPank SPank SPank SPank SPank SPank SPank SPank "" “Now get outside.""

“I’m not taking any more of this."" “Goodbye, Billy. I will never miss you. Don’t be safe, Billy. Hahahah."" “That’s it” “Wait, Billy, what are you doing?"" “I’ve had enough of you."" “Runs over to his mother super fast."" “Wa-wait, Billy, why do you have a knife?"" Billy put the knife down. """"No, you sick bastard, it’s your fault. My mental health was already gone even before dad left.” ""Billy, don’t hurt me. I love you."" “Shut the fuck up; I don’t want to hear it.""“



Billy stabs his mom three times, then brings her to the basement."" “This won’t hurt, Oh, trust me.” “Billy then starts to cut his mom open; blood is everywhere."" “Now I’m going to get revenge by turning you into an actual dog, and here I was thinking you were the evil one.” “Hey mom, how are you feeling?"" “Bark bark.” “It worked, and I got my revenge on her. Woooooooooooooooo! Suck on it, mom.”

“That was 12-year-old Billy. Now unfortunately, Billy's mom didn’t care about him that much after his dad left 6 years ago, which led her down the road to porn and Billy down the road to murder. In the city of Haddonfield, there remains all but one human and about 300 dogs.”

Market analysis indicates that these exceptional stones, representing just 0.00001% of all gem-quality diamonds, command prices starting at $90,000 for a low quality stone and crossing the $300,000 mark for higher gradings.

Lab-grown diamonds have turned this exceptional size to much more affordable, starting at $18,000 - a 80% price difference resulting in a $2,500 per carat. However these lab diamonds aren’t as common in the market and finding a good one requires a deep research and understanding.

This definitive acquisition guide provides sophisticated strategies for the 7 carat market, including historic documentation protocols, institutional valuation methodologies, and expert insights for building multi-generational diamond portfolios in this pinnacle category.

# Bottom Line

A 7-carat diamond is an exceptional and rare gemstone that comes with a hefty price tag and specific considerations. Here's what you need to know:

* Expect to invest at least $200,000 for a balanced 7-carat natural diamond, or $300,000 for premium grades
* Alternatively, you can get a premium 7.00 carat with D colorless and extremely high VVS clarity for around $28,000. A similar natural diamond would cost you around $400,000 - a 93% price gap. 
* Be cautious of deals that seem too good to be true.
* Choose settings carefully to enhance and protect the stone
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing from trusted retailers that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

Book Title: Thirsty

# Chapter 1

It was universally acknowledged that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. In Michael’s experience, this seemed to hold mostly true however it seemed to him that all the ‘good’ actions landed neatly on one lot of people—those perpetually lucky, golden ones who breezed through life collecting wins and effortless smiles—while all the corresponding ‘bad’ reactions piled up on people like him. In fact, he’d lived most of his life quite sure that he belonged firmly in the ‘opposite reaction’ category. For every person who had things fall into place, someone in his category ended up getting royally screwed over.

But in his early twenties, something strange and entirely unearned happened. He’d gotten word that his estranged mother—the same one who had vanished from his life ages ago—had left, to him, her flat in Cardiff. Just like that. A real flat, all his, in his name, with walls, doors, and absolutely no mortgage. It was the sort of luck he had only ever observed from afar, the kind that happened to *other* people. Naturally, he found it suspicious. Michael had always believed that the universe didn’t hand out free flats without expecting a monumental, earth-shattering payback somewhere down the line. Surely there was some cosmic catch—some vast, impending backlash waiting in the wings to level him in the name of universal balance.

And so, he’d made it his business to stay well under the cosmic radar ever since. He figured if he kept his head down—avoiding work, responsibility, and most of all, people—then maybe, just maybe, fate would give him a free pass on this one. He had no plans to stand out, take risks, or remind the universe that he existed in any noticeable way. After all, the best way to dodge bad luck was to make yourself as invisible as possible. If life wanted to deal him a blow, it would have to find him first.

For the most part, Michael’s kept his lifestyle predictable, even neatly balanced.

His nights and mornings ran like clockwork— a particularly cheap, poorly made clock with a button missing, but a clock nevertheless. But today, he suspected he was feeling the effects of more than his usual pints. Today, he wasn’t just waking up to his standard morning payback. No, this morning, life had clearly decided that he was due for a double helping of cosmic funk.

He groaned, peeling his eyes open, only to be greeted by a room that seemed offensively bright. His tongue, meanwhile, had taken on the texture of an old rubber boot, and his eyes throbbed as if a cavern had formed behind them.

Michael was used to a hangover; in fact, he welcomed it, in the cosmic sense. But today felt different, as though someone had stolen something vital from his brain—taken the whole pot of honey and left behind a jar of bees with an IOU scrawled on the lid.

He lay for a moment, staring at the ceiling, fully prepared to stay there for the rest of the day, if not the rest of his life. It was only then that he realised that he was the *thirstiest* he'd ever been in his life. Like SO thirsty. His body was possibly in negative water content. He reluctantly, and with great effort, sat up giving his best impression of a rusty hinge. For a moment, he simply blinked, waiting to see if the world might kindly come into focus. When it didn’t, he staggered to his feet, willing himself forward, one step at a time on a pilgrimage to the kitchenette.

After pinballing down the hallway and past the box room, he fell into the kitchenette and spotted, with great relief, his trusty mug glinting with life-saving liquid inside. Through the brain fog, he couldn’t help but feel a flicker of pride for drunk Michael, who had, in a rare moment of foresight, left it out for him. Had it been placed in the bedroom, it would have actually been useful, but no point splitting hairs right now.

He reached for the cup, already anticipating the joy of soaking up that lovely, transparent liquid; but as he grasped it, the handle detached with a resigned snap. The mug itself executed a graceful pirouette, its contents spinning in a tragic arc, before shattering in the sink and scattering ceramic shards like confetti at the world’s saddest wedding.

""Brilliant,"" he muttered.

Undeterred, he reached into the cupboard for his only glass and held it under the tap. He could practically feel the cool water soothing his parched throat now.

He turned the tap with eager hope, but as if the universe was conspiring against him, nothing happened. Not a drop, not even the courtesy of a gurgle or splutter as it tried to produce *something*.

""Seriously?"" he groaned, staring at the tap in disgust.

Desperation mounting, he tried the hot tap, but it was as dry as his wit. At this point, he’d drink anything—*anything*—even water that tasted like old pipes. Or… old flowers. He glanced at the wilting vase on the windowsill, its desiccated blooms drooping like they, too, had given up on life.

  
Chapter 1

It was universally acknowledged that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. In Michael’s experience, this seemed to hold mostly true however it seemed to him that all the ‘good’ actions landed neatly on one lot of people—those perpetually lucky, golden ones who breezed through life collecting wins and effortless smiles—while all the corresponding ‘bad’ reactions piled up on people like him. In fact, he’d lived most of his life quite sure that he belonged firmly in the ‘opposite reaction’ category. For every person who had things fall into place, someone in his category ended up getting royally screwed over.

But in his early twenties, something strange and entirely unearned happened. He’d gotten word that his estranged mother—the same one who had vanished from his life ages ago—had left him her flat in Cardiff. Just like that. A real flat, all his, in his name, with walls, doors, and absolutely no mortgage. It was the sort of luck he had only ever observed from afar, the kind that happened to *other* people. Naturally, he found it suspicious. Michael had always believed that the universe didn’t hand out free flats without expecting a monumental, earth-shattering payback somewhere down the line. Surely there was some cosmic catch—some vast, impending backlash waiting in the wings to level him in the name of universal balance.

And so, he’d made it his business to stay well under the cosmic radar ever since. He figured if he kept his head down—avoiding work, responsibility, and most of all, people—then maybe, just maybe, fate would give him a free pass on this one. He had no plans to stand out, take risks, or remind the universe that he existed in any noticeable way. After all, the best way to dodge bad luck was to make yourself as invisible as possible. If life wanted to deal him a blow, it would have to find him first.

For the most part, Michael’s kept his lifestyle predictable, even neatly balanced.

His nights and mornings ran like clockwork— a particularly cheap, poorly made clock with a button missing, but a clock nevertheless. But today, he suspected he was feeling the effects of more than his usual pints. Today, he wasn’t just waking up to his standard morning payback. No, this morning, life had clearly decided that he was due for a double helping of cosmic funk.

He groaned, peeling his eyes open, only to be greeted by a room that seemed offensively bright. His tongue, meanwhile, had taken on the texture of an old rubber boot, and his eyes throbbed as if a cavern had formed behind them.

Michael was used to a hangover; in fact, he welcomed it, in the cosmic sense. But today felt different, as though someone had stolen something vital from his brain—taken the whole pot of honey and left behind a jar of bees with an IOU scrawled on the lid.

He lay for a moment, staring at the ceiling, fully prepared to stay there for the rest of the day, if not the rest of his life. It was only then that he realised that he was the thirstiest he'd ever been in his life. Like SO thirsty. His body was possibly in negative water content. He reluctantly, and with great effort, sat up giving his best impression of a rusty hinge. For a moment, he simply blinked, waiting to see if the world might kindly come into focus. When it didn’t, he staggered to his feet, willing himself forward, one step at a time on a pilgrimage to the kitchenette.

After pinballing down the hallway and past the box room, he fell into the kitchenette and spotted, with great relief, his trusty mug glinting with life-saving liquid inside. Through the brain fog, he couldn’t help but feel a flicker of pride for drunk Michael, who had, in a rare moment of foresight, left it out for him. Had it been placed in the bedroom, it would have actually been useful, but no point splitting hairs right now.

He reached for the cup, already anticipating the joy of soaking up that lovely, transparent liquid; but as he grasped it, the handle detached with a resigned snap. The mug itself executed a graceful pirouette, its contents spinning in a tragic arc, before shattering in the sink and scattering ceramic shards like confetti at the world’s saddest wedding.

""Brilliant,"" he muttered.

Undeterred, he reached into the cupboard for his only glass and held it under the tap. He could practically feel the cool water soothing his parched throat now.

He turned the tap with eager hope, but as if the universe was conspiring against him, nothing happened. Not a drop, not even the courtesy of a gurgle or splutter as it tried to produce *something*.

""Seriously?"" he groaned, staring at the tap in disgust.

Desperation mounting, he tried the hot tap, but it was as dry as his wit. At this point, he’d drink anything—*anything*—even water that tasted like old pipes. Or… old flowers. He glanced at the wilting vase on the windowsill, its desiccated blooms drooping like they, too, had given up on life.



He scanned the room, grasping at options. The vase? Empty, save for a heap of brittle petals. The “guest mug” on the coffee table? Dusty, with a dry ring that might have once been coffee in the age of shoulder pads. Forgotten bottles? Half-finished drinks? The room offered nothing but a bleak, unbroken desert of dryness.

His gaze drifted to the bathroom door. The toilet cistern? Well… no. Not yet.

“Right,” he sighed. “Time to brave the great outdoors.”

He pulled on yesterday's jeans, conveniently crumpled on the floor where he'd left them. A quick check confirmed his wallet was still in the pocket—a minor victory in a morning full of defeats. He grabbed a somewhat clean shirt from the 'less dirty' pile and slipped on his battered trainers.

Stepping out into the midday sun, he felt as though he’d strolled straight into an oven preheated specifically for his inconvenience. It was a rare, spiteful kind of heat, the sort that sat on the pavement and waited for someone like him to emerge. Were it not for the pitiful shade offered by his mop of curly hair and a sun-bleached cap, he was fairly certain he’d combust on the spot.

Michael closed the door behind him and walked across to the external steps, each one was probably hot enough to fry an egg and the metal railing felt alarmingly close to melting. Just as he reached the last step, he heard it—the low, menacing growl that meant the ground floor’s most unsavoury resident, Bastard, had spotted him.

Every day, without fail, that beast seemed to consider Michael’s descent an act of war. It snarled and snapped from behind a hastily constructed “garden” fence that the neighbours had claimed as their own, complete with this rabid, territorial monster who apparently viewed him as an intruder.

Michael, in turn, had given up trying to reason with it. He stuck to his strategy of sidestepping its snapping jaws, jumping back just as it lunged and, once clear, muttering, “Yeah, you too, mate.”

With a resigned sigh, he made his way onto the street. It was *hot.* An oppressive, sticky heat that sapped any motivation he might have had to walk further than absolutely necessary. Normally, he’d head to the cheaper shops, the ones a few streets over, where he could save a bit and console himself with the knowledge that he’d eked a few extra pence out of his dwindling budget. But today? No, today, he was headed for the nearest corner shop, the one that, he suspected, charged him extra just for the convenience of being closer.

“Just get the water, get back home,” he muttered. Home, where the brightest thing he’d have to face was the faint glow of his ancient, secondhand television. It was the only sane plan, and one that even in his current state, he shouldnt be able to fuck up.

The universe however, forever the prankster, was already drafting its punchline.



# Chapter 2

Michael dragged himself into the shop, a visible sigh of relief escaping his parched lips as he spotted the coveted shelf of water. The shop owner, Mr. Choudhry eyed him with suspicion but offered an acknowledging nod and the British smile.

As he approached the shelf and grabbed a bottle of water, he noticed an alarming lack of price tags amid the shelves in the fridge. Typical. He braced himself for whatever Mr. Choudhry felt was the “going rate” for essential hydration, deciding that, today, even daylight robbery would be a price worth paying.

Michael joined the small queue behind a large man whose sweat glistened across his neck and shoulders in a pattern that could have passed for a relief map of some unknown, swampy region. Without meaning to, Michael found himself watching the droplets form on the man’s pink skin, then merge into each other until they became too heavy and slid down slowly into his, once white, vest.

Mesmerised, Michael realised he was leaning forward, dangerously close to discovering what those droplets actually tasted like. Wide eyed, he snapped himself upright, quickly putting his tongue away, and gripped the bottle of water tighter than a nun with her rosary beads—and, he suspected, much for the same reason.

Finally, as the large man huffed away, it was Michael’s turn. He stepped up to the counter, his prized bottle trembling slightly in his grasp. Mr. Choudhry took it, scanned it, and then gave Michael a look—somewhere between polite indifference and the mild disdain he reserved for beggars—before begrudgingly returning  Michael’s half-smile.

""£1.99."" Said Mr Choudhry in a deadpan tone.

Had his eyes been properly hydrated, Michael would have rolled them at the blatant profiteering. A heat wave was practically a goldmine to the likes of Mr. Choudhry. He reached into his wallet, only to find it depressingly empty. He must have blown the last of his cash last night. Brilliant.

Fumbling in his wallet, he cleared his throat. ""Can I pay by card?"" he asked, with as much hope as he could muster.

Mr. Choudhry squinted at him. “Need to spend more,” he said, tapping the £3 minimum sign and giving Michael a look of deep suspicion as though next he might ask if he could pay with Monopoly money.

Michael quickly snatched a packet of chewing gum from the counter display and slid it across. He briefly considered going back to the fridge for a second water, but a small queue was forming behind him, and he couldn’t risk any further delay. He was *so* thirsty.

The card machine beeped, and Michael held his breath, waiting for the shopkeeper’s nod to signal he could finally take his purchase and leave.

Declined.

“Try again?” Michael asked, more plea than question. The shopkeeper silently obliged.

Declined.

“Fuck,” Michael muttered, half to himself. “Sorry… I’ll put it back.”

He shuffled back to the shelf, clutching the bottle like it was the last lifeline between him and dehydration-induced oblivion. He hesitated. 

*He was so thirsty.* 

It wouldn’t hurt anyone, would it? Just one bottle of water. Hands shaking, he slipped it into his pocket. He walked out of the shop, hand in pocket, heart pounding. He didn’t look back, though he could feel Mr. Choudhry’s eyes burning holes in his back.

Outside, he kept his head down and circled around to the back of the shop. He was beside himself about what he’d just done. *He didn't steal*. He was a loser and would take a freebie with the best of them but he didn't steal.

Pulling out the bottle as soon as he was out of sight. He fumbled with the cap, which, in a final insult from the universe, was tighter than a miser's grip on his last coin. Just as he managed to crack the lid and raise the bottle, Mr. Choudhry rounded the corner, eyes narrowed.

The shopkeeper slapped the bottle out of his hand, sending water splattering onto the dusty ground, where it was quickly soaked up by the unforgiving earth.

""You fucking thief! Fuck off away from my shop before I call the police!"" Mr. Choudhry snarled, pointing a finger at the street like it could summon an officer instantly.

""I, I'm really sorry, Mr. Choudhry,"" Michael mumbled, staggering toward the disappearing puddle. ""I'm just... *really* thirsty.""

Mr. Choudhry, his finger still pointed like a weapon, aimed it again at Michael. “Yes, well, maybe if you didn’t spend all your money on the fucking beers, you’d have enough for water!” He looked Michael up and down. “And soap!”

As Mr. Choudhry advanced on Michael with a loaded finger raised; he stood on what looked to be a blackened grease trail from the takeaway next door. His eyes had barely time to widen in shock as his foot swung out from under him narrowly missing Michaels face in a sweep that would have gotten an approving nod from a fly-half. In a spectacular display of gravity, the momentum of that leg took the other with it, and he slammed into the ground with a horrible *thunk*. There was a sickening noise as his neck gouged open on a ragged bit of metal sticking out from the handrail of the fire exit. It was probably the one Health & Safety had mentioned on their last inspection but Choudhry had ignored. He hit the flagstones with all the grace of a dropped sack of potatoes, blood pouring from the newly opened hole in his carotid artery.

Michael stood and froze, hands in the air as if caught mid-crime—though to be fair, he *had* just stolen a bottle of water. He stared at the pool of blood spreading quickly, the dark red contrasting sharply against the dusty ground.

He frowned. Biting his lip as if making a difficult decision. *He was so thirsty.*

With a growing sense of inevitability, Michael slowly got down onto his hands and knees. His lips hovered just above the blood, and with a hesitant breath, he dipped down and took a drink. It wasn’t what he’d planned. But god, it quenched that relentless thirst. His eyes closed as the warm liquid soothed his parched throat.

He sucked up the entire puddle, the thirst finally fading. Smacking his lips, Michael stood up, feeling remarkably refreshed. The shopkeeper now lay motionless, drained of all colour—both literally and figuratively. His skin had turned a shade of grey that would make a ghost look sun-kissed.

Michael stared down at Mr. Choudhry’s lifeless body, blood still on his lips, then turned and bolted down the alleyway.

Rounding the first corner, Michael slowed from a sprint to a brisk walk, passing through that awkward half-jog that made him look as though he’d either strained something or, more likely, shat himself. He suspected his gait was now projecting the latter.

Regardless, he knew he needed to get away from here as quickly as possible. He headed straight up the road the way he’d come–only to realise mere metres later, that if anyone *was* watching, they’d now see him walking directly toward his flat. Hardly the stealthy getaway he’d hoped for.

At the next corner, he took an over exaggerated left turn that no peeping Tom could’ve missed, striding on with a newfound nonchalance. Partly, he supposed, because he’d slowed his pace. But also because, to his own surprise, he wasn’t actually nervous about it.

Unbelievably, he actually felt… well, *good*. Not just ‘*hangover’s finally gone* good’, but ‘*could handle anything the day threw at him’* good. Which was odd, really, considering he’d just downed a drink in possibly the worst way imaginable. Sure, he knew he’d had a belter of a hangover, but should he feel *this* good after quenching his thirst? Or was it the way in which he’d done it? Maybe he was high on some strange survival hormone currently coursing through his veins. Or was there something about blood that did this to a man?

Then again… could it just be *Mr. Choudhry’s* blood? Perhaps he’d had one too many happy pills that morning. No, he corrected himself, it couldn’t be that. Not with his face.

Without realising it, he’d made it almost all the way home. He’d taken a few unnecessary turns along the way—why, he had no idea. Perhaps he’d thought it would throw off any invisible pursuers, or maybe he just hadn’t wanted to seem like he was making a direct escape. Or perhaps, most likely, he was simply in too much of a daze to walk in a straight line. The sight of his front door felt like an oasis in the desert, or possibly a bunker at the end of a battlefield. In truth, it was neither—it was just a battered old door with peeling paint and a lock that jammed on Thursdays. But today, it looked like the most reassuring thing in the world.

“*WOOF!*” went Bastard, stretching over the fence to snap at Michael as he approached the stairs.

“For fuck’s sake!” Michael yelped as his heart rate rocketed back up to a hundred miles an hour.

Clutching his chest for comfort, he staggered up the stairs and wrestled his key into the door. The familiar, slightly musty smell of home greeted him, and he let out a long, shaky breath as he shut the world firmly on the other side of it. He dropped onto the brown settee, which creaked obligingly under him, and stared at the blank TV screen.

For once, he was glad it was switched off.

He leaned back and closed his eyes, hoping that somewhere on the inside of his eyelids, some celestial administrator had scribbled a note explaining exactly what the hell had just happened. Something like: *“Congratulations, Michael, you’ve discovered the secret of eternal life. Good luck with that.”* But no. All he got was the usual show of purple and green swirls, dancing around with the vague enthusiasm of leftover static. Not helpful in the slightest.

After a while, he stood up with a sigh, hands on hips, scanning the room for answers that weren’t there. *Surely* he should be nervous, right? People got nervous about far smaller things than drinking blood off the dirt. People had been known to have existential crises over a bad haircut or the wrong colour wallpaper. And yet here he was, as calm as if he’d just come back from the shops.

Michael gave a cautious glance out the window, half-expecting to find flashing lights and raised eyebrows, but the street was as quiet as ever. He closed the curtain. The logical thing to do now, he decided, was to make a cup of tea. 

*oh, right.* 

Well with that plan out the window he flicked the TV on and flipped through the five available channels. No news. Nothing about dead shopkeepers. *Well it had only just happened*, he supposed. 

He sat back down, but moments later was up again, pacing back and forth. Anxiety had been such an integral part of his life up to this point that he felt distinctly unmoored without it. Surely he should be doing *something*. But what?

He glanced over at his old mobile phone, silent as always. No calls, no texts—not that there ever were. He wasn’t even sure what he’d been hoping for. A message from the police, perhaps? *Oi, mate, did you just drink someone’s blood?* He snorted, his lips twitching with a flicker of mirth that quickly faded.

But, all joking aside, what would he actually do if the police came knocking? Had he even done anything… well, *illegal*?

“Okay,” he muttered to himself, talking it through in the hopes it might make some sense. “Yes, stealing the water was wrong. And I suppose not reporting a death is technically a crime. But other than that, I haven’t actually done anything wrong, have I?” He paused, scratching his head. “Drinking blood? Weird, yes. But… is it illegal? I mean, no one ever *said* it was.”

He shrugged, half-convinced by his own reasoning. Yet, somewhere in the back of his mind, an errant thought surfaced, nudging its way to the front. *It was very exciting, though.*

Without realising it, Michael had flicked through the channels again and landed on Channel 5. The 2002 *Spider-Man* film was on. He took this as a sign that the universe was mercifully offering him a distraction. He’d sit tight, watch a bit of telly, and stay put until the local news came on—surely something as catastrophic as a dead shopkeeper in Cardiff auditioning for the California Raisins, would be newsworthy. He wandered into the kitchen to make a cup of tea… oh. Right. No water. The universe, again, mocked him. Typical.

He plopped back down on the settee, scratching his head as Tobey Maguire’s Peter Parker began discovering his strange new abilities. *What if…?* A reckless notion bubbled up in his mind, one he couldn’t ignore.

Moments later, he was in the bathroom, staring into the mirror. His vision was still a bit blurry, but his skin—well, now, that was something. He leaned in. Softer. Less haggard. His hair looked marginally less grey, too, and he hadn’t even forked out for one of those fancy shampoos. He took off his glasses and blinked. *Perfect vision? Nope.*

In a burst of optimism, he lifted his hand and attempted to shoot a web at the wall. Nothing happened, of course.

""Well, obviously,"" he muttered to himself. I wasn’t bitten by a spider and since when did spiderman go around drinking up random pools of blood.

But curiosity tugged at him. He inspected his hands, squinting at them as if they’d start glowing or sprouting fangs. They didn’t. But in an odd moment of inspiration—no, it was more like compulsion—he drew his arm back and punched the bathroom wall.

There was a crunch, followed by a *crack*, followed by a single brick flying out of his bathroom wall towards his settee. Followed, very quickly by him howling at the top of his lungs.

""AAaaaHHHaaHHH FUCK ME, THAT HURTS! AAAARGH! OW OW OW! FUUUUUCK!""

He shook his hand, half-expecting to see a mangled mess, but his knuckles were unscathed, even if his nerves weren’t. Pain, it seemed, was no respecter of newfound strength. 

And what strength? Michael looked at the brick in the room, increasingly amazed by the distance it had travelled. It had separated itself from the rest of the wall, mortar and plaster tumbling after it. It even still had a fist shaped bit of the bathroom wallpaper attached and that stuff was from the 70s and probably contained asbestos.

*Knock knock.*

Michael froze, eyes darting to the front door.

*Knock knock knock.*

He tiptoed over, still nursing his hand. He peered through the dirty peephole, not daring to approach the curtains in case he gave his position away. Standing there, cigarette in hand and an expression of barely contained frustration, was Jackie from next door. Oh thank god, he thought.

""Mike, are you alright?"" she shouted through the door, sounding as though she already knew the answer. ""I heard loads of swearing and shouting.""

Michael opened the door a crack and cleared his throat doing his best to offer a neighbourly smile. ""Yes, I’m OK, thanks. Just... stubbed my toe.""

""Well, do you mind keepin’ it the fuck down? I just got the baby to fuckin’ sleep.""

""Sorry."" he offered, like that was the worst thing he’d done so far today.

Satisfied she’d made her point, Jackie flashed a scrunched nose smile at him before shuffling back to her own flat next door, muttering something unkind under her breath.

Michael closed the door with a smile but his restlessness hadn’t quite gone away. He was still buzzing, still wondering, his mind racing with all the inexplicable things that had happened today. He looked at the brick on the floor of the living room and its corresponding hole in the wall. He knew he was way more proud of that than he should be.

So he decided to do what any self-respecting superhero might do next. He tried a jump—and promptly smacked his head on the ceiling. The thud echoed through the flat, and he cursed himself for making yet more noise. He glanced nervously at the door, half-expecting Jackie to appear with a fresh set of complaints.

He sighed. Right. Cup of tea and a think… oh. Right. No water. Just a think then.

He again plonked himself in front of spider-man while thinking of the wonderful things he might discover about himself later. Then he had an idea. Flat rooftops at night, he thought, rubbing his forehead. That’s when superheroes do their thing. I’m safe until then if I just stay here. The thought actually brought him a surprising amount of peace. He settled back on the sofa, his mind beginning to drift.

Just then, his old mobile phone let out a cheerful, polyphonic beep. He glanced down at the display. It read: JOB CENTRE 4PM.

1gtq4lp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gtq4lp,One Last Flight from PDK to LGA and back: A Love Letter to MSFS 2020,"This morning felt different. I woke up before the alarm, that rare kind of early where the room is still dark, and the air feels heavy with potential. It wasn’t just another flight; it was the last one. The last time I’d fire up my PC, load into Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, and take my trusty PC-12 from DeKalb-Peachtree (PDK) to LaGuardia (LGA) and back.

MSFS wasn’t just a game for me. It was the catalyst for something much bigger.

Coffee in hand, I powered up the sim, listening to the familiar hum of my rig as the world outside started to stir. Loading into the PDK tarmac, I let the details sink in one last time—the crisp lighting, the whine of the turbines spooling up, and the satisfying click of toggling switches. That plane and I had been through countless flights: Sedona to the Aleutians, a nerve-wracking STOL takeoff from Mount Fuji. But this morning, it wasn’t about drama. It was about closing a chapter.

Takeoff was smooth. Atlanta spread out beneath me like a living map, traffic crawling on 285, and Stone Mountain peeking through the haze. The climb felt effortless, the way it always does when the air is cool and the sim is running buttery smooth.

Somewhere over the Blue Ridge Mountains, it hit me. This game isn’t just a game. It taught me to respect aviation in a way I never expected. It taught me the precision of navigation, the importance of preflight checklists, and how to handle the stress of troubleshooting something midair. More than that, it gave me a glimpse of what life as a pilot could be.

LGA came up fast, the skyline shimmering in the morning light. The approach over the city was always a highlight—threading the needle of airspace, navigating vectors from virtual ATC. The touchdown was smooth, but there was a lump in my throat. The PC-12 was taking me home one last time.

Flying back to PDK, I spent most of the time reflecting. This wasn’t the end. It was the beginning. I’d been chasing this for months now: ground school, studying for the written, finding time between everything else to make it real. And it was all because of this sim.

The PC-12 floated down onto PDK’s runway like it knew this was goodbye. I parked at the same stand I always do, shut her down, and just sat there for a second, watching the propeller spin to a stop.

When I clicked “exit,” it felt like closing a book I didn’t want to finish. But the thing about good stories? They stay with you.

MSFS gave me the dream. Now it’s time to make it real.

If you’ve ever flown something in MSFS and felt the pull to do it in real life, you know what I’m talking about. It’s not just a game; it’s a stepping stone. Here’s to chasing dreams, whether in the virtual skies or the real ones.
