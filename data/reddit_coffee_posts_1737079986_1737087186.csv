**Who Is Justin Blackman, and Why Should You Care?**

Justin Blackman isn‚Äôt your typical writing coach.

Plus, it‚Äôs packed with humor and real-world examples that make the lessons stick.

I need ideas/advice for meals that I can take to work. I usually buy some sort of takeout to eat, like sushi or a budget meal at Maccas. It's not necessarily cheap or at all nutritious but it's something quick that I can run back to work with as I don't get breaks. 

Where I work I dont have access to a refrigerator , kettle or microwave, so I always feel like I'm limited as I can't keep things cool or heat them up. When I buy hot food, it usually goes cold because I work in customer service so I can't eat it until I get home anyway. Half the time I go through my shift on a coffee and water since my shifts are usually only 4.5 hrs nowadays.

Uni starts up again soon too, so if you have any budget friendly meals that don't need to stay cold or be re-heated, it'd be perfect for me. I can make ofcourse make standard sandwiches, but I'm hoping if there's any options other than just that..

But I‚Äôm a college student taking pretty hard math classes. Every now and then, specifically last night, I decided I would drink coffee (rare occasion for me) so I could stay up late and study. This morning I got up a little extra early to get more coffee to make it through the test. 

But then it hit me, never have I ever done something like that for God. Never have I ever been confused by a Bible verse and spent all night doing research on it. 

It sounds to me like I am worshipping school over God. But what else am I supposed to do? 

And more food for thought, what if I did the same thing, but was majoring in Christian studies instead of engineering. And say I stayed up all night studying Romans for a test the next day. Would that be worshipping school still or worshipping God? I guess it depends on WHY you chose to do it?

Out of conviction and thankfulness, I took a few breaks last night to listen to some worship music. 

But what do you think?

I guess the Bible does say to work as hard as I can for the Lord. But that doesn‚Äôt apply to this if that wasn‚Äôt what was in my heart last night.

I spent too introverted
In mental plagues and fast pleasures
Little did I feel the summer breeze
And yet it blew through my clothes
As did many coffees down my throat
And ticks of clock through my heartbeats
I may have kissed and forgot
Treated hugs pettily
I would love now to adore presently:
Love in effect and all within the context
Less in my mind and more of my eyes on you
Nose breathing in every cloud of coffee beans
Ears at every utterance of your mind and heart
And my fingers sensing every inch
That yours covered over mine
At every time you held my hand
I've been at war for a while now
Wailing and waving white flag
Wading through white deserts
Wasting away gradually
Craving truce to allow space for a warm heart
I've conditioned self to cope with the cold
Comforting sores with coals
And brazen conduct
To the loss of self
My descent to the present is recent
That it's just now I sensed an incense
That has always been in my atmosphere
I am after a confrontation with my fears
And tears tended to compassionately
It's as though I have to solve
Through the current state of affairs
To have more than just a fleeting feeling
It's not into love that I fell
At first sight or over a coffee table
Only just curiosity
All encounters with you
Accounting for an image of you
Though you've bridged through my threshold of attraction
Stuck at an extent
That maybe time will extend
And prove me false
That I did factually skip a pulse
When you held my hand",1,1737086486.0,justpoetry,0,1.0,False

I get that good grades ""might"" get you into a good college. But who does really care about where you go to college? 

Students with good grades aren't really rewarded much for all the work they put in. 

In my school, they put 50% of the kids in my grade into honors classes. If you manage to maintain anything above a C average then you automatically make honor roll. The reward for honor roll is a $10 Dunkin' Donut gift card and a certificate. This means that students who study for hours a day to get A's in their ap classes get a free donut and iced coffee every 2 months. Students who have barely touched a book since the 6th grade but somehow manage to get a C also get the same donut and coffee.

I find that there is no reason to get good grades besides being able to brag that you got a higher grade than your friend (but nobody likes a braggart)

I'm in too deep and not sure..,"My husband (27) and I (29) have been together for 6 years, married for 2. I knew he had a temper when dating but didn't experience it directed at me until maybe our 2nd year in. Last year, his father suddenly passed away. We were long distance (I moved back to my home state and he was in his home state waiting to transfer) and it was during an extremely stressful time as my brother was critically ill in the hospital. I ended getting laid off from my job and felt like I was at the lowest point of my life. I found out he was unfaithful. No sex or emotional relationships, but definitely crossed lines and was unfaithful. When I found out about this, it led to constant fighting as I was in complete and utter shock. I would call him and cry and question how he could've done this which caused him to explode. He started breaking furniture at the place he was staying at, ultimately was asked to leave. Shortly after, I flew in for his father's funeral and found a text on his phone from a random number but with a name similar or identical to the cheating incident. I questioned him about that, he flew into a rage, grabbed my bag, phone, keys, airpods and threw them out of his place and told me to get the fuck out. I- again- was in complete shock, crying, confused in the middle of the night. I didn't want to leave him alone at his father's funeral and didn't want to involve anyone so I answered his calls, went back and followed through like nothing happened. I gave him an ultimatum to get help/take time off from work or divorce. He was enraged but followed through with taking him to work on his mental health. He moved in with me. Constant fights, yelling, some destruction of property. He's punched the wall, the closet door and destroyed a coffee table. Hitting himself. Slapping himself. Grabbed my keys out of my hand to get me out of his car. He's blocked me sometimes when we've argued and wanted to leave to take a minute or a break. One time we were out of town and got into a nasty fight in the car. I tried to exit the car to take a break, he grabbed my backpack pretty much forcing me back into the car. Fought with me over my backpack with my phone and wallet. Drove erratically on the freeway as I screamed and yelled and panicked. He's yelled and repeated his statement at me 20-30-40-50 times when I've disengaged and tried to breathe. He's threatened divorce, saying to get rid of my married last name, or give him his ring back when I try to separate from the situation and not continue the fight/reconcile immediately. He's exploded at his mother and sister which barely have contact with him. He's exploded at my family and my family has just recently started to speak to him. I convinced him to go to an inpatient mental health facility. He's recommended to be there for 2 months for anxiety, depression, ADHD and adjustment disorder. I've been visiting him but recently have felt so much anger and pain towards him. He's always apologetic, always sincere. Always says he will fight for me and do anything he can. Tries to do better. We've gone to couples counseling and individual counseling. He's tried so much as is a completely different person when calm. He's sweet, loving, attentive, caring. He's my best friend.

I (F23) recently went on a first date with a guy (M25) I met on Bumble. We had been chatting for about a month before meeting, and I already felt like we had a good vibe. When we finally went on our first date, it ended up lasting six hours!

We started with coffee, and before we knew it, we moved on to dinner because neither of us wanted the date to end. The conversation was so natural, and it felt like we just clicked. At the end of the night, something unexpected but sweet happened‚Äîhe looked at me, smiled, and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna kiss you now.‚Äù It caught me off guard in the best way, and I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing, but then we kissed. It was intimate and lasted for nearly 20 minutes.

Afterward, he asked me for a second date, and now I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how great the whole experience was. I got the impression that he really liked me, especially since he didn‚Äôt want the date to end, but I‚Äôm not sure how to interpret his intentions long-term.

Are you dreaming of a brighter, more confident smile?

Understanding Hydrogen Peroxide Teeth Whitening

Hydrogen peroxide is a powerful bleaching agent that has revolutionized teeth whitening treatments. When applied to teeth, it breaks down into water and oxygen molecules, which effectively remove surface and deep-set stains. Unlike many over-the-counter whitening products, hydrogen peroxide can penetrate tooth enamel, providing more significant and long-lasting results.

Key Benefits of Hydrogen Peroxide Teeth Whitening
- Rapid stain removal
- Cost-effective solution
- Accessible treatment options
- Noticeable results in short time
- Versatile application methods

1. Professional cleaning
2. Protective gum barriers
3. Concentrated hydrogen peroxide application
4. Specialized light or laser activation

At-Home Whitening Options

I‚Äôm always reading comments from other moms talking about how they can‚Äôt stand to be away from their kids, they can‚Äôt go enjoy a break because all they can think about is the baby, etc. 

I have no issues taking time away from my kids. My toddler regularly stays at a grandparent‚Äôs house because we trust them and she has fun. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd say that I don‚Äôt miss her, because I do. But I have zero reservations about taking advantage of the opportunity when it‚Äôs offered and enjoying the time we get to ourselves.

We recently had our second baby just a little under a month ago. I left him at my house with my mom for the first time at maybe a week old? Just to run to the store and get myself a coffee. And it felt great. I felt like I could breathe. She kept him and my toddler the other day so I could go to a nail appointment. I didn‚Äôt think twice about leaving them with her- they were safe and I wanted a break.

But I guess I just feel guilty for that. For wanting time away. For not worrying more or thinking of them as much when they‚Äôre not around. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt have a bond with them, because I do. I love my kids more than anything, but sometimes I feel like my love is inferior to the love that other mothers have for their children.

Just having a very anxious episode right now and wanted to vent what‚Äôs in my mind to see if it helps.)

The fear has me again. 

I was doing so well for so long, but these days the highs are followed by what feels like dramatic lows, and they creep up on me in the depth of night. And I‚Äôm forced to lay there with them, trying to stop my mind running away with those thoughts before I implode into a full blown panic. 

I don‚Äôt want to talk about these things because it‚Äôs easier to just vent it out for a bit of respite and be fine for a little while. It‚Äôs hard to trust people with this. I know some of you understand.  The only option is to lie here and just let it happen. Let the anxious tsunami wash over me in the hopes I‚Äôll last as long from tomorrow until the next time. 

Why does it always start like this? Why does it always come out of nowhere - one bad thought; even just a passing one. It‚Äôs enough to take my state of mind from the relative beaten path to the edge of the cliff, ready to swan dive into a frenzy of impending doom and the false truth of everything, coming to an end, crashing down around me. 

But seriously why? Why is it either barely satisfactory or just feeling like everything is fucked, I‚Äôve fucked everything, it was all my fault and I should‚Äôve seen it coming? Everything is going to wrong because I didn‚Äôt do x, didn‚Äôt anticipate y, didn‚Äôt notice or consider z. 

I‚Äôm so exhausted of having to anticipate everything and having a plan B for everything from the moment I wake up to the moment I sleep. It‚Äôs only when I sleep that I feel at ease because I know whatever happens to me in a dream, will be barely recalled when I woke up, and a complete memory by the time I‚Äôve taken my first sip of coffee. But then, woken up to what? The same thoughts and feelings but the consequences, no matter how ridiculously farfetched, are real? 

Why is my mind like this? Even typing this and reading this back I feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind. Or have I already lost it, and this is what‚Äôs become. I‚Äôm just tired of this. I‚Äôm exhausted in my soul. Nothing seems to help, only keeps it at bay. I feel like I‚Äôll never be free of this. Trapped. And no one is coming to save me from it. No one can save me. Completely and utterly lost to the mercy of my own thoughts, that will run immediately to whatever the very worst case scenario is and present that as an absolute, unequivocal and total fact. 

The thought of anything joyful are lost in a sea of thought patterns intertwined with fear and anxiety that I wouldn‚Äôt even notice them if I was thinking them. I‚Äôd worry if I wasn‚Äôt anxious about something.

I just want it to tell me what it wants to stop this. I wish it would just name a price or the quid pro quo to put an end to this. Put an end to it for the last time. Each time I slip back into this it feels worse, like I‚Äôm being attacked for having a better period and not giving it attention. And it takes so much effort and guile to get to a place of something even remotely resembling a sense of normality. Being so careful not to do the wrong thing, say the wrong words, walking on eggshells around everything takes so much  energy and effort that the next time I‚Äôm not sure I can go through it again - even if I want to.

I‚Äôve always brushed off haunted house stories and Ouija board warnings as nonsense. But now, sitting alone in this cold, dark apartment, with the shadows pooling in the corners of the room, I wish I had taken it all more seriously.

It started a few nights ago at a party. It was one of those cheap beer, loud music, and too-many-people-in-one-space kinds of nights. My buddy Mike had thrown it together in his parents‚Äô old house while they were out of town. The place was ancient, all creaking floorboards and peeling wallpaper. Someone mentioned the attic, and before long, Mike came stumbling down the stairs holding an old Ouija board.

‚ÄúYou scared, Jake?‚Äù he said, shoving it toward me. The board looked like it had seen better days. The letters were faded, and the wood smelled faintly of mildew. A small, triangular planchette sat neatly on top, polished from years of use.

‚ÄúScared? Of this thing?‚Äù I scoffed, but I could feel the heat of everyone‚Äôs eyes on me. A couple of girls were giggling nervously, and the guys were all smirking, waiting to see if I‚Äôd take the bait.

I wasn‚Äôt about to back down. ‚ÄúFine,‚Äù I said, snatching the board from him and dropping it on the coffee table. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see what all the fuss is about.‚Äù

Mike and a few others sat down with me, while the rest of the partygoers circled around, whispering and recording us on their phones. I wasn‚Äôt nervous‚Äîat least, that‚Äôs what I told myself. It‚Äôs just a stupid game.

We placed our fingers on the planchette, and I cleared my throat. ‚ÄúAlright, spirits,‚Äù I said, trying to sound casual, ‚Äúif you‚Äôre here, give us a sign.‚Äù

For a moment, nothing happened. A few people chuckled, and someone muttered, ‚ÄúTold you it‚Äôs fake.‚Äù I was about to call it quits when the planchette moved.

Not a small twitch. It moved.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs messing with it?‚Äù I asked, narrowing my eyes at Mike. He raised his hands in mock surrender.

‚ÄúNot me,‚Äù he said, and everyone else chimed in, insisting they weren‚Äôt moving it either.

The planchette slid slowly, deliberately, to ‚ÄúH.‚Äù Then to ‚ÄúE.‚Äù Then ‚ÄúL.‚Äù

‚ÄúHell,‚Äù someone whispered. A nervous laugh broke the silence, but it didn‚Äôt last long.

‚ÄúAlright, funny,‚Äù I said, my voice faltering slightly. ‚ÄúYou got your scare. Let‚Äôs stop now.‚Äù

But the planchette didn‚Äôt stop. It kept moving. ‚ÄúH-E-L-P.‚Äù

The air in the room seemed heavier, thicker. The laughter and murmurs died away, replaced by an eerie, oppressive silence.

‚ÄúHelp who?‚Äù I asked, my voice quieter than I intended.

The planchette froze in the center of the board. Before anyone could say anything, the lights in the house flickered, then went out completely.

Someone screamed. I felt a rush of cold air sweep past me, and in the pitch black, I swear I saw something. A shape, darker than the shadows, moving across the room.

I fumbled for my phone, turning on the flashlight. The pale beam cut through the darkness, but it didn‚Äôt feel like enough. The room felt too big, the shadows too alive.

‚ÄúTurn the lights back on!‚Äù someone yelled, their voice panicked.

I tried to speak, to calm everyone down, but before I could, I felt it‚Äîa cold, featherlight touch on my arm. My breath caught in my throat.

And then, I heard it. A voice, low and raspy, whispering directly behind me.

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have asked.‚Äù

I turned sharply, the flashlight trembling in my hand, but there was nothing there. Just darkness.

They both had adults that didn't want to fill their kids in on their past, too much relationship drama that oftentimes felt unnecessary (especially with the way Lucas reacted towards Margot and just straight up left Seattle to go back to fort Lawrence. I understand he didn't like Seattle but the fact that they never had a sit down talk about what they both wanted was dumb), both seasons had adults that were possessed by something and no one even knew, stuff that's plot holey and doesn't make sense, lots of bone breakage, horrible dialogue, the list goes on and on. I don't understand why they are basically copy and pasting instead of making each season unique (especially since this is an anthology series instead of it being like a continuous plot). 


I'm by no means a huge goosebumps fan (hell I hate goosebumps), but I loved r.l stines the haunting hour and when I saw this reboot was geared more towards adults I was super intrigued. This was just super underwhelming and I'm extremely disappointed that the music choices for the first season were so good but then the second season flopped hard with the music. I'm also *extremely* annoyed that Nora and collins still got with each other in the end as I don't like when people have affairs with one another. 


If I had to tell someone which season I liked better it would be the second just because it really pulled me in at first. But when it started having weird plot holes like how Trey should've turned into an alien yet survived in the coffee shop with an alien, Devin was told by the aliens they wanted to make everyone like them (yet that didn't happen, like we didn't get an apocalyptic ending), everyone just knows how to read slappy's card with the weird language (you'd think if you don't speak it precisely that it wouldn't work), Nora's 'powers' weren't really looked into more, etc it really just makes me feel like I wasted a lot of my time. 

I dunno, I want to hold out hope that it'll get better but if I didn't like these two seasons how is the third one gonna be any different üò≠.

I‚Äôd say overall big picture it‚Äôs great- my binge eating is diminished, my overall temperament is better, anxiety is improved. My sleep was pretty solid also when I started it. I was sick over Xmas and didn‚Äôt take it for about 2 weeks since I was taking Sudafed, my practitioner recommended that I not take both.

","Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are essential tools for businesses and individuals looking to secure their internet connections, protect sensitive data, and ensure privacy. However, not all VPNs are the same. There are different types of VPNs designed to meet specific needs, with two of the most common being Remote Access VPNs and Site-to-Site VPNs. Each of these VPNs serves a distinct purpose and operates differently, depending on the use case. In this post, we‚Äôll explore the key differences between Remote Access VPNs and Site-to-Site VPNs, and explain which is best suited for specific scenarios.

1. What is a Remote Access VPN?

A Remote Access VPN (also known as a client-to-site VPN) allows individual users to securely connect to a private network, typically from a remote location, such as their home or while traveling. It creates a secure, encrypted tunnel between the user‚Äôs device and the organization‚Äôs network, ensuring that the data exchanged between them is private and protected from unauthorized access.

How it Works:

The remote user installs VPN software on their device (laptop, smartphone, or tablet) and connects to the organization's VPN server.

The VPN server authenticates the user, and the connection is encrypted, protecting the data.

Once the connection is established, the user can access the company‚Äôs internal network, files, and applications, just as if they were in the office.

Use Cases:

Remote workers: Employees who need to access the company network from a different location, such as at home or while traveling.

Telecommuting: Workers who do not have a fixed office location but need to access internal resources securely.

Bypassing Geo-restrictions: Individuals accessing regionally blocked content securely, for personal use.

Why It Matters:

A Remote Access VPN is ideal for companies that have employees working remotely, as it enables them to securely access resources and data without compromising privacy or security.

2. What is a Site-to-Site VPN?

A Site-to-Site VPN (also known as a router-to-router VPN) is used to connect two or more physical locations or networks securely. This type of VPN allows entire office branches or departments to securely communicate with each other across the internet or a wide area network (WAN), creating a private connection between different geographical locations.

How it Works:

Each office or location has a VPN gateway, such as a router or firewall, that handles the connection.

The VPN gateways establish an encrypted tunnel between the networks, allowing devices at each location to communicate securely.

Unlike a Remote Access VPN, Site-to-Site VPNs do not require user-specific software, as the connection is established between network devices, not individual users.

Use Cases:

Connecting multiple office locations: A company with offices in different cities or countries can connect their local networks securely over the internet.

Secure communication between branch offices: Site-to-Site VPNs allow branches of the same company to share resources and communicate securely across the internet.

Connecting data centers: Enterprises may use Site-to-Site VPNs to connect private data centers or cloud resources with on-premise networks.

Why It Matters:

Site-to-Site VPNs are suitable for organizations that need to securely link large networks across different locations or connect on-premise systems to cloud services without the need for individual user involvement.

3. Key Differences Between Remote Access VPNs and Site-to-Site VPNs

3.1. Purpose and Scope

Remote Access VPN: Primarily used for allowing individual users to connect to a network remotely.

Site-to-Site VPN: Used to link entire networks or office locations securely over the internet.

3.2. Connection Type

Remote Access VPN: Establishes a connection between a user‚Äôs device (laptop, smartphone, etc.) and the company network, typically via VPN software.

Site-to-Site VPN: Creates a secure connection between two or more network devices (e.g., routers, firewalls) at different locations.

3.3. User Authentication

Remote Access VPN: Requires user authentication (typically via username/password, and sometimes multi-factor authentication) to establish a connection.

Site-to-Site VPN: Does not require individual user authentication, as the VPN connection is established between network devices, usually using pre-shared keys or certificates.

3.4. Scalability

Remote Access VPN: Scales well for businesses with a flexible number of remote employees who need access to company resources.

Site-to-Site VPN: Best for connecting multiple office locations or branch networks, and may require more complex infrastructure as the network grows.

3.5. Configuration Complexity

Remote Access VPN: Easier to set up for individual users or smaller teams, with straightforward software installations.

Site-to-Site VPN: Typically requires more complex configuration, as it involves connecting entire networks, often requiring specialized hardware and networking knowledge.

4. Benefits of Remote Access VPNs

4.1. Secure Remote Work

Remote Access VPNs enable employees to securely access corporate resources from anywhere with an internet connection. This flexibility is essential for remote work, especially as businesses embrace hybrid or fully remote models.

4.2. Encryption and Privacy

VPNs encrypt data traffic, ensuring that sensitive information remains private and protected from hackers or third parties, even when using unsecured networks like public Wi-Fi.

4.3. Easy to Deploy for Small Teams

Remote Access VPNs are ideal for smaller teams or organizations that need a straightforward solution for securing remote access. No complex hardware or network configurations are necessary, just a simple software application on the user‚Äôs device.

5. Benefits of Site-to-Site VPNs

5.1. Secure Communication Between Office Locations

Site-to-Site VPNs provide a secure and efficient way for large organizations to connect multiple office locations, ensuring that communication between branches remains private and secure.

5.2. Consistent Network Connectivity

Because the connection is established between networks, Site-to-Site VPNs provide a constant and stable network connection without needing individual user intervention, ideal for data-heavy applications and internal systems.

5.3. Centralized Management

Site-to-Site VPNs simplify network management by enabling administrators to configure the VPN connection on the network devices (routers, firewalls) rather than managing individual user devices.

6. When to Use Remote Access VPN vs. Site-to-Site VPN

Use Remote Access VPN when:

You need to provide secure access for individual users, such as remote employees or freelancers.

Users need to connect from different locations or on-the-go (e.g., working from home, traveling, or accessing resources from coffee shops or airports).

Your organization has a small to medium number of remote users.

Use Site-to-Site VPN when:

You need to link multiple office locations securely over the internet.

Entire networks (rather than individual users) need to connect, such as branch offices or connecting a cloud-based system with a corporate data center.

You are managing large-scale operations with a fixed number of office locations that need secure and constant communication.

7. Conclusion

VPNs are essential tools for securing internet traffic and protecting sensitive data. Understanding the difference between Remote Access VPNs and Site-to-Site VPNs is key to selecting the right solution for your organization‚Äôs needs.

Remote Access VPNs are ideal for securing remote access for individual users, enabling employees to work securely from anywhere.

Site-to-Site VPNs are better suited for connecting entire networks across multiple locations, providing secure communication for larger organizations with multiple offices.

By understanding your business requirements, number of users, and network infrastructure, you can make an informed decision about which VPN type best suits your needs.

1i3772s,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeerotation/comments/1i3772s/what_is_rotation_coffee_why_did_i_start_this/,What is ROTATION COFFEE? Why did I start this subreddit.,"I started this subreddit because I‚Äôm an enthusiast who‚Äôs always on the move, trying new beans and roasters whenever I can.   
  
My goal is simple: I want to taste 1,000+ coffees a year and figure out what‚Äôs really worth talking about. But along the way, I‚Äôve run into a common problem. You spend money on beans, sometimes they‚Äôre not what you hoped for, and now you‚Äôre stuck with bags you won‚Äôt finish. International shipping costs and blind recommendations don‚Äôt make it easier either because of the lag and again the full commitment to make a big purchase.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm trying to build something different here. A few people reached out when they saw I had extra beans, asking for just enough to brew a cup and try it themselves. That gave me an idea: why not create a space where I can actively share my beans, and explore together?

Looking ahead, I‚Äôd love for this to grow into something bigger. Imagine hosting a summit with 40-50 people coming together to actively taste, rate, and blind-rank coffees to create a ‚ÄúTop of the World‚Äù list based on real people‚Äôs experiences. You don‚Äôt need certifications, degrees, or industry clout. You just need to know your stuff and be legit.

I come from a completely different industry, so I get why some people might question my seemingly ‚Äúsilly‚Äù takes on things or how coffee is currently done (why prices are high, who gets paid what, fair wage this or that). There‚Äôs a lot of noise from these people, but they bring little to no real credentials to the table. I used to be a high level C suite executive and business operator, so when I get heat for asking or challenging certain current coffee paradigms, it doesn‚Äôt bother me. That‚Äôs just how I‚Äôve always approached things questioning, analyzing, and pushing for clarity is part of what I do.  
  
Unfortunately, a lot of redditors tend to criticize first without taking the time to understand the person behind the post, which is why I catch a lot of heat.

Honestly, I love it. It‚Äôs funny to me. At the end of the day, I know that what I‚Äôm doing, sharing, teaching, and learning will ultimately have a much greater impact on the coffee industry as a whole.

For now, let‚Äôs start small. What are your recommendations? What should we try next? What‚Äôs on your ‚Äúmust try‚Äù list? Maybe we can brain resources, order, and get this off the ground & eventually turn this into something bigger.

Have barely seen my boyfriend in 3 days and he storms out after getting home,"As the title says, I've barely seen my boyfriend for three days now. I'm 29F and he's 34M and we've been together about 2 years, living together for 1 of those.

The first day he worked morning and I worked night like we do two days a week. Our shifts overlap so we only saw each other early morning and late at night. Also for context, we both work at the same restaurant but I'm BOH and he's FOH, and we barely see each other there.

The second day he was out of the house before I was awake. He usually goes for coffee before I'm awake, but yesterday he got coffee, went by his mom's, went to the gym, then came home with five minutes to spare to take me to work. I always work late and he sleeps early, so again we barely saw each other. I told him last night I wanted to snuggle because I'd barely seen him, but he was grumpy and wouldn't let me even lay an arm over him.

Today was basically the same. Before I woke up he was off. Basically the same thing. Coffee, then the grocery store. Then to his mom's; I guess he was going to take the laundry instead of paying at the laundry room at our place, but didn't do laundry and just visited. Then on to the gym, where he stayed until he had barely enough time to come home and get ready. I didn't work tonight, so I was home alone doing the laundry he didn't do.

I pick him up and he's telling me how one of the servers blew up and stormed out. He was inclined to take the server's side, but I was telling him how something had gone down last night between the GM and that server, and how the server had fucked over the kitchen many times, and he starts staying, ""Okay, okay. I'm done talking about it. Whatever. I don't care about it anymore."" Clearly trying to shut me down before I even had a chance to finish telling him about it.

I told him he was being a dick. If he didn't want to talk about work, whatever, but he didn't have to be so dismissive when I gave my opinion.

He gets really annoyed and says I was getting ""angry"" (I wasn't, at all), and I was ""making him anxious"". I said I wasn't angry, and I just wanted him to not be so rude. I again state he was being a dick.

Now he's pissed off and says I'm looking for arguments, grabs the keys, and storms out.

He was home for less than 10 minutes, and here I am again, spending another day alone.

Was I wrong to call him a dick? He has a history of shutting me down in the middle of me talking. His eyes get really flat like he's annoyed or he just leaves the room without saying anything.

I've been progressively going upwards in life more recently. More grounded with myself, my higher power, my guides. Having positive experiences and happenings.

I started actively meditating Invisioning a positive future for myself world time line.

I got into a very positive head space this was Saturday and imagined my energy directed upwards and forwards into a beautiful light a positive timeline where I'm content happy successful abundant free.

I imagined synching up with other light workers focusing on my heart chakra to subliminally elict the energy waves of positivity world wide. 

I ocassionally do this, when I feel I have an excess of positive energy. I'm not sure if it affects anything. I just felt so loving free, happy content and had the desire to share it or for more people to feel that way.

I believe we are all one so I imagine connecting to humanity on a positive note giving little energy burst for inspiration motivation to keep going and be happy like a prayer for the world if you will.

I hate doom speak and I believe if we all believe we are done than that is the reality we will manifest due to our actions. I believe in manifesting positivity with energy and then physically acting upon those actions in the physical world to bring them into fruition. I've made my life a lot better and more positive as well as attracted more positive people into my life this way. Am more content in my reality and hopeful for the future whether I have an impact or not. Maybe if I can inspire one person I've made a more postive change on the frequency of earth 

Afterwards. I have a good night and go out Sunday I meet a cool guy and we talk about how the world is actually better than it's been in a lot of ways, but  news puts a lot of negativity out. And that he believes humans are inherently good most are good. I enjoyed this conversation because I rarely meet people that share the same sentiment.

As the night goes on I end up getting a bad concussion. This is Sunday.

I am unable to breathe Monday and my life starts getting more negative 

I have several awful dreams some which elements came true. One with rotting oranges and squash. In my dream I was numb but actively trying to replace the fruits with fresh ones. My mom was in my dream as well. And sent me oranges the next day.

The day after I go to the hospital twice because I'm having trouble thinking speaking I feel like my personality just got trapped in the back of my subconscious.

I still feel like this I've really had a hard time expressing myself verbally which is very abnormal for me because that's one of my strengths. Drawing and being creative it was very scary because even if I'm unhappy I still have my core personality and it felt like that was stripped away from me 

I'm still recovering but I feel like after me sending out all that positive energy I got whiplashed with a huge amount of negative energy. I've noticed this happen before when postively meditating on a good timeline for the world. I do not notice this when just manifesting positivity directly for myself.

As in I'll immediately get sick or something if the like.

Around Tuesday a lot of random people from my past I kept running into at a very high rate. Like 20 + people I knew in one day some that I haven't seen in a while it was strange. 

Some odd conicednces.

Also this guy I had just served the other night randomly ran into him at a coffee shop so it was people that weren't even close to me just familiar faces.

I visibly felt this angry heat in the back of my head and dreamed of a black liquidy being with wings trying to grab on to me. Also I felt and old man leave my body I don't know how to describe it. 

It felt like he had been inside me my whole life I only now realized he was there. I actively rebuked it from my body and felt much lighter and peaceful. This resulted in me having to go back to the ER because I couldn't breathe as if it was attaching me to earth or maybe just a bad concussion.

I felt in a heightened enlightened state after the concussion extremely loving until my body kicked in out of fear. 

Then even today I started a new job, this guy I had slept with  the height of my first Kundalini awakening that I feel a soul tie I'm trying to remove's current girlfriend came in and sat staring at me while I was trying to learn table numbers.

I don't know her have never seen her before until recently keep running into her, I hold no illl will. The guy isn't bad but still in a very different more material superficial state that I am now. He taught me to love myself more and that I didn't like superficiality. I'm not judging them I just feel heavy around him. And some of the old people I've run into.

As I feel the people in my current life are much more healed and the older people are much more unhealed or at the state I used to be.

I felt frustrated and pulled backwards and scared at my current concussed state.

I don't know if I should send positive energy out like that anymore 

Or talk about my experiences/ w the supernatural I notice when I do I suffer from bad luck or have this shut down feeling as it's hard for me to speak on a particular subject but rn now it feels in general which is terrifying.

My higher self or guides also keep communicating for me to leave the US and stay quiet and inscopicous about my life and self. Very protective of my goals good things in my life and my energy. They tell me to be very discerning of what I share and only share with trusted individuals. And to focus on saving money getting passport/ID and to learn how to defend myself survive in the wild. I'm also getting urges to right things down on paper.

This is hard for me because I naturally love to share ideas thoughts connect and tend to see the best in people and love to be out and am extroverted.

I also lately have been feeling as if I'm stuck between two timelines one very utopian and one very dystopian. It feels as if this timeline is a limbo collapsed one to me.

Hi, I live in NYC and I noticed that there's a lack of in-person support groups in Manhattan or in NYC as a whole for depression. As an attempt to help myself and others, I've started the Manhattan Depression Support Group. This group will host no-cost, non-facilitated, casual spaces to share, listen, or simply be in the presence of others who understand what it's like to experience depression. Our first meet-up is on Saturday, please RSVP on Meetup to attend.

Is our baby going to be ok?","I baked weed cookies last night, at the same time I baked regular cookies. They were separated, each cookie in a separate baking cup and all weed cookies on the left side, normal on the right not touching. I put around 0.5 grams in the weed butter and split it between 6 cookies, which I estimated made each 10-20mg.

I know my first mistake was baking them together.. I offered my wife a cookie and made sure to take one from the right side. I ate one from the left. Somehow the sides were switched, I don't know how. I fucked up clearly. Once they cooled more it was clear the right side cookies had more butter in them, left side looked drier and darker brown.

My wife started to feel the effects after 2 hours and it lasted all night. She felt very dizzy. She has been incredibly good during her pregnancy, no alcohol, coffee, sushi etc. She rarely drinks anyway and has only tried weed a few times in the past. I think the cookie affected her more than it would a regular user as she has zero tolerance.

She feels better this morning only a little bit dizzy. I feel awful, I'm such a fucking idiot, I can't forgive myself. I don't want to hurt our baby. I already love her so much. My wife is 23 weeks pregnant. I read that THC can reach the baby but it will be reduced to around 10% so 1-2mg. I also read that it could cause problems such as stunted growth and neurocognitive disorders.

1i36ek3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i36ek3,Almost 6 Months Carnivore - Advice on s*x drive! 34M.,"Hey carnivores! I'm currently almost at the 6 month mark of the carnivore way of eating. 34 year old male. I love this lifestyle and i've recently gotten to a point where, as a man, i've felt the strong desire to work on my physique and strength. It had been something like 8 years since I stepped foot in a gym, but I made that decision to join as part of my new year resolution. I've been about 10 times since the 01/01/25 and i'm loving every session, and already feeling myself getting stronger, showing some increased muscle size and definition, and carrying myself better and better every day since. But, the gym and working out is not my problem...

Since i've started going and pushing myself at the gym, i've noticed that almost simultaneously with that my libido has seemingly vanished üò¨ I'm just not keen at all it seems. Like I can still get hard if I really really want to, but it's almost like I just don't want to. It's strange because previously I was keen and thinking about s*x and p*rn and everything all the time ü§£ especially since going carnivore my s*x drive basically went parabolic! It was amazing! But now, it seems like I don't give a crap about that in the slightest! I've increased my eating (previously was OMAD every day) to two solid carnivore meals almost every day (particularly the days after I go to the gym), and i'm having Redmonds Re-lyte (natural) electrolytes once or twice a week. But still, basically nothing ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Is it because i'm putting too much into the gym? Is it because my body would be too exhausted (though I feel fitter, stronger and more motivated)? Is it that i'm too obsessed with myself right now, or like i'm too ""inward"" to think about lust/s*x? Do I need to simply eat more or get more fluids??

Has anyone else experienced anything like this???

** I've added some photos of myself from last night at the gym, as well as what i've eaten in the past 24 hours (plus i've had 2 or 3 coffees with around 1tbsp of pure cream in each) **",9,1737081605.0,carnivorediet,23,0.8,False

I can bitch, but also I know for my fellow Houstonians who are unhoused or don‚Äôt have access to warmth/shelter it can not only suck but be deadly. 

Genuinely, I have a bunch of coats and blankets I would like to donate. I have a tent also sitting around. I‚Äôve  driven around in nasty winter conditions in the past with those big boxes of coffee from Starbucks to give to people. These are things I‚Äôm thinking about doing this weekend!

I would love your thoughts: is it worthwhile to offer to hand these out to people or is there an organization who is taking donations? Is there something else that people would appreciate?  Basically, what‚Äôs the best use of my time/effort if I want to try to do something to help? 

Yes- I know there are shelters! I also know they fill up and might  have strings attached and just might not be feasible for every person in their situation. I also know I‚Äôm not going to solve huge systemic problems with this! I also remember being in the Army 20 odd years ago and how miserable I was when we would be in the field for weeks at a time in subzero temps.  

Tl;dr what is the best way to help people over the weekend who might have to go through the next few days of bad weather without a warm place to stay?

1i36bce,https://www.reddit.com/r/flashfiction/comments/1i36bce/mr_squeezy_man_and_ms_somia/,Mr. Squeezy Man and Ms. Somia,"Everyone has their demons. Mine have names.

There is Mr. Squeezy Man. He normally works the day shift but has been known to work overtime. He lives right behind my nose. Whenever I try to wake up from behind my eyes, he takes his big, strong, gray, pustulated hands, places his fingers on my top eyelid, and his thumb on my bottom eyelid, and tries to force my eyes closed.

Mr. Squeezy Man is one of the few that I have never seen face to face. All I see of him are his hands, with their chipped and rotted fingernails, which only happens when his hands lose their grip and slide off my eyelids. The only way to free myself of Mr. Squeezy Man‚Äôs vicelike grip is with coffee. He has gotten stronger over the years. In high school, one cup was enough‚Äîand that was with cream and sugar‚Äîbut now I need no less than three cups of the strongest, blackest coffee available.

Then there is Ms. Somia. She works the night shift. She lives inside my pillow. Her body is roughly the size of a cat, but she has arms long enough to reach the other side of my queen-size bed. Her skin is purple and wrinkled, like a grape that isn‚Äôt quite a raisin.

Whenever I am about to fall asleep, she likes to play a trick on me. Sometimes, she cups one hand around my ear, making a megaphone, and uses the other to bang on the radiator. Other times, she gives me an anti-massage, which is very much like a regular massage, except that the longer it continues, the stiffer and tenser I become.

But she has been known to play other tricks on me, such as tugging the blanket away from my feet so I get too cold, or using her long arms to bang on the ceiling, imitating the sound of the neighbors walking above. (I haven‚Äôt had upstairs neighbors in years.)

There are a couple of ways to free myself from the effects of her little tricks. I can work out before bed, but that is only when Mr. Potato is off shift. Or I can take melatonin. Like Mr. Squeezy Man, she has also gotten stronger. I used to go through a bottle every two months in high school, and now I am lucky if the bottle of melatonin lasts me a week.

1i369xe,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1i369xe/i_just_got_divorced_by_my_fake_husband_and_i/,I just got divorced by my fake ‚Äòhusband.‚Äô And I didn‚Äôt expect to be so weirdly torn up about it.,"Y‚Äôall please help I‚Äôm a genuine MESS. 

and i know the title‚Äôs got people like ‚Äò???‚Äô for sure. so let me try and explain it quickly to make it less confusing.

i‚Äôm 22F in college. I am a lesbian. My best friend is also 22M and is my roommate. He is gay. Last year for April Fools we decided to get fake married because everyone thought we were dating. We got rings and everything. Invited people to the coffee shop on campus and stuff. 


Today after nearly a year of this fake marriage, he interrupted me while I was doing homework and gave me fake divorce papers. I thought it was a joke and I was confused, and then he (poorly) tried to explain himself. That he‚Äôs been trying to pull away from me, from *us* for the past semester or so and me being the autistic girl i am was totally oblivious. he said he felt his boundaries were being crossed (because i‚Äôm a very touchy person and sometimes do so to express what i can‚Äôt verbally), and that lately he‚Äôs felt that i‚Äôve been using our fake marriage as a way to trap him into hanging out with me. 

obviously this is only his side of the story but since it was so out of nowhere to me I was kind of??? Freaked out??? In shock? Idk??? And I know what you‚Äôre probably thinking. ‚ÄòGirl you‚Äôre both gay it‚Äôs a fake marriage move on.‚Äô And I don‚Äôt want to pull the ‚Äòit was real to me!!!!‚Äô shit but like‚Ä¶ kind of. You know those characters in media (cough cough sasuke and naruto) who have such a will they won‚Äôt they relationship that no one really knows what they are to each other, not even them? That‚Äôs how it felt. And he has been there through my worst moments. We‚Äôve said we loved each other in the midst of many nights last year of me crying my eyes out because of the shit in my life constantly blowing up in my face. And I felt like constantly reminding him (and myself) of my undying devotion to him was a way to pay him back for that. 

I know it‚Äôs been toxic for awhile. Like genuinely. Never did I think I would get into a weird codependent something with my gay best friend where he is scared i‚Äôm gonna cease to exist without him and i‚Äôm scared that he‚Äôs gonna leave me. Like GIRL HE ISNT EVEN YOUR BOYFRIEND!!!!

And I know by now you‚Äôre probably like ‚Äòyeah girl this sounds like you had some unrequited love thing for him and he finally shut you down.‚Äô but i genuinely didn‚Äôt love him romantically. it was weird because he was my first real friend in college and i think since i never had friends growing up i just based it on what i know from media and formed this deep bond.

so many people told me i need to get space from him. because it was so bad last semester that i wouldn‚Äôt eat at the dining hall without him. i grew distant from all my friends that weren‚Äôt mutual friends of him. hell, i PUT MY LIFE on hold for him (literally- as in I switched my major just to be with him and then realized i had geology and luckily switched back). I almost transferred but didn‚Äôt because I‚Äôd be so sad without him even though now I kind of think it would‚Äôve been better for the both of us.

Anyways, yeah. He felt suffocated and felt like he was making it seem too much like a joke so he had to actually set the record straight tonight. I mostly just stared at him like a dead fish because he‚Äôs so conflicted avoidant that I never realized anything was an issue until he throws it in my face (which we also talked about as being something he needs to work on so people are less confused), but it still hurt. Like I‚Äòve been blasting ribs by lorde for the past hour LOL.

And I know it‚Äôs a blessing in disguise. My mom used to always say to never give up my life for a man (even a gay one), and she wanted to literally slam her head into a wall when she saw how ridiculously codependent I was to him. And I worked hard to break it over summer and winter break but it‚Äôs hard. But lately I‚Äôve been wanting my post grad self to look a lot different. While I used to beg him to confirm that we‚Äôd be getting an apartment together and be together forever, now I kind of want to be alone. Not because I hate him but because I‚Äôve been living to prevent other people from leaving for years and now I think it‚Äôs time I need to live for myself, even though that‚Äôs fucking scary as hell. And I know I shouldn‚Äôt jump to conclusions and think this means he hates me and doesn‚Äôt want to be around me cause he said he‚Äôs not mad but my brain is wired that way so i‚Äôm trying to just tell myself this is just boundaries for the both of us so we don‚Äôt inadvertently blow each other up and instead can watch each other thrive from a healthy distance as two healthy best friends.

So, yeah. I dunno. I needed to get this out somewhere cause I didn‚Äôt have anyone to talk to about it and it‚Äôs weird. Bittersweet sort of.

EDIT: hey y‚Äôall!! Please read some of my comments that I‚Äôve added onto this. I was definitely caught off guard so this post was real emotional and in my head but I‚Äôm trying to see it from a more objective lens now.

Also, we‚Äôve been friends for 4 years now. So something like this isnt going to make us dissolve our friendship- he openly said he doesn‚Äôt want this to change anything friendship wise, just make it so were more buddies and not ‚Äòi need you to feel okay‚Äô",33,1737081187.0,TwoXChromosomes,80,0.62,False

The morning was peaceful and we actually got along. We took a nice long car ride and got coffee together. It was a great feeling. Around noon we split, him playing video games and me scrolling on my phone. He comes into the room and starts to pick on me playfully however I just wasn't in the mood. I wasn't even fully annoyed or anything I just didn't want to be messed with and told him to stop twice. He reached for the blanket I had on my lap and tries to snatch it off of me but I caught it and firmly told him to stop for the final time. 

Immeadiately he launches into a tirade: Why can't I be nice to him, why am I treating him like this, that he wasn't even messing with me, etc. I'm still not upset or anything - I just didn't want to be messed with and that me telling him to stop doesn't mean that I wasn't being nice. He attempts gaslighting me by claiming that he wasn't even grabbing for the blanket DESPITE it literally being in his hand. And to that I told him to stop playing stupid, that I saw him with my own two eyes. Again, I'm still not bothered, it's surface level stuff ya'know? I see through him games and know how to handle myself now. It's just like....stop bothering me lol 

He storms out of the room but before doing so he calls me a bitch and flies to the bedroom to slam the door and lock it. He avoids me for the next 2-3 hours. Okay. Not my problem. 

Around 5pm I realize that dinner still needs to be made for our kiddo. The plan was to stop by the store to pick up a nice birthday steak dinner + brownies made by me but he's still doling out the silent treatment. I ended up defrosting some hamburger to at least have something. I swear the second he heard me bounce ideas off our kiddo for dinner he finally left the room and wants to know if we could go to the store with him. Before I even get a full sentence out letting him know that I'm fine with doing that, it's just that I have meat thawing out as a plan B and to give me a sec to put it in the fridge he is, for the second time today, he is walking away from me and heading back to the bedroom to throw a temper tantrum. 

A firm boundary that I've placed for myself is that I do not chase after him. However me still wanting him to have a good birthday dinner even with his poor behavior, I went to him. 

Cue ""The Argument"" -- There's not a single problem on his end, that I'm desperate to argue for no reason, I need to be an adult, I can't let things go (ie him calling me a bitch just mere hours earlier), his communication is perfect and it's me that lacks skills, I must respect him if he doesn't want to talk, blah blah blah. Even with all this BS I'm still asking him to just move forward with me so at the very least *he* can have his birthday dinner. Holy shit. ""Even on my birthday, you're still trying to make it about you"" and with that he slams the door in my face and locks it again. I just want to laugh because it's me that was called names, ignored, and then punished for not going along with his narrative, not him! I should be the one seething with rage! 

I'm still not even hurt, bothered or annoyed by his narcissism. I'm just incredibly frustrated because I've realized that they all play by the same rulebook. I mentally predicted every single action and reaction before he even did it. If anything, I'm more annoyed in myself for continuing to play this game of his. This cycle is deeply maddening and often I just want to ask if he's exhausted by it like I am. But I won't because I know I won't get the answer or closure or security that I deserve. 

That was yesterday and today he tried the route of resetting and acting as if nothing happened, as he always does. No. Something did happen and I'm not going to pretend like it didn't. So now as I write this post it's coming after another rant by him. Unfortunately, he'd rather victimize himself. ",1,1737081028.0,u_melonmoscato,0,1.0,False

In it, Rose asks Lynch if he has ever been to therapy, he answers that ‚Äú*it was only once, because that process could alter his creativity and the way he generates ideas*.‚Äù This is one of the many reasons why I have voluntarily decided not to attend these spaces, without the intention of disparaging the profession of psychoanalysis.

And, of course, not all minds are the same, we are not all born under the same conditions, we don't all have the same privileges or the same genetic background, which strongly influence the chemical processes of our brains. My refuges in times of crisis are established, and they are nothing more than the simple things in life: a good coffee in the morning, an exercise routine, spending time with the people I love and who love me, expressing emotions when necessary, listening to or making music, creating without haste, and even romanticizing chaos in a certain way, all of this within the limits that life itself imposes. Nothing more is needed, everything is there.

If David Lynch, being one of the 90s most prestigious directors, and therefore having a significant net worth with his productions, is told by a psychoanalyst ‚Äîalso prestigious, I suppose‚Äî that therapy can affect his creativity, then what is expected for the other anonymous creatives in the industry? Even people in my close social circle have told me about their experiences and many have been bad, because as in every profession, there are good and bad professionals, many of my friends have had to go from office to office trying to find one that ‚Äú*works for them*,‚Äù which also ends up impacting their own personal economy, because these consultations are not free.

Let us dedicate ourselves to living, but not under the standards of this society of immediacy; let us allow ourselves to live under our own convictions, because that is what the system and unnecessary eagerness want to take away from us.

I live in a City that isn‚Äôt a City type community to where majority of these companies are between 30-50 minutes from me in the next county. I have always been a person who isn‚Äôt a morning person but after I graduated college I was able to manage handling jobs where I worked 11-8, 9-6 and even had a 10-7 job. Most of these companies around me I see are 8-5 and I don‚Äôt think I can handle a 8-5 especially consider the commute I would have to make involves getting up at 6 every morning. I don‚Äôt drink coffee and often explain my frustration to friends that I just think starting a job at 8am is too early. I can handle a 9 start time but 8 these companies should realize that is just doing too much. I don‚Äôt have a family or kids so maybe that‚Äôs why i don‚Äôt feel the need to start a job so early. I have yet to get offered one of those 8-5 but am I just being too picky or is it okay to have a preference because the end of the day I‚Äôm doing it and no one else or if the money is right maybe consider it? I just don‚Äôt know what it is but 8-5 is just sounds brutal to me especially the area the job is in there‚Äôs traffic otw and worst traffic otw back home.

A couple of days of headaches, otherwise experiences and benefits much like those I've enjoyed reading about here.
Some things I haven't seen mentioned so much:
First, I didn't have a mid-afternoon slump on coffee. Instead, I found I was spending the day jumping out of my skin, then just starting to settle down, concentrate and do good work from around 3.30-4.00, after wasting the day. I thought it must be some type of chemical imbalance and had been putting off going to the doctor for years, but finally tried decaf and worked out what had been happening. 
Point 2 - I'm only getting up once or twice a night - not bad for someone my age ... and for most of my life, I've also been putting off having an awkward discussion with my doctor about getting up 5+ times a night.
Better late than never to work these things out, I suppose.
And the intensity of the dreams for the first few months! They've faded lately, sadly.
Anyway, just thought I'd share.

It's my genuine wish that, in the distant future, we'll look back together and remember today as the start of a great and true friendship.  

First, my struggle. You can skip this part. Really. Consider it a preface by a curmudgeonly academic who talks to himself about Walt Whitman and eats many Werther's Originals.  

2024 was an adventure that went nowhere, a tearful year that began with my move to a new city in a new state (literally on New Year's Day) and concluded before I could achieve my top goal: to make a new friend. That's right, I failed to make any friends for an entire year (and counting). Working long hours from home for a company on the opposite coast probably wasn't the best idea; and although I attended movie meetups, joined an astronomy club, hung out on live jazz nights, showed up at my local nature center for group hikes, volunteered for a literacy program, and got a few pretty snazzy haircuts along the way, it just wouldn't, didn't, happen.  

Now maybe you're asking yourself, ""What's wrong with this guy?"" And to that I smile and say, You're not alone; I've been asking myself the same question.  

As someone who loves writing, reading, and all things peaceful, my tendency toward solitude became a real problem for the first time in my life last year. I learned: Without friendship there is no solitude. And when I resolved to ditch the books and pens and reach out for connection, I was surprised to find: silence. By the time I left Thanksgiving cards for my neighbors in the adjacent apartments letting them know how grateful I am to have them nearby, my health was suffering. And when, one day at a time, my neighbors didn't reply, still haven't replied, I have felt loneliness as an actual physical pain. In recent weeks I've taken to buying dinner for the person or people behind me in line at Chipotle just to feel included the world, to enjoy some tiny human connection and kindness. When I did this on my birthday, the woman and her daughter each hugged me; they had no idea and will never know that they provided the highlight of my year.  

Okay, now to the actual post:  

Hello! I am a living human person who values laughter, empathy, nature, hazelnut coffee, the sound of ping-pong being played in an adjoining room, great literature, nostalgia, things that smell really good, dim lighting, live music, new notebooks, acoustic guitars, classic movies, and above all kindness‚Äîand the kindest thing I can think to do for myself (and hopefully for you) is to offer my company, my presence, my friendship here.  

This new year I am all about trying new things. I am excited to report that I have just watched my first anime (Weathering with You); I adored it and subsequently became, oh yes, a Mega Fan on Crunchyroll. I'm listening only to music that is new to me, so please feel free to share your stellar recommendations.
