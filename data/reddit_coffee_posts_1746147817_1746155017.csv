1kcqxry,https://www.reddit.com/r/gastricsleeve/comments/1kcqxry/almost_one_year_post_op/,Almost one year post op,"I had VSG on 5/14/24. In the almost year since then, I’ve lost a total of 120lbs (starting weight 307, day of 295, current 187) and while it feels amazing, I’m terrified. I hear so many people say restriction lessens at a year, and that old habits come back hard. I’m trying so hard to plan and approach things to make sure that doesn’t happen. I have an almost 2.5 year old and he’s one of the big reasons I had surgery. But I find myself putting myself last often, grazing instead of having focused meals, surviving on protein coffee and a cheese stick for hours because I’m busy entertaining him or taking care of him. I want and need to be more focused on planning and tracking. I spent a large portion of my life pre op meticulously tracking my food intake, so I’ve been reluctant to track anything but protein since my surgery. I am working with a dietician but I still struggle daily with eating too fast, or not getting enough water. I know everyone’s journey isn’t linear, and no one is the same…I’m just so scared of “failing” myself and not living up to the compliments people have given me since losing weight (which is so weird and feels awful, at times, to even be acknowledged in this way/for this reason)

I’m not sure what I’m looking for, except to say I need some support. I need to know I am not going to ruin my diet because I use regular coffee creamer or have the occasional chicken nugget. But what if I do? There’s such a fine line between moderation and over indulgence. I’m terrified of falling over the edge. ",1,1746154860.0,gastricsleeve,0,1.0,False

What are some phrases you have ready to go in these cases?

Hi everyone I read this sub a lot but don't think I've posted on it. My in-laws aren't the worst, but every now and then they overstep. The first time MIL majorly overstepped I used a lot of the advice I read on other people's posts on how to handle it.

The first time MIL majorly overstepped was when she yelled at us for not wanting to send a million elopement announcements to everyone on her christmas card list (we eloped in July and she had been holding my husband's family's mailing addresses hostage). After the incident I was adamant we have a serious conversation with her and that she needed to apologize. My husband wanted to just let it go because ""thats just how my mom is"" and ""she's crazy"" but ultimately i convinced him we couldn't ignore something like this. When we did eventually sit down with her and get an apology she pulled the whole ""I'm sorry for yelling at you but you guys never respond to my text messages."" I knew she wasn't completely taking ownership for her actions but it was a step in the right direction, and my husband did have a habit of forgetting to respond. We accepted her apology and carried on as before. That was about a year and a half ago.

I knew that when I got pregnant, they would be on an information diet. We waited until I was in the second trimester, came over to their house, cooked them dinner, and presented them with a champagne bottle with custom label on it (baby last name coming soon). It's their first grandchild so they were very excited. MIL was actually very well behaved and didn't press me for information or pressure me about anything like she had with our wedding/elopement plans. We told them repeatedly that they were not to tell ANYONE. They were the first people we told (other than my boss and best friend) and we were very clear that we wanted to share the news and had a plan to do so when we were ready. Anyway we have dinner, husband, MIL, and FIL drink the champagne and after dinner my husband suggested we play a board game and leaves the table to get one. This is where it all goes wrong.

FIL proceeds to try to get the perfect picture of the bottle and label. MIL reminded him not to send it to anyone, he doesn't respond. Husband walks back into the room, and FIL says ""Aunt says congratulations."" Immediately everyone's jaws drop. MIL is hurling insults at FIL, my heart is racing, husband is in shock, BIL(16) is asking who did you send the picture to. The evening is ruined, husband and I leave and figure out damage control on the drive home. FIL had sent the picture to his 4 siblings, and we wanted to make sure the news didn't make it to my husband's grandparents because we wanted to be the ones to tell them.

That was about 3 weeks ago. Husband and I have decided on what boundaries/rules will be put in place, and plan to have coffee with ILs in a public place to establish them. Even though FIL is the one who messed up here some of the rules are directly related to MILs behavior and she will take things personally. My husband expects her to say things like ""well I guess I'm just a terrible mom"" and to complain about things we do or don't do. 

What are some phrases I can rehearse for when she says these things?

For example, she will try to excuse FILs behavior by saying he was intoxicated. I plan to say something like ""FIL is a large man who drinks regularly. 2 glasses of champagne in an hour with dinner would not have impaired his judgement. He waited until husband left the room to take the picture and send it. He knew what he was doing.""

I also just want to note that there have been several incidents with MIL especially in regards to our wedding. I only bring up the Christmas card incident because it was the worst thing that she did and it highlights how we handled it and her type of responses.

1kcquya,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1kcquya/my_boyfriend_accidentally_threw_away_my/,My boyfriend accidentally threw away my medications.,"We just moved to a new country. It's really hard to get my medications covered and I've had issues every step of the way. They won't refill a majority of them because of my dosage, what they just don't carry, what insurance won't cover, but they wouldn't even look at my insurance information because it's on a document that people keep refusing to read. It’s on an identity document literally one inch to the left of a photograph of my face. I had to pay $140 for an appointment two months ago, and they only filled ONE of my medications. Then, I was told by my case management that everyone should accept that paper, and it is my  insurance paper, and they shouldn't have charged me for it.

I am on two medications to treat Bipolar 1. I was diagnosed 12 years ago. They also won't refill my adderall perscription. I have CPTSD and nightmares that are treated with a sleep aid. I have been on these medications for many years and stable.

I was taking the empty bottles to an appointment to try to have them refilled again. I had been rationing my medications for months, hoarding them before moving, taking doses that are too low, and going through hell because of it. I've had volatile moods and experiencing mania and hypomania, and paused using the adderall because of it.

I had about one week of one medication left. I had 3 weeks of the other, because I halved my dose to try to sustain it because of how hard it's been to get any help at all. I had 8 adderall left because I had only been taking them when going to hearings, or meetings, or something I need to be more functional and attentive for. I had 2 weeks of the sleep aid. I'd been taking half doses of everything and just trying to keep it together until I could go back to full doses when I could consistently get refills. 

I put my medications in a cup, with them divided by napkins and wrapped, to make sure they were safe, so I'm not carrying my few remaining meds and walking around. 

I told my boyfriend. ""I put my medications in a cup on the counter in the kitchen so I'm not hauling them around.""

I finished getting ready. I cleaned up after our dog. I put the dog matter into the trash can and prepared to pull the trash. 

I looked, and the cup was empty. My heart dropped. I asked him if he threw away my meds. 

He did. I broke down. I had a panic attack. I immediately tried to dig through the bag while sobbing. Of course, it's full of dog shit and a dripping piss pad. He started to dig through it. He ""saved"" a few of my loose meds as I wept and asked if he could save any more. They're pills, so of course they fell to the bottom and into wet coffee grounds. 

I look. They're covered in dog piss and coffee grounds. He puts them in the cup, and they're all melted and fucked up, and the adderall has turned into wet dust. I have the worst panic attack I've had in years. I break down. I cry. 

We go to try to get my meds refilled and I'm shut down. They won't do it. Again, refusing to read my very clear insurance information. 

I successfully get one partially refilled because I connect with the doctor, and let her know they're technically seizure medication thay can cause withdrawals. I have a history of seizures and aneurysms in my family. They called around to the insurance. I ended up badgering them for over an hour, and they eventually broke and partially filled two. I come back home and break down because they didn't return any of my papers.

I have to go back. I really harp on that seizure part. They refill one bottle entirely. I go home and I'm still crushed, and defeated, and broken, and crying. And he's upset too, of course. I don't want to blame him for an accident, but that was ALL of my medications. For months. Our circumstances means I'm at the mercy of a system that is no way in my favor.

He was out of medications for ONE day, a few weeks ago. And he got to go in, and they were covered and refilled. No fight. No begging. No payment. 

I'm charged 30 dollars for a signature and they can't fill them. There's a rehab center next door and they won't fill my adderall in case I decide to walk outside and sell them in the parking lot. Now, why in the fuck would I do that?

Now, predictably, it's tense with my boyfriend. It's an accident, and I got some of my meds partially refilled. You can't just stop medications like that cold turkey, especially in an already scary and volatile situation. 

I think anyone with a mental illness, limited access to their medication, with nothing, would break down. My wailing of ""oh my god,"" and sobbing was taken personally. I shouldn't have yelled. I didn't yell at him, but being panicked, I was loud and in distress. 

I'm devastated. I'm scared. I'm hurt. It was not an intentional betrayal, but it was EVERYTHING. It was every one of my medications. Getting to refill any of them was like pulling teeth. I had to stand there and, one by one, be told they won't dispense my medications. 

And that's all I could do. I'm sad and hurt and scared. My medications are the last line of defense on my cracking psyche. I can hope and pray and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and cross my fingers and knock on wood, but they doesn't mean that there couldn't be very dangerous consequences for abruptly not having any of my medications. What if they wouldn't refill any of them? What if the clinic was closed? What if they charged me $300 and I'd have to tuck my tail and tell them I can't afford that? Because that's what nearly happened when I had to pay $140 last time. 

I'm looking for a therapist. I'm looking for a psychiatrist. I'm trying to keep it together, and get back into mental health treatment, and get help. We're rental hopping with no money left. I can't do anything else about it, except accept my fate of being perpetually punched down on by the world.

I go to work on time, wear modest clothes, and make small talk with coworkers like I have nothing to hide. But as soon as the door closes behind me and I’m alone with him… I’m not even close to the same person.

We don’t label it. He’s not my boyfriend. He’s not even someone I see that often in public. But when I get that “you’re coming over tonight” text, I already know what I’m in for — and I never say no.

He has rules. I wear what he tells me. I kneel when he says so. I’ve been blindfolded, restrained, even gagged. One time he made me keep a little toy in while we went out for drinks, and I had to sit there and act completely normal while he held the remote in his pocket — teasing me under the table.

He calls me his “filthy little secret,” and I am. No one would believe how submissive I become the moment he touches me. I crave the humiliation. I love that no one would guess how depraved I really am when I’m bent over for him, begging for permission to come.

I go back to work the next day like nothing happened — hair tied up, polite smile, coffee in hand — knowing full well I had bruises from the night before and still felt sore in the best way.

Sometimes I wonder what people would think if they saw the videos. But the truth? I hope they never find out. Because this secret life — it’s mine, and I’ve never felt more wanted, more used, or more alive.

We met 2019 pero nung 2020 (pandemic era) nag stay na ako sa bahay nila for good dahil sya lang and younger brother nasa philippines sa family nya. Lahat nasa US na.

Moving forward yung brother nya is nasa Bulacan na nag stay, sa girlfriend nya din. Basically sya yung parang kakampi ko din kasi parehas kami ng mga reklamo sa bahay haha.

So 2 years ago nai pasok ko sa work yung girlfriend ko and need mag training for 3 weeks walang uwian. So ang ginawa ng mother nya na nasa US is pinapunta dito sa bahay yung tito nya and yung anak ng tito nya. Okay naman sila kasama sa bahay nung una pero natapos yung 3 weeks hindi na sila umalis, maganda kasi location ng bahay, magandang village and bawal ang trycicle sa loob so tahimik talaga. From tarlac naka tira yung tito nga nagkataon nagka problema sila don nung anak nya kaya napadpad dito sa manila. Yung other relatives naman nila nasa san mateo.

So until now andito pa rin yung tito nya, pabor naman sa GF ko kasi may nag aalaga ng aso namin may nagluluto at mabait naman talaga. Ang problema, una sa lahat syempre nasanay kaming dalawa lang na nasa bahay na mimiss ko yung privacy. Pangalawa, parang naging entitled wala naman syang inaambag, binabayaran pa nga sya sa pag stay. One time nag sabi kami na mag grocery, ang sabi ba naman sakin “bili ka nga ng ano creamer!” Parang iritable na way. Yung CR din namin halos dalawang hakbang lang sa ginagamit nyang kwarto, dun pa umiihi pag gabi sa loob ng kwarto nya gamit ang naubos na lalagyanan ng coffee mate. Tapos sa labas ng bahay umiihi din sya. Sobrang panghi ng paligid!

Mahilig din sya magluto ng isda na hindi ko alam kung anong klase. (Sorry po, sobrang selan kasi ng pang amoy ko) yung tipong isang linggo bago mawala ang lansa ng bahay.

Mabait sya pero may mga kwento sya na naiiba sa mata ng mga nasa US na relatives. Nag bibida bida sya. Iniisip ko baka lagi kasi ako nabibigyan ng kung ano ano e hindi ko naman hinihingi yun sa family ng gf ko at sila mismo nag bibigay tinatanggihan ko na nga din.

Siniraan nya na din ako sa mga anak nya like hindi daw ako bumabati sa kanya. Nagtataka ako kasi panong hindi ko sya babatiin or kakausapin e magkasama naman kami lagi sa bahay. Binago ko yung treatment, lagi ko na sya binabati kahit nonsense.

Sobrang tight ng family nila like kahit mga malalayong pinsan, ang treatment is parang first or main family, sobrang daming redflags kasi sila GF ang may kaya sa buong family nila kaya yung ibang relatives parang laging may opinion regarding sa akin. Hindi naman sa pag yayabang pero maganda naman ang trabaho ko at ang pamilya ko ay kaya din naman makipag sabayan sa family nila in terms of money.


Gusto ko nalang umuwi samin, pero hindi ko maiwan GF ko dahil magiging dalawa nalang sila sa bahay and nasanay na syang magkasama kami palagi. Hindi ko din naman maaya bumukod dahil una sa lahat bahay nya yung tinitirahan namin.


Masarap mamuhay ng walang ibang iniintindi or kasama sa bahay at yung privacy din namin as mag partner pero pano nga ba namin magagawa? 

Yun lang! Gusto ko lang maglabas ng inis hahaha sarap manapak.

1kcqs6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kcqs6j/im_not_my_best_friends_best_friend_and_i_maybe/,I'm not my best friend's best friend and I maybe never was.,"I've made my first reddit account purely because I need to get this out. 

  
I, 18 male, grew up pretty isolated and didn't have close friends for years.  I was pretty quiet and when I did make friends I would normally find out that they were just using me or pity friending me.  Because of this, I'm not good at identifying things within friendships and I don't know how to deal with situations like this.

At the end of my sophomore year of high school I met my friend, who I'll call Rome, 18 male. He was nice to me and seemed genuinely interested in me as a person. At the start of our Junior year I joined his friend group where everyone was kind and accepting. I want to make it clear that I love the people in my friend group and although I am hurt by the situation, I don't blame them.  

After joining the friend group I met someone who I'll call Julian, 19 male. We became really fast friends and he admitted to me that he had also not really made close friends before. I felt like he understood me and with his help, along with Rome and the rest of the group, I grew in confidence and became more outgoing. By summer, me and Julian were talking about living together after high school and I considered him my best friend. I never told him though, I don't really know if that's something you're supposed to do. I was closer to Julian than I'd ever been to anyone. 

  
Side note: I don't want to come off like I abandon Rome. Yes, he brought be to the friend group but we didn't click like I did with Julian. We don't leave him out and I still consider him one of my favorite people, and he knows this. He also has had a best friend since before we ever met and I think his bf is a very cool/kind guy. Rome is OKAY. 

  
At the beginning of our senior year another guy joined the group. Nick, 18 male. Nick was EXTREMELY shy, more shy than I used to be. But Julian and I  through he was really cool and started hanging out with him as trio sometimes and he also came out of his shell. Nick clearly always liked Julian better thought. When I found out they were hanging out one on one I didn't think too much of it. But by the spring semester I started to realize my dilemma. I would ask Julian to hang out and half the time he'd say ""sorry, I'm hanging with Nick."" or ""Nick and I were gonna get coffee, but you're welcome to tag along."" This was also around the time Rome started dating his girl friend. I felt like no one had time for me and was honestly really lonely. (still am.) 

In the summer, me and Julian were working at the same place so I got to see him most days. Summer was actually pretty great as we would hang out after work at least three times a week. Yes, Nick was normally there but, after a six hour shift of goofing off with Julian it wasn't so bad. Also, I do still love Nick. I'm writing this out of frustration but Nick didn't actually do anything wrong and he's still fun to be around.

After summer, some of the friend group moved away due to college leaving only myself, Julian, Rome, and Nick in the same city. 

Me and Rome started to notice that Julian and Nick were kinda turning into the same person. They dressed the same, they talked the same, they listened to the same music. We started joking that they would start dating. So yeahhh....they started dating. They told us A MONTH AFTER. They didn't tell us they were dating for a full month. They started telling everyone their ""perfect love story."" How they had been best friends basically since they first met, how they knew they were meant for each other. This sounds sappy because I'm writing while angry but they really are happy together and I genuinely think they'll get married some day.

At this point in writing this I don't know what my objective is. I just hate that everyone is choosing other people above me. I hate that no one has seemed to notice how this would hurt me. I've talked to Rome a bit about it and he knows that I don't like that their best friends but other than that I've kept it to myself. I'm just so angry that I can't blame anyone but myself. I can't make people choose me. 

And yes, I know the answer is probably just to tell them how I feel. I just can't seem too. I know how guilty they would feel and don't want everyone to feel as bad as me. I'm just heartbroken and angry and theres nothing I can do about it.

I don't know where I went wrong. I think I'm an enjoyable person to be around. I think I'm a good friend. 

literally any advise would help. I'm clearly doing something wrong when it comes to friendships. I've had failed friendships before but I could always blame them(seriously, one of them was a shit person)

1kcqraj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1kcqraj/was_this_purely_a_professional_date_or_something/,Was this purely a professional date or something more?,"Hey all,

Need to run a scenario by y'all and get your advice. I'm a 1L (first year) law student who recently asked and went on a coffee ""date"" with a 3L.
 A little back story before getting into the date itself. The girl I went on a date with was my bailiff at my oral arguments. we talked briefly before and after that in-person but it was all regarding the arguments itself. After that we glanced at each other at our annual law school prom and on the elevator once. Then, I randomly decided to ask her to a date via email just by searching her law school email. I opened by saying I think she was my bailiff, but more importantly, that I was interested in learning about her experience in the peer-to-peer mentoring program. (Mostly BS) After a few days she actually got back to me and accepted the offer to get coffee. The ""date"" itself went great and lasted for about 40 minutes, after the beginning, most our topics didn't cover the peer program but went to a lot of small talk about our lives before law school and where we grew up. (A silly observation since this is how most convos go but the eye contact was pretty intense, even when we were standing close to each other getting our coffeee) 
At the end I asked for her phone number so I could ""follow up with her if I had any questions about the law review in the future"" she gladly gave me her phone and number but said that she would text me (although as she said that I texted myself on her phone). We then said our goodbyes. 
So I initially thought that her saying she would text me was a sign she was romantically interested. But then I thought that it could actually of been setting professional boundaries. I think I've said the same thing to people I don't want to text before. 
Final details: even though she is a upper classman, we are the same age. We are also probably in the same league but she is a bit more charismatic than I am. 

So my question is, was this purely a professional date? Or something more? It's also important to note that the peer program is pretty trivial at the law school and this is actually a busy time because finals are next week. This makes it noteable that she actually accepted the coffee invitation.

Thanks for your help on this!

1kcqoxt,https://i.redd.it/bjfhvesf6aye1.jpeg,Sunset Van Camp Honest Review,"Now that I am recovered from W2, I thought I should give an honest review of the new Sunset Van Camp pre-set van camping option. Me and my friends booked this pretty last minute (group of 4 of us). Some have been to Coachella 9 times, 1 it was his first! 

Anyways, here's the review for anyone who may look into this for 2026...Worth every penny. 

The van itself is fully prepped when you arrive - clean sheets, a crazy comfortable bed w/ 4 pillows, a duvet, fans, a large window AC unit cranking at 65 degrees, utensils, plates, coffee mugs, cups, coozies, stove w/ water boil (late night ramen saved me every night at 3am), a full size cooler, camp chairs. Literally, I am not sure what they didn't think of in these vans. The company that provides the van is called Moterra. I looked up their website and what you get at Coachella is exactly what you get if you book on their site (and I think more based on what we had available to us). 

Bathrooms: private AC bathrooms only for the campers in the village meant extremely clean bathrooms. These were a lifesaver.

Lounge area: They have a lounge area where me and my friends were able to decompress after a long day for like 3 hours. Listening to music and having some drinks and unwinding. More campers camp to join and it was like a little after party of 15-20 of us. Super chill and fun. 

Security: There was always a sunset van camp ""staff"" member (the owners of the van company, moterra) and security at the front. I knew my shit wasn't going to get stolen, so that's a plus. Either way, they have an app where you lock the van. So it's not like you have to carry around a key. Which is great because I would have lost it 100%. 

Sleeping: Bed 5 stars. AC cranking to the point I was cold AF and had to sleep with pants and a top on because I refused to turn off the AC lol. Blackout curtains/shades on all windows. I was able to sleep until my heart desired (which was pretty damn late every day). 

Location: unbeatable. 1.5 minute walk to the entrance. 

Cons: TBH i really can't think of one. Maybe the fact that I ubered and got dropped off and had to wheel my bags to camp, but I think that's my own fault and not that big of a deal honestly. 

Other con: i can't find it on the site yet.. Hoping it comes back.",5,1746154063.0,Coachella,2,1.0,False
1kcqlpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/1kcqlpk/star_wars_practically_gives_me_narcolepsy_and_my/,Star Wars Practically Gives Me Narcolepsy and my boyfriend is bummed—what do I do?,"My boyfriend is a huge Star Wars fan. I’ve never seen any of the movies, despite him suggesting it a million times. On a recent vacation to Las Vegas, he bought us tickets to see Revenge of the Sith in a 4D theater. Leading up to the trip, he tried showing me the first two movies, but I could not stay awake for the life of me.

He said it was fine—he figured there was no way I’d fall asleep during a 4D movie, and he hoped that seeing part of the plot would finally get me interested enough to go back and watch the others.

Well… we went, and despite the moving seats, water spraying in my face, and fake wind blowing at me, I fell asleep ten minutes in. I fought it so hard—I tried sitting on the edge of my seat, making myself uncomfortable on purpose, but I could not stay awake. I ended up sleeping through the entire movie. He was definitely annoyed.

After we got home, he asked if we could give Episode I another shot. He asked in the morning, after a full night of sleep and after I slammed two coffees. You’ll never guess what happened: I fell asleep again, 10 minutes in. I don’t know what it is—Star Wars just knocks me out like a tranquilizer.

I try to focus, but my mind drifts no matter what. I literally cannot find it entertaining. The third one held my attention for a bit because of the love story between Anakin and that one lady, but once the fighting started again, I was out. It’s just so much fighting, and I can’t bring myself to be invested in any type of fighting.

My boyfriend is sad and says he’s giving up on trying to show me the movies. I care because he cares and I want to be involved in his interests. What do I do?? Am I gonna need to take a stimulant at this point?",2,1746153778.0,StarWars,8,0.67,False

No abuse, he just wasn’t a great person and had a lot of issues and after the yelling at me, coma thing, I ended everything, and we had only talked maybe one or two times since then.

He was a minor (self described as “vaguely anonymous”) celebrity in my city, known as a banksy-esque street artist who got to travel to different cities for art shows, even released one - maybe two - coffee table books. He has some murals on buildings throughout the city and it’s been weird seeing them and knowing that now he’s gone, and knowing that we knew each other while he was here.

I have some photos and videos in my phone from times that we had been together in the past and I look back on those memories I have stored in my phone fondly.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**1. What makes IPTVGREAT the best IPTV service in Norway?**  
Great question! IPTVGREAT stands out because of its massive library (140,000+ live channels and 100,000+ VOD options), ultra-stable servers with Anti-Freeze tech, and affordable pricing ($14/month). Plus, it’s been my personal go-to for three years—zero buffering, even during peak hours!

**2. Is IPTV legal in Norway?**  
IPTV itself is legal, but *content access* depends on licensing. Always choose reputable providers like IPTVGREAT, IPTVFOLLOW, or IPTVUNLOCK, which prioritize licensed streams. Avoid sketchy services offering ""too good to be true"" deals—they often violate copyright laws.

**3. Will IPTV work on my smart TV or Fire Stick?**  
Absolutely! The best IPTV providers support all devices, including Smart TVs, Fire Sticks, Android/iOS, and even laptops. IPTVGREAT even offers 24/7 support to help with setup—just download their app or use a player like IPTV Smarters.

**4. How does IPTVGREAT compare to cable TV?**  
Cable TV can’t compete! For a fraction of the price, you get way more channels (including international and premium sports), on-demand content, and no long-term contracts. Oh, and did I mention *zero buffering* with Anti-Freeze tech?

**5. What’s the best IPTV subscription for sports fans?**  
If live sports and PPV events are your jam, IPTVUNLOCK is a beast (check out [iptvunlock.com](https://iptvunlock.com)). But IPTVGREAT also delivers 4K sports streams—perfect for Premier League, NFL, or UFC fights.

**6. Can I try before I buy?**  
Most top providers offer trials or money-back guarantees. IPTVGREAT occasionally runs free trials—keep an eye on their site ([iptvgreat.me](https://iptvgreat.me)) or ask their support team.

**7. Why does some IPTV buffer or freeze?**  
Usually, it’s due to weak servers or overcrowded networks. That’s why I recommend providers like IPTVGREAT—their Anti-Freeze tech and stable servers eliminate this issue. Also, check your internet speed (at least 25 Mbps for HD).

**8. How do I pay securely for an IPTV subscription?**  
Stick to providers with trusted payment gateways (PayPal, credit cards). Avoid sketchy sites asking for crypto or bank transfers. IPTVRESALE ([iptvresale.com](https://iptvresale.com)) even offers secure reseller plans if you want to start your own business.

**9. Can I share my IPTV subscription with family?**  
Most providers allow multiple simultaneous streams (IPTVGREAT offers 2-5 depending on the plan). Just confirm their policy—some limit by IP address to prevent abuse.

**10. What’s the best IPTV provider for 2025?**  
Based on reliability and updates, IPTVGREAT still leads the pack for 2025. But IPTVFOLLOW is a close second for binge-watchers, with insane VOD updates. Both keep improving their servers and content libraries yearly!

I've been offered a SM job from Starbucks to be placed in 1 of the many new locations opening in my area. Currently a SM for a large retail corporation and have been for well over 5 years leading stores with a yearly revenue of 6-10 Million. 

While i do not possess previous coffee house experience i am eager to learn and although an SM i am a very apparent and supportive leader to my team.  Looking for insight on the in's and out's of the day to day.

\-What do you feel as a Barista, Shift Supervisor, ASM you need from an SM to feel supported and buy in to the culture and day to day operations?

\-In previous SM's how much bar time do you see them doing? -On the flip side of that- How much bar time would you like to see them doing?

\-New leadership can be scary and intimidating. What helps soften that for you so that you feel motivated to do your best and help with transition?

\-Do you feel starbucks is a generally good place to work? I recognize that there have been significant changes as of recently but zooming out and looking at the wide scope, what rating out of 10  would you give it? If possible please explain the reasoning behind the rating.

  
Thank you all in advance!

Just trying to get as much info to make an informed decision and if accepted be the best leader for and with my team.",2,1746152777.0,starbucks,0,1.0,False

**Sam’s Road Trip:**

Sam isn’t sure when the new neighbour moved in but he remembers clearly the first time he saw the ’67 Camaro with California plates gleaming in the driveway. The candy apple red paint defiant against the early-spring grey and beige of the suburban neighbourhood. Nobody ever saw it leave but they heard it prowling through the neighbourhood, perhaps still on West Coast time.

It takes a week before Sam spots Brad, the tan square-jawed owner. It’s not because he’s hard to spot. On the contrary: he’s blonde with bright white teeth, sculpted muscles, and a meticulously curated style designed to give a laid-back California vibe. Rather it seems as though he went out of his way to not be spotted, nobody ever saw him. Nobody except Sam. Sam who had the place staked out.

Of course Sam had seen classic cars before. Usually they were hobby projects for weekend drives and Tuesday night shows, the slushy salt-encrusted Canadian streets being no place for such a flamboyant antique. Truth be told he wasn’t even that interested in old cars but there was something different about this one. It was Dave who suggested that Sam, who’d been thinking of going to school for journalism, do a story on it.

“I’m new here, but are the bushes outside of my house where the neighbourhood kids usually hang out?” Brad finally asks one day.

“Uh, yes. I mean no. I mean, I’m doing a story for the Valley Voice. About your car.”

“Valley Voice? Not sure I’ve heard of that one,” Brad replies cooly.

“I started it myself. I mean, I’m working on starting it. As a blog. I’m thinking about going into journalism.”

“Are we in a valley?”

“The Don Valley. I wanted to name it after local geography, like the Georgia Straight. And a nod to the Village Voice.”

“Huh. Journalism’s a tough gig these days.”

“I think that makes it more important,” Sam replies, completely earnestly.

“Well how can I say no to another writer?”

Sam’s eyes grow wide. “Writer?” He asks.

“Yeah, but I make my stories up. I used to write in Hollywood.”

“Hollywood?!” Sam stammers. “Like movies and stuff?”

“Like movies and stuff,” Brad repeats, folding his thick arms across his broad chest and flashing a Hollywood smile.

“That’s so cool!” Sam fawns.

“I suppose. It’s a tough industry, though. Almost as tough as journalism.”

Sam bursts into the house after their meeting, “You won’t believe what Brad does for a living!”

“Who’s Brad?” Morley asks.

“The car guy!” Sam answers. “He’s a writer in Hollywood!”

“Hollywood? Seems to me he’s a writer in Scarborough,” Dave says.

“Well he’s not in Hollywood now!” Sam replies indignantly.

“I guess that’s true,” Dave says thoughtfully. “Anything we might’ve seen?”

“I didn’t think to ask.”

A week later Sam’s story is finished so he brings it for Brad to review. “Pretty good for a fifteen year-old,” is the verdict.

“Seventeen,” Sam corrects.

“Seventeen? That’s old enough to drive the Camaro.”

“Really?”

“Sure, why not? Let me grab a sweater.” Brad disappears inside the house and emerges in a stylish knit cardigan before tossing Sam the keys.

To Sam’s surprise the car works just the same as any other, except everything is old and manual. Inside it’s dark and worn, well cared for but there’s a split in the dash and nothing quite goes along willingly.

“It’s patina,” Brad says. “It’s got personality.”

They drive slowly around the block before Brad suggests they grab a couple of burgers at the end of the street. Brad points to a parking spot away from the other cars and the two eat leaning on the hood. Sam can’t help but notice how people look and smile, a couple of older men stop by to chat. Sam blushes when Kelsey Wong and Mackenzie Brooks from class wave as they walk past but sits up straighter when he notices how Brad just smiles right back.

It’s a few months later when Sam floats the idea of the road trip. Dave and Carl Lowbeer had been planning a fishing weekend that became two weeks with their wives after Greta and Morley saw where the men were staying. Carl’s friend, a retired mining engineer, owned a lodge on an island up north they were free to use as long as they liked. Sam volunteered to cater the moment he saw the kitchen: it was something he thought only existed on television. The problem was that his employer, Mr. Harmon, needed Sam at the grocery store two days after the others were to leave.

“Maybe we can take a run up in the Camaro,” Brad suggests after Sam complained. “Top down, good music, good food, good views. A little writer’s retreat.”

“Do you know how far it is?” Asks Sam.

“That’s what the Camaro’s for,” Brad replies. “Long road trips in the sun.”

Morley is less concerned with the distance than she is with the driver. “He can’t be more than twenty-five,” she says, later that day.

“He’s twenty-seven,” Sam protests.

“That car has got to be twice as old,” Morley counters.

“You just don’t like him.”

“I don’t…he seems…” Morley falters.

“When Dad was a year older he was touring in old vans with bands. It’s not like it’s a Margaret Atwood story.”

\*\*\*

The round headlights blink on and the engine roars to life well before sunrise on that warm August morning, the smell of gasoline and the artisanal coffee Sam had brought from Mr. Harmon’s and brewed carefully himself wafting on the air. As they pull out of the neighbourhood Brad scrolls around on his phone before his all Bruce Springsteen mix booms from the speakers. It doesn’t take long until they’re cruising up highway four-hundred in the first light of dawn watching the southbound commuter traffic already piling up.

In Barrie Brad pulls into a generic specialty coffee chain where he and Sam stow the convertible top. Brad then heads for the store, stopping halfway and pointing back at Sam, suggesting more coffee. Sam replies that he still has some, thanks, and Brad claps his hands together saying something about fuelling up for a great day. He returns with two large cups of burnt-tasting coffee. There’s no cup holders so Sam holds the hot coffee between his thighs while he finishes the one he brought.

Urban sprawl gives way to farms which give way to deciduous forest as the growling engine propels them northward into the granite and pine of the Canadian shield. In Huntsville Sam asks if maybe they could play some Broken Social Scene and Brad says he can do one better before putting on Bat Out of Hell. In North Bay Brad stops at another coffee chain and returns with two more large cups. By now Sam’s ears are droning, his body is buzzing, and he’s getting a sunburn so he asks to put the top up. Brad replies that this is what the car is made for and what Californians live for before gunning the engine and passing the truck ahead of them.

They stop for lunch at a converted train station in an ex-lumber town. Sam’s ears are ringing after the engine is finally silenced and his skin feels crispy, he’s jittery from all the coffee. The town is quiet and smells of freshwater lakes and pine, a combination of crumbling company town relics and rustic independence. Sam waves Brad ahead, needing a moment to collect his thoughts. He sits on the curb in front of the car and holds his head, massaging his scalp. The gleaming paint is spattered in bugs and Sam feels like he must be too. He notices a fat pink wound in the front driver-side wheel arch where a thick chunk of body filler has freed itself from a shoddy repair job.

Inside Brad has found a seat and is charming the waitress. There’s two bottles of beer on the table. When Brad sees Sam he waves him over and introduces the woman, a rugged thirty-something. An indigenous girl not much older than Sam is wearing a green smock at the cash, rolling her eyes at the flirtations as she chews gum and reads a book. The restaurant is empty, save for the four of them.

“Did you know there’s a chunk missing out of your car?” Sam asks when the waitress moves on.

“Whereabouts?” Brad asks, unconcerned.

Sam explains.

“Ah, yeah, it’s been like that for a while. Character.”

Sam doesn’t say much as the two eat their lunch but it doesn’t matter because Brad fills the silence with a monologue comparing Ontario, particularly the north, with the virtues of California. When Sam finally questions why Brad left he says that Hollywood is too political but a person of his talent could certainly find a job in the Canadian film industry. Outside he sees the waitress smoking a cigarette and admiring the Camaro so he excuses himself, in case she has any questions.

Sam’s glad for the silence as he watches Brad smile and gesticulate at the waitress from the window. The cashier flops down across from him, slouching. She reaches for Sam’s untouched beer and takes a swig before feigning interest in the label.

“Your friend’s kind of an asshole,” she says, not making eye contact.

“What makes you say that?” Sam asks, wondering which is her preferred reason.

“Well, Kim likes him. That’s usually a good indicator.”

“She certainly seems to,” Sam replies listlessly, watching the two of them flirt.

“It just sucks to sit here and listen to him bash my hometown. Believe me, I know we could be doing better but part of doing better is being your best self and guys like that always want you to be something other than yourself, which is impossible. It’s how they keep the upper hand, and people always listen to the confident guy because they’re insecure. Sure we’re not California, but we’re also not California. Why can’t we be just as cool in our own way?”

Outside Kim is in the passenger seat. The Camaro roars to life and Brad backs it out of the parking spot, bright white smile and aviators glinting in the sun.

“Looks like you might be here for a while,” the girl says.

“He’s probably just taking her around the block,” Sam replies.

“If that’s what the kids are calling it these days.”

The two are quiet for a moment.

“I’m Sam by the way,” he holds out his hand.

She takes it. “Cindy.”

“What are you reading?” Sam points to the book sticking out of the pocket of Cindy’s smock.

“Oh, it’s Stuart McLean. Do you know him?”

Sam says that he doesn’t.

“He died a few years ago but he used to do this show on CBC with musical guests and short stories about this nice family, in Toronto I think? I’m not sure he could make it if he was starting out today, he’s so wholesome and hopeful. People want to be depressed these days. I feel like you can tell different stories about the same reality: hopeful or pessimistic. Stuart McLean covered some really human stuff but he did it so hopefully, you know? I get it, there’s some messed up stuff going on in the world. But I’d still rather have him tell the story. Ha, maybe he could get Margaret Atwood for the tricky stuff.”

\*\*\*

Sam and Cindy talk for nearly an hour, there were no other customers. He tells her all about his upcoming culinary holiday and working at Mr. Harmon’s store. She tells him about growing up in the North and then going away to school, she’s going to be a lawyer. Cindy was only two years older than Sam but it seemed like it could have been fifty. He was smitten. It almost made it hard for him to be angry with Brad since he got to spend more time with her.

“You know there’s a train coming in,” she says.

“You have to go back to work?” He asks.

“No. Well, yes. Not really…I mean you could get on it. It goes right by where you’re headed. It’s Ontario Northland, so it’s not exactly luxury but it’s better than waiting for him.”

Sam thinks about this for a moment. “I’ve never taken the train before.”

“It’s an adventure, then.”

“It’s an adventure,” Sam repeats, thinking it over as he speaks the words. “Alright.”

“Come on, then,” Cindy says and hurries to the cash. “The train’s due any time. It’s a little expensive but if you don’t tell anyone I’ll give you a discount.”

“Alright,” says Sam, following.

The train pulls in just as they got to the cash. “Better hurry,” Cindy says as she hands Sam the ticket.

“Thanks,” Sam replies. “Thanks for everything.”

Cindy smiles and Sam rushes out to the platform. Then he comes running back in.

“I told you to hurry!” She says.

Sam holds out his phone. “I’d like to stay in touch.”

She smiles. “Sure.” Then puts her number into his contacts. She waves to the conductor outside to make sure he waits, and Sam runs back to the platform.",1,1746152559.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

I work in an org that’s doing some high-impact things right now. During my time here, a full-time (FTE) role opened up on a sister team that aligns really closely with what I’m already doing. I figured, why not take the shot?

I went through all 5 rounds of interviews, plus an additional chat with the hiring manager. Everything felt solid. Then came the news: I didn’t get the role.

Being internal, it was a bit awkward. I still see the team regularly—we share the same office space, even the same kitchen. It’s like running into an ex at every coffee break.

The manager of the team I interviewed with actually set up a 1:1 afterward to talk it through, which I appreciated. He told me, and I’m paraphrasing here:

“Everyone you spoke with—including the bar raiser—felt like you should be an Amazonian. But for this specific role, we were concerned. It’s a high-pressure position with tight timelines. You’d probably have to work unsustainable hours just to keep up and avoid being put on Focus. And if that happened, odds are you’d be out within a year. We think you’re great—we just don’t want to set you up to fail.”

At first, it stung. But reading stories here about how hard it can be once you’re put on Focus—and how quickly things can spiral when your manager doesn’t fully see your value—it really made me reflect.

Maybe being at Amazon without all the stress of an FTE role isn’t the worst thing. I’m still here, still working my role, on my same team, with my same work. Sometimes, the opportunity that passes you by is actually saving you from a much bigger headache",8,1746152548.0,amazonemployees,0,1.0,False

I have extreme anxiety and OCD so idk if it’s that.,"Two summers ago, I was in Brazil with my boyfriend when my childhood best friend tragically passed away. I was heartbroken and felt deep guilt for not speaking to him in the months before his death—because my boyfriend didn’t want me talking to other men, even old friends. I left Brazil early to attend the funeral, and while I needed emotional support, my boyfriend was upset I left and didn’t seem to grasp how devastating the loss was. I felt completely alone.

While he remained in Brazil, we had a series of emotional arguments. During one fight, I threatened to break up like we had done in the past, ( as we were young and a little immature at the time) not meaning it. But this time, he agreed. He started expressing doubt about our future and said he wanted to raise his kids in Brazil one day. I was crushed. I had believed we were close to getting engaged. Instead, I spiraled into my lowest point—barely eating, not sleeping, and consumed by anxiety and fear of losing him. Though we stayed together, my sense of emotional safety was badly shaken.

Back at college for my senior year, things were still tense between us, and I felt extremely alone on campus. My best friend had moved off campus, my sister (my roommate) was always with her boyfriend, and most of my other friends had graduated. I prayed to find new friends but struggled. I’ve always found it easier to befriend men, especially since they tend to show interest if they find you attractive. One day, a guy on campus introduced himself, and later we connected on Instagram. He responded to one of my stories, and our conversation led to hanging out.

When we met up to study, and he asked me about my summer. I ended up getting emotional and crying as I opened up about how painful my summer was—losing my best friend, and all the issues I had with my boyfriend. I apologized, and he was kind, telling me he was glad to be there to listen. I think part of me hoped he’d want to be my friend, even if it was because he liked me, because I was desperate for companionship.

Later, we went out for coffee, and he brought up my boyfriend again— I think because we had left our last conversation off with me crying about him and my late best friend. I ended up telling him about my relationship concerns. I admitted I was frustrated about not being engaged yet, and told him about the emotional distance and uncertainty I’d been feeling. I told him about some of my fears with my relationship etc. At the same time, I made sure to say, “But I love him and can’t let him go,” because that was always true. I never doubted that I wanted to stay with my boyfriend. Still, I think I subconsciously made my issues sound more dramatic, maybe to keep this guy’s interest as a friend or listener. But I never saw him as anything more. I have always done this even with my female friends. I used to like to stir the pot for a response (I know, toxic lowkey I’m not proud). I think this is where I fear if it was cheating or not. Because I wonder if me wanting him to have interest in me so he would want to be my friend is considered unfaithful. I never flirted with him or anything but if in my mind I was hoping he would have a little crush so he would want to be my friend more? Is that bad if I don’t directly say anything or flirt? Or is that just an intrusive thought?

I tried to set him up with my friends—both to make my intentions clear and maybe distract him if he did like me. But I also worried that if he started dating someone, I’d be alone again. It wasn’t jealousy, just fear of isolation. He paid for my coffee, wiped spilled coffee off my hand, and offered me his jacket—but I made sure not to wear it, as that felt like something too intimate.

Eventually, I told my boyfriend everything. I had looked up whether having a guy friend was wrong, and most said keeping it a secret was. I didn’t want to hurt him, and I loved him. As soon as I told him, I cut off contact with the guy. I didn’t hesitate obviously I felt bad for cutting off a friend randomly but I had told him how my bf didn’t like me having guy friends because I had told him about my deceased friend so I think he understood.

Since then, I’ve been tormented by guilt. I’ve wondered daily if what I did was cheating—even though I never flirted, never wanted him, and never imagined being with him. I thought I was keeping things respectful and honest. But now, I constantly fear that I crossed a line I didn’t mean to.

This happened almost two years ago. I have not been able to let it go with fear that I cheated. I take cheating very seriously and also have really bad moral OCD that has been diagnosed so I don’t know if it is that or if my fears are true. Thanks so much!!!

Ever feel like your brain switches to zombie mode after lunch? 😴 **That 3 PM slump**... we've all been there, right? It's like the universe just collectively decided that afternoon productivity is *optional*.

So, here’s the deal: I was scrolling through our beloved internet last week, looking for a quick fix for my midday brain fog. (RIP, my endless to-do list 📝) And I stumbled upon **Box Breathing**. Yep, sounds fancy, but trust me, it's just some simple breathing stuff backed by science.

Curiosity > skepticism. 🤓 I decided to test this technique for 7 straight days to see if it could help me dodge the dreaded zombie-brain.

**Here’s the skinny on Box Breathing:**

- **Inhale for 4 seconds,** hold your breath for 4 seconds.  
- **Exhale for 4 seconds,** then hold it out for 4.  
- Repeat. (It’s basically hyper-efficient ventilation with a side of zen yoga vibes.) 🧘‍♂️

**Here’s what happened:**

1. **Day 1**: Mild impatience. 🙃 Felt like an eternity, but hey, Rome wasn’t built in a day.
2. **Day 3**: Hello, **calmer mind**! I swear, I felt a noticeable drop in my stress levels.
3. **Day 5**: That **afternoon energy drain**? Almost non-existent. My brain felt like it had a freshness pack installed.
4. **Day 7**: The habit started to stick. My focus improved, and those mini anxiety spikes? Tamed!

*Why does this work?* Apparently, it’s a cortisol hack! Box breathing combats stress responses our body throws at us like unwanted plot twists, keeping energy levels balanced.

**So, if you're:**

- Constantly hitting refresh on your brain after lunch,
- Desperate to regain even an ounce of focus in the afternoon,
- Wondering if there’s a non-coffee quick fix...

...maybe give Box Breathing a whirl? You might find yourself a bit more chill with a little ninja focus to boot. 🌟

If you have any questions, comments, requests, or feedback regarding these posts, please let me know!*

In July 1976, Terri Lynn Ray was fifteen years old. The redheaded girl was described as a free spirit who would pin inspirational notes on her bedroom wall. One of these messages, which read, ""The best things in life aren't free, but the best thing in life is freedom,"" is now etched into Terri's headstone where she is buried in her hometown of Redding, CA.

On Wednesday, July 7, 1976, Terri Lynn Ray returned home after swimming at Clear Creek in Redding with other neighborhood youths. She changed into her blue jeans and football jersey, with a bathing suit underneath, at \~5:30pm. Shortly beforehand she had talked with a friend of hers, Willie Bailey, and they had agreed to meet up at the swimming hole at 8:30pm. According to Terri's mother, Laverne, ""\[Terri\] didn't seem upset at all. She was kidding us about eating a burrito for dinner. There was nothing to me out of the ordinary."" She had told her mother that she was going to meet a friend at the swimming hole, and she was told by her mother to be home by midnight. This was the last time Laverne saw of Terri, as Laverne went out at about 6:45pm; she returned home about five hours later.

Willie Bailey told police that he decided not to go to the swimming hole that night, and that the last time he saw Terri was at the intersection of Canyon Rd and Highway 99 when they parted ways after agreeing to meet up again later. Willie's story, that he went to baseball practice and a party rather than swimming, was confirmed by alibi witnesses.

At about 7:30pm, Terri was last seen by neighborhood friends walking her dog, a shepherd mix named Charlie, away from her home at 1942 Canyon Rd toward Clear Creek. A woman familiar with the area reported driving past the creek at 7:50pm, and established that at the time ""the water was placid and there was no one in sight."" One of Terri's friends, a girl named Carla Benner, reported seeing Terri at the swimming hole at about 8pm talking with a dark-haired, balding man in his 40s. Carla said that she didn't speak with Terri at that time. Another witness, a male, went to the swimming hole at \~9:30pm looking for friends, and also reported that the water was placid and no one was present at the time.

At about 8:10pm five individuals reportedly saw Terri sitting in a medium-sized yellow car -- possibly an El Camino model pickup -- in the parking lot of the Mini Mart, 7200 North Highway 99, with two males and possibly another female, ""on the night before her body was discovered in Clear Creek."" According to one clipping, this was the ""last known sighting"" of Terri before she was killed. However, the witnesses vary in their descriptions and ""don't even agree on the model of auto. Some aren't sure if it was Terri in the car or someone who looked like her.""

When Terri's mother, Laverne, returned to her home at about 11:40pm on July 7, she noticed that Terri's dog Charlie was out of the house. Charlie appeared wet on the legs and bottom of the belly, perhaps from a swim. Also when she returned home, Laverne found a note from Terri inside, stating that some family friends had called at 7:15pm about dinner the following night. According to Laverne, ""There was something wrong with that note. It wasn't signed and Terri always signed a message. She always put 'Love ya, Terri,' or 'see you by 12,' or something."" The message was verified as accurate, ""but it wasn't finished and I had the feeling that someone else had been in the house,"" according to Laverne. A glass of orange juice had been left in an odd place on a bar, and a hand towel in the front bathroom ""was hung in a way that no one in our house hangs a towel.""

Two people, a young boy and girl, reported having visited the creek on a stroll between 11:30 and 11:45pm that night. They left and went home after hearing splashes in the water ""like someone throwing rocks."" According to a detective, ""The splashes could have been something as innocent as fish jumping.""

Terri lived with her mother Laverne, her brother Mike (10yo), and stepfather Gary McGuire. While sources conflict a bit, Terri also seems to have lived with her step-sister Lori (16yo); she also seems to have had a half-sister, Nancy Berry, who lived in San Francisco at the time. Terri's biological father had died in a traffic accident in 1972. When Terri didn't come home by midnight, her family -- Laverne, Mike, Gary, and Lori -- immediately began a search for her. One of the areas they searched was the swimming hole.

On Thursday, July 8, at 1am, two waitresses at a Denny's Restaurant at 735 Market St said they were nearly certain they saw Terri having coffee with an older man, about 40yo. One of the women said she didn't recall any apparent tension between the man and the girl. She also said that she thought it was strange that a young girl was sitting so close to an older man. However, detectives state that these sightings, ""don't tie in with anything else in the case""; same goes for Carla Benner's sighting of Terri talking to an older, balding man at the creek.

At 3am on July 8, Laverne called the Shasta County sheriff's office and reported Terri missing. Laverne said that Terri was always on time, and if she was even a few minutes late that she'd call home. Sheriff's deputies reportedly searched the area around the swimming hole (though when they did this is unclear), but found nothing.

At about noon on July 8, two youths -- Mitch Barsky (19yo) & Linda Canfield (29yo) -- were swimming near the Clear Creek Bridge when they found Terri's body floating in Clear Creek near where it flows under State Route 273 and/or near what was then Highway 99 South. Police promptly responded to the scene.

Terri was originally thought to have been stabbed five or six times, though an autopsy determined that she had been stabbed approximately fifteen (15) times with a knife blade that was about 0.75in wide, though many of the wounds were superficial, and some of them on her hands and arms may have been defensive wounds. She did not have any tissue under her fingernails, indicating that she was unable to scratch her assailant. She also had wounds on her neck, chest, and lower abdomen. Only four of the fifteen total stab wounds were mortal, one being in the neck and the other three in the chest. COD was determined to be deep stab wounds to the chest that punctured both lungs. According to one clipping, ""the differing angles of the wounds lead to 'nothing conclusive.'""

The coroner said that Terri could have been dead 16-18hrs before her body was found, though he emphasized that the estimate was difficult to make because she was in the water so long. A single spot of blood on a rock was found at the scene, though there wasn't enough blood to determine if it was hers. It is uncertain if she was killed at the site, though a couple reports note that there were no signs that she died elsewhere and was moved/dragged to the creek. An autopsy found no signs of sexual assault.

In late September 1976, an 18yo girl named Tina Lynn Crume made statements incriminating herself regarding Terri's murder while under hypnosis. However, investigators found four witnesses who put Crume elsewhere from the murder scene. After several weeks in jail, Crume was released, and murder charges were dropped on/by October 5 1976. The case quickly grew cold from there.

Terri's case was reopened in 2013 when, during their yearly review of the case, investigators realized that some evidence in police custody could now be analyzed using new DNA technology. This evidence was sent for DNA testing; as of December 2024, I have not found anything about the results of this testing. Terri is still listed among the city of Redding's victims of unsolved homicides. A $5,000 reward is available in her case.

What do you think happened to Terri? Who could have killed her and why?

The wave of sleepiness hit around 3:30–4:00 p.m. It reminded me of a weird experience I had before, so I’m wondering if anyone can help figure out the mechanism.

A few hours earlier, I had some decaf coffee. It was EA (ethyl acetate) processed decaf, which has very low caffeine. I’ve been drinking this kind of decaf regularly without issues—until now.

The fatigue I felt reminded me of when I used to drink a product called Rarebird PX coffee, which is basically decaf coffee with added paraxanthine (a metabolite of caffeine). At first, it worked great. But after a couple of weeks, I started feeling very sleepy a few hours after drinking it—so much so that I added a second cup later in the day just to stay functional. Eventually, both the morning and afternoon doses would cause me to crash an hour or two later. It felt like I was just delaying a massive sleepiness wave, not preventing it. I ended up stopping it altogether.

Now, with today’s decaf (no added paraxanthine), I felt that same kind of crashy sleepiness. So I’m wondering:
	•	Is it possible that even low-dose caffeine or paraxanthine is causing receptor-level adaptations that result in rebound fatigue?
	•	Could adenosine receptor upregulation or some kind of partial agonism be at play here?

Would love to hear from anyone who’s had similar experiences or understands the biochemistry behind this.",2,1746152013.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

I laid around for most of the day, was able to do a couple small tasks, and tried to get back to eating my usual foods regardless. I never actually got sick but my nausea did worsen after eating. I didn't notice any issues with digestion / bowel movements at this point.

Now, it's Thursday again and my digestion has been whack all week. When I eat, even smaller or comparably-sized meals than I normally would, I feel the food sitting in my stomach for much longer than it seems like it should. I wouldn't normally take note of it. My whole abdomen becomes distended for hours. It's not really painful, just uncomfortable. It's keeping me awake at night.

In terms of bowel movements, they have been very infrequent compared to what I'm used to. I'm usually regular, going once first thing in the morning after coffee and sometimes a second time in the afternoon. I've had a couple (2-3) solid bowel movements since Sunday and other times, liquid and small amounts of solids.

I'm not sure what's causing this and not necessarily looking for or expecting reddit to be able to diagnose me, but mostly looking for advice on how I should be eating to try to normalize things. I'm still hungry and want food (not when my belly is in the distended state). Sometimes the internet recommends high fiber for constipation, other places I'm reading I should stick to BRAT / easily-digestible foods for a couple of days. Should I just eat my usual diet but in smaller quantities?

Alright, friends! Picture this: you wake up, the sun is shining (or, in my case, the neighbor's super bright porch light), and you feel like a million bucks. Then suddenly, reality hits you like a cold shower. What’s the *one* thing that zaps that energy right out of you? For me, it’s the *endless* decision-making throughout the day. Seriously, why are there so many choices?!

Imagine a world where you could automate just ONE part of your routine to give yourself that extra boost! 🦸‍♂️ So, let’s ponder this together—if you could hit an ""easy"" button for your life, what would you choose? Here's what I've been thinking:

- **Meal Planning**: How awesome would it be to have every meal planned and prepped for the week? Just grab, heat, and eat. No more *What’s for dinner?* meltdowns at 5 PM! Plus, think of all the brainpower saved for more important decisions—like which Netflix show to binge next. 😂

- **Morning Routine**: What if you could fully automate your morning routine? Alarm goes off, coffee brews, and everything falls into place without you lifting a finger. Just wake up and voilà! You’re instantly in your workout gear, ready to crush the day! 🏋️‍♀️

- **Email Sorting**: Could you imagine if all your emails sorted themselves? Important ones in one folder, spam in another. It’s like having a personal assistant who knows what you need... minus the awkward small talk. 🙄

- **Reminders**: Automating reminders for self-care! Whether it’s taking a break, drinking water, or doing that yoga session you keep *promising* to do. Let your phone be your gentle nudge to take care of YOU. 

- **Finance Tracking**: What if something tracked your expenses and sent you an alert when you’re about to splurge on, I don’t know, a fifth pair of those funky socks? 🧦 Automated budgeting could save you from some serious “oops” moments!

The real question here is: **Why aren’t we doing this?** Are we afraid of losing control? Or just too attached to the chaos of daily life? *Is the struggle genuinely real, or have we just become accustomed to it?* 

Anyways, I’d love to hear your thoughts! What would you automate? Let’s dream big together! 🌟 And who knows, maybe we’ll inspire someone to bring that automation to life—because hey, we all deserve a little more ease and a lot more peace!",1,1746151580.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

No matter how rough you make yourself seem

It shone through like sunlight through the leaves

There is kindness hidden in your steps

A burst of joy

A squeak of a laugh as you turn the corner

No matter how hard you drag your feet

No matter how small you make yourself seem

It shines through

The cage of your own creation

It smells like sunscreen and sand

Like ocean waves and empty Coke bottles

Like old car air fresheners and burnt-out cigarettes

Like ink and smudged shoes

That night, you fell asleep on the couch

After about 15 seconds, the driver behind me pulls into the left turn lane, then swerves back in front of me. I beeped the horn, partially because they almost side swiped me and partially to say 'WTF?'. I wish I hadn't now though. We didn't have any prior interaction! They were behind me for maybe a full minute, and most of that was spent waiting at the previous red light. I turned the first chance I got to get away from them.

No packing up the kids, no long drives, no cooking or managing the chaos of a big family event. Just a quiet morning with my own family, maybe a farmers market visit, coffee while it’s still hot, and not having to be “on” all day. I’m an introvert, so big family events can be so draining to me anyway 

So my sister and I already made plans to celebrate with our mom on that Saturday. We’re doing lunch together, maybe some shopping, just us and no kids. It felt like a great plan - Saturday is for celebrating with our mom, and Sunday can be for us as moms.

But then my mom called and said the whole extended family is now getting together Sunday morning for church, then cooking brunch at my grandma’s house. And she did say she’d understand if I didn’t come (which I appreciate), but there was definitely a tiny tone of guilt, and I know if I skip it, I’ll hear about it later from my grandma and aunt.

But I really don’t want to spend Sunday driving an hour each way, helping cook, and managing little kids around a house with no toys. I just want to stay home and rest.

So…AITA for saying no to the big family brunch so I can actually enjoy Mother’s Day in a way that feels good to me?",2,1746150660.0,AITAH,17,0.67,False

Hey all — I recently launched a low-budget guerrilla campaign in NYC called Shot of Levity and would love your feedback.

Here is the campaign page: https://www.offtheclock.agency/shot-of-levity

It’s the first activation from my new experiential agency, Off the Clock — we create subtle, joyful interventions in everyday life, using humor and curiosity to help people reset, reconnect, and show up better in work and life.

The Idea:
We wrapped 5,000 coffee cups across 3 NYC cafés with limited-edition sleeves featuring workplace humor from viral accounts like @DisappointingAffirmations, @HumorousResources and @WorkRetireDie. The goal: offer commuters a moment of levity before work stress kicks in — and quietly introduce the brand.

Why It Matters:
Instead of interrupting people with ads, we tried to enhance a daily ritual — your morning coffee — with a bit of unexpected humor. Each sleeve included a QR code linking to a playful campaign page.

What I’d Love Feedback On:
	•	Thoughts on the creative concept and execution?
	•	How would you approach virality or PR amplification?
	•	Would you consider this a strong first launch for an agency?

Thanks in advance — open to all feedback, including tough love.

I don't know why they don't seem comfortable talking about relationships. I've been dwelling on this recently and it really frustrates me. Is it because they think guys can't be trusted hearing about other guys? Is it because girls don't normally talk to other guys about relationships?

Okey this happened in the end of 2022/early 2023, I'm currently 18f, for some context my mom and my dad are separated, they have my older sister and 4 years later they have me but for this time my mom hate him (he was/is a alcoholic) and was a really toxic relationship for some reason they continue a couple of years till my mom finally kick him out of the house. 
I was for the best really and my sister and I continue to see our dad and I can said he love us very much, but I think this touch something in my sister head, the separation and my existence of course, because she was the first grandchild of bout families, my mom and dad are the older child from their families, and she was incredibly spoiled because of that, till I born and ""robbed"" the attention. 
She and I grow up fight very much, verbally and physically, she never forgive me for born, but we started get along when our mom started dating to our stepfather, he was good in the beginning I accept that I was considering see him like a dad, but then he became a alcoholic like my dad but him and my mom are together till this day. We both hated him, he has never been physically abuse of any kind to my mom or us, but yes verbally and is EXTREMELY controlling and when he is drunk the house is uncomfortable, fights, smell of the alcohol or vomit, just see him pass out in the couch, is horrible.
He and my mom married and have our little brother in 2014, he is the only good thing of that relationship, and my sister and I love him, but I really hate the family and father he has, he love his father, and believes everything he said (not a good thing because he is a extremely religious person, I am bisexual and my uncle, brother of my mom, gay, also he teaches him that the evolution is a lie, and more things but is not important) but my brother literally grew up seeing his dad drunk and his mom crying. 
My sister became a extremely weird person, she has this necessity to always be the center of everything, she really try to be a influencer, and always lied to everyone about things just to have attention, if you are in a discussion with her and she is losing she are going to yelling, literally yelling crazy and trying to scratch you with her long nails, she is a petite-otaku-vegetarian-crazy person. 
She always said that our mom doesn't love her because she don't buy vegetarian meat and more things for her, I don't know in other countries but in mine vegetarian meat is VERY expensive, my mom is a teacher and here paid very little to teachers, father is a chef but almost always is unemployed, stepfather has a little store, so we really don't have much money, my mom is currently still paying the house we live, so yes she always was a little crazy self-center person. 
I was worst when she started to being obsessed with criminals TV shows (CSI, Criminals Minds, etc) and it was always listening to podcasts or YouTube videos about true crimes cases and when she graduated for college started studying criminology I remember perfectly one time that she told me that they not just teach to how cach criminals, also teach how do the ""perfect crime"". She in the las years of college started dating, her boyfriend became a really good friend of mine but was obsessed with her that increase her ego even more, one time our coffee machine broke so our mom made coffee in a traditional way, put hot water in the coffe with filter paper, literally the same that does the machine, it was coffe, but no, she was not drinking that coffe, she made her boyfriend came to our house with a termo with coffe from a machine. 
In any discussion that they have she shut up him, she always need to have the reason and him literally just gave her all the things she wanted, if i said something and he agreed to me but my sister no he literally tell her that was sorry and then said that he changed opinion, again, it was creppy. 
In 2021/2022 she and I became best friends, thanks to Covid, we was always together, she have a boyfriend but cero friends, I have literally one friend and her, so for me was my best friend, but for November my stepfather was drunk, it was a huge deal and a very horrible time, but happened something, he was really, really sick, he vomited, and vomited, more that normal, almost d1ed. 
He don't d1e, in January was fine, my mom already forgive him, and everything, in a close ""city"" ""place"" I don't know how explaining doesn't matters, there were some celebrations that take place every year, our father, one of his sister and our paternal grandmother takes us to visit that celebrations, in the night we slept in my father house with them, but the next day my sister went there again but with her boyfriend. The next thing I know is that my mother is texting me tell me that my sister is in a psychiatric center, in a game she loses all her university money and she call my mom for more, then loses all that money too, she has a psychotic attack and the police don't know what to do with that thing so they leve her in the psychiatric, the boyfriend calls my mom, so she go there. 
There they do a exam in my sister and a interrogation, she tells huge lies, for example that we were physically abuse or that I try to unal1ve myself (spoiler later thanks to her I do star thinking that) but the most important thing is that she confess that she put cockroach poison in my stepfather beer and put a combination of pills that she maid dust on the container were was the lemon juice that my mom and I drink. I do remember that I grip the container because I want a drink and she look at me and said ""Are your sure? It taste bad"" I really don't give much attention and drink any way I FRONT OF HER and it taste weird, but in the moment just I think it was the refrigerator that gave that taste. 
When my mom read all the things she said a and do in the document when they let her out (YES THEY HEAR ALL THAT SHE DONE AND LET HER OUT THE SAME DAY, LIKE LITERALLY JUST CONFESSED TO TRY TO UN AL1VE THREE PEOPLE, INCLUDING HER MOM AND SISTER!????) she almost pass out, I don't know how they make it to the house, but the next day my grandma took me to the house and I talk to my mom, she obviously is a disaster, the she and my stepfather go I don't remember where o why, but I was alone with her. 
I was in a huge shock, but try to talk to her, she was acting so arrogant, I never going to forget how she see me in the eyes and said ""I do nothing wrong"", she was close to me then she go to her room, she is really, really small, i am like a head and half more tall than her and much more strong, we bot get bullied in school but when she just internalise all than pain I was fighting verbally and physically with everybody, if she don't go and keep tell me things I was really thinking about to b3at her I sincerely wish that would happened for all that happen later. 
My paternal grandmother come and try to speak with her, we all sit in the living room, except for my stepfather, and talk she just repeat thar she do nothing wrong and laughing, she was LAUGHING, my grandmother tells her what about her boyfriend and career she just said that her boyfriend would never leave her, I sincerely think that if he try she would un al1ve him. 
That night i slept in my fathers house again he was also in a huge shock, the next day my sister was gone, she run out of the house because OBVIOUSLY my mom was trying to get her moving in to my father's place. In the present she said that my mother kicked her out, she end it in a apartment that was paid for my maternal grandmother, she was in her side, she was defending her and tell us that she was no trying to un al1ve us she just wanna that us ""calm down"". 
Then she sue my mom for child support, here if a child is not living with the Adult legally responsible for them that adult must paid child support till they have 22 years, or if the child no longer keep studying or they moving it with a partner, so we start with a legal battle, but again, with have no much money, no juts I started thinking about ended up and just give up, my mother too. In the end she lose and star paying child support every month to her, that put us in a hard time economically.
My mom packed all her things and her Boyfriends come for them, and my maternal grandma started to tell me that a was being a bad sister because I don't wanna talk to her. 
She ended up living in my grandma house, my mother started to forgive her and let my little brother go with her, him seems to love her for some reason, she don't talk to much to my mom, she keep saying that my mom is horrible bla, bla, but my mom really wanna have a relationship with her. 

She is a totall crazy sh1t person, and I really, really hated her, I wanna insult her more but the insults in English are boring with no much meaning. In the present she is living with her husband, yes they married, my mom id not pay child support anymore, but is not fair, everybody forgive her, my brother love go to her place, my aunt, sister of my mom, is close to her, she is the mom of my cousin he has my same age and with are very close but she always see me weird, my grandma loves her, she work, keep studying, my mom trying to talk to her, went to the wedding, everybody does what she want, she love eat chess but that gave her strong digestive problems, literally her sh1t is like a rock, when she was living with my granma the toilet was not capable of ""suck off"" that rock, and she just leves my grandma go every time with a stick to turn the rock in to small peaces so the toilet will work. 

It's not fair that she literally have cero consequences, everybody loves her, my maternal grandfather have money but he lives far away with the woman that he leaves my grandma for, he takes my sister to vacations, and every loves her, she literally have a TikTok (but have like 5 followers) when she talks about how she ran away from a toxic family and mother, she talks like she was a poor victim, a angel that was being abused, obviously she not talk about de abuse of she to me (she loves making me bullying for my body, and in my birthdays always try to make me feel miserable) and don't talk about all the trying to un al1ve my family things, in her wedding, I don't go but I see pictures, she was in a princess dress with a tiara,  and when she was starting to work she post a Instagram history with a picture of her and a text that said ""Is so hard this work, it's like putting Paris Hilton to work"". 

I wish I just could forget that she is my sister, that I have a older sister in general, that when for year a complete focused to be there to my mom and playing, caring and everything to my little brother, they no just love and prefer her, my mother really try to have a relationship and my brother loves to be with, play and be in her place, is obviously that she is her favorite sister. But is no just that, my mother always is telling me that a I am a ""close mind"" because I don't forgive, I don't want a relationship with her and I literally don't talk to my stepfather, we live together but I act like him don't exists, I love my maternal grandmother, but she keeps telling me that I am the bad sister because I don't want to talk to her, even been near her, she is telling me that we are always gonna be blood connect (I feel sick for that), that I am a bad person, I'm gonna go to hell (I'm gonna see her and my stepfather there so I want to be happy without them in this live) etc, my maternal grandfather is also telling me that I'm gonna forgive her I a point of my life, and that a I need to talk to her and stop being a bad sister, my aunt thinks that I am the weird and toxic one (I have a boyfriend) etc, it's 2025 and I'm still being call the bad sister and she is in a happy live with no consequences.

I'm 26, gay, a woman, and never been in a long term relationship. I'm an only child, and have never been interested in dating until i was in college. I love my independence, and I know myself so well. 

Moved to NYC, and I went to a LAC on the east coast... I have a few friends here, but they've all flocked to LA after I've been here for 6 months. Gorgeous timing ladies. Anyways, this summer I did a hinge date binge for a week, and on my 3rd first date, this persistent, intelligent, beautiful bi girl and I start seeing each other. She's such a smarty, so sweet, a true lover, and getting her masters in the fall. We have such a sweet month together. My past of overthinking was behind me.

We have a date one day, and we talk about why past relationships were not working, timing and circumstances of it, my depression and how she can show up (corny asf but sweet), and lost friendships. She's heady, and a ruminator. 

She goes on a trip the next day with her friends, and she texts me: She thinks i'm so sweet and so cool, but she's not in the headspace to date consistently, but thinks she wants to be friends. I ask if she wants to talk in person, and what being friends would ""mean"" moving forward, and she says she needs time, and just can't see me as a friend right now.

I know the damn drill on this, but I always take them as face value. And frankly I would love to be friends, she's a wonderful person, and the people I've known around me have left. Connection is so special.

I test the waters with a couple light texts over the next few months, but I get an icy feeling. I ask her to coffee, and she says shes busy. Then I tell her hey, I'm open to being friends like you said, but what gives? And she says: after much thought, she would ultimately be a bad friend to me. I heart her message.

  
I reactivate my instagram last week, and she's seeing a semester exchange dude from her masters program. I'm droopy and really sad about it. I'm thankful I could feel that way about someone.

1kcper9,https://i.redd.it/sehm18qdw9ye1.jpeg,Anyone have a link for this “From Rejected Mate to Pack Sovereign: A Luna’s Triumph”?,"I was seven months pregnant, in the middle of negotiating a territorial agreement with a neighboring pack, when my mate, Zachary Henderson, the Alpha of the Henderson Pack, swaggered in with Monroe Porter, his Delta, blatantly parading her around. This was his eighth affair and the fourth time he’d sabotaged my work as Beta.

Jabbing a finger at me, he scoffed, ""You're so devious; why did I ever mate with someone like you?""

Monroe chimed in with a smug, mocking grin, ""Why's a pregnant Luna like you out having coffee with others, ma'am?""

Kyle Walker, the Gamma from the Mirabelle Pack and my client, visibly upset by Zachary’s accusations, stood up for me, only to be harshly cut off. ""I always suspected you two were up to something!"" Zachary barked, his alpha tone reverberating through the room.

I chose not to dignify him with a response and decided to sever our mate bond, which sent his entire family into a panic.

---

""Luna Lillie, with your skills and experience, it’s unfortunate you’re still just the Beta of the Henderson Pack,"" Kyle said, grinning as he raised his wine glass to me. ""If you ever think about joining us at the Mirabelle Pack, even while expecting, the Beta position is yours…""

He left the thought hanging, nodding meaningfully.

I clinked my glass in response, ""I’ll think about it. But let’s keep our minds on business, Gamma Kyle. How about we review today’s agreement?""

I had been working on this territorial deal since before I got pregnant. Signing it would mean I could finally take my maternity leave and handle the chaos at home. We were deep into the details when the conference room door swung open.

""Let’s see who’s challenging us. This is the Alpha of the Henderson Pack, after all. Can’t our Alpha afford a private room?"" The voice was haughty, belonging to Monroe Porter, a Delta in our pack. She was dressed provocatively, with an air of flashy glamour.

Next to her was my supposedly-on-a-diplomatic-mission mate, Zachary Henderson. He was clearly inebriated—his normally commanding presence was diminished, his face flushed, and he staggered slightly, holding Monroe’s waist tightly.

Seeing me there, Zachary’s first reaction wasn’t guilt but anger.

""Lillie Olson, what are you doing here?""

I gently rubbed my belly, soothing a subtle ache inside. After all these years, I should have been used to his betrayals and learned to manage my emotions. Navigating the pack’s affairs had taught me composure. I simply smiled.

""Just business,"" I replied.

Zachary’s antics were no secret in the Henderson Pack; it was all about keeping up appearances. Goddess knows how many pack members laughed at me behind my back. At the last pack meeting, Zachary had come up with some excuse to gift Monroe several limited edition designer bags using pack funds. I pretended not to notice at first, but when it became a big issue, I confronted him. He swore it would never happen again, insisting those women meant nothing. I didn’t mention severing our bond because there were still things I needed to resolve, and I was willing to give him one last chance.

But now, seeing the concerned look Gamma Kyle gave toward my belly, I knew it was time to end this.

Perhaps sensing my resolve, Zachary abruptly released Monroe and reached out to me, a fleeting look of shock and fear crossing his face.

""Lillie, let me explain,"" he said.

I gently pulled away before I could respond, only to have Zachary’s anger flare up again, his eyes filled with frustration.

""Why are you so difficult?""

I turned to Gamma Kyle with a smile, ""Excuse me.""

My calm demeanor only stoked Zachary’s anger further, making him babble recklessly.

""You’re a pregnant Luna making a spectacle of yourself. Who knows what you and he are really doing under the guise of work? After all these years of mating, you still haven’t given me a son. You even made me terminate the one child I had. You’re a heartless viper!""

Gamma Kyle, unable to hold back any longer, spoke up for me. ""Alpha Zachary, such accusations are uncalled for…""

But Zachary cut him off, sneering coldly.

Egged on by his disdain, Monroe chimed in, standing defiantly, ""Who do you think you are? How dare you interrupt our Alpha?""

Taken aback, Gamma Kyle froze, possibly never having witnessed such a dramatic scene before.

Seeing Gamma Kyle’s pause, Monroe grew bolder, taunting me with more venom. ""Luna Lillie, a mate should know her place. If I hadn’t tipped Alpha Zachary off, we wouldn’t have caught you with your lover, right?""

Zachary believed her instantly, casting a look of loathing my way. ""I always knew you were like this. I should never have…""

Gamma Kyle, having had enough of the absurdity, finally snapped, ""Alpha Zachary, have you lost your mind? Are you seriously unaware of the long-standing territorial agreement between the Henderson Pack and the Mirabelle Pack? The contract is right here! Your mate is visibly pregnant, and you buy into any nonsense thrown at you? How about you hand over your brain while you’re at it?""

The Mirabelle Pack was a powerful neighboring pack, and before returning here, Gamma Kyle had been involved in some rather risky diplomatic missions, living life on the edge. He had guts.

I gently patted Gamma Kyle’s shoulder, signaling for him to calm down, and slowly began to gather the contracts from the table, moving toward Zachary and Monroe.

Monroe, watching me approach, wavered, her bravado diminishing. ""What are you doing? Are you going to hit me because I spoke the truth?""

Ignoring her bravado, I looked coldly at Zachary.

Under my steady gaze, his drunken flush gradually faded.

Was Monroe still asking those questions?

""The truth isn’t the issue here,"" I said, rolling up my sleeves. ""The matter at hand is that you owe Gamma Kyle an apology!""",1,1746149976.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

My husband and I are great friends, I mean this in the best of ways he is my best friend and I am his however he’s not a good partner (I think I am but obviously that’s subjective). Ideally of course I wanna be with him but sometimes I don’t know if I can. I’m a stay at home mom obviously and he thinks he’s not as bad as some of these men that force their wives to do everything but he kind of is. We started having a bit of gnat problem the past couple of days and today he got home while I was out with the kids. I had some exciting things to tell him and honestly was just happy he was home as he just got a new position where he gets out earlier than before. Well I was greeted by him smoking a cigar on the porch and he went off on me (calmly but still talking to me like I’m a child) about certain things that he thinks I did to cause the gnats and how I need to do better etc. I took responsibility for my part and said I may need a reminder because my thoughts are constantly racing from one thing to another. The conversation somehow went to me needing to be more organized and I brought I wanna use some of my money to hire someone because cleaning isn’t my strong suit and he somehow thinks that won’t help and how I keep saying I need help but I really just need to be more organized. I went inside with the kids and the more I kept thinking the more upset I got. Yesterday he got out early and didn’t even think to call me he drove straight to the cigar shop then called me when he was close by to ask me to make coffee. I honestly was a little bothered but not as much as I am today. He gets to do things and doesn’t even think to check in and see if he can help with things like the kids which should be our responsibility. He never puts away his laundry so I’ve just started leaving it in the hamper, he doesn’t wash his own dishes which is our agreement because he refuses to wash dishes cause he hates it but I refuse to be the only one doing (though I am because he doesn’t fulfill his end of the deal). He only cleans when the mess bothers him and he asks annoying questions like “why is this here” the entire time which makes it so o where I don’t wanna be there. He leaves his clothes on the couch along with his blanket pretty much every day. He doesn’t clean his hair when he shaves. He doesn’t help with the baby at night anymore because when I’d leave him with him he’s let him cry and I’d end up waking up anyway so it made no sense cause I still didn’t get any rest: he has no idea what medicines the kids are on he doesn’t do groceries.. I could go on and on. And the thing is I’ve stopped letting it bother me and told myself I’ll just do the best I can and be content with it, until today. When I came inside I took a notebook and started writing everything I do with time stamps as well as what he does and I’m going to give him a log and letter on Mother’s Day, which is when I’m supposed to go away for the night. I don’t expect it to go well but idk what else to do other than leave him. I don’t wanna be with an entitled brat of a child who I have to remind to do things and then still end up doing them myself. But again I don’t wanna necessarily break up my marriage either, I just feel entirely unappreciated and taken advantage of. 

Idk what my point is maybe advice from anyone who has successfully re-educated their child.. I mean partner. Or idk I just know this isn’t the life I want ",1,1746149857.0,stayathomemoms,2,1.0,False

I wasn’t sure how this week was going to go. I thought maybe I’d give myself permission to have one or two beers or cocktails. (Ha! One. Yeah, right. 🙄)


I’ve realized that part of what I miss about drinking is the ritualistic part of the experience at social events. I think of my daily coffee (ok, coffees, plural) as an enjoyable ritual I enjoy every morning. Somedays the smell of the brewed coffee is what gets me outta bed. 


The longer I’m away from alcohol, the more I find myself missing the experience of drinking, being part of a group, who can just have one or two drinks at dinner and call it good. Drinking was something I enjoyed. Well, I enjoyed the first one.

But I now appreciate being able to drive safely all the time. I really like not having any signs of a hangover in the mornings. It’s nice being able to make clear-headed decisions and remember everything from the night before. It’s a relief not thinking about my next drink all. damn. day.

I'm a male.  A widower.  It feels like I have gone to great lengths to show that I only want a friendship with them.  By great lengths, I mean telling them they are a friend, never initiating any hugs or physical contact, and being respectful of boundaries in conversation.  

I genuinely only want a friendship.  I do desire the companionship from women, but not romance.  I had a romance and it can't be replaced.  

However, it seems like these women friends completely avoid opening up or even mentioning anything about guys they are seeing.  They have never said anything about their relationships with men.  It feels like it subtracts from the trust and fullness of our friendship.

A couple examples:

(1) Girlfriend #1.  I've known her since 2023.  She will invite me out to lunches with her girlfriends.  At lunches, they seem to have a curated set of topics they talk about, but never their relationships with guys.  I feel like they almost use codes when it comes to boys.  When we get coffee she will talk about everything-- travel, work, family, friends-- but never the guys she is seeing.  She has a serious boyfriend but never even said she was dating anyone.

(2) Girlfriend #2.  I've known her since 2021.  She got married a year or so ago.  I really wanted to be invited her wedding, but never was.  She invited girlfriends that had done a whole lot less for her than I had.  Afterwards, when I asked her how the wedding was, she wouldn't even talk about it.  

  
I don't know why they don't seem comfortable talking about relationships.  I've been dwelling on this recently and it really frustrates me.  Is it because they think guys can't be trusted hearing about other guys?  Is it because girls don't normally talk to other guys about relationships?  Is it because they doubt that men can be truly just friends with women?  Or doubt my intentions?

Some days you win, some days you lose. Subscriptions = **steady cash** without the stress

Here’s how:

# ① Start Small, Think Big (Like Video Game Levels)

**Level 1:** “**Coffee Pass**” ($25/month)

* They pay once → get drip coffee every day.
* *Why it works:*
   * They come back like clockwork (free coffee = happy brain).
   * Buy snacks 40% of the time → cha-ching! 🥐

**Level 2:** “**Breakfast Club**” ($80/month)

* Coffee + breakfast sandwich daily.
* *Why it works:*
   * They prepay → you know exactly how much bacon to cook.
   * Bring coworkers → free marketing! 👯♀️

**Level 3:** “**Fancy Pants Club**” ($150/month)\*\*

* Monthly coffee tasting + free bag of beans.
* *Why it works:*
   * People LOVE feeling special (Instagram bragging rights).
   * Costs you 12→profit=12→*profit*=138. 🤑

# ② Trick Their Brains (But in a Nice Way)

* **Free trial:** “First week FREE → cancel anytime!” *(Works because nobody cancels after tasting free coffee, as long as your coffee is good)*
* **Bring a friend:** “Get a free month if your coworker joins!” *(Friends = more money. Duh.)*
* **Secret menu:** “Subscribers only get unicorn lattes on Fridays.” 🦄 *(FOMO = $$$.)*

# ③ Keep Your Baristas Happy (Or They’ll Revolt)

* **Tip jar 2.0:** Add $5-10/month “barista bonus” to every subscription. *(Staff smiles = better service = more subscribers.)*
* **VIP lane:** Subscribers skip lines → others get jealous. *(Jealousy = new sign-ups.)*

# ④ Do This Right Now (Takes 10 Minutes)

1. Grab [**HoneySub**](https://honeysub.com/r) (Free if we don't manage to get you subscribers).
2. Make a “Coffee Pass” plan.
3. Print a sign: “**Join → Free Coffee for a Week!**”
4. Test for 1-4 weeks
5. Change something about the name/price/promotion every month until you find what clicks.
6. Train staff to baristas to always ask.

**TL;DR:** Subscriptions = customers pay you monthly to keep coming back. Start small, make it fun, profit while you sleep.

1kcp8ar,https://www.reddit.com/r/winstonsalem/comments/1kcp8ar/i_just_want_to_say_that_ive_enjoyed_every_day/,I just want to say that I've enjoyed every day that I've spent in Winston Salem.,"Some background. I'm a North Carolina native, I grew up in Washington along the Pamlico in Beaufort County and I currently live in Concord just outside of Charlotte. Winston Salem is a city in this state I've always known about but until late last year I never properly visited it. The only time I had been to WS was in 2015 when my hometown's High School football team the Pam Pack made it to the state championship and played at Wake Forest's football stadium, they proceeded to get their asses kicked miserably.

Outside of that and knowing it for Wake Forest, Winston Salem was just never really on my radar because I just never looked into it. That was until I saw a YouTuber named Citynerd making a video visiting WS. In the video he pretty much just vlogs his experience in Winston and showcases some of the city's landmarks and attractions.

My first real visit to Winston Salem was a random day in December of 2024. I'd had a long, shitty week at work and wanted to blow off steam by leaving town for a bit and going to another city in NC for the day, I was thinking Greensboro but ultimately decided against it as I was struggling to come up with things to do that I hadn't already done. That left me with Winston Salem and to say I made the right call would be an understatement. 

It started with me just exploring downtown and just by walking I quickly grew to like WS, it was a very walkable environment and there were a lot of stores catching my interest. It was really cold that day however and I wanted some coffee, I went to Bitty and Beau's which, I'm aware isn't unquie to WS as there's one in CLT's South End, but I still really liked it, that coffee was just what I needed and the inside of the store had some really nice displays. From there I walked towards the West End of downtown and noticed an alley out the corner of my eye, I walked into it and noticed the artwork on the walls leading into a bookstore, bookmarks specifically, which was a really nice store might I add. From there I continued onto the West End because I wanted to see the Dash's ballpark and I really liked it. I have a thing where I just like going to sports venues in an area if there are any and the Dash's ballpark was awesome to see, I really liked it. From there I kept working west and ended up at a store called Retroid Games. I'm not really a collector of video games anymore but if I was, I would've been over the moon, I liked the layout and organization of that store more than anything. From there I worked my way back into downtown proper and discovered that WS has a Mast General Store, if I didn't love WS by that point, that discovery sealed it. Idk how WS locals feel about the Mast General Store, and to some it may seem like just a store, but I have really fond memories of going to the one in Boone as a Kid and Teenager so to me the Mast General Store may as well be the greatest place on earth, I seriously love that place no matter which location and I make it a priority to go every time. My time in downtown came to an end around this point as I had to leave to go to Hippo Records before it closed. Hippo Records WS (and by extension the Greensboro location) are some of my favorite record stores in this entire state. The variety is there, the prices are really competitive with my area of NC and in some cases beat my area, and the shop owner is pleasant to be around. Afterwards I hit McKay's since it was across the street just to check it out, it was okay, I like how big the store is and their book selection is jaw dropping, but even at that time the place was a bit crowded for my tastes so I decided to call it a night there.

My 2nd time in WS I was with a friend showing him around the city, I pretty much took him to the same places on my first visit but this time we took the Strollway into Old Salem. Before I comment on Old Salem, outside of the noise you hear going over the 421 freeway, the Strollway is one of my favorite urban trails in this state, its layout is superb if you ask me and if I ever lived in WS I could see myself walking/biking very frequently. As for Old Salem, it's fine, just not really my thing. I do love how they've preserved it I guess, and I would recommend anyone visit it to 1. Take the the Strollway and 2. For the novelty factor more than anything. However I think it's fair to say that if I'm visiting WS solo that I'm probably not gonna visit Old Salem again. After we had our full of Old Salem we worked our way back into Downtown and ate at this place called Camel City BBQ. Now, I'm not gonna make some bold claim that this is the best BBQ I've had in this state (that would be Buxton Hall in Asheville, R.I.P), hell I'm not even confident that it's the best BBQ WS has to offer. But for the location, the adaptive reuse, the portion size relative to how much I paid, and me being a BBQ fiend, I was more than satisfied with it. Afterwards we went to Hippo/McKay's and then headed home as we had pretty done all we had set out to do.

As for my 3rd trip to WS, I don't really have much to say that I haven't already said. I popped by after visiting Greensboro for some anime market since WS is only 30 minutes from Greensboro. I visited the same places as usual but this time I explored the arts district North of downtown and just popped into all the stores randomly, that was really fun. After that and a bite to eat at Camel City BBQ again, I went and walked the Long Branch Trail. I honestly don't know if I like that or the Strollway more but they are equally some of my favorite urban trails in this state, I just wish the longbranch trail was maybe a bit longer because of how much I loved being on it. In typical me fashion, I ended the day by hitting up Hippo in WS and headed home. No McKay's this time simply because I wasn't really in the mood and had already spent a lot of money that day.

Idk if anyone here will find this interesting but I really just wanted to share how much I've enjoyed the time that I've spent in Winston Salem, as its quickly become one of my favorite cities in this state and there's still more for me to check out that I haven't seen yet. I look forward to the next time I visit Winston Salem, whenever they may be.",34,1746149412.0,winstonsalem,5,0.97,False

We're going to go to Vermont and have 1 coffee, then we'll go to Louisiana and have 1 donut, after that we'll go to Nebraska and have one hot dog, next we go to Connecticut, then to Hawaii to have 2 cups of coffee. Where are we? 

A: Denver 

Here's another way to spell out Denver

We're going to start in Baltimore, then we'll go to Rhode Island, then we'll go to New Jersey and have 4 beers, then we'll go to Connecticut and have 4 hotdogs, then we'll go to Sacramento. 

Here's a different city

We're going to start in Minnesota, have 3 maithais in Texas and then go to Sacramento. Where are we? 

A: New York

My issue is I am completely unable to crack this cipher, I can provide some other examples as well as theories I have worked on.

1kcp7cv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kcp7cv,"[Discussion] killed pmc attacking Kaban, kaban friend now?","So ill start with the question, does killing a pmc attacking a boss allow you to now walk freely in their POV? I have 5.0 scav rep and didnt realize i killed him but for future reference yk. Thanks for the info!!

Dont have to read but its part of the raid the question is referencing
And now a quick story, scavving streets for my first raid after work, saw a timmy push kaban and i was gonna rat him out. Turns out it was a 3 man. One died to Basmach (the carry i assume) and the other two i killed. The first one i killed was a random nade i threw that some how killed him, i didnt realize i killed him until after the raid as i never pushed in the camp (the carry says i have curve grenade hacks) the last guy pushed around the alley way near car and was killing scavs and i ratted him and killed him which the carry claims i tracked him across the map (mind you i was in the little coffee shop outside kabans camp near car the entire time) and proceeds to call me names and stuff which i thought was funny and claims me having his dogtag is sus too because his friend had it in his back pack. 

So anyways i wanted to share this because i have no friends and i dont stream till weekends but i thought it was funny. Thanks!!",2,1746149329.0,EscapefromTarkov,2,1.0,False

This is my first colonoscopy. I know I am lucky to have picoprep instead of the big prep, but I still find it very difficult to drink the solution. 

Since forever, I have difficulty drinking things. I don’t drink coffee, tea, I can’t drink at lot of water at once. 

The taste is awful. It was super hard not to gag on it. I drank it multiple times with water in between, rinsed my mouth, took a gum, etc.

I have to take my second one at 3:30 am. I don’t know how I am going to do it. I already have liquid poop, but it is not all clear.

Any advice ? What happens if I can’t finish it ? 
I know there is a chance they cancel it, but I won’t do it again if that’s what happens

1kcp4mf,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/comments/1kcp4mf/would_love_some_outside_counsel_please/,Would love some outside counsel please!,"Ok, so I’ve got something that’s driving me a bit nuts & I know what I need to do, but would also like to hear it from you lovely folks as well.

Back story, I bought a house about 5 years ago; I’m a big fan of breakfast spots so I would try a few out every weekend until I found one close by that would be my go to spot that I’ll pretty much go to every Saturday morning to enjoy some coffee & a simple breakfast that I’m not making.  My little personal weekly treat to myself lol.

Over time I obviously get to know the staff and I meet this waitress who’s only a couple of years younger than me, for the sake of the story we’ll call her Jamie.  She’s always super nice and will chat me up and occasionally sit with me while I enjoy breakfast in-between her running around.  I never really thought anything of it and just assumed it was her being personable and the fact that I am a regular so it all just kind of made sense.  Always considered it innocent chatting.

A little bit ago, I found out that Jamie collects post cards.  I travel for work, so over the past few work visits I’ve snagged a few for her and brought them back for her, just as something nice.  I’ve never exchanged phone numbers or anything like that because I never got the vibe from her, and mostly assumed I’m more of a friend zone type, which is cool.  I just enjoy the conversations, and enjoyed doing something small for folks who take care of me at the restaurant.

This past weekend we were talking about favorite foods & Jamies nationality makes something I absolutely love and it’s hard to come by.  She mentions that she can make it for me one day and I was obviously super excited.  We exchange numbers so I can pick it up one day.  About a week or so later she texts me & says she made it and offered to drop it off at my house.  I kindly oblige.  She comes over & stays for a couple hours, we have a few drinks, I enjoy her company & food she made for me.  Nothing sexual happens besides some innocent flirting or at least so I thought lol.  Our personalities just kind of vibe with each other.

During this visit she mentions that she lives with her BF and turns out they’ve been together for a long while.  Not married.  I’m somewhat surprised by this, but just played it off and continued with our conversation and drinks, and then she hugged me and went on her way a little later.

Now I’m sitting here with some serious mixed messages….I potentially had thought Jamie had liked me, because who goes out of their way to make homemade food & drop it off and hang out for a couple hours, but then also mention their BF along the way??

My question is, how would you all pursue this?  Do I just come out and say I’m interested in her, which I am, & risk being a home wrecker & lose a cool person to chat with on the weekends; or just leave sleeping dogs lie since she did mention she lives with her bf and bury that comment and continue business as usual and enjoy my Saturday breakfasts.  Man I’m torn…also sorry for the rant, but I needed to get this off my chest bc I’ve been thinking of her quite a bit after that visit.",1,1746149089.0,datingadvice,1,1.0,False

Long time lurker here and i follow all the rules. I set my expectations clearly that i cant meet more than 2-3 times a month, offer mid $xxx allowance and happy to go out for dinner/drinks.

First meet as m&g only, i do offer small gift to cover gas costs or order uber for m&g but just havent had any luck.

Last few tries - 
1) Catfished twice,i dont argue if pics dont match, just have a drink and pay the bill and leave.
2) one m&g went really well, spent 3 hours and met next day for fun meet. Met for drinks and dinner, then went to a hotel, didn't see any red flags (maybe asked for money upfront is a red flag but first meet i figured she might be worried i would scam her so gave it), an hour or so after we checked in she said go take a shower and i will join you in a min, few mins in she left while saying i cant do this. 

3) scheduled a m&g for coffee, went to starbucks close to her and she gets in car and asks if i can drop her 15 miles away. I told her no and starts begging for $20

4) Countless interactions with ""SB's"" on SA but as soon as i mention m&g they stop replying.

5) Had one short term arrangement (i def think she was on drugs as she was a medical assistant), m&g went well, we had two fun meets after that and third time we were suppsed to meet she starts texting me screenshots of her conversation with her boss, kept sending ""you deserve someone better"" and asks me to come to her place (she made it clear before that that she cant host), and when i said maybe from next time she says she cant do this. 
6) Lot of scam profiles/phone number collectors, as soon as you share phone number they stop replying.

Its just frustating, Any thoughts on what i could be doing differently?

1kcp0mf,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1kcp0mf/what_is_going_on/,What is going on?,"Okay, so recently I have experienced some jaw pain as of yesterday that wasn’t too bad, just kind of uncomfortable. At first I thought I had fallen asleep with my jaw open for a long period of time (my roommate (ish) came into my room yesterday morning and saw me knocked out and my mouth was open), but I figured it would have gone away over night.

I didn’t end up sleeping due to how the pain did in fact get worse, and no longer was at a point to where I could tolerate it and not be bothered.

Here’s where I’m confused on whether this is a condition with my jaw, or regards my gums or my teeth.

I’ve massaged the outer part of my jaw muscle and it’s not sore at all. Not tender, not swollen, nothing. I’ve poked and prodded at the inside of my mouth to try to find the pain, and it is very sensitive behind where my last tooth is on my right side and where my jaw curves. The pain continues on the inside of the right side of my mouth and feels like it somewhat continues further down, but does not linger anywhere beside my last molar, rather behind it towards the curve of my jaw.

I’m 20 years old, the only medication that (I am not taking anymore) was penicillin when I had strep and I don’t have any wisdom teeth. 

It hurts like horribly to open my jaw and it hurts to swallow or suck out of a straw, etc. when I swallow it feels like there’s a shooting pain down the right underside towards where my teeth sit, but when I push on it, there’s no pain. I’ve drank hot coffee this morning and an ice cold Coca Cola, and there was no sensitivity with my teeth either.

At first I thought I had fallen asleep with my jaw open for a long period of time (my roommate (ish) came into my room yesterday morning and saw me knocked out and my mouth was open), but I figured it would have gone away over night.

I didn’t end up sleeping due to how the pain did in fact get worse, and no longer was at a point to where I could tolerate it and not be bothered.

Here’s where I’m confused on whether this is a condition with my jaw, or regards my gums or my teeth.

I’ve massaged the outer part of my jaw muscle and it’s not sore at all. Not tender, not swollen, nothing. I’ve poked and prodded at the inside of my mouth to try to find the pain, and it is very sensitive behind where my last tooth is on my right side and where my jaw curves. The pain continues on the inside of the right side of my mouth and feels like it somewhat continues further down, but does not linger anywhere beside my last molar, rather behind it towards the curve of my jaw.

It hurts like hell to open my jaw and it hurts to swallow or suck out of a straw, etc. when I swallow it feels like there’s a shooting pain down the right underside towards where my teeth sit, but when I push on it, there’s no pain. I’ve drank hot coffee this morning and an ice cold Coca Cola, and there was no sensitivity with my teeth either.

Another thing I should mention is that I do not have wisdom teeth, and never had any grow in. 

What the hell is going on with my damn mouth?",1,1746148567.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

Okey this happened in the end of 2022/early 2023, I'm currently 18f, for some context my mom and my dad are separated, they have my older sister and 4 years later they have me but for this time my mom hate him (he was/is a alcoholic) and was a really toxic relationship for some reason they continue a couple of years till my mom finally kick him out of the house. 
I was for the best really and my sister and I continue to see our dad and I can said he love us very much, but I think this touch something in my sister head, the separation and my existence of course, because she was the first grandchild of bout families, my mom and dad are the older child from their families, and she was incredibly spoiled because of that, till I born and ""robbed"" the attention. 
She and I grow up fight very much, verbally and physically, she never forgive me for born, but we started get along when our mom started dating to our stepfather, he was good in the beginning I accept that I was considering see him like a dad, but then he became a alcoholic like my dad but him and my mom are together till this day. We both hated him, he has never been physically abuse of any kind to my mom or us, but yes verbally and is EXTREMELY controlling and when he is drunk the house is uncomfortable, fights, smell of the alcohol or vomit, just see him pass out in the couch, is horrible.
He and my mom married and have our little brother in 2014, he is the only good thing of that relationship, and my sister and I love him, but I really hate the family and father he has, he love his father, and believes everything he said (not a good thing because he is a extremely religious person, I am bisexual and my uncle, brother of my mom, gay, also he teaches him that the evolution is bullshit, and more things but is not important) but my brother literally grew up seeing his dad drunk and his mom crying. 
My sister became a extremely weird person, she has this necessity to always be the center of everything, she really try to be a influencer, and always lied to everyone about things just to have attention, if you are in a discussion with her and she is losing she are going to yelling, literally yelling crazy and trying to scratch you with her long nails, she is a petite-otaku-vegetarian-crazy person. 
She always said that our mom doesn't love her because she don't buy vegetarian meat and more things for her, I don't know in other countries but in mine vegetarian meat is VERY expensive, my mom is a teacher and here paid very little to teachers, father is a chef but almost always is unemployed, stepfather has a little store, so we really don't have much money, my mom is currently still paying the house we live, so yes she always was a little crazy self-center person. 
I was worst when she started to being obsessed with criminals TV shows (CSI, Criminals Minds, etc) and it was always listening to podcasts or YouTube videos about true crimes cases and when she graduated for college started studying criminology I remember perfectly one time that she told me that they not just teach to how cach criminals, also teach how do the ""perfect crime"". She in the las years of college started dating, her boyfriend became a really good friend of mine but was obsessed with her that increase her ego even more, one time our coffee machine broke so our mom made coffee in a traditional way, put hot water in the coffe with filter paper, literally the same that does the machine, it was coffe, but no, she was not drinking that coffe, she made her boyfriend came to our house with a termo with coffe from a machine. 
In any discussion that they have she shut up him, she always need to have the reason and him literally just gave her all the things she wanted, if i said something and he agreed to me but my sister no he literally tell her that was sorry and then said that he changed opinion, again, it was creppy. 
In 2021/2022 she and I became best friends, thanks to Covid, we was always together, she have a boyfriend but cero friends, I have literally one friend and her, so for me was my best friend, but for November my stepfather was drunk, it was a huge deal and a very horrible time, but happened something, he was really, really sick, he vomited, and vomited, more that normal, almost died. 
He don't die, in January was fine, my mom already forgive him, and everything, in a close ""city"" ""place"" I don't know how explaining doesn't matters, there were some celebrations that take place every year, our father, one of hid sister and our paternal grandmother takes us to visit that celebrations, in the night we slept in my father house with them, but the next day my sister went there again but with her boyfriend. The next thing I know is that my mother is texting me tell me that my sister is in a psychiatric center, in a game she loses all her university money and she call my mom for more, then loses all that money too, she has a psychotic attack and the police don't know what to do with that thing so they leve her in the psychiatric, the boyfriend calls my mom, so she go there. 
There they do a exam in my sister and a interrogation, she tells huge lies, for example that we were physically abuse or that I try to unal1ve myself (spoiler later thanks to her I do star thinking that) but the most important thing is that she confess that she put cockroach poison in my stepfather beer and put a combination of pills that she maid dust on the container were was the lemon juice that my mom and I drink. I do remember that I grip the container because I want a drink and she look at me and said ""Are your sure? It taste bad"" I really don't give much attention and drink any way I FRONT OF HER and it taste weird, but in the moment just I think it was the refrigerator that gave that taste. 
When my mom read all the things she said a and do in the document when they let her out (YES THEY HEAR ALL THAT SHE DONE AND LET HER OUT THE SAME DAY, LIKE LITERALLY JUST CONFESSED TO TRY TO KILL THREE PEOPLE, INCLUDING HER MOM AND SISTER!????) she almost pass out, I don't know how they make it to the house, but the next day my grandma took me to the house and I talk to my mom, she obviously is a disaster, the she and my stepfather go I don't remember where o why, but I was alone with her. 
I was in a huge shock, but try to talk to her, she was acting so arrogant, I never going to forget how she see me in the eyes and said ""I do nothing wrong"", she was close to me then she go to her room, she is really, really small, i am like a head and half more tall than her and much more strong, we bot get bullied in school but when she just internalise all than pain I was fighting verbally and physically with everybody, if she don't go and keep tell me things I was really thinking about to beat her I sincerely wish that would happened for all that happen later. 
My paternal grandmother come and try to speak with her, we all sit in the living room, except for my stepfather, and talk she just repeat thar she do nothing wrong and laughing, she was LAUGHING, my grandmother tells her what about her boyfriend and career she just said that her boyfriend would never leave her, I sincerely think that if he try she would k1ll him. 
That night i slept in my fathers house again he was also in a huge shock, the next day my sister was gone, she run out of the house because OBVIOUSLY my mom was trying to get her moving in to my father's place. In the present she said that my mother kicked her out, she end it in a apartment that was paid for my maternal grandmother, she was in her side, she was defending her and tell us that she was no trying to k1ll us she just wanna that us ""calm down"". 
Then she sue my mom for child support, here if a child is not living with the Adult legally responsible for them that adult must paid child support till they have 22 years, or if the child no longer keep studying or they moving it with a partner, so we start with a legal battle, but again, with have no much money, no juts I started thinking about ended up and just give up on live, my mother too. In the end she lose and star paying child support every month to her, that put us in a hard time economically.
My mom packed all her things and her Boyfriends come for them, and my maternal grandma stard to tell me that a was being a bad sister because I don't wanna talk to her. 
She ended up living in my grandma house, my mother started to forgive her and let my little brother go with her, him seems to love her for some reason, she don't talk to much to my mom, she keep saying that my mom is horrible bla, bla, but my mom really wanna have a relationship with her. 

She is a totall asshole, crazy shit person, and I really, really hated her, I wanna insult her more but the insults in English are boring with no much meaning. In the present she is living with her husband, yes they married, my mom id not pay child support anymore, but is not fair, everybody forgive her, my brother love go to her place, my aunt, sister of my mom, is close to her, she is the mom of my cousin he has my same age and with are very close but she always see me weird, my grandma loves her, she work, keep studying, my mom trying to talk to her, went to the wedding, everybody does what she want, she love eat chess but that gave her strong digestive problems, literally her shit is like a rock, when she was living with my granma the toilet was not capable of ""suck off"" that rock, and she just leves my grandma go every time with a stick to turn the rock in to small peaces so the toilet will work. 

It's not fair that she literally have cero consequences, everybody loves her, my maternal grandfather have money but he lives far away with the woman that he leaves my grandma for, he takes my sister to vacations, and every loves her, she literally have a TikTok (but have like 5 followers) when she talks about how she ran away from a toxic family and mother, she talks like she was a poor victim, a angel that was being abused, obviously she not talk about de abuse of she to me (she loves making me bullying for my body, and in my birthdays always try to make me feel miserable) and don't talk about all the trying to k1ll my family things, in her wedding, I don't go but I see pictures, she was in a princess dress with a tiara, honestly she was ugly, and when she was starting to work she post a Instagram history with a picture of her and a text that said ""Is so hard this work, it's like putting Paris Hilton to work"". 

I wish I just could forget that she is my sister, that I have a older sister in general, that when for year a complete focused to be there to my mom and playing, caring and everything to my little, they no just love and prefer her, my mother really try to have a relationship and my brother loves to be with, play and be in her place, is obviously that she is her favorite sister. But is no just that, my mother always is telling me that a I am a ""close mind"" because I don't forgive, I don't want a relationship with her and I literally don't talk to my stepfather, we live together but I act like him don't exists, I love my maternal grandmother, but she keeps telling me that I am the bad sister because I don't want to talk to her, even been near her, she is telling me that we are always gonna be blood connect (I feel sick for that), that I am a bad person, I'm gonna go to hell (I'm gonna see her and my stepfather there so I want to be happy without them in this live) etc, my maternal grandfather is also telling me that I'm gonna forgive her I a point of my life, and that a I need to talk to her and stop being a bad sister, my aunt thinks that I am the weird and toxic one (I have a boyfriend) etc, it's 2025 and I'm still being call the bad sister and she is in a happy live with no consequences.

Here’s how I think they’ll write abt me:
-The science teacher will speak to my character and my quick thinking abilities, and just overall intelligence/humanity
-The English teacher will speak to my ability to critically think and stand up for what I believe in (I’m a strong debater in AP Lit) 

and I’ll have supplements from my drama teacher and maybe another teacher that I know well

I plan to major in Biochemistry and pursue research and advocacy for better medications for women. Yes, I know my ECs aren’t super relevant but I think they do show leadership. Which ivies should I apply to? Do we think I’ve got a shot at getting accepted to any?

EDIT: to be clear, I think I am delusional in believing I’ll get accepted to any ivy, but I’m wondering which I’d have the tiniest minuscule chance at. I am a strong writer and I plan to write about how my experience in performing arts allowed me to develop the confidence to pursue my passion for science. but I know it’s still a long shot.

How do I get my design not to wrinkle and fit correctly when I'm wrapping it on a tapered travel coffee mug blank from Michaels?,"I have a tapered travel coffee mug that I'm trying to sublimate with a full wrap design. I've gone through 3 blanks already. I keep getting wrinkles in the pattern or it doesn't fit tight enough in areas when I'm taping them. The first mug had tiny wrinkles form at the top of the mug when I was taping it. But the pattern isn't a solid color, there's mostly white for a background, so I tried to let it wrinkle in the white spots with the intent that the printed area would still made contact with the mug. I used silicone bands spaced evenly down the mug after wrapping and taping. I think that made the wrinkles worse, the middle did not have wrinkles when I taped it but did after pressing it. I could also see where the bands where because the mug had darker stripes of pattern where the bands where. I'm guessing either because I didn't wrap it tight enough even in middle, or because the bands are just to tight to put anywhere other than the top and bottom. The next 2 mugs I used shrink wrap that I pre shrunk with a heat gun before putting in the oven. They both came out with random areas that looked blown out or ghosted, and others that were perfect. I struggled to tape these as well. I got wrinkles in the middle near the seam on one, but none on the top or bottom. I got wrinkles near the top and bottom of the other but none in the middle. They both had the random spots all over that where ghosted or blown out. some that corresponded to known wrinkles and others that did not.  Could I have had the heat gun too close when putting the shrink wrap on to cause the blown out spots? The mug looks almost convex, maybe I don't have the curvature of the template correct yet and there were small patches where the transfer paper was not touching it? What am I doing wrong?
