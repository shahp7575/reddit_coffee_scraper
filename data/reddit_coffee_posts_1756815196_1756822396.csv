# **Original**

[**I (28M) with fiance (27F) about a month ago overheard her tell a friend her previous Ex was the best lover she ever had**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a492j5/i_28m_with_fiance_27f_about_a_month_ago_overheard/)

It was quite by accident that I heard this. We had a group of our friends over and as the night went on we all kind of busted out into little groups. Some of us were in one room playing Texas Holdem and a couple of others were watching a Lord of the Ring marathon. I thought she was watching the movies but she and one of her close friends were actually sitting in the kitchen drinking coffee and talking. 

Our group had run out of soda so I got up to go to the kitchen to get drinks and a couple of snacks. As I'm rounding the corner I hear my fiance talking and before I completely come in the room I hear her clearly say ""Jason is great but he will never be the lover that Bill was"" she then followed it up with ""Its not really fair to Jason though, Bill was just really gifted down there"".

At first I thought about just walking back into the card game and pretending like we didn't have any extra soda or food but I decided to kind of make a noise and go in. Her friend caught eye of me rounding the corner and I could see her make a face to my fiance letting her know I was there. Of course she has no idea I heard her and she just stops talking to her and asks me how I'm doing and if I'm having fun. I was tempted to say something like ""I'm having as much fun as someone who is not gifted down there can"" but I didn't. I just said yes and proceeded to get my stuff and go back and finish the night. I just acted like nothing was wrong the rest of the night and went to bed.

Needless to say it fucked me up. I mean fucked me up bad. I've never been jealous or what you would call insecure about myself until that moment. I couldn't sleep that night and I went through a myriad of emotions while laying there. At first I was angry. Then I was humiliated. Then I was depressed. Then I was angry again.

Look I realize that the male ego seems stupid to women and even guys who are totally self assured. I would have agreed with most of this prior to that night but once it has been damaged it is a bitch.

I tried to hide any form of emotion about it or ever let her know but as the days went on I just kept getting worse and worse. I was avoiding her at all costs and while she was suspicious she didn't really say anything. That is until she attempted to be intimate with me a few days later and I flat out rejected her. It wasn't by a conscious decision on my part by the way. I had made the decision on my own to just try and get over it and move on. But in the moment instead of being sexually aroused I felt deeply inadequate and ashamed. Nothing was happening no matter how much either of us tried.

She asked me what was wrong and I just told her I must have been stressed from work but she would not believe that or let it go.

So much to my humiliation there I laid, naked in bed, unable to get an erection. I came clean and told her what I heard.

Well this did not go over well at all. At first she tried to tell me I did not hear her correctly. But I just repeated to her verbatim what she had told her friend. Well once she couldn't deny it she then tried to apologize and to her credit she tried to listen to my feelings on the matter. Which once again I am sure was more of a big turn off for her because I was a wreck emotionally.

She tried to tell me how much of a better person I was and how I satisfied her and she wanted nobody else. But all I could hear was Charlie Browns teacher noise.

It's been almost a month and I have zero desire to be with her sexually. None. She is now getting frustrated about this as well but no matter what I have tried I just can not get past this. It's not like she said we were both good lovers or anything like that. She clearly said he was far superior and my guess is that being gifted down there means he was significantly larger than me as well. Well I know I can do all kinds of things with my hands, tongue and whatever else. But no matter what I do I can't grow in size. Obviously she refuses to talk about that with me saying that no matter what she say's it will only make things worse because even if she say's something positive about me I won't believe her. She's most likely right.

Some back story here. He dumped her. It was not a mutual breakup, he flat out dumped her and broke her heart. I know this because early on in our relationship she told me this. She said she wasn't ready to be serious about anybody because her previous ex left her and emotionally broke her. So this is not a case of me even being able to say ""well she's with me because she wants to be"". If he hadn't dumped her she would never have left him. Now I have no idea if after all of these years she would leave me for him if he would come back but I don't think she would.

I just don't know what to do here. I can feel myself checking out of the relationship. I know this is petty as shit but hearing the person you love tell someone else they prefer to have sex with someone else is just devastating to me. Her telling me all of my other good qualities has only made it worse because she is saying things that I think appeal to her and maybe other women but being told I am a good provider and will make a great husband makes me feel like shit. Like what would happen if I lost my good paying job or better yet what if I were to get injured and couldn't make anything more than state assistance, would she be there to support and help me? Basically what I feel like right now is a really good friend who she just allowed to have sex with. I know in my head that this is not correct but in my heart that is what I feel.

I'm sorry for the length here and I don't even know what I am asking here. I am totally lost and if this continues I just think I am going to break our engagement.

tl;dr: heard fiance tell her friend that previous ex was superior in the sack (presumable due to size among other things), relationship has gone to hell since and I need advice.

# EDITs FROM THE MAIN POST

**EDIT 1:** 

Holy God. I made this post last night and answered a couple of questions and then went to bed and got up today and went Christmas shopping hoping to make me forget my troubles and didn't even log in until just now. I have not even started to read the (at this point) 7.7 thousand comments on this post. I don't know what anyone has said yet but thank you all for commenting either way. I am now going to begin the massive undertaking of looking at the comments. Also thank you for the Gold and Silver kind internet strangers.

**EDIT 2:** 

Dear God. I read all the way down to the bottom of the page thinking I had gotten through most of everything and then at the bottom it said load the 5.5K more posts. I'm stopping for the night (well morning actually). I was going to respond to people individually but there is just no way. I haven't even started reading the direct messages to me yet nor have I opened any of the 20 chat screens. There are issues I want out there because there are a couple of things that are being said that are not accurate.

1. She was to use the Barney Gumble phrase using ""sweet sweet drunk talk"". In other words her and her friend were drunk while talking. Nope, neither of us drink. We don't even have it in the house.

2. That I am upset she told her friend. Well this is an odd thing, before I posted this honestly I wasn't that upset about this part. I was then and am still far more upset that this is how she feels. However now reading a lot of the post I have become somewhat aggravated that she did share this with her friend. I would never say anything about her to anyone that would put her in a lesser light.

3. That I am an insecure man child who should just man up and learn to do better. Well I'm certain the first part is true, being insecure and all. But the last part is just out of my control. No matter what I do I will only ever be 7"" long. We have talked about this btw, when she was trying to build me up. She said that I was already great with everything but the one thing I can't control. (Okay, so I gave myself about a half inch to feel better)

4. No I'm not going to do anything rash. It's already been a month so its not like this happened last week. But yes I have to decide what I am going to do here before long. It's not fair to either of us is I am just coasting through this and no longer committed.

5. She is sorry that I heard it. She said she is sorry she said it but at the end of the day she would not be sorry if I didn't catch her saying it. It is what it is. But yes I do believe she is regretting it because she has basically been a mess since I first told her. Me not wanting to be with her is bothering her a lot according to her. I don't know how much of that I believe but right now I guess I don't know why she would lie. It really has wrecked hell on our Christmas spirit this year I know that.

**EDIT 3:** 

Engineer for those who keep asking what I do for a living. She is a paralegal.

**EDIT 4:** 

People have been asking about the relationship with the ex and how I know she was heartbroken. We met about 9 months after they separated. I know that ultimately he wanted to be with someone else, although she has claimed he never cheated. He just ended things so he could be with another woman. She approached me at a local workshop and we started dating . On our 4th date when things started to get physical she broke down crying about the ex. It was certainly weird to hold someone while they cried about someone else but I did it. 

We sporadically dated for a couple more months in which time I never tried to cross any boundaries physically because it was obvious she wasn't over him so while we just went out of dates I tried to keep myself of the mind that we were just friends because I didn't want to commit either. After close to two months she drags me from my car to her apartment and begins to tell me how much she has appreciated my patience with her and how she felt stupid about dragging me along for so long. Obviously that was our first night together. Within 3 months of that she is telling me that she loves me. So yes, she was still hung up on her ex for fact when we got together. I had thought/hoped she was over him before this happened.

# **Update 1: Recovered- 3 days later**

[**Posting general response here. I (28M) with fiance (27F) about a month ago overheard her tell a friend her previous Ex was the best lover she ever had**](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a55jy1/posting_general_response_here_i_28m_with_fiance/)

The main thread has over 8.3 k posts and is a couple of day old now but I wanted to try and respond to some general thoughts.

It is absolutely impossible for me respond to everyone or even most people and at this point putting up edits I think is counter productive because the thread is a few days old now so I doubt people are going back to re-read the OP. I don't want to make an update there yet because I'm not really updating anything (nothing has happened yet, per se) however I have a few things to get off of my chest. So this seems like the best place to do that before I update my OP.

I have had so many people post on the original thread and twice as many people send me PM's telling me to hit the weight room and get in shape and transform myself into some form of weightlifting god. I am sure that these people are all filled with the best of intentions. Well not all of them because I have also had several people call me all forms of names while telling me to hit the weights.

Here is the problem for those people. They are using a stereotype about engineers and think that I fit that stereotype. I was a state finalist in wrestling in high school and got a partial scholarship to a division 2 school for wrestling. I competed both my freshman and sophomore years. However due to throwing a god damn baseball I tore my rotator cuff and while my recovery had me well on my way back my physical therapy prohibited me from being being ready for my junior year. 

I did not go back for my senior year as my work load and girlfriend were to much to also dedicate the time for wrestling. Wrestling was very physically demanding and time consuming. Now I freely admit that not training to compete did not leave me in even 1/8th the shape I was in at my prime I have stayed in shape. To this day I still lift and do cardio at my local gym. I've been getting my ass kicked lately by my friend who is doing a Mai Tai work out. I've been trying to keep up with him but freely admit I have a lot of leg work to do.

Now this leads me to want to focus on a couple of other things.

You will notice I said girlfriend. Contrary to what some of you have said or implied I was not some incel or neckbeard prior to meeting my fiance. I have had several girlfriends and yes even a couple of NSA relationships. So that is why this bothered me more than it probably should have.

In other words prior to this while I may not have been the worlds most confident guy I never felt like it was an issue. I've never EVER EVER had another woman say something like this in earshot of me about me. I mean did they say it when I couldn't hear? I have no idea but till the moment she said that I never had any self doubt or lack of confidence.

Now does me having this mental breakdown over this make me a ""man child, weak or straight up pussy"" as I've been called? I don't know, maybe. Hell probably. But bluntly speaking I've never had anything like this happen to me before. Every break up I've ever gone through was for the most part mature (I had a very childish breakup in high school but does that even count).

Also to all of the geniuses that keep telling me to learn a new technique or practice or just plain get better at sex. That's not the issue here guys. She didn't say that I could work on the issue at hand. She straight up told her friend that I would never be able to measure up (so to speak) because of a physical attribute that I can do nothing about. I could become an oriental lick master and at the end of the day I am never going to be able to finish her by jack hammering with what I can only imagine must be a 9"" dong.

Should that matter? Well it fucking doesn't matter if it should matter, it obviously does to her or she would not have said it. I don't know of any single way we can un ring this bell.

Which then brings me to the biggest thing I want to get off of my chest.

There are several poster, both men and women and ironically gay males over 30 who have a sub reddit that I guess I am a topic on, who have said ""it's just sex"".

Well, those words do not exist in my vocabulary for someone I love. I admit that I had a couple of NSA partners in grad school but even with them I developed feelings and had to part because I could not just do that. I don't do ONS and since my mid 20's have only participated sex via a relationship. I found out that I am just not capable of having sex and just having sex.

I get it, there are many of you who don't feel that way. Great for you, I don't feel that way and I am not going to fight myself to make myself feel that way.

Do I need to be my fiances best ever? Well, why the hell should I not want that? If you would have asked me before that night I would have thought I was, but now that I know I'm not. Well no I'm not really okay with the fact that I can NEVER measure up. I mean if I could work on something or improve something or take more time or something, sure. But to hear her say I can never be as good? Yea, sorry that is a little more than my ego can take. Call me whatever name you want, but it is what it is.

But some of the really most disgusting stuff that was said to me is that I should be happy that she is with me and allows me to have sex with her so she must want me.

ALLOWS ME TO HAVE SEX WITH HER. I can not describe in enough words how that offends me. Maybe I've lived in a Disney fantasy world for me but I always wanted to be with someone who wanted to be with me. Not someone who allows me out of some form of obligation. So does that make me a sissy (as a few of you have pm'd me)? I don't care if it does. I refuse to be a person who begs for sex, period. If whoever I'm with does not want to be with me as much as I want to be with her then fuck it, I'll just pay an escort and probably save myself money in the long run.

Look I don't know for 100% sure what I'm going to do yet, I have a very strong feeling what I'm going to do but I haven't done anything yet.

If this is the wrong forum just let me know. Anyway I'll try and do my best to respond to posts here.

# **Update 2 - 7 days later (4 days from the last post)**

[**(update) I (28M) with fiance (27F) about a month ago overheard her tell a friend her previous Ex was the best lover she ever had**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a6a8qj/update_i_28m_with_fiance_27f_about_a_month_ago/) 

It all came to a head last night. She just came out and asked me if I did not love her anymore and all that I could tell her was that a very large part of me still did but that what she said had really made it so that another part of me just didn't anymore.

This started a larger conversation that I won't bore you with but ultimately it came down to me saying that I would have heard that he was just better at something or more attentive to something or was able to do something that I would have felt like I could have worked on it. I would have listened to anything she wanted worked on any technique or anything else that she would have shared with me. But to know that I was never going to measure up simply because of a physical issue was not something I thought I could get over any time soon or if I ever could for that matter.

I was even honest and said that if it was just a ONS she had or some random guy who was just huge I might be able to get past that. But knowing that it was a guy who she was still madly in love with when I met her and only after time did she ever start to come around then it was just more than I could handle.

She kept trying to tell me how much better I was at everything else and that I should not throw away a lifetime over one aspect. I told her that that one aspect sadly was just to high for me, not all things are equal and that honestly it is a mental failing on my part that it is but whether it is genetics or a learned trait or whatever that yes I needed to be my spouses best and she has already made it clear that I can never be.

I tried my best to be gentle, I tried to take all of the blame of stating that I knew that my attitude was probably not healthy but it was who I am.

BTW I'm typing this as though this were a clean conversation, it wasn't, there was lots of crying (by both of us).

This is not a happy ending or even a satisfying one. I am beyond fucked up in the head over the entire situation. Everybody's Christmas is ruined. We had big family gatherings that we both were attending together and now we have to somehow break it to our family's what has happened.

This alone is causing me massive stress because my parents loved her and what in the hell am I going to say is the reason why we are not together? She didn't cheat and if I say that I felt like she was still hung up on her ex she will obviously deny it and she will tell them the truth. It's fucked up no matter how this goes down.

In the end I feel like a massive failure. I feel like a failure as a man because of not living up to comparison and I feel like a failure because I wasn't able to just ""man up"" and either get over it.

She has begged me to go to couples counseling and initially I said no because at the end of the day what does it change? We can talk about every single thing and I can try and look at things from a different way and at the end of the day the woman who I wanted to marry just told one of our friends that no matter what I do I will never be as good as her ex. I just can not see five years from now ever being okay with this.

But because she legitimately seems heartbroken I agreed to go. But that does not mean I will keep going.

Today I moved out a lot of my stuff and am staying with a co worker for a few days until I can get a place for myself. She has been with her sister all day.

I feel like shit.

Thank you to everyone who took the time to type out a response. I honestly have tried to read everything even if I didn't reply to very many.

The bitch of all of this is that I still love her. There is so much of me right now that wants to pick up the phone and call her and beg her to come back.

**EDIT 1:** 

Well once again I posted this and then went away for awhile. I went with my friend to see Mortal Engines and the to dinner and then we've been talking for a long while so I started reading awhile ago. It is going to take me forever to read and once again I don't think responding individually will ever happen because of the large number of posts and private messages. But thank all of you for reading and responding.

**EDIT 2:** 

I guess I do want to share one thing I spoke with her about. When we were having our very long conversation I presented her with a scenario for her to compare. I know her well enough to know that comparing body parts or sexual prowess isn't going to impact her the same way it would me. So I put the scenario to her like this. I said what if you walked in and overheard me talking with my friend Tim and you heard this. ""Jill is great but she will never understand me and comfort me the way Tiffany did"" ""But its not Jill's fault Tiffany is just the smartest most compassionate person I've ever known and Jill just isn't as smart"". 

Then if she would confront me about saying those things about her that my response to her would have been. ""I love you for all of your other qualities"". ""Nobody makes a sandwich like you do and I think long term you wont gauge me for my money"" At first she tried to say that this was a totally different issue but once we talked more about it she finally agreed it is because of the way we both approach and value sex. She ultimately admitted that this would really hurt her feelings but she would not break up with me over it. I then responded that even in my make believe scenario, which btw I would never say to anyone out loud about anyone I loved, she could improve her level of education and learn to be more compassionate.


**EDIT 3:** 

If anyone even reads this I want to add one last thing. People have been telling me what a whiny bitch I am (that's one of the more kind things they've said) because I can't get over someone else in the world having a bigger dick than me. Not going to lie and say I'm thrilled with it but I'm not dumb enough to think I have a giant magic wand or anything. I had grown up believing what I now know to be a lie that women don't care about size. 

Some don't but obviously some do and my ex is one of those that obviously did. But even with that ultimately I might have been able to get over it if it was just said as a matter of fact. But hearing that no matter what I did, how much I loved her or any other thing that I was NEVER going to be as good is what has bothered me since. Yes size is obviously a big part of it, but if I hadn't heard that I would never be the lover I think I might have been okay. 

Well not okay but at least not relationship killing. Yes I overvalue sex. I get that. Yes it is very important to me and well frankly I want to be wanted as much as I want to want someone, if that makes any sense. Yes I know whoever I date in the future will most likely have had someone who was either bigger, better or whatever. But I would really hope that they would not be still hung up on it a few years later.

# **Final Update - 63 days later (56 days from the last post)**

[**(final update) I (28M) with fiance (27F) about a month ago overheard her tell a friend her previous Ex was the best lover she ever had**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aom7po/final_update_i_28m_with_fiance_27f_about_a_month/) 

I wasn't going to post anymore but I am still getting daily direct messages wanting to know how things are going. I do appreciate the kind words and concerns.

But just so anyone who cares can know. It is over.

I went to counseling with her on three different occasions and honestly I tried to have an open mind about it. But at the end of the day the obstacle was just to much to overcome.

I even gave her an opportunity to walk back her statement or amend it or well do whatever she wanted to with it. But instead she double downed in a way. I think by that time she was very frustrated as well.

Neither of us are really happy about this. It has been an absolute nightmare for me trying to avoid telling people/family why we are no longer together. Of course I tried the old ""its none of your business"" to some of them but that failed spectacularly and since I refused to tell they decided she cheated on me and started spreading that around. I've had to do a lot of damage control over that.

I've decided to continue with therapy on a personal level because honestly this entire thing has really messed with my head and I have no self esteem left at all.

I've only seen her once since we separated and it was the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life. She is now, justifiably so, in the angry stage. She is furious with me and has called me everything that you can imagine and then even made up some words.

tl;dr: Its over. I tried going to counseling and things only got worse.

I've seen an image of the IMS convex line where it states its great for bottomless because of the flow of coffee stream in the middle right away, avoiding seperate streams.  
is this really the case? are there any downsides for convex? such as in non even grind dist inside the basket due to the convex shape in which case the grinds that sit on the perimiter of the basket will be over extraced potentially?

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

Please read my post on my profile it has extra information on it that I cant post on this one! ",2,1756821660.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

We got close fast. She had already been married, divorced, and had a baby. Despite that, we started dating. She told me she loved me, and eventually I said it back.

Everything seemed to be going great, but I had this instinct that something wasn’t right.
One day, she started acting cold and rude. I stayed calm, but whenever I said something, she accused me of speaking with a bad tone.
I tried to be patient, but eventually I couldn’t take it anymore. I told her I had somewhere to go, asked if she wanted to go home, but she said to just drop her back at the coffee shop.
That day, I didn’t speak to her.

The next day, I called her. She was acting weird and passive-aggressive, so I told her we should talk in the evening.
Later, I called her, but she didn’t pick up. I called multiple times from evening till night.
I was anxious and angry because I felt there was no reason for her to act like this.

Finally, I told myself, fuck this shit, I’m not going through this drama again.
(Because id my previous relationship)
I instantly blocked her, told her goodbye, and erased her number.

The next day, she we didn't contacted each other
At that point, I started feeling bad.
I wondered if I had made a mistake by acting that way.

The next day, I called her again. She answered. I asked if she was coming to work, and she said yes.
I waited for her there. She came, and we talked. I apologized, told her I had an anxiety crisis, and admitted I was wrong.
She got emotional and even cried a little.
I told her I would make it up to her and fix things.

But for the rest of the day, she was still acting cold and weird. At night, we talked, hugged, and kissed.
I opened up and told her I have anxiety that sometimes takes over me.
She said why didn't you told me and that she comprehend and thatvshe would know how to act
Then
She said we needed space.
I thought things were fine after that, but the next day she kept acting distant and even disrespectful.

So I stayed away.
Then she stopped calling and messaging.
I didn’t contacted her either
After a couple of days, I saw her across the street with another guy. I ignored her.

Honestly, I didn’t feel too bad at first.
I carried myself as usual, but deep down, I felt terrible.
Because if she moved on so fast, it probably meant that guy was already in the picture.

So what I want to say is this:
I just wanted to share my story.
Maybe my instincts were right and I actually made the right choice by cutting her off.
I’m sure about not going back to her, and I don’t give a fuck about her now.
But for some reason, I still feel bad inside, and I don’t really know why.",2,1756821554.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I had an affair and got pregnant. My husband doesn't know the baby isn't his, and I desperately want to keep it that way.

The affair started innocently enough. Ryan was the instructor at my Tuesday morning yoga class, and we'd chat after sessions about meditation techniques and healthy living. My husband Mark worked long hours at his accounting firm, often leaving before I woke up and returning after dinner. Our conversations had become limited to logistics about bills, schedules, and household repairs.

Ryan was different. He listened when I talked about feeling invisible in my own marriage. He made me feel seen in a way I hadn't experienced in years. What started as coffee after class became lunch dates, then secret meetings at his apartment.

I told myself it was just physical attraction, nothing more. Mark and I were trying to conceive, so when I missed my period, my first thought was joy, not panic. It wasn't until I calculated the dates that reality hit me like ice water.

The timing made it impossible to know who the father was. Mark and I had been intimate during my fertile window, but so had Ryan and I. The uncertainty gnawed at me for days before I worked up the courage to take a pregnancy test.

When the second line appeared, I sat on my bathroom floor and cried for an hour.

Mark was ecstatic when I told him. He swept me into his arms and spun me around our kitchen, already making plans for converting the spare room into a nursery. He called his parents immediately, his voice thick with emotion as he shared the news. His mother cried happy tears over the phone.

Watching his pure joy, I made a decision that would haunt me for years. I ended things with Ryan that same week, claiming I needed to focus on my pregnancy and marriage. He seemed relieved, mentioning he'd been thinking about moving back to his home state anyway.

I convinced myself there was a fifty-fifty chance the baby was Mark's. Maybe even better odds, since we'd been trying for months. I buried my guilt and threw myself into being the perfect expectant mother.

Mark painted the nursery a soft yellow since we wanted to be surprised by the gender. He assembled the crib with meticulous care, reading the instructions twice before touching a single screw. He talked to my belly every night, telling our unborn child about his day and promising to teach them to ride a bike and throw a baseball.

The ultrasound revealed we were having a boy. Mark cried right there in the examination room, squeezing my hand as we watched our son move on the grainy screen. I cried too, but for different reasons.

When James was born after twelve hours of labor, Mark was the first to hold him. The look of wonder on his face as he counted tiny fingers and toes made my chest tight with a mixture of love and terror.

James had dark hair and olive-toned skin, darker than either Mark or I possessed. Mark commented on how babies often looked different from their parents initially, and I agreed quickly, perhaps too quickly. But newborns change so much in their first few months. I held onto that hope like a lifeline.

The comments started at the hospital. A nurse mentioned how different James looked from both of us. Mark's mother studied the baby's features with a puzzled expression but said nothing. I caught Mark's brother exchanging a meaningful look with his wife during their first visit.

At home, the observations became more frequent and less tactful. Mark's sister asked if there were any dark-haired relatives in our families. His aunt wondered aloud about ""throwback genes"" and distant ancestry. Each comment felt like a pinprick, small but sharp.

Mark began studying James's face during quiet moments, holding him up to the light by the window, comparing the baby's features to photos of himself as an infant. I watched him searching for similarities that weren't there, and my guilt grew heavier each day.

Three months passed. James remained stubbornly unlike either of us in appearance. Mark's initial excitement began mixing with confusion, then something that looked uncomfortably like suspicion.",1,1756821410.0,FoundandExpose,0,1.0,False

I know that it's usually well-meaning, it's overwhelmingly from women who have likely had babies themselves, so even if it's somewhat clumsy, I appreciate the kindness. (Like, why do so many people say ""Congratulations!""? I haven't even had the baby yet!) 

But I got my first Karen comment yesterday. I was on my way to meet with friends and ordered a latte for pickup. But when I got there, I wandered  to the bakery section, considering getting treats for my friends as a thank-you for all they've done for me. Nothing ended up looking nice enough, so I went back to the pick-up counter to grab my coffee. 

As I did, Karen (she had the haircut and everything) said ""Good job!""

I was confused and groggy so I assumed she meant ordering coffee ahead rather than standing in line? I kind of awkward laugh as I reach to grab my coffee.

She continues, ""Because that crap would be really bad for the baby.""

My hand reaches my latte, I'm still not processing as I awkward laugh again and leave the shop. Only when I got to my car was I like ""wait... she sucks!"" I got judged for looking at muffins??? They weren't even for me, not that it matters. Since when can I not have a muffin? Hope she saw me grabbing my very much caffeinated soy latte lol

Have you ever noticed how a single thought can completely change your day? One moment you're feeling great, and then BAM! - a negative thought creeps in, and suddenly everything feels different. The truth is, our minds are incredibly powerful tools that can either be our greatest ally or our worst enemy.

## Your Mind: The Ultimate Game Changer 🎯

Think about it for a moment. What's the one thing that's with you 24/7, influencing every decision, every emotion, and every experience you have? It's not your phone (though it might feel like it sometimes!). It's your thoughts.

Your mental patterns have the incredible ability to either:
- Create unnecessary suffering and stress 😰
- Generate hope, motivation, and genuine happiness 😊

The fascinating part? You get to choose which direction your thoughts take you.

## The Double-Edged Sword of Thinking 🗡️

### When Thoughts Become Your Enemy

We've all been there - stuck in that endless loop of negative thinking. Maybe you're replaying an embarrassing moment from three years ago, worrying about something that might never happen, or convincing yourself you're not good enough for that promotion.

These thought patterns can:
- Keep you awake at 2 AM, staring at the ceiling 🛏️
- Make you avoid opportunities that could change your life
- Create anxiety about situations that exist only in your head
- Drain your energy faster than a phone with a cracked battery

### When Thoughts Become Your Superpower

But here's the plot twist - the same mind that can torture you can also become your greatest source of strength. When you learn to direct your thoughts intentionally, amazing things start happening:

- Problems become puzzles waiting to be solved 🧩
- Setbacks transform into setup opportunities
- Fear turns into excitement about what's possible
- Challenges become chances to discover what you're made of

## The Science Behind Your Mental Remote Control 🎮

Your brain is constantly rewiring itself based on what you think about most. Scientists call this neuroplasticity - fancy word for ""your brain is more flexible than you think.""

Every time you choose a positive thought over a negative one, you're literally strengthening neural pathways that support your well-being. It's like going to the gym, but for your mind!

## Practical Ways to Flip the Script 🔄

### Start Small, Think Big

You don't need to become a meditation guru overnight. Here are some simple strategies that actually work:

**The 5-Minute Morning Reset** ⏰
Before checking your phone, spend five minutes thinking about three things you're looking forward to today. This sets a positive tone that can influence your entire day.

**The Reality Check Question** ❓
When negative thoughts spiral, ask yourself: ""Is this thought helping me solve a problem, or is it just creating stress?"" If it's the latter, thank your brain for trying to protect you, then redirect to something more useful.

**The Plot Twist Technique** 📚
Instead of thinking ""This is terrible,"" try ""This is interesting. What can I learn from this situation?"" It's amazing how this small shift can change everything.

### Building Your Mental Toolkit 🛠️

**Thought Substitution Game**
When you catch yourself thinking something unhelpful, have a replacement ready:
- Replace ""I can't do this"" with ""I'm learning how to do this""
- Swap ""This always happens to me"" with ""This is just one situation""
- Change ""I'm not good enough"" to ""I'm exactly where I need to be right now""

**The Daily Mental Inventory** 📋
Before bed, ask yourself: ""What thoughts served me well today, and what thoughts got in my way?"" This builds awareness without judgment.

## Creating Your Personal Thought Revolution 🚀

### Step 1: Become a Thought Detective 🕵️

Start noticing your thinking patterns. Are you:
- A worst-case scenario specialist?
- A perfectionist who never feels satisfied?
- A comparison expert who always finds someone ""better""?
- A fortune teller predicting doom and gloom?

Recognition is the first step toward change.

### Step 2: Design Your Mental Environment 🏡

Just like you wouldn't leave garbage lying around your house, don't let mental clutter accumulate:
- Limit exposure to negative news and social media drama
- Surround yourself with people who lift you up
- Fill your mind with content that inspires and educates
- Create physical reminders of positive thoughts (sticky notes, anyone?)

### Step 3: Practice Mental Hygiene 🧼

Brush your teeth daily? Great! Now add mental hygiene to your routine:
- Start each day with intentional positive thoughts
- End each day by acknowledging what went well
- When stress hits, pause and breathe before reacting
- Regularly challenge thoughts that don't serve you

## The Ripple Effect: How Your Thoughts Impact Everything 🌊

When you start managing your thoughts better, the benefits spread into every area of your life:

**Relationships** 💕
You become more present, less reactive, and more enjoyable to be around. People are drawn to those who radiate positive energy.

**Career** 💼
Clear thinking leads to better decisions, creative solutions, and the confidence to take calculated risks.

**Health** 🏃‍♀️
Reduced stress means better sleep, stronger immunity, and more energy for the things that matter.

**Personal Growth** 🌱
You become your own best coach instead of your harshest critic, leading to continuous improvement and self-discovery.

## Making It Stick: Long-Term Mental Fitness 💪

### The 1% Rule
You don't need massive changes. Focus on being 1% more aware of your thoughts each day. Small, consistent improvements compound over time.

### The Support System Strategy
Share your journey with friends or family members. Having accountability partners makes the process more enjoyable and sustainable.

### The Experiment Mindset
Approach this as a fun experiment rather than another item on your to-do list. What happens when you consciously choose empowering thoughts for a week? What about a month?

## Your Thoughts, Your Choice, Your Life 🎭

Here's the beautiful truth: every moment offers you a fresh opportunity to choose your thoughts. You're not stuck with the mental patterns you've had until now. You're not destined to repeat the same thought cycles forever.

Your mind is like a garden. You can either let weeds grow wild, or you can cultivate the thoughts that help you flourish. The seeds you plant today in your consciousness will determine the harvest you reap in your life.

### The Daily Challenge 📅

For the next week, try this simple exercise:
Every time you catch yourself thinking something that brings you down, immediately follow it with a thought that lifts you up. Don't fight the negative thought - just add a positive one right after it.

### Remember This 💭

Your thoughts are not facts. They're just mental events passing through your consciousness. You have the power to observe them, evaluate them, and choose which ones deserve your attention and energy.

The most successful, happiest people aren't those who never have negative thoughts - they're the ones who've learned to manage their thinking patterns effectively. They've discovered that while they can't control every thought that pops into their head, they can absolutely control what they do with those thoughts.

## The Bottom Line 🎯

Your mind is the most powerful tool you'll ever own. It can be the source of your greatest struggles or your most incredible achievements. The choice is always yours, and that choice is available to you right now, in this very moment.

Start today. Start small. Start with just one conscious, positive thought. Your future self will thank you for taking this first step toward mental mastery.

Remember: the quality of your life is determined by the quality of your thoughts. Choose wisely, think intentionally, and watch as your world begins to transform from the inside out. 🌟

1n6k4t8,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1n6k4t8/the_weight_of_ashes/,The Weight of Ashes,"Robert Hayes never expected to feel joy again after Anna died. Some nights, he still woke reaching for her, fumbling blindly through the darkness for a hand that would never be there again. Grief, he realized, had a smell: old clothes, cold sheets, unopened mail.

Just before Anna’s passing, the twins had been born; tiny, furious fists clenching at the air. Every new day with them had felt like a second chance. Emma, with her mother's green eyes and fierce little laugh. Samuel, quieter, thoughtful even as an infant, furrowing his brow like he was trying to solve the world's problems.

They filled the house with life again. Noise. Color. Robert cooked terrible pancakes every Sunday. Emma demanding extra syrup, Samuel meticulously sorting his blueberries before eating. He read to them every night, even when they fell asleep halfway through. They built snowmen with mittened hands in the winter, fed ducks at the pond in spring, ran barefoot through sprinklers under the sticky heat of summer.

And every night, after the giggles and the mess and the exhaustion, Robert kissed their foreheads and whispered the same thing: ""I will always protect you.""

He meant it.

That November afternoon was gray and damp, the misty rain making the world look like it was dissolving at the edges. Emma wanted a pumpkin ""big enough to sit inside,"" while Samuel had chosen one lopsided and scarred, insisting it had ""character."" Robert strapped them into their booster seats, singing along with the radio, the car filled with syrupy, sticky laughter.

The semi-truck came out of nowhere. One moment: headlights. The next: twisting metal. Then... silence.

When Robert came to, hanging upside down from his seatbelt, the only sound was the soft hiss of the ruined engine. He screamed for them. Clawed at the wreckage. Dragged himself, bleeding and broken, toward the back. Emma and Samuel were gone. Still buckled in, so small, so still.

At the funeral, Robert stood between two tiny white caskets, staring as faces blurred around him and words tumbled into meaningless noise.

""God has a plan."" ""They're angels now."" ""Time heals.""

Time, Robert thought numbly, had already taken everything.

That night, alone in the nursery, clutching a sock no bigger than his thumb, he whispered the only prayer left to him: ""Bring them back.""

No one answered.

# Chapter 2: Hollow Men

The days after the funeral blurred together, each one a paler copy of the last. Robert woke at dawn, not because he wanted to, but because the house demanded it, cruel reminders of a life that no longer existed. Samuel’s alarm still chirped at seven a.m., a tiny little jingle that once made Samuel giggle under the covers. Robert couldn’t bring himself to turn it off. He brewed coffee he didn’t drink, packed lunches no one would eat, reached for tiny jackets that would never again be worn. Every movement ended the same way: with the silence pressing in like water in a sinking room.

He tried to hold the pieces together at first. Sat stiffly in grief counseling groups while strangers passed sorrow back and forth like trading cards. He nodded at the talk of “stages,” “healing,” “coping,” while his chest felt like it was filling with wet cement. He adopted a dog, a golden retriever named Daisy. The shelter said she was “good with kids.” Robert brought her home, hoping maybe something would spark again. But Daisy only whined at the door, as if she, too, was waiting for children who would never come home. Three days later, he returned her. The woman at the shelter didn’t ask why.

By spring, the house was immaculate, sterile, as if polished grief could make it livable again. The nursery remained untouched. The firetruck sat mid-rescue on the rug. A doll lay half-tucked beneath a tiny pillow, eternally ready for sleep. Sometimes Robert thought he heard them laughing upstairs, voices soft and wild and real as breath. Sometimes, he answered back.

Outside, the world moved on. Children shrieked with joy in parks. Mothers chased toddlers through grocery aisles. Fathers hoisted giggling kids onto their shoulders at county fairs. At first, Robert turned away from these scenes, flinching like they were gunshots. But soon, he began to watch. He stood in the shadows of the elementary school parking lot, leaning against his rusted truck, staring at the children spilling through the doors, backpacks bouncing, shoes untied, voices lifted in a chorus of lives untouched by loss.

""Why them?"" he thought. ""Why not mine?""

The resentment crept in like mold beneath the wallpaper, quiet, patient, inevitable.

One evening, he sat alone in the dim light of the living room. An untouched bottle of whiskey sat on the table, sweating with condensation. The television flickered with cartoons, a plastic family around a plastic dinner table, all laughter and pastel perfection. Robert stared at the screen. Then, without warning, he hurled the remote across the room. It shattered against the wall, leaving a long, ugly crack.

His chest heaved with silent, shaking sobs. Not for Anna. Not even for Emma and Samuel. But for himself. For the man he used to be. For the father he failed to stay.

The next morning, without planning to, Robert drove to the school lot before dawn. The world was still dark, the pavement damp with night. A bright blue minivan caught his eye, plastered with “Proud Parent” stickers and stick-figure decals of smiling children, their parents, and two dogs. Robert knelt beside it, the pocketknife flashing briefly in the dim light. He peeled the tiny stick-figure children from the back window, one by one. Then he slashed the tire, slow and steady, the blade whispering through rubber like breath.

When the mother discovered the damage hours later, cursing, frantic, dragging her children into another car, Robert smiled for the first time in months. A small, broken thing. It didn’t fix anything. It didn’t bring Emma and Samuel back. But it shifted the weight in his chest, just enough for him to breathe.

That night, he dreamed of them. Emma laughing, Samuel running barefoot through the grass, fireflies sparking in the gold-washed twilight. He woke to silence, the dream already fading. But something else stirred beneath the grief.

A flicker.

Control.

# Chapter 3: Seeds of Malice

The second time, it wasn’t enough to slash a tire. Robert needed them to feel it. Not just the inconvenience, not just the momentary panic. He needed them to understand that joy was a fragile, a borrowed thing, one that could be ripped away just as suddenly as it was given. Like his had been.

At dusk, the school parking lot stood silent, the last child long since swept up in a waiting minivan. Robert moved through the rows of bicycles like a man walking among gravestones. Each one upright. Untouched. Proud. He slipped a box cutter from his coat pocket. The first brake cable sliced with almost no resistance. Then another. Then another. He moved methodically, his grief becoming surgical.

The next morning, from the privacy of his truck, Robert watched a boy coast down a hill, fast, laughing, light. And then the bike didn’t stop. The child’s face turned. Laughter crumpled into terror. He crashed hard, metal meeting bone. A broken wrist. Blood in his mouth. Screams.

Parents swarmed like bees kicked from a hive, their voices panicked, their eyes wide. Robert didn’t move. He watched it all with hands trembling faintly in his lap.

He thought it would be enough.

But two weeks later, the boy returned. Cast on his arm. A gap where his front teeth had been. And he was laughing again. Like nothing had changed.

Robert’s jaw clenched until it hurt. They hadn’t learned. They had already begun to forget.

The annual Harvest Festival arrived in a blur of orange booths and plastic spiderwebs, cotton candy, and hay bales. Children raced from game to game, cheeks flushed from the cold, arms swinging bags of prizes. He moved through the maze like a ghost. No one looked twice at the man with the hood pulled low. Why would they?

Children leaned over tubs of apples, dunking their heads, emerging with triumphant smiles. Emma would have loved this. She would have squealed with laughter, water dripping from her curls, cheeks red from the chill.

His hands shook as he slipped the crushed glass into the tub. Ground fine, but not invisible. Sharp enough. Just sharp enough. He lingered nearby, heart pounding like a drum inside his ribs.

The first scream cut through the carnival like lightning. A boy stumbled back from the tub, blood streaming from his mouth, his cry high and broken. More screams followed. Mothers pulled their children close. Booths tipped. Lights flickered. The festival collapsed into chaos.

Still, not enough.

Robert returned home and sat in the nursery. The crib was cold. The racecar bed untouched. The silence as thick as syrup. He sat on the hardwood floor, knees to his chest, and whispered:

""They don’t remember you.""

His voice cracked. Not from rage. But from emptiness.

The playground came next. The place they had loved the most.

At three in the morning, Robert crept across the dewy grass, fog clinging low, as if the world were trying to hide what he was becoming. He wore gloves. Moved like a man fixing something broken. He loosened the bolts on the swings just enough that the nuts would fall after a few good pushes. He smeared grease across the rungs of the slide. Buried broken glass beneath the innocent softness of the sandbox. Then he left.

The next day, he parked nearby, watching as the playground filled with children again. The laughter returned so easily, as if it had never left.

Then came the fall.

A boy, maybe six, slipped from the monkey bars and struck his head on the edge of the platform. Blood pooled in the dirt. His mother’s scream sounded like something being torn in half. An ambulance arrived. The playground emptied.

Robert sat in his truck and felt that same flicker in his chest. Not joy. Not peace.

But control.

For a moment, he wasn’t the man who had clutched a tiny sock and begged God to make a trade. He was the one who turned the screws. The one who made the world bend.

He didn’t stop.

# Chapter 4: The Gentle Push

The river ran like an old scar along the edge of Halston, swollen and restless after weeks of rain. Robert stood alone at the water’s edge, the damp earth sucking at his boots, the air cold enough to bite through his coat. Across the park, families moved like faint shadows in the fog, children darting between the trees, their laughter muted and distant, like memories worn thin by time.

He watched them without blinking.

He watched him.

A small boy, maybe five or six years old, wandered away from the others, rain boots slapping through shallow puddles, his coat slipping off one shoulder. Robert saw how easily it happened, the gap between a parent's distracted glance, the careless joy of a child unaware of how quickly the world could take everything from him.

Robert moved without thinking. Not planning. Not deciding. Just following the pull inside him, a pull shaped by loss and stitched together with rage.

He crossed the grass in slow, steady strides, boots silent against the wet earth. When he reached the boy, he didn't say a word. He simply placed a hand on the child's small back, a touch as light as breath, the kind of touch a father might give to steady his son, to guide him back to safety.

But this time, there was no safety.

The boy stumbled forward. The slick ground gave way beneath his boots. His arms flailed once, a startled gasp escaping his mouth, and then the river took him.

No thrashing. No screaming. Just the slow, cold pull of the current swallowing him whole.

Robert turned away before the first cries rang out. He walked into the trees, his breath misting in the frigid air, his hands curling into fists inside his sleeves. Behind him, screams split the fog, voices shattered the quiet, parents running, wading into the water too late.

He didn’t stop. He didn’t look back.

That night, Robert sat cross-legged between Emma’s crib and Samuel’s racecar bed. The nursery smelled of dust and faded dreams. He placed his hands in his lap, palms open like a man offering an apology no one would ever hear, and he whispered into the hollow silence:

""I made it fair.""

The words tasted like ash on his tongue.

For the first time in months, he slept through the night, deep and dreamless.

But morning brought no peace.

By noon, the riverbank had transformed into a shrine. Flowers and stuffed animals lined the muddy ground. Notes written in childish handwriting flapped in the wind. Candles guttered against the damp air. Children stood holding hands, their faces pale with confusion as their parents clutched them tighter, their grief raw and noisy.

Robert drove past slowly, his knuckles white against the steering wheel. He watched them weep, saw their shoulders shake with the weight of a loss they couldn’t contain.

For a moment, he felt something close to satisfaction. A shifting of the scales.

But as he rounded the bend and the river disappeared from view, the satisfaction dissolved, leaving behind a familiar emptiness.

They would mourn today. Tomorrow, they would forget.

They always forget.

# Chapter 5: The Town Crumbles

Three days later, the boy’s body was pulled from the river, tangled in roots and mud, bloated from the cold. The coroner called it an accident. Drowning. A tragic slip. Everyone in Halston nodded and murmured and avoided each other’s eyes. But something changed.

The parks emptied. Sidewalks once buzzing with bikes and hopscotch now lay silent under cloudy skies. Parents walked their children to school in tight clumps, hands gripped a little too tightly, eyes flicking to every passing car. Playgrounds stood deserted beneath creaking swings and rusting chains. But it didn’t last.

A week passed. Then another. The fences around the park came down. Children returned, cautious at first, then louder, bolder. The shrieks of joy returned, diluted with only a trace of caution. The town, like it always did, began to forget.

Robert couldn’t stand it.

He returned to the scene of the first fall, Miller Park, under the cover of fog and early morning darkness. The playground had been repaired. New bolts gleamed beneath the swing seats. New paint shone on the monkey bars.

Robert smiled bitterly. Then he went to work.

He loosened the bolts again, not so much that they would fall immediately, but just enough to ensure failure. Enough to remind. Enough to reopen the wound.

That morning, a boy ran ahead of his mother, eager to swing higher, faster. Robert watched from his truck as the seat tore loose in mid-air, the boy thrown to the gravel below like a puppet with its strings cut. Another scream. Another ambulance. Another tiny victory. But it wasn’t enough.

One broken arm would never equal two coffins.

Thanksgiving loomed, brittle and joyless. Halston strung up lights, tried to bake its way back into comfort, but everything tasted like fear. Robert didn’t feel it soften. If anything, the ache in his chest had sharpened.

He found his next moment during a birthday party, balloons tied to fence posts, paper hats, children screaming with sugared laughter. Seven years old. The age Emma and Samuel would have been.

He watched from the alley behind the house, his jacket dusted with soot to match the disguise, just another utility worker. He didn’t need threats or blackmail this time. He didn’t need help.

Just a soft smile. A kind voice. A simple story about a missing puppy.

The little girl followed him willingly.

In the plastic playhouse near the edge of the yard, Robert tucked her gently beneath unopened presents. Her arms were folded neatly. Her hair smoothed back. He set Emma’s old music box beside her, its tune warped and gasping. It played three broken notes before clicking into silence.

She looked like she was sleeping.

By the time the party noticed she was missing, Robert was already miles away. He drove in silence, humming the lullaby softly under his breath, as if to soothe himself more than her.

But the hollow inside him didn’t shrink.

Winter came early that year. Snow blanketed the sidewalks. The playgrounds stayed empty now, not because of caution, but because of cold. Christmas lights blinked behind drawn curtains. People whispered more often than they spoke.

And still, the town tried to move forward.

Robert watched two boys skipping stones into the water where the river hadn’t yet frozen. They were brothers. They laughed without fear. Without consequence.

Samuel should have had a brother to skip stones with.

Robert crouched beside them. Smiled. Held out a daisy chain he had woven in the truck, white flowers strung together with trembling hands. The boys giggled and reached for it.

He guided them closer to the edge.

One soft push.

The river accepted them.

When their bodies were found seventeen days later, wrapped in each other’s arms beneath a frozen bend, the daisy chain had vanished. But Robert still saw it, looped around their wrists like a crown of thorns.

Elsewhere in town, Linda Moore sat in front of her computer. Her spreadsheet blinked. A child’s name, Eli Meyers, suddenly shifted rows. Not one she had touched. Not one she had assigned.

Beside the name, a new comment appeared: “He looks like Samuel did when he lost his first tooth.”

Then a new tab opened, her niece’s photo, taken from outside the school that morning. Through a window. Across glass.

The screen blinked red: “She still likes hide-and-seek, right?”

Linda’s hands hovered over the keys. She didn’t call anyone. She didn’t say anything. She just let the change stand.

That afternoon, Eli boarded the wrong van for a field trip. When the chaperones reached the botanical gardens, they came up one short. They retraced every step, called his name until their voices cracked. But Eli was gone.

The police found his backpack three days later, tucked under a hedge near the perimeter fence. Zipper closed. Lunch untouched. No struggle. No footprints. No sign of him at all.

Just silence.

The school shut down its field trip program. Metal detectors were installed the next week, secondhand machines that buzzed even when touched gently. Classroom doors were fitted with new locks. Parent volunteers were fingerprinted. A dusk curfew followed.

In a closed-door meeting, someone on the city council finally said it out loud:

“Sabotage.”

Maria Vance stood outside Halston Elementary the next morning. The sky was gray, the cold sharp enough to sting. Parents didn’t make eye contact. Teachers moved like ghosts. Children whispered like everything was a secret.

Maria didn’t need the pins on her map anymore. She could feel the pattern in her bones.

This wasn’t chaos.

This was design.

And whoever was behind it… they were just getting started.

# Chapter 6: Graves and Whispers

Another funeral. Another headline. Another casket lowered into the frozen ground while a town full of trembling hands tried to convince themselves that prayer could hold back death. Halston draped itself in mourning again, but the grief rang hollow. They weren’t mourning Robert’s children. They were mourning their own safety, their own illusions.

Still, life in Halston ground on. The grocery stores stayed open. The school bell still rang. The church choir resumed, voices cracking on and off-key. Robert watched it all from the outside, a man staring through glass at a world he no longer belonged to. Their fear wasn’t enough. Their tears weren't enough. They had forgotten Emma and Samuel.

So he decided to make them remember.

He found the perfect place: a crumbling church tucked into a forgotten bend of road, its steeple sagging like a broken finger pointed skyward. Once a place of baptisms and vows, now it stank of mildew and mouse droppings. Still, there was something fitting about it. Robert prepared carefully. He built a crude cross out of rotting pew backs. He scavenged candles from a thrift store bin. He smuggled in a battered cassette deck, loaded with a single song, ""Safe in His Arms,"" warped and warbling with age.

He thought about Emma humming along to hymns in the backseat, Samuel tapping his feet without knowing the words. He thought about the empty nursery and the promises he had failed to keep.

The boy he chose wasn’t special. Just small. Just alone. Harold Knox, the school bus driver, had been warned months before. A photo of his daughter tucked inside his glovebox. A note in red marker: ""He will suffer. Or she will."" Nails delivered in a plain manila envelope.

On a cold Thursday morning, the bus paused at Pine Creek stop. Fog licked the ground like low smoke. One child stepped off. The doors hissed shut behind him. Robert was waiting in the trees.

The boy didn’t scream. He didn’t run. He simply blinked up at the man reaching out to him. Inside the ruined church, Robert worked quickly but carefully. The child was lifted onto the wooden cross, his back pressed to the splintering wood. Nails were driven through soft palms and tender feet. Not savagely, but deliberately, with grim reverence. Each strike of the hammer echoed through the empty rafters like the tolling of a slow funeral bell.

""You'll see them soon,"" Robert whispered as he drove the final nail home. ""My little ones are waiting.""

He placed a paper crown on the boy’s brow. Smeared a rough ash cross over the child's small chest. Lit six candles at the base of the altar. Then he pressed play. The hymn trickled through the cold, rotten air, warbling and distant. Robert stood for a long moment, his eyes stinging, before he turned and walked away. He locked the doors behind him, leaving the boy crucified beneath the broken arches.

It was the boy’s mother who found him. She had followed the music, though no one else had heard it. She had forced the heavy doors open and fallen to her knees at the sight. The boy was alive. Barely. But something essential in him, something fragile and bright, had been extinguished forever.

Halston did not rally around this tragedy. There were no vigils. No bake sales. No Facebook groups offering casseroles and prayers. They shut their church doors. Canceled choir practice. Turned their faces away from their own shame.

Maria Vance stood outside the ruined church, the rain soaking through her coat, her hair plastered to her forehead. She didn’t light a cigarette. Didn’t open her notepad. She just stared through the doorway at the altar, at the boy nailed to the cross, at the candles sputtering against the wet wind.

This wasn’t revenge anymore. It wasn’t even grief. This was ritual.

That night, Maria tore everything off the walls of her office. Maps, photographs, reports, all of it came down. She started over with red string and thumbtacks, tracing each death, each disappearance, each shattered life. And when she stepped back, she saw it for what it was: a spiral.

Not random chaos. Not accidents. A wound closing in on itself.

At its center: silence. No fingerprints. No footprints. No smoking gun. Just grief. And grief was spreading like infection.

Parents pulled their children out of school. The Christmas pageant was canceled. The playgrounds sat under gathering drifts of snow, swings frozen mid-sway. Stores boarded their windows after dark. Halston was curling inward, shrinking, dying a little more each day.

And somewhere, Maria knew, the hand behind all of it was still moving.

She didn’t have proof. Not yet. But she could feel it in her bones.

This wasn’t over. Not even close.

Late that night, staring at her empty wall, Maria whispered to the darkness: ""I’m coming for you.""

And somewhere out in the dead heart of Halston, something whispered back.

# Chapter 7: The Spider’s Web

The sketchbook was found by accident, jammed between a stack of overdue returns at the Halston Public Library. A volunteer almost tossed it into the donation bin without looking. Curiosity saved it and maybe saved lives.

At first glance, it looked like any child's notebook. Tattered corners. Smudges of dirt. But inside, Maria Vance saw what others might have missed. She flipped through the pages with gloved hands, her stomach tightening with every turn.

Children, sketched in trembling pencil lines, filled the pages. Their faces twisted in terror. Scenes of drowning, of falling, of burning playgrounds and broken swings. Some pages had dates scrawled in the margins, events that had already happened. Others bore dates that hadn’t yet arrived.

Mixed among the drawings were music notes, faint staves from hymns, each line annotated with uneven, obsessive care. On one page, three candles formed a triangle, familiar from the church scene. On another, a child's chest bore the ash cross Robert had smeared. It was all there, mapped in quiet, meticulous horror.

One line, scrawled over and over in the margins, stopped Maria cold: ""I don’t want them to suffer. I want them to remember. To feel it. To see them. Emma liked daisies. Samuel hated swings. They laughed on rainy days. Please. Remember.""

She pressed her hand to her mouth, her eyes stinging. This wasn’t just violence. This was love. Twisted, broken love, weaponized into something unrecognizable.

At the bottom of many pages, a code repeated again and again: 19.73.14.8.21

It wasn’t a phone number. It wasn’t coordinates. It wasn’t a date. Maria stayed up all night breaking it down. Old habits from cold cases surfaced, simple alphanumeric cipher: A=1, B=2, and so on.

S.M.H.H.U.

Nonsense, until she cross-referenced abandoned businesses in Halston's property records.

Samuel’s Mobile Home Hardware Utility. A tiny repair shop that had shuttered years ago, its letters still ghosting across a sagging storefront.

The lease belonged to a man who had never made the papers until now: Robert Hayes.

No criminal record. No complaints. No outstanding bills. His name surfaced once, buried in an old laptop repair registration. The name Anna Hayes appeared alongside his. Deceased. Along with two children: Emma and Samuel. A car crash, two years prior.

Maria’s pulse pounded in her ears. She pulled the warrant herself. No backup. No news vans. Just her badge and a city-issued key.

The house at the end of Chestnut Lane looked abandoned. The windows were boarded. Weeds clawed their way up the front steps. But inside, the air smelled like grief had been embalmed into the walls.

She moved slowly, her footsteps muffled against the dust. The kitchen was stripped bare. The living room was hollowed out, the couch gone, the tables missing. Only the nursery remained untouched.

Two beds, one tiny racecar frame, one white-painted crib. Tiny shoes lined up neatly against the wall. Crayon drawings taped with careful hands: Emma holding a daisy. Samuel clutching a paper star.

Maria’s throat tightened. She knelt by the crib and saw it. A loose floorboard, cut precisely.

Underneath, she found a panel. And beneath the panel: photographs.

Hundreds of them.

Children on swings. Children walking home from school. A girl climbing the jungle gym. A boy waiting at a crosswalk. Her own niece, captured through the glass of a cafeteria window. Even herself, photographed at her office window, late at night, unaware.

On the back of her photo, in red marker, someone had scrawled: ""Even the strong lose their children.""

Maria staggered back, the room tilting. Robert hadn’t been lashing out blindly. He had been orchestrating this, piece by piece, grief by grief.

He had built a web.

And now she was standing at its center.

# Chapter 8: The Broken Father

They found him at an abandoned grain silo just outside Halston, a skeleton of rust and rotted beams forgotten by progress. The frost clung to the metal, and the morning mist wrapped around the place like a shroud.

Inside, twenty children sat in a wide circle, drowsy, confused, but alive. Their hands were zip-tied loosely in front of them, no bruises, no screaming. Only a heavy, drugged stillness. The air smelled of damp hay, gasoline, and old metal. Makeshift wiring coiled around the support beams, tangled like veins. Propane tanks sat beneath them, linked by a taut, quivering wire.

At the center stood Robert Hayes.

He was barefoot, his clothes coated in dust and ash, his hair hanging in ragged tufts over his eyes. In one hand, he clutched a worn photograph, Emma dressed in an orange pumpkin costume, Samuel wearing a ghost sheet too big for him, chocolate smeared across his chin. The picture was bent, the edges soft from being touched too often.

In his other hand: the detonator.

Maria Vance pushed past the barricades before anyone could stop her. She left her gun holstered. She left the shouting negotiators behind. She moved through the broken doorway into the silo’s yawning cold, stepping carefully as if entering a church.

Robert didn’t look at her at first. His thumb brushed across Samuel’s face in the photo, tender and trembling. When he finally raised his eyes, they were dark hollows rimmed with exhaustion, not anger. Not even madness.

Just grief.

""They laugh,"" Robert whispered, his voice rough, shredded from disuse. ""They still dance. They pretend it didn’t happen.""

Maria stopped a few feet away, close enough to see the scars time had carved into him, the way his shoulders sagged under invisible weights.

""They didn’t forget your children,"" she said softly. ""They forgot how to show it.""

Robert’s lip trembled. His grip on the photograph tightened.

""Emma loved the rain,"" he said, as if to himself. ""Samuel... he hummed when he drew. No one remembers that.""

""I do,"" Maria said.

The words cracked something inside him. His arms slackened. His body seemed to shrink. He looked down at the children, their heads drooping in the cold, and then, finally, he let the switch fall. It hit the dirt with a soft, hollow thud.

Robert Hayes sank to his knees, folding into himself like a man kneeling at an altar. The officers moved in then, slowly, carefully. No shouting. No violence. They cuffed him gently, almost reverently, as if recognizing they were not capturing a monster, but burying a broken father.

As they led him past Maria, he turned his head slightly. His voice, when it came, was low enough that only she could hear.

""I killed most of them,"" he said.

Not all. Most.

The word cut deeper than any weapon.

Robert hadn’t acted alone.

And Halston’s nightmare was far from over.

# Chapter 9: Broken Threads

Two weeks after Robert Hayes was locked behind steel bars, another child died.

A girl this time. Found floating face down in a retention pond behind Halston Middle School. Her sneakers were placed neatly beside her backpack, the zipper closed, her lunch still inside untouched. There were no signs of a struggle. No bruises. No cries for help. Just the stillness of the water swallowing another small life.

Maria Vance stood in the rain at the pond’s edge, her hands balled into fists in her coat pockets. She watched as divers hauled the girl’s body out under a gray, broken sky. Every instinct in her screamed against the easy explanation being whispered around her: accident. Tragedy. Bad luck.

But Maria knew better.

Robert Hayes was sealed away, his world reduced to a cell barely wide enough to stretch his arms. No visitors. No phone calls. No letters. And still, the dying continued.

Someone else was carrying the flame now.

She returned to her office late that night and faced the wall of photographs and maps. Not as a detective. Not even as a protector. As a mourner. Someone who had lost, and who understood the ache that demanded action, no matter the cost.

This wasn’t about Robert anymore. It was about everyone he had touched.

She didn’t trace the victims this time. She traced the helpers.

The janitor who had locked the wrong fire exit during the Christmas pageant. The administrator who had quietly reassigned field trip groups. The bus driver who had closed the doors before the last child could climb aboard.

Ordinary people. Invisible hands.

Maria started digging.

Brian Teller cracked first. She approached him without backup, without even her badge displayed. Just a quiet conversation at his kitchen table. She asked about the fire door. His fingers trembled around his coffee cup. She asked about the night of the pageant. He looked away.

Then she mentioned his son. The boy with asthma.

Brian broke like a rotted beam.

""They sent me a photo,"" he whispered. ""It showed a red circle around his chest... around his lungs.""

He thought it was a prank at first. A cruel joke. He hadn’t meant for anyone to get hurt. But Robert had known exactly where to cut.

Linda Moore came next. She was waiting in the empty school office when Maria arrived, staring blankly at the playground beyond the frosted windows.

""I didn’t want anyone to die,"" Linda said before Maria could even speak. ""They sent me a picture of my niece. Sleeping. In her bed. I just... I thought if I moved a name, it would be harmless.""

Harold Knox, the bus driver, took the longest. He didn’t speak at all when Maria placed the envelope on the table between them. The photos. The nails. The hymn sheet with the red slash across it.

His hands shook. His shoulders sagged.

""I thought it would end,"" he said finally. ""I thought if I did what they asked, it would be over.""

Maria said nothing. She didn’t need to. Because she understood something that terrified her.

Robert Hayes hadn’t needed to kill with his own hands.

He had taught grief how to move from person to person, like a contagion. He had taught fear how to whisper in the ears of desperate mothers, exhausted fathers, terrified guardians. He had taught ordinary people to become monsters in the name of love.

That night, Maria rebuilt her board one last time.

Not a network of victims. But of mourners. Of conspirators. Of grief-stricken souls trapped between guilt and survival.

She traced red string from each accomplice, not to Robert, but to the acts they committed, small acts, each just a hair’s breadth from excusable, from forgivable, until they weren’t.

At the center of the new web wasn’t a man anymore. It was a wound.

Robert Hayes had planted something that would not die with him. It had learned to spread.

It had learned to live.

And it was still growing.

# Chapter 10: Ashes in the Wind

Robert Hayes was gone, a hollow man locked away behind glass and concrete, his name recorded in a courthouse ledger no one cared to read twice. His trial was short, his sentencing swift. Life without parole. No outbursts. No apologies.

And yet, Halston didn’t recover.

The news cameras packed up and left. The vigil candles guttered and drowned in rain. The teddy bears and faded flowers piled at playground fences decayed beneath early snows. A few hollow speeches were made about resilience, about healing, about moving forward.

But fear had taken root deeper than grief ever could.

Children walked to school two by two, their hands clenched white-knuckled. Parents trailed behind them, glancing over their shoulders at every rustle of leaves, every parked car. Churches stayed half-empty, pews gathering dust. Christmas decorations blinked dimly behind barred windows. Laughter, when it came, sounded thin and brittle.

Maria Vance saw it everywhere. In the way playgrounds sat deserted even on sunny days. In the way neighbors no longer trusted each other with their children. In the way hope had been packed away with the last of the holiday lights, perhaps forever.

And still, the messages came.

No more crude threats. No more photographs. Just notes now, typed, anonymous, slipped under doors or taped to mailbox flags. Simple messages.

""We’re still here."" ""She still dreams of water, doesn’t she?"" ""You can’t save them all.""

Maria sat alone most evenings at Miller Park, sipping cold coffee as the swings moved listlessly in the wind. She watched a rusted carousel creak in slow, aching turns. She watched the ghost of what Halston used to be.

And she understood, bitterly, that Robert Hayes had won something no prison walls could take away. He had planted fear not in the hearts of individuals, but in the soil of the town itself. It bloomed every day, fed by memory and absence.

He had turned grief into a weapon. And he had taught others how to wield it.

Halston wore its fear like an old, threadbare coat now, something familiar and heavy and impossible to shed.

Maria kept working. She kept pulling at threads, reopening old files, retracing old paths. She chased shadows. She chased half-remembered names. She chased whispers of whispers, knowing most of it would never lead anywhere clean.

Because Robert hadn’t needed to give orders anymore.

He had shown them how.

How to wound without touching. How to kill without a sound. How to turn love itself into a noose.

Maria walked the town at night sometimes, past shuttered shops, past homes with blacked-out windows, past a burned tool shed someone had once set ablaze just because it “looked wrong.” Every porch light flickering behind a curtain. Every father standing a little too long at the window after putting his children to bed. Every mother who locked every door twice, even during the day.

This was the new Halston.

Not a place. A wound.

The final note came on a Tuesday morning. No envelope. Just a sheet of paper taped to Maria’s front door, the words typed carefully, the ink barely dry.

""You can’t save them all.""

Maria stood barefoot on the porch, the snow biting up through her skin, and stared at the note until the cold seeped into her bones. Then she struck a match, holding it to the paper until it curled black and drifted apart into the wind.

Ashes in the snow.

She watched the last of it vanish into the pale morning light.

And whispered to the empty, listening town:

In every generation, there exists a fascinating group of individuals who seem to march to the beat of a different drum. These are the people who often find themselves on the periphery of social circles, not because they're antisocial, but because they operate on a different wavelength entirely.

## The Misunderstood Observers 🎭

You've probably encountered them - the ones who prefer deep conversations over small talk, who choose solitude over crowded parties, and who seem to possess an almost uncanny ability to understand what others are feeling. They're the individuals who notice the subtle changes in your mood before you do, who remember the stories you told months ago, and who somehow always know exactly what to say during your toughest moments.

These perceptive individuals often puzzle us because they don't fit neatly into society's standard categories. They're not trying to be different for the sake of standing out - they simply see the world through a lens that reveals layers most people miss entirely.

## The Art of Emotional Intelligence 💡

What sets these individuals apart isn't mysticism or supernatural abilities - it's their extraordinary emotional intelligence combined with heightened sensitivity to their environment. They've developed what psychologists call ""emotional granularity"" - the ability to distinguish between subtle variations in feelings and moods.

This skill manifests in practical ways:
- They notice when a coworker is struggling before anyone else does
- They can sense tension in a room immediately upon entering
- They remember important details about people's lives and check in during difficult times
- They often become the unofficial counselors in their friend groups

## The Challenge of Depth in a Surface World 📱

Living in our fast-paced, digitally-driven society can be particularly challenging for these depth-seekers. While others are content with quick interactions and surface-level connections, they crave meaningful exchanges. This difference often leads to:

**Social Exhaustion**: Small talk feels draining rather than energizing
**Selective Socializing**: They prefer fewer, deeper friendships over large social networks  
**Overstimulation**: Busy environments can feel overwhelming rather than exciting
**Misinterpretation**: Others might see them as aloof or antisocial when they're simply selective

## The Innovation Paradox 🚀

History shows us that many groundbreaking innovations and social movements were initiated by individuals who thought differently from the mainstream. These forward-thinking people often:

- Question established systems and traditions
- Propose solutions others haven't considered
- Challenge conventional wisdom through careful observation
- Inspire change through their unique perspectives

The key insight here is that progress often comes from those who refuse to accept ""this is how things have always been done"" as a final answer.

## Practical Strategies for Daily Life 🛠️

### If You ARE This Type of Person:

**Energy Management**: Recognize that you process information differently. Build in quiet time after social interactions to recharge.

**Boundary Setting**: It's okay to decline invitations that don't align with your energy levels or values. Quality over quantity applies to social commitments too.

**Find Your Tribe**: Seek out communities, whether online or offline, where deeper conversations are valued. Book clubs, volunteer organizations, and hobby groups often attract like-minded individuals.

**Career Alignment**: Consider professions that utilize your natural abilities - counseling, writing, research, design, or any field that benefits from deep thinking and empathy.

### If You KNOW This Type of Person:

**Respect Their Pace**: Don't take their need for solitude personally. They're not rejecting you; they're managing their energy.

**Value Their Input**: When they speak up in meetings or conversations, listen carefully. Their observations often contain insights others miss.

**Create Safe Spaces**: Be the person they can talk to without judgment. These individuals often carry emotional burdens for others and need supportive relationships too.

**Appreciate Their Loyalty**: Once you earn their trust and friendship, you'll likely have a devoted ally who genuinely cares about your wellbeing.

## The Relationship Dynamic 💝

Relationships with these individuals require a different approach than typical social interactions. They tend to:

- Remember anniversaries, important conversations, and meaningful moments
- Express love through thoughtful actions rather than grand gestures  
- Offer support during difficult times without being asked
- Expect honesty and authenticity in return
- Need partners who can handle their emotional depth

The reward for those willing to engage authentically is a connection that goes far beyond surface-level companionship. These relationships often become the foundation for personal growth and emotional development.

## Building Confidence Around Depth 💪

Many people feel intimidated by individuals who seem to see and understand so much. This intimidation often stems from our own insecurities rather than any judgment from the perceptive person themselves. To build confidence in these interactions:

**Embrace Authenticity**: Stop trying to impress and start being genuine. These individuals value honesty over perfection.

**Ask Questions**: Show interest in their perspectives and observations. They often have fascinating insights to share.

**Be Patient**: Deep thinkers sometimes need time to process and respond. Don't fill every silence with chatter.

**Share Your Own Depth**: Everyone has profound thoughts and experiences. Don't assume you have nothing meaningful to contribute.

## The Growth Catalyst Effect 📈

One of the most remarkable aspects of connecting with these perceptive individuals is how they can accelerate personal growth. They often:

- Ask questions that make you think differently about yourself
- Notice patterns in your behavior you hadn't recognized
- Offer perspectives that challenge your assumptions
- Support you through changes others might resist
- Encourage you to pursue goals aligned with your values rather than external expectations

## Practical Applications for Everyday Success 🎯

Understanding and appreciating these individuals can enhance various aspects of your life:

**In the Workplace**: They often make excellent team members for complex projects requiring careful analysis and creative solutions.

**In Leadership Roles**: Their ability to read situations and people makes them effective managers and mentors.

**In Creative Projects**: Their unique perspectives can provide breakthrough insights and innovative approaches.

**In Problem-Solving**: They often see solutions others miss because they approach challenges from different angles.

## The Long-Term Perspective 🔮

As our world becomes increasingly complex and interconnected, the ability to think deeply, process emotions effectively, and maintain authentic relationships becomes more valuable, not less. These skills that seem ""different"" today may well be essential capabilities for navigating future challenges.

Consider how these attributes translate to long-term success:
- Emotional intelligence becomes crucial as automation handles routine tasks
- Deep thinking skills remain irreplaceable by artificial intelligence
- Authentic relationship-building creates lasting professional and personal networks
- The ability to see beyond surface appearances helps identify emerging opportunities

## Creating Space for Everyone 🤝

The goal isn't to categorize people or create an ""us versus them"" mentality. Instead, it's about recognizing that cognitive and emotional diversity strengthens our communities. Just as teams benefit from having both detail-oriented and big-picture thinkers, society benefits from having both socially energized networkers and thoughtful observers.

## Moving Forward Together 🌍

The next time you encounter someone who seems to operate on a different wavelength, consider it an opportunity rather than a challenge. Whether you identify as someone who sees beyond the surface or you're looking to understand those who do, remember that these differences in perspective are precisely what drive innovation, creativity, and positive change.

The individuals who think differently, who notice what others miss, and who dare to challenge conventional wisdom aren't anomalies to be fixed - they're valuable contributors to our collective human experience. Their willingness to walk difficult paths, to remain authentic in a world that often rewards conformity, and to maintain hope despite understanding life's complexities makes them not just interesting people to know, but essential voices in our ongoing human story.

By learning to appreciate and work alongside these deep thinkers and feeling individuals, we don't just expand our own perspectives - we create communities where everyone's unique strengths can contribute to something greater than any individual could achieve alone.

But to give a quick summary on the backstory of this sub, I created it roughly 7 months ago (Happy *almost* 7 month anniversary 🎉) because I had started getting super into writing League fics and I wanted a place to go talk about and share my ideas, thoughts, and ships. But when I looked around online there was no place like that to go to (outside of the handful of subs dedicated to only one specific League ship).

As a multi-shipper I wanted a space to discuss all of the many other ships (both well-known and rarepair ones) that exist in the fandom without issue and since that didn't exist I decided to set out and create that fandom space myself!

To start off, with help from this very sub, the rules for my sub follow a very similar foundation that's built off of the well-beloved and respected fandom rules of 'Ship and Let Ship' and 'Don't Like, Don't Read'.

I wanted my sub to become the ""one-stop shop"" of sorts to go to for all things and happenings in the League fandom. So, I've worked to gather up a range of information to make that a reality.

* I did a lot of research and, to the best of my ability, have created a [cumulative list](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShipsofRuneterra/comments/1k5ex7o/share_your_love_for_your_favorite_pairings_with/) of all of the League and Arcane Ships Weeks that currently exist.
* I've created a widget on my sub showcasing an ever-growing community complied fic list of fans' most personally beloved fics and it's always open for more to be added via [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShipsofRuneterra/comments/1kr4xct/share_the_fics_that_you_think_best_showcase_your/).
* I've also created a monthly, for-fun event called [Theme Weeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShipsofRuneterra/comments/1kc7y38/introducing_a_new_event_to_celebrate_the_growth/) to encourage our community to create and share their fanwork and show off the love for their favorite characters and ships. (Here's some examples of past ones: [Magical Girl Week](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShipsofRuneterra/comments/1kyauqh/june_1st_june_7th_theme_week_magical_girl_week/), [Coffee Shop Week](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShipsofRuneterra/comments/1kcl3as/may_1st_may_7th_theme_week_coffee_shops_and_caf%C3%A9s/), and [Animal Transformation Week](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShipsofRuneterra/comments/1lo7pue/july_1st_july_7th_theme_week_animal/).)
* For any possible new League fans joining the sub I've made sure to, on the sidebar of my sub, comply together all of the official places to check out the lore of League and a collection of places and accounts to start checking out. I've linked the League and Arcane fandoms on Ao3 as well as well-known League fanartists and content creators within the community.
* There's also a range of posts that you can make on my sub.
   * You can share other people's fanwork you find (with credit)
   * You can promote your own fanwork
   * You can ask for fics recs
   * Start discussions about a range of fandom-related topics
   * Participate in new and upcoming events
   * Have ship and smut talks
   * Do deep-dive character explorations
   * Share your brainstorm ideas
   * Share something that inspired you
   * Celebrate a champion's birthday or a personal fandom achievement
   * Share League fandom memes
   * Share Ship Week fanwork you've made
   * Vent about the League fandom
   * Ask for lost fic help or any other fandom-related questions
* We have a connected Discord server called the LoL Writing Server for the sub as well if that interests you. Here's the [invite link](https://discord.gg/j97zjfnWw5) for that!

Since becoming mostly a League fic writer myself, for the first time in all of my years of being in fandom, I've now gotten the desire to interact with other fan creators within the space, and be active in events, and participate in the online fandom space as a whole! Which is why I've worked to create a space where that can happen.

If you are any type of League of Legends fan and anything that I've shared sounds interesting to you, I would absolutely love it if you'd check out and and join my League fandom sub, r/ShipsofRuneterra!

-alternating protein (Matrix Instacure Sytem) with moisture (Pantene Shampoo & Dove Intensive Repair Serum Mask).
-Eating WAY more protein and including a 30g protein smoothie a least once per day.
-1 scoop of collegen powder w MCT oil in my coffee per day.
-VITAMINS! Cod liver oil, a multi, D & K, magnesium, and Co-q 10.
-Going back to brunette. Colour and trim every 8 weeks.

I am using Firefox since version 1 (I switched from IE 6.0 back then as I recall) and it's still my most favorite browser.

But there is one thing that really keeps annoying me more and more - and that's how extremely bloated it became over the years. It used to be really fast and really lean browser, I remember I was running tens, maybe hundreds of tabs back in \~2005 on a PC that had maybe 512MB of RAM and ff was using over 100MB of RAM on the bad days.

Now I have 64GB RAM and FF easily eats over 40GB with only about 90 tabs open - yes I know webpages has gotten more ""complex"", but besides this massive increase in resource consumption it seems to me that Mozilla keeps stuffing it up with more and more absolutely useless features that nobody asked for. Prime example being their ""pocket"" which forced into default install, required an account and looked like a download button, so you kept clicking on it when you wanted to just display downloaded apps.

Then there are all these Mozilla cloud garbage things, some AI bullshit and more and more weird security features - like popups asking if I want to enable local storage in chat gpt which I have to deny every single time with no checkbox if I want to do it permanently, which keeps coming back, forced HSTS which can't be overriden (which literally forced me to install Chrome which can do that), various fancy buttons and popups etc etc.

Most annoying security feature I have ever seen is that ""Firefox was updated and must be restarted"" that completely randomly shows up on a new tab in the worst possible moment and cripples entire browser until restart in the middle of unfinished work in progress.

Who even asked for that? Why aren't these extensions? Why can't the base browser be small, simple and resource efficient? I just want a web browser not a Web-OS with integrated coffee machine and a vacuum cleaner.

1n6jpvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1n6jpvl/why_choose_the_mr_coffee_cup_programmable_coffee/,Why Choose the Mr. Coffee Cup Programmable Coffee Maker Review for Small Spaces?,"Testing the Mr. Coffee 2191951 Cup Programmable Coffee Maker was like inviting a versatile and compact partner into my small kitchen. This programmable drip coffee machine impressed me from the get-go with its blend of practicality and elegance. With its black and chrome-polish exterior, this unit is no eyesore—it sat snugly next to my toaster without hogging counter space.

**User-Friendly Design**  
The sleek design isn't just for show; it’s extremely well thought out. The ergonomic carafe, with its ounce markings, eliminates the guesswork often involved in measuring water or coffee. I found the 25-ounce capacity to be just right—perfectly suited for two generous 12-ounce cups of coffee. This machine doesn't take up much space but still delivers that morning boost with efficiency. Buttons on this coffee maker are tactile and responsive, making the whole operation refreshingly intuitive.

**Effortless Programmability**  
Something I deeply appreciated was the “brew later” functionality. Before heading to bed, I set the timer, and like magic, I woke up to the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Programming it was straightforward, with clear buttons and no unnecessary complications. For someone who gets grumpy without caffeine (guilty), this feature instantly made mornings smoother.

**[Check Mr. Coffee 2191951 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b081dnwg7n/)**  

**Strengths**  
This machine packs a punch when it comes to keeping coffee lovers happy.  

- Its compact design is a boon for small kitchens.  
- The reusable filter saves money and reduces waste.  
- Features like auto-pause add convenience for those who need their coffee NOW.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Though my experience was mostly positive, a few things stood out that could be better:

- The brewing process can be noisy; it's not ideal if your mornings are meant to be noise-free.  
- Cleaning the reusable filter requires effort; you’ll have to be diligent to maintain that perfect brew taste.  
- The capacity might feel limited to households with more than two coffee-drinkers.  

**Day-To-Day Reliability**  
I’ve relied on this coffee maker daily for weeks, putting almost every feature to the test. The machine’s auto shut-off proved to be a lifesaver when I forgot to turn it off before rushing out the door—an excellent safety and energy-saving addition. The auto-pause function worked flawlessly when I couldn't wait for the full pot to brew. No drips, no spills, just a mid-brew cup of coffee to keep me going.

**Competing Products**  
Mr. Coffee’s 5-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker is up against big names like Keurig K-Mini and Black+Decker's 5-cupper, so it's not flying solo in this field. Where it excels is its programmability and reusable filter—something the basic Keurig lacks. However, the Keurig does bring variety in brew pods, which some may favor. Black+Decker’s model is similarly priced but lacks the sleek design and ergonomic appeal of this coffee maker. The direct competitors have their strengths, but this compact unit's mix of thoughtful features and design managed to edge them out in my book.

**Worth Every Penny**  
Cost-wise, the coffee maker sits comfortably in a range where it doesn’t hit you too hard, especially considering its versatility. You’re investing in a little brew wizard that lets you wake up to hot coffee, offers precise measuring and reuse options, and doesn’t ask for a barista's salary in return.

Been trying to be as careful as possible, wearing a mask all the time since many people are sick, not eating anything from there since we don't know how it is prepared, being careful about touching surfaces, not going to any events that are crowded, but I can't help but feel my life is completely changed since this. I have to carry a huge box which my mom prepares so everything I eat is hygienic and on days that are long I end up starving since I can only carry so many boxes. I also have an acl tear and my knee is all swollen by the end of the day, and any extra weight I carry ends up hurting my knee. On most days I'm starving but I can't eat once I'm back home either since I'll be back home by 6:30 around which is when I take my tac tablet and have to wait until 7:30. I ate 2 bananas but that doesn't feel like it did anything at at all.There aren't any foods there that are steaming hot so I can be sure that they're safe to eat, and I just feel too paranoid to eat anything outside because of the germs and the fact that if I fall sick I'll have to miss some time at uni and might find it hard catching up later, so I end up starving, hunger headache, knee in pain by the end of the day.

Sorry if this has turned into a rant of any sort but this just feels like a really bad day with nothing I can do to rebel without overthinking it. I know I'll feel better once I'm able to eat something but this is just one of those days where i feel the weight of everything that has ever happened to me. I just feel so different from the people there, like I'm truly alone no matter how much I try and bond w them. I guess this is just the prednisone hunger and mood swings, but I was close to tears because of how hungry I was and couldn't do anything for next 4 hours, still can't eat for another half an hour. 

I guess my question was what can I eat over there where there's no risk of germs? most of the food served there is cold including rolls, wraps, sandwiches, cake, deep fried stuff which I could not eat when I'm hungry since I feel acidic, coffee which I bought but didn't drink because it was given through this machine which did not look that clean. For context I'm from a third world country, so the only foods my transplant nephro has approved are things that are steaming hot so you don't have to worry about bacteria.

Page was a 38-year-old Staff Sargent when he reported to A Troop, 3/4 Cav. in early October 1967.  He stood around six feet tall and weighed in at more than two hundred pounds.  The heat in the coming dry season would take off a lot of his excess poundage, but he never got rid of his pot belly.  He was like quite a few African-American men of his generation,  using the integrated Armed Forces to lift himself out of the grinding poverty that trapped so many men of color.  He already had twenty years invested in the Army, and bitterly cursed and swore at his decision to stay in and go to Vietnam rather than retire. 
     He was packed off to the week-long training/refresher classes that were run by Division Headquarters, and was assigned to Saber Alpha 11 as the first platoon's Scout Section leader.  He spent the first day back meeting with the other three scout track commanders, sitting in the mess hall drinking coffee, getting their input about the war and fighting methods, and discussing the other three crews on A12, A13, and A14.  Pretty routine stuff all in all; the next day, he spent making the acquaintance of Joe Cowthran and me.
     Our first meeting with 'Pop', as he liked to be called, was a bit of a disappointment to Joe and me.  We had both been in the country since late July, had been in a few small firefights, and maybe not as experienced as some of the short timers, but we were far from being FNGs.  Pop thought differently.  He said that the track was filthy and didn't think we were much cleaner, didn't like our haircuts, thought personal hygiene was a concept unfamiliar to us, didn't like our 'military bearing', and even thought our weapons were in danger of blowing up in our hands because of the great boulders of dirt in them.  Pop made us drag everything out of A11 and, after a thorough cleaning, put things back properly.  Next came the two big fifties.  Track one-one didn't have a side-mounted M—60 machine gun; instead, we had a side-mounted fiftycaliber machine gun in addition to the one in the TC's turret.  That was day one with Pop; it didn't get any better for quite some time.   
The next day he had us check the barrels of both fifties, reset the timing and head space, asked about the two spare barrels we were supposed to have and didn't, and loudly and irately called up to the heavens for an answer as to why he was put into the middle of a war with two of the dumbest, dim-witted, fools he had ever encountered wearing the uniform of the US Army.  Pop prayed a lot like that.
     We were out beating the bush the following week; Pop's eyes were bulging out for the first day or so.  Little by little, he calmed down. Joe and I were taking less and less verbal abuse as Pop started to realize his life depended on us as much as our lives depended on him.  Toward the end of that week, Pop even caught a few hours of sleep at night.  Things started to settle down.  Each night we'd throw the bull for a couple of hours, Joe would try to identify Pop as a fellow 'soul brother', Pop told Joe that the only brother he had was his M16.  They finally got together over an elderly black comedienne I had never heard of named Moms Mabley.  Joe used this to teach me further about 'Soul'.  He was going on about an old woman who used to cook hamburgers near his house in Kansas City.  He claimed that her sweat dripping onto the cooking burgers lent them just the right amount of 'soul'.  Pop said Joe was the dumbest black boy he'd ever met.
     We started the thunder runs not too long after Pop's first mission with us.  Thunder runs were nighttime cruises up and down Highway 1 in order to secure the Main Supply Route for nighttime convoys between Tay Ninh and Saigon.  We spent every night for a month racing through the villages and hamlets that lined the road, stopping for an hour or two in open areas.  We got hit twice on Monday and Wednesday of Thanksgiving week.  Just an RPG hit on the rear tank of our column from the last hooch in a small hamlet.  We had a couple of men wounded, nothing too bad. 
     One night, as we were getting ready in the motor pool, Pop came up to us with another GI in tow.  I forget his name now, but he was a career army man in his mid-thirties with the rank of Spec-4.  He was a little, scraggly-looking white man and couldn't have weighed more than a hundred pounds.  Joe and I both thought that Pop would be as rough on him as he was with us at first.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Pop and this fellow hit it off so well that Joe and I were thunderstruck.  Pop even took the can of peaches from the C-rations I thought I hid and gave it to this guy.  While the two of them acted like girls with their hair let down, Joe and I muttered dark imprecations about the unfairness of life.  The next morning, this lifer idiot had a small fire going to heat coffee for him and Pop while the platoon was stopped just outside of Phuk Mei.  The Lieutenant called over the radio, hollering about the fire, and told Pop to get some security out.  Pop sent me and his new girlfriend out as an LP, and we promptly got a grenade thrown at us.  Naturally, it hit the ground on my side of the well we were sitting around.  No damage, but I felt like shooting our little coffee drinker.
     Joe and I thought we cured Pop of this kind of nonsense, but damn if he didn’t do it again.  It was right before Christmas,   Pop came back from the Lieutenant's track with the goofiest looking white boy either Joe or I had ever seen.   Joe and I felt sorry for this kid.  Anyone would.  He was altogether too ‘too’.  He was too tall and he was too skinny.  He was too quiet, and he was too polite. His teeth were too crooked, and he had too many freckles.  He was too scared, and he was too nice.  His hair was too dark to be blonde, and it was too light to be brown. He would have done any mother proud.   It would have worked on Joe and me, except we knew Pop.  After kicking me off my favorite perch on the back ramp and threatening Joe with several mysterious disapprobations about being black and what he could do with that, Pop sat the young man down and started taking a family history.  Satisfied that the young man was church going and God fearing,  Pop told him to bed down, and Pop would wake him for a shared watch from four to six in the morning.  Since our coffee drinking warrior had talked Pop into a permanent 10-to-midnight slot, Joe and I always ended up taking turns between midnight and 4 AM.  Did I mention Pop's keen sense of fair play?
     We lost the young man to the infantry track a week later.  They were short, and four men to a scout track were more normal.  Pop was inconsolable and solved the mystery for Joe and me as he watched the boy cross our laager to Saber-Alpha 28.  With lips that quivered with emotion, Pop told us that 'those skinny white boys from back in the boondocks always wet their finger to test the wind before they fired and always hit what they fired at'.  He went on for a while, loudly doubting a Kansas City 'hoodlum' like Joe or a pampered suburban white boy like me could ever learn the skills Pop figured he'd need if he was to survive his tour.  We never did figure out if he was serious or not.
    The Troop was back in Cu Chi the following week, and the second morning back, we had an awards and decorations formation.  One of the guys from the infantry track was awarded a Bronze Star for Heroism and passed the certificate around for all of us to admire.  Pop was in the hooch at the time and shrewdly watched as I held it and secretly wished it were mine.  'You like that medal, white boy, ' he asked me.  Like the fool I was, I told Pop that I wished I had one and got myself a new nickname.  'Maaah Heerooooo,” Pop crooned, and never called me by anything else ever again.  'Don't you worry, boy, I'm gonna see to it that you win the Medal of Honor.  I'm gonna throw your sorry ass on the first grenade that hits the ground within a ten-meter circle of me.”
Then, before any of Pop’s predictions could come true, it was the 20th of January.  Our Second platoon was scrambled out of Wolfhound gate to escort a convoy from the town of Cu Chi back into the base.  They were hit hard in an ambush, not even a mile outside base camp.  Of the 27 men hit, ten were killed, and many had suffered tour-ending wounds.  The first and third platoons scrambled out in reaction, far too late.  We spent the rest of that night watching the tracks burn, knowing that young men were inside the burning wrecks.
      We spent the next few days in Cu Chi, where chaplains came and went. Before we knew it, about six guys each were taken from the first and third platoons and sent to the second.  That way, each platoon had about the same number of replacements.  I ended up in the second platoon, and it was like starting my tour all over again.  A week later, the Tet Offensive exploded over the countryside, and the platoons were strung out from Go Da Ha to Cu Chi.   Charlie Troop at Cu Chi was scrambled down Route 1 and first saved Tan Son Nhut by cutting through the attacking VC and NVA, and then, with Bravo Troop, crushed three battalions of VC and NVA at the end of the runway. 
     We didn’t get to that fight, but our first and third platoons were sent to Trang Bang and Cu Chi, covering the MSR with platoons instead of Troops.  Pop and Joe rode out with the rest of the first platoon, heading for Trang Bang, while we watched and suddenly became awfully lonely.  The three-line platoons of A Troop stayed split apart for the next two weeks; most of that time, Pop and Joe were around the US Embassy in Saigon.  We finally got back together on the night of the 13th of February when we laagered up outside of Ap Cho.   When our position had been dug out and sandbagged, I hotfooted it over to A11.  Pop grunted a greeting, and Joe and I sat down to gossip.  We killed about two hours catching up before I made my way back to my new track.
     The next morning, while doing all the wake-up things, I moved to the front of the Track to take a leak.   To my horror, my urine splashed out with a decidedly brown color.  Hollering for Doc Larry Lick, I ran to the A20 track and told him my problem.  He seemed unconcerned, took out his prescription pad, and told me to take the morning chopper back to Cu Chi and get it checked out at the 12th Evac.  I told the Lieutenant, told my track TC, and had enough time to go over to Joe and tell him about it.  He wanted to know how he could get the same thing.
     I flew into Cu Chi, hitched a ride to the hospital, peed into a jar, and then sat around for two hours waiting for the medical verdict.  A medic called out my name and told me that I’d been drinking too many Cokes and wrote on the prescription that I  was to return to field duty.
I hitched a ride back to the orderly room and promptly joined the crowd around the radio.  The Troop was in heavy contact and taking casualties.   The other guys told me that the Troop was assaulting repeatedly, pulling back from time to time for air force and gun ship strikes.  Captain Coomer’s voice blasted out of the radio, telling the three platoon leaders to pull back or to mount up and hit them again.  Later, scuttlebutt had it that the Troop made thirteen assaults before the village was taken.  Some of the guys who were lightly wounded and dusted off early in the fight started to show up, and their stories were all grim.  One fellow from the first platoon told me Joe and Pop were both killed.  I don’t remember exactly what happened next, but I returned to my senses as a third platoon buck sergeant named Grimes pulled me off the poor guy who had given me the bad news.  I cried like a baby for what seemed like hours.
     Late that afternoon, I flew out to the Troop on one of the supply ships.  I found a few of the first platoon guys and got the first good news of the day.  While it was true that Pop had been killed, Joe was still alive when they loaded him onto a Dustoff ship.
     I can see now that I’ve forgotten to put down so much.  For example, Pop ate five pounds of pepperoni and sharp provolone cheese from one of my care packages.  We had to fumigate the damn track.  Or the time that he . . . . well, you get the idea.
     Joe and I reunited in 2005 for the reunion in Kansas City.  I stayed with him for five days, met his wife and kids, even went to church with him, and met the whole congregation.  We stayed up very late each night, reminiscing and swapping stories.     I told Joe about my wife, kids, and grandchildren.  My kids are my wife’s by her first husband, and when my first grandson started to talk, my daughter asked me if I wanted him to call me Pop Pop.  No, I told her, have them call me Pop.  Joe understood; every time one of the kids hollers for my attention, it’s a kind of tribute to the memory of Luther K. Page, Staff Sergeant, United States Army.
     I lost my wife suddenly last September.  Joe flew into Philadelphia and held my hand throughout the memorial service and reception.  He even brought me a small book that explained the grieving process.  It’s helped some, and Joe calls nearly once a week to check up on me.  So do the kids and the grandkids.  But mostly, it’s a lonely journey; time converts sharp pain into dull ache, and I guess that will fade someday.  But one of those funny things that happen in situations like these is when I start to drop off to sleep some nights, I can hear Pop’s voice.  He walks through the corridors of my mind and joins my wife there.  And just before sleep pulls me under, just before the dreams start, I can hear him clear as a bell, “You done good white boy, you done good.”

1n6jlpl,https://i.redd.it/yueijsgv7rmf1.jpeg,It’s okay to be sad,"Good morning to all my lovely acquaintances, 
Today I want to talk about something that’s been on my mind.first I want to take a moment to say that these are my opinions from years of experience. I am not a precessional psychologist,or therapist. But I want to reach out because after 16years of seeing a professional I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s okay to be sad. It’s okay to feel any general emotion because we are human. I’ve been dealing with sadness for a very long time. Always brushing off that crying and feeling things was a waist of energy…but that’s not true. I always believed that being numb was the only way I could live. But that’s not true. As I’ve learned over the years dysfunctional habits are not really encoded into our DNA. Having family with mental health issues doesn’t mean YOU yourself will be as mentally screwed up as they are. For years I’ve believed that all my flaws and imperfections made me a carbon copy of my family. I’ve lived with that fear of always worrying about what others think define my identity. But it’s not true. I’ve always asked what ifs instead of why…why couldn’t I be better? Why must I survive? Why didn’t anyone say something? Trauma has a way of creating a false narrative that something is wrong with you. You are the problem. But I tell you today and a wife and mother. It’s not true. There is nothing wrong with feeling the way you feel. Because at the end of the day..you are given a choice. The choice to pick a path that drives you forward. Sure you’ll always ask, did I do the right thing? Was it the right choice. That’s okay. There are no right or wrong answers. Because at the end of the day, no one can define who you are and what you will become. The best way to learn is by taking your experience and learn from it. My personal opinion may not matter to you and that’s okay. But never doubt yourself. Never hold your head low in order to keep others happy, never stand back and let others walk ahead. Because if you do then you will come to the conclusion that everything you did was wrong. I look at my child and see a carbon copy of myself. A beautiful soul full of life and wonder. I see the child i once was, full of inspiration and drive even though they are young. It inspires me to see that all my choices have brought me something. Right turns and wrong turns. I write this to my readers as to show you that what ever you feel inside, anger, sadness, happiness these are human emotions, really see and feel what you are feeling in the moment. Write that down and learn from it. There will always be trials, there will always be things that can’t be controlled. And that is okay. As I’m watching the sun rise, coffee in hand, and my morning cigarette. I thought someone needed to hear that what may or may not be on their minds. But it’s okay to feel the feelings. There is nothing wrong with you. You are perfectly imperfect. So my homework is for you to take this moment to write down what you are feeling and save it for when you feel the feelings again. And really listen to your past self. Even if it’s just a day ago, or years ago. What changed? And keep writing your word vomit until it’s all out. Then take a deep breath. And feel that weight lift. You are not surviving…you are finally living. ",2,1756820012.0,ThoughtsYouCanFeel,0,1.0,False

Hey fellow parents,

I’m in my 30s, married with kids, and looking for real friendships with other parents who are also surviving the daily circus — balancing home life, kids, marriage, and whatever chaos comes with it (seriously, why are my kids always hungry?).

A little about me:

I love to laugh, learn, and be a good friend.

Big anime fan (Studio Ghibli owns a piece of my soul).

Harry Potter nerd (books + movies checked off the list).

Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, all the classics.

Obsessed with action movies — Jackie Chan classics, and Jean-Claude Van Damme is my absolute favorite.


Basically, I’m looking for other parents over 30 who also need friends to vent with, laugh with, geek out over movies with, or just trade survival tips on how to get five minutes alone in the bathroom without a tiny human barging in.

A few weeks ago, I was driving through the outskirts of New Mexico, chasing the golden light of sunset across endless desert plains. My van, a slightly battered but trusty 15 Ford Transit, had been my home for almost a year now. I thought I knew it like the back of my hand. I parked near a small canyon, thinking it was an ideal spot: flat ground, some scrubby bushes for privacy, and a view that made my Instagram feed jealous.

By 9 PM, I was curled up with my journal, sipping instant coffee out of a chipped mug. Everything felt perfect until the wind started picking up. At first, it was just a little rustle of the branches, but then it turned into an angry howl. I could hear sand scratching against the van’s sides. My cozy little home felt suddenly exposed.

I tried to convince myself I was overreacting. But then my van’s old suspension groaned in protest, and I realized the slight incline I’d parked on wasn’t so slight after all. My van was slowly shifting. Panic started to creep in.

I grabbed my headlamp, hopped outside, and spent the next 20 minutes rearranging rocks, wedging logs under the tires, and praying that my van wasn’t about to become a rolling tumbleweed. By the time I got back inside, wind still roaring, I collapsed in my bed, heart racing but also laughing. I had learned two things: one, the van doesn’t care about my plans, and two, the road always has its own agenda.

The next morning, I woke up to absolute calm. Sunlight poured through the windows, and the canyon looked untouched, serene. I made breakfast on my tiny stove and reflected van life isn’t just about freedom or adventure. It’s about humility, respect for nature, and a willingness to adapt when the unexpected happens.

Since that night, I’ve started keeping a small lessons learned notebook in the van. Every tricky spot, unexpected storm, or mechanical hiccup gets written down. It’s become my little guidebook of survival and of appreciation for this mobile life I chose.

So here’s my question to you all  what’s the one lesson your van has taught you that no YouTube tutorial could ever cover? I’d love to hear your stories.",0,1756819781.0,VanLife,3,0.2,False

- She is also anxious. Attention from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement could upend her life more than 23 years after she illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border as a teenager.

- ""The worry is they'll pull you over when you're driving and ask for your papers,"" said Lidia, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition that only her first name be used because of her fears of deportation. ""We need to work. We need to feed our families and pay our rent.""

- As parades and other events celebrating the contributions of workers in the U.S. are held Monday for the Labor Day holiday, experts say President Donald Trump's stepped-up immigration policies are impacting the nation's labor force.

- More than 1.2 million immigrants disappeared from the labor force from January through the end of July, according to preliminary Census Bureau data analyzed by the Pew Research Center. That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.

- Immigrants make up almost 20% of the U.S. workforce and that data shows 45% of workers in farming, fishing and forestry are immigrants, according to Pew senior researcher Stephanie Kramer. About 30% of all construction workers are immigrants and 24% of service workers are immigrants, she added.

- The loss in immigrant workers comes as the nation is seeing the first decline in the overall immigrant population after the number of people in the U.S. illegally reached an all-time high of 14 million in 2023.

- ""It's unclear how much of the decline we've seen since January is due to voluntary departures to pursue other opportunities or avoid deportation, removals, underreporting or other technical issues,"" Kramer said. ""However, we don't believe that the preliminary numbers indicating net-negative migration are so far off that the decline isn't real.""

- Trump campaigned on a promise to deport millions of immigrants working in the U.S. illegally. He has said he is focusing deportation efforts on ""dangerous criminals,"" but most people detained by ICE have no criminal convictions. At the same time, the number of illegal border crossings has plunged under his policies.

- Pia Orrenius, a labor economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said immigrants normally contribute at least 50% of job growth in the U.S.

- ""The influx across the border from what we can tell is essentially stopped, and that's where we were getting millions and millions of migrants over the last four years,"" she said. ""That has had a huge impact on the ability to create jobs.""

- Just across the border from Mexico in McAllen, Texas, corn and cotton fields are about ready for harvesting. Elizabeth Rodriguez worries there won't be enough workers available for the gins and other machinery once the fields are cleared.

- Immigration enforcement actions at farms, businesses and construction sites brought everything to a standstill, said Rodriguez, director of farmworker advocacy for the National Farmworker Ministry.

- ""In May, during the peak of our watermelon and cantaloupe season, it delayed it. A lot of crops did go to waste,"" she said.

- In Ventura County, California, northwest of Los Angeles, Lisa Tate manages her family business that grows citrus fruits, avocados and coffee on eight ranches and 800 acres (323 hectares).

- Most of the men and women who work their farms are contractor-provided day laborers. There were days earlier this year when crews would be smaller. Tate is hesitant to place that blame on immigration policies. But the fear of ICE raids spread quickly.

- Dozens of area farmworkers were arrested late this spring

- ""People were being taken out of laundromats, off the side of the road,"" Tate said.

- Lidia, the farmworker who spoke to the AP through an interpreter, said her biggest fear is being sent back to Mexico. Now 36, she is married with three school-age children who were born here.

- ""I don't know if I'll be able to bring my kids,"" said Lidia. ""I'm also very concerned I'd have to start from zero. My whole life has been in the United States.""

- Construction sites in and around McAllen also ""are completely dead,"" Rodriguez said.

- ""We have a large labor force that is undocumented,"" she said. ""We've seen ICE particularly targeting construction sites and attempting to target mechanic and repair shops.""

- The number of construction jobs are down in about half of U.S. metropolitan areas, according to an Associated General Contractors of America analysis of government employment data. The largest loss of 7,200 jobs was in the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, California, area. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale area lost 6,200 jobs.

- ""Construction employment has stalled or retreated in many areas for a variety of reasons,"" said Ken Simonson, the association's chief economist. ""But contractors report they would hire more people if only they could find more qualified and willing workers and tougher immigration enforcement wasn't disrupting labor supplies.""

- Kramer, with Pew, also warns about the potential impact on health care. She says immigrants make up about 43% of home health care aides.

- The Service Employees International Union represents about 2 million workers in health care, the public sector and property services. An estimated half of long-term care workers who are members of SEIU 2015 in California are immigrants, said Arnulfo De La Cruz, the local's president.

- ""What's going to happen when millions of Americans can no longer find a home care provider?"" De La Cruz said. ""What happens when immigrants aren't in the field to pick our crops?

I’ve been getting deeper into espresso over the last 4–5 years, and I wanted to share my journey and ask for some advice on the next step.

I started out with an Illy X1 Anniversary (paid €230 for it back then, it’s €600+ today) not the most flexible machine, but it got me going. It kept me focused on beans and prep instead of obsessing over gear. For grinding, I used a Baratza Encore for a long time, which worked, but was limited.

A year ago, I upgraded to a Niche Zero and that was a *huge* difference. The grind consistency completely changed the game, and I also tightened up my workflow (WDT, tamping, etc.).

The main frustration I’m running into now is that my Illy X1 just feels too limiting. Shots often taste under-extracted, or sometimes barely extract at all. From what I’ve learned, that’s down to the 51 mm pressurized basket and the pump setup. It’s just not stable or consistent enough. It doesn’t deliver a steady 9 bar at the puck like a proper machine. That means my Niche Zero can’t really shine, because I’m fighting the machine instead of the coffee.

That’s why I’m considering the Linea Micra. I like the simplicity of my current setup: prep, push a button, enjoy. I’m not looking for levers or super manual machines, but something that’s high-end, reliable, and built to last. The Micra feels like the natural “serious but still home-friendly” upgrade. I’m also eyeing a 9Barista but more as a fun toy I could take on holiday than a main machine.

Sure, I could look at Sage/Breville or others in between, but my thought is: if I’m making the jump, I’d rather invest in something that will carry me for years.

So my question: Is the Linea Micra the right move here, or is there another machine with similar simplicity and longevity that I should consider (cheaper or not)?

Side note: I’m also a huge music fan, and this feels a lot like my audio journey. I always start by focusing on the source material, then slowly upgrade the gear step by step with speakers being the final piece. That’s how this upgrade feels: the espresso machine is the “last piece” that ties it all together.

Thanks for reading this far. Looking forward to your input.

Cheers!

1n6jb84,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPsychiatry/comments/1n6jb84/adhd_vs_depression_social_anxiety/,?ADHD vs ?Depression  + Social Anxiety,"Hi all, I’m a medical doctor (MBBS 2020) and I’ve been lost for years trying to understand my difficulties with memory, concentration, and functioning at work.

Since high school I’ve felt my memory and focus were poor — I barely made it through medical school. During internship I noticed I couldn’t recall or present cases I had looked after, and I was always on “autopilot mode.” Reading referral letters or case notes takes me 4–5 attempts before I understand them.

Career path:
	•	Internship → major struggles recalling patient details and organizing cases.

       •	Took 2 years off for exams (USMLE then UKMLA) but retention and concentration remained poor

	•	Clinical attachment abroad → 7 months as doctor’s assistant, then 4 months FY1 → dropped out because of difficulty reading notes, disorganization, brain fog, and social anxiety (especially during consultant rounds and MDTs ) leading to low mood.

Symptoms:
	•	Lifelong disorganization, poor working memory, “thought blocks,” difficulty planning 2 steps ahead and thoughts after actions.
	•	Often get lost in simple tasks (e.g., forgetting which floor I got out of in an elevator).
	•	Irritability, fatigue, and strong social anxiety.
	•	Never had patience for movies, tend to be talkative/impulsive.
	•	Coffee significantly improves concentration and alertness and social anxiety.
	•	Self-trial of methylphenidate (up to 50 mg/day) improved focus and reduced social anxiety, but caused palpitations and jitteriness. Lower doses (10–15 mg) felt ineffective.

Mood history:
	•	Two past major depressive episodes (last one >1 year ago). Currently no persistent low mood, but still struggling with motivation and cognitive “fog.”
	•	Tried multiple antidepressants: sertraline, fluoxetine, venlafaxine, vortioxetine, bupropion, escitalopram over 4-5 months. None improved my concentration or executive function.

I really felt I can’t live to my potential despite I am trying my best. I can’t even write a discharge summary properly from case notes and make a lot of careless mistakes. I have stopped studying because it doesn’t come without high dose caffeine and due to fatigue.

Background:
	•	Childhood bullying, family trauma, financial struggles.
	•	Stress/guilt related to caring for paralysed grandmother (fatigue, irritability, avoidance).

Main question:
👉 Could this pattern represent adult ADHD, depression-related cognitive impairment (“pseudo-dementia”), or both?
👉 Why do stimulants and caffeine help, while multiple antidepressants failed to improve my concentration, social anxiety? 

Also I don’t feel I am very impulsive or impulsive?
I am asking this because three psychiatrists I have seen does not think I have ADHD but i have to keep going to work because of my family.

I’ll be in Taipei for 5 nights and I’d love some suggestions for how best to spend my time. I’m already aware of some of the “classic” Taipei highlights (night markets, Taipei 101, National Palace Museum, Beitou hot springs, Maokong gondola, Elephant Mountain hike, etc.), but I’d really appreciate insights and any fresh recommendations from people who’ve been recently.

Im also curious about is New Taipei City.

Is it worth dedicating a day or half-day to exploring?

If so, which specific areas, neighborhoods, or attractions in New Taipei stand out?

Are there unique things to do there that are different from Taipei?

1n6jb0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ProofYam1967/comments/1n6jb0u/in_the_last_rainfall/,In the Last Rainfall,"Rain poured steadily over the rusted roof of the old family home, creating a familiar rhythm that had always lulled her into remembering. Not too heavy, not too light. Just enough to make the world slow down.

Rio curled up by the window, her knees drawn close, a warm blanket draped over her shoulders. In her hands, the green mug she never stopped using, the one her Papa gave her on his last Christmas. It had the words *Not Your Average* printed in bold letters, now faded from too many dishwashing cycles.

*Hindi naman siya espesyal,* she once joked to her dad.  
*Pero hindi ka rin pangkaraniwan, anak,* he replied. *Kaya bagay sa’yo.*

It was 2025 now. But inside this house, this memory, it was always 2017.

The year everything changed.

That was the year Papa got sick. The year hospitals became home. The year she met Eli.

She still remembered the first time she saw him standing in line at the Hospital's counter, frustrated, tired, clutching documents with one hand and a bottled water in the other. They both laughed at the absurdity of public health paperwork. They bonded over grief, over waiting rooms, over the sound of machines that told you if a life was still there or slowly slipping away.

Rio didn't believe in destiny. But Eli made her believe in small salvations.

He was kind. Quiet. Always bringing coffee he couldn't afford and jokes he barely had energy to tell. And in the middle of all the loss, he made her feel alive.

They became each other’s escape.

They wrote a quiet love story between hospital visits and bus rides. They had no anniversaries, no grand gestures, just *presence,* and in those moments, it was enough.

*“Hindi naman mahalaga kung kailan tayo nagsimula,”* Eli said, eyes fixed on the distance, as if searching for the right words somewhere out there.  
*“Wala naman sigurong tamang oras para sa ganitong klaseng kwento. Ang mahalaga, heto tayo ikaw at ako.”*

But real life is cruel to love that blooms in survival mode.

Things began to shift. Her grief turned into ambition. She wanted to leave, to study abroad, maybe just start fresh somewhere Papa never walked. Eli, on the other hand, was rooted. Tied to a younger sibling, to debts, to the kind of life that didn’t allow running.

They didn’t fight. That was the problem.

They just... *faded*.  
Like a song that stopped playing.  
Like a coffee that went cold while you stared out the window.

Then the pandemic came and with it, silence. Messages unread. Calls unanswered. And eventually, a photo of Eli on Social media, smiling beside someone new.

No anger. No tears. Just that strange silence that comes when something inside finally gives way.

She just closed her laptop, poured herself coffee in the same green mug, and whispered, *“Congrats""*

Now, in the stillness of the rainy morning, back in her childhood home, Rio allowed herself to feel it all again.

The love.  
The loss.  
The way those memories held the kind of pain that shapes her and the kind of love that doesn’t need forever to be real.

She took a sip, bitter and warm.

*“Papa,”* she murmured, *“ang dami kong gustong ikuwento!""*

And outside, the rain kept falling.  
Not too heavy, not too light.  
Just enough to carry her back to love, to goodbye, to the girl she used to be.",1,1756819275.0,u_ProofYam1967,0,1.0,False

**When you're low, routines can feel like pressure.**  
And if you're navigating depression, even basic structure might feel out of reach.

But I want you to know that you're not lazy and you're not failing. Your body is in a survival state, and it makes sense that the usual productivity advice just doesn’t land right now.

✨ This is where *rhythms* come in.  
Rhythms are gentler than routines.  
They don’t demand, they invite.  
They’re not about performance, they’re about presence.

**Here’s the difference:**  
🧠 Routines say: “Stick to this plan or you’ve messed up.”  
🫀 Rhythms say: “Let’s try this one small thing… again and again, in your own time.”

💡 *Why rhythms work:*  
Your nervous system thrives on [**predictable**](https://www.lifebydesigntherapy.com/)**,** [**body-based signals**](https://www.lifebydesigntherapy.com/) **of safety**.

Simple things like drinking water before coffee, opening a window, or lighting a candle at the same time each night…

They tell your body: *“You’re safe now. You can settle.”*

🌿 Here are a few more gentle rhythm ideas to try:  
✨ Opening a window in the morning  
✨ Drinking water before coffee  
✨ Playing the same calming song while brushing your teeth  
✨ Lighting a candle at night  
✨ Doing one small stretch before getting into bed

Not all of these will feel right, and that’s okay. The goal isn’t perfection. The goal is consistency with kindness.

Healing doesn’t start with motivation.  
It starts with safety.  
And often, that safety comes from doing one small thing, again and again, until your body begins to trust that it’s okay to stay.

🌀 Rhythm regulates. Your nervous system responds to patterns, not pressure.

*Unlocking the mindset that separates achievers from dreamers*

---

## The Hidden Psychology Behind Excellence 🎯

Ever wondered why some people seem to effortlessly climb mountains while others struggle with molehills? The answer isn't talent, luck, or even hard work alone. It's a specific mental framework that elite performers use to navigate challenges and accelerate their growth.

This psychological approach involves a fascinating paradox: being simultaneously humble and confident, modest yet bold. It's about knowing when to doubt yourself and when to trust your abilities completely.

## The Two-Sided Coin of Peak Performance 🪙

### Side One: Embracing Your Knowledge Gaps 🕳️

The most successful people have a remarkable relationship with ignorance. Instead of pretending to know everything, they:

- **Openly acknowledge what they don't understand** - This isn't weakness; it's intelligence
- **Ask questions without ego** - They prioritize learning over looking smart
- **Admit mistakes quickly** - Rather than defending errors, they extract lessons
- **Seek out areas where they're weakest** - They hunt for blind spots like treasure hunters

This mindset prevents the dangerous trap of false confidence. When you pretend to know more than you do, you stop learning. When you accept your limitations, you create space for growth.

### Side Two: Unshakeable Faith in Your Learning Power ⚡

Here's where the magic happens. While being humble about current knowledge, top performers maintain absolute confidence in their ability to acquire new skills and solve problems. They believe:

- **Any skill can be learned with proper effort** - Nothing is permanently beyond reach
- **Challenges are puzzles, not roadblocks** - Every problem has a solution waiting to be discovered
- **Setbacks are data, not defeats** - Failures provide valuable information for the next attempt
- **Time and persistence trump initial talent** - Effort compounds over time

## Real-World Applications: Making This Work for You 🛠️

### In Your Career 💼

**When facing a new project:**
- Start by mapping out everything you don't know about the task
- Create a learning plan to fill those gaps
- Maintain confidence that you'll figure it out step by step
- Break complex challenges into manageable pieces

**Example:** A marketing professional assigned to launch a social media campaign for a completely new industry might say: ""I don't understand this market yet, but I'm excellent at researching audiences and testing messaging strategies.""

### In Personal Development 📈

**When learning new skills:**
- Acknowledge you're a beginner without shame
- Trust that consistent practice will yield results
- Focus on the process, not immediate perfection
- Celebrate small wins along the journey

**Example:** Someone starting to learn guitar might think: ""I can barely play three chords right now, but I have a track record of mastering complex things when I commit to them.""

### In Relationships 💫

**When conflicts arise:**
- Admit when you don't fully understand the other person's perspective
- Remain confident in your ability to work through disagreements
- Approach conversations as learning opportunities
- Trust that mutual understanding is achievable

### In Financial Growth 💰

**When building wealth:**
- Be honest about your current financial knowledge gaps
- Maintain confidence in your ability to learn smart money management
- Start with small, manageable steps
- Trust the compound effect of consistent good decisions

## The Science Behind This Approach 🔬

Research in psychology shows that this dual mindset activates several powerful mental processes:

**Growth Mindset Activation:** Believing abilities can be developed encourages persistence and resilience.

**Reduced Cognitive Bias:** Acknowledging ignorance helps avoid overconfidence traps that lead to poor decisions.

**Enhanced Learning:** Intellectual humility creates openness to new information and feedback.

**Stress Resilience:** Confidence in your adaptation ability reduces anxiety about unknown challenges.

## Daily Practices to Develop Strategic Confidence 🌱

### Morning Ritual 🌅
Start each day by identifying:
1. One thing you don't know but need to learn
2. One challenge you're confident you can solve
3. One small action you'll take toward both

### Weekly Review 📅
Every week, ask yourself:
- What did I learn that I didn't know before?
- What problem did I solve that initially seemed difficult?
- Where did my confidence in my abilities pay off?
- What new areas of ignorance did I discover?

### The ""I Don't Know"" Challenge 🤔
Practice saying ""I don't know"" followed immediately by ""but I can find out."" This trains your brain to see knowledge gaps as opportunities rather than weaknesses.

### Problem-Solving Confidence Building 💪
Deliberately take on small challenges slightly outside your comfort zone. Each success builds evidence for your ability to figure things out.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid ⚠️

**The Impostor Trap:** Feeling like a fraud when you don't know something. Remember: not knowing everything is normal and healthy.

**The Overconfidence Error:** Believing you can figure anything out instantly. Learning takes time and effort.

**The Perfectionist Paralysis:** Waiting until you know enough to start. You learn by doing, not by preparing.

**The Comparison Game:** Measuring your knowledge gaps against others' apparent expertise. Everyone has blind spots.

## Building Your Strategic Confidence Toolkit 🧰

### For Knowledge Assessment:
- Regular skill audits
- Feedback collection systems
- Learning goal tracking
- Knowledge gap mapping

### For Confidence Building:
- Success story documentation
- Challenge completion tracking
- Problem-solving process records
- Adaptation capability evidence

### For Balanced Perspective:
- Mentorship relationships
- Peer learning groups
- Regular reality checks
- Humble confidence reminders

## The Long-Term Advantage 📊

People who master this mindset create a significant competitive advantage over time. While others either remain stuck in their comfort zones or burn out from overconfident mistakes, strategic confidence practitioners:

- **Continuously expand their capabilities** without being overwhelmed by the learning curve
- **Take on bigger challenges** with appropriate preparation and realistic timelines
- **Recover faster from setbacks** because they expect and plan for learning curves
- **Build stronger relationships** through authentic communication about strengths and limitations

## The Ripple Effect 🌊

This approach doesn't just benefit you personally. It creates positive impacts in every area of your life:

**At Work:** Teams become more innovative when members can admit knowledge gaps and trust collective problem-solving abilities.

**In Families:** Children learn healthy attitudes toward learning and challenge when they see adults model strategic confidence.

**In Communities:** Groups become more resilient when members combine intellectual humility with solution-oriented thinking.

## Your Next Steps Forward 👣

Starting tomorrow, you can begin developing this powerful mindset:

1. **Identify one area where you've been pretending to know more than you do** - What topic would benefit from honest ignorance acknowledgment?

2. **Choose one challenge that currently seems overwhelming** - How can you break it down and apply your problem-solving confidence?

3. **Practice the humble-confident language** - Begin using phrases like ""I don't know that yet, but I'm good at figuring things out.""

4. **Document your learning wins** - Keep track of times when your ability to adapt and learn paid off.

## The Time-Tested Truth 🕰️

Throughout history, the people who've made the biggest differences have shared this psychological profile. They've combined intellectual humility with unshakeable confidence in human learning capacity. This isn't about ego or false bravado - it's about realistic optimism grounded in evidence of your own adaptability.

Whether you're 25 or 65, starting a new career or mastering a hobby, facing relationship challenges or building wealth, this mindset framework provides a sustainable approach to growth and achievement.

The most exciting part? You probably already have evidence of this working in your life. Think about complex things you've learned, problems you've solved, and challenges you've overcome. That track record is proof of your adaptation abilities.

Now it's time to consciously apply this strategic confidence to whatever mountains you want to climb next. 🏔️

Remember: You don't need to know everything. You just need to trust your ability to learn anything.

1n6j9os,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1n6j9os/can_afuncrafter_cord_organizer_transform_kitchen/,Can AFunCrafter Cord Organizer Transform Kitchen Appliance Management? Detailed Review Here!,"I've been testing the AFunCrafter Cord Organizer, model Cord Organizer, and it’s been quite an interesting experience. As someone who’s constantly battling the chaos of a cluttered countertop, this little gadget promised to be a savior. Designed to manage cords for kitchen appliances like mixers, coffee makers, and air fryers, it seemed like just the thing I needed in my home. However, while it does deliver on many of its promises, there are aspects worth discussing for anyone considering adding it to their kitchen arsenal.

**Build Quality and Design**  
The blend of simplicity and functionality in the design is undeniable. Made from premium silicone, the material feels flexible yet sturdy enough to wrap around curved appliance surfaces. It’s soft to the touch, which is ideal to prevent scratching your appliances, and the black, grey, and white color options blend seamlessly without looking out of place in modern kitchens. Measuring 4.05 inches in length and 1.1 inches in width, it’s compact, but surprisingly effective at supporting even bulkier power cords. I even tried it on my mixer first, which has a notoriously thick cord, and it held everything in place nicely. Kudos to that strong adhesive backing, but, oh, more about it later.  

[Check AFunCrafter Cord Organizer price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0b9ggfnlb/)

**Functionality and Usability**  
At first, I wasn’t sure it would make that big a difference, but after just a day of using it, I couldn’t stop myself from reorganizing every appliance cord in sight. These cord winders are exceptionally easy to use—they stick on almost any smooth surface, and once positioned, you can neatly wrap the cords around. They support appliances ranging from my air fryer to my coffee maker without any issues. Wrapping up was smooth, no tangling or awkward bends. Plus, they boast heat resistance up to 158°F, so I wasn’t worried using them for devices that emit heat either. It's amazing how such a tiny gadget can declutter not only your space but also your mind when you don't see messy wires.

**Key Benefits**  
Some standout positives for me were:  
- The upgraded adhesive that stays firmly in place without peeling off.  
- Made for small kitchen appliances but adaptable enough for other uses (think desk cables too!).  
- The silicone material doesn’t crack or degrade over time, ensuring longevity.

**Potential Drawbacks**  
While I found it useful overall, there were a few snags you might want to be aware of:  
- The adhesive is strong, almost too strong! Once stuck, repositioning is virtually impossible without damaging the glue.  
- It didn’t adhere well to textured surfaces—it’s smooth surfaces or bust here.  
- The cord holder in the center is designed larger for some plugs, which might cause thinner cords to feel slightly loose.  

**Ease of Installation**  
Putting these on my appliances was super simple. You peel off the adhesive backing, press it onto a clean surface, and let the magic happen. It’s important to clean the area thoroughly before applying though; the adhesive doesn’t work well if there’s any grease or debris left.

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other cord organizers I’ve tried, the AFunCrafter Cord Organizer has clear advantages. For instance, similar products often use weaker adhesives, requiring constant reapplication or replacement. Others don’t handle curved surfaces well, and some are more rigid, which can damage the cords. However, competitor options like Cord Wrapper Pro come with adjustable adhesive pads, letting you relocate them if needed. That’s an area where this product lags behind—it’s more of a one-and-done kind of mounting. Still, with its flexible silicone build and heat resistance, it outpaces rivals on durability.

**Value for Money**  
Is this cord organizer worth it? I would say yes, for most people dealing with cable messes. Its price falls in the accessible range, making it a solid choice for maintaining a tidy kitchen without overspending. Considering the durability and the multipurpose application, it definitely offers bang for the buck. If you have multiple appliances, the three-piece set ensures you're covered.

""Go home and think it over. I hope this is the last time you make a fuss,"" he said. 
For Rosalie Harris, he abandoned Josie repeatedly, humiliating her. 
Laurence believed Josie couldn't survive without him. 
He didn't know Rosalie's brother was secretly encouraging Josie to divorce and leave the country. 
... 

""We should get a divorce,"" Josie said. She stared out at the storm, asking Laurence for a divorce for the ninety-ninth time. 

Rain battered the windows, as relentless as the despair in her heart. 

She learned a month ago that Laurence saw her as a stand-in for Rosalie. 

Three years of marriage, all the sweetness, turned to nothing. 

Her phone lit up with a message. ""Josie, has he agreed to the divorce? Is a plane ticket for a week from now okay?""

The one urging her to leave was Chris Harris, Rosalie's older brother. 

She knew Chris had feelings for her. If she wanted to escape Laurence, he was the one who would help. 

Laurence didn't look at her. He just gripped the steering wheel tighter. ""Stop it. I don't have time for this,"" he said. 

She turned to him. The car was dim, her face pale, her eyes hollow as she watched him. 

This time, she didn't cry or argue. She was eerily calm. 

Laurence grew irritated under her gaze. He pressed the gas, and the car sped through the rain. ""I told you Rosalie is just an old friend. Stop being paranoid.""

He added impatiently, ""I'll cover your dad's next surgery and buy you five new bags.""

His tone was like he was dismissing a clueless subordinate. 

She thought she was numb by now. 

But Laurence's words still cut her deeply. 

A cheerful violin ringtone broke the silence. 

It was Rosalie's special ringtone. 

His cold face softened instantly. 

Laurence slowed the car and pulled over smoothly. ""Rosalie, don't worry. I'm coming right now,"" he said. 

In three years of marriage, Josie never even had her own ringtone. 

He hung up, and the warmth vanished. ""Rosalie needs me. Go home.""

Laurence kicked her out of the car like it was nothing. 

He opened the door, letting the storm pour in. 

""Go home and think it over. I hope this is the last time you make a fuss,"" he said. 

He didn't even leave her an umbrella. 

The Maybach sped off, splashing water onto her skirt. 

She pulled a folding umbrella from her bag and opened it, watching the car disappear into traffic. 

She let the cold rain hit her face, hoping it would wake her up. 

Memories flooded back. 

Years ago, when she faced dropping out, Laurence's grandmother anonymously funded her education. 

To repay her, when she was ill and wanted to see Laurence married, Josie agreed to the marriage. 

Laurence and Josie had an arrangement. She played the perfect wife to ease his grandmother's mind, and he supported her and her sick father. 

She became Laurence's all-purpose secretary. Their marriage started without love. 

But Laurence gave her a dangerously perfect beginning. 

He'd go to an old diner in a back alley, waiting in line forever, just to get her a late-night soup. 

He remembered her period, always ready with hot cocoa and a heating pad. 

Laurence even tore up his outdoor garden to build a greenhouse for her, filled with flowers he planted himself. 

He patiently watched artsy movies with her, clumsily handing her tissues when she cried. 

Those small acts of care wove a tight net, trapping her. 

She fell hard, loving this man who was cold to everyone but special to her. 

Then, a month ago, Rosalie returned. 

Chris sent her a message saying she was Rosalie's stand-in. 

She found a locked photo album in Laurence's study. 

The password was Rosalie's birthday. 

Inside were photos of Rosalie, from her awkward school days to her elegant adulthood, each carefully preserved. 

The album's edges were worn, flipped through countless times. 

In one photo, a teenage Rosalie wore a white dress, holding a violin, her smile bright and bold. 

Laurence once bought Josie the same dress, saying it suited her. 

Notes under the photos listed Rosalie's preferences. 

""Rosalie loves soup from the south side diner. 

Rosalie gets cramps and needs hot cocoa. 

Rosalie loves flowers, especially peonies. 

Rosalie loves artsy movies.""

... 

Every detail matched how Laurence treated Josie. 

In that moment, she knew. 

A prince wouldn't fall for a nobody. 

In reality, princes would end up with princesses. 

Rosalie had been abroad for treatment, and Laurence's grandmother couldn't wait. 

Josie showed up at the right time, with eyes and a vibe vaguely like Rosalie's. 

Laurence shaped her into a perfect copy of Rosalie, based on her likes. 

Now the real Rosalie was back. 

Josie, the flawed imitation, had to go. 

Her phone lit up. Chris. ""He refused again?""

She replied. ""Yeah, but I have a plan. Book the ticket for a week from now.""

Chris responded instantly. ""I'll come to Bayside to get you in a week. That okay?""

""Fine, if it's not too much trouble,"" she said. 

She deleted the chat and walked into the rain. 

Chris had been abroad for two years. He'd have to fly ten hours to pick her up, then ten more to take her back. 

After betrayal, she didn't trust men's kindness. 

She was just using Chris's feelings for her. 

Karma worked in circles. The man she wanted to escape loved Rosalie, but the one helping her escape was Rosalie's brother. 

Chapter 2
Josie returned home soaked, stepping into the bedroom. 

She opened the closet, filled with clothes Laurence had bought her. 

Every piece was expensive and beautiful, but none matched Josie's true style. 

She preferred bright colors and lively designs that made her feel vibrant. 

But Laurence said she looked best in muted dresses, more elegant. 

Now Josie understood why--because it was Rosalie's style. 

She pulled out her suitcase and began packing her things. 

Laurence only noticed the clothes and items that mimicked Rosalie. 

Three years of marriage left Josie with few personal belongings, easily fitting into one suitcase. 

Her phone buzzed with a message from Chris. ""Josie, I've arranged an invitation to Eldoria Fashion Academy and an apartment for you.""

Eldoria had been Josie's dream since childhood. 

She loved fashion design and wanted to make it big there. 

But after marrying Laurence, she gave up that dream to become his personal secretary. 

Josie hadn't expected Chris to go this far for her. 

He'd even secured a job and a place to live. 

Knowing he was Rosalie's brother, she accepted without hesitation. 

What could be more satisfying than Rosalie thinking she'd won, only for Josie to turn around and charm her brother, maybe even become her sister-in-law? 

Whether she'd actually become Rosalie's sister-in-law, she'd decide after leaving the country. 

For now, it was time to reclaim her own life. 

Her phone pinged again. Chris sent a photo. 

Josie opened it, seeing the apartment's interior. 

In the center stood a handsome, refined man, bathed in sunlight, his figure glowing with a golden sheen that drew the eye. 

The photo was clearly staged by Chris. 

If he only wanted her to see the apartment, he could've taken it himself. 

This was just a way to make sure Josie saw him. 

At midnight, Laurence finally came home. 

He carried a faint jasmine scent, not his usual cologne. 

Josie didn't need to guess--it was Rosalie's perfume. 

He seemed in a good mood, a gentle smile lingering on his face. 

""Still up?"" Laurence asked, loosening his tie. 

""Waiting for you,"" Josie replied. 

She didn't help him like she usually did. 

""I was foolish before. I won't mention divorce again,"" she said. 

Laurence paused, surprised. ""Really?""

""Really,"" Josie said, her eyes innocent. ""I realized marriage doesn't need love. As long as we respect each other and get what we need, that's enough.""

Laurence heard the answer he wanted, but felt no joy. 

He frowned. ""I married you, so I won't abandon you easily. Rosalie's just been abroad for years and isn't well. She needs my help.""

Josie smiled faintly, not arguing. 

What was Laurence thinking? She'd asked for a divorce ninety-nine times to make way for Rosalie, but he refused. 

Now she suggested returning to a marriage of convenience, letting him pursue Rosalie openly. 

Yet he claimed she misunderstood his relationship with Rosalie. 

Did he think she was st**id? 

Rosalie had her own family--why would she need him to care for her? 

Was it because Josie knew about his company's confidential projects, and he feared she'd leak them? 

Was that why he wouldn't let her go easily? 

Laurence stepped closer, displeased. ""You don't believe me? Let's skip protection tonight and try for a kid.""

Josie was stunned. ""You…"" Was he out of his mind? 

Luckily, Rosalie's call interrupted. 

Laurence answered, chatting briefly before explaining an investment project to her in detail. 

Josie handed him the meeting documents she'd prepared. 

This was their usual work routine. 

Laurence glanced at the first page, saw nothing unusual, and signed while talking on the phone. 

Josie showed only the last pages. ""Here, here, and here, you need to sign.""

Her heart pounded, but she kept her face neutral, flipping pages quickly. 

Laurence's focus was on the call. He signed rapidly, not noticing one page was titled ""Divorce Agreement.""

Josie watched him sign, a weight lifting from her heart. 

Tomorrow, she'd submit the divorce agreement to the lawyer. In seven days, she'd be free. 

Chapter 3
Josie went to work at the company as usual. 

To avoid arousing Laurence's suspicion, she planned to perform her secretarial duties perfectly in her final days. 

She stopped short at the door of the president's office. 

The door was slightly ajar, and Rosalie was laughing, leaning her head on Laurence's shoulder. 

Her body practically draped over him. 

Laurence looked down at Rosalie, his eyes filled with an indulgence Josie had never seen. 

Josie pushed the door open, and both turned to look at her. 

Rosalie shook Laurence's arm and said, ""Is that your secretary? Get me a hand-brewed coffee.""

Her tone was like giving orders to a household servant. 

The possessiveness in her voice was unmistakable. 

Laurence hesitated, unsure how to explain, but Josie responded calmly, ""Sure, just a moment.""

With the divorce agreement in hand, she was merely his secretary now. 

In the break room, the aroma of grinding coffee beans filled the air. 

Josie focused on each step, her head lowered. 

She recalled a note from the photo album: Rosalie likes Yirgacheffe with a hint of fruity acidity. 

No wonder Laurence's office always had Yirgacheffe beans. 

To match his ""preference,"" Josie had grown accustomed to the fruity tang. 

Her life, tastes, and habits had been quietly molded into another woman's image. 

The steam from the coffee misted Josie's eyes, but she didn't cry. 

Her heart had gone cold, and tears no longer came. 

Josie carried the tray steadily toward the office. 

As she approached the sofa, Rosalie, who had been sitting, suddenly stood up as if to meet her but stumbled, crashing into Josie. 

""Oh no!"" Rosalie exclaimed. 

The tray tilted, and a full cup of scalding coffee splashed onto the back of Josie's right hand. 

A sharp, burning pain hit instantly. 

Josie stifled a gr**n, instinctively pulling her hand back as it visibly reddened and swelled. 

Laurence immediately yanked Rosalie behind him. ""Rosalie, are you burned?""

Rosalie hid in his arms, her eyes teary. ""I didn't mean it. Your secretary walked too fast, and I didn't see her coming.""

Only then did Laurence glance at Josie, who was hunched over, her fingers trembling from pain. 

""How could you be so careless?"" he snapped, seemingly blind to her red, swollen hand. ""What are you standing there for? Go take care of it!""

In that moment, Josie's heart felt as if it had been doused with the scalding coffee and then thrown into an icebox. 

She said nothing and turned to the bathroom. 

Cold water rushed over her hand, the pain searing, but it paled compared to the chill in her heart. 

Laurence knew her hands were vital to her. 

When she wasn't working, she practiced sketching fashion designs at home, and he'd even found resources for her. 

If he'd paid attention, he'd have seen Rosalie's stumble was deliberate. 

Rosalie knew Josie wasn't just a secretary but Laurence's wife. 

Yet she acted anyway, banking on Laurence's affection for her. 

This hand…

Josie needed it to draw fashion sketches and chase her dreams in Eldoria. 

If Rosalie dared to cross that line, Josie wouldn't hold back. 

She looked up at the mirror, seeing a woman radiating newfound resolve and freedom. 

Back at her desk, Josie placed her burned hand on a copy of the divorce agreement, snapped a photo, and sent it to Chris. ""Chris, I've got the signed divorce agreement. It's with the lawyer now. Everything's on track.""

Chapter 4
Chris replied instantly. ""What happened to your hand?""

Josie Watson smirked. ""Just a coffee-making mishap for someone else. By the way, your sister's at Laurence's company. Is your family working on a new project with him?""

Chris was sharp and caught her meaning. ""No collaboration. Rosalie's been abroad these three years, not studying, just dating and partying.""

""What? Doesn't she like Laurence?"" Josie asked. 

""She likes him a bit, I guess. She's had dozens of boyfriends, traveled the world, and now she's back, ready to settle down,"" Chris replied. 

Josie hadn't expected Chris to spill so much about Rosalie. 

Laurence thought Rosalie had been abroad for treatment. 

But her world travels proved she'd been faking illness. 

She'd hidden it from Laurence to play the field while keeping him as a fallback. 

Poor Laurence, treasuring her every word and action. 

Little did he know, she'd fooled him for three years, treating him like a safety net. 

With this explosive information, Josie didn't plan to expose Rosalie yet. 

She wanted Laurence to learn the truth after she left. 

She pocketed her phone and returned to the office as if nothing had happened. 

Laurence and Rosalie were laughing together. 

The earlier incident seemed forgotten. 

Laurence's glance caught the bandage on Josie's hand. 

He didn't even frown. ""Clean up the coffee stain on the floor,"" he said. 

Josie nodded obediently. ""Yes, Mr. Andrews.""

Rosalie covered her mouth, smiling smugly. ""Sorry, Josie. Should I clean it instead?""

She stepped closer to Josie, lowering her voice. ""Your hand is so pretty. Better protect it. Or how will you draw your designs?""

Rosalie knew everything. 

She knew Josie dreamed of fashion design and how vital her hands were. 

That's why she'd deliberately scalded her. 

Josie met her gaze, her eyes cold. 

The chill in her stare made Rosalie flinch. 

Laurence, hearing Rosalie's words, thought she was kind and thoughtful. 

""Rosalie's just being sweet,"" he said to Josie. ""Get the cleaners to handle it.""

Josie found it laughable. 

Laurence was blind in both eyes and heart. 

That evening, Laurence didn't stay with Rosalie and returned to the villa. 

He tossed Josie a velvet box. ""There's a charity gala tomorrow night. Get ready. You're coming with me.""

Josie opened the box to find a dazzling diamond necklace. 

Laurence, seeing her lack of reaction, grew impatient. ""You've been sensible lately. This is your reward.""

Sensible? 

Did he mean her politeness to Rosalie earlier? 

Josie laughed coldly inside. 

""Got it,"" she said calmly, accepting the necklace. 

She treated it as his final severance payment. 

The next day, as Josie prepared to change into her gown, her phone rang. 

It was her father's doctor. ""Miss Watson, your father's next surgery payment is due.""

Josie's heart sank. 

Laurence had promised that morning to cover the medical fees. 

She dialed his number immediately. 

It rang for a long time before he picked up. 

Rosalie's saccharine voice came through. ""Is that Josie? Hi! Laurence is helping me pick a gown for the gala. What's up?""

Josie gripped her phone tightly. ""Put Laurence on.""

After a moment, Laurence's irritated voice came through. ""What is it? I'm busy.""

""My dad's medical fees. You promised,"" Josie said. 

""I know. I'll transfer it later,"" he replied. 

""No, you can't…"" Josie started, but Laurence cut her off. ""Rosalie's attending the gala tonight. Take a cab and get there yourself.""

He hung up without giving her a chance to respond. 

The busy tone echoed in Josie's ears, panic rising. 

Laurence was always meticulous, never delaying. 

Only Rosalie could make him break a promise. 

She must have deliberately stopped him from helping. 

If Josie's father faced delays because of money and something went wrong, the betrayal would ensure Josie and Laurence could never stay married. 

Josie sensed something off. Rosalie had only been back two days but was already targeting her repeatedly. 

It felt like Rosalie was racing to ruin Josie's relationship with Laurence. 

Josie opened her chat with Chris. ""Chris, can you lend me five hundred thousand? Laurence suddenly won't pay my dad's medical fees. I've got two hundred thousand, but I'm short fifty.""

Despite the time difference, Chris replied instantly. ""Don't worry, Josie. I'll transfer it now. But I have a better idea. Why not move your father to a hospital abroad? That way, you'll have no ties when you leave. I can cover the costs for now.""

Josie knew taking her father abroad would be better but far more expensive. 

Sensing her hesitation, Chris dangled another offer. ""Those design sketches you sent me? I've found a buyer. Trust me, Josie, you're talented enough to earn plenty to treat your father. Laurence has been holding you back.""

An unknown designer's work wouldn't sell easily. 

Josie knew Chris must have pulled strings. 

Thinking of Rosalie's cruelty, she didn't hesitate. ""Chris, you're right. I don't know how I'll ever thank you.""

""Josie, all I want is for you not to push me away.""

Chapter 5
Chris's five hundred thousand arrived quickly. 

Josie added her own savings, gathered the full amount, and sent it to the hospital immediately. 

With her father's care secured, she had no more worries. 

She wished time would move faster. 

Josie turned to the walk-in closet. 

The gala gown Laurence had chosen for her hung there, a white long dress. 

It was Rosalie's style, as always. 

Josie ignored it and dug through the closet's depths, pulling out a bold red backless gown. 

It was a dress Laurence's grandmother had arranged for her when she first married. 

Vibrant and defiant, it pulsed with life. 

It was her. 

The gala was held at Bayside's most luxurious hotel. 

Josie arrived by cab, but a server stopped her at the entrance. ""Ma'am, please show your invitation.""

Josie froze. She'd always attended with Laurence and had forgotten galas required personal invitations. 

Invitations were sent for couples, not anticipating a wife arriving alone. 

She stepped back, reaching for her phone to call Laurence. 

A few wealthy women passed by, their eyes dripping with disdain. 

""Another woman trying to sneak in to snag a rich guy,"" one said. 

""Wearing last season's style. Probably some D-list actress,"" another Ascot another. 

""I've seen her type before. No real talent, just banking on their looks for a come-up.""

Their sharp words made Josie's face flush. 

She gripped her purse tightly, the sting of their remarks cutting deep. 

A commotion stirred nearby. 

The crowd parted, flashbulbs popping. 

Laurence had arrived. 

He wore a tailored black suit, standing tall and commanding. 

Rosalie shimmered in a white diamond-encrusted gown, glowing under the lights. 

She clung to Laurence with a sweet smile, posing for the cameras. 

They looked perfect together, a match made in heaven. 

Josie stood at the crowd's edge, an outsider in this glittering world. 

She watched her husband play the doting partner to another woman. 

Laurence's gaze swept over, catching the bold red of her dress. His brow furrowed. 

He let go of Rosalie and strode toward Josie. 

Rosalie's face tightened as he walked away. 

""Why are you dressed like that?"" Laurence asked, his tone thick with reproach. 

His eyes flicked to her bare neck. ""And where's the necklace I gave you?""

Josie's expression stayed cool. ""Wearing it or not is my choice.""

Rosalie caught up, muttering softly, ""Laurence, doesn't she know you hate red? And that old dress? It's like she's trying to embarrass you.""

Laurence's look turned colder, his disgust clear. ""Forget her. Let's go inside,"" he said. 

With a darkened face, Laurence held Rosalie and brushed past Josie. 

He handed the server their invitation, and the server bowed. ""Welcome, Mr. and Mrs. Andrews.""

Rosalie handed over her own invitation. ""You got it wrong. Mrs. Andrews is the one in red back there.""

All eyes turned to Josie. 

The CEO was cozying up to another woman, leaving his wife behind. 

Cameras clicked furiously, capturing the trio's awkward positions and expressions. 

The mi**ress wore a million-dollar couture gown, while Mrs. Andrews sported an outdated dress. 

Was a divorce looming for the Andrews family? 

Josie's flushed face paled under the flashing lights. 

The server's rejection and the women's insults paled compared to Laurence's indifference. 

Her scarred heart, torn open again, bled anew. 

Ten minutes later, Josie composed herself in the restroom, touched up her lipstick, and returned to the banquet hall. 

A few familiar women approached her. 

""Mrs. Andrews, you look stunning! That red dress suits you perfectly,"" one said. 

Josie smiled graciously, engaging them in polite conversation. 

Her elegance and poise shone as she navigated the crowd with ease. 

Laurence stood nearby, watching his familiar yet distant wife, a strange irritation rising within him. 

Josie had always loved the gifts he gave her. 

Her eyes used to hold admiration when she looked at him. 

But these past few days--since she first mentioned divorce--that light seemed to fade. 

Was she jealous of Rosalie? 

That thought erased Laurence's unease. 

Josie was just using divorce talk to get his attention. 

Her father needed his money, and she was love-struck for him. She'd never leave. 

""Rosalie, the gala's starting. I need to join my wife,"" Laurence said. 

He grabbed a w**e glass, wove through the crowd, and reached Josie's side. 

The women around her smiled warmly. 

""Mr. and Mrs. Andrews are so sweet, always together,"" one said. 

They hadn't seen the drama at the entrance. 

Josie recoiled from the jasmine perfume clinging to Laurence. 

As she stepped away, he anticipated her move, wrapping an arm around her waist. ""Stop being petty. You know I don't like it.""

Josie laughed coldly inside. He didn't dislike her attitude--he just didn't allow it. 

If Laurence had stayed with Rosalie all night, rumors of a split would've spread. 

By morning, his company's stock would've tanked billions. 

He was only here to fix his earlier mistake at the entrance. 

Josie didn't want to clash with him at this critical moment before her departure. 

She played the loving wife, mingling with the guests. 

Across the room, Rosalie watched Laurence gently fix Josie's hair, his expression soft. 

Her sweet face twisted with something darker. 

She slipped to a corner and made a call. ""Josie Watson's sick father--make sure he's taken care of.""

Chapter 6
Josie received a sudden call from the hospital, saying her father's condition had become unstable. 

She rushed to the hospital, only to find an intern doctor struggling to save him. 

He was sweating profusely. ""We need the chief surgeon now. His bl**d pressure's out of control.""

Josie grabbed a nurse. ""Where's my dad's primary doctor?""

The nurse replied, ""A VIP came for a full checkup today. All the doctors were called away.""

""How could this happen? Lives are at stake!"" Josie exclaimed. 

She knew the top floor had the best VIP wards. 

She bolted upstairs but found security guards blocking the hallway. 

""This floor's reserved today. You can't enter,"" one said. 

Josie dropped to her knees, begging. ""Please, let me find a deputy doctor. My dad needs surgery now!""

The four guards remained stone-faced. ""The dean gave strict orders. Letting you in costs us our jobs.""

""Miss, try transferring him. The checkup will take all day,"" another added. 

""Please, I'm begging you! His condition is really urgent!"" Josie cried, banging her head on the floor until bl**d appeared. 

Two guards, unable to watch, pulled her up. ""There's an ambulance downstairs. Hurry and transfer him. What a tragedy.""

This was Bayside's best private hospital, with guards paid better than most. 

Seeing their resolve, Josie ran back downstairs. 

As she ran, she called Laurence. 

The call connected, but Rosalie's voice came through. ""Laurence, I'm scared of needles. Come cover my eyes.""

""Okay,"" Laurence replied. ""Josie, I'm busy. I'll call you back,"" he said, hanging up before she could speak. 

Josie laughed bitterly, not bothering to call again, and focused on transferring her father. 

But as the ambulance pulled out, a truck slammed into it. 

The rear door was torn off. 

Luckily, the vehicle still ran. The injured driver pushed through, getting them to the nearest hospital. 

It took ten extra minutes. 

Josie's father reached the ER, but it was too late. 

The doctor, after hours of effort, delivered the grim news. ""If he'd arrived twenty minutes earlier, there might've been hope. I'm sorry.""

Josie collapsed to her knees, her mind blank. 

Her last family member was gone. 

Her phone buzzed. Laurence was calling back. 

Her trembling hand rejected the call. 

Laurence, hung up on, didn't try again, likely busy with his precious Rosalie. 

For the next four days, Josie handled her father's funeral like a ghost. 

Laurence, caught up bidding on a project with Rosalie, didn't notice her absence. 

He didn't even realize she hadn't shown up to work. 

After collecting her father's ashes, Josie chose not to buy a plot in Bayside. 

She decided to take the ashes with her. 

Before leaving, she visited the private hospital. 

Using her rapport with the nurses, she learned who the ""VIP"" was that day, demanding a full checkup. 

It was Rosalie. 

A healthy woman had pulled all the doctors for a pointless exam? 

Without Rosalie's prior provocations, Josie might've believed, like others, it was a coincidence. 

But Rosalie had done it on purpose. 

She'd deliberately ensured Laurence cut off her father's lifeline. 

Rosalie wanted Josie to carry the weight of this bl**d feud, ensuring no chance of reconciliation with Laurence. 

Laurence went all out for an outsider, while his wife's father died from delayed treatment. 

The next day, as Laurence left for work, Chris's car pulled up to the Andrews' doorstep. 

He looked at Josie, holding her father's ashes, his eyes full of regret and sympathy. ""Josie, I'm so sorry I came too late.""

Josie's face was stern. ""Chris, how much are you willing to do for me?""

Chris knelt on one knee, reverently ki**ing the back of her hand. ""The moment you pulled me from that cliff, I fell for your courage and strength. I'll give you everything. The entire Harris family is yours to command, my princess.""

Josie didn't fully trust Chris. 

But since Rosalie used Laurence to hurt her, she wouldn't hesitate to wield Chris as her weapon. 

They headed to the airport. 

After the plane took off, Josie sent a message to her lawyer. 

""Liquidate all the assets Laurence transferred to me in the divorce agreement. Do it fast, no matter the cost.""

Laurence. Rosalie. 

She'd make them taste her piercing pain.

I used to think people who took cold showers were either masochists or trying way too hard to be ""alpha."" Hot showers were my safe space sometimes I'd stay in there for 20 minutes just procrastinating on life.

But I kept hearing about the benefits, so I decided to torture myself for a month and see what happened.

Week 1: Pure agony. Not gonna lie, I screamed. Actual screaming. My body went into full panic mode every single time. I'd stand outside the shower for 5 minutes psyching myself up like I was about to jump out of a plane.

Week 2: Still terrible, but manageable. I stopped screaming but still did this weird breathing thing where I'd hyperventilate before getting in. Started with warm water, then gradually turned it cold. Baby steps.

Week 3: Something clicked. I started looking forward to the challenge. Weird, right? It became this daily test of ""can I do this hard thing?"" And every day I proved to myself that I could.

Week 4: Actually enjoying it. This sounds insane, but I started preferring cold showers. They felt... refreshing? Energizing? I felt like I could conquer anything afterward.

What changed beyond just shower temperature:

My confidence shot up. If I could handle 2 minutes of freezing water every morning, everything else felt easier. Difficult conversations, tough workouts, uncomfortable situations none of it seemed as scary.

My energy levels were insane. Cold water is like mainlining caffeine. I'd come out of the shower feeling more awake than after two cups of coffee.

I stopped avoiding hard things. The shower became practice for not backing down from discomfort. It spilled over into other areas I started having conversations I'd been avoiding, tackling projects I'd been putting off.

My mood improved. There's actually science behind this. Cold exposure releases endorphins and norepinephrine. Basically, natural antidepressants.

My biggest lesson was comfort is overrated. I'd been choosing the easy option in small ways all day hot showers, soft chairs, avoiding anything uncomfortable. Those tiny choices were making me soft everywhere else too.

If you want to try this start with 30 seconds at the end of your normal hot shower. Just turn it cold for the last bit. Build up gradually. Don't try to be a hero on day one.",1,1756818944.0,maxpower,0,1.0,False

1n6j3d0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeApplianceHelp/comments/1n6j3d0/should_the_best_electric_kettle_be_the_fellow/,Should the best electric kettle be the Fellow Stagg EKG Pro,"The Fellow 1171PRO-MB has been part of my daily routine for quite some time now, and I must say, it delivers a unique experience that stands out from other electric kettles. Sleek and functional, this kettle blends aesthetic appeal with exceptional usability. With a matte black finish and ergonomic design, it never fails to turn heads in the kitchen while proving to be highly efficient. Whether for morning coffee or evening tea, it has consistently raised the bar for what an electric kettle should offer.

**Upsides**

The merits of this product aren’t hard to spot, as they reveal themselves with every use. Here are a few noteworthy aspects:

- **Precise Temperature Control:** The high-resolution LCD screen and to-the-degree temperature adjustments make it a joy to use for all brewing needs. I’ve tailored my tea temperatures to perfection, which has elevated the taste experience significantly.
- **Intuitive User Interface:** The full-color display makes adjusting the clock, scheduling boils, or switching hold modes completely hassle-free. It feels like the product has been designed to integrate seamlessly into my routines.
- **Speed:** This kettle heats up impressively fast, whether it’s for a quick cup of green tea or preparing water for my French press. Every morning feels relaxed and efficient because of its quick heating element.
- **Customizable Profiles:** Scheduling features and the Guide Mode provide such personalized brewing options that even my friends have been impressed when they visit.
- **Durability:** Constructed from 304 18/8 stainless steel and designed with food-safe components, it shows no signs of wear even after daily use. It seems like an appliance built to last for years.

**Flaws**

However, no product is perfect, and this kettle isn’t without its drawbacks. Although the design is impressive, a couple of areas stood out as less favorable:

- **Price Sensitivity:** I found the cost slightly above average compared to standard electric kettles. While its features justify the investment, some budget-conscious buyers might hesitate.
- **Non-Dishwasher Safe:** Cleaning requires a bit of extra care, as regular mineral deposits need manual removal. This is not unique to this kettle but isn’t very convenient.
- **Handle Heat Build-Up:** Although not a dealbreaker, the handle can get slightly warm during extended use, especially if you’re brewing back-to-back. 

[Check Fellow 1171PRO-MB price on Amazon.](https://cyberlyber.com/p/b0bz59157h/)

**Ease of Use and Features**

The wide spout is perhaps one of the most useful additions for my tea routines. Pouring feels fluid and controlled, even with one hand, a feature my mom especially loves for her arthritis. Brew times are easy to track, thanks to the integrated stopwatch, ensuring precision with every cup. The WiFi-enabled firmware updates are a surprising bonus, creating an almost futuristic experience by keeping the device modern long after purchase.

While the kettle’s 0.9-liter capacity is ample for an individual, it does lag behind some larger alternatives if you’re catering to multiple people. Yet, what it lacks in size, it makes up for in efficiency and sheer usability.

**Product Alternatives**

In comparison with competing brands, the Fellow 1171PRO-MB finds its strongest rival in high-end models like the Breville Smart Kettle Luxe. While Breville wins on capacity and slightly more robust safety features, I found it lacks the level of artistic aesthetics and intuitive temperature precision that the Fellow provides. On the other hand, more budget-friendly competitors like the Hamilton Beach models offer standard features at a fraction of the price but fall short on build quality and style.

The design-forward nature of this electric kettle feels like a clear advantage over competitors while its intelligent features ensure it justifies its premium profile. However, I noticed models like Zwilling Enfinigy excel in exterior durability due to double-walled construction, though that doesn’t make up for the lack of customizable features.

**Value for Money**

For those willing to invest in a product that elevates daily habits, this kettle ticks all the right boxes. It doesn’t feel like just another appliance; it feels like a piece of well-crafted technology that’s meant to resonate with its user. While the steep cost may deter some, I see it as paying for precision and reliability—qualities that are worth every penny when you have a specific brewing preference.

Lately I’ve been carving out a tiny pocket of quiet each morning. Coffee still warm. Phone on do not disturb. A short reading of Scripture, a gentle reflection, a simple prayer. Those few minutes have steadied my heart, and I wondered if anyone else could use the same pause.

For two weeks I will send one short audio each morning, around three to five minutes. Free.

My hope is not to add more noise, but to help us look to Christ and draw nearer to God in the middle of ordinary life. A small daily pause. Nothing flashy.

If you listen, would you send a quick note back, maybe a 1 to 5 for sound quality, clarity, and how faithful to Scripture it felt, plus one thing to improve. Honest and simple.

To be open, these devotions are made with AI. The words are generated by AI and the voice is generated by AI as well. I read through each script, correct where needed, and keep Scripture at the center. This is a companion to your own Bible reading and church life, not a replacement.

If it proves genuinely helpful, I may keep going after the two weeks and shape this into something more steady.

I plan to share through a WhatsApp group. Your number will be visible to members. If that is a concern, tell me and I can send the audios privately.

If this resonates, send me a DM (or ask here and will contact you)  and I will share the invite.

* **Café solo** = tiny, strong espresso.

* **Café americano** = espresso diluted with hot water.
* **Café bombón** = espresso with condensed milk (sweet tooth alert!).

👉 The mistake tourists often make? Ordering a “latte” — baristas will look at you funny. In Spain, you say *café con leche*.

✨ Tip: if you want it in a **big cup** (like Starbucks size), ask for it *“en vaso grande”* or *“con leche en vaso.”* Otherwise, it comes small by default.

I thought I would never resort to this again. But what can I say, a girl's gotta do what she gotta do.

Highly independent. I work remotely and, over the past year and a half, I’ve been lucky enough to travel around nearby countries - mostly solo, but I wouldn’t mind sharing the journey with friends or ~someone.

Extroverted introvert. I love adventures: hiking mountains, sitting by the sea, exploring places that remind me how big the world is. But I also long for the everyday life, the boring stuff.

Anyways, I tested it out with Pugy/Pengu & Doodles to make some fan art/memes, and these are so cute! 

All I had to do was drop one reference image, say what I want, and that's it. Sometimes you do have to try a couple of times, though, until you have the desired results. But all of these were made on the first try!  And as some of you may know, Kontext allows you to remix 2 reference images. 

On Sogni AI apps, we've made it easy to use, so you can just drag and drop the two images. All you have to do next is tell the model what you want in plain English.

For one of my pictures below, I was surprised when it gave me another Polly. That's how context-aware it is!

Skylar
6th grade:
I’m walking into school behind my brother and Oliver, one of his best friends. They really don’t pay any
attention to me and only let me follow them to school because Mary makes them bring me. Mary is my
nanny, she has been with me as long as I can remember. My dad is the beta of the pack and really
busy, so Mary was brought on to teach me how to ‘behave like a lady,’ which basically means teach me
to be silent unless spoken to and out of the way of the men. She does nothing of the sort, but my dad
doesn’t know that, as long as I make a good show when he’s around.
My brother spends most of his time with the future Alphas, Cameron and Dakota, the future Delta, Sam
and the future Gamma Oliver. They travel in a group wherever they go, they are almost worse than
some of the girls here.
Mary told him to make sure I got to and from school safely after I came home last week with a bruise
under my eye and scrapes up my arm. I tried to tell her it was an accident and that I tripped, it was not
a big deal, but she didn’t believe me. She knows I have been having trouble with kids at the school. I
live in a werewolf pack that feeds on hierarchy and dominance, of course at some point we are all
going to start trying to showcase our dominance, we’re middle schoolers.
What I have seen though is it’s more the non-ranked kids who are trying to show off for the ranked kids.
They are trying to gain status by being noticed. It’s funny to think that some kids are popular, just for
the rank they were born into, not what they have actually done. Obviously, everybody wants to be the
Alpha’s kids friends. That’s the height of all popularity. My brother, Sam and Oliver aren’t far behind
being rank born. I, however, don’t matter, even though I am the Beta’s daughter and have Beta blood. I
am the reason that my mother is dead, and that is reason enough to shun me to lower than an Omega.
That is why Mary fears for me, she has seen how kids openly treat me and no adult does a thing to
stop it, not even my father.
“Move it fatty. You’re taking up the whole hallway and walking slower than a turtle. Are you sure you’re
a wolf?” Kaley sneers behind me. I just move to the side to try and get out of her way. She sticks her
foot between my legs and I trip sideways head first into a locker not being able to catch myself with my
armful of books.
The crash brings everyone to a halt. All eyes are on me, but the only ones I care about are my
brother’s. He turned to look at the sound and when I made eye contact he just shook his head, rolled
his eyes and turned to walk away, Oliver and Kaley following him. The rest of the kids in the hallway
disperse too, some laughing quietly, others not so quietly, but no one stops to help me up.
7th Grade:
“Don’t you ever question my authority in front of another student again!” Kaley shoulder checks me into
a door leading out to the courtyard in the middle of the school.
“I didn’t question your authority, I told you that you can’t hit kids just because they are in your way. If
you were late, that is not their fault.” I shouldn’t snap back at her, it only fuels her fire, but she’s starting
to get on my nerves. She was late because she skipped second period to go get coffee with her friends
and was late getting back to third period, who happens to be a teacher that will report her to her father.
Although nothing ever seems to happen when she is reported.
I right myself, set my focus down the hallway and move to walk away from the door that was holding
me up, but before I can get two steps, Marnie, one of Kaley’s little minions steps out to trip me, then
proceeds to dump her iced latte on my head. I hear cackles of laughter then others join in, meaning we
attracted a crowd.
I look up to see my brother and his friends joining in with the laughter. “Maybe if you trained a little
harder and lost some of that baby fat, you wouldn’t be so clumsy.” Kaley says not-so quietly to me then,

1n6ip9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/1n6ip9i/hospitality_supply_tips_how_the_right_products/,Hospitality Supply Tips: How the Right Products Can Boost Guest Satisfaction,"In the hospitality world, guest satisfaction isn’t just about location or price—it’s about the details. One area that often gets overlooked is **hospitality supply**. From the towels in the bathroom to the sheets on the bed, the products you choose play a huge role in shaping the overall experience.

Think about it: guests might forget the check-in process or the décor in the lobby, but they’ll always remember if their sheets felt crisp and clean or if the towels were scratchy. That’s why investing in the right supplies is more than just stocking a room—it’s about creating comfort that leaves a lasting impression.

Here are a few practical tips:

* **Start with the basics**: High-quality bed linens, pillows, and bath towels are non-negotiable. A comfortable night’s sleep and a refreshing shower can define a stay.
* **Don’t overlook small touches**: Guest room essentials like coffee, hangers, and well-placed lighting go a long way in making people feel at home.
* **Think durability**: Strong furniture, reliable hardware, and long-lasting amenities save money in the long run and reduce disruptions for guests.
* **Add a sustainable edge**: Eco-conscious travelers appreciate when hotels use biodegradable tableware, energy-efficient appliances, or green cleaning supplies. It’s both good for the planet and appealing to your guests.

Then get my morning coffee and slowly start reading work emails.

\- In the lunch brake I won't run into Google analytics to see how's my LP is converting. Instead, I'll take my wife out and have a lovely lunch break.

\- When work at my job is done at 5-6pm I won't open my personal laptop and run into coding marathon or marketing outreach. I'll just get back to my family. I'll take my son out to a skatepark where he rides scooter and I ride BMX. Yeah, I'm 36yo but I can jump on a trampoline :)

\- We'll be back at home by 8pm and will have amazing family dinner all together.

\- At 9pm I'll read my son a book unless he falls a sleep.

\- At 9:30 I'll grab my wife and we'll watch series on Netflix.

\- At 11pm I'll finally open my laptop... but I'll just spend 1-2 hours of playing video games or watching youtube.

\- On weekends I will sleep till 11am and spend rest of my day with family and friends. We have amazing forests and lakes 5mins out in the city outskirts.

You may say: ""Persistence is the key! ""At least we are trying"". ""Winner never quits"" - I don't give a damn any more. I've tasted both worlds: corporate and startup's founder. I choose 1st. You - please continue if you want. I'm too old for this sh\*t.

Maybe I'll join a startup one day, but definitely not as a co-founder. Founding engineer? - No problem.  

And you know what - I will regret not a minute. Because I'm so fed up with the startups. Never-ending ""grind-ship-grind-ship"" and ""1 man army"" culture. Prioritizing my ""super-duper"" B2B SaaS above life, above family, above myself. Screw it. We all gonna die in the end. Rich or poor - neither be me. I have good 9-5 that pays well. That's enough.

It was an interesting experience. I've been in it since 2020. I've met a lot of awesome ppl. I wrote more then 100k lines of code. I got some really nice insights and feedback. I learned a lot. I regret not. But I also don't like it anymore.

I'm out. Thanks.

  
But you - i'm sending my regards to your persistence and truly hope you will make it. Good luck.

1n6inqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1n6inqm/aitah_for_telling_my_sil_that_breastfeeding_is/,AITAH for telling my SIL that breastfeeding is not about her journey but about her starving baby?,"So I've published the first part of this story before on breastfeeding and mommit subreddits and I've been made feel like a monster because ""mother knows best"". For the record, we are in Europe. I'm sorry for my English, and also I'm extremely emotional. 

My SIL Julia gave birth to a little Amanda 11 weeks ago. From the beginning, Amanda was barely growing, mostly losing weight instead of gaining. My country is heavily pro breastfeeding and Julia decided that she wanted to breastfeed. However, Amanda wasn't gaining weight properly and landed in 0.1 percentile for weight.

Julia forbade me and my mum from coming to visit them. She said we will poison her if we bring her food. It was surprising especially that before she gave birth, we were good friends. So we only saw little Amanda on pictures and videos my brother has been sending to us. And only once, my mum said she's worried because Amanda looked like she's hungry (she was crying and writhing, pushing her fists into her mouth) while Julia narrated on the video that this is how a happy baby looks like with a full belly. So my mum asked if Julia cannot give her a bottle because Amanda still seems hungry.

Julia went berserk and cut us off completely. She was pumping but her supply didn't go up at all. Amanda had a tongue tie resolved but it didn't help much. Julia was using donor's milk to top up Amanda's feeds through a sonde (I don't know what this thing is called). 

Now, every week they're visiting a doctor's office for a control checkup of the weight. This is where it gets really messy. They were there yesterday. And yesterday, my brother called us crying that Amanda is in the hospital.

The story went like this: As always, Julia asked my brother to bring her coffee before the weighing appointment while she's using the nursing room to change Amanda's nappy. As always, he did. Except this time, a nurse went in in the middle of it to ask Julia about some paperwork. And the nurse saw that Julia was feeding Amanda from a bottle right before the check up... the bottle was 150cc of milk and it was already half down. The nurse said that Julia was supposed to wait with feeding until after the checkup, and then my brother came in.

He got very mad. He said that Julia refused giving Amanda the bottles so wtf was going on. Then he took the bottle, and at the same time Amanda vomited with a very, very thick milk. Nurse went crazy and checked the bottle and it was filled with milk mixed with rice cereal.

The doctor who's been called to see it immediately ordered moving Amanda to the hospital for an emergency check up especially after seeing Julia who went berserk and started throwing stuff around and yelling at everyone that she will be feeding her baby however and whenever she wants.

We went to the hospital to see my brother. Amanda already had her blood tests done and they showed some problems with kidneys, liver and vitamins level and iron. The doctors said she has been starving for a long time and why nobody from our family reacted. We told them the story about Julia claiming that we will poison her.

So the doctors immediately took Julia for a psych evaluation for PPD, but... turns out she was faking it. She admitted to the doctor (she was super scared that somebody might take the baby from her) that her friend told her that if she fakes PPD, we will leave her alone and she will have peace of mind during her breastfeeding. 

The doctors then told her that what she did was not okay and that she was regularly stuffing the baby with milk and cereal before the weight checkup so as to pretend that Amanda grew. And that she should just give Amanda bottles with formula because this is about the little girl's life and survival as she's now failure to thrive and her life and health are in danger.

Julia got very mad. She yelled that she will either breastfeed Amanda or she won't feed her at all and that the choice is only hers because this is her baby and nobody else's.

Now this is when the doctors told Julia that either she will go for another psych evaluation or they call the police. Julia agreed for the evaluation and they locked her for a week.

My brother is working 14 hours per day because they are poor and after their wedding Julia decided she wants to be a traditional wife and he has to earn their living. So my brother said that whatever Julia is doing, it must be right. But after seeing what was happening, he got super mad. He said that she starved Amanda on purpose for her own sick satisfaction even though he was working hard on providing money so they would be able to buy formula if needed. He said he wanted divorce and full custody over Amanda. We don't k ow if he will get it because it's rare for dad to take care of their daughters. Also the doctors are mad at him that he didn't notice what Julia was doing.

Before Julia went to the ward, I got angry and told her that she made monsters out of us and that we were just worried about her and Amanda. And that thos whole situation was always only about Julia and her ""breastfeeding journey"" and not about Amanda's life. She called me a b*tch and said I should’ve died in childhood because nobody can love an autistic person like me.

1n6ijjf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n6ijjf,How I went to $200 per hour from $6/h on Upwork | Have any questions?,"How I started freelancing. I started a website with funny content for about 2-3 years prior to starting freelance. It started have good traffic and I wanted to add cool features so I started progressively to learn how to code for free on codecademy(not paid by them to mention them). I was getting money from Google Ads but at that time money from this advertising was paid very little in my country. I was getting good at coding and wanted to earn more so I found out about Elance which now is Upwork

Here are the most important lessons I learned along the way:

1. Provide excellent and above services! If you don't at the moment, put time and effort into training! The results should be high quality and the communication excellent. I had a 2-year period where I studied at least 1 hour per day because things in Web Development move fast and you need to know the best ways of doing things. In the beginning, I even had periods where I just worked, studied, slept, and repeated. In terms of communication, I reply as fast as I can to messages where I'm on mobile at a coffee. I am available 7/7 days per week and work mainly in US hours because those are my main clients and I like working more at night. I WENT ALL IN. My main priority besides health and family is my job. I wanted to be 10x better than the best Google developers
2. Choose your clients wisely! I really mean it. I had times when I rushed and chose clients without defining the terms clearly and it ended up in lowering my JSS and losing my Top Rated status for a few good months. It was not a fun period because I didn't get as many jobs as before. So the client that you choose now will likely affect your next jobs because they can leave you reviews and affect your JSS. Also, make sure that you are +80% sure that you can do a great job on this contract. If you end up taking the contract and don't manage to do the work successfully try explaining to the client, refund what you can, and find a friendly agreement with the client.
3. Save money from contracts and always have some funds available because your jobs might not be regular all the time. And this will probably be the case especially when you start. I took contracts that I shouldn't have mainly because of lack of funds.
4. Know your prices. Don't be afraid to try higher prices as long as you deliver excellent and above services. In the beginning, I used to get jobs with their default fixed price(low) and lower hourly price. I learned that clients don't usually know that things take more time and effort than they expect. Also, if you see other freelancers who work for lower budgets that doesn't mean that you can't go higher than them. I had a client who posted a fixed-price job for $200 and I closed with him that project for 10k( paid $200 per hour). You can also go higher than an employee in your field because you provide higher-quality services, work like an entire business, and take care of: planning, managing, offering support, consulting, and communicating throughout the entire project. I work at the moment per hour and provide a range of estimated hours for a particular thing. I had cases where I needed additional hours and I explained why and clients approved it. With time you will know better how much certain things take and offer estimates for longer projects. Some experienced freelancers also offer fixed-price services because they already know overall how much time a certain project will cost after they discuss it with the potential client. Hourly or fixed, whatever works best for you.

I had 3 stages of exponential growth or abZ moments. ↓

Stage 1. I started to place about 90% of my proposals on hourly jobs at around $30 per hour. I ended up doing this because I was reviewing my previous contracts and I noticed that I earned the most on hourly contracts. At that stage, I was earning pocket money. I did some calculations of the amount of hours that I can work per week times my price and the results were ideal for that stage of my life in my geographical area. I managed to get a few good hourly contracts for good periods of time. After about 1-2 years, I had a comfortable life. It was “hard” to believe that I finally was able to do that and that my basic decision based on a simple calculation paid off and became a reality. A mental barrier of mine was that it was very hard to be hired for weekly work because I had worked on small projects before. Being paid hourly meant that I was getting money every week and that was a game changer.

Stage 2. I discovered Sam Ovens's YouTube videos. I doubled my hourly rate to $70-75. He reminded me of the good things that I did and which I need to prioritize, like: continuous high-quality focus without being disturbed, putting all my valuable time into my work and excluding tasks that don't matter, studying successful people, and applying what they're doing and works for you, optimal defaults, periodically review what you're doing and take some breaks. I watched 10's of hours of his videos. He previously had interviews with Consulting students and recordings from weekly calls. l am forever grateful to this man! He has incredible experience in optimizing an online service business started by one person. I learned a lot of practical things that applied to my case.

Stage 3. I discovered Freelance MVP(Evan)'s YouTube videos. I doubled my rate to $150 and then raised it again to $200. Prior to this I was in a tough period with almost no ongoing contracts. My JSS was about 70. I recovered to Top Rated and Top Rated Plus in about 2-3 months of listening to him. From his public videos, he reminded me of the importance of choosing clients wisely and taught me how to improve my profile and my proposal. After he opened his academy I immediately applied to join his Pro Group and I learned even more: how to end a contract, how to optimize my video call setup, that there are high-paying clients, and many more things. Besides the Pro Group, he has a more beginner-friendly community called The Academy and you will find the link on the About page of his YouTube channel .For years I was looking for Upwork experts on YouTube and didn't find anything of this level.

1n6ihun,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheTicker/comments/1n6ihun/kraft_heinz_to_separate_into_two_publicly_traded/,Kraft Heinz to Separate Into Two Publicly Traded Companies,"Bloomberg) -- Kraft Heinz Co. said Tuesday it plans to split into two separate companies, undoing a mega-deal ushered in a decade ago that turned the maker of Kraft Mac & Cheese into one of the largest packaged food sellers in the world.

Following the breakup, one company will be made up of its Heinz Ketchup and other iconic condiments and boxed meals — a unit that currently generates $15.4 billion in sales. The second firm will include the slower-growing grocery products such as Oscar Mayer hot dogs and Lunchables, which currently generate revenue of $10.4 billion.

The company had foreshadowed this move, and its shares were little changed in premarket trading. The stock is down about 21% in the 12 months through Friday’s close.

The aim is to siphon off lagging grocery staples into a new entity, allowing its faster-moving products more room to run and management to better focus on growing each side of the business. The company said the split will occur through a tax-free spinoff, and the companies’ names will be determined later.

“The complexity of our current structure makes it challenging to allocate capital effectively, prioritize initiatives and drive scale in our most promising areas,” said Miguel Patricio, Kraft’s current chairman. “By separating into two companies, we can allocate the right level of attention and resources to unlock the potential of each brand.”

Food Deals

The Kraft Heinz split follows similar breakups by other food and drink companies, including Kellogg, which broke into two firms in 2023, and Keurig Dr Pepper, which recently said it would undo a 2018 deal that brought together its coffee and beverage businesses.

The announcement unwinds a $46 billion merger a decade ago that united two iconic brands. That deal, orchestrated by 3G Capital and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., forged an industry behemoth shortly before new forces began to reshape Americans’ shopping, including greater demand for healthier, less-processed foods, new weight-loss drugs and rising inflation that’s caused consumers to cut back. 

Splitting the companies companies will “unleash the power of our brands and unlock the potential of our business,” said Chief Executive Officer Carlos Abrams-Rivera, who will become the CEO of the grocery company following the spinoff. 

That entity will also house Kraft Singles cheese, while the condiments powerhouse will include Philadelphia cream cheese. Kraft Heinz said the full divvying up of its brands would be announced later.

Headquarters Remain 

Kraft Heinz said it didn’t plan to change the location of its headquarters in Pittsburgh and Chicago.

In May, Abrams-Rivera said Kraft Heinz was considering “potential strategic transactions,” without providing further details. He did make clear the company was prioritizing its best-performing brands, including Heinz Ketchup and Kraft Mac & Cheese, with aims of becoming a “sauces and meals powerhouse.”

Kraft Heinz is working with a recruiting firm to find a CEO for the second company, currently dubbed the “global taste elevation company.” 

The company said it expects the transaction to close by the second half of 2026, with the separation overseen by John Cahill, the board’s vice chair and previous chief executive of Kraft Foods Group, Inc. 

Industry Changes

Kraft’s move extends the refashioning of the US food industry at a time it’s under scrutiny from consumers and government regulators. 

In 2023, the Kellogg Company spun off its cereal business as WK Kellogg Co. and its snacking brands, including Pringles and Cheez-It, into Kellanova. Both are now on track to be acquired by closely held companies, leading analysts to predict a similar fate for Kraft Heinz’s new units.

Mars Inc. announced it would buy Kellanova for nearly $36 billion in August 2024, and in July Italian candymaker Ferrero International SA agreed to purchase WK Kellogg for an enterprise value of $3.1 billion.

When the Drexi unveiled their revolutionary quantum brain cybernetics and announced to the universe that they had conquered death, a human diplomat was heard muttering to a Draghosi colleague “Cute, we tried that in the carboniferous, its still pending peer review, but we got a really good meme about it, I’ll forward it you later”.

It wasn’t malice, Humanity was just old, ancient would be more appropriate in a way that they had circled back to profoundly bored, to the Humans the Universe was a well thumbed box set that they had already binge watched twice, knew all the plots by heart, all the twists and spoilers with a dull sense of predictability and all the episodes were stained with coffee and regret.

But Humanity had a purpose, they treated the younger species as their children, because compared to Humanity that is exactly what they were, they were eager, loud and emotionally volatile toddlers in a universe with untold dangers and perils, where they were convinced that their problems were unique, their wars epic and their tentacle fashion revolutionary.

And so, when the quarrels broke out as they always do, Humanity would intervene with the weary sigh of a parent that had just sat down after a long day. A simple hand on a shoulder here, a gentle “don’t put that in your mouth, you don’t know where’s it’s been” there.

Sometimes they would swap a war-torn planet for a completely unusable one just to confuse everyone and make them stop fighting, sometimes Humanity would slip a few million tons of grain into a miracle harvest leaving behind a note signed the League of Extremely Giving Snack Dads.

Humanity never asked for thanks, but boy, did the younger races resent Humanity for it.

The complaints in the Grand Galactic Council Chamber would stretch on for hours

“Humanity, stop treating us like toddlers”

“Humanity, stop moving our sacred war moons”

“Humanity, you’re so, so lazy, you just drink, sing and dance to terrible songs like the macarena and nap whilst we build empires”.

The council chamber rang with accusations, Humanity with its infinite patience seemed content to sit back and carry on with their crossword puzzle, then the Drexi ambassador pointed a finger at the Human ambassador and screamed “We would be better off if you left us alone”  .

With that the Human ambassador put down his crossword and said the most terrifying words in any parent’s arsenal “Alright, have it your way”

And in the blink of an eye, humanity was gone.

All that remained in the Human ambassador’s seat was a half-finished crossword puzzle, a cup of tea and a packet of chocolate chip cookies.

At first the galaxy rejoiced.

“No more meddling primates” cried the Vra’kol who immediately declared war on a neutral party for the crime of looking at them with intent.

“At last, we control our destiny” shouted the Drexi who implemented their brand-new flawless logistics AI, which rerouted 98% of the galactic food to a deserted asteroid labelled storage unit A-113 because it had optimal parking.

“Now we will prove our superiority” boomed the Yavrix who promptly lost their homeworld in a trade dispute over decorative space pebble tariffs.

For a month it was glorious everyone did as they pleased but by the end of the first year it had become a glorious disaster, wars raged, famine reared its ugly head and societies began to collapse. By the end of the of the first decade the galaxy was one complete dumpster fire that had been hit by a train then flung into a fireworks factory.

The Drexi AI starved the Vra’kol who had mistakenly bombed storage unit A-113 with rotten fruit out of spite, the Yavrix guided by their new honour code, which was coincidentally written by a very inebriated poet declared war on a nebula and lost, the Ziv’la terrified of current galactic developments pre-emptively nuked their own gift shops just in case.

Within 50 years, trillions were dead, famine, plague and endless wars shattered alliances and brought the galaxy to the brink, Refugees wandered the stars and across countless burning worlds to find safety while governments issued unhelpful flyers about home over association rules.

The galaxy had demanded independence, and it had gotten it, and as a result had set its own trousers on fire.

By year one hundred the survivors were barely hanging on, they barely remembered Humanity as they cursed the stars, cursed each other and cursed the Drexi’s customer service line for the Logi-Tron 5000 which was redirecting every support call to storage unit A-113.

And then, suddenly it stopped.

On a thousand battlefields guns sputtered and extruded perfectly grilled cheese toasties, tactical screens blinked in Comic Sans “Time out is over, play nice, also, somebody clean this up, you know who you are”.

Refugees blinked to find themselves back at home with long lost family and friends, worlds destroyed by war were instantly reverted back to the state they had been in 100 years ago. Wounded awoke to find themselves healed, limbs no longer missing and a faint aftertaste of chicken coup laced with a suspiciously large amount of whiskey, entire ecosystems were restored with lawns freshly mowed.

Terrified and confused the younger races staggered back into the council chamber, ragged and smelling faintly of baked goods.

And there they were, Humanity.

Lounging in chairs, drinking what looked like coffee but smelt strongly of rum, playing an incomprehensible card game involving quantum trump suits whilst having a loud argument about whether Jerry was cheating, they were carrying on as if nothing had happened.

“You’re alive” gasped the Vra’kol warlord as he cradled a toastie

“Where were you” demanded the Drexi, desperately trying to get the Logi-Tron 5000 to stop serving recipes

“We, we have suffered” cried the Yavrix clutching a cookie and fighting back tears “You abandoned us”

The representatives of Humanity all smiled, not cruelly, not mockingly but with the exhausted patience which can come from being the universe’s only babysitter.

“No” said one of the Humans with a magnificent beard, wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with Beard meats food “we didn’t abandon you, we gave you a reality time out, we built you a nice little pocket dimension with no sharp edges and no real furniture so you couldn’t hurt yourselves and we let you work it out for yourselves, and what did you do, you wrecked the place”

The chamber fell silent.

Then a Human in a sweater rose carrying a mug which read #1 Galactic Progenitor, she sipped from her mug, adjusted her spectacles and let out a peppermint scented sigh of disappointment.

“You told us to stop interfering” she began “so we did, for a hundred years you had the entire universe without us, and what happened”

No one spoke.

“You fought each other, you starved each other, and you made truly awful life choices, that was the future you wanted, freedom from us irritating elders” she stated “You had your independence, and what did you do with it, you burned down the kitchen with your own hair”

Behind her a human slammed down a card “Reverse temporal polarity on the ace of space, read the rules JERRY!!”

The grandmother smiled warmly “Children” she said, putting down her mug “Independence is not about being free of guidance, it is about learning why guidance matters and no Drexi you can’t spreadsheet your way out of a spaghetti fight”

And from that moment on, no one called Humanity lazy.

Annoying, most definitely, prone to carrying colourful, humorous mugs and humming terrible songs about barbies, absolutely.

But not lazy.

They were the parents, the oldest, most patient and most utterly insane parents in the universe, who would sip coffee while the galaxy screamed at them, because they already had the remote control and weren’t afraid to press the off button.

And the younger races, chastened, wiser and somehow a little better for the experience never again demanded Humanity “leave them alone”

For they had learned the truth in the century of silence.

Humanity wasn’t the parents the universe they wanted, Humanity was the parent the universe needed.",30,1756817119.0,HFY,3,0.98,False

Resolvi iniciar no hobby com um baixo orçamento para começar a experimentar cafés diferentes e, como queria sentir um pouco do prazer de moer meu café na hora e ter algo mais fresco, iniciei com um moedor manual iCoffee M3 Pro.

Estou aos poucos tentando ajustar e entender a regulagem dos cliques dele mas não estou conseguindo me livrar dessas partículas finissimas que entopem meu melittão. Será que é algo que eu estou fazendo de errado ou dei o azar de pegar um moedor (que pelo que li depois de ter comprado, já não é consistente) ruim?

Eu zerei os cliques no sentido horário até travar, depois fui contando no sentido anti-horário 20 cliques, que foi onde comecei. Com 20, muito ácido, mas ainda com fines o suficiente pra não ter uma passagem rápida no Melitta. Baixei pra 18, depois 16 e enfim 14. Com 14 consegui uma extração mais equilibrada, porém gerou tantas partículas finas que a extração ficou muito demorada e empoçou no coador, acabei tendo que cortar metade da água que era pra passar pra não ficar amargo.

Tirei duas fotos, a que dá pra ver visivelmente uma lama é o café moído no clique 14, a parte mais grossa do café ficou pra baixo da cama e não dá pra ver. A segunda foto com grãos mais uniformes é o café torrado e moído Três Corações Sul de Minas Gourmet. A minha moagem ficou levemente mais grossa do que o Três Corações, mas com muito mais partículas finas e irregular.

O café que estou usando é o Sirkel - O Flautista, que comprei na amazon e veio com uma torra de mais ou menos 1 mês.

A proporção que estou usando é em média 1:15.

Lighting: Started with budget-friendly smart bulbs from Wyze Bulb Color. They're okay, but the color accuracy isn't great, and they sometimes disconnect.

Lesson learned: Don't skimp too much on lighting.
Voice Control: Used a Google Home Nest Mini as the central hub. Works well for basic commands, but struggles with more complex routines.

Security: A cheap Kwikset Convert Smart Lock. It gets the job done, but the app is clunky and the battery life is questionable. I probably should have splurged for something more reliable.

Smart Plugs: These were a game changer! I automated everything from lamps to coffee makers with cheap smart plugs. Best value for money, hands down. I use TP-Link Kasa Smart Plugs.

Energy Monitoring: Tried a DIY energy monitoring system using a Raspberry Pi. It was fun to set up, but ultimately too much hassle to maintain.

Robot Vacuum: I picked up a Eufy E25 robot vacuum. It wasn't top-of-the-line, but it was on sale and had decent reviews. Honestly, it's been great for keeping the floors generally clean. I schedule it to run every day, and it definitely reduces the amount of manual vacuuming I have to do. I was skeptical at first, but I'm now a convert.

Overall, I'd say the project was a partial success. I definitely achieved a more """"smart"""" home, but I also learned that you get what you pay for. Certain areas are worth investing in, while others can be tackled with budget-friendly options.

1n6ig0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1n6ig0q/i_dropped_out_of_college_to_work_at_an_oldfolks/,"I dropped out of college to work at an Old-Folks Home, and now I can't sleep at night","This is a confession. And a warning.

I wish I could say nothing, but I know I wouldn’t be able to live with myself. This is the least I can do, posting this.

I can only hope it will be enough.

About a year ago, I was in a rough patch. I was in college and my grades were plunging straight into the ground. I had stopped caring about school when my only friend had been killed in a car accident at the beginning of the year. All of the grief was making me reconsider my values and life ambitions. Ultimately, I came to the decision that life was too short to do things I hated.

So, instead of trying to salvage my education, I decided to drop out and look for a job. The money I had saved up for tuition became my personal savings. Instead of going to class, I worked on my resume and applied to jobs. At the time, all I knew was I needed to get out of the town where I was living, and put my failed schooling behind me.

I had recently finished CNA training in a misguided attempt to find jobs within my major (Nursing). Taking the course had burned me out in some ways, but I was grateful to have something concrete for my resume. I applied to hospitals, private practices, even prisons. Honestly, I was just looking for anywhere that was hiring.

After three months of no luck, I was at the end of my rope.

Then one day I found a listing on Indeed for an opening at a Nursing Home that looked promising. The pay was good, and they were also out of state. That last bit sounds like a hassle, but it was a bonus for me.  Getting the job would mean moving away, which is something I really wanted to do. Anything to get away from the memory of my friend.

I put in an application, not really expecting anything. A week later, I received an email. It told me I had gotten an interview for a CNA position.

The Nursing Home was a few states away, but I didn’t want to spend a lot of money on plane tickets. I decided to take a risk and drive down with all my stuff. I didn’t own a lot, and anyway, I wasn’t coming back. This interview was the excuse I needed to get away.

I filled two suitcases with whatever I could, gave the rest to my roommates, canceled my lease and turned in my key. Homeless and jobless, I drove away, never looking back.

After two days of driving, I arrived at my destination: the Home. It was impressive. Just by looking at the outside you could tell it was one of those fancy retirement homes only the uber rich could afford. Sweeping lawns, pillared terraces, that kind of shit. It looked like something out of *Downton Abbey*. It must have housed over a hundred residents, and even though I had been to almost a dozen different facilities, I had never seen anything that compared to this.

I remember being in awe, both by its size and its beauty. Even now, it weirds me out at how calm I felt, like this was the place I was meant to be.

The woman who interviewed me was also strange. I had worked for a few other assisted living facilities at that point, and to put it politely, the people that ran them looked only a few years away from staying there themselves. My would-be boss wasn’t like that. She was young, tall, thin, and looked like she should be in LA starring in the next big movie or television show. That, or maybe CEO of the next Multi-level Marketing Company.

She was also exceptionally kind. Most people never went out of their way to treat me with anything more than base politeness. She seemed to actually care about me, which made me put my guard down. We chatted for the first twenty minutes of the interview about my personal interests, what I thought of the facility, and some tv shows both of us had seen. After confirming my skill set, she offered me the job on the spot.

I accepted. I wonder where I would be now if I hadn’t. Maybe I would still be able to sleep at night.

At the time, I was relieved. My risk had paid off. Besides, I had already spent a large chunk of savings on this trip, and I needed the cash. I signed some paperwork, gave some personal info, thanked her, then went to find an apartment.

The city was a twenty minute drive away from the Home. It wasn’t bad, as cities go. Sure, it was grungy and a bit run down, but that was my style. I felt like I fit right in. I found an apartment on the bad side of town that fit my price range: dirt cheap. The interior was old, with decor that hadn’t been updated since the 80’s, but there was wifi and the carpet wasn’t too dirty. It was also close to some good restaurants (hole in the wall places, but absolutely delicious food) and the laundromat was built into the complex as well.

In a word, it was convenient. Very convenient.

I unpacked, and started my new life.

Work was rigorous. My boss warned me about that in the interview. The Home was run strictly and efficiently, and it was proud of their system. Like most everything about it, their ideas of how a nursing home should be handled was different from most other assisted living facilities. First off, employees were assigned to singular residents, like personal servants. My boss had explained it was to provide a higher standard of care, as most of the paying customers were shelling out fortunes to stay there.

For the CNA’s, shifts were divided into a morning and evening cycle, a different CNA being selected for both. They were expected to be at their resident’s beck and call for the entirety of their shift. Duties included helping residents with the bathroom, administering medication, fetching items, and doing whatever the resident either needed or wanted. If they said jump, we leaped, no questions asked. It sounds miserable, but honestly, it wasn’t nearly as bad as I thought it would be.

I was assigned to Mrs. Beverly. 

I mentioned earlier that I was no stranger to working in Assisted Living Facilities. However, I there is a secret I’ve never told anyone:

I’m terrified of old people.

I don’t know if it comes from my grandparents raising me, or if it’s just some sort of genetic trait that never worked its way out of my DNA, but I am not comfortable around anyone over the age of sixty.

But for some reason, Mrs. Beverly didn’t bother me. She was old, yes. Very old. But on my first day, I walked in and saw her reading *Salem’s Lot* by Stephen King, one of my favorite all-time books. Needless to say, we hit it off right away.

Mrs. Beverly was from Germany, and had been there when the Berlin wall both rose and fell. She had the most endearing German accent, which sounds strange, but trust me, for lack of a better term, it was cute. She was also one of the kindest people I had ever met.

Mrs. Beverly assured me from day one that she thought the long hours I worked were absurd, and that she wouldn’t need all that much help-wise. This was a relief. When I overheard some of the other residents talking to their CNA’s, I could tell most were not like Mrs. Beverly.

She also told me she didn’t want me to lose hours on her account, so she told me to stay and do whatever I wanted until my shift was over.

We quickly fell into a routine that benefited me immensely. Most of the day was spent talking with Mrs. Beverly or playing my switch while Mrs. Beverly slept. When she was awake, we would swap horror book recommendations, and watch *Supernatural.* Sometimes we’d shake it up with an old black-and white horror movie. We watched *Nosferatu* at least once a week.

Sometimes Mrs. Beverly would need actual help, like going to the bathroom or getting medication, but she was pretty self-sufficient. Apart from being wheelchair bound, she was exceptionally independent for a geriatric living in a care facility.

There were also other perks. The Home had the most delicious cafeteria. Most Assisted-Living Cafeteria’s are garbage, but the Home’s food still makes my mouth water thinking about it. CNA’s and other workers could pay to eat there, but the prices were ridiculously high (the food was worth it though). I had no self-control when it came to eating there. I think I gained fifteen pounds in the first few months. It might have started eating into my savings if it wasn’t for Mrs. Beverly.

Once she learned I loved to eat there, Mrs. Beverly would order an absolute shitload of food, then slide most of it over to me when it was brought to her. I would try to refuse, or pay her at least, but she would just wink and tell me to eat. She said it did her good to see someone as skinny as I was putting meat on my bones.

That saved me a ton of money on food, and the pay was so good I was getting back what I had lost by moving way faster than anticipated. I don’t exaggerate when I say it was the best job I ever had.

While Mrs. Beverly was cool, the Home was still strange to me. There was not a lot of interaction among coworkers, since there was only one worker per resident. I spent so much time with Mrs. Beverly, I only ever saw my coworkers in passing. For those I did have surface-level interactions with, I got to know a few of their faces, but every time I was starting to get familiar with someone, they’d quit and a new worker would take their place. The Home had a high turnover rate, but they never seemed to be hurting for workers. New faces would replace old ones almost immediately.

Life became routine, and before I knew it, four months had passed. Even with my unexpected connection with Mrs. Beverly, life was kind of lonely. But I wasn’t complaining. Sure, I spent most evenings playing *Elden Ring* and drinking beer all by myself, but I was making a lot of money and didn’t have to worry about finances anymore. I had a roof over my head, food in the fridge, and no homework or other school nonsense to worry about.

Life was good.

However, one day, I was a bit later clocking out than usual. The Home still used punch cards, along with some other outdated equipment, even though the medical stuff was top notch. I didn’t mind. It was cool to walk around the manor, and the old tech made it feel like you were stepping back in time.

But this day, I was in a hurry. I had accidentally overstayed talking with Mrs. Beverly, and didn’t want to get written up for taking unauthorized overtime.

When I got to the clock-in station, the room was empty. Normally there would be one or two people clocking out, as well as cafeteria and laundry staff taking a dinner break. It was just another reminder for how late I was. I punched out, and turned to go out the door. I wasn’t looking where I was going, and I ran headlong into someone entering the room.

It was a short, college-aged girl with long blonde hair and the thick kind of glasses that people wear in ads but no one really wears in real life. She was cute, and I definitely stared way too long at her. I was still a bit dazed. Once I stopped acting like a neanderthal, I apologized awkwardly, and she told me it was fine and not to worry about it. While she punched in, I ducked out and went home, kicking myself for being so awkward.

That Sunday (the only day I had off during the week) I was at a coffee shop when I saw her again. At first I tried to stay out of sight, embarrassed, but she saw me before I could get away. She came over and started chatting with me.

Her name was Lena. She had seen my *Beserk* brand of sacrifice tattoo on my wrist, which I had gotten when I was sixteen and didn’t know any better. She had wanted to compliment me on it on the day I had literally bumped into her, but I had left before she could say anything.

We got our coffees and kept talking for most of the morning.

She was into *Beserk* too, and she had been working at the Home for three months longer than me. She also worked for Mrs. Beverly, and we both agreed that she was the absolute coolest. We were into the same video games (*Hollow Knight, Dark Souls, Zelda*) and had a lot of other stuff in common. She had dropped out of college three months before I did, and had an awkward relationship with her parents as well.

She had somewhere she needed to be later that day so we said goodbye and parted ways, but before I could leave she grabbed my phone and punched in her number. “For shift exchanges,” she said. She sent herself a text so she would have my number, then left the coffee shop. I had major butterflies in my stomach watching her go.

The next Sunday, she texted to hang out, and I played it cool by replying “sure.” I then spent way too much time trying to pick out my outfit. We went to a local arcade, spending over fifty bucks in quarters. She told me she had wanted to go for ages but didn’t have anyone to go with who would appreciate it.

We learned we lived in the same apartment complex. I was worried that might be creepy, but Lena started showing up in the evenings with a six pack and an extra controller. There were a few hours between my shift and hers (Mrs. Beverly was cool with her showing up late) so we’d play games and drink a little before Lena would leave to catch the chartered bus to the Home as she didn’t have a car.

That went on for two months. We would hang out evenings, and then spend most of Sunday together doing something or other that caught our interest. Sometimes she would stay so late, she would crash on my couch, and leave the next morning. After two weeks, I started giving Lena a ride to the Home so we could spend a bit more time together in the evenings. She accepted. Those hours in the car were special. We would talk about everything and anything. Even though it was eating into my savings and my old car was needing repairs from the extra mileage, it was worth it.

I was happier than I’d ever been.

Mrs. Beverly noticed my new cheerful attitude, and asked me why I was so happy. I didn’t really tell her why. The Home had a pretty strict anti-romantic-relationship policy when it came to coworkers. It could be grounds to be fired. At the time, I guessed they were tired of CNA’s hooking up in the linen closets on shift, and that was how they put a stop to it.

So I didn’t talk about Lena. I gave some other excuse about why I was smiling more, and Mrs. Beverly left it at that. But I always suspected she knew what was really going on.

One night, Lena and I were at my apartment messing around. We had gotten a pizza, and drank a little too much. We were arguing about some small chemistry principle both of us didn’t really remember from our college days. It was a playful argument, nothing serious. We looked up the factoid, and it turned out I was right. Lena shoved me, and we started play-fighting, and the next thing I knew our faces were inches from each other.

I leaned in and kissed Lena for the first time.

I pulled away and we stared at each other in shock. I had always played it really safe with Lena. She was my only friend there. I didn’t want to ruin that. It was nice to have someone to talk to and spend time with, someone my age and who really understood me. Although I wouldn’t have minded if things had gone to more physical places, I was afraid that I would lose all the good things that had been there if I tried to force it.

I was already beating myself up in my head for being so stupid and impulsive.

I started to apologize.

That’s when Lena came up and kissed me back.

I won’t go into details of what happened after, but it was very clear both of us had been waiting for someone to make a move. How long we had both been waiting, I don’t know, but all of the feelings I had tried to keep buried came to the surface and I just gave into them.

But before we could do anything substantial, Lena’s phone alarm went off for her shift at the Home.

I was too drunk to drive, and she was about to miss her bus, so she got her clothes on, and told me that she would be back tomorrow night. We had one last kiss, and she ran out the door. I laid back on my bed with the greatest feeling. I could hardly wait for the next time we would see each other.

The next morning, I went on shift. Mrs. Beverly, and I were both in exceptionally good moods. She asked again why I was so happy, and I let it slip that I had met someone. We gossiped about my mystery girl, and the romance of her past. Even though I kept Lena’s name out of it, it felt so good to finally tell someone.

My shift passed by in a blur, and I got to my apartment. I went a little crazy. I cleaned everything, bought flowers, and even went to our favorite Thai place to get takeout.

Everything was prepared, and I waited.

Lena never showed up.

The next two weeks were a haze. I tried texting, but she didn’t respond. I called and it went to voicemail. At first, I believed that she’d ghosted me. I let myself have it. I screamed at myself in the mirror about how huge of an idiot I was and even broke my TV when I punched it in a drunk rage one night.

I was alone again, and it was worse than before. This time, I knew what I was missing.

I drowned myself in booze and was barely able to function. It took all I had to keep showing up at my job. I started leaving earlier so I wouldn’t risk running into Lena. I stayed indoors on Sunday and played games and drank until neither was fun anymore.

Mrs. Beverly noticed. It was impossible not to. She had my eternal gratitude at the time because she gave me a pass. She could tell something had happened, and she didn’t hold it against me. She even commiserated with me, telling stories about her heartbreaks and assuring me it would be okay.

Sometimes, we would just sit in silence, and she would rub my back while I cried.

One day, Mrs. Beverly grabbed my face and looked me in the eye. This was the sternest I had ever seen her. She looked almost angry.

“Get up. Get over it. You have a life to live,” she said.

She was right, and I knew it. It took a monumental effort, but I got up. I went home and poured out my liquor and beer. I cleaned up my space, which had accumulated trash and filth from two weeks of negligence. I found a few of the things Lena had left behind. It wasn’t a lot. Just some scrubs and other work related items that she kept at my place in case she needed to change. Some video games too. I considered throwing her stuff out, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it.

But I needed to get rid of them.

I had visited Lena’s apartment a few times over the past months when we were still on talking terms, so I knew where it was. During my two-week bender, I had thought about trying to visit so I could ask why she stopped talking to me, but I just couldn’t bring myself to face her. I was a bit better now, not as angry or as self-destructive. And a little part of my heart hoped that she had changed her mind.

I brought over the box of her things, and knocked on the door. Waiting on the doorstep, my heart was racing. I tried to calm it down. I didn’t want to look desperate.

I heard footsteps, and the door opened. My heart lifted then fell. I was immediately confused.

The person who answered the door was not Lena. It was an older woman with dark hair and sun-worn skin. I double checked I had the right address, and the lady confirmed that this was the apartment I was looking for. I asked if she knew where the previous owner had gone.

The lady looked at me weird. She told me she had been living there for the past two years.

I knew that wasn’t true, but something made me not press the matter. I apologized to her and left.

Nothing about this made sense, and something felt seriously wrong.

I went to the front office of the complex and asked for the forwarding address for Lena. I tried to seem nonchalant, but I don’t think I did a good job covering my feelings. The complex insisted there had never been a “Lena” living in that apartment.

I felt like I was going crazy. I was worried about late stage schizophrenia or some other mental disorder until I found pictures of Lena on my phone. I *knew* I wasn’t crazy.

I was starting to panic. I hadn’t said it out loud, but I knew something had happened to Lena. And it looked like the apartment complex was involved. With how sketchy the area was, the possibilities of what happened to her felt endless. Trafficking, gang violence, she could be buried somewhere in a shallow grave. I tried not to think too much about that last option.

I didn’t know where to start, but if Lena was in trouble, I needed to find her.

I thought about calling the police, but I needed proof first. Something more solid than just pictures on a phone. Otherwise, they might lock me up just for being crazy.

I paced around the room for hours, thinking about where I could search. I kept the blinds shut and spent the rest of my Sunday trying to figure out what to do. I couldn’t sleep, even though I tried. Images of Lena broken and bleeding kept appearing every time I closed my eyes. I ended up not sleeping that night.

It was still dark outside when my alarm went off. It scared me before I remembered what it was for: 

It was time for my shift at the Home.

I considered calling in sick. That was a big no-no, but if Mrs. Beverly could placate my superiors, I would be fine. I was in no state to work there anyways. I had the phone in hand, ready to dial the number.

Then I got an idea. I could narrow down when Lena went missing if I could confirm if she arrived for her shift at the Home that night. It wasn’t a lot, but it was something to go off of. In a few minutes, I was speeding in my car towards the Home.

When I got to the Home, I only stopped by Mrs. Beverly’s for a moment. I tried to keep it cool, but like always, she could tell something was bothering me. I reassured her I was okay, and then found an excuse to get out, saying something about refilling some supplies or getting some medication I knew we were going to need.

I didn’t do any of that. Instead, I went to my boss’s office.

It was on the top floor, and was in the same place where they kept the Home’s records. The receptionist was on break when I got there. The door to the office was closed.  I knocked, and no one answered. I started feeling panicked again. I needed to talk to her. Feeling impatient, another idea occurred to me.

During orientation, I had been told that there was a state-of-the-art camera system set up on the premises as part of the facility tour. It was to maintain resident safety, and could store up to a month of footage. At the time, they had shared the factoid to prove how impressive the Home was.

Now, all it meant to me was that there might be footage of Lena entering and exiting the building on the day she went missing.

I checked to see if the boss’s door was locked.

It wasn’t.

I celebrated my good luck and went inside. I only had a few minutes, and I was starting to get reckless. I needed to find Lena, even if that meant losing my job.

The office matched the rest of the Home. That is to say, it was old and stately. A mahogany desk was on the opposite end of the room with a great window of stained glass casting shifting colors as the sun rose over the mountains in the distance. It also made weird, spidery shadows on the floor that made my skin prickle. I chalked it up to nerves. I had never broken and entered before. There was a laptop open on the desk. I moved to it. The screen was black, but fiddling with the mouse brought the screen back to life.

I knew that the camera program was accessible through the wifi. The guards at the gate could watch the feed and keep track of the residents. I found an icon for the security company and clicked on it. The camera feed appeared on screen. It was thousands of small boxes showing the Residents and CNA’s about their morning routine. I found Mrs. Beverly’s screen. She was reading now, looking up at the door every so often.

I saw a tab at the top. It read “archived footage”. I clicked on it, and was barraged by a mountain of files. They were labeled by date and camera number, so I double checked which ones were attributed to Mrs. Beverly. Going back into the archive, I found the file with the correct camera number and date. I clicked on it and the video player opened up.

It started off with footage of Mrs. Beverly sleeping. I skipped around, and saw footage of me working. Then I skipped some more, but was greeted with only a black screen. There were white words superimposed on the black background.

It said “Footage moved to Secondary Storage.”

My heart dropped. What the hell did that mean?

I had never heard of Secondary Storage. I knew that the servers for the cameras were kept in the basement, but as far as I knew, that was all that was down there. And it was off limits to employees such as myself. It was one of the only places in the building we weren’t allowed to go.

It was a weak straw, but I was grasping at anything.

I looked around for my boss's keycard. If she was out and about, chances are she had it with her, but I needed to be sure. I pulled open drawers, and my heart leapt when I saw the little plastic rectangle with a picture of her on it. I swiped it, and made my way to the door.

That was when I heard footsteps.

I panicked. I ran to a closet on the other side of the room, and got in as quietly as I could. I closed the door so it only remained slightly open. The footsteps got closer, and I heard the door open.

Through the crack, I saw my boss enter the room.

She gave no indication that anything was amiss. She was looking at her phone, holding a container of yogurt in one hand, and a bottled health drink in the other. She sat down behind her desk, and absent-mindedly fiddled with the trackpad on the laptop

I bottled up a gasp. I hadn’t closed the camera window.

She didn’t look at her screen, but was shaking her bottle. I knew that any moment, she would turn and see the open program, and then it was only a matter of time before she found me. I clamped a hand over my mouth to keep from breathing hard and giving myself away.

My boss stopped shaking the bottle. My heart stopped as well.

She opened some drawers, looking for something. Her keycard grew sweaty in my palm.

She cursed. Then she stood up and walked to the door.

“I always forget the damn spoon.”

She closed the door behind her, and it took me a second to realize that she had been looking for a utensil for her yogurt. I almost laughed out loud in relief.

I got out of the closet, and out of the office. I tried to look as nonchalant as possible when I passed other CNA’s in the hallway. It took everything I had not to freak out at every little noise.

I went straight to the server room. It was in the basement, on the right corner of the manor. I tried the keycard on the door. The red light flashed green, and I heard the lock click. I went inside and the door locked behind me.

It was dark inside the room. The only illumination was some emergency lights, and the slight blinking of the servers. Even in the darkness, I was struck by the decadence of the space. I wasn’t familiar with security servers, but I knew that they weren’t usually carpeted spaces with wood paneling.

I started looking for anything I could use. I once again realized my stupidity when I came to the conclusion that  I had no idea how any of this worked. My fear was building with each second I stayed.

I saw a door on the opposite side. It had another keycard lock. Thinking there might be a terminal inside, I tried the boss’s keycard. The light flashed green, and I opened the door.

I still dream about what I saw next.

The area beyond was a long hallway, lit by ancient, yellow electric lights. It must have gone on for 200 feet until its dead end. Wooden filing cabinets built into the walls were layered up to the ceiling. Each was set with a metal panel engraved with a name. Near the door, I saw a name that I recognized.

Mrs. Beverly.

I didn’t even consider what the implications of this hallway were. I was desperate to find out what happened to Lena. I took a risk, and reached up to pull the cabinet’s handle. It slid open on oiled hinges. Inside were VHS tapes, the kinds old security cameras used to use. Each was labeled with scotch tape and sharpie. I saw many names I didn’t recognize, then near the back I saw what I was looking for.

Lena. Night Shift.

I grabbed it without thinking, and shoved it into my pocket.

I left the hall, then went through the server room, closing the door behind me. I was about to cross straight to the door, when I heard something that made my blood run cold.

The beep of a keycard swiping outside.

I jumped behind another server. I heard the door open, then close. The emergency lights flickered, leaving the room darker than it was before.

Footsteps moved down the server aisles. I moved quietly, keeping myself out of sight of whoever was inside.  I moved from server block to server block.

I was three feet away from the door when I heard the footsteps stop. I don’t know if it was my imagination, but it seemed whoever was in here with me had halted where I had hidden just a minute before.

I couldn’t take it anymore. I sprinted for the exit. Swiping my keycard took an eternity, and I thought I heard whoever was in there begin walking towards me. The light flashed green, and I threw open the door and slammed it behind me.

It was almost too easy to get up the stairs and go out the back entrance. I sprinted down the halls, trying to be as fast as possible, forgetting stealth. Once outside, I snuck through the gardens to get back to the staff parking lot.

I knew I was going to lose my job, but I didn’t care. I needed to know what happened to Lena. I needed something I could bring to the police. I knew what I was doing was right, but I felt bad I couldn’t say bye to Mrs. Beverly first. She had done so much for me, been there for me when no one else was. I hoped that one day she could forgive me for not saying goodbye.

I drove back to the city, looking over my shoulder the whole way. I didn’t go home. I didn’t trust my apartment was safe. 

I needed to see what was on that tape.

There was a retro video store in the seedier part of town. Near my apartment actually. They sold old tapes, but for fifteen dollars you could buy porno VHS’s and watch them in a private viewing booth in a back room. Lena and I had found it when we had wanted to watch an old authentic Disney film, and were too cheap to pay for Disney+. The store owner had made some assumptions about us and made an offer. We laughed about it for weeks. But now, thinking about it gave me a lump in my throat as I went through the door.

I paid the fifteen, grabbed a random smut film from the stack, and closed the door to the booth. I pulled out the tape from my coat labeled “Lena” and slid it into the player. The screen came to life.

The video was dark at first, except for some white text that denoted date and time. Then the image appeared. It was Mrs. Beverly’s room. Lena and Mrs. Beverly were there, going about the nightly routine. There was no audio. I watched, and for an hour, nothing out of the ordinary happened.

Lena helped Mrs. Beverly into bed. I kept watching.

Another hour passed. Nothing.

I was feeling tired. My head hurt from my lack of sleep. My adrenaline was running out and it took everything I could not to doze off.

I was shaken from my stupor, when something on the VHS changed.

Mrs. Beverly was sleeping. Lena was reading in the corner. She stood up and stretched, then moved to go to the door. In the background, Mrs. Beverly was bolt upright in bed. I didn’t remember seeing her sit up. Lena didn’t turn. It didn’t look like she had heard her. She was writing a note on a nightstand, oblivious, as Mrs. Beverly slid out of bed, and moved behind Lena.

I felt sweat bead on my forehead.

Lena turned around, and jumped when she saw how close Mrs. Beverly was standing to her. Mrs. Beverly grabbed Lena’s neck with both hands. Lena struggled for a moment, reaching for her neck, then began to twitch and seize, her arms jumping as they tried to grab hold.

Mrs. Beverly’s arms began to expand and contort. Lena’s body became emaciated, like the blood and water was being sucked from her. Her clothes fell off her shriveling form. Mrs. Beverly expanded and bloated like a balloon. Her ankles, calves, and face swelled. Her veins stood out on her skin like roots and her mouth lolled open, her tongue stretching out the corner of her mouth, dripping clear liquid.

Then everything that was inside of Lena began traveling through Mrs. Beverly’s fingers and into her body. 

Lena’s body contorted and bones became displaced as her innards traveled up the length of Mrs. Beverly’s arms. It was as if they were conduits to her insides. Her hands and arms expanded to account for the muscles and organs that made their way into her own form. Lena’s mouth was open in a scream I couldn’t hear. Her body became limp, and empty.

It took fifteen minutes. The last thing of Lena to go was her skin, which melded to Mrs. Beverly’s hands like a floppy conjoined glove.

Mrs. Beverly was unrecognizable. She was bloated with strange shapes coming out of different areas of her body. Sharp points of ribs barely contained within her skin. She closed her eyes and collapsed upon the ground.

There was a second where nothing moved.

Then Mrs. Beverly’s form began to boil. Her skin became shapeless and it was like watching some terrible soup of human flesh tremble and twist. Things moved around inside of her, things that pressed up against the surface until the skin was almost translucent. I couldn’t look away. I hated it, but I couldn’t stop watching.

After thirty minutes, a healthy, naked, normal looking Mrs. Beverly lay sleeping on the ground.

The video ended.

I never went back to my apartment. I went to a branch of my bank and withdrew all the money I had. I went to the airport and bought the furthest plane ticket I could find. I left the tape in front of the police station in a paper bag with the word “Evidence” written on it.

I was a coward. I should’ve stayed and made sure it got in the right hands. I should’ve done more, made sure that whatever was going on at the Home was stopped.

That was a year ago. I’ve been living off the grid since, using cash, and renting apartments that don’t require personal records. I do risky construction jobs, pick fruit, mow lawns. Anything where they hand you the money and don’t ask questions.

But I know now I haven’t run far enough. For the past month, I’ve felt people watch me when no one was there. I come back home, and people have been through my things. Sometimes, at night, I hear things move around in the dark. I don’t know how much longer I can last.

There’s a reason I haven’t said the location of the Home, or even which state it’s in.

I can’t remember.

The moment I left the city, it was like every detail about the location disappeared from my mind. No address, no map. I can’t even remember my old apartment address. When I went to check my old mailing addresses on Amazon, there’s a blank space where it should be.

I can’t find any evidence of the Home or the city. Sometimes I wonder if I’m going crazy.

But I know it’s real. I can’t forget what I’ve seen.

Lena deserves justice. People need to know.

But it’s only a matter of time for me. The Home never lets go. Maybe I got out so easily because it knew what it would feel like to be away. Even if I can’t say exactly where it is, I know I can find my way there. It’s like a sixth sense that sits right underneath my collar. Sometimes when I can’t sleep at night, thinking about all the horrific things I saw, I hear the Home calling to me, asking me to return.

We didn't see that and were not in a position to go get it either so someone else must have. We complained and got a re- delivery, but the coffees turned up and the second delivery person spilled one. He even felt bad and wanted to pay for it but I told him no don't worry I'll just talk to the app and get it worked out. I reported it and instead of giving me the choice they just issued a partial credit. I mean I just wanted a coffee but apparently that wasn't happening. I went to talk to someone as I rathered a partial refund.

I screenshotted everything but the latest was that I contacted them and wanted to speak to their supervisor. They said this will happen in another 24 hours but I have my doubts.

1n6icyb,https://www.reddit.com/r/InternalFamilySystems/comments/1n6icyb/routine_police_work/,Routine Police Work,"I love that at this point (2.5 years into IFS), talking to a new part is so commonplace and casual. No braggies. 

I like to frame it in my mind as ghost hunting or being a detective (Olivia Benson SVU style). 

I broke up with my partner yesterday, which I have no parts objecting to. They just aren’t the right fit, and through IFS I’ve grown to value myself in ways they were never able to see or honor that value. 

But sitting having coffee this morning, I thought about the idea of meeting someone new and I felt like a chain around my heart. A slow and heavy anxiety - think like a villain putting someone in a tank and filling it up with water while sharks encircle you. The clock was ticking.

So…while drinking my coffee I just sweetly said “what are you doing there?” And at first the part was my thoughts saying “no one will ever love you” but then pretty quickly it could only respond by scrunching up my face and answering yes or no questions. An overwhelmed and restricted feeling in my throat. 

I calmly and lovingly interrogated her. Jessica is 8, showed up for me in 3rd grade, believes I am fat and ugly (thanks to trash stepmother and stepbrother) and that even thinking about dating is opening us up to further confirmation of that truth that I am worthless. I thanked her for everything - it probably took about 40 minutes - I felt the pain with her, held her. We visualized a limitless playroom where she can play pretend where there are no mirrors and no access for anyone who isn’t allowed. She did not want to trust me, so I just kept making space for her and understanding why it was hard, and telling her things about me that negate the “truth.” 

I don’t feel the anxiety anymore. Jessica is at peace. 

I am sure other people do this but I wanted to share in case something about my approach can unlock how to resolve someone else’s parts. 

TLDR (but you should because it’s good) Framing it as a detective really helps me, and being brave to face the pain for the part and give it the support it didn’t have at the time is like - an unparalleled healing gift you can give yourself. My life is soooooo different than it was when I started.

[100$] Aliexpress.,"Did capsules for a while and recently went back to filter. Upgraded from a cheap machine with pre-ground coffee to something better. I bought a Moccamaster and a Wilfa Uniform grinder. I knew the Uniform was not able to do espresso, I didn’t care.

I’ve been wanting a hand grinder that I could take with me when visiting friends and family. Some people bring wine or flowers; I like the idea of bringing specialty beans and freshly grinding them to make after-dinner coffee a bit more special. Sometimes I bring homemade ice cream, but that’s time consuming and usually more expensive than just bringing coffee.

I fell down the rabbit hole and bought a Kingrinder K6 that also is good enough for espresso. So i ended up with a used Gaggia Classic 2019 as well. I tend to go a bit overboard with hobbies early on and buy quality to avoid upgrades later. This is my reason for the Gaggia instead of something cheaper like the Delonghi Stilosa. 

I could see myself investing in an electric espresso grinder, maybe a PID mod, or even a Gaggimate. But for now, I just need some essentials. Local options are limited and importing often means high shipping and import tax.

I’ve had good experiences with AliExpress before, as long as you stick to reputable sellers, prices are usually better. Shipping is free, and import fees are calculated at checkout.

What gear can I safely “cheap out” on, if I stick to AliExpress. Without sacrificing too much? 

Could do Amazon, but then i want to wait till black friday.

I found the TIMEMORE Black Mirror Mini for about $40 cheaper than any local online shop. Are there other equipment worth grabbing?

Originally from Oceanius I, he was a former fraudulent tuna fisherman and killer of marine fauna. One day he encountered a super predatory tuna, he almost died (being partially mutilated) and saw it as redemption. Since then he loves tuna and wants to defend wild marine fauna.

● William called Barbed-Wire-Beard: Leg like a wooden leg but with a built-in shotgun. Eye patch and plasma double-barrel in hand. To top it off, he has a beard made of barbed wire. In his words, to better protect his neck. Former corsair of the oceans of Albarossa. He committed obscene acts, collaborated with Baltazar de Sangre for shared loot (without being betrayed) and took countless lives. After a failed boarding, he decided to change his life and ask for forgiveness.

● Jaques Fontain le Palizade: giant with Block arm-Shoulder with built-in heavy laser machine gun and attached grenade launcher. The other arm incorporates a retractable circular saw! Originally from Stellaria, he was an illegal lumberjack (cutting down forbidden trees), famous for building anti-animal palisades. He was mauled by a pack of 3 Puma-Jaguars that broke through his wooden barrier. Surviving by miracle, he realized that the palisade had to be built inside himself, to protect his soul from moral corruption.

● Pietro Called Holy Rocket: Telescopic eye with assisted targeting HUD and included laser pointer. He has an incendiary missile in his rib cage that comes out of his back on command via launch system! He defines himself as a “one-man missile system”. He was a fraudulent ex-priest, who confessed escorts (sometimes even in bed) and stole money from village churches. His good life ended when, while tending the church garden, he came across an old inactive war missile. Hitting it with a shovel by mistake, he caused an immense explosion that left him mutilated and changed forever. Since then he prays to Saint Cannon, Patron of soldiers, in search of redemption.

● Iron Jaw-Joe: A borderline ex-colonial government soldier, almost dead because he accidentally swallowed nitroglycerin together with his morning coffee. He has a steel jaw to chew ammunition and “load them” into his machine gun arm through a digestive system adapted as a belt-fed magazine! He never talks about his past, appearing cocky and arrogant, even though every night he dreams of his victims killed by atrocious and heinous acts, and regrets it all.

I have been paying for my VIP all the time, not only when I was actively playing but just in general, to support the game that I love. Grabbed the year-around sucbscription and just let it renew itself over and over and over again.

I returned to the game from a hiatus and decided that I want to buy some Lotro Points. And I coulnd't. I tried 3 bank cards and they still woulnd't work because, apparently, my bank card had to be issued in the country I currenlty live in. Alright, I thought, what seems the be the problem, officer, right? Wrong. It simply won't let me use ANY bank card to pay. I tried all the advice I found online and nothing worked. So, I filed a ticket and started waiting.

At this point it's not about the lotro-points, it's about the renewal of my subscription because I can't use my previous bank card anymore and, at the same time, I can't add another card. It simply won't let me to. Freaking amazing.

Meanwhile I learned that there are A LOT of people with the same problem that are waiting for the support to reply to them for MONTHS.

I get it, there has been a lot of things to do with the transition to 64-bit servers (and don't get me even started on this one!) and the Support has been working on the tickets related to this very issue. And, guess what? I. Don't. Care. I don't care that they have been moving things around, okay? I am a paying customer, I have been supporting this game financially for a pretty long period of time, and when it is their turn to support me, to help me out with my problem, I get nothing. You don't get in a cafe, pay money and get a reply ""okay, sorry, we are having so many orders right now, we can't tell you exactly when your coffee is going to be ready, just stick around and wait, eventually we'll give you the thing you'd paid for"".

I saw people defending the slow support system saying that oh, it's a small company, they don't get enough profit... OF COURSE THEY DON'T! Because I am trying here to PAY for the game and it seems to be an impossible quest to accomplish! I am literally chasing them with ""shut up and take my money!"" and they won't do that!

I used to let my subscription run even when I wasn't playing the game. I guess, not anymore. This is ridiculous and disrespectful at the same time.

I have some experience working at Support, and that is NOT the way you treat your customers.

# Routine habits still change as summer turns to autumn

**By GRACE SAMUELSON**  
**PART I**

Nature turns the page from summer to fall, and now. as in “the good old days”, our routine habits change. In my day school always opened the day after Labor Day. Now our grandchildren may start as early as the middle of August. To us then, that new blue or pink checked gingham dress and new hair ribbons were essential. Likely now, Levis and a T shirt bearing a message provides a wardrobe.

Those were busy weeks. Our mothers would shrink the materials for our new dress, then soak it in salt water for at least an hour to set the color, hang it on the clothesline to dry, sprinkle it and wrap it well rolled up so that the old iron flatirons, heated till they sizzled when touched with a wet finger, would smooth out the wrinkles.

Meanwhile, there were “slippey jims” to put up, tomatoes to can, green tomato mincemeat to make, apple jelly and sauce to can besides family meals to prepare without benefit of microwave. And, always, staring us in the face, the thought of that horrendous fall cleaning.

Our mother, a sentimental soul, was forever quoting poetry; she learned reams of it while attending school in Jacksonport in the 1880’s, where Mr. Langemak held sway. Later, she taught out in Nasewaupee. Without fail, the first day of school she’d recite Whittier’s: “Still sits the schoolhouse by the road, A ragged beggar sleeping; Around it still the sumac grows, And blackberry vines are creeping.” We’d also hear: “School days, school days: Dear old golden rule days. Readin’ and ‘Ritin’ ’n ’Rithmatic, Taught to the tune of a hickory stick.”

At school we had to memorize, “The golden rod is yellow; the corn is turning brown. The trees in apple orchards with fruit are bending down.” We would come home from that first day of school, eager to report on the new teacher, whom we had already decided was going to be crabby, or nice; those “awful boys” who teased you on the way home, or the new pupils, wearing “new-fangled” clothes. We interrupted each other, so anxious to be the one to tell important news, till Papa would say, “Hold on a minute! One at a time! No tattling, now.”

Old expressions would creep up: “Why he doesn’t know beans from peas with the bag open!” “You don’t even know **beans!**” Papa might tell us about an irresponsible person: “He hasn’t got sense enough to come in out of the rain.” Or, “You might just as well go out and try to talk to the pump.” When we got to wishing for all kinds of things, we’d hear, “If wishes were horses then beggars might ride.” You weren’t just tired, you were “all tuckered out.” A restless soul might be “hopping around like a chicken with its head cut off.”

It was good to slip back into school routine; good to be with friends from across town you hadn’t seen all summer. Our new, or refurbished clothes were laid out in readiness the night before, and we were actually eager when we heard our mother call: “Girls! Get up! Time to get ready for school.” We’d race to get dressed in our slips, run down to wash in the basin of warm rain water from the reservoir. Grandma would help the younger ones braid their hair or turn Marian’s red curls expertly around her finger. She had a tight hand with hair, pulling it back so you felt your eyes pop, but she could tie a lovely bow in your hair ribbon, and she softened the strained back hair by telling you stories about when she was a little girl.

The little things are what you recall most: oatmeal cooked overnight on the back of the range (or the coal stove, in cold weather). Carefully skimming the big crock of milk in the cellar; carrying up the small pitcher of thick cream for parents’ coffee and our cereal, and the big pitcher of milk to set on the table. Sometimes, when there was an electric storm, the milk would sour. Then Mama would use the “clabbered” milk to make pancakes or Johnny cake. We took for granted a meal of bacon and eggs, since we hadn’t heard of cholesterol.

And we had no concern whether there was or wasn’t fluoride in the new Colgate’s “ribbon-dental cream.” No one knew about potassium levels. We got our vitamins somehow or other, because we were told to eat the things that were good for you. Our table didn’t seem completely set until the cut glass vinegar cruet stood at Papa’s place, handy to douse the usual Saturday night baked beans with vinegar and sugar, or to pour it on his tomatoes, or sliced cucumbers. Mama preferred her cucumbers in cream. Old Dr. Kruetzer warned us never to eat the peelings of the cukes and to be sure to cut the ends off down to the seeds. He said he knew a girl back in Germany who died from eating cucumber ends! Naturally, you soaked the cucumber slices in saltwater for an hour before fixing them for the table.

Our beds had to be made and the breakfast dishes done before we were allowed to start for school. I was a dreamer, consequently always leaving at the last minute. Papa used to say I’d run through the alley past Hutto’s, like a shot out of a gun. Mama had packed a lunch for Papa and he left about 7:30 on his bicycle for the bank in Sawyer. We all walked to school. The kids from out Evergreen way had to get an early start, as did the ones from the Cove, and down by the quarry. The Sawyer kids, when they went to high school, had to walk across the bridge four times a day. If you lived far enough out you were allowed to bring your lunch, and eat in the gym. Or, if a storm threatened. We loved the storms that gave us an excuse to run down to Schmidt’s bakery and splurge on sweet rolls or glazed doughnuts. Mama’s home-baking we enjoyed, but Schmidt’s was a luxury.

No racks in the stores then, with potato chips, cheese puffs, or tortilla chips. A **dip** meant going for a swim; a **spread** was to put on a bed, or spread creamery or dairy butter on your bread. No sugar-frosted cereals then. Cold cereal meant corn flakes or grape nuts. No Dagwood, Poor-boy, submarine, or hero sandwiches. You carried what was available for the season, or your purse. There was always Cracker-jack, with its bonus prize.

In later years, when I carried lunches to the schools where I taught, I had both variety and monotony. Sometimes the sandwich that had stood until noon wrapped up in wax paper and stored in a cardboard candy box, left something to be desired. (Like sardines, fried egg, hard summer sausage, or cheese.) I still remember the luscious olive-nut sandwiches the lady in the tea room made for me when I had Tuesday lunch duty in Bethlehem, and the little boy who always offered me his hearts-of-celery. The time I actually got tired of chicken, when our landlady culled her flock and we had stewed chicken every night for three weeks, and chicken sandwiches at school. The sight and the smell of some of the pupils’ lunch pails: unaired, unwashed, and reeking with garlic; jammed with hunks of dry bread or cold pancakes. The eighth grader in my first school who would fix whipped cream and sliced banana between graham crackers for our dessert when her mother ran out of cake for the lunch pails. Our hot lunch program in that school was soup, chili, or Spanish rice, cooked on the big jacketed furnace at the front of the room. At another school we heated the pint jars of soup, stew, or whatever the children brought in a boiler on an oil stove. We hadn’t heard of pizzas or sloppy Joes. After-school lunch was a “stepmother” (thick) slice of bread and butter, covered with brown sugar, molasses or Karo.

1n6i0mz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningDeco/comments/1n6i0mz/should_you_trust_energizer_aa_batteries_pack_for/,Should You Trust Energizer AA Batteries Pack for Daily Power Needs?,"Energizer AP91DP-32 was a product I was initially indifferent about. I mean, how much excitement can batteries bring, right? But using these double AA batteries daily for weeks has completely changed my perspective. From powering my wireless mouse to my kid's endlessly needy game controllers and even the family's assortment of flashlights, they’ve proven themselves crucial in everyday life. With a pack of 32 batteries, it almost felt like I unlocked a never-ending vault of energy, and, surprisingly, they’ve held up better than expected.

**Design and Packaging**  
The packaging is straightforward; a durable cardboard base securely holding the batteries in place. It’s not fancy, but it keeps things organized. What caught my attention first was the mention of including recycled materials—up to 10% recycled steel. This nod towards sustainability is refreshing. Each battery is clearly labeled with the Energizer branding and designed to provide robust performance in multiple devices. They’re compact and thoughtfully designed to fit snugly even in tight battery compartments, which is a significant improvement over certain generic brands where I’ve struggled with mismatches.

**Reliability in Everyday Devices**  
I run through batteries in my wireless mouse like my dog goes through treats, but these didn’t need replacing nearly as often as other brands I’ve used. They power up consistently without the random spurts of unreliability some cheaper options suffer from. Whether it was working with a flashlight during a power cut or ensuring my thermometer was up and ready, the dependability was palpable.  

**Shelf Life Is No Joke**  
The claim of a 10-year shelf life intrigued me. I tested a battery from the pack after leaving it untouched for weeks to mimic a storage scenario. Hands down, the power output was just as impressive as a fresh one. For someone always stocking up on emergency preparedness items, this was a significant win—they’re essentially the doomsday-prepper’s dream.

**Check Energizer AP91DP-32 deals on Amazon now.**  

**Good Attributes**  
• Exceptional reliability in emergency and daily use  
• Long 10-year-shelf life ensures backup power availability  
• Compact design for easy fit into a variety of devices  

**Weaknesses**  
• The pack doesn’t offer multiple size options, such as AAs and AAAs together  
• It’s on the heavier side when you carry the full 32-pack around, which is a slight inconvenience for traveling

**Performance in High-Drain Devices**  
Higher-drain electronics like VR controllers chew through batteries faster than I can sip coffee on a Monday morning. So, I slapped these into my VR remotes with a skeptical mindset. Pleasantly surprising was how long they lasted—far better than certain fancy rechargeables I’d been dabbing into. These definitely shine best in high-drain environments.

**Alternative Products**  
Comparing these batteries to competitors like Duracell Coppertop and Amazon Basics Alkaline AA Batteries was necessary. While Duracell offers similar reliability, they’re often priced slightly higher for a similar count. Amazon Basics, on the other hand, offers good value but falls short in long-term storage. Energizer hits the sweet spot with performance and lifespan, especially for emergency stashes. I'll admit, however, that there are more affordable options for casual use, but if you prioritize consistent performance, they’re a standout.

**Bang for the Buck**  
In assessing the affordability versus performance equation, these certainly lived up to their worth. They may not be the absolute cheapest option, but the consistency and longevity they bring to the table make them a worthwhile investment. It’s especially rewarding if you often power more demanding devices. Personally, I’d rather invest a pinch more for something I trust rather than deal with the frustration of premature failures.

1n6hzgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1n6hzgf/aitah_for_ruining_my_coworkers_ai_assistant/,AITAH for ruining my coworker's AI assistant?,"First of all, throwaway account because some of my coworkers follow my main. Second of all, English is not my first language so if there's any errors or confusing parts, that's why.

For a bit of backstory, I (25M) started at the company around 3 years ago as an intern. As per tradition in the company, I started in QA, making sure our products would be of high quality but when I got my engineering degree I was given the offer to switch to one of our programming departments and work full-time.

When I switched to this department I got to know one of my coworkers (49M) whom I simply hate. For the sake of fluidity of my little storytime, I shall call him Dan. I had known of Dan before as it was my job to message this department about bugs that came up and what triggers them, etc. but I had never imagined he would be an even bigger idiot than I imagined him to be back during my time in QA.

Dan is an enthusiast of AI. I, of course, know of AI as well but try to avoid it as I am still learning and AI only degrades your progress if you use it excessively. Dan uses AI for everything. Not just things inside but also outside of work. And frankly, I couldn't care less about what he uses AI for in his free time, but really my issue lies with the fact that about 95% of his code is generated with AI. Pretty much anytime I glance over at his screen, Claude is open. At times ChatGPT stays open. (I don't know why he uses both and frankly, I don't care but I am naturally very investigative so sometimes when he leaves the computer unlocked (and that happens a lot) I read his chat history briefly and marvel at how incompetent he is.)

I recently went out for coffee with a colleague (26M) who works in the QA department and he complained how over the last months the number of bugs has risen. He said he knew that that might happen since the project we're working on now is of a larger scale than our previous one but he found it suspicious how much worse the quality of the code got. I instantly knew who was at fault (Dan) and since I am somewhat protective of this QA colleague of mine because I have a crush on him, I just felt a great urge to make his life better and Dan's life worse.

I knew I couldn't get help from management since some of our bosses are somewhat convinced that AI will save us all and make us 300% more productive. Basically, I knew I had to depend on myself. So one time, Dan stayed signed in on his computer after he left work. (Which he does regularly, by the way. Not just staying signed in while he has a break, staying signed in while he goes home. The cybersecurity people hate it.) I took the opportunity and changed the settings of his AIs to reply that they are unable to produce code this way due to newly imposed limitations on the software or some other suitable BS.

Anyway, it's been around a week since then and Dan has been struggling. He can barely keep up because his skills have degraded so much with his constant use of AI that he spends most of his days pretending to work. He's tried some different AIs as well but none seem to cut it for him. Either way, if he finds a new one to be his best pal, I know what to do.

Anyways what prompted me to post this is because yesterday Dan accused me of messing with his computer because we've argued about AI in the past. I shrugged it off, telling him I've read some article about how recently some models have started to go haywire and it seemed like he believed me but he looked so panicked that I felt bad. On the other hand, though, my crush told me that it seems like what we have now is much more stable.

I'm left feeling conflicted but I can't ask my coworkers for validation because even though many would be happy about Dan's downfall, I can't risk word travelling to Dan or management. So, AITAH?

1n6hygc,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1n6hygc/do_heartbreakers_even_care/,Do Heartbreakers Even Care?,"I'm currently in a new relationship that's been rocky to start. I care about this girl a lot, and things started out well. We had a lot of passionate feelings, but shes recently scaled back and even said she no longer wants to remain exclusive with me. She's considering a future with me, but has gotten red flags as her girlfriends have accused me of love bombing. This isnt the first time I've been called this either. 

It had me thinking why does this keep happening? Why do I latch onto a partner with intense feelings? Is it because I wear my heart on my sleeve? Is it because im a hopeless romantic? After some reminiscing, and talking with life long friends, ive decided its due to all the traumas in my life around dating. For context, my upbringing wasnt the best. A chaotic childhood with parents fighting, a nasty divorce, homelessness, and being abandoned by one of my parents. Even with all that childhood trauma, the events that stick out to me the most are the heartbreaks. Those hurt the most. 

My first girlfriend who took my virginity was playing me and my friend at the same time. She told me she loved me for over a year as we were dating. The whole year she was sleeping with my friend behind my back. Another girlfriend who I grew very close with in my late teens ghosted me completely out of the blue. I found out she left me for my best friend who she had been talking to behind my back. I lost my best friend and my girlfriend on the same day. I had another girlfriend after whose parents hated me just because I wasnt wealthy enough to be with their daughter. I fought for 12 months to be with this girl, just for her to end it because he parents couldnt come to terms with us being together. I had a high school crush who I absolutely adored. I was best friends with her, but I could never tell her how I really felt. One day we were hanging out in my car when she kissed me. I was dumbfounded, but I went with it. We had a moment for a few weeks until she ghosted me. I saw her driving around with another one of my friends a few days later. In my 20s, I dated a really nice girl who I found was chatting with other men on a dating app. Naturally, I ended the relationship which hurt a lot, but it hurt even more when she sent me a self harm video saying this was all my fault. Fast forward to more recently. Last year I met a great girl. We hit it off, had a deep connection, and were building a tight bond. Then she texts me one morning to meet for coffee where she tells me she's been working on relocation at work thats been accepted. She's moving away and we wont be able to work long distance. This particular experience was so traumatic that SHE was crying while I had to console HER. The person who made this decision felt so badly about it that she was hysterically crying. So why make this decision??

Fast forward to today. I'm with someone new. We start out strong, but I'm quickly met with ""the talk"" where im told this needs to cool off and maybe we can rekindle later. Was I love bombing? Maybe, but if anyone gave a shit, they would get to know why I do this. A lifetime of traumatic experiences in relationships that were so bad that my childhood trauma pales in comparison. Do I have trust issues? Sure. But I think my trust issues are warranted. ",6,1756815642.0,heartbreak,7,1.0,False
1n6hwnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1n6hwnm/my_review_of_various_brewing_equipment_i_own/,My review of various brewing equipment i own,"I started my journey few years back with a Drip machine. Own like 4 different equipment now, so thought of writing a comparison post as most people on this forum are one team or the other...


1. Agaro Drip Coffee Maker: 3 years old, still fills the whole kitchen with amazing coffee aroma in the mornings... Beginner friendly, only variable is amount of coffee vs water. Little to no skill required. However, the coffee flavor is not as great as say French Press.

2. French Press: I use the Hoffman recipe here... brews a great coffee. The best Black coffee among the ones have tried. Also use this for cold brews, so another +. Only catch being, due to brewing time... coffee is ready at slightly lower temperature than the earlier method. So if am working and drinking, it often gets less warm by the last sip. If you are drinking immediately, it's a wonderful option. Some basic skill is required.

3. SIFC: The best coffee according to me (Am south indian, so kinda biased as I enjoy this since childhood). Easy to make. Can tolerate mistakes, low skill required. Can also brew chicory Blend coffee. Thanks to slow brewing, it extracts way more flavor than a Moka pot. Except the brewing time which is one of the longest... there's nothing you can complain here (~30 mins for 2 cups). 

4. Moka Pot: The most difficult to brew for a beginner and the most expensive setup among the four. It honestly punishes you if you make any mistake. It took me approx 10+ attempts to finally get the recipe right. E.g. most suggest using hot water in the bottom chamber, but I prefer dark roasts... so the coffee often comes out tasting just bitter. The solution was to use room temperature water instead. Makes a great cup of milk coffee in under 5 mins. So preferred if I want to drink coffee sooner than later.


Coming to my fav beans... Yet to buy a grinder (cost constraint)

100% Robusta Medium roast from Mercara gold estate at coorg. Used with both sifc and moka pot.

Cothas Hotel Blend, the OG filter coffee powder.

BT Vienna Roast for black coffees (i love bitter over acidic coffee) but currently overpriced.

Araku Signature for black coffees, recent purchase based on forum recommendation. Kinda enjoying it.

Note: I often purchase coffee from lower end of price segment,  so most fancy coffee brands haven't been tested yet.

I've been trying to restore my la pavoni eurobar 'de luxe' to full functionality. Bought it 5 years ago at a second hand (kringloop) shop in Amsterdam for 15 euros. It is the same as shown in this post of a guy who beat my price [https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1abxeh6/999\_thrift\_store\_find/](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1abxeh6/999_thrift_store_find/)  
Worked fine for years so all I have done so far is replace the shower screen - i.e the piece with little holes from which the coffee pours out- and the portafilter itself, a little o ring of the steam wand. Lately though it had been leaking slightly whenever the pressure got too high, seemingly directly from the boiler. so I took it apart and saw intense corrosion not in the boiler but in the lower alluminum part that holds the portafilter in a bajonet lock, attached underneath the boiler. Assuming that that could have caused the leak, I have replaced that lower portafilter-holding part. Initially managed to find it nowhere on the internet  but finally did find it here in Amsterdam (credits to Duikelman).  
Now I'm putting everything back together and realize the pictures of the wiring I took before disconnecting everything were not detailed enough, and I can't see where every wire should be reconnected to. Have been looking for diagrams but no luck so far. Feel kind of stupid, not an electrician at all. Does anyone have a diagram or maybe know another more intuitive way to safely reconnect everything...?

1n6ht0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1n6ht0c/quit_caffeine_for_3_months_after_years_of_heavy/,Quit caffeine for 3 months after years of heavy coffee drinking – barely noticed benefits. Worth trying again?,"I used to drink a lot of coffee for over a decade, around 4–5 cups a day. I felt very dependent, had gut issues, and poor sleep. I decided to quit caffeine. I tapered down with tablets, from 400 mg to 12.5 mg in 2 months.

I stayed off coffee for 3 months, but honestly didn’t notice many positive effects:

Sleep quality was still poor, no real change

Frequent brain fog

Even some depressive moods, no motivation


The only clear improvement was reduced excessive sweating – I sweated much less in the summer, which was a big plus - maybe this means less anxiety?

I went back to coffee after a tough situation (poor sleep + a long car drive), and now I’ve been drinking again for 2 weeks. Back to caffeine wasn't also nothing spectacular, just felt more awake. 

I have mixed feelings – no major negative or positive changes, apart from the sweating and reduced compulsive urge to drink coffee, plus saved lots of money for takeaway coffees.

Do you think 3 months is too short to reset the nervous system after so many years of heavy caffeine use?

For context: I live healthy, don’t drink alcohol at all, and I train regularly. I was hoping to see the big benefits people often describe here after quitting caffeine, but it didn’t really happen.

What advice would you give me? Should I try again later? Would you approach it differently?",3,1756815196.0,decaf,8,0.72,False
