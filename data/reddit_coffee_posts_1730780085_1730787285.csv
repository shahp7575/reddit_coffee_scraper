1gk09ie,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTherapist/comments/1gk09ie/how_do_i_stop_obsessively_thinking_about_certain/,How do I stop obsessively thinking about certain topics? ,"Hey I really should quit coffee but I decided to just drink a bit too much to hopefuly somehow help with it but I've been lately, for some time, not very recently, been thinking about various spiritual topics and such and I guess I just fell into it? It somewhat built up and then, like a spool of string or something, I just got wrapped up more and more into it and now can't seem to get out. I've always to some extent had some personal involvement in it but now its just filling up alot of my life basically daily and it feels like an obsession at least for the last few months....mostly started back around the start of the summer or something, it was a while ago honestly not all that recent. Sorry if my post is a bit rambly.

Issue is that I always keep coming back to spiritual things in some regard. It sort of shifts and turns and I just keep messing around with it, and I also have some paranoia issues I think that I tried talking over with with someone online who did virtual therapy which was great but they only offered a small limited amount of therapy sessions with the app and im not sure if its going to reset or not after December.

For paranoia its just a variety of things and honestly its worse if i have too much coffee, which is exactly what i've been doing lately. Issue was that I was just thinking overdoing coffee(2-3 cups at the moment and some tea for the past couple days) would be helpful. Genuinely pretty sure i've been slowly getting more and more sensitive to coffee cause now i notice issues after a couple cups over a few days while in the past I thought it didnt affect me at all. Alternatively I just didnt realize some things were paranoid related. (thoughts like getting worried someone i knew hurt another person or, or that everyone was talking down to me, comments were rude which in hindsight are ok, people reading everything i do and knowing everything i do online, certain people tasked with keeping track of benign stuff i do irl, ect). Dumb stuff, its dumb, no basis to think its happening and i think too much coffee helped me realize it. Or perhaps it just got really all up there and that helped me realize it.

So i kept obsessing over that somewhat but also over spiritual topics to the point of attempting/successfully attempting(yeah ik) to communicate with said entities and i mean i really should stop and its taking up alot of my thought basically daily I think? I think its daily but my mind keeps swirling bac to that topic over and over and if its not that its something related. I mean the lack of paranoia when i dont do coffee is ncie but it feels like if i dont have coffee i delve deeper into the spiritual aspect even faster.. then i do some coffee, it stops, then back again and i have no way to really explain that. I dont feel like i can talk about it with familly due to religiou reasons and i havent talked to a doctor or any sort of mental health professional irl.

Basically just need to stop obsessing over it and if its not spiritual things it just being able to sense thoughts ad whatnot absolute BS just fills my mind at random. Sorry this is long, very veyr very long. For that last part, I was sitting and quite frankly realized it was bs not just cause i had way too much coffee but also cause I was pretty certain i could feel thoughts, (not hearing them or anything just knowing they were there or emotions being emanated)...then i turned around and the people sitting behind me had left, so yeah that was BS clearly.

  
Also wtf I cant seem to keep my word count down on most anything, usually, theres occasional moments where I can or i dont produce automatically a grand sample of text but at this preset moment im not quite sure how to cut down without being meaninglesly verbouse. maybe i type too fast? I have no clue frankly.",1,1730787049.0,AskTherapist,0,1.0,False
1gk09gk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketing_Made_Simple/comments/1gk09gk/empowering_content_creators_essential_tips_for/,Empowering Content Creators: Essential Tips for Success ,"Starting out in content creation can feel like stepping into a fast-paced, ever-changing world where everyone‚Äôs competing for attention. To make an impact, you need to be adaptable, authentic, and ready to stand out. Whether you‚Äôre creating NSFW content or targeting a broader audience, these tips will help you thrive and build a memorable digital presence.


1. Build a Strong Personal Brand

   üî∏Ô∏è Define Your Unique Style: If you‚Äôre just another duck in the row, you‚Äôre easier to ignore. Flaunt your quirks and make them your trademark.

     Example: If sarcasm is your second language, make it work for you in your posts. Your followers will follow for your flavor.

   üî∏Ô∏è Consistent Branding Across Platforms: Your brand should be like your favorite conspiracy theory‚Äîimpossible to forget and visible everywhere.

     Example: Keep your username and visual style consistent; make it easy for your fans to stalk you, digitally.

2. Invest in Quality Content Production

   üî∏Ô∏è Upgrade Your Equipment: Nothing says amateur hour like pixelated video and echoey sound.

     Example: Invest in a decent camera and mic. Clean your lens, maybe? And remember, traffic noises aren‚Äôt considered background music.

   üî∏Ô∏è Learn Basic Editing Skills: Choppy cuts and prolonged silence are only cool in French films.

     Example: Cut out the awkward silences. Unless you‚Äôre going for an avant-garde vibe, keep it snappy.

3. Engage Authentically with Your Audience

   üî∏Ô∏è Interact Regularly: Treat your fans like your fridge; check in often, and always keep it fresh.

     Example: Respond to comments with the same enthusiasm you'd show a surprise pizza delivery.

   üî∏Ô∏è Value Your Fans: They‚Äôre the coffee to your overworked Monday.

     Example: Toss them a virtual high-five or an exclusive sneak peek. Everyone likes feeling like a VIP.

4. Leverage Social Media Wisely

   üî∏Ô∏è Choose the Right Platforms: Placing NSFW content where it‚Äôs not welcome is like wearing a clown suit to a funeral‚Äîwrong place, wrong time.

     Example: Keep it friendly on Instagram and unleash the racier stuff on Twitter.

   üî∏Ô∏è Avoid Platform Violations: Being banned is more outdated than flip phones.

     Example: Know the rules better than your high school handbook. Stay on the right side of digital law.

5. Protect Your Privacy and Safety

   üî∏Ô∏è Use Stage Names: Unless you want your grandma asking about your job at the next family BBQ.

     Example: Invent a stage name as cool as your alter ego deserves‚Äîthink Beyonc√©'s Sasha Fierce meets superhero chic.

   üî∏Ô∏è Secure Your Accounts: Because hackers have less chill than a horror movie stalker.

     Example: Strong passwords are a must‚Äî‚Äòpassword123‚Äô is just asking for trouble.

6. Understand Legal Obligations

   üî∏Ô∏è Stay Legal, Stay Free: Jail is a terrible place for content brainstorming.

     Example: Keep your paperwork as neat as your content calendar. Boring but necessary.

7. Diversify Your Income Streams

   üî∏Ô∏è Explore Every Avenue: Don‚Äôt put all your revenue eggs in one shady internet basket.

     Example: Mix it up with Patreon, merch, and direct sales. When one door closes, you‚Äôll have others wide open.

8. Network with Other Creators

   üî∏Ô∏è Team Up: It‚Äôs like a buddy cop movie but with more followers and less car chases.

     Example: Find creators who complement your style for collaborations that double the fun.

9. Prioritize Self-Care

   üî∏Ô∏è Set Boundaries: ‚ÄòNo‚Äô is a complete sentence and a lifestyle choice.

     Example: Know when to close the laptop. Your health is worth more than an extra thousand views.

10. Stay Updated with Industry Trends

    üî∏Ô∏è Keep Learning: The only constant in content creation is change.

      Example: Stay agile‚Äîwhen the next big thing hits, be ready to pivot faster than a cat gif goes viral.

üî∏Ô∏èüî∏Ô∏èüî∏Ô∏è

Dive into content creation with your unique voice, a clear strategy, and a touch of humor‚Äîbecause if you can make yourself laugh, chances are, someone else is giggling too. Keep these tips in mind, and you‚Äôll not only build a strong brand but also enjoy the ride. Remember, everyone loves a creator who doesn‚Äôt take themselves too seriously‚Äîexcept when it comes to privacy and legal stuff...

I'm 40M british guy who has been living in bangkok for the past year. I have made some friends/ connections but mainly with fellow expats and am looking to expand my social circle. I would like to open up myself more to thai culture and people or for that matter anyone who enjoys similar things as me or simply wants to hang out.

So a bit about me. I am quite an active person. I like to exercise and love mixing it up and trying new things. Currently getting Padel but also love football l, running, golf, pretty much anything.

Like most people I enjoy coffee, I enjoy beer and wine. I like listening to live music my favourite probably being rock but am pretty open to genres.
I have a nerdy side that enjoys fantasy genres from board games to scifi/ fantasy films. I love pub quizzes or any kind if general knowledge related stuff.

I also enjoy museums and galleries from time to time. 
I would say I am a bit of a functional introvert. Whilst I like socialising I tend to recharge best when having time to myself. If I was a car maybe you would call me a hybrid!

I am learning thai (only started a few weeks ago) but finding it quite challenging!

If anyone feels like any of the stuff above sounds
appealing then please feel free to comment or DM me and we can maybe meet up and/or do something fun.

(cocoapink)üíñ,"I ordered on sept 1 and received them on sept 26, so it made good time! I was quite ill when they arrived, so they had a couple weeks to rest. I'm pretty new to fragrances, but I know I like gourmands, coffee, some fruits(especially tart ones), tobacco, leather, frankincense, myrrh, and cautiously, some florals. I don't like anything that smells like an old lady or a metaphysical store. typically no white florals, rose, vanilla-dominant fragrances, patchouli, or sandalwood.

southern grace- Watermelon combines gracefully in this fragrance with black dahlia, freesia, lychee, pralines and a touch of vanilla musk.
smelling out of the bottle, I got subtle fruits and florals, but not in the most pleasant way. in an abstract way, it reminded me of a floridian nana enjoying the morning from her patio outlooking her garden, so it does live up to the name! I can't really pick out any specific listed note, but more like a general old lady-ish, sweet and natural scent. on my skin it only grew more stale. will destash. 2/5

jade iced tea- Black and green tea infused with ice cold shots of coconut milk, fresh sweet cream and sugar all poured over ice then accented with fresh peppermint leaves.
warm, sweet/autumn-spicy, and a hint of sharp green. doesn't really bring to mind jade? on my skin, I pull more of the milky-sweet elements, and as it dries down the teas become more dominant, kind of earthy-sour. this isn't really me; will destash. 2.5/5

peachy ginger tea- The perfect blend of white and green teas with fresh peach and ginger co2 and sparkling aldehydes.
out of the bottle it's a not-too-sugary peach ring and the carbonated ginger floats beneath the surface. I wasn't too sure about it initially, but the more I smell it the more I like it. unfortunately, the ginger-soda disappears almost immediately from my skin, leaving behind the teas with a gentle hint of fruit. any recs for another carbonated smelling perfume that will last longer? I was surprised by how much I love it! it's a fine fragrance, but I'm just so disappointed on how much it changed compared to a bottle sniff. may destash? 3/5

creamsicle- A delicious orange sherbet swirled with creamy vanilla.
this smells pretty close to its name. on my skin the vanilla really pops out. the sharpness of the orange fades a bit but I'm still definitely getting a little orange sherbet. this will be super cute for the summer or anytime. keep! 4/5

cream soda slushy- Ice cold cream soda, pear, caramel, butterscotch candies and fresh wild strawberries.
vanilla-y with some sour artificial fruit. on my skin I get way more caramel, butterscotch, and the fruits smell better. I got excited until it dried down more and went back to a weird, bad fruit that was too sweet. destashüò≠ 1.5/5

BONUS: cranberry noel- CP's exclusive tart cranberry with no spice notes, sweetened with vanilla bean noel.
this was a little sample they included, that was so sweet! and it was wonderful out of bottle, not too tart or warm or vanilla. it smells just as good dried down on my skin! I wasn't sure what to wear for winter, so I'm super excited, I think it's perfectly sweet, flirty, and festive. keep! 4.5/5

I learned I prefer perfumes with fewer notes, probably between 3-6. I'm also not a fan of green tea, but maybe I could try different teas, like earl grey? I'm not opposed to trying cocoapink again, especially from their fall/winter collection. maybe I'll stick to gourmands without fruit notes in them? overall, I'm not too disappointed. it's so much fun discovering what I like and what notes my skin brings outüíñ",1,1730786071.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

When to get professional help: a guide

At what point do you start to wonder if your severe procrastination is actually a symptom of a known medical condition or neurodevelopmental difference? What if, for many of us, this inescapable stuckness of procrastination could actually be treated and become a passing phase?

I know that many of us here already have (at least one) diagnosis that (at least partially) explains the severity of our procrastination, many of us even wear procrastinationism as a badge of honor (at least on this subreddit) because we have found a community who share our struggle, and a sorrow shared is halved. 

Our society treats procrastination as a moral failing, we must not be trying hard enough, we must not want bad enough to ""do the thing"". A lot of us know better than anyone how bad we want to do the thing. Why else would we be here? To brag about how many thousands of unread emails are in our inboxes? I recommend some subReddits down below where that topic comes up frequently.

Putting something off until tomorrow is the definition of procrastination. Begging yourself to start something but being unable to start it, the same way you are unable to intentionally touch a hot stove, that is actually called executive dysfunction, it's an explainable neurological phenomenon related to dopamine and other neurotransmitters responsible for motivation and self control within the brain. Markiplier described his executive dysfunction due to his ADHD as feeling similar to sandpaper rubbing against his brain where the friction increased the harder he pushed himself to do a task like practicing trumpet that he didn't find intrinsically enjoyable.
You can read more about executive dysfunction here.https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/23224-executive-dysfunction

I probably joined this subreddit five years ago while trying to find some explanation for the procrastination that was ruining my academic performance, my sleep schedule, and my life. A year later, I was lucky enough to get a full battery of neuropsychological testing done on me when I was freshly out of high school (I graduated by the skin of my teeth due to severe procrastination I might add) , and thanks to that testing, I was diagnosed with ADHD. they didn't list which presentation of ADHD I have, but I know that I have the inattentive presentation, rather than the hyperactive/impulsive ""stereotypical "" ADHD. For a while there, until 2021 or 2022,, I felt like the only person in the comments mentioning that others might have ADHD and that there are ways to get primary care doctors or psychiatrists or psych evaluations /Nuropsychological testing to help diagnose and treat ADHD in adolescents and adults. Nowadays, I am happy to see other people mentioning getting evaluated for ADHD when people post what are often textbook ADHD symptoms, and I feel like the Reddit algorithm just sends me the most obvious cases of ""undiagnosed ADHD posting"" because it knows that potentially saving someone's life from the suffering I went through is the only thing that will make me spend time on Reddit anymore.

here is a post I made in a similar sub that prompted many people to get diagnosed and 
To thank me for helping them turn their lives around:https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/s/df3S9SX0u8
 
below is a reply I recently made to another post in this sub, which  prompted me to write the above post:

You sound to me like you may just have undiagnosed inattentive ADHD. It's really shameful that these ""experts"" wouldn't even think to mention that you have textbook executive dysfunction and when this is your worst/most life impairing symptom, it's usually just inattentive ADHD, which used to be called ADD in the previous edition of the DSM  (Manual of psychiatric conditions).

A lot of people get diagnosed as kids, especially the hyperactive boys, but for girls who tend to present inattentive, and for the boys who might be ""daydreamers"" and those who can keep their hyperactivity in check/have internal hyperactivity of three or more trains of thought going simultaneously, and guys who have the inattentive presentation, if we don't get diagnosed in childhood, or if our parents or guardians are dismissive of the idea or just think that we have to ""try hard harder"" or some crap like that, we then keep raw dogging life and burning out in school and life and thinking everyone is pushing just as hard as we are (they aren't) and eventually when life gets too stressful and we finally cannot take it anymore, we start describing the life impairing symptoms that we have as adults, and the people around us just look at us like we have two heads for struggling this much with stuff like lateness or procrastination or playing too many video games or buying too much at the mall, because ""everyone does that"", this is similar to that ""we're all a little ADD"" crap, yes Karen, I know everyone can get distracted or addicted or do something impulsive or fixate on a hobby, but I'm A LOT ADD ALL THE TIME!

I've been on the highest tolerable dose of long acting stimulant medication for the last four years and it has changed my life, I also just started a medicine called guanfacine which has further improved things for me after a month of fatigue and figuring out when in the day to take it (early afternoon works for me, as it turns out)

Anyway, check out Youtubers with ADHD and go on  r/ADHD and r/ADHDmeme and see if you relate to some of the content there. It's normal to have imposter syndrome at first, if ADHD explains what you're dealing with, and especially if you find a treatment for it, it's normal to go through a grieving process of realizing how much easier you could've had it up until now.  Also, it's normal at first to think you're just lazy or broken like society probably told you up to this point, really the fastest way to understand what some symptom relief from ADHD is like is to try stimulant medication for a day or a week and realize how it improves your time perception and working memory and executive functioning and you can finally notice that pile of clothes in the corner of your room that had faded into the background, etc. It's like putting on glasses for the first time. There are also non-stimulant medications that can take up to a month to start having similar effects to the stimulants, but Non-stimulants are less likely to be abused by normies and so they're more accessible in many countries and many people have great results with them, although they have some potentially weirder side effects than the stimulants, the stimulants mostly have side effects you would expect from drinking too many cups of coffee, side effects of any medication often get better with time, or you adapt (if your hands get cold, get fingerless gloves).

There are other potential causes for ""executive dysfunction"" and I should probably just link you to an article but I should be going to bed soon, but again, if procrastination is your worst symptom, it sounds like ADHD. It sure was for me. Executive dysfunction can also come from depression, head trauma, an overactive freeze response due to complex PTSD, autism, and a variety of other things that don't come to mind at the moment, but if I had to guess, I would say that you were dealing with ADD, burnout, sleep deprivation, and the combination of sleep deprivation, minimal self-care, losing structure, lack of routines, insufficient nutritional food and physical activity, without these good things, you will pretty much stop producing the neurotransmitters that you need at the levels that you need in the places in your brain that you need them in order to have any motivation or to do anything that isn't addictive scrolling and YouTube watching for example. To overly simplify it, people with ADHD are only motivated by exciting things or, fear/urgency of deadlines, and if you get burnt out or exhausted, it may reach the point where you can't even motivate yourself with existential dread anymore, at least that's how bad things got for me before I got help. This ""interest based nervous system"" can change to what seems more like a Neurotypical ""importance based nervous system"" after many years in a highly structured environment or after many years on effective ADHD medication, or, ideally, both.


Good luck to all fellow procrastinators and recovering procrastinators! 

I urge you to put off something urgent but not existentially important, and to you instead investigate some of the links and recommendations I have provided :)

1gjzqx3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1gjzqx3/shaking_hands_issue_weird/,Shaking hands issue (weird),"For my whole life I‚Äôve been struggling with very strong trembling in my hands, very often whole body.
Since I was a child, family members were laughing at my tremors- even when I wasn‚Äôt stressed or anxious, it went on and on and now I‚Äôm 25 and still got the same issue. Most calming drugs don‚Äôt work- I‚Äôve tried Ashwagandha, over the counter stress relievers and nothing seems to work.
 
Most often it goes very high in intensity during situations I‚Äôve been through before- latest example of almost fainting due to trembling was when I‚Äôve been in Japanese school‚Ä¶ for first few months I‚Äôve had absolutely no issue with going to the whiteboard to write something down, however after some time I‚Äôve been getting these weird sensations- like a feeling of approaching threat- despite the fact that my head is clear, it seems like my body disconnects from the brain‚Ä¶ no matter how much coffee I drink or what pills I take it stays the same, that weird feeling of approaching doom for no reason. 

Very often I find myself twisting the same knob before I go to sleep dozens of times to make sure it‚Äôs locked, I push down the sink tap lever 5 times despite the fact that I see that water isn‚Äôt flowing‚Ä¶ Even the ‚Äúdevil‚Äôs lettuce‚Äù made barely any difference (including strong CBD drops), like when I was taking my dog out after smoking and I kept looking at my crotch asking myself ‚Äúis my D out?‚Äù‚Ä¶ which makes absolutely no sense! (It also happens when I‚Äôm not under the influence).

And yes- I went to a doctor as a kid‚Ä¶ all they did is scratch their heads, then they gave me some prescription kiddie stress pills that had 0 effect on me. They scanned my head and found nothing wrong.
What I find weird is the fact that if I don‚Äôt sleep whole night- the next day I‚Äôm the calmest I could be- my mood is good, my hands are still and I feel weirdly normal, but I know it‚Äôs terrible for the body.
Also, when I‚Äôm extremely pissed I feel like my mind cranks up to 200%, I find the correct words I want to say very quickly (especially in English- my 2nd language), in addition to that my hands are completely still and I don‚Äôt really have any ‚ÄúOCD‚Äù triggers I‚Äôve mentioned before.

It really seems to me like my mind is working in reverse sometimes- no trembles and clear mind during rage- yet when I‚Äôm supposed to be calm and used to things my mind is a mess and my body stops listening to me.

Now I‚Äôve moved to the US so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to afford help from a specialist‚Ä¶

Additional information:
- intense strength training (low decrease of shaking)
- High intensity interval/ long medium intensity cardio (good decrease but short lived)
- ashwagandha (didn‚Äôt notice any change)
- herb stress relievers (0 effect)
- alcohol (very good decrease, but dangerous)
- devil‚Äôs lettuce (low effect- sometimes increases ‚ÄúOCD‚Äù compulsions)
- cigarettes (more than one- increase shaking)
- cold shower (the longer the better the effect, but low duration)
- Wim Hoff breathing exercises (nice effect, but ends very quickly)

1gjzn60,https://www.reddit.com/r/TuscanyTourism/comments/1gjzn60/best_things_to_do_in_tuscany/,Best Things to Do in Tuscany,"When visiting Tuscany, most people ask about the activities in Florence, Pisa, Siena, or other specific places. But Tuscany is a big region. And that's why, as a local, I recommend knowing the best things to do in Tuscany before you come.

**Top 10 Things to Do in Tuscany**

Ready to get your Tuscany on? I was a travel guide for years, and this list of activities in Tuscany is everything you need, from art to history to wine to views. Here are 10 things to do to make your trip one to remember!

**Florence‚Äôs art and history**

Florence is where the Renaissance really comes alive. Start with the Uffizi Gallery ‚Äì it‚Äôs got works by the big names like Botticelli, Michelangelo, and Da Vinci. If you‚Äôre not an art lover, by the time you leave you will be.

After the Uffizi head to Piazza del Duomo where you‚Äôll see Florence‚Äôs stunning cathedral and the famous dome designed by Brunelleschi. If you‚Äôre feeling brave climb to the top for the best views of the city. And don‚Äôt miss the Accademia Gallery to see Michelangelo‚Äôs David.

Florence has amazing street markets too like San Lorenzo where you can shop for leather goods, souvenirs and snacks. Florence isn‚Äôt just a city it‚Äôs an open-air museum and even a short walk can feel like you‚Äôre walking through time.



**Wine tasting in Chianti**

A trip to Tuscany isn‚Äôt complete without tasting the region‚Äôs famous wines, especially in Chianti. Imagine yourself surrounded by vineyards tasting full-bodied Chianti Classico straight from the source. Many vineyards offer guided tours where you can see the entire winemaking process from grape to bottle.

Try places like Castello di Verrazzano or Antinori nel Chianti Classico where tastings often come with local snacks like cheeses, olives and charcuterie. Some estates offer cooking classes so you can learn to make Italian dishes and pair them with their wines.

Chianti is close to Florence so it‚Äôs an easy day trip but if you can stay overnight in a vineyard hotel for the full experience. Chianti isn‚Äôt just about tasting, but rather about soaking up Tuscany‚Äôs wine culture.



**Hot spring dip in Saturnia**

For a one of a kind and relaxing experience head to Saturnia‚Äôs hot springs. The most famous one is Cascate del Mulino a natural hot spring with mineral rich waters that stay at 37¬∞C all year round. The pools are terraced and flow down like waterfalls creating a natural spa.

Best of all it‚Äôs free to the public. Early morning or late afternoon is the best time to go as it can get busy, especially in the summer. Bring a towel, wear water shoes if you can (the rocks can be slippery) and plan to stay a few hours.

If you want to go luxury nearby resorts offer spa treatments and access to private hot springs. It‚Äôs the perfect way to unwind and soak up the beauty of Tuscany‚Äôs countryside.



**Drive through Val d‚ÄôOrcia**

Val d‚ÄôOrcia is the Tuscan countryside you see on postcards ‚Äì rolling hills, cypress trees, vineyards, and medieval villages. Start in Pienza a charming town famous for its Pecorino cheese.

Wander through the cobblestone streets (avoid high heels please!), try some cheese at a local shop, and enjoy the views from the town walls.

Next head to Montepulciano famous for its Vino Nobile wine. Visit a winery, taste some wine and stroll through the town‚Äôs beautiful piazzas. Don‚Äôt miss Montalcino home of Brunello wine.

This drive is all about slow travel ‚Äì stop for photos, have lunch at a countryside trattoria, and take in the views. Val d‚ÄôOrcia is a UNESCO World Heritage site for a reason and it‚Äôs the perfect way to experience Tuscany‚Äôs rural life.



**Explore Siena‚Äôs medieval town**

Siena is like stepping back in time to medieval Italy. The city‚Äôs centre is Piazza del Campo one of Italy‚Äôs most beautiful squares and the site of the famous Palio horse race.

Climb the Torre del Mangia for a view of Siena‚Äôs terracotta rooftops and the surrounding countryside. Siena Cathedral is a must-see with its stunning black and white Gothic design and intricate interiors filled with art and sculptures.

If you have time explore the quieter streets and check out the Contrade (neighbourhoods) that compete in the Palio.

Each has its own flag, colours and history so Siena‚Äôs culture feels very alive. Finish your day with a meal at a local trattoria where you can try traditional dishes like pici pasta and ribollita soup.



**Hike in the Apuan Alps**

If you're into hiking, the Apuan Alps offer some of Tuscany‚Äôs best hiking with views from the mountains to the sea.

One of the most popular hikes is to Monte Forato a peak with a natural arch that frames the sky ‚Äì a great photo opportunity! Pania della Croce is another favourite trail with panoramic views from the top. These hikes can be tough so bring sturdy shoes, water, and snacks.

And if you‚Äôre lucky you might see some wildlife or stumble upon a small mountain village where time seems to have stood still. The Apuan Alps are less crowded than other areas so you‚Äôll have a peaceful escape with breathtaking views. Definitely one of the best things to do in Tuscany.



**Explore Pisa beyond the Leaning Tower**

The Leaning Tower of Pisa is an icon but there‚Äôs more to Pisa than that. Start at Piazza dei Miracoli where you‚Äôll find the Tower, the cathedral and the baptistery.

Each of these buildings is beautifully crafted and you can spend hours here just taking it all in. Once you‚Äôve taken the classic tower photo take a walk through Pisa‚Äôs historic centre where you‚Äôll find shops, cafes and less touristy sights.

Pisa has a laid back vibe thanks to the university and it‚Äôs a fun place to spend an afternoon.

Grab a gelato and take a stroll along the river ‚Äì it‚Äôs the side of Pisa that most tourists miss, and that's exactly what you're in Tuscany for.



**Chill out in Lucca**

Lucca is a peaceful pretty town famous for its Renaissance walls that surround the old town. You can walk or bike along the walls and get a unique view of the city from above.

Inside the walls, Lucca‚Äôs historic centre is full of charming piazzas, medieval buildings, and little cafes. Don‚Äôt miss climbing Guinigi Tower where trees grow on the roof for a view of the town. Lucca is great for just wandering and taking in the Tuscan pace of life away from the big tourist crowds.

Stop for a coffee or a plate of pasta and enjoy a bit of old Italy.



**Visit San Gimignano‚Äôs medieval towers**

San Gimignano is known as the ‚ÄúTown of Fine Towers‚Äù ‚Äì back in the day, it had 72 towers of which 14 still stand.

Walking through San Gimignano‚Äôs narrow streets you‚Äôll feel like you‚Äôve been transported back in time. Climb Torre Grossa the tallest tower for views of the surrounding countryside. The town is also famous for its Vernaccia wine so a wine tasting is a must.

Grab some gelato from Gelateria Dondoli which has won awards for its unique flavours. San Gimignano‚Äôs history, architecture and Tuscan charm makes it a must-see.



**Take a cooking class in a Tuscan villa**

What better way to experience Tuscany than by cooking its most loved dishes? Many Tuscan villas and agriturismos offer hands-on cooking classes where you can learn to make handmade pasta, ribollita, and tiramisu.

Some classes include a visit to a local market to pick up fresh ingredients. Then you‚Äôll sit down and enjoy the meal you made, often with local wine.

It‚Äôs a memorable experience that will leave you with new cooking skills and a deeper understanding of Italian food culture ‚Äì and you‚Äôll have the recipes to bring a bit of Tuscany back home with you.



**Some More Information About Tuscany**

**What‚Äôs the best time to visit Tuscany for sightseeing and outdoor activities?** April to June and September to October are the best months to visit. The weather is mild, the views are breathtaking and the crowds are smaller than in summer.

**Do I need a car to explore Tuscany or can I get by with public transport?** A car is highly recommended if you want to explore the countryside, vineyards, and small villages at your own pace. While Florence and Siena are connected by train, many of Tuscany‚Äôs best bits are easier to get to by car.

**How many days to see the main sights?** 7 to 10 days for a good all-round experience for a trip to Tuscany. This allows you to visit the main cities like Florence and Siena, a few countryside towns and do some wine tasting and cooking classes.

**What to eat when in Tuscany?** Tuscan food is a highlight of any trip. Make sure to try pici pasta, ribollita (a vegetable soup), Florentine steak, Pecorino cheese and bruschetta with fresh tomatoes and Tuscan olive oil. Tuscany is also famous for its Chianti and Brunello wines.

**Are there guided tours for wine tasting and cooking classes?** Absolutely, there are. Many vineyards and agriturismos offer wine tasting, cooking classes and even truffle hunting tours. Booking a guided experience is a good way to learn from locals and get more into the Tuscany culture.",11,1730784678.0,TuscanyTourism,0,1.0,False

From nostalgic classics to regionally beloved finds, Canadian candies are more than just sweets‚Äîthey‚Äôre a taste of Canadian culture. At [**Candyville**](https://candyville.ca/), we‚Äôre all about bringing the best of Canada‚Äôs candy traditions to everyone who loves a bit of sugary bliss. Here‚Äôs a list of 10 must-try Canadian candies that will make you want to hop across the border (or at least, place an order).

**1. Coffee Crisp**

When it comes to the perfect combination of coffee and chocolate, Canada‚Äôs Coffee Crisp takes the cake‚Äîor the wafer, to be exact. Each bar is layered with crunchy wafer and creamy coffee-flavored goodness, giving you that energizing coffee taste without needing to brew a cup. A true Canadian classic, this is a top-seller at any Canadian candy store, and once you‚Äôve had a bite, you‚Äôll understand why it‚Äôs a staple up north.

**2. Kerr‚Äôs Maple Kisses**

Maple syrup and Canada go hand-in-hand, and Kerr‚Äôs Maple Kisses capture that spirit beautifully. These chewy toffees are infused with real Canadian maple syrup, delivering a natural sweetness that‚Äôs unmistakably Canadian. Every bite is like a mini-maple experience, making it the perfect souvenir candy to bring a bit of Canada home.

**3. Big Turk**

Big Turk is not your typical chocolate bar. Made by Nestl√©, it features chewy, Turkish delight-style filling coated in a layer of milk chocolate. The combination of gummy center and rich chocolate creates a candy that‚Äôs delightfully different from anything else out there. It‚Äôs a divisive one‚Äîyou‚Äôll either love it or hate it‚Äîbut for many Canadians, it‚Äôs a beloved favorite.

**4. Eat-More Bar**

Invented during the 1930s, the Eat-More Bar is a sweet piece of Canadian candy history. It‚Äôs a chewy blend of dark toffee, peanuts, and chocolate‚Äîa wonderfully dense snack that will satisfy your sweet tooth and your hunger at the same time. Its old-fashioned look and unique taste make it a popular choice among those seeking a taste of vintage Canada.

**5. Smarties (Canadian Style)**

While Smarties may look similar to M&M‚Äôs, these colorful treats are distinctively Canadian. They come in a rainbow of colors and have a creamier milk chocolate inside. Canadian Smarties also have a thin, crispy candy shell that‚Äôs less sugary than their American counterparts. The famous jingle, ‚ÄúDo you eat the red ones last?‚Äù is a memory for many Canadians!

**6. Thrills Gum**

Known as the gum that ‚Äústill tastes like soap,‚Äù Thrills Gum is truly a one-of-a-kind candy. It‚Äôs purple, floral-flavored, and has a somewhat soapy taste that divides candy lovers into fans and skeptics. Love it or hate it, there‚Äôs no denying that Thrills Gum is uniquely Canadian‚Äîand worth a try if you‚Äôre feeling adventurous.

**7. Crispy Crunch**

Created by Neilson in the 1930s, Crispy Crunch is a classic Canadian candy bar that offers a blend of creamy peanut butter and crunchy candy layers, wrapped in a smooth chocolate coating. If you‚Äôre a fan of peanut butter, this bar will hit all the right notes. Though it‚Äôs only available in Canada, Crispy Crunch has developed a fanbase worldwide.

**8. Glosette Raisins**

Glosette Raisins are one of those candies you‚Äôll find at the movies across Canada. They consist of juicy raisins covered in a smooth layer of milk chocolate, making them the perfect mix of fruity and chocolatey. They‚Äôre a bit on the healthier side of the candy spectrum, so you can enjoy a handful guilt-free!

**9. Maltesers Canadian Edition**

While Maltesers may be found globally, Canada‚Äôs version has a slightly different recipe that fans say tastes a bit more malt-forward than other varieties. These crunchy, malt-filled balls covered in milk chocolate are a snack that satisfies, and for fans of malt, the Canadian edition is definitely worth seeking out.

**10. Hawkins Cheezies**

Though technically more of a snack than a candy, Hawkins Cheezies are a must-mention. These are the Canadian answer to cheesy snacks but with a crunchier texture and sharper cheddar flavor. Their unique recipe and unmistakable bright orange color have earned them a loyal following across the country.

The rest was in my bowl on the coffee table. I sat up after my leg woke up. Then More conflict happened but it‚Äôs not really important, it was pretty distressing
 my mom says this is what happened, 
You were sound asleep the first time I asked you you didn‚Äôt respond then I asked you a little bit later if you wanted raviolis and you said yes and you sat up I asked you if you‚Äôre good with tomatoes and spinach and you said that‚Äôs fine. I brought the raviolis. I put it on the table in front of you. You picked it up and sat up. You said it first and then picked it up. I think you rested it on your knee and then you complained loudly and I thought you had hurt yourself like maybe dislocated an arm or something, but you said that your leg fallen asleep I took the bowl of raviolis out of your hand because it was partially sideways and half of it had fallen on the floor near your Feet. (I ‚Äúwoke up‚Äù about here) I told you not to step on the raviolis and I said it a couple times because you were moving your leg around, I think because your leg falling asleep and then I came back in and said Kaison be careful not to step on the raviolis. You put your foot on the floor and you said what? no, I didn‚Äôt realize that I thought a little bit of cheese fill out your bowl And then I scooped up the half a bowl of raviolis and put it in the trash and you were laying on the couch moaning. And then after doing a little cleanup, I stopped and asked you to clean up and then you got up and started cleaning up. 
My mom noted that I seemed pretty awake before I said I woke up, she was also worried this bc, she said that didn‚Äôt seem like anything I would have done, which from what she told me I agree.

The quality of rentals is absolutely crap for what you pay. Everything else is super expensive. And on top of all that, you have a job that pays far below the cost of living. Majority of us are scrapping by. 

I make good money. I'm single. No dependents. No debt (anymore). So Im doing okay. But with everything I mentioned above, I can not justify buying a home or even renting a home/apartment. It's quite literally $1900-$2200 a month + utilities for a small 500-650sq.ft basement unit while living under a family of 5. No joke. Iv visited listings like this. 

Currently, I live in a basement unit that's $1600 a month all inclusive. So it's really good financially. But my god is it ever bad for my mental health.

My neighbors straight up keep me up till 1 am every night. Watching movies really loud, stomping around above my room, talking, chasing their cats and dogs, and dragging their damn coffee table around so they can see their laptop better. It's ridiculous. And yes iv contacted them and spoke with them on multiple occasions. Nothing changes. They are also the landlords. And they aren't old either. Late 20s early 30s. Last week they kept me up for three nights in a row. I was and still am so tired.

I'll try not to ramble on too much. This stupid pain is honestly destroying my mental health and I'm feeling more and more hopeless with each passing day. 

I (25m) have dealt with lower back issues for years now. I'm 6'2, 260ish pounds, I've played guitar for over half my life, and worked as a line cook while chugging along through college for 7 years. Needless to say, I've always dealt with soreness. It's always been (for the most part) manageable though, and was always muscle related. I'm a big guy, but I was always active. 12 hour shifts weren't the most fun of course, but the most I would deal with was some soreness in the morning-- nothing an Aleve and some coffee couldn't take care of. 

9 months ago though is when the torturous hell that is sciatic nerve pain had started-- and it was caused by the most innocent act. My girlfriend and I were messing around with a rolling stool; she was sitting on it, and I was playfully swinging her around while holding onto her hands. All fun and games, until she lost her balance and started to fall. When I went to catch her, I felt this awkward, painful twinge in my lower back. Thought at first that I must've just pulled a muscle, but to play it safe, we decided to call it a night.

Over the next 24 hours, the pain grew and grew--escalating to a point where I collapsed onto the floor in our living room, shaking and sweating from pure agony. My mom (who is a nurse) have me a muscle relaxer and was massaging my back, while my girlfriend wrapped me in an electric blanket because I was shivering so badly. Now, I consider myself to have a HIGH pain tolerance. I have 30+ tattoos and a huge septum piercing, I've snapped my growth plate in my ankle as a teenager, etc.... nothing, and I mean NOTHING, has come even CLOSE to this level of pain. Everyone in this thread knows how indescribable and inescapable this stupid shit is. 

At first, I wanted to try to fix this on my own. I kind of *knew* that I probably needed to go to a doctor, but some bad prior PTSD relating to medical settings led me to settle for a chiropractor instead. To be frank, even with spinal decompression therapy, they did next to nothing for my pain. I took it easy for a good three months (not working in the kitchen at all), losing a ton of savings in the process. I finally said screw it and went back to work (with limited hours). For the next few months, I could only pull 6 hour shifts before the pain would get to be super rough, even with an Aleve. Even on my ""best days"", the pain has never dipped below a 5.

About a month ago, I was working a busy shift when the pain got so excruciating that I damn near collapsed on the kitchen floor. My manager let me go early, and I had to essentially crawl to my truck. My leg was shaking uncontrollably. Right then and there, I knew I had to do stop putting it off and get a medical professional's opinion. That night, I broke down sobbing in front of the urgent care doctor (which was quite embarrassing in retrospect, but I was hurting so badly that I didn't care lol).

Due to my physical appearance (I tend to go for the ""brutal aesthetic"", but I'm a teddy bear, I promise) and my emotional state, the doctors and nurses both kept scoffing at me and essentially saying ""we're not going to give you opiates"". I told them that I don't WANT opiates!! That, as a Criminal Justice major and someone who's about to enter the field, they scare the HELL out of me and, even though I don't have any substance abuse problems, they're not even something I'm willing to consider--I just want to stop hurting this badly! They were kind of shocked and went, "".... okay yeah let's get you an x-ray"".

X-ray came back, and all that was shown was ""Grade 1 Retrolisthesis of the last vertebrae, and narrowing of the L5-S1 disc"". The doctor gave me prednisone, some ibuprofen and muscle relaxers, referred me to Neurosurgery, and sent me on my way. When I asked her if I should worry if I'm going to be in this much pain forever, she nonchalantly went ""no definitely not, you'll be fine"". 

So, a month's wait until the appointment. I figured that until then, I needed to get a general health checkup anyways, so I found a PCP. He was MUCH kinder and more receptive to me. He prescribed me a very low dose of gabapentin (again, I voiced my concerns about medications) and, while he agreed with the urgent care doctor that he didn't think my sciatica would be a huge deal and that I'll be able to heal, he was so much nicer about it. 

After a month long wait, I finally see the Neurosurgeon. This doctor saw my chart and was so nonchalant about what I was dealing with that his attitude essentially expressed a ""that's it?"" sort of approach. He ordered an MRI to be done NEXT month (why is everything a month apart!?!?), put me on 500 MG naproxen and more muscle relaxers, referred me to Physical Therapy, and said ""do a bunch of PT until we get the MRI back. I doubt we'll have to but worse case scenario, we'll do a microdiscectomy"". Again, he was SO DISMISSIVE of it! I asked him if he's comfortable/experienced with MDs and he just went ""yeah, I do 'em every week"". When I asked HIM if he thought I'd be suffering from this pain forever, HE was like ""nope, definitely not"".

So here I am, 9 months into severe, chronic, constant pain, and it feels like there's no escape or end in sight. I know that I don't have an MRI to show yet, and I know that THREE DOCTORS agreed that ""you'll be fine, it's not forever"". It sure as hell FEELS like it's going to last forever, though. I'm out of work again and I'm so so broke...

 I'm about to finish my degree and supposed to be starting out as a Corrections Officer, but I can't even BEGIN to consider that process until I get this fixed. How on earth am I supposed to pass a physicsl agility test and patrol for 12 hours straight when I can hardly get in a sitting position that isn't excruciating? How can I even think of saving up for an engagement ring when all I can think about is how much this hurts? I'm doing everything I'm being told to do--I've been religiously doing the PT exercises at home and in the facility, I don't drink, I'm constantly aware of my posture, I've even lost a substantial amount of weight in an effort to relieve pressure off of my disc. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. 

This stupid thing is honestly starting to put me in a dark place. I'm feeling so hopeless and depressed, like I'm not being taken seriously. Everywhere I've read, it's always ""give it a few weeks to a few months and it'll get better."" Nine months, though!? I don't feel like that's normal! All the doctors view it as ""oh yeah that's fine"", but they're not the ones who are hurting like this, either. I wish I could just bypass everything and get the surgery--especially after reading the countless testimonies of those who woke up from microdiscectomies and instantly felt pain relief. I'm trying to be strong and patient, but man, it's just so hard. My entire life is being put on hold, and it feels like the professionals have no real concern or sense of urgency to help me get to the point where I can START my life.

Anyways, anybody else's story, tips, or reassurance would be very greatly appreciated. I just need someone who can relate (though I wish NOBODY would have to relate to this).",3,1730783528.0,Sciatica,4,1.0,False

","*\[sharing from my personal blog:* [*https://spiralprogress.com/2024/11/04/why-shouldnt-you-give-money-to-homeless-people/*](https://spiralprogress.com/2024/11/04/why-shouldnt-you-give-money-to-homeless-people/) *\]*

Singer asks if you should save a drowning child. Obviously yes! And what if you were wearing a nice suit which could get ruined in the pond? Does not matter, you still have to jump in.  
  
And what if, on your way to work every morning, you pass by a homeless man who is cold, hungry and in need of help? What then?

Growing up, my dad gave me some version of this answer: They will just spend the money on drugs. He explained this to me in a nice way, as in ‚Äúit‚Äôs too bad, and we would like to help, but unfortunately‚Ä¶‚Äù

Even as a child this justification did not feel sufficient. Sometimes I would see homeless people who had families, or signs that explained that they had fallen on tough times, or who just appeared particularly sympathetic and not prone to drug abuse.

On one occasion, a homeless man asked my dad for money, and my dad offered him our boxed leftovers from the restaurant we were exiting. The homeless man gave a grunt and walked away. I did wonder if he had taken offense at being offered half-eaten food, but mostly I took this as evidence that my dad was right, and the homeless man was just asking for money to spend on drugs.

Still, I continued to feel that this could not always be the case. Surely there were at least some people we could help? Periodically I would stand at a corner, listen to a homeless musician who seemed genuinely talented and find myself wondering what he could do if given the right opportunity.

At a philosophical level, one resolution is to protest that while Singer is talking about saving a life, I am merely talking about the opportunity to momentarily defer discomfort. But the basic intuition still applies. For some trivial amount of money, I can provide a substantial benefit to another human being. In fact, were the cost of a meal to go missing from my bank account overnight, it‚Äôs likely I literally would not notice. How could there possibly not be an obligation here?

As I gold older, gained more independence and started walking around alone, I would occasionally take the initiative and offer a homeless man food unprovoked. I bought a man a meal from the McDonalds nearby that he seemed genuinely thankful for. On another occasion I bought a man a coffee, he pulled some cheese out of his pocket and added it to the paper cup. Sometimes, like my dad, I would get grunts.

Still, the results were encouraging enough that as a teenager, I had the great idea of asking everyone I knew for money, and then using it to feed the homeless at greater scale. Up until that point I had been relying on my meager allowance, and had always suspected that adults were far wealthier than they let on.

I spent some time online trying to learn about starting this kind of organization, and was shocked to learn that in fact, many well funded organizations dedicated to this exact mission already existed. The money I had hoped to raise paled in comparison to the budgets I saw online. I was confused and wanted answers.

At my next opportunity, I left home early and walked a few miles to the nearest soup kitchen. They weren‚Äôt taking volunteers that day, so I stood across the street just watching, somewhat incredulous that this service existed. Partially wowed by the generosity, and partially dismayed that the low hanging fruit I imagined did not exist, and that the openhanded giving of free food was not enough to resolve society‚Äôs ills.

I stopped trying to help the homeless for a few years after that. Once I was older, I started reading about the difficulties of running a shelter, why some homeless people choose to remain unsheltered, and the needs homeless people have beyond access to basic necessities. I looked for answers and found many.

When I walk past a homeless person now, I no longer think ‚Äúhe‚Äôll use the money to buy drugs‚Äù, but I also don‚Äôt think ‚ÄúI should do something to help‚Äù. Instead there is some complex explanation spanning local politics, mental health, economics and ethics that provides a rough conceptual framework, within which I can explain my lack of immediate obligations. A piece of that explanation is that the money won‚Äôt help long-term. Another is that my time and money is better spent elsewhere. But mostly this has become just a kind of automatic response that has gotten much less specific over time.

I built this explanation for myself in an explicit way. Most people don‚Äôt, and don‚Äôt have to. The pre-built narratives society provides are sufficient to suppress their human instinct to help others in need. Some of these narratives are cruel and rely on racist stereotypes or accusations of laziness. Others are sympathetic, even empathetic, but the upshot is the same.

I sometimes worry about the second order consequence of suppressing empathy this way. That regularly seeing someone in need and choosing not to help, has primed us for refusing aid in other situations where we have no real justification. But I also can‚Äôt endorse subjecting yourself to the mental load of thinking through, on each occasion, reasons you could do more but choose not to.

The type of lame shorthand explanations we offer our children in this scenario and so many others are not just a way of simplifying matters for young minds. They are a way of simplifying matters for ourselves. This is lazy, but also a necessary act born from the complexity of life and relative simplicity of our cognitive abilities.

In some ways, I do feel a sense of superiority. That I cared enough to think hard about this. But the sense is short lived. It doesn‚Äôt matter to the person suffering if my reasons are better thought out. I still do nothing. I still coddle myself with half-truths.

And I still have no idea what I‚Äôll tell my own children when the time comes",14,1730783153.0,slatestarcodex,3,1.0,False

Earlier this morning we were coming back from a party in my car and my boyfriend was speeding and absolutely plowed into cars parked on the street in front of a donut shop. My car is totaled and the other two cars probably are as well. The cops showed up in record time and while we were separated he told them it was me who was driving. The donut shop apparently had video and caught whole thing and they told him that the video seemed to show him driving but it wasn't clear so they would take his word for it. 

The cops then wrote me 3 tickets for speeding, losing control of a vehicle and wreck less driving. I was so in shock that I didn't even know what to say and I just signed the tickets. We got an uber home and got in a huge fight and I was just exasperated that he would do this to me. He reminded me that if he took credit for the accident , he would lose his job and his car insurance would be unaffordable so he couldn't get to work anyways. I said well my car is gone and my rates are going to sky rocket. He promised he would help me buy a new car and also help with my increased insurance rates. 

The accident was about 6 hours ago now and I still haven't called my insurance company to report the accident. Of course the other two people who had cars totaled probably have called, thus my insurance probably already thinks i caused the accident and are looking to destroy my rates going forward. 

I'm so angry, I have no idea what to even do. I don't want my BF to lose his job but I don't want to be screwed because he was driving like an asshole. I would love any advice.

**tl;dr:** boyfriend got in an accident and blamed it on me and thus I got three tickets and my car is totaled. He's promising to pay me back but I'm so livid I can hardly see strait.

‚Ä¢ When you are found to be committing insurance fraud, they will drop you and YOU will have a hard time getting insurance because YOUR name will go into a national database for fraudulent claims. Forget high rates, worry about being insurable whatsover. 

‚Ä¢ By lying to your insurance company and getting caught for fraud, they can¬†deny your entire claim. ALL OF IT.¬†Do you want to pay for your car, and two other cars? 

‚Ä¢ Lying to the police can cause you AND him to get charged with false report to the police.

And now he's sulking cos you won't have sex with him!? What?! 

>Honestly, he doesn't sound like he cares one iota about you. He sounds like a child- actually, a child would probably have more decency and empathy than this guy. You're over here, freaking out over what this means for your LIFE and whether you'll get arrested and whether you'll be able to afford to ever drive a car again, and he's being an ass, not consoling you, moaning over you not being in the mood, and listening to loud music?! AND he's made things worse for you and guilted you into taking the blame and committing fraud- like, if he wanted to keep his licence... Maybe he could have been a good driver instead of driving like a maniac repeatedly?! 

>Do yourself a favour, call a lawyer, go back to the police with them and set the record straight. You were woken up from sleep by a freaking car crash and were in shock; plus perhaps the video shows which side of the car your boyfriend exited from? Hang on in there.

**OOP Updated Aug 8, 2016/Same Post** 

Edit and update, sorry this is so long; 

So basically at the advice of this thread I stopped posting and called my mom and dad (who I really hadn't spoken to since I moved in with BF) and said I was leaving him, I was scared and begged to be picked up (this was about 1:30am). They said they would be over right away. I had locked myself in the bathroom and my BF must of heard me making the call because he started trying to beat the door down and I was terrified. When the door didn't go down easy I could hear him smashing things out in the living room of the apartment and kitchen. I stayed on the phone with my mom while my dad called 911 on his phone. I stayed locked in the bathroom and he occasionally would try to break the door down and again. All this time I was crying and so freaking scared and he was screaming and calling me every name in the book. We have neighbors with kids and I heard the kids wake up and start crying and then I'm pretty sure I heard one of the dads beating on our front door telling BF to shut up. 

Cops showed up just before my parents and immediately put him in hand cuffs and put him on the couch. And started taking statements from me and the neighbors. I came out of the bathroom and he looked like a raging, chained up psychopath. Everything, and I mean everything in our apartment is destroyed. Walls, plates, pictures, TV, xbox, ironing board, chairs...my clothes were thrown over the balcony, my make up was smashed against the wall and stuffed animals I was given as a baby were ripped apart. I have no idea how long it was but it was crazy he did so much damage in such a short period of time. 

My dad and my mom showed up and my mom started balling because she hadn't seen me in so long and my dad looked like he wanted to kill my BF but with the police there he composed himself really well. 

We had to stay during the time the police took everyone's statement. It was clear he was going to be arrested for a ton of stuff. I started telling them what caused all this and the story from earlier in the morning, so the officer asked me to get the tickets and it turns out the officer who wrote the tickets this morning is the guy from the night incidents direct supervisor. So they are going to talk today and if need be, maybe go back to the donut place and look at the footage. 

Then the worst thing of all happened, my mom was standing sort of by the door as they were taking BF out in handcuffs my mom gave him a really nasty look and he said something like ""if she goes home with you, you'll just have another who blows her brains out."" (my older brother committed suicide when he was 17 and I was 10--my mom has never gotten over it--neither have I really) and my mom reached out and slapped him as hard as she possibly could. So then the police had no choice but to arrest her as well. They were nice about it and loosely handcuffed her and took her to one of the squad cars. 

So I got dressed and tried to pack up and salvage whatever I could while my dad went down to bail out my mom. One of the three police stayed in the parking lot in his car just in case any of BFs boys showed up while I got what I could. 

My mom was in and out pretty quickly and is facing a misdemeanor battery charge which will probably go nowhere. But as you can imagine while my parents were very happy to get me, they were extremely pissed at what had transpired not only yesterday but the last six months or so. I have a very long road ahead to repair the relationship with them. 

My dad has been mostly silent but he did take me to the family attorney so he could start working on the stuff from the accident. He said it shouldn't be too hard to get me out of the tickets and women (especially) take the fall for husbands/boyfriends accidents way more often that you would think. I will probably still have to show up for court but by that time the investigation to show my BF was the one really driving should be concluded and I will be dismissed. 

However, the thing that REALLY sucks is that my state is a ""permissive use"" state meaning that my insurance has to cover anyone who is driving my car. There is a good chance that my insurance company will fight it out with his company for overall liability and it won't be as bad, but I'm still going to take a massive hit on car insurance premiums for a long time. 

Another good thing is the lease to the apartment is totally in his name so I won't be responsible for any damages there (plus I didn't do anything to put holes in walls) and I can just walk away from that.
This whole thing sucks so much because even after all that happened and as crazy as he was, I know I still have feelings for him that I need to get in serious therapy right away to start dealing with. I can't have someone so destructive in my life who was willing to let me take the fall for all his crap and then scared the life out of me and threatened me. 

tl;dr: on way to resolving issue of my BF wanting me to take the fall for his car accident yesterday. In the process he was arrested, destroyed the apartment and most of my things and then my mom was arrested for slapping him. I'm out, have talked to an attorney and its time to try and rebuild from here.

1gjymy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1gjymy3/how_to_keep_communication_happening/,How to keep communication happening ,"I am struggling with my ex. We have two kids and a cat together, so maintaining some form of communication is important. 

I feel unheard. I tried to make plans and he either doesn't confirm or does what he wants anyway. His reasons range from ""message doesn't make sense"" because I didn't fix an auto spell error, didn't read it because he didn't open the app/didn't get a notification, was at work or busy and he doesn't live on his phone (but would chat 4 h a night ""for work""  before we finally split) or has chosen not to talk to me because I was unreasonable / inappropriate/ whatever. 

It is usually three times I have to ask anything or call before I can expect a response, but that isn't petty, for the reasons given above. More than one thing at a time seems to break him, and he can maybe respond to some random detail, check spelling, and then not answer the question  anyway. He has said he hoped if it was hard enough to get back certain items that he gifted to me, I would give up. 

To clarify:

Unnecessary is asking him to message me himself when he is bringing the kids to my place to get something while I am away. Apparently our 8 year old can schedule the time around his work roster.  I can't even get him to meet me when things are at his place, let alone go there, and have had to buy so many items multiple times over because he won't respond. 

Unreasonable is inviting we meet at the police station because I'm pretty sure he once watched me walk around the car park looking for him, waited until I called, only to discover he'd pointed out my car parked one  row from him. Sure he made it across the car park in less than the 20 minutes it had taken me from the airport, where we hadn't met because ""he hadn't seem the message"" sent a week before, but that's not ""crazy stalker vibes"" from him, just crazy from me. Not like he ever said he'd sit in front of a girls' school to watch me drop them off because they were with me that day. 

Inappropriate is telling him that if he can't find his way to the hospital halfway between the two schools, when I have given the street names, I can't help him. Or asking where hes gone when I have driven across town to pick him up, only to have him walk back inside when he sees us arrive. 

Over-reacting is being upset when the au pair who had come away with me ignored my daughter when she was sick while I was at work. She stayed in her room two nights, while a 7 yo called me at 1 am because her sister had been crying kn the bathroom for almost an hour. Said she heard me coming and going, all three times, but didn't come out. He ""investigated"" my concerns, never responded to me directly, but told my oldest that people ""over-react"". And I'm left to wonder why my oldest begs me not to get a baby sitter. 

I admit I get mad,  and this is also unreasonable. He has quite happily told me the reason he didn't talk to me for 3 weeks (while getting up to physically block me from group conversations while i was at home) was because ""dishes weren't done"" in front of his father. Despite the fact I'd just sat down to have coffee with his Dad (who didn't notice we were fighting ) before cleaning up after baking for a party of 30 kids, when he walked through the door, because he'd complained that I didn't pay attention to his family. A year later, he agreed that was ridiculous, but the reason given was ""you hadn't done the thing"". 

I am having to accept that the marriage breakdown was my fault. I'd admitted to cheating, when I said I'd ended up being held down on a so-called friend's bed during lock down. I wasn't looking after his ""needs"" because I was away working 3 weeks at a time, at his suggestion, to avoid those unproductive travel days. 

I am apparently unreasonably angry all the time, and the guy with a psychology degree and focus on trauma can't connect the dots. I can't call his GF a creep or perv for making jokes about grabbing people against their will because ""it's what I do"", and calling that assault is just a ""nasty accusation "". I just don't get their jokes. 

I can't deal with him. I've   had to change my doctor, get a new post office box, hairdresser, etx to avoid them. Any attempt in communication takes days to recover from, let alone meeting him face to face. 

I want some way to mediate, because the app that Family Counselling  doesn't work. I would like to think that he might behave for a third party, but I can't count on it. 

He ignored my lawyer's letter for a year, but now wants it done ASAP. I can't afford a lawyer for this stupid back and forth. 

I can't ask a mutual friend, because he has already complained about me turning popular against him, because I vented after he took his GF to his first school event in 6 years (didn't introduce her, they thought she was new sitter), and they hadn't known we'd separated because I didn't want to admit I was bssically homeless while he went about as if nothing had happened. He has said if I do that, he ""will take measures"" to protect our daughters from that.

His family made lip service ""you're still a part of our life"" but didn't call me when he was stranded 4 days with car trouble and didn't get to visit them knew holidays. Plus, his dad... 

I don't have family to speak of, and certainly none who I can count on. My sisters looked after each other, and we are basically NC.

Started feeling a bit yucky on Tuesday 10/29; minor stuff, thought it might be a cold coming on, not too worried. Wednesday morning woke up and felt like, oh yeah, I am definitely sick. Masked up and went into work because nobody could/would cover me. Got through work (am a barista) with DayQuil and ibuprofen. Started to have a persistent headache towards the end of my shift/evening. Got home after my shift, tested, and had a faint positive. Took two more tests to be sure. Mind you, I‚Äôve tested MANY time and never had a positive, so was thoroughly flabbergasted. 

Thursday was the worst of the symptoms I‚Äôd say, just super intense exhaustion - still dragged myself out of the house to make a short store run and felt like crap the whole time. Also has just felt like a more intense cold maybe, more tiredness/fatigue. Friday was easier than Thursday, Saturday was about the same. Saturday night I realized my sense of taste was going. Sunday morning realized had almost completely lost my taste and smell. Huge bummer. Feels like a type of blindness. I can smell coffee if it‚Äôs right up in my nose, like if I put my nose in the bag, and still get the salty/sweet/spicy sensations as far as taste goes. The coffee smell/taste is most important to me, the rest sucks but hoping it comes back soon. Today was the first day I woke up and was like, oh, I think I‚Äôm feeling a bit better/I have more energy, how nice! I‚Äôve been going for short walks almost every day, getting sun when I can. I‚Äôve enlisted my partner to get groceries for me when I need them. I‚Äôve been taking DayQuil, an electrolyte/vitamin powder (idk man), magnesium biglycinate at night. 

Funnily enough, one of my coworkers that I worked with 3 days in a row (the prior Sat/Sun/Mon) missed work Tuesday (the day I started to feel sick) because she felt unwell. Her girlfriend was also sick. I happened to run into her girlfriend the prior Friday and Saturday night. I know this is convoluted. I tested positive Wednesday; they didn‚Äôt test positive until Thursday/Friday despite showing symptoms before me. Ain‚Äôt that just the way. Two of my friends I saw Tuesday also got covid, started showing symptoms a couple of days after seeing me. My partner I also saw Tuesday, however, so far (knock on wood) hasn‚Äôt tested positive or gotten super sick. He got covid in May and despite me spending every day with him while he was sick, I never showed symptoms or tested positive. Thoroughly convinced me I was just one of the lucky few. 

Anyways, I just find this all fascinating. It really feels like random chance/russian roulette sometimes. How did my friend I shared cups with on Tuesday and my partner I swapped spit with not catch it (fingers crossed it stays that way) but two friends I only hugged have it? Who gave it to who? Whomst is to say? 

For the fellow curious, I‚Äôve been taking pictures of my covid tests (I am a woman of science after all) and it is absolutely wild to me. My first positive tests were faint, took some time to show on Wednesday 10/30. Saturday, I tested again, immediate strong positive line. Today tested again and it took some time and was arguably fainter than Wednesday. Exciting! Still feeling some head cold-type symptoms, but this reminds me of getting a cold and then when you know you‚Äôre getting better but still feel mildly shitty and are just getting crap out of your lungs/body. Here‚Äôs hoping my smell and taste return soon. ",5,1730780533.0,COVID19positive,4,0.86,False
