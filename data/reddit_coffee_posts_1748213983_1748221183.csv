I am in the beginning of the research process to start a baked goods business that would primarily operate at farmers markets, vendor events, and maybe even by individual order. These would be simple items: coffee cakes, banana breads, cookies, tarts, etc., with limited cheese, custard, egg, and dairy. Additionally, this would be a single person operation, if that is important to know.

The most confusing thing so far has been determining the needed licenses for this to operate legally. Currently, I am planning to rent out up to code kitchens to do the food handling and packaging in, and selling out of permit holding festivals, markets, etc. Beyond this, what kind of certs and licenses are needed? I have my food handler cert, but do I need to register a business or sole proprietorship? Are there permits I need as an individual? The resources online are not very clear on this or any specifics.

Any insight someone may have on this would be great. What is the most efficient way to approach this?

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress - it strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way, while not being totally lost to them.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is inscribed onto one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations and thoughts. I also adore writing conversationally, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography is also something I dabble in, although not as much as I'd like. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, and coffee.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelg√§ngers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with. A person who understands that no one will ever be your clone and dares to take exuberant advantage of that fact seems required for the deepest sorts of bonds.** ¬†I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably detailed chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention; anything dazzling will also do.

She‚Äôs never been the spotlight type. She doesn‚Äôt dress for red carpets, doesn‚Äôt post curated stories, and doesn‚Äôt belong in the glossy world of headlines and flashing cameras. She‚Äôs the girl behind the scenes‚Äîthe one who brings him coffee when he‚Äôs locked in the studio for 18 hours, the one who slips love notes into his bags before he flies across the world, the one who stays silent when the tabloids pair him with someone else again. She‚Äôs known him long before the world did, before the fame and the tours and the ego. And somewhere along the way, she fell in love with him, not the celebrity, but the boy he used to be when no one else was watching.

But somewhere along the way, she became invisible.

The story begins on her birthday, just a regular Tuesday to him. She doesn‚Äôt expect much, never has. Just a few hours. Maybe a walk. Maybe a movie night on the couch like they used to do before his phone never stopped buzzing. She doesn‚Äôt say it outright. She never demands. She just smiles, soft-spoken as ever, and suggests, ‚ÄúMaybe when you're done at the studio‚Ä¶ we could just do something. Anything, really.‚Äù But he brushes her off, distracted, already halfway out the door.

She doesn‚Äôt cry. Not right away. She just sits in the quiet, one hand pressed over her belly‚Äîa new secret, just barely beginning to show. A life growing inside her. His child. And yet she wonders if he‚Äôll even notice when she‚Äôs gone. Because she‚Äôs not angry. Just tired. Tired of being a second thought in a life she never asked to compete with. Tired of giving everything and receiving almost nothing in return.

\----

I‚Äôm looking for someone to write the role of the celebrity in this emotional, gut-wrenching, slow-burn story about love, neglect, and the quiet kind of heartbreak that comes from being forgotten. Your character could be a musician, actor, influencer or whatever feels right. The key is that he‚Äôs lost in his world, unaware of how much he‚Äôs hurting the only person who‚Äôs never wanted anything from him but love.

This story will be driven by vulnerability, emotional tension, slow-burn revelations, and the haunting ache of unspoken truths.

He was 31 when we met and his mom called him every hour, and was still on his bank. She would threaten welfare checks if he didn't answer the phone. His counselor advised no contact, with his family which he constantly broke, making both of us unsafe. I finally had enough after he made a false report and had the cops at the door of our apartment the day I decided to pack and leave. I tried for too long to be understanding of his trauma and how his behaviors were rooted in trauma, but at some point there just wasn't an excuse. It was an awful relationship. It has been an entire year, I am finally feeling somewhat comfortable again. I have been in counseling twice a week and have DV advocate that was assigned to me due to the fact he would block doorways, threaten to kick me out and file false reports when I would try to leave him. The relationship taught me a lot about myself. We live in a very rural area and he works for a company that is closing its doors, it is a small town and one of the only major employers in the area. It is also limited on shopping options and you have to come to the county I am in now at least once a month to stock up on things you cannot get in the county he is in. The county I live in has a lot more job prospects. Each time he had an interview, he would try to stop at my house, or at my studio even though I had made it clear I didn't want to talk to him unless it was about the money he owed me for the lease he skipped out on. To his credit, he has paid me back diligently, but I made it clear I didn't want this to be used as an opening to have unnecessary contact. Last week he sent me flowers, and a very long letter (3 pages) basically explaining how sorry he was, how this time away from me has made him realize he was the issue, how sorry he was for allowing his family to treat me this way etc. The last line: ""WHEN I come back things will be different and I am taking steps to remove my family from my life for your safety."" I resealed the envelope, marked return to sender and let my mailman know to reject any mail from that address. He texted me and asked if I received the letter. I let him know I had but it was inappropriate and I don't want him to send me anything further. We are done and there is no reconciling. as I would never be able to feel safe with him again. Boundaries were never his strong suit. He has been ""running in"" to me (Even though he lives 90 minutes away.) I have a small business and vend festivals in the summer, and he has attended 4 of the 6 I have vended, one of which was 4 hours from him. He purchased something from my stand. I have made it clear I am grateful for his patronage, but don't want to see him again. I did reach out to the police, and they basically said that unless he is coming to my door repeatedly threes really nothing they can do. Things came to a head last week when I was on the first date I have been on in since we broke up. I met a guy through a friend, and he took me out to lunch at my usual Sunday spot. This was the first time I felt comfortable going since going there with my ex. I was having a great time, and ordered a honey latte, and as our coffee came I saw a car that looked like my ex's pull up. I brushed it off, and thought it was silly because there no way he would show up on a random Sunday. Well I was wrong. In walked my ex. I made my new date aware, and to his credit he asked if I wanted to get the coffees to go and immediately offered to take me somewhere else. I said ""No. I need to live my life. He will not ruin this for me."" My date, we will call him Ben, got up and let the waitress know and she sat him far away from us. My ex repeatedly asked for the table next to us and she told him it was reserved. Thankfully the restaurant was very busy, so he couldn't really overhear our conversation. It was so awkward he constantly looked back at me. We finished our lunch and opted for a nice walk in the park, my ex followed us there. We ended up losing him in the nature loop and quickly ditching him at the park. I told him later that night if he continued this, I would file against him for harassment., and stalking. He apologized and said ""It wasn't his intent"" and he ""Just missed me and was worried about me because \[he\] left me in such a bad spot."" I told him my boundaries were clear, and that if he continued this it would become a legal matter. I thought that would work. Nope. My grandparents own a cemetery and we have a big memorial day event every year to honor the veterans who have served. It is open to the public. This man had the audacity to show up, and not only that but stood by my dads grave. My grandfather let him know he was no longer welcome and he should not come back. I feel hopeless and just want to move on with my life. I have contacted a lawyer and they said the only thing I can do is send him a cease and desist and put the payments in escrow through the court. On the upside he has stopped texting me, because at the very least the police told him to stop that. but that won't stop him from being creepy and awkward in person,",1,1748220258.0,ToxicRelationships,0,0.99,False

Doesn't it weaken the case?,"I've made some mistakes related to theft. Previously, I had never been charged with a crime or even questioned by police. The Crown has generously offered diversion with a Direct Accountability program. I've been accepted into this program and it's going extremely well. Plus, I was fortunate because the police detective who arrested me told me that he understood that I just made some mistakes and am basically a good person. I'm in my 50's but look much younger.

My questions are related to ""evidence"" in my Disclosure. There's a 60-minute video police statement accusing me of being an agent of an ethnoreligious group that's supposedly evil and operates an evil organization. 

Apparently, a man walked into a police station and made a complaint about me. This man believes that the Jewish community is after him and wants to ruin his life. He's convinced that the Jewish community is highly organized and hires people (of different ethnic and religious backgrounds) to spy on him. 

This man is convinced that this supposed Jewish Organization has placed GPS trackers in his truck; installed cameras in his house; steals his mail (though he confessed to taking his neighbour's mail); and wants to ruin his life. Motive? Because almost two years ago, he had a disagreement with a neighbour who happened to be Jewish. 

The man is so paranoid that he sneaks into his own house, so the Jewish Organization won't see him enter his own house! This man lives near a park and is continuously reporting people to police. People who walk their dogs near his house are supposedly agents of the Jewish Organization and spying on him. Same with people waiting near the park to pick up their children. 

So this man saw me in the neighborhood and became convinced that I work for the Jewish Organization (since the supposed Jewish Organization hires people of all ethnic and religious backgrounds). This man followed me to a coffee shop, photographed my vehicle, and photographed me driving. I was unaware that I was being followed and photographed.

My questions are: 1) Why would this 60-minute video statement to police be included in the Disclosure? Why not just include the 60-second part that he believes that I did something suspicious? Are the police not supposed to edit police statements, so must include the entire rant about the supposed Jewish Organization supposedly ruining his life?
2) Doesn't this ""evidence"" weaken the police case against me? Every week, the man is reporting people walking their dogs; waiting in their cars; and so on... as supposed agents of the supposed Jewish Organization. 3) Would this garbage be allowed in a trial? Would the Defense WANT to include the ""evidence"" in the trial because it would weaken the police case against me? The man admitted to taking his neighbour's mail and admitted that his employee almost died in a workplace accident...AND he's complaining about me supposedly doing something suspicious????

I'm grateful that the Crown generously offered me diversion with a Direct Accountability program. I'm grateful to the police detective who arrested me saying that he believes I am a good person who just made some mistakes. However, I can't understand WHY the Disclosure included this 60-minute video police statement filled with paranoid delusions of a Jewish Organization supposedly hiring people (including myself) to ruin his life.... Why not just include the part where the witness claims that I did something suspicious?

1kvh3k8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Subliminal/comments/1kvh3k8/how_i_manifested_an_sp/,How I manifested an SP,"Hi guys
I want to share a success story! 

In October, two years ago, I was approached by the man I will be referring to throughout the post, he was over twice my age but I like older men so I did not mind, he asked for my number and I gave it‚Ä¶ we met twice but not on a date, just to get to know each other, I was always unsure of what he wanted from me, he spoke about wanting a connection but because he was so much older I believed he really only wanted to be physical. I think he believed me to be too immature or not the right person for him and he would send me some long paragraphs saying that I am too young for him, we can be friends and nothing more, that‚Äôs his final decision. 
I respected it, however, I always thought about him even until recently, we would see each other in the gym but extremely rarely, maybe a few times last year and he would always flirt with me, touch my hair and give me false hope, I acted upon it once but he again made it clear that he was not flirting and only wanted a friendly connection, after that message I stopped texting him , but again, I would think about him daily, not obsessively but as a passing thought. 


Then, in March, he came to the gym and we had not seen each other for half a year or so, he talked to me for an hour and I asked him why he had told me to delete his number, he grabbed my phone and rewrote his number, but I did not text him. Instead, I made a subliminal where I wrote things such as ‚Äúhe texted me, he called me, he always sees me in the gym, we met and we are together‚Äù and so forth. I would listen to this randomly and told my friend I‚Äôd be manifesting him as a project, to see if it would work. 


Three weeks later, I entered the gym and saw him, I began to get nervous and tremble a little, he came over to me and I think the way I was responding and acting bubbly and friendly made him invite me for coffee. 


Now, I can say that he is extremely close to me, we‚Äôve been seeing each other ever since that day and he even buys me expensive things, sends me long paragraphs that he writes about me on a website that he shares with others, poetic pieces about me, he drives me around, he puts in an effort to see me and he told me he is addicted to me. The scenes I visualizes are now all an actual reality for me. I would always visualize that he‚Äôd approach me in the gym, pull my hair or hug me or whatever, and now we literally work out together, I was doing a pull up on the bar and he came behind me, grabbed my waist and began lifting me up and down. He always invites me, calls me, he‚Äôs the one texting me, I always stayed calm and he is the one chasing me now. 

In short, I spent over a year desiring him and nothing happened, however, when I began making a subliminal and manifesting that he actually contacted me and we met, then it happened so quickly after and now he‚Äôs all over me!!!

You love Susan. Susan‚Äôs great. But you didn‚Äôt move to Sicily for polite conversations over PG Tips.

Making local friends isn‚Äôt impossible ‚Äî but it takes some cultural navigation, a dose of humility, and a healthy sense of humor.

# Let‚Äôs break it down.

# 1. Understand That Sicilian Friendships Are Earned, Not Given

You might be used to spontaneous coffee dates and ‚Äúlet‚Äôs grab a drink!‚Äù culture. In Sicily, things move differently. Friendships often come from long-standing ties: family, school, military service, football clubs. It‚Äôs a tightly woven fabric.

But that doesn‚Äôt mean there isn‚Äôt room for you. It just means you‚Äôll need to hang around a little longer, show genuine interest, and prove you‚Äôre not just a passing tourist with a fantasy of sun-drenched simplicity.

Consistency is key. The more you show up, the more doors open ‚Äî slowly, but sincerely.

The comments are truly appreciated, but they‚Äôre not anticipated, lol. I‚Äôve gotten a decent amount of messages because I post here, but, wow: scammers and such lonely men.

So, doing my best to be that single Jenga block that does more than it does less.

- I recently posted my SA profile for review, and it wasn‚Äôt well received. After combining the experiences I‚Äôve had with SDs who are genuinely attracted to me, plus the latest messages, I‚Äôll say that it doesn‚Äôt matter what I wear. A potential SD likes my face, my body, and my honest personality- unless they‚Äôre a scam, then they like anything.

- Generosity is earned, in any percentage, so please don‚Äôt drop intimacy on a SD, or‚Ä¶ goodness forbid‚Ä¶ be the SD/SB who went too far, too fast.

- M&Gs are not work. Please focus on that information. If you prefer a paid date, tell him; if not, be sure to meet somewhere you‚Äôll naturally enjoy yourself, because some potential SDs will lowball you, every single time, from coffee to dinner.

I kind of don‚Äôt care about the comments, tonight? This is because I‚Äôm speaking from true experience. You need to keep in mind as an SB, that you‚Äôre communicating with a real person. And we all know, through regular dating, that sometimes that person is perfect for us, or sometimes they make zero sense to us.

I've had a Breville Barista Express for about 4 years now. I managed to get my coffee dialled in perfectly and it was better then any cafe around ‚ù§Ô∏è. I moved recently and the coffee roaster that has amazing beans (and used to be 5 mins down the road)  increased their price significantly and doesn't offer free postage, so my beans got really expensive and I decided maybe it was time to find another roast. I bought two bags from a different roaster and spent nearly the entire first 500g bag trying to dial in, with no luck. 

My previous roast was dark, I had an internal bur setting of 3 and a grind setting of 6. I don't remember exactly the ratios but I'd say I did a 1:3 pull with ~19.5g of beans and close to 60g out. It seemed to take a while but I dialled it in ages ago and never worried about timing as the shots were beautiful. 

Now, I still have a dark roast on the new beans and I ended up needing to adjust my internal burs down to a 2 because the shots were running too fast. I've experimented with grind settings from 7 all the way down to 2 on the new bur setting but it seems to pull a shot set at a 1:2 ratio in about 14 seconds. Sometimes as fast as 10s (not including pre-infusion time of about 7-8 seconds) and never  longer than 20seconds including pre-infusion.No matter how fine I go it doesn't slow down.  

I dose 18-19g into a dosing cup, and use a distributor, then a puck screen. My pressure is always okay if not going a bit high, but it is coming out way too fast.   I've tried going with a bigger yield, ( I take it up as far as 1:3) and it's better but still not nice. And going down in grind size sometimes actually makes it come out faster. Is that channeling? 

I use the stock Breville portafilter (non-pressurised), filtered water, and I don't like black espresso so it's hard for me to taste, and had always tasted bitter to me,  but I do notice that it can be very astringent and sour... my mouth feels funny after testing the shot by itself. 

I think these beans suck, maybe they're too old? I noticed they didn't have a date stamp on the bags after I got them home and started having terrible troubles. I'll be trying another roaster but I don't want to face the same trouble on the next bean. I know I should be able to dial it in quickly, so this is nuts to me.   Does my machine need a service? Any advice? 

I had a cafe coffee the other day for the first time in ages and was blown away at his crappy my home shots have become. ",1,1748218227.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Behind me, footsteps crunched through the yard.

‚ÄúMelanie?‚Äù Ewing‚Äôs voice soft, careful. Like he‚Äôs approaching something wounded. Something that might bolt if he moved too fast.

I wiped my mouth with the back of my hand, still shaking.

‚ÄúI‚ÄîI talked to Rivas‚Äô wife. She made those scarves for sure. The red ones. She said she made one for your wife and one for her cousin, years ago. But she hasn‚Äôt seen her in forever.‚Äù

He frowned. I watch his brow crease like he was pretending to solve a puzzle he already knows the answer to. ‚ÄúYou think her cousin might‚Äôve been one of Sam‚Äôs victims?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt answer right away. Just stared at him. ‚ÄúIt feels like it.‚Äù

A long silence stretched between us.

‚ÄúLook,‚Äù he said gently, ‚ÄúThat is a huge stretch but we can definitely look into it. But for now, maybe you should go inside. Take a minute. Grab some of your parents‚Äô things. Say goodbye to the house. You might not come back here again for a while.‚Äù

I nodded, but it‚Äôs more reflex than agreement. I moved back toward the house, hands barely aware of what they were touching my mother‚Äôs blanket, a photo from the kitchen wall, the little carved bird my dad kept on the mantle. I‚Äôm halfway to the front door when I heard it.

A noise. Soft. But there.

Rummaging.

It was coming from the office.

I moved slowly toward the door and pushed it open.

Ewing. Half-crouched at my father‚Äôs filing cabinet, slipping something into his coat pocket. Papers. Photos.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù I asked. My voice came out sharper than I expected.

He froze just for a second then stood up, easy and casual, like he‚Äôs been caught with his hand in a cookie jar. 

‚ÄúOh uh, this looked kind of interesting. I was gonna show it to you in the car. Just didn‚Äôt seem like the time while you were saying goodbye.‚Äù

I stared at him but I didn‚Äôt  push it. ‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶‚Äù

I came out carrying bags stuffed full of things. I didn‚Äôt stop to think about how I‚Äôd cram all this into my suitcase I just grabbed everything that felt important, like I was trying to hold onto pieces of my life before they slipped away. I hadn‚Äôt realized how much all this stuff meant to me until now.

Ewing stepped forward and took a few bags from my hands, easing them into the trunk of the car.

I whispered a quiet, ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

He closed the trunk with a soft click and gave me a small, understanding nod.

I buckled in and stared at him with impatience. 

I waited and watched.

Finally, I say, ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ are you gonna show me what you took?‚Äù

He glances over at me. His face was unreadable.

‚ÄúWhat stuff?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe stuff from the office.‚Äù

There‚Äôs a pause. A beat too long.

‚ÄúOh. Right.‚Äù He reached into his coat and pulled out a handful of envelopes and some photos.

I took them slowly.


The photos were of me but the letters were addressed to my parents.

Not from recently, but not that long ago either. All of them were clearly taken without me knowing. One‚Äôs from Yosemite my back turned, kneeling in the grass with my tripod. Another from Glacier, right before I left. Then Denali. The edge of the lake. My exact frame, just‚Ä¶ from further back.


They were definitely photographed by the same person that took the photos I found at the bunker. I‚Äôm 100% sure of that. They just got better. Way better. 


The letters were just as scary. Disjointed. Rambling. Some read like admiration, but most feel like something else entirely. An obsession that had no outlet.

He wrote about my ‚Äúeye for light.‚Äù The ‚Äúwildness‚Äù in my face. One line appears more than once, always in shaky, rushed handwriting:

I want to meet her. When can I meet her? 

My skin prickled.

‚ÄúThis is sam,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúWhy was he writing to my parents? They knew someone was following me. Why wouldn‚Äôt they tell me? Why wouldn‚Äôt they warn me?‚Äù

Ewing reached out and tried to take the papers from my hand gently but I pulled them closer to me. They felt more important to me at the moment than anything else I just took out of that house. 

‚ÄúMelanie‚Ä¶ this could be from anyone. Some kid, obsessed with your work. You‚Äôre public-facing. These things happen.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù My voice was firm now. ‚ÄúThese are personal. Look at the wording. He was taunting them. You don‚Äôt send this to strangers. He wanted them to be scared.‚Äù

He shrugged. ‚ÄúTry not to spiral. We‚Äôll take it to the local station tomorrow. You can talk to the deputies about your parents‚Äô case. About everything.‚Äù

I stared at him. ‚ÄúDo you have an evidence bag?‚Äù

He patted his coat. ‚ÄúNo. But they‚Äôll have some at the station.‚Äù

I nodded. Slowly.

Outside, the sun slipped behind the trees and the car began to move.

I didn‚Äôt speak for a long time.

The road stretched out ahead, flat and sun-bleached, like it had no end. Trees flickered past the windows in fast blurs of green and shadow. Everything was quiet. Even the engine‚Äôs hum seemed like it was holding its breath.

The stack of photos sat in my lap. I ran my fingers over the edges, hoping they‚Äôd tell me something the images wouldn‚Äôt. But my thoughts buzzed like flies fast, frantic, never landing.

I flipped one of the photos over.

Nothing. No date. No scribbled note. Just a photo of me, caught mid crouch by a streambed, camera to my eye. I was almost hidden in the frame, but it was me. I remembered that day the fog, the cold, the way the water stung my skin.

I remembered thinking I was alone.

But I guess I wasn‚Äôt.

And maybe I never had been. 

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù Ewing asked, his eyes on the road.

I looked at him. One hand on the wheel, the other resting easy on his thigh. His face was calm professional. Always the same. Measured. Like someone who practiced being human until it finally stuck.

‚ÄúI had this memory earlier,‚Äù I said quietly. ‚ÄúSomething I haven‚Äôt thought about in years.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt answer. Just waited.

‚ÄúI was in high school. Fifteen, maybe. I used to walk home every day same time, same route. And for a while‚Ä¶ I thought someone was following me. I never saw them. I just felt it. The hair on the back of my neck would stand up. I‚Äôd hear leaves crunch behind me, or footsteps, just out of rhythm with mine.‚Äù

I turned to the window, watching the trees blur by.

‚ÄúI told myself it was nothing. Some boy from school. Maybe someone with a crush. Harmless.‚Äù

Ewing gave a small nod, but didn‚Äôt say a word.

‚ÄúBut now I‚Äôm wondering what if it wasn‚Äôt harmless?  What if this has been happening longer than I thought? Not just Alaska. Not just the past few years. What if Sam‚Äôs been watching me since I was a kid?‚Äù

He let out a slow breath through his nose. ‚ÄúThat kind of thinking doesn‚Äôt help.‚Äù

I shrugged In resilience. ‚ÄúIt might be the only thing that makes sense.‚Äù

He glanced at me, lips pressed into a line. ‚ÄúYou said yourself you never saw anyone.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt mean no one was there.‚Äù I snapped.

Ewing lifted his hands on the steering wheel in defeat. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt mean it was Sam either.‚Äù 

Silence settled over us again, though, it was way heavier this time. 

The police station looked like a dentist office who‚Äôd long since gone out of business.

Even from the car, I could tell something felt‚Ä¶ wrong. It sat at the edge of town like an afterthought, a squat brick building with weather-faded letters across the front that read POLICE DEPARTMENT, the ‚ÄúM‚Äù missing entirely, as if even the sign had given up.

A single streetlamp buzzed overhead, casting a cone of flickering orange light onto the pavement. One lone cruiser was parked out front, its windshield caked in pollen and wipers stuck in place like they hadn‚Äôt been used in days.

Ewing pulled into the lot without a word. The tires crunched over gravel as he parked beside the cruiser, cutting the engine. For a second, we just sat there in the silence. No movement in the windows. No sign of life inside.

This was supposed to be a police station. A place of answers. Safety.

It looked like a tomb.

He finally stepped out, boots hitting the ground with a heavy thud. I followed, tucking my sleeves tighter around my wrist, heart pounding as I stared up at the lifeless building. A weak light glowed behind smoky glass. Everything else was still.

And then we stepped inside.

Fluorescent ceiling panels hummed overhead, the light flickering slightly in one corner like it hadn‚Äôt been fixed in years. Beige walls were smudged near the baseboards, and the front counter made of some laminate wood that was probably trendy in the ‚Äô80s was cluttered with cold coffee cups, a chipped ceramic mug full of pens, and two half eaten granola bars, still in their wrappers.

Three officers sat behind it, each in their own little bubble of boredom. One leaned so far back in his chair he looked like he might tip over, a paperback mystery novel balanced open on his chest. The second tapped lethargically at a keyboard, scrolling without urgency through a spreadsheet that looked more like busywork than evidence. The third, a tired looking woman with bags under her eyes, was nursing a large travel mug and staring blankly at the wall like her brain had long since checked out.

I stopped just inside the doorway, staring at them in disbelief. My anger steamed in the air trailing in behind me, but none of the officers even glanced up.

‚ÄúThis is it?‚Äù I asked. My voice rang out across the room. ‚ÄúThis is the team working on my parents‚Äô murder?‚Äù

Still, no one moved.

Behind me, Officer Ewing stepped inside, brushing off his shoulders like he was walking into his own living room. 

‚ÄúThis is the department,‚Äù he said evenly. ‚ÄúCrime‚Äôs low here. Has been for years.‚Äù

I turned on him, eyes flashing. ‚ÄúLow crime doesn‚Äôt mean no crime. My parents were killed. Murdered in their own home, and you‚Äôve got a guy reading Nancy Drew and a woman staring into space like she‚Äôs on break from a factory line.‚Äù

The woman finally stirred, lifting her mug in a limp sort of toast. ‚ÄúEvenin.‚Äù

I stared in disbelief. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to be kidding me.‚Äù

Ewing exhaled through his nose, like a teacher trying not to lose his patience with a difficult student. ‚ÄúLook, I get it. You‚Äôre upset. But this isn‚Äôt a city. They don‚Äôt have full units for homicide or cold cases or whatever Netflix tells people they should expect from a small-town PD. It‚Äôs the same back in Alaska.‚Äù

I stepped forward, my boots thudding hard against the old tile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not asking for a task force. I‚Äôm asking if any of you even tried.‚Äù

That got their attention. The man with the book closed it slowly and sat up, his expression unreadable.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been trying,‚Äù he said, his tone flat. ‚ÄúSince day one. But we‚Äôve hit a dead end.‚Äù

‚ÄúA dead end?‚Äù I repeated, the words sour in my mouth. ‚ÄúWhat does that even mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo forced entry. No prints. No DNA. No witnesses. The place was clean. Like‚Ä¶ professionally clean.‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúSo what, you just gave up?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course not,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still looking into it, but‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou missed this,‚Äù I snapped, reaching into my pockets. I yanked out the envelope, tearing it open and scattering its contents photos, letters, handwritten pages across the station floor like a broken deck of cards. They fluttered down onto the tile in slow, dramatic spirals, curling at the edges as they landed.

‚ÄúThere,‚Äù I said, voice shaking. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs that for evidence? These were in their house. In their things. And somehow, you missed them.‚Äù

The officers stared down at the mess, unmoving.

The man at the computer finally spoke. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôd you get those?‚Äù

‚ÄúFrom their HOUSE. You know, the crime scene you apparently forgot how to search.‚Äù

Ewing crouched down, gathering the photos with a deliberate calm that made me want to scream. 

‚ÄúNo one‚Äôs forgotten anything,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut you need to cool off.‚Äù

I stepped back, nostrils flaring. ‚ÄúCool off?‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù he said, standing. ‚ÄúConference room‚Äôs open. Just for a few minutes, alright? Let me talk to them.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to sit down.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù he said, voice gentler now. ‚ÄúBut let me explain to them what you found. I‚Äôve been in touch with them for a while. Months. I know them. Let me bring them up to speed just the big stuff and then we‚Äôll see if we want to keep going tonight or wait until morning.‚Äù

I glanced toward the officers. None of them met my eyes. The woman was sipping her coffee again. The man with the book had opened it back to his page. They weren‚Äôt just uninterested. They were checked out. Like my parents‚Äô deaths were just another item on a long, dusty list.

Something inside me buckled.

Without a word, I turned and walked toward the hallway, my boots echoing dully against the linoleum. The conference room door creaked as I pushed it open, and the moment it shut behind me, the silence was deafening. I stood still for a long second, my chest rising and falling, fingers curled into fists.

Something felt wrong. So wrong.

And it wasn‚Äôt just the officers.

It was him.

Ewing‚Äôs voice drifted from behind the closed door, calm and muffled.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been talking to her for a while now. She‚Äôs just scared. We‚Äôll keep her busy through the night. Don‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôll handle it.‚Äù

I backed away from the door.

I didn‚Äôt feel any safer.

The room was small, with thin gray carpet and a single rectangular table at the center. The overhead light cast a sickly yellow glow that made everything look jaundiced‚Ä¶my skin, the walls, the surface of the table, which was marred with old coffee rings and faint scratches from years of disuse.

There were chairs pushed haphazardly around it, some mismatched, like they‚Äôd been dragged in from other rooms over time. A dry erase board on the far wall had the remnants of a list someone had half heartedly erased. I could still make out the ghost of the word ‚ÄúSHIFT‚Äù and a few names beneath it, smudged and forgotten.

I didn‚Äôt sit. I couldn‚Äôt.

Instead, I paced. Slowly. One step at a time. My fingertips grazed the back of one chair, then another. The silence pressed in like insulation. Too quiet. Like the room was holding its breath.

Outside the door, I could hear muffled voices Ewing‚Äôs mostly. Calm, low. The occasional short reply from one of the officers. Nothing urgent. Nothing that sounded like people reacting to new evidence.

He said he was ‚Äúbringing them up to speed.‚Äù But something about the way he said it earlier‚Ä¶

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been talking to them for a while now.‚Äù

How long was ‚Äúa while‚Äù?
Why hadn‚Äôt anyone called me?

I crossed to the wall and rested my hands on the table, leaning over it. That‚Äôs when I noticed the security camera in the corner. A tiny, black dome probably not even on. But I turned away from it anyway. Instinct.

I hated this place.

I could still see their faces those three officers. Dead eyed. Bored. As if my parents hadn‚Äôt been butchered in their own home. As if the photos and letters I‚Äôd just thrown at their feet weren‚Äôt important.

I looked down at my hands. They were shaking.

The door creaked behind me, and I whirled.

Ewing stepped in, closing it gently behind him.

‚ÄúThanks for waiting,‚Äù he said.

I didn‚Äôt answer. Just stared at him, my expression flat.

He gave a little nod, like he understood the silence. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going to go over the stuff you brought in. I filled them in on what I could. But it‚Äôs late, and they‚Äôve been on shift a while.‚Äù

I folded my arms. ‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd I told them we can pick up again first thing in the morning. Let you get some sleep. You‚Äôve had a long day.‚Äù

I laughed just once, short and bitter. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what this is? You‚Äôre basically sending me to a corner..‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not under arrest, Melanie. You‚Äôre not being detained. I can‚Äôt keep you here.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what I meant.‚Äù

He watched me, unreadable. ‚ÄúYou want them to magically solve it tonight. I get it. But things like this don‚Äôt operate like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause they‚Äôre lazy,‚Äù I snapped. ‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôre tired of helping the crazy lady. Because this town hasn‚Äôt seen a murder in ten years and they all forgot how to care.‚Äù

His jaw tensed, but he didn‚Äôt rise to it. He stepped closer instead, speaking lower now.


‚ÄúI‚Äôm on your side. But if you want help, you have to let me do things my way. The lawful way.‚Äù He paused, studying my face. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt just put a hit on Sam and let death solve it.‚Äù

My mouth opened, then closed again.

Ewing didn‚Äôt seem to notice. Or maybe he did, and he just didn‚Äôt care.

‚ÄúBecause let me tell you‚Ä¶‚Äù He leaned one hand on the table. ‚ÄúDeath doesn‚Äôt solve anything. Death is sacred. And it should be treated as such. Anything to do with it shouldn‚Äôt be rushed.‚Äù

His voice had dropped into something softer now. Not gentle just slower. Almost reverent.

‚ÄúEven your parents‚Äô death,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThis investigation needs to be treated carefully. Ritualistically, if you want anything to be done.‚Äù

I stared at him, pulse ticking in my throat.

Ritualistically.

The word echoed in my head like the clang of a church bell.

I didn‚Äôt respond. Not right away. I just kept looking at him.

There was something about his face in that moment. Not the expression just his face itself.

And something deep in my stomach shifted.

What an odd way to describe death. ",2,1748217897.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1kvgm22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Short_Stories/comments/1kvgm22/the_nightingales_and_the_voice_recorder_a_ghost/,The Nightingales and the Voice Recorder - a ghost story,"I found the the voice recorder in the estate sale. I dragged it home thinking I would record my stories on it. My wife shoved it in the top of the closet because she said it was smelly.  It was degassing something that can only be described as old electronics.. 

I really never thought of it again, except it is when the voices started.. At that time it seemed normal. I'd recently lost my job, my life was under stress.  I put the voices I kept here as that - they were happening when I was extremely tired.  

Then my wife decided the best solution to my job loss was that we would up and sell the house ‚Äúas is‚Äù.  We scrambled out of there fast, me I was happy to be rid of the stress of that mortgage.  I had regretted buying that house. I bought it for my wife, she deserved the finest.  I wish I could buy her more.   

My wife didn't hesitant to move.  She'd found a nice, much smaller cottage.  She already had our necessities in the u-haul by the time I arrived home on moving day.  When I asked her what caused her to so rapidly buy that small house, she said it was because the last owner was murdered, the newest occupants had claimed they had seen a ghost and had hard scrambled out of there.  They dropped the price.  Our find. My wife wasn't the least bit reluctant, but I was. I had a weird feeling about the whole situation.

I didn't make a peep about it.  I sat on our new smaller lawn watching the birds, thinking about what a downgrade we had just done.  The morning sun shone on the tops of my feet. I sipped my coffee. I suddenly turned and that was when I saw through the window.  I saw the ghost.  It wasn't what you would expect.  It wasn't a haze.  It was a very, dark stringy inky spot that looked like a bottomless pit.  The Void.  

It was making a very strange rustling noise. I held my breath to my chest, it was the sound of a man talking but with a gravel throat. I ran to grab the voice recorder, just to realize we hadn't brought it with us on the move.  Fumbling on my phone, I tried to figure out how to do a recording on my phone, but I""m older and. these things dont come easy.  I called my wife at work, realizing I should be guilty for bothering her while she was at work.  

""You saw it, too,"" she said before I even said hello. I noticed the air had the smell of foul meat.  ""What are we going to do about it?"" 

What are we, I pondered.  I wasn't sure what to tell her, so I just said, ""It seems we are going to be a party of three for awhile.  Maybe we can get some social media fame from it.""  But I knew before I finished, my wife would be disgusted that I was thinking of social media campaigns instead of job searching.  Her patience had to run thin soon.  

I skipped asking her where she put the voice recorder. Instead I decided it was time to do some housecleaning.  If I wasn't work, at the minimum I would make the house smell good like bleach and lemons.

I went into the top of the closet.  I do mean the very top - it had a cupboard up there.  It looked so decrepit that I felt the door handle might pop right off if I open it.  But like a cat, my curiosity got me.  

What was up there?  

An old dusty blue suitcases from the sixties was up there.  It had a rip on it and it was dry rotted around it.  I pulled it open and it was full of gifts, almost as if someone had dragged it home from Sweden and thrown it up there with all the goodies they bought there.  It had rotten boxes of candies that a mouse had ate, some dry rotted cards and then there it was.

The same picture of the man whose picture framed image was at the bottom of the box with the voice recorder.  

I didn't wait for my wife.

In fact, I did a very strange thing.  I went right back to our old house, the new owners were likely a few days away from move-in.  I pried the window open with the crowbar I had used when we locked ourself out last winter. Dashing to the closet, I snatched the voice recorder.  I dont know why but I expect it to be gone.  

I rapid inhaled a breath.  Despite my good intentions, I'd never used it.  

¬†""It's the birds,"" the voice said. I clued in harder. ""something is wrong with the birds in my yard.  I keep finding them dead by the feeder."" 

I stopped the voice recorder. I ran down the street back to our new house.  

Was there a feeder?  I paced around looking for it.  Holding the speaker to my ear, trying my best to discern if it was the same voice of the ghost.  

""The bird's are speaking to me.  My kids say I lost my mind but I am recording this.  If you are listening to this.  I want you to know the birds got me."" 

I stopped.  I saw no trace of the bird feeder. I walked back to back patio to rest. My head was spinning.  'I'm losing my mind,' I thought aloud.  That is when I noticed the birds were coming and going from the down the hill.  

I went up to put my better shoes on and sure enough there was a ring of dead birds around the feeder.  Some of them had eaten till it looked like they exploded. They must have no owl to reduce their numbers, I thought leaning over to see the dried out bird.  The seemed almost like taxidermy.  

My wife came home.  I didn't want to tell her any of it.  I ran upstairs and hid the voice recorder in the bottom of her knitting drawer.  I knew she's never look there.

""Honey, do you want to go away?""  

I heard her and almost cried.  We don't have the money. 

Moments later I heard my wife call me again from the kitchen. This time I went towards her voice  ""How about Florida,"" she said trembling. When I found her I realized she was pressed against. the wall - scared of the long black streak that was in the room.  It wasn't smelly this time, but instead a damp, cold draft was wafting from it.  

""Yes, Florida,"" I said wondering if *these* same birds could possibly be there. I grabbed my wife's hand, I'll figure out a way to tell her once we get to the coast. ",1,1748217301.0,Short_Stories,0,1.0,False

So far I've had a normal pregnancy besides it just feeling a lot worse than with my daughter. I'm 26f 206lbs and have asthma,anxiety, PD and take labatelol 100 mg. Currently on my second round of antibiotics this month this time for an ear infection. I started beta blockers a year ago due to tachycardia. cardiac work up before pregnancy shows tachycardia and episodes being close to 200 bpm but that my heart is not the cause so they think maybe SVT (never shown on a holter monitor) or just worsened panic attacks. My PVC burden was less than 9%. For the most part the medication had helped with the episodes. I was on metropolol until I became pregnant. I brought up the PVCs and my OB said it's common in pregnancy but they are ruining my ability to function normal. 

They don't always trigger high heart rates it just takes my breath away. A few here and there is fine but they have been getting worse in the last couple of weeks and have been making it hard to sleep. I had my baby shower yesterday and I counted about 20 in a span of 5 minutes and I felt very dizzy before they started. They stopped and then it would happen again. Eating can trigger them. I feel my pulse when I have these episodes and it's just the 2 fast beats a long pause and then a big thump. Sometimes my chest feels very tight. 

My OB said cardiology probably won't do anything because I'm pregnant. My appointment cardiologist is end of July so after baby is born. I haven't talked to my cardiologist because they told me I'm OB responsibility during the pregnancy. I quit smoking a while ago and gained 40 lbs in 2 months if that means anything.

And how should I end it?","Background: ""J"" (30M) and I (30F) have been ""friends"" since middle school. I put friends in quotes because since graduation I've seen J maybe a handful of times and consider them an acquaintance more than a friend at this point. I have no idea which city they live in anymore, what type of job they have, or anything about their life. We have texted on occasion and have added each other on Discord but these communications are infrequent and fairly brief. We drifted, it happens. J is also gay so the guy-pursuing-girl dynamic doesn't come into play here.

One thing to know about my feelings towards J is that most times they're too much. I'm a huge introvert. I hate talking on the phone, I hate unexpected visitors at the door, and I pretty much enjoy my peace and quiet on weekends to wind down from my stressful work weeks. J is quite the opposite and is very outgoing and extroverted to the point that even texting with them is physically draining.

On to the story:

\- I get a text late on Friday about hanging out Saturday. I already have plans, I don't want to hang out with them (it's draining, see above), and I'm in the middle of working a project when the text comes in. I don't respond. I saw the message but by the time I was done with my project I had completely forgotten and fell asleep.

\- Saturday morning, I go about my normal routine. Coffee, take the dog out, get some chores done around the house. I've left my phone on the kitchen counter through most of this and it's still there when I jump into put the finishing touches on my project before meeting my friends for lunch.

Guys, I had missed 5 calls from J. 5 calls in a row early on a Saturday morning when most normal people would be asleep. I also had multiple passive aggressive texts about ignoring J. Like wtf. I was confused and a little pissed so I closed my phone and headed to lunch with my friends after which we had planned to have a LAN party.

7 calls in Discord as I'm trying to have fun with my friends along with a phone call. Finally resulting in multiple successive messages about how bullshit I am and how I need to answer and how J is ""demanding"" attention (their words, not mine). Up until then I honestly was busy, I wasn't actively ignoring J but I had been sidetracked with a bunch of things and plans that had been made weeks ago. I was ready to pull the plug and block J on everything and just be done with it but felt wrong about it so just ignored it and went on with the rest of my day. I can't put into words how absolutely pissed off I was at J at this point and knew any response wasn't going to be pretty.

\- Sunday (today) I had plans to go see some cousins who live on the other side of a major US city. While driving around that city (in 6 lanes of Sunday morning traffic) I get 10 phone calls in a row from J. After the 4th I put my phone into DND so I could at least have access to my maps while trying to navigate the road. I did have a brief thought of answering and screaming at the jerk about how much of an asshole they were being but I didn't. This was followed by a text about how ""disappointed"" there were in me and how they thought we were going to be lifetime friends. I ignored it, as I was driving and also spending time with family.

\--Which brings us to now when I've finally gotten back home from the day and have had time to start sorting through my feelings about the whole situation. I don't consider J really a friend, they're more of an acquaintance nowadays. We used to be friends, but that was years ago. And even then we were school friends, we hung out outside of school maybe once.

And now with the obsessive ""I demand your attention!!!"" energy from them, I'm ready to sever that cord as well. But for some reason I'm hesitant to do it. I guess I don't know how to address it with J or if I should just pull the plug and block them on everything. But it feels even worse to just ghost them. I don't need that kind of energy in my life trying to demand attention and trying to play it off as if we're still in highschool. I've grown up, I've moved on, but I'm not sure what exactly I should do?

TL;DR! semi-harassed by a person I used to be friends with in highschool because they think they're owed my undivided and immediate attention. I want to sever the relationship but am mixed over doing it or how to do it.",2,1748216369.0,relationships,2,1.0,False
1kvgaxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kvgaxe/zippy_the_clown_was_at_every_party_when_we_were/,Zippy the Clown was at every party when we were kids but no one ever remembers hiring him.,"Childhood memories are meant to be soft, warm and nostalgic, like sunlight radiating through a dusty window. But some memories are so traumatic that our brain represses them. Hides them like splinters under the skin, protecting us from the horror, the depravity we witnessed.

My brain did a good job blocking it out for 25 years of my life, but the tweezer in the form of 7 seemingly innocent words, pulled the splinter out. It was the week before my son Blake‚Äôs 6th birthday when he asked me this one, triggering question.

‚ÄúCan I have a clown at my party?‚Äù

That‚Äôs when I started remembering him.

Zippy.

He wasn‚Äôt like the goofy clowns on TV. No squeaky nose or rainbow wig.

He wore red velvet and old fashioned gloves, with five extra fingers stitched into each one. His face was pale, like painted porcelain. He had beady black eyes with no white corneas, just a void of darkness. We all assumed he wore contacts. His mouth was twisted into a gaping smile, not the cute or comical kind, but the deeply unsettling type of smile you‚Äôd see on a horror movie creature.

And the worst part?

He didn‚Äôt juggle. Didn‚Äôt speak much. Didn‚Äôt ride a unicycle spreading laughter and joy.

He just watched.

He was at every birthday party in Hollaway Ridge back in the late 2000s. No one ever remembered hiring him or even questioned the party hosts. No one knew who he was under the makeup or saw him outside of parties. He just seemed to show up.

And now, more than twenty years later, I still remember the way he moved. Not like a man. Not even like a puppet. More like something pretending to understand how bodies work. His elbows bent too far. His knees didn‚Äôt always face the right direction.

But no one noticed. They laughed. Took photos. Thought it was an eccentric little gimmick.

I didn‚Äôt remember the mirror game until I saw one in a Salvos shop last week. It wasn‚Äôt even the same kind but something about its warped and scratched surface made my lungs seize.

He called it ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Hiding in the Reflection?‚Äù

He‚Äôd bring us into the dark bathroom one by one. No adults. Just him, the candle and the mirror.

He‚Äôd whisper: ‚ÄúSay your name backward. Say it with your real voice. Let your reflection say hello.‚Äù

Most kids laughed at the reactions until it was their turns. I never did.

When I said my name backward; Anay, something changed in the glass.

The candlelight bent sideways. My reflection smiled, but I didn‚Äôt. She had too many teeth. Her skin sagged like she‚Äôd been wearing it for too long. And her eyes were black and beady.

They weren‚Äôt mine. They were his.

I faintly remember him muttering something cryptic and ominous under his breath. ‚ÄúNot the right fit, the other one will do.‚Äù

After that party, I stopped having birthdays. My mum said I asked her to. I don‚Äôt remember doing that. I only remember the smell of his wet velvet gloves and something hidden behind that evil smile.

But lately, things have been surfacing. As if they were intentionally swept under the rug and the illusion had just been lifted.

And it wasn‚Äôt just me.

Last Thursday, I got a message from someone I used to go to school with.

‚ÄúHi Yana how are you? Random af question but do you remember Zippy the Clown? My sister saw him. Last week. At her son‚Äôs party. He gave her kid a balloon dog, with teeth.‚Äù

I wanted to laugh in disbelief. But then she sent a photo.

The balloon wasn‚Äôt latex. It was some waxy, yellowed material. The shape was wrong. The dog‚Äôs belly was stitched shut with black thread, like something had been inserted and sealed inside.

The eyes were thumbtacks. The teeth resembled actual teeth. Baby teeth.

I asked my mother if she remembered him. She froze. Her hand started trembling and she dropped her coffee mug. The glass shattered and molten liquid ran all over her freshly mopped floorboards. She seemed unphased by the glass, just frozen in place.

‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt supposed to remember,‚Äù she finally spoke, soft and barely audible.

‚ÄúWhat did he do?‚Äù I asked.

She looked away. ‚ÄúYour father and I made a choice.‚Äù

That sentence changed everything. It was so cryptic but repressed memories started flooding my brain, like a malfunctioning vhs player switching tapes every few seconds.

My body turned to ice. I didn‚Äôt breathe. Didn‚Äôt blink.

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you tell me?‚Äù

She swallowed. ‚ÄúBecause he said you‚Äôd be safe for now.‚Äù

I rummaged through a box in the attic later that night, still in denial. It was labelled E.B

Inside there was:

A drawing, faded and torn. Two girls holding hands. One smiling. One faceless. A half melted birthday candle shaped like a number 6. A velvet glove, too small for an adult hand. Stained with red at the fingertips. A photograph of me. Only‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt.

She had my haircut. My dress. But her face was blurred out, as if her facial features had been erased from the photo.

On the back: ‚ÄúOne to keep. One to wear.‚Äù

I found a VHS tape tucked at the bottom of the box. It was labelled only with the number 6 written in thick, red crayon. Smeared as if someone had pressed too hard.

I still had an old player in the garage so I brought it into the lounge, closed the blinds and nervously pressed play.

The footage was grainy and some moments were incomprehensible due to static. Warped and jittery like the tape had been left in the sun too long.

But I recognised the garden. The sagging clothesline. The half collapsed tent.

And then us.

Two little girls. Matching dresses. Identical smiles. Both blowing out candles together.

The image shook. Distorted. Then settled again.

There he was.

Zippy the clown.

He loomed in the background, head tilted, limbs stiff like he‚Äôd been hung on strings. He didn‚Äôt move unless he thought no one was watching.

But the camera caught it.

Little twitches. Head snapping to one side. Fingers clenching, releasing, clenching again. Inhuman and unorthodox movements.

Then, without warning, the footage jumped. An ear piercingly loud static buzz screeched through the speakers.

Now he was in front of the camera. Close. Too close. Filling the frame.

His mask didn‚Äôt reflect the light like plastic. It absorbed it, like old, rotting flesh lacquered with something sickly sweet.

He didn‚Äôt speak at first. He just stared. His mouth began to move but there was no sound. Just a low wet clicking noise. Like teeth grinding behind the paint.

Then the audio warped back into place and he spoke. Slow. Measured. Childlike, but ominous.

‚ÄúYana Weaver.‚Äù

I froze. That was my name after marriage. I hadn‚Äôt even met my husband when that tape was recorded.

‚ÄúDid you think I forgot?‚Äù

He giggled. High, broken and sinister. Like a balloon stretching too far before it bursts.

‚ÄúYou were always the tighter fit.‚Äù

His disturbing grin grew wider and more unsettling. A flake of dried red curled off the corner of his lips like peeling wallpaper.

‚ÄúI liked her better, you know. The other one. Her screams when I was skinning her were like music to my ears.‚Äù

He reached toward the lens, and the video glitched, screen bending like heatwaves. Static bled from the edges.

‚ÄúBut I haven‚Äôt forgotten about you. Because things that don‚Äôt fit stretch nicer over time.‚Äù

Then he leaned in and I could see the depravity behind those pitch black eyes. His voice dropped to a rasp, an animalistic growl almost.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll try your flesh on again‚Ä¶ soon.‚Äù

He turned. Walked backward, impossibly fluid. Still staring directly at the camera as his body faded into the background.

‚ÄúOne to keep,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúOne to wear.‚Äù

He blurred into background and the sounds of the birthday party resumed.

I didn‚Äôt sleep that night, because what on Earth had just happened. Surely I was hallucinating. Stress induced I bet.

The house was eerily quiet, almost too quiet. The air felt heavy and the floorboards creaked a lot more frequently than usual. I could hear noises in my son‚Äôs room down the hall but when I went to check on him, he was fast asleep.

But there, resting on the drawer, was a balloon giraffe.

Its legs were tied in knots. Its neck hung limp. Its eyes were marbles: deep red, almost veined. And inside its stomach, something moved when I touched it.

I confronted my mum again.

‚ÄúWhat did you give him?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt speak. Just handed me a letter.

It was old, mildewed and smelled like rust. There was no stamp. Just a wax seal pressed in the shape of a hand with an abnormal amount of fingers.

Inside scrawled hastily in lipstick red ink:

‚ÄúEvery parent chooses. One to keep. One to wear. When they stop fitting, I‚Äôll return for the other.‚Äù

I could feel him getting closer. It wasn‚Äôt just traumatic memories and ‚Äúhallucinations‚Äù anymore. I could feel his presence drawing near.

I don‚Äôt sleep anymore. Not really. Because the silence in this house isn‚Äôt real silence. It hums. It vibrates. It breathes.

The walls groan like lungs stretched too thin. The air feels thick with something not quite present, but not gone either.

And at night the baby monitor crackles. Not white noise. Something closer to a breath. A wet, wheezing laugh like a dying man choking on his last meal.

This morning, Blake looked at me with eyes too old for his little face. He smiled wide, wider than humanly possible and said:

‚ÄúZippy‚Äôs almost inside now.‚Äù

I asked what he meant. He just tilted his head.

And for a split second I swear his skin didn‚Äôt fit right. Like something underneath was stretching it, breaking it in. His eyes flickered black. Too long. Too deep. Too familiar.

I don‚Äôt know what Zippy is. A demon? A god? A skinwalker in a velvet circus suit?

Maybe he‚Äôs older than those names. Maybe he‚Äôs the reason we invented them.

All I know is that he feeds on forgetfulness. He grows in the gaps. In the lies we tell ourselves about what never happened.

And once I remembered... once the illusion cracks...

You start to feel it.

The seams at the edges of my skin. The zipper teeth beneath my spine. The gloved hands slipping into my flesh like a costume.

I wasn‚Äôt spared. I was saved for later. Savoured like dessert after a rich main course.

And now he‚Äôs coming to try me on.",7,1748216362.0,nosleep,1,0.89,False

1kvg7kg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kvg7kg/aitah_i_set_my_client_up_to_show_his_creepiness/,AITAH: I set my client up to show his creepiness in front of his supervisor?,"TL;DR: I didn't know a creepy client was in a rocky contract situation and purposefully set him up to expose his inappropriate intentions towards me in front of his colleagues and boss in a group training.

When I (f, then 24) was younger, I didn't realize that the company I was working for was taking advantage of me as a young woman to recruit clients. Coming from a rural area, I was so (kind of embarrassingly) eager to prove that the degree I worked so hard for meant something, and believed my boss when she told me that I was requested specifically to train our private clients (I was teaching execs and supervisors a proprietary program) because of my teaching style. 

Finally, the day I guess it clicked for me was when a 42 year old guy who ran a big chain of clothing stores here in Europe (that were recently sold to a much bigger conglomerate), the executives, and brains (IT, market researchers etc) of which were taking our courses that week. We had separate courses for their departmental/division needs for the first half so I got him because he was the only one representing his clothing segment.

 Within two hours he somehow had brought the topic around to joking about his girlfriends, his baby mama, and his sexual preferences no less than four times. I didn't have any clue what to do other than to try and pretend to laugh and go back to the next slide on the training module. 

That day I actually had just gotten back from a morning church service I went to with a friend and was wearing a skirt and cardigan and probably looked like a grandma. But when we got up for our lunch break he looked me up and down and said, ""the secretary look is AMAZING"", so I ran back to my office to try not to cry and calm down because I was beginning to realize I didn't have anyone to go to about this (no HR, this was a family run company). 

I can't remember how I got through the rest of that day, other than him asking me to quit and be his ""assistant"", and when I asked about the duties, really confused because I had nothing to do with his sector, he said ""nothing you couldn't handle once I give you enough training, but it will probably take quite a while and I'll need to train you myself"", which made no sense because all I had done was read slides, he had no idea what my competencies were, (which now I know was not his point). 

As he was leaving I was handing my class notes to the secretary when his colleague came out of the other instructional room for his modules and my client/student asked if his friend had seen my body and something, ""dumb and classic, it's a vibe"". And the mention of ""dumb"" is where I got triggered.

So I did a bit of trading and offered my own colleague Monday morning off, that I would take every student from the company for a group instruction day because they were ready to all start the shared units anyway. I walked in five minutes late, and the SOB had the audacity at 8 in the morning to WHISTLE, in front of everyone. But that helped motivate me in my plan because I after all I was wearing my grandma's vintage knit skirt and blouse set with those pantyhose with the lines up the back, rag curled hair, heels, red lip, smokey eye all of it. 

Folks, the PowerPoint modules we ran through the whole day, on every single slide, as a footer said, ""Material of X Company, created using the research of Jane Doe, PhD"".  And I proceeded for the next eight hours to speak exclusively and ONLY to the six engineers and other C-suite people I had brought in from the other rooms about the changes in computation they needed us to make in the software, the research I had been helping two friends do at the uni who were doing work/study with their company, and the instability of the older software they were phasing out.

Everything was wrapping up at about 4:30 when at the last coffee break my creepy client's boss, interim CFO of the company that had just bought his chain 2 months before (and who I later learned had forced acquired execs into some kind of probationary situation during transition), said ""[El-Creepo] has been really quiet today since this morning, he was your student last week, did he seem fine then?""

It was as if heaven shined down. Not only had I been able to wrap up all the units in the full day course to rid myself of this guy, I didn't have to carry out the rest of my plan which was to complain to one of the engineers, who was a friend of a friend about the comments and whispering I heard about myself from El Creepo at lunch break. (And no, don't come at me in the comments about eliciting this shit. I'm a woman with a degree and can dress however I want with the expectation of no comments being made about me.)

So I turned to Mr Big Boss and said, very sweetly, 
""Actually I was wondering about that myself, because on Friday he offered me a job to be his personal and private assistant, but said he would need to train me a lot as I was under-qualified to be an assistant, but maybe you can explain the role he was talking about? Does he have his own, separate system he's also working with?""

Big Boss's eyes widened he mumbled something about 'oh I'm sure he knows his market needs"" and excused himself. Not only did I not ever hear back from the creep who said he was going to call to interview me (hah), the Big Boss wrote to my own boss to give me some kudos on my professionalism and ""discretion with proprietary company knowledge and interactions"". 

I found out a few months later El Creepo was (forcibly?) relocated out of the new luxury offices they had just built and was providing ""on site consulting"" out of a floor manager's office in our capital city. But maybe he was just trying to train a new assistant üòÇ",71,1748216083.0,AITAH,10,0.98,False

So i've been diving deep into NLP for the past few months, and wanted to share a project I finally got working after a bunch of late nights and wayyy too much coffee.

I built this thing called InsightForge-NLP because i was frustrated with how most sentiment analysis tools only work in English and don't really tell you¬†*why*¬†something is positive or negative. Plus, i wanted to learn how retrieval-augmented generation works in practice, not just in theory.

the project does two main things:

1. It analyzes sentiment in multiple languages (English, Spanish, French, German, and Chinese) and breaks down the sentiment by aspects - so you can see exactly what parts of a product review are positive or negative.
2. it has a question-answering system that uses vector search to pull relevant info from documents before generating answers. basically, it tries to avoid hallucinating answers by grounding them in actual data.

I built everything with a FastAPI backend and a simple Bootstrap UI so i could actually use it without having to write code every time. the whole thing can run in Docker, which saved me when i tried to deploy it on my friend's linux machine and nothing worked at first haha.

the tech stack is pretty standard hugging face transformers, FAISS for the vector DB, PyTorch under the hood, and the usual web stuff. nothing groundbreaking, but it all works together pretty well.

if anyone's interested, the code is on GitHub:¬†[https://github.com/TaimoorKhan10/InsightForge-NLP](https://github.com/TaimoorKhan10/InsightForge-NLP)

i'd love some feedback on the architecture or suggestions on how to make it more useful. I'm especially curious if anyone has tips on making the vector search more efficient , it gets a bit slow with larger document collections.

We decided to go get some coffee (decaf for me because of the jitters on meds) and I asked if we could walk for at least part of the meeting, as having some small activity helps me with long conversations. She said she didnt want to walk and it would be hard for her to write down notes.

We were at 1 hour and 15 minutes into out meeting when I was mentally checking out and needed to use the restroom. I excused myself and was back 15 minutes later. (I realize this is a long time in the bathroom but my stomach was upset, I have had gastrointestinal issues, and with the medication it's been more difficult to maintain my diet)

When I got back I requested to walk again, as I was checking out mentally and just needed to not sit for a bit. She expressed frustration and told me it was ridiculous that I used the restroom that long/she didnt want to walk. She continued saying that it's frustrating my medication seemed to not actually help with my focus, as an adult should be able to sit down and have a meeting for 2 hours without stopping.

After some back and forth of disagreement she finally agreed to walk but had a sour attitude. We walked less than a block when I just said we should go. She snapped back and, honestly, I lost my cool.

To wrap up, what I said was, it was unjust for her to make assumptions that, on 1 week of meds, I would just be a completely different person and it was very upsetting that there seems to be no compromise/mercy on her side for me with these kind of things.

We picked up the kids, went home, and haven't talked sense.

And yes, that means I can cook. I‚Äôm short, 5‚Äô6. What I lack in height I make up for in sarcasm. I have brown eyes and brown hair and I tend to appear a bit like a 1940s hipster. I‚Äôve frequently been labeled by others as old school, old fashioned, old world, old souled, and even neurodivergent. 

I enjoy witty banter and deep philosophical discussions. I‚Äôm passionate about things like art and history and music and literature. I actually work in the publishing and writing industry (and I DoorDash as a side gig). I love cats. Dogs too, but mostly cats. I‚Äôm Deadhead and in my earlier, younger life, I flirted with outlaw tendencies. I‚Äôm not necessarily reformed, I‚Äôm just older and wiser now. 

I was married for what amounted to 17 years, and I‚Äôve been on my own for three. And yes, my divorce was a major trauma for me. I suit the married lifestyle quite well. I love Harry Potter (Slytherin and proud) and I have a sticker of the deathly hallows on my car. A love for baseball runs deep in my DNA, as I am a fourth generation St. Louis Cardinals fan. My comfort shows are The Office, South Park, Family Guy, and House. 

I idle extreme introversion with strong hermetic, even agoraphobic tendencies. If you looked up the word homebody in the dictionary, you‚Äôd see a picture of me there, waving at you. I draw most of my strength from my house, my home. Home is my sanctuary. I play guitar and piano, and I used to perform in coffee shops and dive bars in my early 20s. 

I‚Äôve struggled with certain mental illnesses all my life. My life has been extremely hard, harder than a lot of people experience, if I‚Äôm being honest, but I‚Äôve never let go of my Romantic notions of love and magic. My old life left me scarred. But not defeated. Though it‚Äôs been hard, my life has not been without excitement and interest. I‚Äôve been everywhere and I‚Äôve seen a lot. I‚Äôve basked in the tropical beach sun, and I‚Äôve sat sobbing in a psych ward. And everywhere you can imagine in between, I‚Äôve probably been there. 

This time around I‚Äôm looking for something different. I‚Äôm looking to start it differently. I will not obey the rules of our current dating culture. I want nothing to do with it. I‚Äôm here because I‚Äôm trying something on my own terms. I‚Äôm not here for games. I‚Äôm not here to play. Me posting here is the result of months of thought and planning and deep consideration. I know exactly what I‚Äôm doing here, I know exactly what I hoped to accomplish, and I know exactly what I‚Äôm looking for. I‚Äôm not here looking for a soulmate. The only kind of soulmates I believe in are the ones you see who are in their 90s and they‚Äôve been married for 70 years and they‚Äôve been through all the shit together and made it through. THOSE are soulmates. You don‚Äôt meet them, you craft them over decades of commitment and togetherness. 

But I *am* here looking for a connection. And I know what I mean by that. I know a connection when I see it, when I feel it. The question is, will one come my way?",1,1748214696.0,cf4cf,0,0.6,False

Hello all! I'm posting from an alt account because I met someone through my other account. 

So anyways, I (F21) really like this guy(M26), we've been talking for 3 or 4 days straight and I just really vibe with him. The conversations have never fallen off, even when one of us falls asleep or goes to work we just pick right back up later. I've talked to my current partner about him and she knows everything I know about him. She is lesbian so she wouldn't want a relationship with him per se but wouldn't mind being friends with any of my partners. I can't tell how he feels about me and I haven't asked. I'm extremely nervous (social anxiety) to do that and I don't want to come across as too clingy or that I caught feelings too fast but I just really enjoy his vibe. He lives in the same state as me and even the same county but we've never met before Reddit. 

I want to go on a coffee date or something just to see if we still connect IRL and see if the vibes are still vibing. How soon is too soon to ask him for coffee? Or do I wait for him to ask me?

So i've been diving deep into NLP for the past few months, and wanted to share a project I finally got working after a bunch of late nights and wayyy too much coffee.

I built this thing called InsightForge-NLP because i was frustrated with how most sentiment analysis tools only work in English and don't really tell you¬†*why*¬†something is positive or negative. Plus, i wanted to learn how retrieval-augmented generation works in practice, not just in theory.

the project does two main things:

1. It analyzes sentiment in multiple languages (English, Spanish, French, German, and Chinese) and breaks down the sentiment by aspects - so you can see exactly what parts of a product review are positive or negative.
2. it has a question-answering system that uses vector search to pull relevant info from documents before generating answers. basically, it tries to avoid hallucinating answers by grounding them in actual data.

I built everything with a FastAPI backend and a simple Bootstrap UI so i could actually use it without having to write code every time. the whole thing can run in Docker, which saved me when i tried to deploy it on my friend's linux machine and nothing worked at first haha.

the tech stack is pretty standard hugging face transformers, FAISS for the vector DB, PyTorch under the hood, and the usual web stuff. nothing groundbreaking, but it all works together pretty well.

if anyone's interested, the code is on GitHub:¬†[https://github.com/TaimoorKhan10/InsightForge-NLP](https://github.com/TaimoorKhan10/InsightForge-NLP)

i'd love some feedback on the architecture or suggestions on how to make it more useful. I'm especially curious if anyone has tips on making the vector search more efficient , it gets a bit slow with larger document collections.

also, if you spot any bugs or have feature ideas, feel free to open an issue. im still actively working on this when i have time between job applications.",3,1748214361.0,MachineLearning,0,0.72,False

Think again.¬†This¬†is the Cookie Stack event in the rugged world of¬†*Timbersports*, and it's a legit test of precision, balance, and chainsaw mastery.

Held April 26, 2025, at Fort Missoula‚Äîa historic Army outpost from 1877, the¬†**UM Woodsmen Pro/Am**¬†brought together some of the toughest timber athletes in the country. One of the most crowd-pleasing events? Cookie Stack. Here's the breakdown:

* A vertical log.
* A mug full of water¬†is placed¬†on top.
* A roaring chainsaw.
* The goal? Slice off¬†**three clean discs**¬†(aka ""cookies"") from the log¬†*without*¬†knocking over the mug.
* Then, balance the stack of three discs‚Äî**with the mug still upright**¬†on a neighboring log
* And here's the kicker: it must be done using¬†*only the chainsaw bar.*



As absurd as it sounds, the skill level is jaw-dropping. One wrong move and the mug tips‚Äîgame over.

Some say it used to be a¬†*beer mug*¬†instead of water, and while there's no definitive proof, it makes sense. Lumberjack lore has always been one part fact, one part folk tale.



HINESight Entertainment sponsored this event because it's precisely the creative, wild, and skill-based content the world needs more of. Precision meets power. History meets sport. Who doesn't love a chainsaw challenge ending with a bear growl and a Cannonball Run quote?



Would¬†*you*¬†trust your coffee cup to your chainsaw hand?

We have renovated a home together, and I will be honest, my husband did quite a fair chunk of the work. I was struggling with my pregnancy, in and out of hospital multiple times, and other than painting and sanding, I unfortunately couldn‚Äôt be much more help than that. I had an even harder labor that lasted a week and ended with an emergency C-section after my son‚Äôs heart rate dropped dangerously low. Now, during our 3 years together, I have cooked, cleaned, taken care of the house, always done the grocery shopping, gotten up in the night 90 percent of time for our son, waited hand and foot on my husbands friends when they come over for dinner, cooked for them, bought birthday gifts for his family because he would forget or say he didn‚Äôt have time. I bring him breakfast in bed on most weekends and make sure he has a thermos of coffee to take to work. I should probably mention that I am not a stay at home Mom. I also work full time. But I go out of my way to make sure he has everything he needs. His phone needed fixing so I went out of my way to drop it off to be repaired before I went to work. His phone charger was on the fritz. I grabbed one while I was out because I knew he‚Äôd forget. His friends or family members have a birthday coming up and I make sure to get them a gift while I‚Äôm out so he doesn‚Äôt look bad for forgetting. Yes he vacuums around the house and empties the dishwasher and cuts the grass. I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs lazy. And he also takes good care of our son. So I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs an absent father either. But it was my first ever Mother‚Äôs Day today and I was excited about it. Not for gifts or cards but because I'm someone's mother! I ended up getting up early because our son was fussing after asking my husband twice if he could do it that morning. I just wanted an extra 30 minutes in bed. He didn‚Äôt so I got out of bed to see to him. Only to come downstairs afterwards to find him sat at the table eating his breakfast and enjoying a cup of coffee. He had made one for himself but not me. That ticked me off as the first thing I do when I make breakfast is make him his coffee. Now, that morning I had planned to go and pick up some flowers for my mother and then drop them off at her house. Only to find out he hadn‚Äôt gotten anything for his own mom. He asked if I could pick up flowers for his mother and I said ok. I asked for his bank card and he then said not to bother. As I was going out the door, he said his friend Sam was going to be stopping by. It was news to me and I hadn‚Äôt heard anything about it until then. When my friends come over, I make sure to give him plenty of warning so he doesn‚Äôt feel bombarded in his own home. I wouldn‚Äôt have minded normally, except it was Mother‚Äôs Day. And I stated very clearly that after dropping off my mom‚Äôs flowers, I just wanted to come home and have a relaxing day with my family. I didn‚Äôt want to be playing waitress to his friends. He said he wanted to see Sam because it was his day off. I replied that when I came back I would take over baby duty and he could go to Sam‚Äôs as I really didn‚Äôt want to be bothered today. I left and went out. I felt really bad for his mom so I picked her up a little gift set while I was at the florist. Just so he had something to give her and she felt appreciated. My mom loved her flowers and I stayed with her for a coffee. I came home to find that Sam had in fact come over. I came in and Sam wished me a happy Mother‚Äôs Day. I said thank you and showed my husband the gift I had gotten his mom. He said he would take it to her tomorrow. I felt even worse for her. And if I‚Äôm being honest I‚Äôm not even that much of a fan of his mother. And I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs the same on her end but it was also her day and I wanted her to feel like she thought her son cared. I decided to let it go about Sam being there as I hoped it was a quick visit. Now I should also say that my husband and I enjoy going to the movies when we can. We‚Äôve been making plans to go and see the new Thunderbolts movie, then JW Rebirth. I found out that Sam has invited himself and date night has turned into a get together. I have really bad mom guilt leaving my son, so going to work is hard for me and going out for fun is even worse. So I was actually really, really excited about our upcoming date. Well Sam showed up at 12 and didn‚Äôt leave until 6pm. I was mad. I had planned a nice meal for the two of us that I refused to start cooking until he‚Äôd gone because I knew he‚Äôd invite himself for dinner. He‚Äôs done it multiple times. By this point it was too late as the slow roast would‚Äôve take over 3 hours. My afternoon and evening was gone and I had spent it entertaining my husband‚Äôs friend. He couldn‚Äôt understand why I was mad and said he was sorry Sam stayed so long. I told him I wasn‚Äôt mad he‚Äôd stayed so long, I was mad because he shouldn‚Äôt have been here in the first place. I said I had asked for one thing today. One. And he couldn‚Äôt even respect that. I decided that if he couldn‚Äôt hear and understand me when I spoke clearly, then there was no point in speaking at all. Maybe it was childish, but I decided to give him the silent treatment. I let him bathe our son and put him to bed. I didn‚Äôt bother cooking. I made myself a grilled cheese and let him fend for himself. I enjoyed a hot shower and then got into bed. He came up after and tried joking that he didn‚Äôt realize it was such a big deal. I ignored him. He laughed again and said with the way I was acting, anyone would think he‚Äôd cheated on me. I ignored him again. He then said how was he supposed to fix it if I didn‚Äôt talk to him. I replied that there was no point in wasting my breath if he wasn‚Äôt even going to listen. He said he does listen. I responded that he clearly didn‚Äôt if he couldn‚Äôt understand what I said about today. He told me that Sam said he was coming over and how was he supposed to say no? I said it was simple. ‚ÄúSorry, man. It‚Äôs Mother‚Äôs Day and Kate just wants to relax with me and our son. Maybe some other time.‚Äù He said he was sorry and tried putting his arm around me but I moved away. He said he loved me and he‚Äôd do better next year. I told him not to bother.

1kvfj6e,https://i.redd.it/fdzwcwjxd03f1.jpeg,Burr alignment consistently falls off PLUS low rumbling noise after metal chamber upgrade‚Ä¶ [Baratza Vario 885],"Hello!

I got this old vario 4 months ago, and have learned about the Alicorn alignment method. (I am a bike mechanic, so I am proficient with tools and mechanical issues). 
My problem is that after performing this hyper-alignment the first time, it held for about 2 months. I repeated the process with success per the dry-erase marker test. It lasted another 2 months before experiencing really fast shots on my Rancilio Silvia. 
I decided to upgrade to the metal chamber kit through Partselect.com. It‚Äôs an OEM kit from baratza and seems to be high quality. There is almost no play between the lower burr carrier and the new bushings on the grind chamber and motor plate. Very satisfying. I aligned the burrs again‚Ä¶ everything looks good, but the grind is still inconsistent. I am pulling 60g of coffee out of 17.5g of coffee set at a very very fine setting that would normally get me 36-40 out of the same dose in 25-30sec. After alignment i can clog the espresso machine, forcing an unplanned ‚Äúpre-infusion‚Äù. 
The issue with the grind inconsistency is frustrating, and to add, i am now hearing a very low pitch rumbling noise. Maybe like the belt is slipping, or there is something shaking in there. Every bolt is snug and secure. It sounds like the lower burr is dancing around in the chamber‚Ä¶ but remember, there is no play between the burr carrier and the bushings!

Attached is a video of the noise. 

Please help!

I have also emailed baratza‚Ä¶ but I trust the people have the anwers!
