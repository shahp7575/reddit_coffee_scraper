Prior to my psychiatrist proscribing the latter medication, I was taking L-Theanine 200mg once every morning along with 40 mg Prozac and coffee and felt in a good mood and able to tolerate/engage conversations with people more readily(although this would last 5 hours max and start to wear off as the day progressed).

I tried keeping the same regimen while introducing the 10 mg propranolol into the mix and found it made my anxiety worse. I asked my psychiatrist about L-Theanine and she basically said it was not harmful in conjunction with my prescribed medications. 

My question is, would it make sense to just avoid taking the propranolol or to switch it in place of the L-Theanine? My problem is, without the L-Theanine I feel anxious and not nearly as in elevated mood when my day starts.",1,1757292780.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

1nb9yw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1nb9yw9/all_the_pretty_things/,All the Pretty Things,"I am a reclusive old man living alone in the Appalachian wilderness, and I‚Äôve lived in my little cabin for the better part of 50 years without incident. However, recently, things have started showing up on my doorstep- and the contents are horrifying. 

It started with a note. A sheet of notebook paper I found taped to my door one morning. 

It read, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the pretty things that matter,‚Äù scrawled in black ink in large lettering across the page. On the back, there was a Polaroid. An off-kilter photo of what looked like a chest or box surrounded by trees. 

A bit confused and unsettled, I set the note and photo on my coffee table and went on about my day, journaling and reading. There‚Äôs not much to do in the woods of Appalachia, so my days were usually spent enjoying nature, hunting, and fishing. 

So that‚Äôs what I did, I finished my chapter and journal entry, then set off into the forest, rifle on my shoulder and fishing rod in hand. 

The woods were eerily silent this day, which, if you know anything about Appalachia, is not a good sign. I was confident with my rifle, though, and hiked on, following the path to the river that I‚Äôd taken a million times before. 

However, halfway through the hike, I discovered something that had not been on the trail before:
A bloodied doll head was nailed through the forehead into a towering pine that swayed with the wind, its body nowhere to be found. Below the head, etched into the bark with what I assumed was a pocket knife, the phrase, ‚Äúisn‚Äôt she pretty?‚Äù jagged and messy. 

Feeling the unease wash over me, I decided it was best I return home for the day. The forest remained silent as I trekked back to the cabin, and it felt as though a million eyes were on me with each step I took. I could feel the atmospheric pressure change as thunder clapped overhead and the first droplets of rain began to fall. Making it back home, I locked up extra tight, placing a chair underneath my door handle and locking every window. 

The storm raged that night, and the wind howled outside, rocking the cabin back and forth gently. I had slept with my rifle, being the paranoid recluse that I am, and because periodically throughout the night, I thought I could hear the sounds of footsteps pounding against my front porch- pacing back and forth along the tiny 4x5 space. 

Life was brought to my fears when the next morning, I found a new gift at my doorstep: 
The tattered and dirty shirt that appeared to have belonged to a little girl, between the ages of 4 and 8. 

In denial, I tried rationalizing the experience by telling myself the weather had blown the shirt onto the porch, the wind had swept it up and carried it miles just for it to settle directly on my front porch. An attempt for me to walk away from the situation. However, that rationalization quickly crumbled when I picked up the shirt, and beneath it lay another Polaroid photo:

A little girl standing at a bus stop, oblivious. The same pink and purple butterflies on her shirt as the ones on the shirt I now held in my hands. On the back, in black Sharpie and neat handwriting was the phrase, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt she pretty?‚Äù with a smiley face underneath. 

I immediately loaded up into my old Ford Ranger and made my way to the closest police station, presenting them with the evidence. Looking into their missing persons database, they found a match for the girl in the picture. Only she had gone missing over 30 years ago, and her case had gone cold after about 15 years. I explained the events to the police, with the doll's head and the photo of the chest that I had received two nights ago, and they told me everything I already knew about Appalachia: how people go missing up here by the thousands every year, and how an absurd number of the cases go unsolved. Nevertheless, they assured me they‚Äôd examine the Polaroid for fingerprints and get back to me if they found any clues.

Being a gun owner, I refused any police protection at my residence, and I myself assured *them* that I too would be keeping a close eye out for any suspicious-looking person lurking near my remote cabin.

When I returned home, everything was just as I left it. No signs of any kind of trespassing or vandalism. I stayed in again this night, wanting to be here in case any more gifts arrived on my doorstep.  While I was at my stove cooking that night, through the sound of my radio playing 70‚Äôs rock music, I heard the creeping footsteps again on my front porch. 

I rushed to grab the rifle from my bedroom and came bursting through the front door to find the sight of a pale, sickly-thin man, crouched down and peering into my kitchen window, Polaroid camera strapped around his neck. He was completely nude and bald-headed, and once he saw me, he screeched like an animal before springing over the baluster.

I fired blind shots as he fled at inhuman speed into the woods, leaving shrubbery and branches shaking as he sprinted. I fired another shot into the forest in his direction and heard another screech, but the sprinting persisted. I leaped from the porch and chased as fast as I could through the dense forest, stumbling over roots and running into trees in the darkness. I could no longer hear the footsteps, so I gave up and walked back to the cabin, defeated. 

I did not sleep a wink that night. The whole evening was spent on my porch, waiting for him to come back. Next time, I would not miss. I waited until the sun came up, and no trace of the man returned. Becoming fluent in hunting during my time here in these woods, my first idea was to search for his blood. I had heard him screech again; I could‚Äôve at least grazed an arm, and I could work from that. I searched the whole area and found no sign of blood anywhere. 

Defeated, I returned to the cabin. I went into town that day and bought some trail cameras that I placed around the area and on my porch. I was not going to miss my opportunity to catch or kill this guy again. Days came and went with no sign of the man. My trail cams caught nothing, and gifts stopped appearing on my doorstep. Days turned into weeks and weeks turned into months. I had almost succumbed and settled back into my life of comfort and serenity alone on my mountain until one faithful morning. 

A new gift was on my porch. Not only that, but doll heads were nailed to every tree surrounding the perimeter. It wasn‚Äôt just doll heads, either. Limbs were separated from the torsos and crudely nailed to the trees, making them look like dissected bodies. 

The same message under each display:

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt she pretty?‚Äù

The new gift was a jewelry box, dusty and decaying. Inside were dozens of rusted and bloodied earrings, each one bearing some variation of a butterfly. 

After this, things escalated faster than I could account for. 

I took the jewelry box to the police station and yet again explained the situation to the local police chief. The earrings were taken in for DNA examination, and as the earrings were being removed, a new Polaroid was found underneath the pile. 

It was me, asleep in my bed, completely unaware, taken from beyond my bedroom window.

The chief insisted I have police protection at my cabin, and this time I agreed. This man had managed to find the one blind spot in my trail cams, and now he was toying with me. DNA testing takes anywhere between 24 and 72 hours, so once more, I returned to the cabin, officers at my rear. 

As you‚Äôd imagine, it‚Äôs difficult for me to park my Ranger on my property, let alone two additional police cars. That being said, the officers had to park their cruisers on the dirt road at the end of the driveway. The two officers stayed in their cars the whole night, rendering them nearly useless. That‚Äôs what makes what happened next so frustrating.

It had started to storm again, and lightning strikes flooded the cabin with flashing light every few seconds. Something was off, though, the strikes seemed...out of sync with the storm. I focused in on this and noticed that there would be three quick flashes of light after every *big* flash of light, and then there‚Äôd be thunder. 

Lightning struck again, and in the living room window, the outline of the man came into view. Three flashes came from his face before the outside went dark again. 

Once again, I ran outside, rifle in hand, but this time the man was gone completely, without a trace.
Immediately, I confronted the cops in their useless cars, demanding they help search the area. They dared to seem annoyed with me as we searched the woods in the pouring rain. Finding nothing, the officers returned to their vehicles. By this point, it was around 4 in the morning, and the storm began to let up. Against my better judgment, I allowed myself rest. I awoke to sunshine and birds singing, a stunning contrast to the previous night. 

Stepping onto my porch, in place of a gift, I found dozens of Polaroids of myself arranged into the shape of a butterfly. Right in the center of the collage, I found something that broke me. 

My daughter, laughing as I pushed her on the swing. As happy as could be. 

25 years ago, she had gone missing from our front yard as my wife and I worked around the house. 

Her disappearance broke me and my wife apart, and we divorced soon after, leading me to move here, into this cabin. 

I felt my heart break all over again, and I began to break down. I was absolutely grimaced to find that the police cars were no longer at the end of my driveway and were nowhere to be found. 

I lost my mind. I stomped through the forest screaming at the top of my lungs for the man to reveal himself, for him to show himself to me, and to stop being such a coward. 

The forest had grown silent again, aside from the sound of leaves rustling around me. The noise surrounded me as if something were running in circles around me, studying me. I couldn‚Äôt even discern where it ended, but when it did, it was immediately replaced with a single sound: 

*click*

My shroud of sanity fell, and I fired shots wildly in all directions. I listened as the unnaturally fast footsteps raced off deeper into the forest, laughing like a banshee.

This was the last I saw of the man for a while. DNA evidence from the earrings came back as a match for 36 different missing children from the 80s and 90s. This time, a whole team came up to my little cabin and searched extensively for miles. Unbelievably, a warrant was served for the search of the cabin itself, which I obliged, too tired to care. 

The search went on for months, and nothing was found. I‚Äôd stare at the pictures of the man, naked on my trail camera, and burning hatred filled my heart. Murderous resentment that would keep me awake at night. 

The last gift the man has left me was his box from the first Polaroid he ever gave me. 

A traveler's trunk that you‚Äôd see on a train, across the top, the phrase ‚ÄúAll the pretty things.‚Äù
I opened it to find dozens of doll heads along with dismembered arms and legs made from hollow plastic. I found a variety of clothing, all with butterflies stitched into the fabric. But above all, I found pictures of dozens of little girls, none older than 12. Blood speckled the top of the pile, and I wanted to throw up, staring into the case. 

I kneeled there over the box, completely lost for words and in a trance for what felt like hours. The one thing that snapped me out of this state was when I heard the rustling of leaves off in the distance, followed by a sound that broke me:

1nb9wzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nb9wzv/you_are_not_a_lost_cause/,You are not a lost cause,"I just wanted to write this so that maybe I can give just the slightest bit of hope to someone out there. 

I‚Äôve been so depressed nothing in the world could convince me that it could EVER get better. My depression started with panic attacks, anxiety and feeling of sadness, despair but with time it turned into pure apathy. It was like a deafening silence. A whole world of nothingness. Like being an observer of a world that I could not partake in. The only feeling I could have apart from the apathy was pure panic and fear. I was dissociating so much that the world looked like a never ending horror movie cartoon. Even in my dreams I was dissociating, having panic and being apathetic. The second I woke up my day started with a panic attack. A literal living nightmare that would never end. All day I was roaming around, every second a panic inducing apathy. Nothing could ewoke the slightest feeling, not even touching spiders even tho I‚Äôve always had phobia of spiders. Not even bad emotions. 

I had been given sertraline but it wasn‚Äôt helping. For months I kept surging, counting down literal minutes of every day. Eventually I made up a plan to end my life. For some reason I went in to a random hospital and demanded to talk to someone, maybe a last resort before actually doing it, and I told my thoughts to a doctor. He sent me to a psych ward. 

The psych ward was filled of the same nothingness and panic. The medicines gave me 6 types of different medicines. They gave me sleep paralysis, made me drowsy and incredibly angry 24/7, which made me feel even more unlovable because I would think about my loved ones and only feel apathy or anger. I couldn‚Äôt be soothed by anyone because I hadn‚Äôt cried in months and had 0 personality. I was completely objective to everything. Eventually I demanded to stop all medicines except for sertraline. I thought I was gonna die. 

At this point my days consisted of googling about antidepressants etc and about people‚Äôs success stories. I did not believe it was gonna help me in the slightest but I almost had to become religious, in the sense that I had to force myself to believe in something that felt impossible: that I was gonna get better. 

I researched angedonia. I read about it and the only advice was to force yourself to do things: eat, go for a walk, whatever. And keep doing it even tho it was pointless and felt like nothing. So I did. I mostly laid pussles and drank tea, which sounds cozy in hindsight but all I was thinking about was trying to survive the day, until I could sleep again. 

I was convinced I was an actually hopeless case. That maybe I had a rare disease or something was just terribly wrong with my brain. It didn‚Äôt even feel like depression cause I didn‚Äôt feel ANYTHING. 

Slightly but surely, however I was starting to feel the slightest feelings. Everyone would talk to me at the psych ward, even tho I wanted nothing to do with them. I made a friend tho, he was kind and funny. He could sometimes almost make me smile. I heard crazy stories from crazy people (like myself). 

One day, I woke up. The window was slightly open and it was raining outside. A cold wind was rustling the curtain. I felt a cozy feeling. Then I realized that I just had felt a cozy feeling, after months of feeling practically nothing. I ate some soup with some bread, and it actually tasted good. I started crying into my soup. I realized I was actually crying after months of not crying. Even tho I was sad I felt happy to feel anything. This day would give me hope to continue on. This was 2021. 

It‚Äôs years later and it‚Äôs not been an easy ride. But slowly and surely I‚Äôve found myself again. I started having feeling, being able to laugh again, to feel fear, sadness. I realized I cannot escape my feeling because that will erase all feeling and fortunately sertraline finally made my anxiety/panic/dread go down enough that other feeling could start taking place. Like sadness but also laughter.

I‚Äôve learned to be kind to myself when no one else is. To find humor in the world‚Äôs darkness. To give myself time to cry, but also keep on fighting even when I want to give up and fall back. 

I know none of you will believe me because that‚Äôs the whole point of depression: it feels like you‚Äôre gonna be fucked forever. It‚Äôs like viewing the world through a scary filter, which only highlights and morphs everything scary and terrible, and hides everything beautiful and funny. But I can actually say that things can get better. After what I was thru I don‚Äôt think anyone is a lost case. I‚Äôm not perfectly happy and I have to keep having routines, and taking my meds, SLEEP well, eat and do things, even when I don‚Äôt want to. But now I look forward to coffee in morning and watching my favorite show etc etc. Some days I feel apathetic again but others are really really good ‚ù§Ô∏è

Hang in there. You‚Äôre still here so some part of you remembers a different reality, and I promise it‚Äôs out there. One day at a time. One tiny goal at a time. Do everything in your power to do anything, anything other than laying in bed. You‚Äôre fucking strong.

Even tho depression is the most intense feeling of isolation: I promise you that you‚Äôre not alone in your experience. Someone out there knows exactly how you feel but think no one would ever understand. You‚Äôre not a lost case.",2,1757292445.0,depression,1,1.0,False

I am going to attempt a tripel karmeliet next weekend following the recipe from Candi Syrup, which calls for barely, oat and wheat in flaked and non flaked form.

I already bought the ingredients but like the champ that I am I forgot to ask them to mill my oat and wheat. 

I read milling oat and wheat can be tricky and is best done the day of (something about some anzyme or acid that gets freeed up once you mill them?). 

I‚Äôll give it a shot tonight on a tiny pilot batch but was wondering if you had any tips and tricks? I only have a very basic 2 roller mill powered by my drill. I also have an Amazon basic coffee grinder lol recipe calls for 2 lb and 1.5lb of wheat and oat so decent quantities to crush by hand‚Ä¶ 

Picture of my oat and wheat - https://imgur.com/a/geIfoaN

In the future I‚Äôll just simplify things and use flaked oats and wheat but curious if they can be swapped pound for pound for flaked ones?

Thanks for the help!",1,1757292434.0,Homebrewing,0,1.0,False

1nb9odx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discipline/comments/1nb9odx/i_practiced_boredom_for_30_days_and_it_completely/,I practiced boredom for 30 days and it completely changed my life,"I was addicted to distraction. Phone while eating, podcast while walking, Netflix while cooking. I hadn't been alone with my thoughts in probably 5 years.

The moment silence hit, I'd panic and reach for something anything to fill the void.

Then I stumbled across research showing that our brains literally need boredom to function properly. Creative insights, problem-solving, even basic self-awareness all happen during mental downtime.

So I made myself a deal: 30 days of deliberately seeking boredom.

What I actually did:

Morning coffee with zero input. Just me, coffee, and whatever thoughts showed up. No scrolling, no news, no podcasts.

Walks without headphones. 15 minutes daily of just walking. And thinking. Or not thinking.

Meals as meals. Food and silence. That's it. Absolutely brutal at first.

Bathroom breaks stayed bathroom breaks. No more scrolling on the toilet. Just sitting there and doing nothing.

5-minute wait rule. Before grabbing my phone when bored, I'd wait 5 minutes and see what happened. Most of the times I didn't scroll at it.

Day 3: I almost quit

My brain felt like it was vibrating. I was anxious, irritable, couldn't focus. I kept reaching for my phone and finding nothing there. It was like digital withdrawal.

Day 8: Something shifted

During my boring walk, I randomly remembered this song my dad used to play when I was a kid. Then I started thinking about calling him. Then I actually did call him. Best conversation we'd had in months.

That's when I realized my brain had been too cluttered to access my own memories.

Day 12: The idea came

I solved a work problem that had been driving me crazy for weeks. Just out of nowhere while washing dishes in silence. Then I got an idea for a side project. Then another one. I realized solutions come to us when we let our brains rest.

It was like my brain had been waiting for permission to think.

Day 18: I looked forward to being bored

This was the weirdest part. I started craving those quiet moments. My morning coffee ritual became sacred. The silent walks felt like therapy. I was happy to be alone and peaceful.

Day 25: Everything felt different

Colors seemed brighter. Food tasted better. Conversations were deeper because I was actually present instead of thinking about what to check on my phone next.

What actually changed:

I remembered who I was. Turns out I have opinions, preferences, and ideas that aren't influenced by whatever algorithm I'd been feeding my brain.

My sleep improved dramatically. When your mind isn't constantly stimulated, it actually knows how to rest. Who knew?

I became a better friend. Really listening to people instead of waiting for my turn to talk changed everything. Friends started coming to me with real problems, not just surface-level chat.

Work became easier. Problems that used to stress me out suddenly had obvious solutions. My brain had space to actually process things.

I got genuinely excited about stuff again. When you're not constantly consuming content, small things become interesting. I spent 20 minutes watching birds the other day and loved every second.

30 days later:

I still use my phone, but it doesn't use me. I still watch Netflix, but I also stare at walls sometimes. And those wall-staring sessions often end up being the best part of my day.

The person I was avoiding with all that distraction turned out to be someone worth knowing.

Try eating one meal today without any entertainment. Just you and your food. See what shows up in your head.

I called him and congratulated him and all that. What I didn‚Äôt tell him, and don‚Äôt plan to, is that I‚Äôm not sure this is a good thing for him. I‚Äôll get the positive out of the way. He‚Äôs established himself in our hometown. He‚Äôs got a good job. He is an engineer. He‚Äôs got friends in the form of a rugby club here. Him and his girlfriend seem to have a good relationship and they already live together.

However, he drives while drinks. We were carpooling to a cousins wedding not too long ago when one of my other cousins handed him a mug and he said ‚ÄúHey, by the way, I know there‚Äôs booze in this but is there at least coffee?‚Äù And he drove us to the wedding and later casually dropped on the way back that he was drunk the whole time. Our family is too casual about alcohol. We start going to bars and drinking at 18 instead of 21, with the encouragement of our parents. Him and I were practically raised in a local bar. Coincidentally, it‚Äôs the same bar where he met his pregnant girlfriend.

And we have had a complicated relationship for a reason. A few years ago, I came out as gay and he emotionally abused me. He helped another sibling detain me for a night. He pressured me to smoke weed and then he screamed at me for hours. He reduced me to tears and he kept screaming. He told me that instead of being gay, I was actually a pathological liar who gaslighted herself and was trying to gaslight him. 

It ended because I cut off the whole family and then moved away without giving them my address. That was years ago and he has accepted it since then. I don‚Äôt know if he regrets it or if I should let it go. But I remember thinking at the time ‚ÄúI hope he never has kids. If he treats me like this, what would he do if he had a kid who was different in some sort of way?‚Äù And now I‚Äôm thinking it again.

For the record, I‚Äôm keeping my mouth shut. Nothing I say can change the course of events either way. And I don‚Äôt see what good that voicing my concerns can do considering how distant we are.

TLDR: Despite the fact that he is in an ideal spot to have a kid, I‚Äôm not happy because he also does stupid things with alcohol and I don‚Äôt think he can control his anger.",1,1757291334.0,AITAH,4,0.67,False

1nb9iip,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1nb9iip/glasses/,Glasses,"These new glasses are simply amazing. I hadn‚Äôt realized how bad my eyes had gotten, or how badly I needed a new prescription, but I can finally see everything again. The flowers on the window sill. The pattern in the marble counter top, which coincidentally could use a better cleaning than it‚Äôs been getting. The fine details on the painting that hangs in the living room. The creepy ghost staring at me from the corner. The magazines piled on the coffee table unread.

The creepy ghost staring at me from the corner?! I take my glasses off for a second, and everything returns to a blurry mess, but if something was standing in the corner I should still be able to somewhat make it out. Not moving my eyes from the corner, I slowly put my glasses back on. Sure enough, she is still in the corner, staring at me. 
Tentatively, before I even have a chance to consider what I‚Äôm doing, my voice creaks out, ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù The ghost moves its head almost imperceptibly, but with my new glasses I could certainly tell that the movement was in response to my involuntary utterance and I had her attention. Damn, these glasses are good.

‚ÄúYes, hello, you there in the corner? I‚Äôm sorry, you there sounds kind of rude but I don‚Äôt really know what to call you, I‚Äôve never spoken to a ghost before.‚Äù The ghost proceeds to look around, obviously as confused as I am at the moment.

 ‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm talking to you. The woman in the corner of my living room. I don‚Äôt mean to be rude, but what are you doing here?‚Äù

She seems to ponder the question while trying to find her voice, like she hasn‚Äôt spoken or been spoken to in so long, she‚Äôs forgotten how. I‚Äôd feel almost sorry for her if I wasn‚Äôt preoccupied being so damn freaked out. I mean, it‚Äôs not every day one gets a life changing pair of glasses only to discover proof of the afterlife looking right at them from the corner of their living room. There really should be some kind  of disclaimer about this sort of thing. The next time I see Dr. Whittaker I‚Äôm going to‚Ä¶

‚ÄúYou see me?‚Äù She replied finally, her voice a mix of beautiful sorrow and pants shitting terror that shook me from my thoughts and made me wish for a moment that I had been born without ears.

""See you. Hear you. All of it. Wait, why didn‚Äôt I ever hear you before, all I did today was get new glasses, my hearing is the same as always?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere has been‚Äù she appeared to think for a second ‚Äú4 other families here since the last time I spoke, and just as many before them that didn‚Äôt hear me, or at least pretended not to hear me.‚Äù Her words becoming more laced with anger as they reached the end of her sentence. 

Eight families before me. This ghost has been here that long, with no one to talk to or acknowledge her existence. Or inexistence. Whatever it is you would call haunting the corner of someone‚Äôs living room. Knowing the previous tenets had rented here for about 5 years, and assuming the others stayed around the same length give or take a year, that‚Äôs 30 to 48 years of being alone.Based on her clothing, that may even be a conservative estimate. 

I can feel myself shifting from my weirdly calm terror, into a slightly frightened and trepidatious form of sympathy. I guess I‚Äôm invested now. ‚ÄúWhy are you here? I mean, not in my living room so much, but just in my house in general?‚Äù

‚ÄúI cannot leave‚Äù, she moaned sullenly. ‚ÄúMy murderer buried my body in the basement, and I cannot leave this place until it is properly laid to rest, and my killer found.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhoa, whoa, whoa, so, you‚Äôre telling me you were murdered, and your bodies been here the whole time? No one ever found you?‚Äù 

The ghost, staring at the floor towards where her feet would be, if they were corporeal and visible, nodded her head sadly without looking up.

‚ÄúAnd your murderer was never caught?‚Äù I asked, my voice showing my obvious annoyance and dissatisfaction for the unfair end my ghostly visitor endured. 

Still staring at the floor, she shook her head again, conveying no with the same sadness. 

‚ÄúWhat a piece of shit.‚Äù I said, which was clearly not what she expected to hear because she quickly looked back to me now, the dark, hollow circles where her eyes would be, if she still possessed them, almost giving the impression that she was crying. Can ghosts cry? I have to snap out of it and stop getting so side tracked. 
‚ÄúNot you, you‚Äôre not a piece of a shit. The guy who did this to you, he‚Äôs definitely a piece of shit. I‚Äôm sorry. Do you know anything about him that might help us find him? Maybe we can call the police and give them the location of some kind of evidence that will get them to arrest him or something? That might work right?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù she murmured, almost a whisper. ‚ÄúI think I missed my chance to move on. No one ever heard me. No one ever found me. He must be long dead like me now.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait a minuet‚Äù I say, holding up a single finger like some Saturday morning cartoon character who just had a light bulb appear over their head, instantly making me feel like a doofus for doing so. I put the finger and hand down and for some reason hope I didn‚Äôt just make a complete fool of myself in front of the ghost. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre trapped here because your body is buried here, then, if he IS dead, maybe he‚Äôs trapped where his body is buried as well.‚Äù 

The ghost continues to stare at me, eerily unmoving, like one of those wind up dolls that you know can move, but only in an unsettling way, and only if someone turns its key. I‚Äôm beginning to think she might think I‚Äôm a little slow, and she‚Äôs rethinking every choice that ever led to her standing in this corner, in my presence, needing my obviously inadequate help. 

‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm saying is, if he IS dead, and if we were able to find his ghost, would it be possible for you to get your closure that way, and move on?‚Äù She seems to perk up at this suggestion, hopefully restoring some of her faith in me not being a complete idiot. I‚Äôm not sure why that should matter to me, but for some reason in this moment, it does. 

‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù She says finally. ‚ÄúMaybe if I can confront him and make him answer for what he has done, my soul can finally rest‚Äù 

‚ÄúOK, so we have the start of a plan yeah?‚Äù I say, mostly to myself. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really not sure what to do next though. I need to think for a minuet.‚Äù 

I cant believe this is happening right now. All I wanted was to come home with my new glasses and catch up on all the shows I‚Äôve missed due to them looking like I was watching them through an inch of cotton balls with my old ones, and relax. Now I‚Äôm playing Nancy Drew with some lost soul, planning to go track down her killer, who‚Äôs potentially also a fuck damn ghost, and God damnit these glasses are too good. Whoever made these should get a raise. But also get fired because it's kind of not cool just giving out glasses willie nilly that make it so you can see the ghosts of people who died before you were in diapers. Especially to someone like me. I‚Äôm barely responsible enough to take the garbage out before the truck is pulling up to my stop every week, I‚Äôm certainly not ready for this pseudo ghost whisperer responsibility. 

I was so lost in my thoughts, I hadn‚Äôt noticed I had sat down on the couch, or that she had moved from the corner and was now standing about two feet from me. I felt like I should feel some kind of abject horror at my current situation but instead I mostly just felt ashamed that I hadn‚Äôt noticed her before today. 

‚ÄúOk, so, I guess first things first, if you‚Äôre stuck here because your body is buried here, and we have to get you from here to where ever he‚Äôs buried, we‚Äôre going to have to dig you up. Well, I mean, I‚Äôm going to have to dig you up, I‚Äôm pretty sure you can‚Äôt hold a shovel, on account of you being a ghost and all.‚Äú 

I looked up from the couch towards her and she continued to stare at me. This close up, my initial feelings of abject terror start to creep back in, if only for the simple fact that staring a ghost straight in its eyeless, unmoving face while you‚Äôre close enough to reach out and touch each other is just something most people never experience in every day life. 

‚ÄúI have a shovel out in the shed, I‚Äôll run out and grab it really quick, then you can show me where to dig I guess.‚Äù I say, as I start to stand up and move past her. As I do, I notice a very significant chill in the air seemingly radiating off of her. I shiver slightly as I walk towards the door, trying to keep her in my eyesight as I do.

Stepping out onto the stone walkway, I wonder to myself, ‚ÄúAm I going crazy?‚Äù as I walk over to my shed to retrieve the shovel. All things considered, I think it‚Äôs a very valid question to ask myself. After all, it does seem statistically more likely that I‚Äôm suffering some sort of mental breakdown, than a supernatural event brought on by prescription eyewear.

I walk into the shed, still pondering my current grasp on reality. As I turn to grab the shovel, I see someone standing by the wall next me, swinging my fist in instinct at my would be assailant while making a noise that‚Äôs half scream, half obscenity.

I have just enough time to register that the person standing in my shed that made me very nearly piss myself, is in fact, my snow suit hanging on the wall. I unfortunately do not have the time, however, to stop my panic fist from connecting solidly with the wall behind it, cursing loudly as I shake my hand like that‚Äôs going to somehow make things better.

I take a moment to try and collect myself before grabbing the shovel, and a pair of heavy gloves off the nearby shelf. Not even going to risk a blister at this point, because it just might be the proverbial straw that breaks the metaphorical camels back, if I‚Äôm not already having some kind of nervous breakdown. I don‚Äôt need that kind of embarrassment on top of everything else.

I slowly make my way back to the house, in no way ready to do any of this, propelled forward begrudgingly by the fact that I‚Äôll likely never be more ready than I am at this moment anyway, so I might as well just get it done. 

I open the door, heading into the kitchen as I look towards the living room, stopping in my tracks. She‚Äôs gone. I stare out into the living room, seeing nothing amiss, and no sign that there ever was a ghostly woman there to being with. I let out an audible sigh, as I set the shovel down. I feel like I should probably be worried, since this means maybe I really am losing it, but the sudden relief I feel at not having to go dig up a body, among other things, trumps that in the moment, as I make my way through the threshold into the living room to sit down.

‚ÄúHello.‚Äù I hear to the right of me, the voice like the icy wind of the saddest Christmas you could ever imagine, making me jump immediately.

‚ÄúJesus fucking shit Christ! Holy fuck!‚Äù I shout, turning in the voices direction while my body visibly recoils, seeing my spectral roommate standing off to the side of the threshold, seemingly having been looking at the cheap painting hanging there when I walked in.
 
Realizing my outburst must have taken her by surprise, I quickly add, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I‚Ä¶thought I must have been hallucinating or something when I didn‚Äôt see you, and then hearing your voice again so close to my ear, nearly made me jump out of my skin. It‚Äôs not you, I promise, I‚Äôm just a naturally anxious kind of person.‚Äù

She continues to stare at me, unmoving, which I choose to take as her acceptance of my explanation as to why I took the Lord‚Äôs name in vain in such a vulgar fashion in reply to her simple greeting. I walk to the couch and sit down, my body practically collapsing into its cushions, the invisible weight of the day seeming to help push me down.

‚ÄúI just...need a minute. To collect my thoughts.‚Äù I say gently, putting my face into my hands as I close my eyes.

‚ÄúWell, at least that means I‚Äôm not crazy.‚Äù I think to myself. Have to just be thankful for the silver lining‚Äôs I guess. Now I just have to go dig up my ghosts dead body, then help her get closure on her murder by tracking down her killer, wherever they are. I‚Äôm really starting to feel like these glasses aren‚Äôt worth all the trouble, regardless of how good they are. Like, when does it end? Am I going to start seeing ghosts everywhere when I‚Äôm wearing them? Dr. Whittaker is definitely getting an earful when I go in for my next appointment.

Realizing I‚Äôm getting side tracked again, and that I‚Äôve been sitting there with my hands over my face for an exorbitant amount of time, I quickly pick my head up, and, seeing the ghostly woman‚Äôs now about a foot away from me, starting at me, I immediately say ‚ÄúHoly hell! You‚Äôve really got to stop sneaking up on me like that, or somebody‚Äôs going to have to find my body as well when I inevitably have a heart attack.‚Äù before letting out a small, uneasy laugh.
 
She tilts her head slightly, regarding me with the empty holes where her eyes should be, which instantly sends a shiver down my spine, as she says ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù Quietly. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok.‚Äù I say gently. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, today‚Äôs just been‚Ä¶a lot. The most excitement I‚Äôve had lately is deciding which microwaved dinner I want to have every night, so I think my brains just frazzled. I‚Äôll be alright. Before we go‚Ä¶dig you up, let‚Äôs see if we can find out where your killer is. Do you know their name?‚Äù I ask, pulling out my phone.

She seems to regard my phone almost quizzically, before saying slowly in a pained voice ‚ÄúGordon‚Ä¶Gordon Howell is the man who murdered me.‚Äù

I begin searching public records databases, trying to find an obituary notice, at first. Finding none, I begin digging deeper, trying to find any mentions of the name nearby, until I see something that makes me audibly gasp.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs‚Ä¶he‚Äôs still alive.‚Äù I say softly. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs currently living in the nursing home downtown.‚Äù

This unexpected turn of events seems to grab her attention immediately, her generally sorrowful demeanor seeming to dissipate, replaced with a no less unsettling aura of vengeful determination. If I had no idea what was going on, and just ran into her for the first time like this, I would probably literally shit my pants on the spot. Hell, I still might.

‚ÄúYou must take me to him.‚Äù She demands firmly, her voice almost pleading in its calm desperation, steeped in a lifetime of denied closure and peace.

‚ÄúOk.‚Äù I say calmly, trying for once not to focus on all the hurdles we still have to jump to get there. ‚ÄúFirst things first I guess. Let‚Äôs go‚Ä¶dig you up.‚Äù I say, steeling myself for the job ahead as I grab my trusty shovel that I never would have guessed in a million years would be used for such a macabre task. 

I open the door to the basement, flicking the light switch as the cement walls and earthen floor below are suddenly bathed in cool florescent light. I begin descending the stairs, my ghostly companion floating down them close behind me, her presence a steady chill against my back.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶um‚Ä¶where is‚Ä¶your body buried?‚Äù my discomfort written in every aspect of my existence as I try not to think too hard about what I‚Äôm asking or what I‚Äôm about to be doing.

I watch as she silently glides towards the middle of the basement, before stopping and pointing down, wordlessly at the dirt below. 

I too remain silent, as I walk over gritting my teeth, and begin to dig in the area she indicated. Shovel full after shovel full, I steadily make a hole in the earthen floor, creating an equal size mound beside me of the dirt displaced as I go. I lose track of time, completely absorbed in the task at hand, when finally my shovel makes contact with something that is definitely not dirt.

Using my gloved hands, I gently remove the loose earth in that area, revealing a skeletal hand, the pointer finger of which my shovel must have broken off, as it lays there alone beside the rest of the bones it spent its entire existence with up till this point.

‚ÄúShit. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù I say, embarrassed that I kind of accidentally desecrated her body.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ok.‚Äù She says slowly, obviously unsure how to feel herself about it. Guess I at least know grave robbing isn‚Äôt my forte. Not that it‚Äôs something I ever even thought about until right this moment anyway.

Suddenly, I‚Äôm hit with an idea, or, at least the beginning of one. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trapped in this house because it‚Äôs where your body is right?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶believe so, yes.‚Äù She says, clearly not seeing where I‚Äôm going with this line of questioning. I take a breath, hoping what I say next makes up for the fact I careless broke her finger off like a dumbass.

‚ÄúI want to try something.‚Äù I say to her, my voice clearly animated, as I genuinely begin to feel excited for the first time since realizing my glasses had the unexpected side effect of allowing me to see fucking ghosts like some kind of bad ass medium, you know, minus the bad ass part. I grab a rag from a nearby shelf, using it to gently wrap up the severed digit. 

‚ÄúCome on‚Äù I say, motioning for her to follow as I begin to ascend the wooden stairs leading back out of the basement. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt go out to my car in the driveway currently, right? I want to bring your finger out there, and see if its enough to allow you to follow me.‚Äù

I go to the kitchen, opening the door separating the house from the world outside and step out onto the stone walkway. I take a few steps forward, before turning around to see if she‚Äôs following me.

I see her standing in the doorway, glancing around at the world outside of what has essentially been her prison all these years, and I can‚Äôt help but feel terrible all over again at this new reminder of how unfair fate has been to her.

‚ÄúHey. Are you ok?‚Äù I ask gently as I walk back to her, her gaze seeming to fix on me as I approach.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶yes, I‚Äôm ok. It‚Äôs just been so long. I had forgotten how big the world is, after spending so long confined in these walls.‚Äù She says, her voice back to that familiar haunting sadness she displayed when we first spoke. I surprise myself, realizing for the first time it no longer makes me uneasy, even in a primal, illogical way.

‚ÄúCome on.‚Äù I say gently. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm right here with you. Let‚Äôs see if this works, so we can finally set things right for you, so you never have to feel trapped or alone like that again, ok?‚Äù

I stand there beside her, as she takes her first tentative step through the doorway, her ethereal form partially outside the house for the first time since she died. I smile at her reassuringly, before saying ‚ÄúSo, what do you say we go pay that asshole who killed you a visit? I have to make one quick stop along the way, but I think I have the perfect plan.‚Äù

She nods ever so slightly, before fully emerging from the place she‚Äôs been trapped in death, longer than she even got to live, rays of the early afternoon sun scattered from a nearby tree branch passing through her, adding an otherworldly beauty to her that almost makes my breath catch in my throat. As she falls in beside me, we walk to the car, as I say ‚Äúok, so, here‚Äôs my idea‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre here to visit with Gordon Howell you said, correct?‚Äù The nurse in reception says to me with a smile, her voice warm and friendly as she types away at the computer in front of her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll be happy, he hasn‚Äôt had a visitor in the two years that he‚Äôs been a resident here. Let me show you the way to his room quick.‚Äù

As she steps from behind her desk, I return her smile, as I say ‚ÄúYeah, Mr. Howell is very closely connected to a dear friend of mine. They go way back. I know they would have wanted me to stop in and check on him, so I came down as soon as I was able.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just going to make his day. His room is just at the end of the hall there. Number 17. I‚Äôll let you go in yourself so the two of you can have some privacy and catch up.‚Äù She says, as she heads back in the direction of her desk, with a small wave.

I turn back towards Gordons room, walking up and knocking on its partially open door, the number 17 emblazoned on it, looking more like a faded prophecy than an identifying numeral the way time has faded and blurred it‚Äôs edges. I poke my head through the opening in the door, saying ‚ÄúMr. Howell?‚Äù

As my eyes take in the room beyond the door, glancing from the sparsely decorated walls containing a calendar and a single mass print painting of a generic still life, the bowl of artistically rendered fruit feeling especially lifeless in their current environment, to a small, uncomfortable looking bed, it‚Äôs sheets and blanket in disarray, until finally landing on a frail looking man in a wheelchair, sitting in front of a small table by the only window in the otherwise barren room.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù Gordon asks me, as he leans forward in his wheelchair, squinting as he tries to figure out who I am.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just the friend of an old acquaintance of yours.‚Äù I say gently. ‚ÄúShe told me for as long as I knew her that you were an important part of her life at one point, and when I heard that you were here this morning, I just knew they would have wanted me to stop by and check on you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see.‚Äù He says, the look of absolute confusion on his face saying that he actually didn‚Äôt see at all. Before he can give voice to any questions he‚Äôs currently warring with in that head of his, I take the opportunity to steer the conversation.

‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm just glad to see you‚Äôre alright. I fear she may have never been at peace, if I was too late to speak with you, and make sure you have everything you need. Speaking of, I couldn‚Äôt help but notice you squinting, when trying to get a look at me. I actually just left my eye doctors office with a spare set of glasses that should be life changing for you. They‚Äôll have you seeing things that you didn‚Äôt even realize were there before you put them on.‚Äù I say, as I hand him the glasses.

He takes the glasses in an unsteady hand, saying ‚ÄúIt would be nice to be able to do my crosswords again.‚Äù More to himself than anything, as he slowly brings the glasses to his face, putting them on as he slowly looks around his room, his eyes wide in wonder at the new visual clarity the eyeglasses have provided. ‚ÄúDamn, these glasses are good.‚Äù He says softly 

‚ÄúRight?! That‚Äôs exactly what I said.‚Äù I say with a laugh. ‚ÄúBut anyway, I should get going for today. I have to go pick up a friend of mine nearby before heading home. You just enjoy those glasses, and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll see you again soon.‚Äù

I step out of the room, turning to give a quick wave goodbye to him, as I see her standing behind him, and I can‚Äôt help but imagine that if she still had eyes in her head instead of those dark voids where they should be, they would burn with the fires and fury of divine retribution. I turn back around and begin to walk out the way I came in. As I reach the nurses desk, the sound of terrified screaming fills the air, coming from the direction of Gordons room. The nurses eyes widen at the sudden cacophony of unintelligible horror down the hall, as she gets up and quickly makes her way towards the commotion.

I make my way outside, walking around the side of the building until I am outside Gordons window. I can here the muffled, panicked voices on the other side as I retrieve the bundled rag containing the skeletal finger that I had placed there before entering, and walk back to my car, my ghostly passenger already waiting inside it.

I open the driver‚Äôs side door, sitting down as I ask ‚ÄúSo, how did it go? I take it from the screaming I heard that he didn‚Äôt exactly embrace your reunion with open arms and apologies.‚Äù I start the car and begin to pull out of the parking lot, heading for home.

‚ÄúI feel‚Ä¶at peace with it. Especially since I got to look him in the eyes one last time after what he did to me. He‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt survive the shock of being confronted by the woman he killed all those years ago. And I was the last thing he saw in this life. I trust true judgement still awaits him in whatever comes next, so that will have to be enough.‚Äù She says calmly, her voice, for the first time since I met her not tinged with any dark or mournful undertones.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I stand in my basement, answering the occasional question as the police forensics team works carefully to extract and remove the body and any evidence linked to her killing, as they‚Äôre all blissfully unaware that the victims spirit is watching them from the stairs, with the kind of bored detachment usually reserved for activities such as watching paint dry, as they slowly but surely gather what is left of her earthly remains.

When we first returned to the house, I put the skeletal finger back where I originally found it, and, instead of trying to finish digging myself, called the police, telling them that in the process of digging to install a sump pump, I had uncovered human remains. They arrived shortly after my call, but if the officer in charges attitude is any indication, they totally don‚Äôt buy the whole sump pump thing, but at this point, I don‚Äôt even care. It‚Äôs not like they can do anything about it, since I wasn‚Äôt even a toddler when the victim was killed. He asked me some standard questions regarding me with the look of someone just wanting to get talking to the weirdo out of the way so he can go home before the crazy can rub off on him too, while the forensic team got to work.

Eventually, once the officer decided he didn‚Äôt need answers as much as he needed to be done getting them from someone he was convinced was up to something shady, but couldn‚Äôt do anything about it, I headed back upstairs to let them finish up without my presence distracting them. I sit down on the couch, watching as my spectral coconspirator floated slowly into the living room not too long after me, coming to a stop about 2 feet from where I was sitting.

‚ÄúEverything ok?‚Äù I ask her quietly.

‚ÄúYes. They are close to finished I think.‚Äù She says, seeming to think for a moment before adding ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt thank you enough, for everything. I finally feel like I can move on, after all those years watching my chances dwindle away as the world moved on and forgot about me. I had honestly given up.‚Äù She says genuinely, as she glides over to sit beside me on the couch.

I recline back in the cushions, saying ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to thank me, I‚Äôm just glad I was able to help. I‚Äôm just sorry it took this long, for someone to finally see you.‚Äù

We sit there like that for a moment, before officer trust issues and the forensics team begin filing out of the basement as they finish, the officer handing me his card warily as he says they‚Äôll be in touch if they need anything else, while the look on his face is saying he just hopes I lose his card and never end up actually using it to contact him about anything ever again. I watch behind him as the last of the forensics team carries her body out of the house, to their vehicle outside, as I walk the still uneasy officer to the door and close it behind him as he leaves.  I turn back to the living room and see her standing in the threshold, looking at me.

‚ÄúIts time for me to go now. Thank you again, for everything.‚Äù She says, the calm and warmth in her voice a stark contrast to the terrifying sorrow of when she first spoke.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome. You know, you never told me your name.‚Äù I say with a small laugh.

She smiles at me for the first time since this all started, and says ‚ÄúCindy Davis.‚Äù

She raises her hand in a small wave, as she fades away, becoming more and more transparent by the second, until she is gone completely, leaving me alone in my kitchen with the events of the day still running through my head. I walk to the fridge and grab a soda, before sitting back on the couch and turning on the TV to finally start catching up on some of the shows I‚Äôm behind on, a small smile tugging at the corner of my lips, glad I was able to at least help set one terrible wrong in this universe right.

As the episode starts, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm seeing everything finally, for the very first time; no more blurriness or anything. These glasses are seriously amazing.

Long post, didn‚Äôt read : Alaska good 

The absolute best vacation I‚Äôve ever been on and Alaska will be unmatched for a long time. 

Itinerary : 

Flew into Anchorage on Tuesday August 26th. Arrived at 630pm, picked up an SUV from Alaska 4x4 and went to Moose Tooth (saw two moose in the road!) and that pizza was honestly pretty good. Arrived at the Airbnb and went to bed.

Woke up Wednesday August 27th and headed to the Alaska Railroad station. Went down to Seward and did a Kenai Fjords tour. (Resurrection Bay) Weather was super cloudy and rainy but still saw some great views. High recommend. Got back and took the train back to Anchorage that night. 

Woke up Thursday August 28th and started the drive to Talkeetna. Planned for a Denali flight seeing tour but was rained out. The weather was atrocious. They let us know hours before it was canceled so that was nice! Decided a pit stop at Hatcher Pass for a UTV tour, so much fun!!!! Walked around Talkeetna for a little bit and then started the drive to Denali. Arrived around 830pm. Wanted to pick up a Prospector pizza but they don‚Äôt do take out orders except for certain times. Ended up having some good Asian food at a hidden and inconspicuous spot. 

Woke up Friday August 29th and weather was still bad and super cold. Planned the East Fork Transit tour ($30 and the same road as the more expensive tours and same stops etc). Got about 5 miles in and they turned around because it was snowing!!! Went back bummed but hopped on the Savage River Loop bus and went out further and did that while it was snowing. Such a magical experience. Saw the Kennel Dogs!! 

That night, we had reservations for the Serbian restaurant in town (Moose-AKAs). Highly recommend. Chef Michael is a delight. Everything was incredible. 

Saturday morning, we woke up to the most beautiful weather ever and it stayed that way. K2 Aviation let us reschedule so we left Denali early and arrived in Talkeetna. Still so beautiful and sunny! Got in the plane and headed towards Denali. It was cloudy up there but what an incredible experience. We landed on Ruth Glacier and were treated to such a gorgeous view. Flew in the co-pilot seat on the way back. 

Once we returned, we started the drive to Palmer for a helicopter tour of the Chugach Mountains & Knik Glacier.  This is the absolute bucket list experience EVERYBODY needs to experience once in their lives. We did three landings, doors off, and a semi polar plunge. We landed on a remote spot overlooking a large glacier, we landed on a remote spot with a small glacier waterfall, and lastly, on the glacier itself and dipped our feet in the water (freezing!!!!) 

Got back and drove to Anchorage. 

Slept in on Sunday August 31st, returned the rental car to the airport and waited for the ACT (Alaska Cruise Transportation) bus to take us to Whittier. We made stops at Beluga Point, AWCC, a few glacier stops and a super cool salmon spawn spot. 

Boarded the Holland America Nieuw Amsterdam. Got a Neptune Suite with the most beautiful balcony views. Also a gorgeous ship. 

First day of cruising was Hubbard Glacier. Boarded the Catamaran tour and got within a .5 mile of it and let me tell you, extraordinary!! The cruise stayed far away. The tour was worth it. Incredible sunny weather, not a cloud in the sky! 

Second day of cruising was Glacier Bay. Also gorgeous weather without a cloud in the sky. Glaciers are amazing. 

Third day of cruising was Skagway. Hopped in an electric mustang and drove up the Klondike Highway. Stopped at so many spots along the way and hiked off the road a few times to get better views. Carcross was fun. Carcross Desert was cool too. Emerald Lake is gorgeous! Got super warm today. Sunny and no clouds. Picked up fried dough at Klondike Doughboy. 

Fourth day of cruising was Juneau. Rented a car and stopped at the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center. Didn‚Äôt do Nugget Falls, way too crowded. Can‚Äôt see the glacier from there. Drove to Auke Bay for a whale watching tour with Jayleen‚Äôs. Saw a few whales, saw one breach, plenty of tails. Highly recommend smaller boats. The bigger ones scare off the whales and they‚Äôre packed like sardines. Went back into town and had excellent fish tacos at Deckhand Dave‚Äôs. Three of us had 8 tacos, fries, salmon bites, two drinks for $64. Less than spending money for a 1lb of King Crab at Tracy‚Äôs. That‚Äôs the real secret. Stopped at Red Onion Saloon for a Duckfart shot. Super fun!! 

Fifth day of cruising was Ketchikan. This is a neat spot. A lot of shops and oddities. Was tired so didn‚Äôt do much. Went to the Fire Department for a shirt. Went to Dock Street Yard for fish tacos (excellent). Did the Lumberjack show which was fun. Grabbed some chowder from Ketchikan Grab & Go. Loved it. Did some shopping for last minute souvenirs. Walked Creak Street. Saw some salmon jumping (lots of dead ones too). 


Nieuw Amsterdam: Great ship. Didn‚Äôt really do much on it self. Had a Neptune Suite so I was just in the Neptune Lounge or my balcony. Great room and enough space for 3 people. 4 would be too much. It did smell like sewage in the hallways but never in the rooms. MDR food was great and so was Lido. Crows nest had the best coffee. Dive-In has an excellent burger. 

All in all, an incredible vacation that was so worth every dollar spent. This is my advise to everybody, stop doing round trip cruises. Stop getting on big ships because they‚Äôre ‚Äúcooler‚Äù. Do your own land tour. Don‚Äôt do a cruise ships land tour. 

Clothing wise, you absolutely can‚Äôt predict anything. I took everything in between waterproof shoes, rain jackets, long sleeve base layers, hoodies, some shirts. No shorts or bathing suit. I was warm on some days but I made it work. 

Also hesitant on adding this part but get vaccinated :)
Felt sick on day 4 of my land tour. Was worried it would be bad for my cruise but by the time we finished Glacier Bay, I was 100%. I‚Äôm usually a get sick and get knocked out but this is the first year I got Flu/Covid combined vax and felt great quicker.

And then what? Rug, coffee table? Is there enough room for that? What other advice do you have?

I bought a big chair type thing for that corner area.

This guy runs in frantically and tells me he needs to log into his email. (I know I should not have but I was not thinking critically) I realized this was shady once I was told to download a PDF from an email. I said no, it could be malicious. He said it's from the library, so it's safe. I stood my ground, he yelled at me for a minute, called me a liar, swore at me, and tried to pressure me. After he realized I wasn't changing, he started telling me to log out, which I did. He was very impatient, then once I did, he ran away. 

This seems cut and dry, some kind of weird scam, or trying to use MY computer to do something, so he was not tracked? But here is the weird thing. I didnt have his password but did remember his email, so I looked it up. He is a math professor at my college even matched the image. (He seemed to have a really low rating on Rate My Professor BTW) 

I can't think of a good reason for someone making good money at a big shcool to try something like that and risk his career. And he didn't have a phone, or it couldn't wait? Plus all the cursing and pressuring really felt like some kind of scam. 

Any ideas, just people being weird or sounds familiar to anyone? IDK what to think. ",2,1757291025.0,Scams,4,1.0,False

1nb9e65,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tobeused111/comments/1nb9e65/glasses/,Glasses,"These new glasses are simply amazing. I hadn‚Äôt realized how bad my eyes had gotten, or how badly I needed a new prescription, but I can finally see everything again. The flowers on the window sill. The pattern in the marble counter top, which coincidentally could use a better cleaning than it‚Äôs been getting. The fine details on the painting that hangs in the living room. The creepy ghost staring at me from the corner. The magazines piled on the coffee table unread.

The creepy ghost staring at me from the corner?! I take my glasses off for a second, and everything returns to a blurry mess, but if something was standing in the corner I should still be able to somewhat make it out. Not moving my eyes from the corner, I slowly put my glasses back on. Sure enough, she is still in the corner, staring at me. 
Tentatively, before I even have a chance to consider what I‚Äôm doing, my voice creaks out, ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù The ghost moves its head almost imperceptibly, but with my new glasses I could certainly tell that the movement was in response to my involuntary utterance and I had her attention. Damn, these glasses are good.

‚ÄúYes, hello, you there in the corner? I‚Äôm sorry, you there sounds kind of rude but I don‚Äôt really know what to call you, I‚Äôve never spoken to a ghost before.‚Äù The ghost proceeds to look around, obviously as confused as I am at the moment.

 ‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm talking to you. The woman in the corner of my living room. I don‚Äôt mean to be rude, but what are you doing here?‚Äù

She seems to ponder the question while trying to find her voice, like she hasn‚Äôt spoken or been spoken to in so long, she‚Äôs forgotten how. I‚Äôd feel almost sorry for her if I wasn‚Äôt preoccupied being so damn freaked out. I mean, it‚Äôs not every day one gets a life changing pair of glasses only to discover proof of the afterlife looking right at them from the corner of their living room. There really should be some kind  of disclaimer about this sort of thing. The next time I see Dr. Whittaker I‚Äôm going to‚Ä¶

‚ÄúYou see me?‚Äù She replied finally, her voice a mix of beautiful sorrow and pants shitting terror that shook me from my thoughts and made me wish for a moment that I had been born without ears.

""See you. Hear you. All of it. Wait, why didn‚Äôt I ever hear you before, all I did today was get new glasses, my hearing is the same as always?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere has been‚Äù she appeared to think for a second ‚Äú4 other families here since the last time I spoke, and just as many before them that didn‚Äôt hear me, or at least pretended not to hear me.‚Äù Her words becoming more laced with anger as they reached the end of her sentence. 

Eight families before me. This ghost has been here that long, with no one to talk to or acknowledge her existence. Or inexistence. Whatever it is you would call haunting the corner of someone‚Äôs living room. Knowing the previous tenets had rented here for about 5 years, and assuming the others stayed around the same length give or take a year, that‚Äôs 30 to 48 years of being alone.Based on her clothing, that may even be a conservative estimate. 

I can feel myself shifting from my weirdly calm terror, into a slightly frightened and trepidatious form of sympathy. I guess I‚Äôm invested now. ‚ÄúWhy are you here? I mean, not in my living room so much, but just in my house in general?‚Äù

‚ÄúI cannot leave‚Äù, she moaned sullenly. ‚ÄúMy murderer buried my body in the basement, and I cannot leave this place until it is properly laid to rest, and my killer found.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhoa, whoa, whoa, so, you‚Äôre telling me you were murdered, and your bodies been here the whole time? No one ever found you?‚Äù 

The ghost, staring at the floor towards where her feet would be, if they were corporeal and visible, nodded her head sadly without looking up.

‚ÄúAnd your murderer was never caught?‚Äù I asked, my voice showing my obvious annoyance and dissatisfaction for the unfair end my ghostly visitor endured. 

Still staring at the floor, she shook her head again, conveying no with the same sadness. 

‚ÄúWhat a piece of shit.‚Äù I said, which was clearly not what she expected to hear because she quickly looked back to me now, the dark, hollow circles where her eyes would be, if she still possessed them, almost giving the impression that she was crying. Can ghosts cry? I have to snap out of it and stop getting so side tracked. 
‚ÄúNot you, you‚Äôre not a piece of a shit. The guy who did this to you, he‚Äôs definitely a piece of shit. I‚Äôm sorry. Do you know anything about him that might help us find him? Maybe we can call the police and give them the location of some kind of evidence that will get them to arrest him or something? That might work right?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù she murmured, almost a whisper. ‚ÄúI think I missed my chance to move on. No one ever heard me. No one ever found me. He must be long dead like me now.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait a minuet‚Äù I say, holding up a single finger like some Saturday morning cartoon character who just had a light bulb appear over their head, instantly making me feel like a doofus for doing so. I put the finger and hand down and for some reason hope I didn‚Äôt just make a complete fool of myself in front of the ghost. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre trapped here because your body is buried here, then, if he IS dead, maybe he‚Äôs trapped where his body is buried as well.‚Äù 

The ghost continues to stare at me, eerily unmoving, like one of those wind up dolls that you know can move, but only in an unsettling way, and only if someone turns its key. I‚Äôm beginning to think she might think I‚Äôm a little slow, and she‚Äôs rethinking every choice that ever led to her standing in this corner, in my presence, needing my obviously inadequate help. 

‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm saying is, if he IS dead, and if we were able to find his ghost, would it be possible for you to get your closure that way, and move on?‚Äù She seems to perk up at this suggestion, hopefully restoring some of her faith in me not being a complete idiot. I‚Äôm not sure why that should matter to me, but for some reason in this moment, it does. 

‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù She says finally. ‚ÄúMaybe if I can confront him and make him answer for what he has done, my soul can finally rest‚Äù 

‚ÄúOK, so we have the start of a plan yeah?‚Äù I say, mostly to myself. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really not sure what to do next though. I need to think for a minuet.‚Äù 

I cant believe this is happening right now. All I wanted was to come home with my new glasses and catch up on all the shows I‚Äôve missed due to them looking like I was watching them through an inch of cotton balls with my old ones, and relax. Now I‚Äôm playing Nancy Drew with some lost soul, planning to go track down her killer, who‚Äôs potentially also a fuck damn ghost, and God damnit these glasses are too good. Whoever made these should get a raise. But also get fired because it's kind of not cool just giving out glasses willie nilly that make it so you can see the ghosts of people who died before you were in diapers. Especially to someone like me. I‚Äôm barely responsible enough to take the garbage out before the truck is pulling up to my stop every week, I‚Äôm certainly not ready for this pseudo ghost whisperer responsibility. 

I was so lost in my thoughts, I hadn‚Äôt noticed I had sat down on the couch, or that she had moved from the corner and was now standing about two feet from me. I felt like I should feel some kind of abject horror at my current situation but instead I mostly just felt ashamed that I hadn‚Äôt noticed her before today. 

‚ÄúOk, so, I guess first things first, if you‚Äôre stuck here because your body is buried here, and we have to get you from here to where ever he‚Äôs buried, we‚Äôre going to have to dig you up. Well, I mean, I‚Äôm going to have to dig you up, I‚Äôm pretty sure you can‚Äôt hold a shovel, on account of you being a ghost and all.‚Äú 

I looked up from the couch towards her and she continued to stare at me. This close up, my initial feelings of abject terror start to creep back in, if only for the simple fact that staring a ghost straight in its eyeless, unmoving face while you‚Äôre close enough to reach out and touch each other is just something most people never experience in every day life. 

‚ÄúI have a shovel out in the shed, I‚Äôll run out and grab it really quick, then you can show me where to dig I guess.‚Äù I say, as I start to stand up and move past her. As I do, I notice a very significant chill in the air seemingly radiating off of her. I shiver slightly as I walk towards the door, trying to keep her in my eyesight as I do.

Stepping out onto the stone walkway, I wonder to myself, ‚ÄúAm I going crazy?‚Äù as I walk over to my shed to retrieve the shovel. All things considered, I think it‚Äôs a very valid question to ask myself. After all, it does seem statistically more likely that I‚Äôm suffering some sort of mental breakdown, than a supernatural event brought on by prescription eyewear.

I walk into the shed, still pondering my current grasp on reality. As I turn to grab the shovel, I see someone standing by the wall next me, swinging my fist in instinct at my would be assailant while making a noise that‚Äôs half scream, half obscenity.

I have just enough time to register that the person standing in my shed that made me very nearly piss myself, is in fact, my snow suit hanging on the wall. I unfortunately do not have the time, however, to stop my panic fist from connecting solidly with the wall behind it, cursing loudly as I shake my hand like that‚Äôs going to somehow make things better.

I take a moment to try and collect myself before grabbing the shovel, and a pair of heavy gloves off the nearby shelf. Not even going to risk a blister at this point, because it just might be the proverbial straw that breaks the metaphorical camels back, if I‚Äôm not already having some kind of nervous breakdown. I don‚Äôt need that kind of embarrassment on top of everything else.

I slowly make my way back to the house, in no way ready to do any of this, propelled forward begrudgingly by the fact that I‚Äôll likely never be more ready than I am at this moment anyway, so I might as well just get it done. 

I open the door, heading into the kitchen as I look towards the living room, stopping in my tracks. She‚Äôs gone. I stare out into the living room, seeing nothing amiss, and no sign that there ever was a ghostly woman there to being with. I let out an audible sigh, as I set the shovel down. I feel like I should probably be worried, since this means maybe I really am losing it, but the sudden relief I feel at not having to go dig up a body, among other things, trumps that in the moment, as I make my way through the threshold into the living room to sit down.

‚ÄúHello.‚Äù I hear to the right of me, the voice like the icy wind of the saddest Christmas you could ever imagine, making me jump immediately.

‚ÄúJesus fucking shit Christ! Holy fuck!‚Äù I shout, turning in the voices direction while my body visibly recoils, seeing my spectral roommate standing off to the side of the threshold, seemingly having been looking at the cheap painting hanging there when I walked in.
 
Realizing my outburst must have taken her by surprise, I quickly add, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I‚Ä¶thought I must have been hallucinating or something when I didn‚Äôt see you, and then hearing your voice again so close to my ear, nearly made me jump out of my skin. It‚Äôs not you, I promise, I‚Äôm just a naturally anxious kind of person.‚Äù

She continues to stare at me, unmoving, which I choose to take as her acceptance of my explanation as to why I took the Lord‚Äôs name in vain in such a vulgar fashion in reply to her simple greeting. I walk to the couch and sit down, my body practically collapsing into its cushions, the invisible weight of the day seeming to help push me down.

‚ÄúI just...need a minute. To collect my thoughts.‚Äù I say gently, putting my face into my hands as I close my eyes.

‚ÄúWell, at least that means I‚Äôm not crazy.‚Äù I think to myself. Have to just be thankful for the silver lining‚Äôs I guess. Now I just have to go dig up my ghosts dead body, then help her get closure on her murder by tracking down her killer, wherever they are. I‚Äôm really starting to feel like these glasses aren‚Äôt worth all the trouble, regardless of how good they are. Like, when does it end? Am I going to start seeing ghosts everywhere when I‚Äôm wearing them? Dr. Whittaker is definitely getting an earful when I go in for my next appointment.

Realizing I‚Äôm getting side tracked again, and that I‚Äôve been sitting there with my hands over my face for an exorbitant amount of time, I quickly pick my head up, and, seeing the ghostly woman‚Äôs now about a foot away from me, starting at me, I immediately say ‚ÄúHoly hell! You‚Äôve really got to stop sneaking up on me like that, or somebody‚Äôs going to have to find my body as well when I inevitably have a heart attack.‚Äù before letting out a small, uneasy laugh.
 
She tilts her head slightly, regarding me with the empty holes where her eyes should be, which instantly sends a shiver down my spine, as she says ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù Quietly. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok.‚Äù I say gently. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, today‚Äôs just been‚Ä¶a lot. The most excitement I‚Äôve had lately is deciding which microwaved dinner I want to have every night, so I think my brains just frazzled. I‚Äôll be alright. Before we go‚Ä¶dig you up, let‚Äôs see if we can find out where your killer is. Do you know their name?‚Äù I ask, pulling out my phone.

She seems to regard my phone almost quizzically, before saying slowly in a pained voice ‚ÄúGordon‚Ä¶Gordon Howell is the man who murdered me.‚Äù

I begin searching public records databases, trying to find an obituary notice, at first. Finding none, I begin digging deeper, trying to find any mentions of the name nearby, until I see something that makes me audibly gasp.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs‚Ä¶he‚Äôs still alive.‚Äù I say softly. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs currently living in the nursing home downtown.‚Äù

This unexpected turn of events seems to grab her attention immediately, her generally sorrowful demeanor seeming to dissipate, replaced with a no less unsettling aura of vengeful determination. If I had no idea what was going on, and just ran into her for the first time like this, I would probably literally shit my pants on the spot. Hell, I still might.

‚ÄúYou must take me to him.‚Äù She demands firmly, her voice almost pleading in its calm desperation, steeped in a lifetime of denied closure and peace.

‚ÄúOk.‚Äù I say calmly, trying for once not to focus on all the hurdles we still have to jump to get there. ‚ÄúFirst things first I guess. Let‚Äôs go‚Ä¶dig you up.‚Äù I say, steeling myself for the job ahead as I grab my trusty shovel that I never would have guessed in a million years would be used for such a macabre task. 

I open the door to the basement, flicking the light switch as the cement walls and earthen floor below are suddenly bathed in cool florescent light. I begin descending the stairs, my ghostly companion floating down them close behind me, her presence a steady chill against my back.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶um‚Ä¶where is‚Ä¶your body buried?‚Äù my discomfort written in every aspect of my existence as I try not to think too hard about what I‚Äôm asking or what I‚Äôm about to be doing.

I watch as she silently glides towards the middle of the basement, before stopping and pointing down, wordlessly at the dirt below. 

I too remain silent, as I walk over gritting my teeth, and begin to dig in the area she indicated. Shovel full after shovel full, I steadily make a hole in the earthen floor, creating an equal size mound beside me of the dirt displaced as I go. I lose track of time, completely absorbed in the task at hand, when finally my shovel makes contact with something that is definitely not dirt.

Using my gloved hands, I gently remove the loose earth in that area, revealing a skeletal hand, the pointer finger of which my shovel must have broken off, as it lays there alone beside the rest of the bones it spent its entire existence with up till this point.

‚ÄúShit. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù I say, embarrassed that I kind of accidentally desecrated her body.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ok.‚Äù She says slowly, obviously unsure how to feel herself about it. Guess I at least know grave robbing isn‚Äôt my forte. Not that it‚Äôs something I ever even thought about until right this moment anyway.

Suddenly, I‚Äôm hit with an idea, or, at least the beginning of one. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trapped in this house because it‚Äôs where your body is right?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶believe so, yes.‚Äù She says, clearly not seeing where I‚Äôm going with this line of questioning. I take a breath, hoping what I say next makes up for the fact I careless broke her finger off like a dumbass.

‚ÄúI want to try something.‚Äù I say to her, my voice clearly animated, as I genuinely begin to feel excited for the first time since realizing my glasses had the unexpected side effect of allowing me to see fucking ghosts like some kind of bad ass medium, you know, minus the bad ass part. I grab a rag from a nearby shelf, using it to gently wrap up the severed digit. 

‚ÄúCome on‚Äù I say, motioning for her to follow as I begin to ascend the wooden stairs leading back out of the basement. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt go out to my car in the driveway currently, right? I want to bring your finger out there, and see if its enough to allow you to follow me.‚Äù

I go to the kitchen, opening the door separating the house from the world outside and step out onto the stone walkway. I take a few steps forward, before turning around to see if she‚Äôs following me.

I see her standing in the doorway, glancing around at the world outside of what has essentially been her prison all these years, and I can‚Äôt help but feel terrible all over again at this new reminder of how unfair fate has been to her.

‚ÄúHey. Are you ok?‚Äù I ask gently as I walk back to her, her gaze seeming to fix on me as I approach.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶yes, I‚Äôm ok. It‚Äôs just been so long. I had forgotten how big the world is, after spending so long confined in these walls.‚Äù She says, her voice back to that familiar haunting sadness she displayed when we first spoke. I surprise myself, realizing for the first time it no longer makes me uneasy, even in a primal, illogical way.

‚ÄúCome on.‚Äù I say gently. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm right here with you. Let‚Äôs see if this works, so we can finally set things right for you, so you never have to feel trapped or alone like that again, ok?‚Äù

I stand there beside her, as she takes her first tentative step through the doorway, her ethereal form partially outside the house for the first time since she died. I smile at her reassuringly, before saying ‚ÄúSo, what do you say we go pay that asshole who killed you a visit? I have to make one quick stop along the way, but I think I have the perfect plan.‚Äù

She nods ever so slightly, before fully emerging from the place she‚Äôs been trapped in death, longer than she even got to live, rays of the early afternoon sun scattered from a nearby tree branch passing through her, adding an otherworldly beauty to her that almost makes my breath catch in my throat. As she falls in beside me, we walk to the car, as I say ‚Äúok, so, here‚Äôs my idea‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre here to visit with Gordon Howell you said, correct?‚Äù The nurse in reception says to me with a smile, her voice warm and friendly as she types away at the computer in front of her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll be happy, he hasn‚Äôt had a visitor in the two years that he‚Äôs been a resident here. Let me show you the way to his room quick.‚Äù

As she steps from behind her desk, I return her smile, as I say ‚ÄúYeah, Mr. Howell is very closely connected to a dear friend of mine. They go way back. I know they would have wanted me to stop in and check on him, so I came down as soon as I was able.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just going to make his day. His room is just at the end of the hall there. Number 17. I‚Äôll let you go in yourself so the two of you can have some privacy and catch up.‚Äù She says, as she heads back in the direction of her desk, with a small wave.

I turn back towards Gordons room, walking up and knocking on its partially open door, the number 17 emblazoned on it, looking more like a faded prophecy than an identifying numeral the way time has faded and blurred it‚Äôs edges. I poke my head through the opening in the door, saying ‚ÄúMr. Howell?‚Äù

As my eyes take in the room beyond the door, glancing from the sparsely decorated walls containing a calendar and a single mass print painting of a generic still life, the bowl of artistically rendered fruit feeling especially lifeless in their current environment, to a small, uncomfortable looking bed, it‚Äôs sheets and blanket in disarray, until finally landing on a frail looking man in a wheelchair, sitting in front of a small table by the only window in the otherwise barren room.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù Gordon asks me, as he leans forward in his wheelchair, squinting as he tries to figure out who I am.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just the friend of an old acquaintance of yours.‚Äù I say gently. ‚ÄúShe told me for as long as I knew her that you were an important part of her life at one point, and when I heard that you were here this morning, I just knew they would have wanted me to stop by and check on you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see.‚Äù He says, the look of absolute confusion on his face saying that he actually didn‚Äôt see at all. Before he can give voice to any questions he‚Äôs currently warring with in that head of his, I take the opportunity to steer the conversation.

‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm just glad to see you‚Äôre alright. I fear she may have never been at peace, if I was too late to speak with you, and make sure you have everything you need. Speaking of, I couldn‚Äôt help but notice you squinting, when trying to get a look at me. I actually just left my eye doctors office with a spare set of glasses that should be life changing for you. They‚Äôll have you seeing things that you didn‚Äôt even realize were there before you put them on.‚Äù I say, as I hand him the glasses.

He takes the glasses in an unsteady hand, saying ‚ÄúIt would be nice to be able to do my crosswords again.‚Äù More to himself than anything, as he slowly brings the glasses to his face, putting them on as he slowly looks around his room, his eyes wide in wonder at the new visual clarity the eyeglasses have provided. ‚ÄúDamn, these glasses are good.‚Äù He says softly 

‚ÄúRight?! That‚Äôs exactly what I said.‚Äù I say with a laugh. ‚ÄúBut anyway, I should get going for today. I have to go pick up a friend of mine nearby before heading home. You just enjoy those glasses, and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll see you again soon.‚Äù

I step out of the room, turning to give a quick wave goodbye to him, as I see her standing behind him, and I can‚Äôt help but imagine that if she still had eyes in her head instead of those dark voids where they should be, they would burn with the fires and fury of divine retribution. I turn back around and begin to walk out the way I came in. As I reach the nurses desk, the sound of terrified screaming fills the air, coming from the direction of Gordons room. The nurses eyes widen at the sudden cacophony of unintelligible horror down the hall, as she gets up and quickly makes her way towards the commotion.

I make my way outside, walking around the side of the building until I am outside Gordons window. I can here the muffled, panicked voices on the other side as I retrieve the bundled rag containing the skeletal finger that I had placed there before entering, and walk back to my car, my ghostly passenger already waiting inside it.

I open the driver‚Äôs side door, sitting down as I ask ‚ÄúSo, how did it go? I take it from the screaming I heard that he didn‚Äôt exactly embrace your reunion with open arms and apologies.‚Äù I start the car and begin to pull out of the parking lot, heading for home.

‚ÄúI feel‚Ä¶at peace with it. Especially since I got to look him in the eyes one last time after what he did to me. He‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt survive the shock of being confronted by the woman he killed all those years ago. And I was the last thing he saw in this life. I trust true judgement still awaits him in whatever comes next, so that will have to be enough.‚Äù She says calmly, her voice, for the first time since I met her not tinged with any dark or mournful undertones.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I stand in my basement, answering the occasional question as the police forensics team works carefully to extract and remove the body and any evidence linked to her killing, as they‚Äôre all blissfully unaware that the victims spirit is watching them from the stairs, with the kind of bored detachment usually reserved for activities such as watching paint dry, as they slowly but surely gather what is left of her earthly remains.

When we first returned to the house, I put the skeletal finger back where I originally found it, and, instead of trying to finish digging myself, called the police, telling them that in the process of digging to install a sump pump, I had uncovered human remains. They arrived shortly after my call, but if the officer in charges attitude is any indication, they totally don‚Äôt buy the whole sump pump thing, but at this point, I don‚Äôt even care. It‚Äôs not like they can do anything about it, since I wasn‚Äôt even a toddler when the victim was killed. He asked me some standard questions regarding me with the look of someone just wanting to get talking to the weirdo out of the way so he can go home before the crazy can rub off on him too, while the forensic team got to work.

Eventually, once the officer decided he didn‚Äôt need answers as much as he needed to be done getting them from someone he was convinced was up to something shady, but couldn‚Äôt do anything about it, I headed back upstairs to let them finish up without my presence distracting them. I sit down on the couch, watching as my spectral coconspirator floated slowly into the living room not too long after me, coming to a stop about 2 feet from where I was sitting.

‚ÄúEverything ok?‚Äù I ask her quietly.

‚ÄúYes. They are close to finished I think.‚Äù She says, seeming to think for a moment before adding ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt thank you enough, for everything. I finally feel like I can move on, after all those years watching my chances dwindle away as the world moved on and forgot about me. I had honestly given up.‚Äù She says genuinely, as she glides over to sit beside me on the couch.

I recline back in the cushions, saying ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to thank me, I‚Äôm just glad I was able to help. I‚Äôm just sorry it took this long, for someone to finally see you.‚Äù

We sit there like that for a moment, before officer trust issues and the forensics team begin filing out of the basement as they finish, the officer handing me his card warily as he says they‚Äôll be in touch if they need anything else, while the look on his face is saying he just hopes I lose his card and never end up actually using it to contact him about anything ever again. I watch behind him as the last of the forensics team carries her body out of the house, to their vehicle outside, as I walk the still uneasy officer to the door and close it behind him as he leaves.  I turn back to the living room and see her standing in the threshold, looking at me.

‚ÄúIts time for me to go now. Thank you again, for everything.‚Äù She says, the calm and warmth in her voice a stark contrast to the terrifying sorrow of when she first spoke.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome. You know, you never told me your name.‚Äù I say with a small laugh.

She smiles at me for the first time since this all started, and says ‚ÄúCindy Davis.‚Äù

She raises her hand in a small wave, as she fades away, becoming more and more transparent by the second, until she is gone completely, leaving me alone in my kitchen with the events of the day still running through my head. I walk to the fridge and grab a soda, before sitting back on the couch and turning on the TV to finally start catching up on some of the shows I‚Äôm behind on, a small smile tugging at the corner of my lips, glad I was able to at least help set one terrible wrong in this universe right.

As the episode starts, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm seeing everything finally, for the very first time; no more blurriness or anything. These glasses are seriously amazing.

First this grinder was bought on AliExpress in July on a preorder so I got it cheap for around 65‚Ç¨ but it was shipped in the first week of August when it was available.  

I drink 3 types of coffee so I tried all three settings for it. One is for aeropress, espresso and for turkish coffee as it needs the finest size. This is my first manual grinder and I‚Äôm very satisfied with the purchase. If we talk about the packaging, quality and overall product it‚Äôs amazing. Everything was on point and for that price it feels very premium in the hand. Has some good weight to it and the bearing for the handle is smooth. You can easily rotate it on their own. 

For past week mostly I used it to make turkish coffee so it takes a good amount of time to finish with grinding but it‚Äôs a good practice for hands. 

Burr inside is still like new, I always use brush and clean it a bit after grinding. Only once i did full cleaning because i switched the beans to other ones. 

Overall experience is outstanding and really recommend it :) ",2,1757290918.0,Timemore,0,1.0,False

It's 4 in the morning and I feel like I'm losing my goddamn mind.

I've been having the same nightmare every night for exactly five years now. I had hoped the change of scenery might help me get my mind off of everything, but for the past couple of months it's been slowly... deteriorating. Tonight was special. Tonight it was so, so much worse.
Happy Fucking Anniversary.

The most immediate difference from the regular dream is the hardest one to describe. If the original dreams were like sitting alone in a dark, creepy movie theater, these ones had been like having a moldy View-Master fused to my skull. The scene was choppy and stilted, the images in my head looked like they had been covered in bacon grease and deep fried. Everywhere I looked seemed to writhe and twitch as if in agony, and some details kept changing on the peripherals of my vision.

The various cords and tubes almost seemed to be blossoming from the bed, constantly moving and melding together in an ever shifting latticework that seemed to encompass the cramped room. The screens displayed increasingly jumbled messes of numbers and lines, some of the smaller screens skittering around and changing size when I looked away.

Her skin constantly changed color and texture, going from leathery orange to sickly green and all the way back around to deathly pale. Her teeth crowded behind her emaciated lips, moving aggressively past each other like tourists late for their connecting flight, and the number of them kept changing. That I can no longer make out her garbled speech as she claws at an ever larger tumescent, shifting mass of flesh and hairs on her midsection is a blessing these days. This is where the dream usually ends, but tonight my torment had yet to reach its peak.

Suddenly there was a high pitched tone that threatened to split my head in two and the screens started flashing angrily. The cords shuddered and pulsed as distended lumps formed at the edges of the room and traveled down the quivering lines towards the pitiful creature in the bed. Her head slammed backwards into the headboard with a sickening crack as she convulsed in ways that shouldn't be possible for the human body. Her joints constantly shifted positions and angles, and at some points she had more or less than she should.

She sits up suddenly and reaches towards me, her emaciated arms crossing the distance impossibly fast as hordes of spiders with far too many limbs come pouring out of her mouth. Her mouth opens impossibly wide, row upon row of misshapen teeth revealing more of the same. The sounds of scuttling limbs is deafening and I don't even realize I'm awake and screaming until I have to stop to take a breath. The skittering doesn't die out with my voice.

If anything, the maddening scrabble of tiny legs seemed even louder now that I was awake.

I should have known something like this would happen today.

The rumbling, oppressively dark clouds that seemed to hang exclusively over my apartment building were a perfect mirror of my state of mind as I approached the front door. I had considered taking the day off, but the idea of explaining why to my nosy boss seemed too high a mountain to climb today. When I got home, however, I found myself blissfully alone. Ruth seemed to have gotten the message, for now, and Darla seemed to be keeping her own company. Sweet Pea was acting more entitled than usual, I actually had to bring her food bowl into the bathroom since she refused to leave, but she quietly kept to herself in the tub all night.

I stared down at the phone in my hand for a long time. I knew I had to feed myself, but the idea of talking to another person today seemed almost impossible. I relegated myself to raiding the fridge, and when I found the foil wrapped homemade blueberry pie sitting in the back I actually had the gall to think to myself, darkly, *Today must be my lucky day!*

I deserve everything that's happening to me right now.

God only knows what ingredients Ruth might have used, and that was before it had spent weeks at the back of the fridge. I have to admit it was delicious, but before I had even finished I was starting to see things.

I turned to look at a sound I was worried was Ruth unlocking my door, but something made me pause and look back towards the sink. It looked like my favorite mug was sitting precariously on the edge of the counter, the same mug whose shards I had plucked from my heel last night. I rubbed my eyes in disbelief, but when I looked again the counter was bare.

At the time, I thought I was just having a bad day. I always do on this particular day. I thought the guilt over losing the mug had been the straw that broke my back, and I had finally lost my mind. I thought about knocking on Darla's door and seeing if she wanted to wipe out the rest of the day together, hell we could even just go out to the movies. God help me, I even thought about going and talking to Ruth. Just unburdening my soul and dumping all of my woes at her feet.

Ultimately I decided none of it was worth the effort, the quicker I could sleep through the day the quicker it would be tomorrow.

The scuttling, skittering madness was so loud when I woke up I couldn't hear anything else. Clutching my hands tight to my ears to try to drown it out I stumbled towards the door to the bedroom. The moment my hand made contact with the doorknob the scratching cut out, leaving only the agitated grumbling of a looming storm. I don't even hear any of my neighbors through the paper-thin walls.

Stepping into the hallway I strained to hear anything over the sound of my own pounding heartbeat in my ears. I don't remember even turning the TV on today, yet the living room was once again awash in a cold blue glow that only made it seem lonelier, more claustrophobic. The piles of trash and sad, disheveled furniture seemed to be crowding me in, crushing me under the weight of so many nights spent circling the drain. I couldn't put my finger on it but something just seemed wrong, my home for some reason ringing false in my eyes. Unfamiliar. Unwelcoming.

My heart almost leaped straight up into my throat when my eyes locked onto the small ceramic cup sitting on the edge of the sink. It can't be the same mug that had gone down the trash chute before its time, but I don't own any others. The more I stared at it the more sure I was that it couldn't be the same. The handle on this one was a little smaller, and sat a bit too high. The text, which had fooled me on a quick glance, no longer said World's Greatest Dad. It no longer said anything, really, as the strange symbols only bore a passing resemblance to english letters. I had picked it up to get a closer look when suddenly it sprang to life in my hand.

It's hard to describe, but it kind of looked like the mug was a foil balloon that had been suddenly and violently deflated. The smooth, round ceramic slumped into hard edges and sharp points. It very briefly resembles a small, white tumbleweed before the center blossomed into innumerable thin, white needles that sank deep into the fleshy pad of my palm.

My favorite coffee cup had fucking bitten me.

I whipped my arm around reflexively, thankfully before it had gotten a good grip, and I felt a strip of skin tearing off as the little ceramic freak went sailing across the room. The sound it made when it smashed into the wall was absolutely exquisite, sending far more twitching ceramic legs than should have been possible spraying in all directions like a popped boil full of white-gloved fingers. That's when all hell broke loose, just as a flash of lightning from the kitchen window gave me my first good look at the room.

Suddenly, the apartment erupted into life, furniture and piles of trash shifting and twitching as the deafening sounds of tiny scurrying appendages swallowed me whole. The wallpaper almost seemed to be bubbling and popping, until I saw the hundreds of small insects doing a poor job of imitating moldy paint chips. Another couch, just like the one on which I had spent so many nights trying to just fade into oblivion, came crawling out from behind the coffee table, blocking the light from the TV as its cushions parted like a fat bulldog's jowls to reveal hungry rows of gnashing leather-bound teeth. A second coffee table emerged from underneath the first and lurched between me and the front door, seeming to almost grow towards me as one of it's legs split in two and the top morphed into a pentagonal shape.

Backing towards the hallway I grabbed one of the dining room chairs to defend myself, but when my fingers slip into the pattern carved in the back the holes suddenly constricted, burying rough wooden needles into my fingers from all angles. Gritting my teeth so hard I tasted blood, I hoisted the chair-thing above my head and savagely smashed it against the table, sending strangely soft chunks of twitching wood and particle board flying.

Whatever fleeting moment of hope I felt at my barbaric victory against the dining room set was swiftly dashed when the couch took its place at the entrance to the hallway. I was considering an escape through the bedroom, the window slats should open just wide enough to squeeze out, when I heard a mournful cry from behind me.

Sweet Pea was still in the bathroom.

No time to think, I immediately went charging around the corner and came to a stop so hard I could swear I slid a little on the floor. I didn't even notice at first that the bathroom door was closed. I finally saw the source of the flood of tiny insect-like things infesting my apartment. The closet door was open again. A small, unremarkable cardboard box lay across the threshold, upturned slightly as a writhing mass of old clothes that should have been donated or thrown away years ago spilled out into the hallway. The permanent marker scrawl on the side was mostly legible, and it almost spelled her name correctly.

I realize I've stepped back into the corner of the hallway when I hear the couch redouble it's efforts to reach me. Turning my head to look I see it stuffing itself into the hallway, bulging and morphing as it slowly oozes down the hallway. I find myself frozen staring at it as hundreds of tiny, square couch legs sprout from its sides and dig deep into the plaster of the walls. The frantic scraping of the couch's thick wooden legs is deeper than the low buzz of scrabbling legs from before, more urgent and powerful, as it desperately dragged itself towards me.

I definitely won't be getting out through the bedroom.

Sweet Pea let out another small, muffled cry and I don't even realize I'm moving until I feel the impact of the box against my foot and the cool metal of the knob mixed with a burning itch in my palm as I slam the closet door shut. The pile of clothes crushed under the door squealed in a chorus of pain and rippled as dozens of fabric fingers shot out, tapping frantically on the floor like a piano concerto.

Dazed, I looked down at my hand to see a large wooden splinter with three joints sprouting from my palm, twitching and writhing like a severed roach leg or lizard tail. Without stopping to think about it I ripped it out with my teeth and spat the wriggling hunk of wood to the floor, wrenching my foot away from the gradually slowing fabric appendages as I closed the distance to the bathroom. The moment I opened the bathroom door Sweet Pea bolted between my legs and through the closet door that had reopened behind me when I wasn't looking. Before I could even think of giving chase the bulky, misshapen form of the couch came lumbering around the corner and I swiftly locked myself in the bathroom.

That's where I've been for the past half an hour or so while the thunderous pounding of rain intensifies against the window, typing this up with bloody toilet paper wrapped around my arm while a couch tries to fit through a quarter-inch thick gap between the door and the floor. The worst part is, it's starting to get somewhere. The old lady who lives next door might have drugged me, and that was the best case scenario. A part of me is sure this is just a bad dream, a terrible reaction to the wrong kind of ""special"" dessert from an out of touch old bat who probably meant well. A bigger part of me wants to accept it, to just sit here and wait while my sad, empty apartment gets sadder and emptier, to let the couch swallow me whole. Something stronger rising from the deepest depths of my soul can still hear Sweet Pea calling from down the hall, and thinks the heavy porcelain toilet tank lid could probably do a lot more damage than a wooden chair. Ruth's going to be pissed, she just installed it last week.

If I don't make it... shit, I don't know. I have nothing to give and nobody to give it to. Just take my advice. Go wash your damn dishes. Go hug your loved ones. Go tell her you're sorry.

For the past hour or so I've been laying in bed trying to ignore the soft, frantic scrabbling of tiny claws with an occasional thump mixed in. These noises are a little easier to ignore than the muffled sobbing coming through the wall from the apartment next door. God, I hope that's not because of me.

Sweet Pea has never been the most energetic cat. She's usually curled up in front of the hall closet napping, when she isn't giving me judgmental stares from around a doorway. I don't know how such a small creature can be so haughty, somehow looking down a nose only four inches from the floor. She didn't even run around the place when we first moved in a couple of months ago. Something must have happened to her today, and I think I might know what it was.

Earlier today when I had just gotten home from work I found the door unlocked. Inside I found a diminutive older woman who appeared to be dressed as a rodeo clown's lawyer crouching down over Sweet Pea with a small plastic bag of handmade treats. I'm sure to most people something like that might be shocking, an event that joins the reliable old party stories like ""The time I thought my dog was a pile of laundry"" for decades to come, but for me it was just Thursday. My landlord Ruth has a little issue with boundaries. 

She's the kind of woman who, in theory, might be lovely to be around in tiny doses. She brings over trays of delicious homemade pastries and cookies that always seem to disappear faster than you think should be possible. She listens to you talk with eyes open wide, bulging behind her thick rhinestone rimmed glasses, heart open even wider.

But it was the third time this week I had come home to find her in my apartment. The third time this week a surprise social interaction was sprung on me when all I wanted to do was kick off my Customer Service Voice at the door and not think about how one day a robot will be able talk to people better than I do.

""Goddamnit Ruth, why are you here when I'm not?""

She jolted upright with a cry like an extinct bird's mating call, knocking the single dining room chair over with her prodigious backside. Sweet Pea tore out of the kitchen like her ass was on fire, bringing down a tower of old pizza boxes in an uncontrolled demolition. Ruth sheepishly kicked a couple of pizza bones into a pile and swiped surprisingly steady hands down the front of her neon fuchsia pantsuit as she hit me with the full force of her $50,000 smile. The cacophonous rattling of her many plastic arm bangles was drowned out by her voice, as soft as a buzzsaw and twice as loud.

""Oh darling I thought I would just poke my head in and tidy up a tad, and then I couldn't just not say hello to Sweet Pea! Oh isn't she just a darling you know I had one just like her except he only had three legs, this was way back in, oh, yes I think it was-""

""You can't keep coming in here when I'm not home, Ruth.""

""Well why not? It's my gosh darn building! I'm here offering my services at no extra charge, to boot! I cook, I clean, I'm pretty nifty with a screwdriver and hammer, I can conversate with the best of 'em! Heck, just the other day-""

""It's against the law?""

""The law!"" She threw her head back and cackled deeply, lime green fingernails clutching at her midsection as she leaned back against the sink. ""Well according to Johnny Law you're just a friend who stays over a lot and helps with the light bill sometimes! I know you don't mean it anyhow, you know if you tell me to get out I'll just up and skedaddle! Come on now Jack, I'm just trying to make a connection. You like me, dont you, Jack? I just want to help my tenants, what's so gosh darn bad about that? Look, the sink is absolutely crawling with ants, this place could sure as heckfire use a woman's touch every now and then!""

I stormed over to the faucet and opened the hot water handle full blast, swiftly and decisively washing the horde of tiny, squirming bugs down the drain. In a way, I felt bad for them. They were just living their little lives, oblivious that in an instant I would decide to wash it all away. Ruth was silent as I enacted my ant genocide and when I turned around afterwards she wore a strange expression I couldn't place on her pinched, leathery face. I thought I was being a bit harsh at the time, but sometimes you kind of have to be to get your damn alone time.

""There, no more ants. No more ants, no more Ruth. Get the fuck out. Please.""

If I had hurt her feelings she recovered quickly, once again blinding me with a smile far too big for her face. Getting hit with that at point blank is like realizing the light at the end of the tunnel is the reflection of your flashlight on a sleek metal cowcatcher bearing down on you.

""I can tell you're having a tough day darling so I'll get out of your hair, the last thing I want is you closing yourself off to me like some of the other tenants. I'll be back another time when you're ready to grab a bag and a broom! Please give Sweet Pea my love, and tell her she's the prettiest most-"" 

Sometimes you have to end her sentences for her so I cut her off there with a winning smile of my own, one forged through many years of serving the public. For maximum effect I squinted my eyes the same way she did. Most people subconsciously enjoy being mirrored, it makes them feel like they're not alone. 

""Okay, thanks Ruth, bye!"" I shouted as I shooed her away from the door and finally she began trundling her way to the elevator. Her thick, square heels portend her looming approach and I pictured the townspeople shuttering their shades in fear that she may darken their doorstep.

Before I could flee to the safety of my nest I turned around to see my neighbor from the other side of the apartment, Darla. Though she had a smirk on her mousey face and a bottle of whiskey in her hands I could also see that her little black tee shirt was inside out and her mascara was running.

""Hey Jagoff. I see you just survived Hurricane Ruth, wanna forget your troubles?"" 

She tilted her head and looked up at me with bright blue eyes that were swimming as her chipped nails played a beat on the glass bottle. I knew that turning her down would just have her crying and throwing things at the wall all night and I was so tired I almost did anyways. I figured with any luck, she would be passed out on the couch in twenty minutes and I could finally get to relaxing.

Today is just not my lucky day.

If she had any comments about the state of my apartment she mercifully kept them to herself, collapsing into the couch like a crumbling ruin as she eagerly unscrewed the bottle. We didn't talk much, thankfully, merely passing the bottle back and forth as we stared blankly at the flickering glow of the TV. Something was clearly bothering her but she didn't want to say, and I didn't want to ask. In a way, it was nice to let all of my thoughts slide out of my head like a cracked egg and just exist.

Eventually, the bottle ran dry. Then the unopened bottle of rum I had stashed in the back of the cabinet ran dry, too. I don't remember what we said as she stumbled out the door. As my hand fell from the knob and I turned around I thought I saw her keyring sitting on the coffee table.

In retrospect, perhaps the way I threw open the door was a bit dramatic, but whatever I had been planning to say was shocked out of me when I saw Darla was still standing there. I turned to look inside to restart my train of thought but the bare top of the table gave me nothing. In hindsight, I had probably been looking at a giant cockroach with my bleary eyes the first time. When I turned back to look at her my swimming mind once again struggled to convey anything. It's supposed to be my job to communicate with people, it was downright shameful.

Whatever I had been trying to communicate, she got a different signal. I won't bore you with the details, for my sake more than yours. The only pertinent ones are that it was unfortunately short, I'm a bit out of practice it seems, and that she was never out of my sight the whole time. Well, we both had our eyes closed for most of it, but you get what I mean. She was probably thinking of someone else, too.

When we were finished I made the worst mistake of all, I tried to be funny.

""Hey, try not to forget your keys this time.""

I think I was setting up some lame pun but I never got that far. She burst into tears and immediately started grabbing her clothes, turning her face away as I tried to explain.

""No, wait, I wasn't saying you should leave. I just-""

She cut me off with a harsh hand gesture, still facing away. Her reply came in a warbling, artificially cheery voice.

""No, no, I know that. I just suddenly remembered s-something and I have to go check on it right now.""

She sniffled loudly and pulled her clothes on with jerky motions, slowly making her way towards the door. Just before she walked out she turned and did her level best at a smile that looked like a chalk sidewalk drawing in a downpour.

""This was... um... nice. Maybe we can hang another time. Sorry I made it so weird.""

She was out the door before I could correct her, and it wasn't a full minute before I heard her softly crying through the wall.

It was getting pretty late by that point so I filled up Sweet Pea's bowl, only briefly stopping to note that she hadn't immediately come sauntering up to judge me through half-lidded eyes, and headed to bed. I should have probably checked her litter box but I was exhausted, and had a pretty good idea that Ruth had made it her first stop.

I haven't seen Sweet Pea all night since I caught Ruth feeding her homemade treats.

Suddenly, a blood curdling scream echoes through the wall, followed by several impacts of smashing glass. I it up motionless in bed for long seconds, struggling to listen for any signs of life over the maddening scrabbling coming from my kitchen. My heart races a mile a minute as I slowly climb out of bed, taking a step towards the wall I shared with Darla. I almost jump clear out of my skin when a crashing sound rings out from my kitchen.

Sweet Pea must have knocked over a mug.

I cross the distance to the wall swiftly, leaving behind a string of mumbled curses I'd rather not repeat here. I press my ear to the wall to listen for signs of life from next door but that only seems to amplify the frantic scratching sounds, the wall somehow picking up the vibrations. Eventually I hear the sobbing pick up again and I breathe a sigh of relief. I'm not going to say she's okay, but at least she's alive over there.

The door to my bedroom makes a soft clicking noise when I turn the handle and the scratching sounds immediately stop. Swallowing hard I open the door and slowly step into the silent stillness. I had forgotten to turn the TV off and the input screen bathes the room in a cool blue, casting harsh shadows across discarded cardboard and half empty plastic bags. The room is as still as you always hope a grave will be.

The compressor in the AC kicks on and a small styrofoam cup clatters to the floor, making my eyes dart to the sink. On the floor below the tiny white cup lazily rolls back and forth in a small field of shiny ceramic shards. The air from the vent must have knocked over the styrofoam, but the mug?

Sweet Pea knows better than to run around on the counter.

I'm tempted to leave the mess for later but I know I'll be stepping in it when I make my morning coffee, plus it could be dangerous to the eight pound cat that lives in the bottom half-foot of my apartment.

I was walking past the sink to grab the broom when I heard the light creak of a stealthy step on a loose laminate floor tile. When I turn to look I see a dark shape dart out of view under the couch and instinctively take a step back, holding in a scream by biting my lip almost as deep as the shards of my favorite mug bite into my heel. The mess can wait, I need to get ahold of that goddamned cat before she gives me a heart attack.

I want to go pluck the broken chunks of ceramic in the bathroom but for some reason I can't bring myself to walk past the sofa.

""Sweet Pea? Come on girl, come out.""

I feel stupid calling to her like that, especially as the silence that answered hangs heavily in the air. She's as likely to come when I call as she is to climb up onto my lap, we just don't have that kind of relationship. I hoped that at least she would move or something, give me some indication that she was alive.

Anxiety digs it's long fingers deep into the back of my skull and squeezes my mind tight as I struggle to dismiss the dark thoughts hemming me in. She's just acting weird. Maybe she caught that roach I saw earlier and doesn't want to talk with her mouth full. Maybe the mug had landed on her head and she lay dying under the couch right now, grey sludge trickling down the sides of her tiny face as she watches what's supposed to be her caretaker tremble in fear and do nothing.

I take a deep breath in to calm my nerves, and almost immediately I can feel the grip of anxiety loosen. Being careful not to bump the shrapnel in my heel I slowly lower myself to the floor to peer underneath the couch. I should have turned on the light, it's pitch black under there and cluttered with old plastic wrappers and long lost socks. 

Jesus, I need to clean up a bit sometime. I know it's been getting bad, I know I have to clean it up at some point, but I just never seem to have the energy. Putting on the Fake Smile Voice all day to deal with entitled rich assholes is exhausting, by the time I get home I just want to sink into the sofa and forget about the day.

Crawling towards the couch on my hands and knees I think I see movement so I lean down and stick my arm under, turning my face away to reach further towards the back. As my fingers probe into dusty cobwebs and forgotten pieces of discarded food I think I hear a rustle and call out to her again.

""Getting real tired of this, Pea."" 

She responds with a soft growling whine, somehow coming from in front of me. I turn my head and see her tense body crouched in the darkness under the coffee table. Did she sneak around behind me when I was bending down to reach under the couch?

Before I can react she thunders past my face like a woolly freight train, scattering trash and stray hairs like a smoke bomb. She streaks down the hall and around the corner, yowling and hissing the whole way. I hear her collide with a door as I shoot to my feet, ignoring the searing pain in my heel to sprint after her as the sounds of her own struggle intensify. I round the corner to the sound of a dull thud that precludes a heavy silence and come to a sudden halt.

The door to the hall closet is open.

I don't know how long I was standing there but the thought of Sweet Pea laying on the floor with a broken neck, an accusatory glare with vacant eyes, snaps me out of it and I step into the threshold. The closet looks just as I remember with one small difference. A small cardboard box has fallen off of the shelf and lay slanted in the corner. The side that was labelled is facing away but I don't need to see it to know which box it is. 

I don't even realize I've been slowly backing away until a shard of ceramic embedded in my heel makes contact with the baseboard in the hallway, sending a bright bolt of pain up my spine that snaps me out of my daze. I realize now that the perfect silence has been broken as a low growl emanates from just underneath me.

I can't begin to describe the relief I feel when I look down and see Sweet Pea hunched at my feet staring into the darkness of the hall closet. I swiftly close the closet door and bend down to pick her up, wincing as the pain in my leg begins to really make itself at home. Surprisingly she doesn't complain as I escort her to the bathroom for first aid.

I'm not a Vet but as far as I can tell she has no injuries, save for one small patch of fur missing on her flank. I assume that's from running into the closet door so hard it popped open. Her eyes are clear and alert, and she hasn't had any more episodes the whole time I was pulling shards of coffee cup out of my foot. My best guess is she had a reaction to something in the treat Ruth fed her earlier, God only knows what the hell it's made of, and it seems to have worn off. If I see any other strange behaviors tomorrow I'll get her looked at but for now I'm eager to put this night behind me. On the way out of the bathroom I pause at the hall closet and, without turning to look, gently turn the small lock on the handle.

Maybe Sweet Pea can sleep in my bedroom tonight, just this once.

My wife is 36 years old, 5‚Äô6‚Äù, and she currently weighs about 112 lbs. After the birth of our 3 kids she weighed around 139 lbs and always looked healthy and thin, with some natural fluctuations.

Over the last month and a half, she has lost a lot of weight. She seems weak, has been losing an alarming amount of hair, and sometimes faints for a few seconds. She refuses to let me call an ambulance when this happens.

She insists that she‚Äôs fine, tells me she has seen a doctor (though I‚Äôm not convinced she has), and says the doctor wasn‚Äôt concerned. She also denies any possibility of anorexia, saying she‚Äôs ‚Äònot a teenager‚Äô and just ‚Äúin shape.‚Äù

But her eating habits worry me. She technically eats everything, but in very small quantities. For example, yesterday she had a few sips of a smoothie and 4 coffees for breakfast, 3 fries (yes, litterally 3) and a bite of our daughter‚Äôs burger for lunch, and then skipped dinner because she ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt hungry.‚Äù This has become the pattern nearly every day.

I feel helpless and heartbroken. She doesn‚Äôt want me to intervene, but I‚Äôm very concerned for her health.
	‚Ä¢	Should I be worried that this is dangerous?
	‚Ä¢	Is there anything I can do at home (like adding sugar behind her back in her smoothies) to help her get more calories?
	‚Ä¢	At what point should I insist on her seeing a doctor or going to the ER, even against her wishes?

1nb9akr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1nb9akr/absolutely_disappointing_ordering_and_costumer/,Absolutely disappointing ordering and costumer service experience with Nespresso,"What happened in the past 24 hours has completely changed my view of Nespresso. I‚Äôve been a loyal customer since 2019, own both an Original and a Vertuo machine, and have consistently purchased Nespresso coffee. Last night, I placed a large order of 25 Original capsules to restock, partly because of the advertised promotion: a free capsule display and a mug with the purchase of 25 capsules. I entered the code correctly and confirmed the promotional items were in my cart before checkout. However, after I paid, the items disappeared from my order history.

This has never happened before, so I immediately contacted customer service. Since it was my first time, I didn‚Äôt realize I could call 24/7, so I left a message through the website chat. No one responded before I went to bed. When I checked in the morning, the first specialist simply asked if I had ordered 25 Original capsules‚Äîsomething I had already made clear‚Äîand then closed the chat without helping.

I then spent an hour with another specialist, who finally explained that the promotional items were actually out of stock. This was never disclosed on the website, and the promotion was still being advertised while I spoke to them. That feels like bait-and-switch advertising‚Äîencouraging customers to place large orders for items that don‚Äôt exist.

I requested to cancel my order, and the specialist told me a refund request had been submitted and should appear within 30 days. However, when I asked for confirmation that the order was canceled, I was told the order had already shipped (!), and the shipment team would *attempt* to return it.

I‚Äôm left completely uncertain: Has my order truly been canceled? Will my refund actually be processed? Do I need to pick up the package myself, or will UPS or the shipment team return it automatically?

Why does Nespresso make it so difficult for customers to cancel an order? Why continue advertising a promotion when the items are out of stock? Why is customer service unhelpful‚Äîor unwilling‚Äîto resolve such a simple issue?

As a loyal customer of many years, this has been extremely disappointing.",2,1757290650.0,nespresso,4,0.6,False

Ever felt that rush when you create something with AI? That little spark of joy when it all comes together? What if I told you that you could transform that hobby into some serious **passive income**? Oh, and by the way, the deadline's ticking! ‚è∞

Now, before you roll your eyes and think, ""Yeah, right!"" hear me out. A lot of us are just dabbling in the world of AI, but with a little creativity (and maybe a bit of elbow grease), you can turn those cool projects into cash! 

Here‚Äôs how to get started:

**1. Monetize Your Skills**
   - Got a flair for writing? Try **AI content generation** services. Sell your unique AI-generated articles or stories.
   - Love designing? Create and sell **AI-generated art**. Websites like Etsy are gold mines for creative folks.
   - Passionate about voiceovers? Dive into **text-to-speech** services where your AI-driven voice can narrate audiobooks.

**2. Build a Niche Community**
   - Start a blog or YouTube channel dedicated to your AI hobby. Share tips, tricks, or tutorials!
   - Don‚Äôt forget affiliate marketing. Recommending tools you love? Ka-ching! üí∞

**3. Create and Sell Digital Products**
   - Think online courses or eBooks. Use your knowledge to teach others how to harness the power of AI.
   - AI-generated templates for social media posts, resumes, or even website designs‚Äîlots of folks are willing to pay for that convenience.

**4. Engage in Freelancing**
   - Websites like Upwork or Fiverr are bustling with people looking for AI-related gigs. Whether it's writing or graphic design, put out your services and watch the magic happen! ‚ú®

**5. Keep It Passive**
   - Once you set up a product or service, sit back and watch it flow. It takes time, but with the right approach, you could be raking in the dough while binge-watching your favorite series!

So, what's the catch? **The deadline's ticking:** AI is evolving fast, and the sooner you jump on board, the better your chances of carving out your niche in the passive income landscape. 

Imagine yourself in a few months, sipping coffee, checking your sales while the AI does the heavy lifting. Sounds like a dream, right? 

And hey, even if you're not making bank just yet, every little step counts. Maybe share your current projects? Or discuss how you're thinking of taking that leap? The floor's open, and I can't wait to hear your thoughts! üôåüí¨",1,1757290464.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **""Chiba Lotte Marines vs. Orix Buffaloes: A Game Where the Odds Are as Boring as a Rain Delay""**

The NPB clash between the **Orix Buffaloes** (1.56 moneyline odds) and **Chiba Lotte Marines** (2.25 moneyline odds) on September 8, 2025, is shaping up to be a statistical snoozefest‚Äîunless you *love* parsing decimal odds like a spreadsheet enthusiast. Let‚Äôs break it down with the precision of a relief pitcher timing his warm-up throws.

### The Moneyline: Orix is the ""Safe"" Bet, But Safe is Boring

* **Orix Buffaloes**: Implied probability of **64.1%** (1 / 1.56). They‚Äôre the bookmakers‚Äô favorite, probably because their name sounds like a corporate team that never takes risks.
* **Chiba Lotte Marines**: Implied probability of **44.4%** (1 / 2.25). They‚Äôre the underdog, but if you‚Äôre betting on them, you‚Äôre essentially saying, ‚ÄúI trust this team more than the oddsmaker‚Äôs coffee-fueled spreadsheet.‚Äù

### The Spread: Chiba Needs to Outscore Orix by 1.5 Runs‚Ä¶ Or Just Win

* **Chiba -1.5** (odds: \~1.65, implying 60.6% implied probability).
* **Orix +1.5** (odds: \~2.0, implying 50% implied probability).  
Translation: Chiba has to win by *more than a run and a half*, which is just a fancy way of saying ‚Äúwin decisively or go home.‚Äù

### **Totals: 7.5 Runs‚ÄîBecause Half a Run is Just a Pitcher‚Äôs

Inside was what looked to me like an old coffee maker, some small coffee cups, two thimbles, and some plastic cutlery.

The case has P.B. stamped just below the latch. I originally thought this meant Poetry Barn but once I got it opened I saw a metal tag that said Rexbilt so maybe stamp was just someone's initials. 

The plastic cutlery has flower patterns on it and stamped just below it says Androck. The thimbles only have made in Germany on them.

The coffee maker and cups have no identification markings. All around a interesting find in my opinion! Any help identifying this stuff would be greatly appreciated.",1,1757290152.0,Antiques,1,0.67,False

I (24nb) went no-contact with my father 5 years ago. I did so because after 3 years of trying to explain to him that his behavior towards me was extremely toxic (hate that word, but it's accurate) and that things needed to change, he still wouldn't take any accountability and stop constantly playing the victim when he wasn't. A few family members from that side of the family, like my stepmother and grandparents reached out and they completely took his side and told me that just because he wasn't very nice to me, doesn't mean he's not family. So, I pretty much assumed that I lost that entire side of the family.

Fast forward to this year. I've been getting a lot of treatment for my physical and mental health issues. Honestly, I'm doing really good in my recovery. I've built a really good life for myself. But, there was a part of me that wondered about my dad and if he was any different. I saw that he was being a grandfather and that maybe he learned how to not be awful to the grandkids like he was to me. I sat on those thoughts for a few months to see if I actually wanted to reach out to him or if I was just being unreasonably hopeful.

After completing a new type of therapy that taught me a lot about myself and gave me so many new tools to help me deal with life, I really took a look at what I wanted. I decided that I wanted to know if my dad had taken any time to reflect of not having me in his life and if he would actually be willing to make changes so that we could have a healthy relationship. But, I had to make sure I could handle the very real possibility of him being the same guy he was a few years ago. So, I took some time to prepare myself.

At the end of July, I reached out to him. He expressed that he missed me every day and wanted me back in his life, but that he really didn't know why I left in the first place. (That was surprising to me since I explained it to me for 3 years until I eventually gave up and cut him out.) So, I explained it to him once more, but with much better communication skills. I explained that he basically used his religion and upbringing to be a terrible person. Genuinely, he did and said some awful stuff.

Like...
He was the type of parent that was super critical of me but never looked in the mirror. He was physically abusive with my mum and his other ex-wife, and repeatedly cheated on pretty much every girl he was with, including his current wife. He was very controlling and misogynistic towards me (afab) and the women me was with. Honestly, very much falls into the man-child category that wants a mom instead of a wife. He made it very clear that no child of his was ever going to be queer, except we all knew I was the fruitiest fruit to ever fruit. He constantly criticized my interests, my appearance, and my abilities even when I was trying to be exactly what he wanted. Nothing I did was ever enough for him. He especially didn't like when I stood up for myself or others and he was constantly shit-talking everyone. He was the adult version of a school bully. He talked about how he had no friends, but then never took a minute to ask why.

After I calmly explained to him once more why I cut him out, he broke down crying. (He never cries.) He told me how hurt he was that he didn't have me in his life anymore and that he would make the effort to change. Things like calling me by my actual name and using they/them pronouns. I told him that I was going to set boundaries and hold him to them and he agreed to start fresh and get to know each other like strangers. I was surprised, but happy with that outcome. So, we planned a coffee date.

Unfortunately, his work caused issues and we had to reschedule our coffee date. At the beginning of August, he told me he would let me know his work schedule when he got it. A month went by and I heard nothing. I realized that maybe he didn't miss me like he said be did. Maybe I fell for his lies again. So, after a month of silence, I decided I was done. I sent him a voice memo explaining that I didn't want him to contact me ever again and that he blew his chance. I thought that be the end of it, but I was wrong...

A few days later, my stepmother sent me a message. She explained that she had a better understanding of why I left and that my dad was in the wrong for not contacting me. She also expressed that they were having money issues and that's why my dad hadn't rescheduled. (He would have to pay for the gas money to come see me and it's a 1.5 hour drive.) She expressed that the family missed me and even my step-niece wanted to meet me, even though she technically already has, she just doesn't remember since she was only a toddler when I saw her last. (And I'll be honest, it absolutely broke my heart because I miss my step-siblings and their kids so much. I still think about them all the time, wishing I had kept in touch with them. I honestly just assumed they were better off because I would bring drama because of my dad and stepmother, and I didn't know how to navigate things on my own. Honestly, still don't.) She told me that both her and my father didn't realize he was on a time limit and that he still wants to meet with me. She told me that she would love me no matter what I choose, but that she hopes I have one last chance (for my dad) in me.

After reading her messages, I just cried. I genuinely don't know what to do. I don't want to let my father get away with hurting me anymore and I want to hold my ground where it matters most. I don't want to be chasing him. I want him to do something good when the ball is in his court. But, I want to say that he can have one last chance. I want a good dad and I don't want to cut him out if he's actually willing to work on things.

1nb92gq,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1nb92gq/hibrew_machines_good_enough_150/,Hibrew Machines good enough? [150‚Ç¨],"Hi there. A few months back, my brother got into the coffee hobby. He wasnt settled on a brewing method a few months prior, so I got him a sage smart grinder as a birthday present, which he loves. Now after staying at my place for a week and living the lavish livestyle of mine (joke), he wants to get his first espresso machine. 

Thing is, he is really pinched on money, since he is a student and refuses to take more money from me, which i can understand but well... Makes the search way harder.

Some preferrences:

-Quick heat up time. - My ascaso has a thermoblock in it, and he was kinda floored, when I told him how long a ""normal"" machine needs to heat up. He has a pretty active Lifestyle, making 10min heatup times a no go. The Bambino plus while out of range would be perfect for him. 

-longevity - he doesnt wanna buy a new machine until he can afford a better one, which is after he graduates from University, this means 2 years minimum.

-Steam Wand - he likes milk drinks, since I know those tube ones handle like garb, i want him to have some steam wand that isnt a paranello or how those are called and i dont wanna try to replace the wand, even if its easy, i would love, if the default one is a good one. 

-non pressurized Portafilter compatibility - well, that's a thing with budget machines, dual walled filters. His grinder can espresso so he can use the proper espresso stuff. 

He found a brand of machines called Hibrew, which Look really good on paper, exept for the missing solenoids, but aside from that it looks good. Since i only have bad experiences with cheap machines (but with the ones from a few years back, looking at you, gastroback), I am kinda hesitant to give him the go to buy this machine. What do you think, can i tell him to get the thing or will he find himself brewing cezves again after a few months with this pile of plastic? Which machine would you recomend at a price point of around 150‚Ç¨?

I'm in my 30s and I work in academia 5 days a week in the office. When I have downtime, I'm working out, hanging out with friends outside the apartment, and reading and writing. I'm an ambivert and I'm a big literature and performing arts person. We don't have to become friends but very cool if we do or just go for drinks or watch a film from time to time.

Move-in date: from December 6 on. Seeking someone to commit to a one-year lease.

Your Room:

\- 10' x 12"" with a giant walk-in closet and half of another one by the bathroom.

\- unfurnished except for AC. I could give you my clothing racks if you like, though.

\- Natural light throughout the day all year around because we're high up with beautiful views.

The Apartment:

\- Huge living and dining room - 12' x 20' - my current housemate is taking her TV so feel free to bring yours. Otherwise, it's already furnished (though I'll likely get better and more chairs).

\- Kitchen with dishwasher and appliances

\- Bathroom includes a tub

\- Laundry on the ground floor - it's quite affordable\~

In addition, Stuyvesant Town complex has:

\- 24/7 Security

You're welcome to bring a dog or cat or any other small animal you have. I prefer finding a woman for the room, but the right kind of guy would do too. I'm not opposed to couples if we're a good match, but the rent would be higher for two people.

1nb8x7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/firsttimemom/comments/1nb8x7o/mil_66f_flew_back_to_her_country_after_spending_2/,MIL (66F) flew back to her country after spending 2 weeks with us. I (33F) am feeling defeated and heartbroken.,"Context: My MIL (66F) visited us for 2 weeks with her husband to meet her grand daughter for the first time. Myself 33F, husband 33M and baby 6 months. We are first time parents, keep this in mind. 

We were looking forward to this trip and now that it's over it has felt me feeling defeated. I hoped that MIL and I could form a meaningful connection, that I could get to know her deeper as she lives overseas. I hoped for a stronger bond with her now that I'm a mother myself.

I got to know her a little bit more as I asked her about her childhood here and there when given the chance however the majority of her stay I didn't feel love nor safe around her. She had a judging aura and made constant comments about how I did things. 

She would stop me from tending to my crying baby. For example my baby cried in the car seat which she normally does, when this happens we normally pull over when safe, take her out and have a short break. (disclaimer I checked with her pediatrian and a pediatric chiro they said some babies just hate carseats). 
But one time baby cried and cried and MIL said do not take the baby out because she knows I will remove her. So then baby cried and cried and I was so upset because I couldn't tend to my baby. (BTW give me some grace I know I can just do what I want but keep in mind I'm a First time mom, I'm Post partum and I'm being told what to do and idk how to act) 
This happened again another time. My baby cried and was looking at me, I wanted to pick her up but keeping in mind what my MIL said last time I was caught I didn't know what to do. Until the cries became hysterical, my daughter was so stressed. She never cries like that. I was getting stressed. I told my husband to take the nearest exit which he didn't. When he finally stopped MIL and her husband got out of the car and walked away. My daughter had pooped herself allover her back, she was crying so much, she does this when she is stressed. I hugged her and we were crying together. He and I got into a back and forth in the car. Voices raised. We were bickering, I was crying because I wasn't used to baby being so stressed and baby was hysterical. It was just a stressful situation all around. (my husband isn't an ass ok so no comments about that it was rush hour he said he was also stressed). 
So then MIL was upset at me because she said I blamed my husband (her son) because he didn't pullover like I asked. So she ignored me for the rest of the afternoon. Even at night she ignored me didn't say goodnight and didn't make a pot of coffee or eggs in the morning like she used to (showing me attitude basically). I don't really care for this but it shows her nature. 

Now on the other hand, I'm trying to understand her in the best of my abilities. I'm trying to understand why she would do certain things and act a certain way. A lot of what people do stems from their childhood and other traumas that have shaped them. That being said, although I may understand her based on her history, it is not an excuse to inflict pain, judgement and hurtful things on to someone. I craved connection and a meaningful relationship with her but I did not get that in this trip. Instead I felt pain was inflicted on me especially I'm still postpartum - - the most vulnerable stage of my life. I was looking for understanding and love. So many other things happened! 
In the end before they left, I printed out photos and put it in a collage picture frame with a card from me to her saying I hope she sees past my imperfections and that I wish to have a meaningful bond with her. 

She lives overseas. I still crave connection but I'm deeply hurt by how she treated me. What does our future relationship look like? How do I go about this? I want to maintain peace but addressing that I don't want to be hurt nor be around that energy. Im so conflicted between standing up for myself and wanting a peaceful relationship with her. I don't want drama, nor stress, I don't want any toxic people in my life. Right now I'm feeling sad, defeated and just upset that this trip wasn't what I had hoped for.

I used to be able to tolerate tons of caffeine but as I get older it seems whenever I have some, at first I get like full awake / alert / focus.

But after a few weeks of 1 cup a day of coffee I get jittery but really sleepy, brain foggy etc. My sinuses will feel all gross.

If I quit for a week it resets and it will be fine.

Does this sound like the result of slow COMT and build up of catecholamines?

1nb8vxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1nb8vxz/mil_66f_flew_back_to_her_country_after_2_weeks/,MIL (66F) flew back to her country after 2 weeks with us. Feeling defeated and heartbroken,"Context: My MIL (66F) visited us for 2 weeks with her husband to meet her grand daughter for the first time. Myself 33F, husband 33M and baby 6 months. We are first time parents, keep this in mind. 

We were looking forward to this trip and now that it's over it has felt me feeling defeated. I hoped that MIL and I could form a meaningful connection, that I could get to know her deeper as she lives overseas. I hoped for a stronger bond with her now that I'm a mother myself.

I got to know her a little bit more as I asked her about her childhood here and there when given the chance however the majority of her stay I didn't feel love nor safe around her. She had a judging aura and made constant comments about how I did things. 

She would stop me from tending to my crying baby. For example my baby cried in the car seat which she normally does, when this happens we normally pull over when safe, take her out and have a short break. (disclaimer I checked with her pediatrian and a pediatric chiro they said some babies just hate carseats). 
But one time baby cried and cried and MIL said do not take the baby out because she knows I will remove her. So then baby cried and cried and I was so upset because I couldn't tend to my baby. (BTW give me some grace I know I can just do what I want but keep in mind I'm a First time mom, I'm Post partum and I'm being told what to do and idk how to act) 
This happened again another time. My baby cried and was looking at me, I wanted to pick her up but keeping in mind what my MIL said last time I was caught I didn't know what to do. Until the cries became hysterical, my daughter was so stressed. She never cries like that. I was getting stressed. I told my husband to take the nearest exit which he didn't. When he finally stopped MIL and her husband got out of the car and walked away. My daughter had pooped herself allover her back, she was crying so much, she does this when she is stressed. I hugged her and we were crying together. He and I got into a back and forth in the car. Voices raised. We were bickering, I was crying because I wasn't used to baby being so stressed and baby was hysterical. It was just a stressful situation all around. (my husband isn't an ass ok so no comments about that it was rush hour he said he was also stressed). 
So then MIL was upset at me because she said I blamed my husband (her son) because he didn't pullover like I asked. So she ignored me for the rest of the afternoon. Even at night she ignored me didn't say goodnight and didn't make a pot of coffee or eggs in the morning like she used to (showing me attitude basically). I don't really care for this but it shows her nature. 

Now on the other hand, I'm trying to understand her in the best of my abilities. I'm trying to understand why she would do certain things and act a certain way. A lot of what people do stems from their childhood and other traumas that have shaped them. That being said, although I may understand her based on her history, it is not an excuse to inflict pain, judgement and hurtful things on to someone. I craved connection and a meaningful relationship with her but I did not get that in this trip. Instead I felt pain was inflicted on me especially I'm still postpartum - - the most vulnerable stage of my life. I was looking for understanding and love. So many other things happened! 
In the end before they left, I printed out photos and put it in a collage picture frame with a card from me to her saying I hope she sees past my imperfections and that I wish to have a meaningful bond with her. 

She lives overseas. I still crave connection but I'm deeply hurt by how she treated me. What does our future relationship look like? How do I go about this? I want to maintain peace but addressing that I don't want to be hurt nor be around that energy. Im so conflicted between standing up for myself and wanting a peaceful relationship with her. I don't want drama, nor stress, I don't want any toxic people in my life. Right now I'm feeling sad, defeated and just upset that this trip wasn't what I had hoped for.

1nb8vby,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Noar_A/comments/1nb8vby/the_beacon_chapter_1/,The Beacon - Chapter 1,"*A quick note: This series is an interactive project. Your engagement‚Äîyour comments, your detailed theories, your ideas for where this world could go‚Äîwill directly impact the direction of the series. The more detailed, the better. I'm listening.*

The worst day of my life starts like a punchline, except nobody‚Äôs laughing, least of all me. I‚Äôm standing in the alley behind the Beacon Street View, holding a leaking trash bag in one hand and my phone in the other, trying to take a picture of the morning sun as it catches the edge of a dumpster and turns it into a blade of fire. The photo would be perfect‚Äîthe composition, the lighting, the contrast of hope and decay‚Äîif not for the rancid drip painting my shoes brown. I snap the shutter anyway. Evidence, I tell myself, that even entropy can be beautiful.

The alley smells like rotting yeast and cat piss. The cats are real; the yeast is only metaphorical, since we haven‚Äôt had a beer delivery in a week, and the bar‚Äôs last remaining keg is being rationed like plasma in a field hospital. I watch a tabby slink past, ears flattened, tail low. To the casual observer, it‚Äôs just a cat. To me, it‚Äôs another variable in an endless equation of decay‚Äîa living symbol of what the world is becoming.

Behind me, the back door slams. Victor‚Äôs heavy footfalls echo above the sharp clack of his cane. He‚Äôs been in a mood since sunrise, which means I should brace for impact. I prop the trash bag on the lip of the dumpster, already guessing what he‚Äôll say.

‚ÄúYou trying to poison the city‚Äôs last living wildlife?‚Äù Victor grunts, voice like gravel and old regret.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to create art,‚Äù I say, showing him the photo on my phone. He squints at the screen as if it might explode.

‚ÄúFucking beautiful,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúNow go hose off the alley before I get cited for public health violations.‚Äù His left sleeve swings empty at his side as he turns back inside.

I‚Äôm not sure if he means the photo or the alley, but I take the compliment anyway. Victor has never once asked me why I photograph things instead of, say, talk to people, or play a sport, or do literally anything else that eighteen-year-olds are supposed to do. I suspect he knows the answer, the true one, the one even I have trouble saying out loud: If you document something, it becomes real, and the only real things in my life are the ones I can frame, capture, and put somewhere safe.

I finish the trash and spray the alley clean, watching the brown rivulets disappear into the gutter. Then I check my phone for messages, though I already know there won‚Äôt be any. My father stopped texting me after the second evacuation order, and my mother left her last voicemail from a Red Cross tent four states away. The only message is a glitchy news alert: ARMY SEIZES KANSAS CITY. CURFEW IN EFFECT.

I go inside, blinking at the change in light, and take my place behind the bar. The Beacon used to be a church before the Depression, then a pool hall, then the kind of bar where nothing ever happened except slow financial death. The pews are long gone, but the stained glass windows remain, and at certain hours the colored beams cut through the dust like spotlights on a ruined stage. My favorite is the one above the dartboard: a fractured Christ whose wounds bleed neon onto the floor. I take a photo of that too, even though I already have a dozen versions. It‚Äôs different every day.

Victor is slicing lemons with surgical precision. He has a prosthetic arm, a hideous mechanical thing that he only wears when he needs both hands. Today, he is using the stub, pinning the lemon to the cutting board and sawing at it with the other. Some of the regulars say he lost the arm in Afghanistan, others in the first riots, but I‚Äôm pretty sure it got blown off by a mortar during the siege of Lincoln. Victor doesn‚Äôt correct them. He likes his mythology messy.

He slides a wedge of lemon into a chipped glass and pours gin over it. ‚ÄúWe open in ten,‚Äù he says, not looking at me. ‚ÄúGet the register counted. And try not to piss off Mr. Cho again.‚Äù

I count the register with the same care Victor gives his lemons. The math soothes me, the certainty of numbers, even if the total is abysmal. I lay the bills in a grid, fives and tens like soldiers in a doomed formation. My hands shake a little, as they always do when I‚Äôm being watched.

‚ÄúYou hear from your dad?‚Äù Victor asks, casual as a weather report.

‚ÄúNot in a while,‚Äù I say. I don‚Äôt add that I keep his last text saved in a folder labeled Evidence. As if, by preserving it, I can prevent the words from decaying into digital oblivion: Stay safe. Don‚Äôt trust anyone. Especially not the police.

Victor nods, which is as close as he gets to sympathy. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll turn up. Or he won‚Äôt. Either way‚Äî‚Äù He points the knife at the register. ‚ÄúMoney‚Äôs not going to count itself.‚Äù

I finish the count and pass him the slip. He glances at it and grunts again.

‚ÄúGo mop the floor,‚Äù he says, as if the mop will cleanse not just the linoleum, but the memory of every bad thing that has ever happened inside these walls.

I obey. I always obey. At 11:00 on the dot, we open the doors, even though there are only two customers waiting.

Mr. Cho sits at the bar, perfectly upright, hands folded around a glass of seltzer. He‚Äôs wearing a suit, which is either a statement or a form of self-preservation. He looks up as I pass, gives me a polite nod, then goes back to reading his battered paperback. The other customer is Nadia, a girl my age who used to go to the same high school before it was torched. She occupies a booth in the corner, backpack hugged to her chest, earbuds jammed in so deep I‚Äôm surprised she can hear anything at all. Her hair is buzzed on one side, the other left long. Every day, her hair is a different color; today, it‚Äôs Pepto pink, which makes her look vulnerable and radioactive at the same time.

Nadia comes here every day, orders the same thing (black coffee, three sugars), and spends hours watching grainy war footage on her laptop. She never speaks to anyone except to say ‚Äúthanks‚Äù or ‚Äúrefill.‚Äù I respect her for that. Words are for people who believe in being understood.

The noon crowd is a trickle: a retired cop who won‚Äôt admit he‚Äôs retired, a couple of drifters who trade conspiracy theories for shots of well whiskey, and a trio of college kids who keep trying to order things we don‚Äôt have, like kombucha or avocado toast. I serve them Bloody Marys and pretend not to notice their disappointment. The war has made everyone an improviser.

At 2:00, Victor disappears into his office to call the supplier, trying to bribe someone into delivering a case of vodka from Omaha. I man the bar, keeping an eye on the door. The news said there was a new checkpoint near the river, some kind of National Guard barricade, but so far, no one has come in talking about it.

I polish glasses. I arrange the liquor bottles by color gradient. I take photos of the sunlight creeping across the floor, marking the slow passage of time. I think: If I can just hold everything steady, maybe reality won‚Äôt collapse for another day.

At 03:47, the world changes.

A woman walks in, and the air pressure in the room drops. She‚Äôs tall‚Äîalmost a foot taller than me‚Äîand her hair is cut sharp across her jaw. Her clothes are city-black, boots polished, coat tailored. She sits at the bar and folds her hands like she‚Äôs waiting for a verdict.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôll it be?‚Äù I ask.

She looks at me, and her eyes are so dark I flinch. ‚ÄúWater. No ice.‚Äù

I pour the water, set it in front of her. She watches me with that same unblinking intensity. It makes my scalp crawl.

‚ÄúIs Victor in?‚Äù she asks, voice low and flat.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs in back,‚Äù I say.

She nods. ‚ÄúTell him he's time has ran out.‚Äù

I relay the message, but Victor is already standing in the doorway, wiping his hands on his apron. When he sees the woman, his face goes hard, like someone just told him the worst news of his life.

They talk in the corner, voices too quiet to hear. Nadia, in her booth, glances over her laptop, eyes narrowing. The college kids watch with open curiosity, while Mr. Cho resolutely does not look up from his book.

I‚Äôve seen this before, the moment when something big goes unsaid but leaves a residue on the walls.

Victor finishes talking with the woman‚Äîshe leaves without another word, her boots echoing in the empty space. He stands at the door long after she‚Äôs gone, staring at the parking lot like the past might crawl out of the pavement and drag him under.

When he finally comes back, I try to catch his eye, maybe to ask if things are okay, but he‚Äôs already turned away, reaching for the mop behind the bar. He starts scrubbing the floor with the kind of violence that doesn‚Äôt come out of linoleum. I want to say something, but I know better. I‚Äôve learned it‚Äôs safer to keep your questions sealed up until they dry into facts.

After a while he speaks, not looking at me. ‚ÄúCome here, Angel.‚Äù His voice is all wear.

I set down my glass and obey, standing at attention like a good soldier. Mr. Cho is gone, so is Nadia. The college kids have left behind a wet stack of coasters and a tip made of Canadian coins.

Victor leans on the bar, both hands splayed flat. ‚ÄúYou know what that was about?‚Äù

I shake my head, because I don‚Äôt, not really. I can only guess: money, old debts, war stuff, things I‚Äôm smarter not to ask about.

He sighs. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre done. Month, maybe less. I tried everything. She‚Äôs the last creditor. Once she comes around, you know it‚Äôs over.‚Äù

I wait for it to hit, the sadness or the relief, but all I feel is the room growing heavier. My world is typically a series of controlled frames, discrete exposures‚Äîthis is a panorama of collapse.

He keeps talking, unspooling in that way people do when they‚Äôre worried you might leave something unphotographed. ‚ÄúWhen I bought this place, I thought I could keep it going. Outlast the others. Thought even after the power cuts, the rationing, the curfews, people would want a place to come and be‚Ä¶‚Äù He trails off. He‚Äôs not a man for poetry.

‚ÄúPeople still come,‚Äù I offer, but it sounds feeble.

He waves it away. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt sell dreams on an empty tap. Tell that to the ghosts.‚Äù

We stand for a second in the light leaking through the window, both of us pretending this might be the worst of it. Then he says, ‚ÄúYou ever think about what you‚Äôd do if this place closed? Where you‚Äôd go?‚Äù

I want to say no, that I can‚Äôt imagine a world outside this bar, but that‚Äôs a lie. I think about it all the time, usually in the hour before sleep when my mind is sharpest and cruelest. I see myself as a ghost, wandering empty streets with no one left to document.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll figure something out,‚Äù I say.

Victor grunts, not buying it. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre smart. Too smart for this dump.‚Äù He fixes me with that one-good-eye stare. ‚ÄúYou know, for a kid who never says a word to the girls who come in here, you‚Äôre a hell of a people-watcher.‚Äù

I flush, because he‚Äôs not wrong, but also because I know what‚Äôs coming next. He always tries to nudge me into the world of Normal, as if I could be made to fit with enough exposure.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs this girl in the kitchen,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúher cousin. She‚Äôs decent. Doesn‚Äôt smoke meth.‚Äù He says it like a rare trait. ‚ÄúI could set you up. Could be good for you.‚Äù

I try to laugh it off, but it comes out more like a cough. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not really into that kind of thing.‚Äù

Victor shrugs. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt have to be serious. Just‚Äîget out there. See what‚Äôs left.‚Äù

Words hang in the air, sticky and unresolved. I feel the urge to tell him the truth, the deep-down reason why I never look at girls or boys or anyone the way I‚Äôm supposed to. There‚Äôs a word for it, one that sounds like a diagnosis, but I haven‚Äôt said it out loud since my last guidance counselor appointment, and even then it landed like a punchline at a funeral.

Instead, I say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just not interested.‚Äù I pick at a spot on the bar, trying to make the wood grain align.

Victor shakes his head. ‚ÄúEighteen and no hormones? You a robot?‚Äù

I want to say yes. That would be easier.

He laughs, but there‚Äôs no heat in it. ‚ÄúLet me know if you change your mind. World‚Äôs ending, might as well try everything once.‚Äù

I nod, but I‚Äôm thinking about the woman from earlier, the way she looked at Victor like she was measuring his days in teaspoons. I‚Äôm thinking about Nadia, hunched in the corner, and about my dad, whose last message was a warning not to trust anyone. I‚Äôm thinking about how sometimes the truest thing is the thing you can‚Äôt say.

I take my camera and go to the storeroom, where the light is always yellow and old. It smells like yeast in here too, but the real kind. I photograph the empty shelves, the dust motes, the streaks of rust on the walk-in fridge. I think about entropy, about how the world is designed to fall apart.

When I come back out, Victor is gone. There‚Äôs a note for me: Close up. Don‚Äôt let the National Guardsmen drink on credit.

The bar is empty except for Nadia, who is now sitting at the bar, her laptop closed. She stirs her coffee with a plastic straw, eyes on the reflection in the bottle display.

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù she asks, surprising me.

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúYou?‚Äù

She shrugs. ‚ÄúSame.‚Äù

It‚Äôs the closest we‚Äôve ever come to a real conversation, and I‚Äôm not sure what to do with it. There‚Äôs a silence, but it‚Äôs not uncomfortable. It‚Äôs just there, like a third person in the room.

After a minute, she says, ‚ÄúI like your photos.‚Äù She nods at the wall, where Victor hung a few of my prints in cheap black frames.

I feel something like embarrassment, but also a little pride. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù

She sips her coffee. ‚ÄúYou ever take pictures of people?‚Äù

‚ÄúSometimes.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not now?‚Äù

I look at her, and then at the camera in my hand. I raise it, and she doesn‚Äôt flinch, just looks straight at the lens. For a second, I think she‚Äôll smile, but she doesn‚Äôt. She just waits.

I take the photo. It‚Äôs perfect: her face framed by the riot of bottles, the light catching the pink in her hair, the look of someone who has survived every ending and is still waiting for the punchline.

I lower the camera. ‚ÄúWhy do you come here?‚Äù I ask.

She glances at the coffee, then at me. ‚ÄúOnly place left that feels real.‚Äù She shrugs. ‚ÄúAlso, you make the coffee right.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know how to respond, so I just refill her cup.

She taps the counter with a chewed fingernail. ‚ÄúYou ever leave this place?‚Äù

I shake my head. ‚ÄúNot if I can help it.‚Äù

She nods, like this makes sense. ‚ÄúI get it.‚Äù There‚Äôs a pause, and then: ‚ÄúI used to go places. Not anymore.‚Äù She looks at the door, as if remembering a time before curfews, before bombed highways and checkpoints.

Nadia pulls her backpack closer, unzips it a crack. Inside, I see the faded edge of an old photograph. ‚ÄúYou can keep that,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIf you want.‚Äù She slides the photo over the bar.

It‚Äôs a picture of three kids in a backyard, grinning at something off-camera. I recognize Nadia, but not the others. They look happy.

I tuck the photo into my pocket, not looking at her. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù

She leaves soon after, giving me a little wave. I watch her walk out through the colored light, her shadow long and thin on the concrete.

I stand there a long time after closing, cleaning glasses, stacking chairs, listening to the quiet. I think about what Victor said, about hormones and robots and the end of the world. I think about my parents, wherever they are, and about Nadia‚Äôs photo, and about the woman in black who measures the future.

The night settles in like a bruise. I go back to the alley and let the cold air hit my face. The cats are gone. The only sound is the whir of the highway in the distance, and for a minute, I let myself believe that tomorrow will be different. I hope that the cats will be back.

But I take a photo anyway, just in case. Evidence, I tell myself. That I was here, that I saw it, that even when the world is falling apart, somebody noticed.

I go inside, lock the doors. The bar won‚Äôt last the month, but for now, it‚Äôs still mine. I count this as a victory, even if it‚Äôs only temporary.

In the silence, I picture all the little truths‚Äîthe click of a shutter, the bitterness of coffee, the look in Nadia‚Äôs eyes. Maybe none of it means anything. Maybe it means everything. I write it down in my notebook, just to see how the words look when they‚Äôre alone on the page:

All stories are the same. Something breaks, someone watches, and the rest is aftermath.

I sleep in the booth by the window, my camera on the table, the old photo in my pocket. I dream of nothing, which is how I know I am still myself.

We were both attracted to each other, though keeping conversations interesting on video calls was sometimes difficult. I also noticed several red flags: he had an accidental child, had been a stoner since his teens, and this made his long term relationship fall apart. On the positive side, he had quit drugs, had a well-paying job, was co-parenting responsibly, worked out at home, and was a great cook. I decided to overlook the red flags and give him a chance, treating him like a human being.

We had a disagreement when talking about sexual health he wanted me to get an IUD because he didn‚Äôt like using condoms. Eventually, I started birth control before meeting him, since I lived far away and we had plans to see each other.

At one point, I thought about ending things, but he convinced me to keep trying. So, I spent a lot of money, took a 10-hour flight, and booked a hotel for the first night. We went to a fancy dinner, then back to my room where we had sex. Afterwards, I didn‚Äôt feel okay. I pretended to sleep, but throughout the night whenever my feet touched his, he pulled away, which made me feel very anxious.

In the morning, we had sex again, and he came inside me without my consent. When I asked, he admitted it and casually asked if it was okay. I brushed it off at the time, though it wasn‚Äôt.

Later, over coffee, he told me he didn‚Äôt think it was right between us. He said it was about the ‚Äúvibe‚Äù and that he didn‚Äôt feel a spark.

I‚Äôm left feeling embarrassed by my poor judgment. I genuinely liked him, put in a lot of effort, and hoped for something real. I was exhausted after traveling 30‚Äì40 hours without proper sleep, going straight to dinner, and then having sex all in one day. I can‚Äôt tell if my body was just too tired, or if it was the situation itself, but I wasn‚Äôt able to be fully present. That first time we had sex we both didn't come or maybe only I didn't, I don't remember but the second time he did and again I did not. He couldn't tell that I wasn't well lubricated and Idk if he knew and didn't care but he left me with a terrible cut down there that kept bleeding for a few days. 

When he said he doesn't feel it's right for him I tried to understand him and I was stupid enough to even comfort him and tell him it's life and then I asked him to leave me alone and go. He went away and I felt so devastated and lonely with 8 days left before my return flight, my world felt like crashing to pieces because I did not expect this. In fact, before I travel he was scared that I might meet him in person and decide not to move forward yet it was him who did that to me which is insane. I'm so confused and feel so terrible about myself, feeling I was rejected in the worst way possible. 

I try to tell myself that it was probably for my advantage that it didn't work and that he was a sexiest, selfish man who was so vulgar and just so wrong, I try not to allow myself to miss him and remind myself how disgusting of a person he is. But, I feel so hurt and don't know how to deal with the feelings. I should learn from this experience and try to understand why was my judgment so poor? Why did I not protect myself better? What made me do this, was it hope, desperation, lack of self esteem? Do I have past traumas and old unresolved emotions? Idk

I'm so disappointed in myself. I was finally getting my life together, started to workout and crawled out of depression and took care of my diet. I was finally doing well and thought I'm ready to be in love and start something good. Now, I'm so scared of falling back into depression, I have not skipped the gym so that's good but the birth control pills are also affecting me on top of everything else. I really don't want to fall back into depression, I'm so scared of that. Oh and I'm fairly a successful woman with a postgraduate, I have done a lot of exciting things so that makes me extra disappointed in myself and not having the maturity to realize how wrong this person was for me. But relationship wise I have not had much experience I only dated once for a few years and that didn't end well so I'm not experienced in relationships or in understanding men.

A few winters ago, a man sat in a hospital parking lot with a coffee that had gone cold. A close friend was inside waiting for test results. He remembered staring at the gray sky and finally blurting out,¬†*‚ÄúLord, I need You here.‚Äù*¬†That was all he had. No flowery words. No formula. Just a shaky prayer in a car that smelled like old coffee.

Something shifted, though. The knot in his chest didn‚Äôt disappear, but it eased up. Not because the situation suddenly turned around‚Äîit didn‚Äôt. But because God showed up right in the middle of the fear.

That night reminded them of something we all still need to relearn again and again: prayer doesn‚Äôt have to be complicated. Healing works, and it starts with trust, and trust starts with just showing up‚Äîraw, unpolished, and honest.

If you‚Äôre carrying pain today, I‚Äôm not going to hand you a slogan. I just want to sit here with you, open Scripture, and share five healing prayers that have helped me (and people I love) walk through sickness into healing. They touch every part of life: body, mind, relationships, work, and faith. Because pain doesn‚Äôt stay in one place. It can spill into everything.

# Why healing prayer matters today

You don‚Äôt need me to tell you things are rough right now. Scroll the news for five minutes and it‚Äôs obvious. Loneliness is everywhere. Even the U.S. Surgeon General is calling it an epidemic. Doctors keep saying that being disconnected doesn‚Äôt just hurt our feelings‚Äîit actually wrecks our health. And the people we lean on most, like nurses and caregivers? A lot of them are just plain exhausted.

So yeah, sickness isn‚Äôt just the flu or a broken arm. It gets into everything. It can mess with your head, your relationships, even your sense of why you get out of bed.

That‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt treat prayer like some little religious duty. Honestly, it‚Äôs been air to me. Oxygen. There were days I didn‚Äôt know what else to do, and the only thing that kept me standing was talking to God.

Tim Keller once said prayer is how our loves get reordered. I didn‚Äôt really get that at first, but it makes more sense now. When I bring my body, my kids, or even my doubts to God, something shifts in me. The storm may keep raging, but I don‚Äôt go under with it. Somehow, I stay above water and overcome it.

# 5 Powerful Healing Prayers for Sickness

Here are five healing prayers for the main areas of the Christian life, each grounded in Scripture, personal reflection, and lived experience.

# Prayer 1 ‚Äî For the body

**Scripture:**  
‚ÄúHeal me, Lord, and I will be healed; save me and I will be saved.‚Äù (Jeremiah 17:14)  
‚ÄúIs anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders‚Ä¶ and the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well.‚Äù (James 5:14‚Äì15)

**Prayer:**  
Lord, You know this body better than I ever could. I feel tired of fighting it. Some parts ache, others just don‚Äôt work the way they used to. Touch and heal what‚Äôs broken, in Jesus Name. Settle what‚Äôs flaring up. Give the doctors clear heads, steady hands. And if healing is slow, give me the grit to walk it out. I don‚Äôt need perfect‚ÄîI just want enough strength to keep going with You because I know You're faithful to perform what You promised. Amen.

# Prayer 2 ‚Äî For the mind

**Scripture:**  
‚ÄúThe Lord sustains him on his sickbed.‚Äù (Psalm 41:3)  
‚ÄúBy His wounds we are healed.‚Äù (Isaiah 53:5)

**Prayer:**  
Father God, my thoughts feel like a room full of buzzing flies. I can‚Äôt quiet them down. Fear loops. Sadness hangs heavy. I bind and rebuke the noise and distractions, in Jesus Name. Remind me I‚Äôm not broken beyond repair. Remind of the healing truth of Your Word when lies start shouting. Build some new grooves in my mind where peace can flow. And if all I can manage is to breathe out Your Name, let that be enough to do the job of divine health. Amen.

# Prayer 3 ‚Äî For relationships

**Scripture:**  
‚ÄúA joyful heart is good medicine.‚Äù (Proverbs 17:22)  
‚ÄúConfess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed.‚Äù (James 5:16)

**Prayer:**  
Father, sickness has a way of messing with people I love. Words get sharp. Distances stretch. I hate it, but I‚Äôve felt it. Please heal more than my body‚Äîheal the space between us, in Jesus Name. Teach me to forgive even when I don‚Äôt feel like it. Give me humility to ask for forgiveness when I‚Äôve made things worse. I don‚Äôt want bitterness to have the last word. I speak healing and unity over my relationship(s). Amen.

# Prayer 4 ‚Äî For work and purpose

**Scripture:**  
‚ÄúThe Lord will uphold you with His righteous right hand.‚Äù (Isaiah 41:10)  
‚ÄúWhatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord.‚Äù (Colossians 3:23)

**Prayer:**  
Lord, I can‚Äôt do what I used to. That stings. My pace is slower, my capacity smaller. I speak healing into this situation, in Jesus Name. Show me what still matters. Let me bring peace or kindness into one room, one conversation. Even if my work looks different now, let it count. Draw a line of purpose through my days so I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm wasting them.

# Prayer 5 ‚Äî For spirit and faith

**Scripture:**  
‚ÄúThe prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well.‚Äù (James 5:15)  
‚ÄúThe Lord is my shepherd‚Ä¶ He restores my soul.‚Äù (Psalm 23)

**Prayer:**  
God, I don‚Äôt like waiting. You already know that. I want the miracle yesterday. But here I am‚Äîstill asking, still tired, still holding on. I will keep trusting Your Word when I can‚Äôt feel much. Be the hand I grip when I‚Äôm weak. Slow me down when I‚Äôm racing, push me forward when I want to quit. However You decide to answer, please don‚Äôt let me wander from You. Amen.

# What healing prayer looks like in real life

Martha scribbles in a beat-up notebook at her kitchen table. Half the time the handwriting‚Äôs crooked because her hands ache. One verse, one thank-You, nothing fancy. She does it between pills and dishes. Somehow it helps her push through the morning.

Diego and Aly set their phones to buzz at noon. Not for meds, not for meetings ‚Äî just a reminder:¬†Pray Psalm 41:3 for Mom.¬†Most days it‚Äôs a quick thirty-second whisper, but it became this anchor that held them steady when everything else felt upside down.

And the nurses‚Ä¶ they finally admitted they were bone-tired, burned out. A group at church started praying just for them. Not for the patients ‚Äî for the ones dragging themselves into the hospital every day. That mattered more than they realized.

# A messy but doable rhythm

If you want to try something this week, keep it simple:

* In the morning, read one healing verse out loud. Jeremiah 17:14 is a solid one.
* At midday, throw up one healing prayer for your body, one for your mind, and one for a relationship. Doesn‚Äôt have to be long.
* At night, jot down one thing you‚Äôre thankful for and one place you noticed God show up.
* And at least once, ask somebody to pray with you. Even if it feels awkward.

Don‚Äôt turn it into homework. Just keep it doable.

# Final thought

If I could, I‚Äôd hand you healing tied up in a bow. I can‚Äôt. And I hate watching people suffer. Sometimes God moves fast. Other times it‚Äôs slower ‚Äî strength you didn‚Äôt know you had, peace that straps you in when the road gets rough. It still counts as healing. It still counts as Him.

He hasn‚Äôt gone anywhere. Neither has healing. He sees you. He‚Äôs closer than you think.

God bless you.

New to this sub so apologies in advance! 

I have had my Breville barista pro for about a year at this point but I keep having issues dialing in my Starbucks Blonde Espresso roast. Beans are fresh (always within the past few days to a week) and sealed via airlock when not in use (measured for each shot/double shot)

Each time I make a shot (I only drink double espressos) my machine pulls too much liquid in a short period of time. Measurements are as followed: 18g beans ground on internal burr of 2 external burr of 3, pulling 50+g of liquid in 25 seconds. I have gone with a smaller grind size but it feels like dust if I go any thinner. 

In terms of tools I have tried tamping more and less with the given tamp tool, as well as a circular distributor tool/tamp. The distributor tool helped marginally by making sure there were no cavities water was escaping. I also recently bought a puck screen which also helped but not enough to get me to a normal shot. 

Looking for any and all suggestions at this point. Yes I do understand it is likely due to the fact it‚Äôs blonde espresso (which is more finicky) and also the espresso isn‚Äôt the highest quality of coffee (Starbucks). Just was hoping I could figure it out to have a solid golden pull with the correct amount of liquid in appropriate time period. 

I have started from scratch a number of times by resetting to factory settings. 

Edit: I have also decreased my bean amount to 15/16g which didn‚Äôt help

1nb8nm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkatives/comments/1nb8nm2/thinking_is_a_futile_escape/,Thinking is a Futile Escape,"Hey Everyone,

I was asked to join this forum by the head moderator. I don't think it's a good fit for me, but I'm happy to explain why.

Years ago, I was a scientist and hardcore militant atheist. The atom and the subatomic particles they are made of constituted the base of reality in my world -- textbook materialism.

Long story short, I became deeply depressed, let go of everything that was dear to me, and accidentally died, tried to go to heaven, was rejected, had a golden umbilical cord cut, and then met, then merged in God.

It started as a curiosity, ""Hey, what was that bright light that appears at the center of your vision when you get waaay to high? What happens when you go into it?""

I had found a special cocktail of drugs that let you bounce in and out of anaesthesia without much memory loss. I would later know it as Soma, the elixir of life.

Anyways, I zoomed into the tunnel of light, right towards the center. Next thing I knew it was like I was far, far above Earth as if I were past the moon. There were two beings there -- one gray and one black, both orbs, and connected together like a pair of testes -- constantly touching but with faint silver cords rising out of the top of them.

The place I was in felt like a waiting room at a doctor's office: extremely stuffy and a little foreboding. The two beings were murmuring to each other that ""What is he doing??? He's not supposed to be here yet!"" It seemed they were my guardian angels and were rather cross with me for dying prematurely.

I didn't even believe in that shit, and was totally baffled as to how I could telepathically understand these orbs, and in my confusion I began to float into a grand void. 

Suddenly I had the thought, ""the only way I could get higher than this is by going to heaven."" With indescribable haste, I was catapulted towards this place that 30 seconds ago I was sure did not exist. Within seconds, I arrived at a place bounded by fluffy golden clouds, and I bounced right off. 

It hit me like hugging an H-Bomb. I had been dead wrong about heaven and therefore God and therefore the afterlife. In absolute crushing, defeating confusion, I found myself alone in the void to contemplate how catastrophically wrong I'd been.

At my lowest moment, suddenly I felt upward movement. The corners of my vision condensed into 4 golden strands, then pooled towards the middle of my vision, making the shape of a golden, spinning umbilical cord. It shrank and shrank as if being pulled taught, my vision and world tunneling along with it. 

Suddenly, it shattered, and the next thing I knew I was before *The Light*. I was smote, instantly. She showed me that everything emanates from Her Light, which I experienced as incalculable, oceanic Love, unfathomable bliss, and universal forgiveness.

She then showed me myself and my dear partner as our soul bodies. They appeared as two identical orbs filled with overwhelming white light with blue at the fringes. Almost identical to the magelight spell from Skyrim, but perfectly spherical. The remarkable thing She showed me is that there was zero differences between me, my partner, Her, and the grand Void She rests in. We are all One.

In overwhelming gratitude, I pledged my soul to that which had slain me, asking one final wish: I want that which slain me to take my place to finish out my human life. The next thing that happened was freaky: I saw my soul orb depart from where I was and dissolve into the black Void beside Her. And then ""I"" headed into the Void, back towards my body.

Right before I entered the tunnel that was my life, I could see every event all at once, and I glimpsed the Truth that every single thing I had ever done that led me to that experience was absolutely perfect beyond my wildest conception. I saw that not one iota of the creation is left to chance; that there are no coincidences. 

On the way back to my body, it was very uncomfortable. Being in ultimate bliss makes everything else seem downright dreadful. But on the way back, I became a dark-brown wooden coffee table. I *became* the table, and had all the faculties you'd imagine a table to have: not many. Talk about claustrophobic!

After a short stint as a table, I came to my body, reentering through the very top of my head. I immediately began bawling, crying like I had been mindraped. Within the span of two minutes my entire world had burned to ashes. I got up of the bed and immediately started doing yoga stretches.

I cried and cried and cried for hours and days, bewildered by what I had done. Ever since that moment, every time I close my eyes, I now see that same light I was so curious about (it's a cool blue color now instead of pure white). 

But the weirdest, scariest effect was becoming possessed: it was like there was now another guy in my body. This new guy was super chill but I didn't trust him. ""Who are you and why have you invaded me?"" I wept and begged to know for days.

One day I'm in the kitchen, begging to know who the mystery companion is, and as I shut our black refrigerator, I see a yogi, a guy with tall matted hair, blue skin, wearing a tiger skin, carrying a golden trident. And the most peaceful, assured smile.

It took me much effort and searching, but years later I can give more context to what I stumbled into. The Hindu tradition has the best framework for making sense of what happened to me. By the highest grace of The Light, Adi Parashakti, I merged my Soul in Parashiva. I destroyed my mind -- manonasha -- and became jivanmukta, liberated while alive. I surrendered my soul before Her so that I could realize that I had been Him all along. Causeless, timeless, spaceless, pure Love.

Creation takes place within the infinite mind through the motion of  Adi Parashakti. Absolutely everything emanates from The Light, and She is feminine in nature. As forever One with Her, we are always every infinity, every atom in every creation, all while being completely transcendent of every creation at the same time. Our consciousness roams the grand mind within the Godhead to give rise to the myriad experiences.

Here's the real kicker: everything is already complete. The grand mind, the Godhead all this takes place in is utterly finished, complete, and whole. Nothing left to be added or subtracted; raw infinite perfection now and forever. 

Thinking will never lead you to the fact that God *is* Love. Thinking can never be your escape, only your means to surrender. 

TL;DR: If you wanna know and experience who you really are at your core, thinking will never take you there. Who you are is far beyond the thinking mind; you can only know your ineffable Self through Love and complete surrender. The only good thought is the thought that burns down everything you thought you knew so that you are able to see The Truth. All of creation is our playground. Don't think too hard; your Truth is far above paltry human comprehension.",1,1757288914.0,thinkatives,3,0.6,False

1nb8bha,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1nb8bha/the_videos_wont_stop/,The Videos Won‚Äôt Stop,"Look, we‚Äôve all fallen into the social media trap of doom scrolling, sometimes maybe even for hours on end. We as a human species have reached a point in our timeline where every ounce of our day could be consumed by the small computer that we each conceal in our pockets. I‚Äôm no different than anyone else; I, too, have succumbed to this trap on multiple occasions, too many to even count.

But there‚Äôs something evil within these apps. I don‚Äôt know what it is or how it works. Hell, this may be a demon designated to me alone. Or an AI, who knows at this point? All I know is the other night, I was lying in bed after a long day‚Äôs work, trying to unwind and scroll some reels. Everything was normal for the first hour or so; the usual car accidents, shitposts, and memes. However, as I fell deeper into the doomscrolling, I came across a video that just showed‚Ä¶me..? Sitting at the dinner table with my brother and parents. The table was set beautifully, and my mother had prepared a nice meal of what seemed to be meatloaf, a meal she had never cooked before.

I was completely stunned. I couldn‚Äôt believe what I was seeing, and the video went on for 10 straight minutes, just showing us as we ate quietly. Once every plate was cleaned, and we all started to get up to walk away, the video restarted back to the beginning. I rushed to my parents‚Äô room to show them what I‚Äôd found, but by the time I got there, the feed had refreshed entirely.

I mean, how do you even explain that to someone, ‚Äúhey, I just saw us eating dinner on Instagram, that‚Äôs probably something to look out for,‚Äù like what? No. Luckily, though, I had remembered the username. I typed user.44603380 into the Instagram search bar, and only one account popped up. When I clicked on it, I was baffled to find that there were no posts made at all, just a blank page. However, there was one clear sign of evidence that I was looking in the right place: the profile picture. See, this account had zero followers, zero following, and everything about the page looked grey and new. Everything except for the profile picture, which was me, yet again, staring into the camera for a photo I did not take. My face was soulless and hollow. Barely maintaining the essence of a human.

This was clear evidence, though, and I ran to show my parents again. I was profoundly disappointed when both my mom and dad insisted that it had to be one of my friends playing some kind of prank on me. I don‚Äôt know why I expected either of them to understand. I mean, they‚Äôre parents, what do they know about social media? Nevertheless, I reported the account for pretending to be someone else, and by the next morning, it had been taken down. Relieved, I went to work with warmth in my chest.

When I got home, I repeated the process. Kicked my shoes off, plopped down on the bed, and began scrolling. This time, a good quarter of what I saw was me, posted from different, all-new accounts. None of the videos were actually me; they all captured me doing things that I had never once done. Walking a dog I never had, browsing at a library I‚Äôd never seen before, all taken from obscure angles like the person behind the camera was hiding.

Thoroughly creeped out, I reported every single page I came across. It totaled up to something like 30 different accounts, all dedicated to me, and I got the notification when each one had been taken down. I decided to take a break from the reels after that, putting my phone away in a drawer and going outside for some fresh air. I actually didn‚Äôt even pick up my phone again until it was time for work the next day.

When I did, a notification was displayed across the screen. I had been informed that my Instagram account had been taken down for ‚Äúpretending to be someone else.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know what to do, so I sent an appeal to Instagram and just went to work, albeit a little on edge. When I got off, I was astounded to find that my appeal had been rejected and that it would take 30 days before I could launch a new one.

Whatever, right, but I had a real problem going on, I couldn‚Äôt just not watch as it unfolded. I set up a basic new account and started scrolling. It didn‚Äôt take long before I found myself again. Getting coffee, stopping off for gas, interacting with people I‚Äôd never met. Eventually, that‚Äôs all that my new page consisted of: just videos of me every time I scrolled. There were now too many accounts to report all with that same random string of numbers username.

As I scrolled, the videos changed. I was no longer out doing the mundane. I was now walking down the road in every video. Walking down a road that I recognized as the one just before my actual neighborhood. Then it was in my driveway, then at my doorstep, then, as if nothing happened, back to the regular Instagram feed. Puppies, nature, advertisements. All the accounts were gone. All the videos were gone. And I felt like I was going crazy.

I tossed my phone to the side and just lay in my bed, staring up at the ceiling. I drifted off into deep thought, which eventually turned into sleep. When I awoke, I went through my normal process: getting dressed, making the bed, you know the deal. When I checked my phone, I stood utterly horrified as hundreds of videos showed up, all with thousands of views, all showing the third-person perspective of me murdering my parents.

I basically exploded out of my bedroom door to find the walls coated in blood, so much so that it appeared the walls were leaking with the crimson liquid. The smell of iron radiated throughout the entire house, and when I entered my parents‚Äô bedroom, I found them sprawled across the bed, stab wounds decorating their bare torsos. Instagram still pulled up on my device, I heard as police sirens came flooding in through the phone‚Äôs speakers.

When I raised the screen to my face, I saw myself, standing over my parents‚Äô bed, cellphone in hand. A mixture of confusion, desperation, and terror plastered across my face. That‚Äôs when the room began to flash red and blue as police lights came pouring in through the bedroom windows. A loud pounding came from the front door before it flew open and splintered as an armed SWAT unit came rushing in, rifles trained on me. They pinned me to the floor and my phone went flying from my hand, bouncing across the floor and landing propped up against the wall.

The last thing I saw on the feed was me being handcuffed before it refreshed back to the kittens and baking recipes. I was brought in for questioning, and my lawyer insisted I plead insanity. I‚Äôm writing this from a holding cell in a notebook, and I plan to have my lawyer publish it and send it out to wherever he can.

I kinda know what the problem is but I don't know how to fix it. Need advice.,"Hello, so I went on a date today. It was a coffee date and it went for an hour and a half. 3 hours after the date I messaged her on Hinge telling her I had a good time and that we should meet up again. Circled back to a compliment I made about her earrings on the date. She messaged back an hour and a half later saying she doesn't feel a connection.

I'm pretty sure I know what the problem is. Well, I shouldn't say pretty sure; I definitely know. I'm not flirty and I ""interview"" the women. But I feel like if I don't maintain the momentum of a conversation, the atmosphere will become flat. Almost like I'm trying to prevent silence from encroaching in. If the women aren't conversational back, I feel like I have to drive the conversation. I do try and talk about myself and my interests too, and I try really hard to relate to the girl's interests and hobbies, but the whole thing definitely feels more like catching up with a friend. I also don't want to objectify my date; I don't want to lean too hard into talking about their appearance or treating them like a piece of meat. 

I have really bad social anxiety and I am very nervous on these dates. Still, I try really hard. I'm not a bad guy and on paper everything is perfect w/ me: Great job, good car, in great shape, have friends and go out. But it's my lack of experience w/ flirting w/ women and my social anxiety that always fucks me. 

I have 2 ideas. The first being to get a therapist; maybe they can help me overcome some of my anxiety so I don't care so much and just act like a flirty idiot. The second is I should maybe try befriending more women online so I have a better idea on how to talk with them. Idk what else to do honestly. ",2,1757287831.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

**Step-by-Step Breakdown (with tips the pros keep quiet):**

- So, I found this platform right here: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** (yes, that same link keeps popping up in ‚Äúmake money online‚Äù circles‚Ä¶ I finally caved in and checked it myself).  
- Signed up‚Äîtook like 3 mins tops. No weird info needed.
- They show you a list of apps that need REAL user feedback. All I had to do: download, test, give honest thoughts.
- Some paid out instantly, others took a few hours. ALL super straightforward; no sketchy crypto junk or aggressive data BS.

At first, my *skeptic-meter* was maxed out. But after a quick run-through‚Ä¶

Guys, payments dropped into my PayPal before lunch. Not a joke. I practically SPIT OUT my cold brew.

---

Why did this work so well?

- You're not just earning pennies‚Ä¶ some apps pay $10+ PER test.
- There‚Äôs a constant stream of new apps‚Äîso you can definitely scale this.
- They don‚Äôt push annoying ads while you‚Äôre inside the testing gigs (for once!).
- Mobile-friendly AF, which means you don‚Äôt need a laptop or anything fancy.

THE WILD PART: Out of curiosity, I tried pushing hard and, guess what‚Ä¶ $100. IN. A. DAY. 

Even took a photo to memorialize that PayPal notification (If you want proof, DM me!üòâ)

---

Now, I‚Äôm NOT saying you‚Äôll magically earn $100 every single day, ‚Äòcause there are some less-paying gigs mixed in, but the experience legit shocked me enough that I had to share. Still can‚Äôt get over how easy it was.

If you‚Äôre doom-scrolling for a *no-joke* passive gig, give it a shot:  
**[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**  
(TIP: Check back hourly for new offers, seriously!)

---

Just be smart:

- Don‚Äôt quit your day job off ONE lucky run.
- Stay honest with your feedback (that‚Äôs how you get invited to the higher-pay tests).
- Don‚Äôt download sketchy apps‚Äîif it feels fishy, skip it. The platform actually filters out a lot, but you do you.

If you‚Äôve been on the fence about side hustles or are just suspicious of *all* the ‚Äúquick cash‚Äù claims, I feel you. But sometimes the hype is‚Ä¶ well, real.  
I‚Äôm still floored, LOL.

I guess this is my sign!,"Long story short my wife sent me a text that was intended, from what I've gathered, for her sister. She described me as looking like a ""meaty, hairy sack of oatmeal"" and made it very, very clear to her sister that she no longer finds me physically attractive. I'm more embarrassed than upset right now, but I'm not sure where to direct the feeling.

So, LoseIt, I come to you asking for your best guides and routines to become healthy again. I'm currently using Gemini and the sidebar to learn about CICO and how to incorporate exercise as my current job leaves me sedentary at the desk most of the day.

I'm currently 39 years old, 6' tall, and 356 pounds. My initial goals will be to lose 10 pounds by October 7, lose at least 30 pounds by December 31, better my relationship with food, and learn how to drown out food noise as I am a chronic snacker. Luckily I don't drink soda, but I do love my morning iced coffee during my drive to the office.

I've downloaded the Lose It! app and found a coupon code for a lifetime membership and am considering getting a fitbit to help track steps, heart rate, etc. What have you all found useful in obtaining your goals?

Thanks much in advance, 

Meaty Hairy Sack of Oatmeal

Update: Holy cow this got a lot bigger than I expected it to! Thank you all for the support, encouragement, and also for the harsh honesty that some folks provided. No, I'm not divorcing my wife. I love my family. From the advice that some of you provided I've gotten myself a good scale, downloaded the LoseIt! app for calorie tracking, and made a Costco run for some meal prep.

Introduction to me
I love to read looking for someone to start a book with, go on museum trips, 
I‚Äôm looking for friendship that could turn into more, with someone who knows how to have fun but also shows up when things get real.

I‚Äôm the kind of person who walks into a room and makes sure no one leaves without laughing at least once. My personality is loud and unapologetically silly ‚Äî I love being weird in the best way possible. But beneath all that, I‚Äôm also deeply kind, generous, and humble. Loyalty means everything to me, and when I care about someone, I show up for them wholeheartedly.

Books are my happy place ‚Äî whether I‚Äôm curled up at home or roaming the aisles of a bookstore, I‚Äôm always looking for my next story. Museums are another favorite spot of mine; I love being surrounded by art, history, and ideas that spark conversation. At the same time, I‚Äôm always up for having fun ‚Äî whether that‚Äôs exploring a new place, being goofy with friends, or turning an ordinary day into an adventure.

I‚Äôm hoping to meet someone who‚Äôs patient and understanding. I live with anxiety and bipolar disorder, and I want a partner or friend who‚Äôs emotionally mature enough to communicate, listen, and support without judgment. To me, strength isn‚Äôt about never struggling ‚Äî it‚Äôs about showing compassion and holding space for each other.

If you can balance humor with depth, silliness with sincerity, and fun with responsibility, we‚Äôll get along just fine. Bonus points if you love reading (or are at least willing to start a book with me), enjoy museum trips, and don‚Äôt mind late-night conversations that drift from random jokes to life‚Äôs biggest questions.


I‚Äôm not just looking for romance; I value genuine friendship too. Ideally, I want someone who can be both ‚Äî my best friend and maybe something more, if the connection grows. A relationship where we can laugh until we cry, support each other through the ups and downs, and build something real.",2,1757287539.0,DDLGpersonalsRO,1,1.0,False

I'm at my wits' end trying to dial in a new coffee bean at work and am at the point where I need to ask for help. 

I'm just doing coffee for staff of an office in the morning, using a La San Marco 100E double head coffee machine and a Mazzer Luigi Mini grinder. Not optimal, but it's what I have access to. 

We've had the grinder for about a month now, after the old one broke, and I've been trying to dial the coffee back in ever since then. I'm getting better results on pre ground supermarket coffee that runs a 10 second extraction. Every day I find new and exciting ways to make an undrinkable coffee - today it tasted exactly like bitter cardboard.

I've tried everything I can think of and a few things others suggested and nothing has fixed the issue so far. I m, however, not super experienced as a fixer of coffee issues, so I'm sure there are things I have missed. I have tried:
- Adjusting grind size
- Doing a full clean of the grinder
- Sharpening the blades of the grinder, which should not have even been dull
- Changing the extraction temperature
- Changing the amount of water in the recipe
- Changing the amount of ground coffee in the recipe (this is the one I'm least confident I've fully explored - the basket I have holds 22g or slightly more, but if I reduce the quantity it holds a level of water which doesn't get pushed through).

Changing the smallest thing swings the results wildly, far more than I would expect in a professional setting. I've had it go from unspeakably sour to overextracted and burnt within a notch on the grinder dial. 

The most prominent issue has been a sourness that I've never experienced from another bean before, even when heavily underextracted. While I'm not above concluding the bean is at fault, I've had this issue over multiple batches from Campos, who I would not expect to be that bad. 

Currently, I have my extraction temperature set to 94¬∞C, as 92 was producing a watery flavour and somewhat thin mouthfeel, despite a good crema. Higher temperatures were concentrating the flavours present and therefore the issues, and adding a persistent level of bitterness. 

So far, the best extraction I achieved was a 2 minute long extraction at 98¬∞C, done before I sharpened the burrs. I don't know how that was the best, but yeah. Any help, ideas or recommendations are greatly appreciated. ",2,1757286815.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

\*long exegesis on life situation incoming ‚Äì questions at end\*

I need to leave where I am (and very likely academia as well) for the sake of my wellbeing, but I don‚Äôt know what to do next.

I am a 43-year-old single immigrant woman. I received tenure in 2024 at a small public university in a small midwestern city after a decade-long PhD process with a checked out, ‚Äòfamous‚Äô advisor. I am in a very humanistic part of a social science field and have a minuscule research profile and a lot of teaching and admin experience. Which is all to say that I don‚Äôt really have a network to draw on, and have lost touch with the minimal network I had prior to starting this job. I have a few good friends scattered around the country and my parents and siblings are supportive, but they are far away in both geographic terms and in terms of life in academia.

I have made a few friends in this city, but no one I can really confide in. After a grueling academic year (year 6 at this school, after some adjuncting at community colleges before landing this TT job), I made it to sabbatical and promptly fell into the most severe depression of my life (which is saying something since I‚Äôve been depressed since my teen years). I was mostly catatonic for the months of May-June (with the exception of the daily sobbing!). I‚Äôm under the care of a therapist, thankfully, and have been clawing my way out over the last couple of months, though moments of joy or satisfaction are still minimal and fleeting. I am far from functional, even though I‚Äôm now sort of able to work on my few long overdue writing projects. I‚Äôve been trying to find other hobbies to focus on ‚Äì drawing, games, exercise ‚Äì but the voice in my head telling me I need to finish my work, and that I am a failure in general, is constant.

I also have a lot of debt (student loans and consumer debt from grad school in a high COL place) and decided to cancel my sabbatical travel plans to try to pay this down and put myself in a better financial position to leave here after doing my contractually mandated post-sabbatical year of teaching. So I feel stuck as midwestern winter comes on. I know all of the things one is meant to do ‚Äì get out of the house, reach out to people, exercise, etc. I also know I am very lucky as far as academia today goes ‚Äì I have a well-paid, secure job in the field that I chose. Many of my friends from grad school left academia and got government jobs, non-profit jobs, university admin jobs, etc. in our late 20s/early 30s and stayed in the major city where we went to school. I keep in touch with a few of them, but have lost touch with most. Nearly a decade later, I feel like the choice I made to drop everything in order to pursue an academic job in any location was wrong ‚Äì I have tried so hard to make a life here, but try as I might, I don‚Äôt like this place. I love food and coffee and public third spaces and don‚Äôt like that this is a food desert of mainly chain restaurants, family events, and car culture, where most socializing takes place in people‚Äôs homes or backyards. I have sort of tried to date and have made a couple of friends with people with whom dating didn‚Äôt work out, but there are few people I mesh with in this very conservative place, even more so since I turned 40. In the past three years, I have been too exhausted from work down on myself to even try to date, which I‚Äôm sure doesn‚Äôt help matters re: loneliness, community, etc.

Even all of that might be okayish, if there was any kind of intellectual community to be part of at this university, but there isn‚Äôt. My colleagues are generally kind, and I spend time with them socially every few weeks, but no one ever talks about their intellectual work and conversations are superficial on the whole ‚Äì complaining about admin, teaching etc. By contrast, a couple of years ago, I gave a talk as part of a lecture series at a similarly tiny public university on the east coast and was floored at how different the intellectual culture there was. I try not to be complacent and just complain about what this place lacks. I have tried three times over the past six years to start reading groups, speaker series, research sharing events, but nothing sticks. People say they are interested but it fizzles out after the first event. I suppose I could be reaching out to people elsewhere and rebuilding the networks I made in grad school but I just feel exhausted and ‚Äì due to the depression/burnout ‚Äì like I don‚Äôt even have anything to contribute anymore.

This is where I find myself a couple of months into this sabbatical, when I'm supposed to be deep in research and enjoying my time to myself. It is hard not to feel like I have failed to make this place home, that it is my fault that I don‚Äôt like it here, and that I feel like I need to leave academia. All of this is bound up with shame, of course. I don‚Äôt think my profile is remotely competitive for other academic jobs (even starting again at Assistant Professor) and I have no idea what I want to do ‚Äì or could do ‚Äì next. The feeling that ‚Äúit‚Äôs too late, I‚Äôm too old‚Äù is strong, even though I know it‚Äôs probably not  true. I do know lot of ‚Äújob research‚Äù is ahead of me, but I‚Äôd love any outside input. If you were in my position, what would you do:

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Future job-wise?

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† To get through the next year and a half here?

If you‚Äôve read thus far, thank you. I am a constant and compulsive Reddit lurker, and I appreciate this community a lot, even though I rarely contribute to it.

1nb7upb,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1nb7upb/success_story_60_pounds_down_in_8_months/,Success Story: 60 pounds down in 8 months,"Hi all,

I wanted to share a success story. I lost 60 pounds in 8 months, going from 210 lbs down to 150 lbs. It‚Äôs been a complete turnaround in my life.

Before this year, I had a gym membership but almost never went. I tried many times in the past to get into it but never stuck with it. Then something personal happened at the start of the year that flipped a switch for me and I finally had the motivation to commit.

I started using the Lose It app to track everything and paired it with going to the gym 6 days a week. My routine was one hour of lifting weights followed by a 30 minute incline walk. I took one rest day where I did no gym and no walking.

A few things I learned along the way:

* Weigh all your food when you can.
* I never ate back my exercise calories. I‚Äôm not sure this was the best thing but it helped me hit my goal. Now that I want to gain muscle I‚Äôll probably change that.
* My average loss was 1 to 2 lbs per week which was a little fast and probably cost me some muscle.
* Daily weigh-ins showed me how much weight can swing from food and water. Salt especially had a big effect. Looking at the trend was always more important than the day to day number.
* I started taking creatine about 4 months in to help keep my muscle.
* Consistency was everything. I never missed a workout and I ate simple meals that I still enjoy now. Same breakfast every day, protein with salad for lunch and dinner, and I saved some calories for a protein bar and coffee in the afternoon.
* On weekends I sometimes had an ice cream or dessert. When I ate out with friends I estimated the calories as best as I could and picked the best option for protein and calories.
* Calories don‚Äôt count on your birthday.

I'm grateful to read some posts in this thread during my journey that helped keep me motivated.",6,1757286732.0,loseit,0,0.8,False

# First Communications

When i was a little girl, i loved to play, Monster High, Ponies, Polypockets, Barbies, but I had no one to play with, dad was always at work and all my mother cared about is if i had my chores done or homework done, all i had when i was younger, was Mia. Mia was a comforting figure at first, even though she never spoke, she always wanted to play. At first I thought she was my reflection, but soon I realized she was her own person. Whenever she held up my dolls three the mirror, my toys being lifted right before my eyes, I knew it was time to play. I used to think it was so cool that I had my own invisible friend, that no one else could have but me, but as I got older it got more scary. I used to try to show my Mother one day. ‚ÄúMommy look! I have a mirror friend!‚Äù I exclaimed at the ripe age at six when i start to see her, pulling my mother to my room and in front of the mirror that was attached to my walk in closet ‚Äúwow, honey, its so cute how you're starting to have imaginary friends‚Äù My mom says and she pats my little head, even child me could tell she had some doubt in her voice. After that I was starting to be left alone to play by myself more. I used to draw family pictures a lot, I used to include her, and soon it was just drawings of me and Mia.¬†



I was starting to get closer to Mia emotionally, as my parents were no help in that department. I found myself telling her everything, but in elementary everything started to change. I spent more time away from her, gaining friends through second and fifth grade. I never played with her much during those years unless I was home alone. I used to go to sleepovers and hangouts at their houses, and I always said no one could come to my house. That was until the group projects. The final project in my fifth grade, and it was a fun one. I got paired up with one of my more popular friends Celo, it was an art project and I loved to draw, it also gave me a chance to be close and in touch with the popular girls, so it'd be perfect, I thought at the time, i wish i could stop little me from making the worst mistake in my little life.



She wanted to work at my house, and for once, I agreed. So on the day she rang the doorbell. ‚ÄúComing!‚Äù I shouted at the door running with excitement, greeting her and letting her in we went down the hall to my bed room and once she goes in my room she places this big white poster and a laptop on my be she says ‚Äúokay, here's the plan, i do the work and research and you do the tables and-‚Äù She stutters, and freezes. I tried to cover my mirror with my small body but the taller girl already saw it ‚Äúdid ‚Ä¶you make that? you're really impressive!‚Äù Celo said joyously, probably having more confidence in my drawing skills that I actually had. Mia felt more simple in her appearance this time, sitting with her white gown draped over her knees, her head down where you can only see her hair. I just went with it, I didn't expect anyone else to see Mia, she looked and felt different this time though, even i at that time felt spooked even when she was so familiar in my life at that point.



The work was going well at first, I was drawing the poster first and while I was finishing the outline, I heard Celo on the other side of my bed scream, looking up I saw a look of horror on her face, I can't forget it even now it was the most terrified I've ever seen a little girl ‚ÄúWhat the-, look what is that, RACHEL what is that!?‚Äù I get up as quick as i could and turned around too my mirror and see mia, now above us in the mirror like she was in the room, she even felt in the room like her presence was there, and more dark energy, not like how she is with me alone, it was scary to me, but she was also so familiar to me, i felt confused and frozen, so i said what i knew, ‚Äúthat's Mia‚Äù I murmured under my breath and Celo just gives me that terrified look and says ‚ÄúHow are you so calm you freak? i can't be here‚Äù Was the last thing Celo says, taking her laptop and running out of my house



I tried to run after her ‚ÄúI'm sorry, i cant- I can make her stop, i'll tell her, ill, I'm sorry!‚Äù I yelled in a panic quickly gathering her stiff and running through my hallways and felt the front door being shut while my body crashed into it while chasing her and landed me on the floor, and all I could do was sob, curing¬† myself into a ball on the cold living room¬† floor and just cried until I passed out. I woke up in the middle of the night on my bed, the project poster rolled up next to my mirror. Knowing dad must have put me on my bed as he found me asleep on the couch and floor before, but all I could think of was Mia, and how angry I was at her, the first time I've been this angry at her. I turn my light and walked over to my mirror sitting and say ‚Äúwhat the HEll Mia, why did you do that, i cant- i mean you RUINED my chances of‚Äù I stuttered while my anger turned into sadness ‚Äúfriend- who knows who she can tell or what she will tell, Mia, please, why..?‚Äù. I started to hit my mirror, of course not strong enough to break it, but it left some marks. I then heard a little voice in my head say ‚Äú*i can be your friend again‚Äù* I jolted away, was that Mia? Yea, it was Mia. I thought to myself that no, I'll never be her friend again after what she did, so from that day forward I ignored her even more.  


# Troubling Things

When I came back to fifth grade after that day I was a complete loner, everyone called me ghost girl as rumors of my haunted house grew even more, people thought i was either super weird, or super creepy. As the summer came and went by and 6th grade rolled around, Everyone forgot about it, about me, which was great, i got to start over. I started to go out, found some outgoing friends so I wouldn't be in my house or room so much. My parents didn't seem to care much, they met all my friends when one of my friends hosted a birthday dinner at her house. My bedroom became a place where I can sleep, and just sleep. Seventh grade is when I used to sneak out. Then i heard her again, ‚Äú*Where are you going?‚Äù* I heard mia, again after a full year of my closet opened, decorated, full of clothes, with a bright night light. I slowly closed it again, and saw mia. It's like she grew up, like me, the same age, but with the same damn hair and gown. ‚ÄòNo, im ignoring this‚Äô i thought to myself and slammed it back closed, but once i did that i felt a hard tug in my backpack i was gonna bring.



Freaked out, I quickly climbed out of my opened unlocked window and closed it quickly. I felt so unsettled that night with a mix of seeing that terrifying ghost girl in my mirror again, a part of me was hoping I was just imagining this, then a rush of Celo came back to me. I'm so glad i have other friends that accepted me, and not so curious about my house, i can just go to theirs. One day in the middle of free time in class, one friend, Lila, suggested it. ‚ÄúHey why haven't we gone to your house yet, you said yourself your parents are barely there so it'd be perfect‚Äù, Straight out, just like that, i never expected that question much less prepared an answer, ‚ÄúI-well i never thought of, that uh, well-‚Äù, ‚Äúoh leave the poor girl alone, she's clearly uncomfortable with that, why do you think she never suggested it hm?‚Äù Serena said defensively ""jeez i was just asking‚Äù Lila said with an annoyed but apologetic tone. A mixed feeling came over me. I'm not a little girl who needed to be protected, but at the same time, she just saved my ass from a lot of stuttering and failed explaining.



From that day on, Serena was the most understanding person in my life. Talking to her made me feel calm, and understood, but not close enough to talk about Mia just yet. There was something different about Serena that she saw in no one else, even inviting only her to her house, of course only hanging out in the living room. One day while Serena walked past my room to the restroom, when she got back, she told me ‚ÄúYour room feels heavy‚Äù. I had no reaction or no comment to that, and Serena, like always, respected it. That night I checked on Mia, she became a pet I needed to check on once in a while. Once I closed the closet again, she was there, crisscrossed sitting like how she did before, but turned around, like she was angry at me, ignoring me now. I wish I understood Mia more, but a part of me was terrified to even talk to her again. I never got a good rest in that room but this night was unbearable. So I went to sleep on my couch. I did that a lot since my room's energy became more negative.¬†



Things got better at school. I loved that place, I loved the tests, the notes, I was so smart, and I kept up with my appearance, so sooner or later, I met Jake. He was my partner in English around the start of eighth grade, and it's like Deja vu. We got a pair for a project. But this time it was different, we didn't go near my room, we did our project in the living room, we bonded over our shared skills in art and history knowledge, nailed that project together, after we presented and left class, he kissed me, it was the happiest I felt in my life. After we dated, for the best four months I was head over heels for this guy. Eventually he confessed that he knew me as the weird ghost girl in elementary school, but he told me he'd still love to go to my house even if it was haunted. I didn't confirm his suspicions on if it was haunted or not, but I did tell him I'd take him to my house.



On a Saturday when my parents were away in the morning, I invited Jake to my house. When i answered he hugged and kissed me, looking at me with such admiration in his face ‚ÄúLove, i'm so happy you're so comfortable enough with me in your house now, and don't worry you don't need to take me to your room, we can hang out here look‚Äù He took out some DVDs ‚Äúi got us movies we can... watch while we hang out on your couch‚Äù He tells me with a giddy grin on his face, i quickly grab his hand and lead him too my living room, ‚ÄúI really appreciate you honey, your perfect‚Äù i tell him in a sweet tone, while he goes to my DVDs player underneath the coffee table that my TV sat upon. When the movie was in he instantly came to my side, pulled me close, i felt in heaven, kissing angelic lips and being in the arms of who i felt was an angel. After the second movie started i started to feel myself drift off to sleep in jake's arms ‚Äúbabe, we can take a nap in your room if you want, i see your really enjoying these movies‚Äù i smile with that suggestion and nod as i sit up from couch ‚Äúonly if your, sure tho i know you feel uncomfortable with people-‚Äù I shut him up with a kiss and grab his hand as i stand up ‚ÄúIt's fine. Really,i‚Ä¶trust you enough‚Äù I said happily, hiding the unsureness I really felt but I really wanted to be so close to him, maybe, Mia wont act up this time.¬†



We entered my room and I quickly checked to see if the closet was closed, thankfully it was. He went on my bed and leaned against the wall, patted his lap and said ‚Äúlet me be your pillow‚Äù. I smiled and squealed as he said that quickly went over and layed on my head on his comfortable lap. All I could focus on was his face though, I grabbed his back of his neck and pulled him in for a kiss, a deep, passionate kiss, then more, and more. Feeling his body turn and gently get on top of mine and then, ‚ÄúHey.. did you just, hit me in the head?‚Äù that question made my heart sink to my stomach, i quickly sat up as a result he sat up too. I looked around seeing one of my little toys i keep on my nightstand on the floor near my bed, and then see another violently get tossed his way i try too block but, end up falling on the floor and his head end up getting hit anyway ‚ÄúOuch hey, what the-‚Äù then another, and another, quickly seeing as he was blocking his head, I as quick as i could went to my nightstand and blocked the objects ‚Äúwhat the fuck rachel, is this the haunting that everyone was was on about, i thought that shit was made up‚Äù he said sitting up from my bed and i said ‚Äúi, im so sorry it was never like this, lets just go back to the living room i swear itll, ill‚Ä¶‚Ä¶jake?‚Äù he looked terrified, I got flashes of memories of Celo, making that exact same face, frozen in fear and confusion. I turn back, seeing the wooden nightstand float amongst us. Jesus, I've never seen anything like this.



¬†¬†¬†Jake ran to my door and I ran after him but that's when the table crashed and crashed into his body and saw him fall onto the floor and acted as quick to pick it up and toss it to the side and off of him. He stood quickly but can tell his arm got injured, seeing his hand grab his severely bruised arm. ‚ÄúIm sorry ill make Mia stop, ill im¬† so sorry‚Äù i try to reach for him and he smacked it away, me away ‚Äúget away from me Rachel‚Äù he tells me in the most serious tone i've ever seen him, i couldn't help but freeze, see him leave my room, and hear a slam out my front door. All i could do was cry, again, Mia ruined i.

# Final Encounters

Devastated, broken, breaking down is how i was after that, that night i tried to throw my nightstand that was just floating that day, at the mirror ‚Äúfuck you Mia!, why wont you just leave me alone‚Äù I say repeatedly slamming the small table into the mirror,¬† trying to break it in a hope that deep down if it did break Mia would be gone,¬† no matter how i hard, fast, or roughly i threw and slammed that damn table onto the mirror. ‚ÄúGODDAMMIT Mia, Mia please if you hear me, please, leave, me, alone‚Äù i say as a pleading feeling my weak and tired body fall to the floor, looking at Mia at her level, her head and body is still turned around to me, and she said nothing. I slammed my closet door back open, went to my bed and slept and it was like a blink, morning again.



This school day was horrible, but worse thing, Jake told everyone I made that bruise. On my locker I found words scribbled on it with sharpey, ‚Äòabuser‚Äô ‚Äòfreak‚Äô and worse of all ‚Äòghost girl‚Äô. Everyone, even my friends, ignored me. At lunch I decided to talk to Jake. Seeing when he was by himself on the bleachers in the gym, ‚ÄúJake, under the bleachers, now‚Äù I said seriously and walked to be under the bleachers. Waiting for him felt like an eternity but he finally showed ‚Äúwhy did you tell everyone some fake news, i didn't do shit to you and you know it‚Äù i said pointing accusingly at him, then he smacked my hand away, i never left so heartbroken and angry in my life. ‚ÄúYou did, or if you didn‚Äôt , ‚ÄúMia‚Äù did‚Äù my heart sinks and eyes widen ‚Äúyea, i heard you, you know this thing, that attacked me, why didn't you tell it to chill, or tell me, this is something you know the fuckin name of, thats crazy, people are safer away from you don't you think‚Äù, ‚ÄúNo, NO she is not apart of me, and you heard those rumors, you SUGGESTED to be in my room- look I'm, sorry i am, but please dont make everyone against me, everything was going so well‚Äù I look at him with desperation, and all he done, is shake his head ‚Äúyour crazy Rachal‚Äù was all he said, i really didn't get it, i dont get why he said that. That was the moment I lost, almost everyone.¬†



Back home all i could do was be by my lonesome, focused on doing some homework just anything, to distract myself from this devastating reality i needed to come to terms with living. When i hear a knock, but i was paranoid until i heard a familiar voice ‚ÄúRachal, it's me, open up girl, i know what everyones saying, i tried to defend you girl i promise i tried‚Äù I quickly open the door and hug my friend ‚Äúserena, oh thank god please come in‚Äù i say and take her hand and we both take seats in the couch, i quickly go to her side and cry, cry it out with her as she hold me in her arms now, it felt much more, safer then jakes, since i know she will stick by my side through everything. ‚ÄúLook, i know you, i knew you'd never do that, jake told us that you made that brise and blamed it on the ghosts‚Ä¶but i need to know what happened‚Äù I instantly sat up so quick and instantly explained ‚Äúi didn't, mia did, she's in my room in my damn mirror, and and, she was hitting him and my table she she did it all she made that bruise please, you need to believe me‚Äù i said getting more desperate as it was so hard to explain without oversharing and sounding sane, ‚Äúshh, shh it's okay, i believe you, i can tell, i can tell by how your reacting and, feeling your- not a liar‚Äù i feel comforted by those words, ‚ÄúYour the only one who thinks on not crazy, thank you‚Äù i say while letting my head fall on her shoulder ‚Äúi'm so exhausted from it‚Äù closing my eyes and feeling mas gentle head caress my hair and finally able to breathe, normally again

Then I open them

And she was gone, everything was gone, and pitch black,, I got up quick from the black floor in a panic, ‚ÄúSerena!?‚Äù I exclaimed, looking around, back, left right, everywhere and nothing, no where to be sound, but I notice a little light ‚ÄúHELLO‚Äù I start walking forward and I start to realize, it‚Äôs, a room

Walking closer and closer, it's my room, it‚Äôs my body with my friend with my head in her lap, but it wasn‚Äôt me, it was, Mia.

I have a second hand bdb v1 with steam issues I can‚Äôt figure out. my steam is intermittently very weak or non existent. On rare occasions it is normal strength. 

I have changed all steam orings, steam valve service and after this I can hear the pump filling for 2 min after drain, heats to 150c, water fill probes all showing full, and when I drain steam boiler after a while a large amount of steam comes out of the boiler. I‚Äôve checked all the work I‚Äôve done no issues, no scale blocking pipes going into top of boiler. I‚Äôve taken the steam assembly apart and blown through it and blown through pipes going from the steam boiler and they seem clear.

I‚Äôm thinking there is a coffee pump issue because the preinfusion is very weak and takes a while so planning on changing this pump and swapping opv. Does anyone have any ideas an about potential causes? I‚Äôve scoured the home barista forums with no luck.

TL;DR: Perfection felt like safety.. grief and AVPD seem to pull me back to ritual. Seeking concrete practices that make ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù feel safe

So here's something I wrote recently. I've been trying to expand outside of the doom and gloom I normally write



We wake up early, before the light has really settled. We creep into Mommy and Daddy‚Äôs room, whispering good mornings while our eyes are still heavy. Mommy gives us hugs, then disappears into the bathroom, her orbit already starting. Daddy begins to hum the same song he always hums, the one from when he was a kid.. our little morning anthem. We mumble our own version under our breath, half-singing, half-chanting. It isn‚Äôt just a song anymore. To us it feels like part of the morning, a chant tied to the ritual of the bed. The rule.

Daddy pulls the sheets tight, tugging the wrinkles out until the fabric is flat. ‚ÄúIf the bed is right, the day is right,‚Äù he says, like he always does. We watch closely, because there are rules inside the rule. The line on the side can‚Äôt be wiggly. The pillows have to be soldiers, standing tall with no slouching. If the sheets aren‚Äôt perfectly flat, Daddy smooths them again and again until they finally behave.

When it‚Äôs perfect, he pats the blanket once, and that pat feels like a medal pinned to our chests. Then he squeezes our shoulders, warm and heavy, before announcing the next step of the morning: ‚ÄúCheerios and fruit, time to boogie.‚Äù



Breakfast on perfect-bed mornings always begins the same way. Daddy slides our bowls across the table so they bump to a stop right where they belong, as if the table itself knows the routine. Milk first or cereal first? That‚Äôs the question every day, and it feels more like a password than a choice, the way you open the morning properly. If we say milk, he laughs and calls us crazy, crazy enough it might just work. Then he pours it slow, almost like a magic trick, before letting the cereal rain down after. Sometimes he even makes us taste it, just to see if the cow made a good batch. The game never changes, and that‚Äôs what makes it feel safe.

Mommy always gets a kiss on the forehead, the bed always gets its pat, and those are the signals that everything is in order. Without them, the morning feels incomplete, like we‚Äôre waiting for the green light that hasn‚Äôt turned yet. Then comes Daddy‚Äôs smile. Wide enough to let us know we did things right, but not wide enough to reach his eyes. We wait for it anyway, patient and still, because the smile means go.

When the bed is perfect, the house is perfect too. The fridge shuts with the same soft thump. The radio hums the same songs as if it never gets tired. Sunlight stretches across the table in golden lines that always fall in the same places. Everything hums along in its rhythm, quiet and steady, like the whole house is breathing with us.



This morning feels different before we even leave our beds. Daddy isn‚Äôt humming. He doesn‚Äôt come into our rooms to squeeze our shoulders or pat the blankets the way he usually does. Instead, his voice is flat and hurried: ‚ÄúGet dressed, guys. We gotta hurry today.‚Äù It‚Äôs enough to tell us something has slipped, even if we don‚Äôt know what.

When we peek into his room, his bed is still messy. The corners aren‚Äôt sharp, the pillows aren‚Äôt standing like soldiers. Mommy makes it instead, but it doesn‚Äôt look the same. She pulls the blanket up and smooths it once, maybe twice, but there‚Äôs no precision, no repeated tugging until the sheets lie flat. She doesn‚Äôt pat the bed when she‚Äôs finished either, and the absence of that gesture feels louder than the sound of her footsteps leaving the room.

Breakfast is different too. There‚Äôs no milk-or-cereal-first game, no bowls sliding across the table like pucks on a rink. Mommy or Daddy just pours the Lucky Charms, then the milk, quick and silent, no jokes, no taste test. The radio stays off, the kitchen quieter than usual, and without the hum of music the silence seems to stretch across the whole house.

We whisper about it over our cereal, voices small like we‚Äôre sharing a secret. Daddy had a tough sleep. Maybe work is bad. He didn‚Äôt make the bed today. Maybe the house will be mad. Nothing is wrong, not really; the food still tastes good, the day still moves forward, but something is missing. And when you‚Äôre a kid, missing things can feel as big as broken things.



We start to notice the little things. When Mommy makes the bed, the corners aren‚Äôt as tight. The pillows don‚Äôt stand like soldiers. The blanket looks fine, but not the same; good enough for her, never quite good enough for him.

On those mornings, Daddy isn‚Äôt as silly. He doesn‚Äôt squeeze our shoulders or hum the song. Sometimes he just sits at his computer with a mug of coffee while Mommy walks us to the bus. He isn‚Äôt angry, just quieter, further away, like he‚Äôs already halfway gone before the day even begins.

We whisper our logic to each other: the house doesn‚Äôt like messy beds. That‚Äôs why Daddy forgets to laugh, why the kitchen is too quiet, why breakfast feels like just food instead of a game. It isn‚Äôt punishment, not really. It‚Äôs distance. But distance feels bigger when you‚Äôre small.

Mommy has her orbits too. If our lunchboxes don‚Äôt have a Hershey kiss, we say it means she forgot us. If we don‚Äôt get her morning hug, it means the day started wrong. But even when she slips, the bed is still perfect, and that keeps the world steady. And sometimes, on the rarest mornings, we get everything just right; tight corners, hugs, kisses and songs.. and those feel like the best mornings the house can give.



Some mornings Daddy isn‚Äôt Daddy. He‚Äôs a big person instead. Big people sit at desks with coffee cups and stare at screens. Big people don‚Äôt notice the beds we made, don‚Äôt sing along to songs, don‚Äôt ask about milk or cereal first. Big people talk shorter, like words cost too much.

We tell ourselves tomorrow will be better. Tomorrow he‚Äôll be Daddy again. But some mornings stretch too long, and it feels like maybe tomorrow won‚Äôt come.

Now we check the beds like they‚Äôre forecasts. If Daddy is still tugging at the sheets when we wander in, it means a good morning; humming, jokes, maybe even dancing in the kitchen. If Mommy makes the bed instead, we laugh with her, but we wonder why Daddy didn‚Äôt. Did we do something wrong? Were our corners not tight enough?

The whole house feels heavier on those mornings. The rooms are either too quiet or too loud in the wrong ways; the fridge buzzing like a growl, the floorboards creaking without rhythm, no radio to soften the edges. Mommy packs our lunches without Hershey kisses, and we notice. Kids always notice.

We don‚Äôt know the word for it, but we feel it: the dark. It sits in the house when Daddy isn‚Äôt himself, when the bed isn‚Äôt made the right way. And we don‚Äôt know what to do with that dark, except to hope the corners are sharp tomorrow.



One morning we wake up and Daddy‚Äôs side of the bed is empty, messy, the sheets still warm but not tucked in. He‚Äôs already at the computer. We creep into the room expecting silence, but the radio is playing, and Daddy is singing along; real songs this time, mixed with silly ones he makes up about the dog and the cat next door. Mommy sighs and straightens the bed her way. No shoulder squeezes, no tight corners, no pat at the end. But the morning doesn‚Äôt break the way we thought it would. It bends, and bending feels lighter than breaking.

Breakfast is different too. Lucky Charms instead of Cheerios, Eggos instead of toast. Quick things, messy things. No fruit tucked neatly on the side. No questions about milk first or cereal first. Just sugar and heat, Daddy lifting the cereal box and making it dance across the table until we laugh so hard we spill.

His smile looks different on these mornings. Wider, looser, messy, like the bed. Not the careful, practiced smile that waits for sharp corners, but something that spills over, untamed.

And the house changes with him. The windows let in more sun, even when the sky outside is gray. The floor creaks like it‚Äôs laughing instead of groaning. The walls feel farther apart, as if the house is making more room for us. Even the shadows don‚Äôt hide in the corners anymore. They dance.

It‚Äôs the first time we start to wonder if maybe messy bed days aren‚Äôt bad at all. Maybe they‚Äôre just a different kind of good.



We start noticing a pattern. When Daddy‚Äôs bed is tight, the day is tight too; everything lined up, everything on time. Cheerios in our bowls, corners sharp, smiles careful. The whole day marches like the pillows, standing straight in their row. But when the bed is messy, the day is messy too, and messy can be fun. Lucky Charms instead of Cheerios. Eggos dripping syrup. Daddy making up songs about the dog, laughing so loud the spoons rattle in our bowls.

At first we whisper it like a warning: messy bed, messy day. But after a while, the whisper changes. Maybe messy isn‚Äôt bad. Maybe messy is fun. Saying it out loud feels like breaking a rule, but it also feels like finding a hidden key we weren‚Äôt supposed to know about.

The first time we‚Äôre not afraid is the morning Daddy‚Äôs bed is left undone and he‚Äôs already in the kitchen, flipping waffles and singing off key. Mommy doesn‚Äôt even try to fix the bed. She just waves us over and says, ‚ÄúBeds can wait. Eat while it‚Äôs hot.‚Äù Daddy tells us to eat the marshmallows first, and for once, we do. On the walk to the bus stop, he lifts us up onto his shoulders, the air is crisp even if it bites cold. The world feels bigger, louder, brighter.

And the house feels different too. The walls stretch outward like they‚Äôre making more room for us. The floor creaks like it‚Äôs laughing instead of complaining. The fridge hums along with Daddy‚Äôs voice. Even the shadows stop hiding in the corners, they sway and dance. The house isn‚Äôt angry on messy days. It just breathes a different way.



One morning we don‚Äôt smooth our sheets. We leave the corners loose on purpose, pillows slouched like they‚Äôre tired too. It feels like breaking a rule, and the secret of it makes us giggle before the day even starts.

We run to Daddy‚Äôs room and dive into his unmade bed. The blankets are twisted into tunnels, the pillows toppled into piles. Our hair sticks out in every direction, wild with static, and our socks slide halfway off as we kick and wiggle under the covers. We pop our heads out, whisper secrets, then dive back in again until the room fills with laughter louder than we mean it to be.

Daddy leans in the doorway, pretending to frown, but his smile is messy like the bed. He crawls in after us, tickling until we shriek, then collapsing into the heap of blankets and pillows. For once, the bed isn‚Äôt about corners or rules. It‚Äôs about us, all of us, breathing together in the mess.

We still make our beds most mornings. But not always. Some days we leave them messy, to see what kind of day we‚Äôll get.",3,1757286384.0,AvPD,1,1.0,False

I figure RenPy could do the basic things like the gripe bubbles, interface, storing gripes, but the game also runs on a real-world clock where you check in every few hours or so (something I'm really not sure of).

Initially, I debated on posting about my Indigenous status because of, ironically, the topic of this post and how Chloe continues to encourage people to spread hate and shut down discussion of it. However, I do want to make it clear that reigniting discussion about this topic is not an attempt at being a white savior; I myself am mixed race and an Indigenous Mexican. Half of my family is currently being targeted by ICE and has always been subject to anti-Indigenous racism.

  


Many other Indigenous Americans, Canadians, and really founding people of any country spend their entire lives in fear of the government and justice system for good reason. The reason stories of the Indigenous women of Canada and America going missing, being violently assaulted and murdered fall on deaf ears, whole tribes going into hiding, assimilating, and stripping themselves of their cultures is a desperate attempt by the world to rid itself of its founding people to enforce authority, white supremacy, and to erase history. Whether you like it or not, this is still happening and will continue to happen until societies feel they have achieved total conformity and genocide. It is heartbreaking, terrifying, but a reality of prejudice and colonialism. That's the reality my family, many of my friends, and my loved ones have lived their entire lives. I am blessed to be as white-passing as I am because I know if I wasn't, I'd easily be in their position.

  


At the time this really took off and got the attention and backlash it deserved, I was disgusted but assumed that Chloe was ignorant and not malicious (which is not an excuse). However, Chloe has talked plenty about her 'coffee', 'not dark but a lovely tan' colored friends, so I find it quite hard to believe she was not around and got just a glimpse of racism being perpetuated against the people she loved. That is what makes this situation all the more infuriating.¬†

  


Not to mention, violence and sexual assault against Indigenous American women was at an all time high in 2018, so much that an entire report was urgently written and published by the UIHI:¬†[https://www.uihi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Missing-and-Murdered-Indigenous-Women-and-Girls-Report.pdf](https://www.uihi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Missing-and-Murdered-Indigenous-Women-and-Girls-Report.pdf)

  


Whether you like it or not, the topic of this post was a disgusting display of ignorance, prejudice, and reckless; racism from Chloe Wilkinson, and no amount of speculating over whether she has multiple personalities will change that.

  


I'll stop beating around the bush now ‚Ä¶ we're obviously talking about Nadia. Nadia was described by CW as an Afro-Indigenous¬†¬†teenage girl in an extremely defensive and derogatory manner. I'm sorry, but there really is no excuse for any of:

whatever this was supposed to be.¬†

  


'I have mixed skin, I'm quite dark, I have a much wider nose than this‚Ä¶ not as slender as Jade, but I'm very slender, willowy, have small boobs‚Ä¶ even the whites of my eyes, they're a different kind of white‚Ä¶'

  


'‚Ä¶I have a much, MUCH bigger mouth than this‚Ä¶ much bigger lips, Afro hair‚Ä¶ quite smooth for Afro hair, really wish it was like classic floof‚Ä¶'

  


Objectively, disgustingly racist and stereotypical. A white woman getting on screen to embody a racial caricature she's envisioned in her head, describing this black caricature as having a bigger mouth than hers, going into disturbing detail about this Indigenous, female caricature's body and how slender and small her body and boobs are, calling herself a black woman point blank period. I am sorry, but this was not advocacy in any way and I doubt anyone felt heard.

  


Listen, I am sympathetic to anyone claiming they have dissociative conditions and understand that how people may envision their parts/personalities to look may be drastically different to oneself. However, there is absolutely no excuse for describing what you believe to be a mixed, Indigenous black CHILD the way Chloe described Nadia ‚Äî for the few people that believe CW has DID, she has always had full creative control of her own channel and CHOSE TO POST a video of her alternate, dissociative personality describing herself with socioeconomic exclusive and extremely inappropriate stereotypical traits that get real Indigenous women raped and badgered to death. This was not a tweet, a post, what have you ‚Ä¶ this was an hour long, polished and edited video and Chloe chose to kept this sequence in.

  


Also, what kind of sicko laughs like a wasted hill billy going on about how small a teenaged girl's boobs are and how slim she is? I don't see anyone talking about how young Nadia was and how she got the same treatment as Chloe's 'Nina' persona, described as of the same age, which just furthers proves my point that Nadia was not just offensive, but dangerous. This was the objectification of a child, period.

  


If not to add insult to injury, she went onto to have Nadia given portraits by her rapist, pedophilic ex girlfriend:

There's nothing I could say that the diagram OP posted already hadn't other than the fact that, again, NADIA WAS SUPPOSEDLY SEVENTEEN. Why was Chloe having her dissociative personality that she describes as a young adolescent and claims was the result of severe, childhood trauma and exploitation in a skimpy feathered bikini top and a skirt that was cut above her kneecaps and showed off her ass? Why is she posed so suggestively in the head shot the same pedophile drew?

  


More over, Nadia was literally just an African Disney's Pocahontas. The types of feathers and 'wavy' clothing described on Nadia are identical to Disney's pornographic design, the ages, youthfulness, promiscuity, etc. I see no difference. I find it SO appalling that Chloe got away with this under the guise of it being how her dramatized interpretation of a condition she clearly does not have manifested in her day to day life.

  


What gets to me is the fact that people are still defending this, users of this subreddit included, and are being gaslit and made to believe they're unreasonable for finding a problem with this years later with extra aggression if the person voicing their thoughts is Indigenous. If we acknowledge how terrible of a person Chloe is and cringe at how one track minded she is, why can't we call this what it was?



I have seen people demean her racism countless times and tell people that they're reaching and just snarking. Like, no. Chloe had millions of subscribers including young impressionable children that thought this was okay and applied her racism and fetishism to their own malignancy and shut down other traumatized people who were mortified by the presentation and constant defending of Nadia. This is a person who pushes that Jews run the banks and alleges she is a survivor of fake abuse proposed by an antisemitic conspiracy theory that costed MILLIONS OF LIVES, ran her token black friend with real sexual trauma off the internet and called them a rapist, and still cries over having to get rid of this caricature and replacing her with a politically correct white nobody.

I remember that there is a stairway leading to a floor with a guard behind a desk and a locked room. In this locked room there is a empty cage/cube with cameras and some sensors monitoring it. There's also a guy working there, watching it. 

Then there's a girl who brings him coffee/lunch to the door and they are flirting I guess. One day he sneaks her in the room and whilst they're making out something appears in the cage/cube and, I'm really not sure of the ending, attacks them.

1nb7l5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1nb7l5m/even_during_withdrawals_my_focus_and_productivity/,Even during withdrawals my focus and productivity is MUCH better,"I'm beginning to believe that I have had an allergy to caffeine this entire time. Or I have some weird brain structure that rejects caffeine. 

I've been drinking caffeine for 5 years now at fairly high doses (300mg or so per day), and these five years have been absolutely abysmal for my productivity. I wonder why...

When I drink caffeine, I get an hour of this maniac energy. After the hour is up, I just feel like a zombie. I don't care about anything. I could have a deadline due the next day and just wouldn't give a shit. 

And if I attempted to ""re-fill"" and have another energy drink or tea or coffee during my crash, I would get zero energy back. Instead, I'd just feel anxiety.

I recently quit caffeine, and the withdrawals did suck, BUT even during the worst of the withdrawals my productivity and focus was \*infinitely\* better than whatever I felt on caffeine. 

During withdrawals, I had an awful headache for like three days, I felt genuinely sick, I didn't have any physical energy to workout, but I did not get the ""mental fatigue"" that I would get drinking coffee. 

Like even during my worst withdrawal days, my productivity was MUCH higher than any caffeine day where I drank more than 100mg of caffeine. 

I'm so happy to be off caffeine. But this whole withdrawal experience puzzles me. 

**Did anyone else experience these withdrawals, where you felt awful but paradoxically you were much more productive?** 

Something about caffeine completely incapacitated me these five years. Maybe a gene I have. Which is weird because I know so many extremely high-productive people that guzzle espressos down all day. ",3,1757286036.0,decaf,0,1.0,False
