I’m based in Berlin and working on opening a boutique Pilates studio here. Pilates has had such a huge impact on my life that I want to create a space where others can experience the same.

Right now, I’m still in the planning phase (I come from a business background and I’m studying Pilates certification as well). I’d love to connect with:

* People in Berlin who already practice Pilates 
* Instructors who might be open to sharing their experiences
* Anyone curious about Pilates or interested in joining a new community around it

Would love to hear from you, and maybe even meet up for a class or a coffee.

1nv0mgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyersNotes/comments/1nv0mgc/how_can_i_make_my_current_phone_battery_last/,How can I make my current phone battery last until the end of the day?,"https://i.redd.it/fizwhl2kzfsf1.gif

You know that afternoon slump where your phone hits 10% and suddenly you’re mapping out the nearest power outlets like a survivalist? I was there just last week, trying to stretch my battery for a bus ride home, and it felt like a high-stakes negotiation.



It’s funny how a dying battery can actually make you feel a little stranded. I started thinking about the iPhone 17 rumors, not for the camera or the color, but purely for the battery life. The talk is that the new A-series chip is built on a more efficient architecture, which is the technical way of saying it does more work with less power. It’s like having a car engine that’s both more powerful and sips gas instead of guzzling it.



The most interesting thing I read, though, was about the materials in the battery itself. Apparently, there's research into using silicon nanostructures in the anode, which sounds wildly futuristic. This could allow the battery to charge significantly faster and hold a charge for many more cycles before it starts to degrade. Imagine a phone battery that still feels new after two years—that’s the real dream, isn't it?



So while my current phone still needs a midday top-up, the idea that the next one might actually last from my morning coffee straight through to bedtime is what’s keeping me hopeful. It’s the simple freedom of not having to carry a charger everywhere.

I decided to venture down the ORB pathway for my fathers day (Sept 7th in Aus) gift this year as I haven't had a new brewer in a while and wanted to try it out... was getting bored with Aeropress? 

Anyway - I've been noticing that after my brew the ""puck"" that is left in the filter holder has a very uneven top surface, lots of hills & valleys - despite having levelled and tamped with the included tamp tool.   
My theory is that the water pour is doing this - with a bit of extra velocity through those dispersion holes where the stream initially lands from my kettle spout? 

I'm unsure if this is actually effecting the brew like it would on an espresso shot.

1nv08l3,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nv08l3/youll_see/,You'll See,"I never had many friends growing up. Most drifted out of my life within a school year, disappearing like leaves in a passing wind. My extended family was my only anchor against the tide of everyday life—until I reached a certain age. The cousins I once called dear friends, the ones I swore I’d never lose, grew distant as they pursued their own paths along life’s highway. I was left feeling a little lost, a little forgotten.

Most nights were filled with nightmares, the feeling of abandonment echoing through the chasms of my restless mind. I would sit up late, wondering where I was supposed to go next, what my purpose really was. Out in the world, it always seemed as if everyone else had already figured everything out—as if they’d woken up one morning with all the answers. Somehow, I never got that memo.

I tried school for a while, only to find it wasn’t for me. Not because I hated the classes, but because I couldn’t afford them. And even if I could, the atmosphere felt toxic, suffocating. With newfound freedom but no real purpose, I drifted toward creativity.

I drew for a while but found I was never much good—especially at the beautiful subtleties of shading. So instead, I turned to writing, approaching it with a wary mind. At first, I was dreadful; my words sagged and swelled, as shapeless as a marshmallow left too long in a microwave.

But over weeks and countless repetitions, something shifted. I began to make worlds—worlds better than my own. My writing room became my dungeon. In its darkness, shapes stirred and emerged from my mind—beautiful and sometimes deadly. They came alive and died on the page, right in front of my eyes. Smiles grew where longing once lived. The stories became my asylum. With pencil in hand, I built a lighthouse for my heart and soul. For the first time in a long while, I felt whole.

That was until the morning I woke from a daze at my desk, cheek pressed to my own words. A dark drool stain lingered in a pool on the mahogany surface beneath me. For a moment, the lines on the wall flickered—thin, ruled, like a giant piece of notebook paper stretching from floor to ceiling. I closed my eyes, shook my head, tried to blink it away. The vision obeyed, retreating into shadow.

I opened the door of my lair and stepped out of the dark chamber into a sunlit downstairs. I stumbled into the kitchen, yawning through the inner turmoil of a fatigued mind and a brain drained of ideas. I spent twenty minutes drinking coffee, pacing, staring at the black screen of the television. Finally, I decided it was high time to step outside—anything besides words, shadows, and the cramped curl of my hand.

But when I opened the door, I froze. This wasn’t my front yard. The lawn was gone, replaced by a stretch of pale earth and a crooked fence I didn’t recognize. Even the air smelled different—sweet and acrid, like woodsmoke drifting too close.

And the man standing there wasn’t my neighbor.

He looked almost like John Candy, broad-faced and cheerful in the wrong way, with a cigar clamped between his teeth. Smoke curled past his eyes as he tipped his head toward me.

“Howday, parr-diner!” he called, the cigar bouncing against his lip with each syllable. The cheer in his voice didn’t match the stillness of the yard.

The yard didn’t frighten me for long. In fact, the longer I stood there, the more it seemed… welcoming. The sunlight was warmer than any I remembered, the air cleaner, sweeter. Even the man with the cigar had a kind of charm; his grin was wide, his voice friendly, as if he’d been waiting just for me.

And the strangest thing was how right it all felt. The crooked fence, the smoke curling from his lips, even the earth beneath my shoes—it was familiar, yes, but in a comforting way. Like stepping into a memory I had always wanted, but never truly lived.

“You’ll get used to it,” the neighbor said, words soft now, soothing.

I believed him.

He reminded me of my father in a way; his tone was direct and heartfelt, softened by a humor that seemed to round the edges of the world. I knew that tone. I knew the way he held his shoulders, the way the smoke curled from his mouth like punctuation.

It struck me—not like lightning, but like a memory I had been waiting for. I had written him once. Not here, not now, but years ago, after my father died. I made a character out of grief: a man who looked like a comedian from old movies, broad-faced and approachable. He smoked cheap cigars, laughed easily, loved his wife, and found joy in the hum of an ordinary neighborhood. He was meant to be a placeholder for everything I lost—a man who could never die because I kept him alive on the page.

And here he was, standing on the other side of my front door.

“You’ll see,” he said, that grin never faltering. “It’s a good place. You’ll like it here.”

The words were so familiar I could almost picture the ink on the paper where I had first written them.

“You could stay here forever, son.”

The word son clung to me like smoke. It was a word my father had used to convey love in the most vulnerable, casual way.

I glanced at him gently, as if my father were alive again in another form. I couldn’t help but smile.

“I think I’ll take a walk down the road, if you’ll excuse me, sir.”

“No problem,” he said, like Nouh Probwem, the cigar still bouncing.

I smiled back, though the sound of his words left a faint tremor in me. Nouh Probwem. The cigar bobbed with the syllables, smoke twisting like punctuation marks that never belonged in the sentence. His grin held, unshaken, as if he hadn’t noticed—or as if it hadn’t mattered at all.

I stepped off the porch and felt the dust crunch beneath my shoes. The road stretched long and pale, curling into the horizon like a ribbon half-erased. Every step carried a comfort I didn’t trust. The air was lighter here, easier to breathe, as though the weight I’d carried my whole life had been peeled off and left behind in my old house.

Behind me, I felt his gaze, steady as sunlight on the back of my neck.

“You’ll see,” he called again, voice drifting like smoke. “You’ll see.”

I kept walking. The road was quiet—no birds, no cars, no insects. Only the sound of my own footsteps crunching in the pale dust. It was strange: the further I walked, the more familiar everything seemed, and yet I could not recall ever being here before.

A breeze moved across the crooked fence-line, carrying the faintest trace of ink and paper. Not woodsmoke anymore, but something dryer, more brittle.

The houses along the road were small and perfect, as though painted from memory. Curtains stirred in windows. I could almost make out faces, but when I blinked, they were gone.

Behind me, the man with the cigar still stood where I’d left him, a fixed point in this shifting place. Even at a distance, I could hear the scrape of his match as he lit another cigar.

“You’ll see,” his voice drifted, thinner now, but no less warm. “You’ll see…”

It occurred to me, with a shiver, that I hadn’t remembered closing my notebook.

The square ahead opened slowly, like a breath being drawn. The sun pooled in the cobblestones, turning them golden, inviting me forward. A woman leaned on the railing of a porch, her smile measured but not quite natural—too precise, too polished, yet somehow intoxicating. She tilted her head in greeting, eyes shimmering with warmth I felt creeping into my chest.

“Come,” she said, her voice a melody that wrapped around me. “We’ve been waiting.”

I hesitated, yet every instinct screamed that stepping forward would be… safe. And yet, it was thrilling in a way I hadn’t anticipated. The air thickened, fragrant with something impossible—flowers both real and imagined. My skin prickled, my senses drew me closer.

Every house, every tree, every face seemed designed to draw me in, to lull me into this perfection, this ease. The longer I walked, the more I felt that I belonged here, that I had always belonged here. And somewhere deep inside, a small, cautious voice whispered that perhaps I never would leave.

I followed the woman down the cobbled square, each step echoing softly in the warm light. Her smile never wavered, though it began to feel… too fixed, too deliberate, like the curve of a painted mask. She led me past more houses, more porches, each immaculate, each exhaling a quiet invitation I couldn’t refuse.

“You must be tired,” she said, voice soft and lilting. “Come, sit for a while. Refresh yourself.”

The chair she pulled out for me seemed impossibly comfortable, molded as if it had been waiting for my exact weight and shape. I sat, and the world seemed to shift: shadows around the edges lengthened and curled, never enough to obscure the light entirely. It was unsettling, but I could not look away.

“Do you like it here?” she asked, eyes locking on mine, the way someone might trace the edges of a photograph.

“Yes,” I murmured, though my throat felt dry. “It… it feels familiar. Safe.”

Her smile deepened, and I noticed how every motion seemed orchestrated to draw me in, to hold me captive in the moment. The air carried a scent of parchment and ink, like the pages I had left behind in my room. It made my chest tighten with a strange longing, a yearning I didn’t fully understand.

“You can stay,” she whispered, leaning slightly closer, close enough that the heat of her presence brushed my arm. “Forever, if you wish.”

The words wrapped around me like a velvet rope, soft and irresistible. My heart raced—not with fear, exactly, but with a dizzying desire to surrender. To let the perfection of this place, of these people, fold me into itself completely.

I wanted to speak, to say something—anything—but my voice felt fragile, as if it might shatter under the weight of perfection. I realized, with a creeping chill sliding down my spine, that every face, every gesture, every curve of the road had been shaped to coax me here. To draw me in.

And yet, even as the warmth wrapped around me, a tiny, sharp edge of unease pricked at the corners of my mind.

Somewhere in the distance, the man with the cigar lit another match. The tiny flare flickered, and I thought I saw him watching, always watching, the corners of his grin just a little too wide, his eyes too bright.

“You’ll see,” he called again, smoke curling like a question mark in the air. “You’ll see…”

I nodded, though the words made my stomach twist. Part of me wanted to trust him, to trust all of them, and part recoiled, knowing that perfection, no matter how comforting, often demanded its price.

And yet, I stayed. I could not move.

I shifted in the chair. It was soft, impossibly so, as if built around my spine. But the longer I sat, the heavier it felt. Not just my body, but my thoughts. They grew slow, syrupy, reluctant to form. My fingers twitched on the armrest like I was trying to remember how to move.

The woman with the perfect smile tilted her head. “Relax,” she whispered. “You’re safe here.”

Safe. The word rattled in my skull like a coin in a jar. It didn’t echo right.

I blinked, and for a moment the square flickered. The cobblestones dulled. Flowers lost their impossible colors. Faces blurred, smiles stretching too wide, eyes like smudges of ink. Only for a heartbeat—then everything snapped back, brighter than before, as if nothing had happened.

I gripped the armrests, heart thudding.

“What was that?” my voice cracked.

No one answered. The bowler-hatted man simply tipped his hat again, the same soft motion, but his hand trembled once before stilling. The little girl’s ribbon froze midair, then fell, limp and gray against her dress.

It was like watching a stage set misfire. A glitch in a performance I wasn’t supposed to notice.

“You’re tired,” the woman said again, voice still sugar, the pitch a fraction lower. “Stay. Rest. You’ll see it’s better this way.”

I turned to look for the man with the cigar. He was still there—only now he wasn’t smiling. Smoke poured from his cigar in a steady stream, thick and black, curling into words I couldn’t read before they dissolved. His eyes, still fixed on me, no longer looked warm.

The square dimmed again, just slightly. I smelled not flowers now but something sharper—antiseptic, like a hospital corridor. The “perfect” faces wavered at the edges like old photographs dipped in water. Voices layered, just a little too close together, like someone whispering lines from a script.

“You’ll see,” the man with the cigar said once more, but the velvet edge was gone now. Flat. Heavy.

I pulled at the armrests, rising slowly, my legs trembling under the weight of something I couldn’t name. The gentle warmth of the square now pressed against my skin, heavy as water. I wanted out. I had to move.

“Wait,” the woman said, stepping closer, her smile still wide, eyes sharper now, edges glinting like glass. “There’s no need to hurry. You belong here.”

I shook my head. “No—I need to leave.” My voice sounded distant, like it belonged to someone else.

The cobblestones beneath my feet shifted. Pale dust curled, then hardened into angles and edges that weren’t there before. Houses leaned, trees stretched unnaturally tall, the square folded subtly, like a page being creased. I stumbled backward, away from the woman, toward the road that had brought me here.

A chorus of voices rose, soft and insistent. “Stay… stay… you’ll see… it’s better this way…” Words wrapped around me like a net, warm and choking at once. I tried to run.

The man with the cigar was no longer a sentinel; he stepped into the square, smoke curling around him like living tendrils. His grin was gone. His face sharper, too wide, the shadow of his eyes hollow and dark.

“You can’t leave,” he whispered. The smoke formed letters above him, twisting and dissolving: NEVER LEAVE.

I ran, feet scraping the pale road, past faces flickering between warmth and blankness. The little girl’s bell-like laughter turned hollow. The bowler-hatted man’s hat floated off his head, tipping toward me mockingly.

A sudden wind whipped through the square, carrying the scent of ink, paper, antiseptic, and something metallic. The road stretched on and on, yet no horizon appeared. Every turn brought me back to the square, the chairs, the faces, the man with the cigar, waiting.

I screamed, but my voice was swallowed by the thick, pulsing perfection around me. My hands clawed at the dust, the air, the edges of reality itself. Then—

I woke.

My head rested on the mahogany desk. The drool stain gleamed dark in the morning light. The notebook lay open beneath my cheek, words sprawling across the page in a jumble I didn’t remember writing. The chair was empty. The air smelled faintly of paper and ink. Outside, the street, the trees, the hum of life—normal.

I never really knew if it had been real; the smells, sights, and details were almost too vivid for any dream. It was more like a memory—or a memory of a life I had never truly lived.

The recognition from the bowler-hatted man, the little girl who reminded me of my distant cousin, the man with the cigar echoing the father I had lost, the woman guiding me forward—they were pieces of longing, fragments of what I had wished for in reality, shaped into something tangible through my stories.

I realized then that when I write, I breathe life into absence. When I place a piece of myself into a story, I create a space that fills the void I carry. But the price is subtle, insidious: the worlds I make may call to me, may invite me to dwell within their perfection, where everything is warm, safe, and yet… not entirely real.

I closed the notebook and sat, looking at it for what felt like days. Everything I created was of intense passion and longing. Each story reflected the tribulations of my life or the things I missed. And in each, a world opened up, filled with recognition I had never received, affection I had never been given, and joy I had never known.

But I understood the danger now. Creativity is a mirror and a door. Sometimes, what it creates may want to keep you inside. And if you are not careful, you may walk into a sunlit square where everyone you have ever imagined waits—warm, welcoming, insistent—and you may never want to leave.

Trust me. You’ll see.

I’m 21F and recently moved to Pensacola. Since I’m still getting to know the area, I figured I’d put myself out there and try to meet some local friends. I’m not a big fan of Facebook, so Reddit felt like the next best place to reach out. (I’m open to other suggestions.)

A little about me: I love gaming, reading, cooking, and crocheting. I’d especially love to connect with people around my age (18–25+), particularly women and LGBTQIA+ folks.

I’ve noticed it’s tough to find a younger crochet group, so I thought it might be fun to start one. Nothing formal, just a relaxed space to work on projects, share ideas, and hang out over coffee or snacks. Even if you don’t crochet, I’d still love to meet people to hangout with or explore Pensacola together.

1nv04k7,https://www.reddit.com/r/videoeditinghints/comments/1nv04k7/adjust_video_speed_in_imovie_on_iphone_how_to/,Adjust Video Speed in iMovie on iPhone (How to),"# 

So… I’m that person who edits half of their footage from the passenger seat, on an iPhone, while juggling coffee and AirDrop. Speed-ramping beach drone shots, slowing down reaction clips, or making my dog’s zoomies look like an action movie – I do it all from my phone. Took me way too long to figure out what actually works – so here’s the messy, honest rundown of how to speed up a video on iPhone.

Let’s go.

# 📱 Step-by-step: How to Change Video Speed in iMovie on iPhone

**Step 1: Open iMovie and Create a New Project**

* Launch the app and hit that big plus sign to create a *Movie* project.  
* Select the clip you want to edit from your Camera Roll.  
* Tap “Create Movie” at the bottom.

This drops your video into a timeline. If it’s slo-mo or time-lapse, you might already see some limitations (more on that below).

**Step 2: Tap the Clip in the Timeline**

Once it’s selected, you’ll see a bunch of tools appear at the bottom. Tap the speedometer icon – yeah, that’s the speed control.

**Step 3: Drag the Yellow Slider**

Here’s the fun part: the slider with a turtle 🐢 and a rabbit 🐇.

* Drag toward the turtle: slow-mo.  
* Drag toward the rabbit: speed-up.

It goes from 1/8x (ultra slow) to 2x (double speed). Unfortunately, no keyframes or fancy ramping – it’s one flat speed per clip.

**Step 4: Trim and Split to Add Speed Transitions**

iMovie doesn’t support speed ramping, but I fake it by:

* Splitting the clip (tap the clip, then “Split”)  
* Setting different speeds for each part  

It’s not buttery smooth, but it gets the job done – especially if you cover the cut with a quick B-roll insert or transition.

**Step 5: Export** 

* Tap Done, then the Share icon, and export to Files or directly to your socials.  
* I export to Files for cleaner uploads (especially for Instagram Reels –trust me, the quality difference is real).

# ⛔ When iMovie Blocks You From Changing Speed

Here’s the kicker: if the original video is already slo-mo or time-lapse, iMovie might not let you change its speed. I’ve run into this quite a few times.

**Quick Fix for Slo-Mo Videos:**

1. Go to the Photos app.  
2. Open the slo-mo video.  
3. Tap Edit.  
4. You’ll see a white bar at the bottom showing where the slo-mo effect kicks in.  
5. Drag the black bars to remove the slo-mo –basically making the whole clip normal speed.  
6. Tap Done and *then* import it into iMovie.

Boom – now you can adjust the speed in iMovie like a regular clip.

If you’re trying to figure out how to speed up a video on iPhone camera roll without even touching iMovie, bad news: the Photos app won’t let you do that unless the video is slo-mo. For anything else, you’ll need to pull the clip into a proper editor.

What about time-lapse? No luck. iMovie doesn’t support changing the speed of time-lapse videos. Which brings me to my favorite workaround…

# 🔄 My Weird Workaround: Screen Recording

If iMovie blocks a video (time-lapse, weird codec, etc.), I:

1. Play the video full-screen in Photos.  
2. Screen record it at regular speed.  
3. Import the screen recording into iMovie.  
4. Now the file is “normal” and fully editable.

It’s janky, sure. But it works 9 out of 10 times. (Just mute the screen recording and maybe crop out the top bar.)

# 🚀 How to Go Faster Than 2x Speed in iMovie for iPhone

This one’s spicy because – spoiler – iMovie for iPhone caps you at 2x. That’s fine for casual edits, but sometimes I want something much faster. A sped-up timelapse of a 5-hour shoot, for example, or footage that just *feels* sluggish even at 2x.

Here’s what I do instead:

# 1. Export and Re-import Trick

* Set the clip to 2x in iMovie.  
* Export it.  
* Create a *new* project.  
* Import the exported clip.  
* Apply 2x again.

Now it’s 4x total. You can keep repeating this for 8x, 16x – as long as you’re okay with a bit of compression and minor quality loss each time. It's like speed stacking.

# 2. Use an External App

If you’re bumping into iMovie’s 2x ceiling, third-party apps are your way out.

Some that have worked for me:

– CapCut (solid for speed ramping)

– VN Editor (clean UI, no watermark)

– Movavi Video Editor (also does the job, especially if you’re already editing on desktop too)

It’s not a perfect fix – just a sneaky little workaround when you want to go faster without hauling out the laptop.

# 🎬 Alternatives When iMovie Feels Too Basic

When I need more than what iMovie offers – like for a clean Instagram Reel or a YouTube Short that actually looks edited – I usually go with one of these:

1. **CapCut**

 It’s free, beginner-friendly, and surprisingly powerful. You can ramp speed, get smooth transitions between slow and fast sections, and even auto-sync clips to music. The only catch? Free exports come with a watermark unless you’re logged in.

1. **Movavi Video Editor**

This one hits the sweet spot between simple and pro. It lets you go beyond 2x speed, handles smoother transitions between speed shifts, and even adds motion blur so your fast clips don’t look like a stuttery mess. I’ll jump to the desktop version when I want tight cuts or to match clips to audio, but the mobile app works great when I’m editing from the couch.

1. **VN Editor**

A lightweight, no-frills option with no watermark and solid speed control. It’s more advanced than iMovie, but not as packed (or occasionally chaotic) as CapCut – good for when you want clean, focused edits without distractions.

# 🧠 Final Thoughts

iMovie on iPhone isn’t perfect. It’s limited, a bit rigid, and can’t handle time-lapse or variable speed very well. But it gets the job done when you know how to work *with* its rules (or around them).

When I hit a wall, I switch to something a little more flexible – or, honestly, just screen record my way through it if I have to.

Have I missed a trick? Anyone else have weird speed hacks or iMovie workarounds?

What I’ve noticed, though, is that the coffee is fresh, aromatic, and tasty for the first few days, but then it slowly starts to lose its potency and becomes more rancid and acidic—especially with light roasts.

My question is: is there a way around this? I’m considering investing a significant amount in a nice home automatic espresso machine, but now I’m having second thoughts. Part of me feels like I should just order from the local cafés. There are a few good ones near my house, and I wouldn’t mind being a regular customer and supporting local businesses— and you get fresh coffee every day.

To put it bluntly: should I buy a high-end home espresso machine (budget isn’t a concern), or should I stick to ordering from local cafés?",2,1759297328.0,espresso,4,1.0,False
1nv03bt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nv03bt,New York city coffee haul,"Though New York city mostly has fast coffee which inherently makes sense because it is a pretty fast paced city, it does have some fab roasters, mostly around Brooklyn and Downtown. 

La Cabra:

Kamwangi-
From Kenya, washed. 
Notes: crisp and bright red berries 

I tried this, fairly acidic, could feel my glands twirl so really spot on, on the “crisp and bright” though, i love the after taste which is smoky and dark even though it is a light roast. 

Cachoeria-
From Brazil, washed
Notes: Chocolate and Stewed red fruit 

This has to be fav from the batch. Super clean notes. Not acidic at all. I couldn’t believe it. I think i found my comfort coffee. This was my first time trying brazlian coffee and I don’t think i am going to ever stop now. 

Manuel Domingo-
From Guatemala, washed
Notes: Strawberry and dark chocolate 

Second favourite. Super balanced cup. Slightly acidic but just enough to hit the spot. Coffee with notes of berry and chocolates have always made me keen. I honestly found this very refreshing. I think it would also make a solid iced pour over

SEY: ( also this is where i had the best flat white that has ever caressed my mouth)

They only had one bag for filter on sale when i visited. They are pretty much the best place in newyork for coffee. I wish i had a chance to visit it more often but they have an amazing slow bar. 

Anthony Kimani:

From Kenya, field blend, washed
Notes: blackberry, plum, star fruit, and rose

Apparently an award winning coffee from Kenya’s taste of harvest competition. 

My go to for an ideal fruity cup. I haven’t tried it a lot but i recall loving it. Will write a detail review and post it when i try it again. 

Black & White coffee roasters

From Santa Barbara, Honduras, natural

Notes: black cherry, orange, yellow peach, milk chocolate 

Super jammy. Probably the best jammy coffee i have had. Medium roast with fairly clean cup. This was the first bag of coffee i scored and was my everyday cup in the morning. Never disappointed. I could taste the flavours opening up every day. 

Single O:

Firecracker-

From Burundi, natural and washed

Actually, this one is from NSW, Australia. A friend of mine shipped it to me for my birthday lol

The taste says fruit punch but thankfully it doesn’t taste like i am drinking tropical fruit juice. Though it does blast in my mouth like a firecracker. Love the graphic on the bag haha. 

It was a huge burst of ripe fruit flavours and i love how it is balanced because it is a medium roast. I think this is perfect for an espresso. I need to take this bag to my local coffee place and pull one shot to post a review but the v60 from this was also delicious. 

That is all. Thank you!

Did you know? 👇

🟡 Espresso packs more caffeine per ounce 

 \~63 mg in a 1 oz shot.

🟡 Drip coffee delivers more caffeine per cup 

\~95–120 mg in 8 oz.

So while espresso feels stronger, your regular mug of drip usually has more total caffeine. ⚡️

Next time you need a boost, think about whether you want a quick kick (espresso) or a long-lasting lift (drip).",1,1759297073.0,u_OCOFFEEINC,0,1.0,False

I actually have four spin-off ideas that I would be interested in. They are all specifically P5 related but I think at least the one could work for P3... The first... a cooking sim... this is the one I think could technically work for P3 because Shinji is known for cooking... I suppose even P4 can work with Yu but... I don't think it is as defining of a trait... but... I suppose it could work... but yeah obviously it is because Ren is tied to Leblanc and cooking coffee and curry at least, they have Joker's Kitchen or whatever in P5S for example. So yeah it would take place in Leblanc of course. The second and this is kind of specific to P5, but even it is dubious but it is something I've never forgotten about since I first saw PV#1... a skating game, or ice skating is specifically what I had in mind... it could be something like Jet Set which... knowing there is a Jet Set reboot or whatever supposedly happening probably makes this unlikely... Joker (or a costume at least) will probably be DLC for it though which... I guess kind of works but eh... The third would be an Ace Attorney-like game with Sae considering Capcom will also never give us a new entry in that series why not get it from somewhere else like this. The fourth would be a water gun shooter kind of like that one Senran Kagura spin-off. A shooter but one that is more light hearted just seems fun to me. A more serious shooter could still work, but I dunno the water gun idea specifically is what sounds appealing to me. So yeah knowing they will never move on... these are some spin-off ideas I wouldn't mind them doing even if I would prefer that they did move on.

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I’m a final year undergraduate student in Canada who’s had a pretty difficult time getting my head on straight about where to take my career. I decided to specialize in accounting about a year ago, gave up in the middle, but am attempting to do it again to attain my CPA.

Do I like accounting? Not sure. I haven’t had experience, but I’m good with people and decent with numbers. Historically, I haven’t had particularly good grades in accounting-specific courses, but I’m not sure if it's due to a lack of interest in the course or a lack of ability. I’m trying my hardest this term to straighten out my grades, but I’m not sure if it’ll pan out. They hit the minimum CPA requirements, though.

I’ve tried networking quite a bit, setting up coffee chats, talking to lots of people in and around the accounting/finance industry to get a grasp of career prospects as well as try to land a job. I think I can take my career a lot of ways with a CPA, but harder to figure out what to do if that’s not the route I take.

While I have set my mind on getting to the CPA, I’m not even sure if I’m able to get an accounting-related entry-level job out of school. My low grades already take out Big 4 as an option, and a lot of small to mid-size firms reject me because of the same issue. I’ve built my resume decent enough + networked enough to land interviews, but grades usually are dealbreakers for the company, and I get rejected.

Do I continue on the path of being a CPA and keep trudging forward, or should I have a Plan B (not sure what that would be, start some kind of business that I’ve got no experience in? Do something else)? I’m in my final year and can only take on a moderate amount of risk based on my personal situation at the moment, but I really need to get some income flowing in as I finish my degree while setting myself up for some kind of future success.

I’d really appreciate you guys sharing your insights.",1,1759296494.0,Accounting,1,1.0,False
1nuzw0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1nuzw0a/m25_engagement_called_off_really_confused/,M25 - Engagement Called Off - really confused,"I’m 25M, software engineer from a metro city in TN. Recently my family has created profiles for me in some matrimonial websites and immediately they’ve received a match request from a 25F software professional from a non-metro city. (She was managing her account and was the one to convince her family to initiate conversation)

My family and her family were actively communicating through calls and we’ve invited her close relatives who are residing in our native to our home and had a good conversation and I’ve met her cousins and their families who were residing near my office for a coffee and we were chatting for hours like a longtime friends. Everything felt positive and went sooo good, both of our families started sharing a good bond before even starting the conversation with her. This was my first step in arrange marriage, the first match I got and it broke my arrange marriage anxiety. 

Both of our families decided a date for a meet and before that meet they’ve discussed everything regarding the next steps in call (engagement, wedding location, expenses planning etc.) so the ball is completely on our court, if we both liked each other they’d initiate the next steps immediately. On the first meeting itself our families were talking like they were long time friends and I’ve never seen my family getting along so easily with new people.

Finally I met her and we both had a good conversation and everything about her seemed very positive to me and she also felt the same. we had a lot of commonalities between us. I never thought I’d make decisions so quickly but we both conveyed that “we’ll almost say ok but still need a few days to come to a conclusion” to our family. 

So our families actually started discussing about the next steps actively and I guess they’ve even deactivated my profiles on the matrimonial platforms too.

In the meantime one day she casually asked me whether I drink liquor or not. It was completely a causal question she hasn’t even asked that in a serious tone. Actually I drink occasionally maybe monthly once or twice that too only when I’m with a few of my friends. Even my family knows about this and never asked or warned me directly since I know my limits and will always safely reach home and I’ll take care of my friends too when they’re drunk. I said this openly to her.

Right after knowing that, she immediately told me, her parents and family to hold this arrangements for sometime as she needs to reconsider her decision. She was behaving like she felt hurt or upset after coming to know that I’m a social drinker. When my family started reaching out to her family, we slowly stopped receiving active responses from her and her family and it felt like we are putting one sided efforts and they’ve lost their interest. I don’t want the situation to end up like this.

I directly reached out to her dad and he said “she has some trauma because of me, I used to drink a lot during her childhood days and that caused a lot of problems in my family, as she witnessed all those days she developed a fear to start a life with a person who has this habit”. Though everyone in her family tried to convince her by saying at least he was frank about it and that is casual these days, she wasn’t convinced. Her dad advised me that “you should’ve not revealed this kind of information about, I know you’re harmless but I’m unable to convince her” and said “I don’t know how to convey this to your family because I don’t want to create problems in your family”. He asked me to convince my family to call this off since he was not in a situation to face my family.

I really can’t come out of this situation. I can’t digest the fact that I lost a good match and a family just because I frankly conveyed that I’m a social drinker (I’m not justifying my social drinking habit but I have a lot of good habits other than that like I don’t skip going to gym and having a healthy diet etc.). My family was also very upset but they have not advised me for hours. They simply said “we’re happy that you haven’t lied”. 

But I feel like I should stop oversharing all the details to any of the match before marriage. Can anyone help me how to communicate and what details to be shared before getting married?",1,1759296487.0,Arrangedmarriage,7,0.56,False

You know how my phone charger has basically become a permanent fixture in my living room? I was untangling the cord for the millionth time yesterday and realized my phone now has two settings: tethered to the wall, or slowly dying in my hand. It’s a constant low-level anxiety, that little red battery icon.



It’s exactly that daily dread that has me so interested in the rumors for the iPhone 17. The buzz is all about a new, more efficient chipset, but the real game-changer I read about involves the battery technology itself. They’re supposedly moving to a stacked battery design.



Here’s the fascinating part I stumbled upon: a stacked battery isn't just one big power pouch. It’s like a stack of thinner, smaller batteries layered together, which creates more surface area for chemical reactions in the same amount of space. It’s the difference between trying to fill a room with one big balloon versus many smaller ones—you just pack more in. This could mean a significantly longer life without making the phone any thicker.



So, comparing it to my current iPhone 15, I’m genuinely hopeful we might finally get that ""all-day"" battery life that actually means from morning until you go to bed, not just until your afternoon coffee. It would be a small revolution, like suddenly finding a bunch of extra pockets in your favorite jacket. I might even be able to leave my charger in a drawer for a few hours.

You know how I’ve always been the designated photographer at family gatherings, right? For years, that meant spending almost as much time editing photos on my laptop afterward as I did taking them—tapping away to adjust the blur and the lighting until my coffee went cold. It felt more like a chore than a creative hobby.



This all changed completely when I started using the iPhone 17. I was skeptical at first, but its portrait mode is genuinely different. Now, I just point and shoot. The phone intelligently separates the subject from the background in real-time, applying a depth effect that used to require manual sliders. The best part? The results look like I’ve fussed over them for an hour, but it’s all done the moment I press the shutter.



What truly blew my mind, though, was learning how it works. I read that its new processor uses a machine learning model trained on millions of professional portraits. It doesn't just blur the background; it recognizes different types of hair, fabric, and even transparent objects like glasses, applying a nuanced blur that respects those edges. It’s like having a tiny, hyper-specialized photo editor living inside the camera.



So now, I actually enjoy being the family photographer again. I can be present in the moment, chatting and laughing, and still walk away with a gallery of stunning, ready-to-share portraits. It’s freed up so much of my time, and my family has stopped complaining that I’m always hiding behind a screen.

1nuzlh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Votann40k/comments/1nuzlh8/whats_purpose_of_life/,whats purpose of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1nuzkcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1nuzkcq/we_are_building_a_b2c_saas_to_automate_travel/,We are building a B2C SaaS to automate travel planning with AI. Would love feedback on our landing page and value prop.,"Hey r/SaaS,

I'm the founder of a new B2C SaaS called Travique, and I’d be grateful to get some feedback from this community before we launch.

**The Problem:**  
The core problem we’re tackling is the highly fragmented and time-consuming process of travel planning. The current user journey involves manually researching across dozens of blogs, review sites, and map applications, then compiling it all into a spreadsheet or document. It’s a huge friction point for a massive market.

**Our Solution:**  
Travique is an AI-native platform designed to be a ""personal travel intelligence."" Instead of users doing the manual work, our platform does it for them.

A user defines their ""travel DNA"" (interests, budget, pace, etc.), and our AI generates a complete, day-by-day itinerary from scratch. Key features include:

* **Genuinely Personalized Output:** It’s not a template. The AI crafts a logical itinerary with narrative descriptions, ensuring the plan is coherent and customized.
* **""Local's Handbook"" Integration:** We enrich the itinerary with insider tips (e.g., the best coffee shop near an attraction, photo spots, cultural nuances) that are hard to find.
* **All-in-One Interface:** The final output combines the schedule, an interactive map, and local insights into a single, clean UI, eliminating the need for multiple tools.

**Our Go-to-Market Strategy:**  
We are currently in the pre-launch phase. Our strategy is to build an initial user base through a waitlist, offering early access and a launch discount. The goal is to gather a cohort of beta testers to refine the product based on real-world feedback before rolling out a subscription model.

**The Ask:**  
I'm here to get feedback from fellow SaaS founders, marketers, and product folks. I'd specifically love your thoughts on:

1. **Landing Page & Value Prop:** Does our landing page at [**https://travique.co/**](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Ftravique.co%2F) clearly communicate the value? Is the ""Experience more, plan less"" message compelling?
2. **Monetization:** We are envisioning this as a B2C subscription or a per-trip pricing model. Do you see a viable business in this space?
3. **Potential Blind Spots:** Are there any obvious challenges or opportunities we might be overlooking?

I'll be monitoring this thread all day to answer questions and discuss. Thanks for your time and expertise",1,1759295354.0,SaaS,1,1.0,False

They seemed to enjoy the conversation we were having and were very engaged, and we stood outside the building for a few minutes talking.

1nuyyjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nuyyjt/no_women_in_blackwoodpart_1/,No Women in Blackwood(Part 1).,"If you’re reading this, I’m already dead. Right now, I’m climbing the spiral staircase to the topmost floor of the lighthouse at the edge of town. When I reach the lantern room, I’ll throw myself to the jagged rocks below. Better to be claimed by the sea than enslaved to that thing.

I am a 56-year-old man from a small seaside town in California called Blackwood. For the safety of my family, I dare not reveal my name. From this point on, I will only be known as Anon.

It was July of 1983, and I was fourteen — an age when most boys were sneaking beers at parties, chasing pretty girls, and fumbling toward their first real kisses.

But not in Blackwood.

Blackwood wasn’t like other towns on the California coast. The beaches were the same, the salt wind the same, but the people… they were relics, clinging to ideas long buried elsewhere. The town was damn near puritan. No music blasting from boomboxes at sunrise. No neon glow of arcades. No posters of Madonna or Michael Jackson. Even the games in our rec center were years behind — old Atari cabinets with pixelated beeps instead of roars.

Everything in Blackwood had a place. Every boy, every girl, a role. Boys were drilled in toughness, silence, obedience. Girls… well, girls were sent away to a special school, learning God-knows-what while we were left to stumble blind. I had never seen a girl older than eleven.

I grew up without a mother. My father was a deadbeat alcoholic who spent more time on the bar stools than at home. I hated him. My childhood smelled of stale beer, cigarette smoke, and the kind of silence that makes your skin crawl.

That day, I was with my friends at the abandoned café by the pier. Its windows were boarded, its paint peeling, the walls thick with mildew and old coffee — but it was ours. We passed a bottle of cheap beer around, laughing, killing time.

“Dude, this arcade game’s garbage,” muttered Vince, nudging the battered console Tommy had smuggled out of his garage. “I know,” I said, taking a swig. “It’s all just pixels. Who even likes these things?” “Your mom?” Tommy grinned. “Shut up,” I shot back, though I was laughing too.

We joked about girls we’d never had, movies we’d never sneak into, dares we’d never take. For a while, we felt free.

Then came the sirens.

Two patrol cars screeched to a halt outside, red and blue lights painting the café walls. “Shit,” Vince muttered, staring at the boarded windows as though they’d suddenly gone transparent.

The cops stormed in, flashlights slicing through the dark. “Everybody out! Now!”

We froze. Then bolted. Predictably, we didn’t make it far.

The night ended at the Blackwood police station.

“Why were you there?” the officer barked. “Trespassing. Underage drinking. You know the rules.”

We sat slouched in hard chairs, reeking of sweat and cheap beer. I tried to look bored, but my eyes wandered — and that’s when I saw her.

A girl. My age, maybe fourteen. Blonde. And pregnant. A belly no one that young should have. Her skin was pale, her eyes sunken, shadowed, like she hadn’t slept in weeks.

I whispered something crude under my breath, because that’s what boys do when confronted with the impossible.

And then she stared at me. Not at anyone else. Me. Her gaze burned through me as she walked forward.

“GET OUT!” she screamed.

I jolted upright, nearly leaping from the chair. The room spun.

The cop’s voice cut through the panic. “Hey! Sit down, kid. You fell asleep on me. Quit nodding off.”

I swallowed hard, my pulse hammering. The girl — gone, of course. Just a dream, I told myself. Just a dream. But the terror lingered.

This is the first woman I have ever seen. I never had a mother. I have never seen a woman past the age of eleven. After eleven, they just… disappear. There are no explanations, no reports. Just gone. It is as if the entire town chooses to forget they exist.

I questioned it when I was younger. It never went well. I was either gaslit into believing they never existed, or my dad would beat the foolishness out of me. And I went along with it. We were taught blind obedience from the cradle. So I learned not to question him. Or anything.

That night, I came home to chaos. My father stood waiting in the kitchen, a bottle in one hand, a belt in the other. His face red, twisted, drunk.

“You think you can wander off, drinking beer like some damn fool? Do you know how much trouble you’ve caused me, boy?” Spittle flew with every word.

I tried to explain, but he cut me off. “Don’t you dare open your mouth! You’ll learn respect the hard way.”

The belt cracked — once on the floor, then across my arm, then my back. Pain bloomed like fire. I didn’t scream. I never did. Not then, not ever.

“You’re nothing without me, boy! Remember that!”

When he finally stumbled off to drown himself in whiskey, I crawled to my room. My body throbbed, my ears rang, and her face wouldn’t leave me. The girl. Pale. Hollow-eyed. Pregnant. Her gaze burning through me.

Sleep came late, and when it did, it betrayed me.

I had no body, no face. I drifted above Blackwood like a shadow. The streets stretched endlessly. The small, square library pulled at me like a magnet.

Inside, the floor gaped open. A vast hole yawned in the center, blacker than night. From it rose whispers. All female voices — young, old, every age, every accent. Some soft, some sharp, some that seemed centuries old. They beckoned, pulling me closer.

I floated at the edge. Peered down. Saw nothing but endless dark.

And then I saw her.

The woman. Not a girl. Not a shadow. Flesh and bone and terror. She wore a hospital gown, its hem dark with dried blood. Her long black hair whipped in a phantom wind. Her skin was gaunt, death-pale. She stared at me, eyes burning with the same unnatural intensity.

“Row 15,” she rasped. Her voice cracked, echoing, layered with a thousand tones. “Bottom row…”

I tried to answer, to scream, but I had no mouth. Only thought. Only dread pressing into me like deep water.

Then I woke. Shaking. Sweating. The faint glow of a streetlight bleeding through my window.

Her words lingered. *Row 15. Bottom row.*

I didn’t know what it meant. I didn’t know what she wanted. I only knew that sleep had betrayed me, my town held secrets darker than anyone dared admit, and for the first time in my life, I felt utterly, irrevocably… alone.

The morning after that dream, I wanted nothing more than to scrub it out of my memory. I clung to routine like a life raft. Wake up, dress in the same jeans I’d worn two days straight, choke down burnt toast, and ride my bike through the misty streets toward Blackwood High.

The air smelled of salt and tar from the pier, the kind of briny sharpness that clung to your clothes long after you’d come inside. Seagulls wheeled overhead, crying at one another, and the gray clouds never seemed to move. Blackwood always felt frozen, like a painting that refused to dry.

School looked like it always did: squat, box-shaped, bricks mottled with salt stains. The flag out front sagged heavily and limply, never flying, just hanging there like a reminder of something long past.

My friends were already waiting by the bike racks, kicking at gravel, huddled in the damp morning like a pack of strays. Vince was chewing sunflower seeds and spitting shells into the dirt. Tommy had his denim jacket on despite the heat. Ricky looked like he hadn’t slept at all — but that was just his face. He always looked tired, like he was born that way.

“Dude,” Vince said as soon as I rolled up, “my old man nearly skinned me alive. I’m on lockdown until graduation.”

“Graduation?” Tommy laughed, bumping him with an elbow. “Try ‘til Jesus comes back.’”

Ricky smirked. “At least you guys just got punished. My dad gave me the sermon. Hour-long lecture about responsibility, about being a man, about ‘honor.’ I’d rather he just beat me and get it over with.”

I shrugged, forcing my voice to sound casual. “Yeah. Same here. My old man… you know.”

They did know. I never had to explain. The subject dropped, like it always did.

The day rolled on in the dull rhythm of Blackwood High. Math, history, English — all taught in classrooms that smelled faintly of chalk and seawater. The paint on the walls peeled like sunburnt skin. The clocks ticked louder than the teachers spoke.

Tommy got caught doodling rocket ships again and had to stay after class. Vince nearly started a fight with a sophomore over a bent quarter for the soda machine. Ricky fell asleep in study hall, head tipped back, mouth open like he’d given up on pretending. And me? I laughed at their jokes. I nodded along. I tried to be present.

But underneath it all, something was gnawing at the back of my mind.

It wasn’t a voice exactly. Not words. More like the feeling of being watched, or the pressure in your ears when you dive too deep. A hum at the edge of thought. And sometimes, when I wasn’t looking for it, the hum turned into a whisper. A direction. A pull.

Row 15. Bottom row.

I shook my head. Tried to focus on Vince’s story about sneaking into the theater to watch Return of the Jedi again. Tried to laugh at Tommy making fun of the new arcade machine at the rec center — “it’s like watching a brick jump, man!” Tried to sip the warm Coke from the cafeteria and let it fizz across my tongue.

But the compulsion was always there. A tug in the back of my skull, soft but constant. Like a hook in the water, pulling me closer, closer.

By the final bell, I was exhausted. Not just tired — worn down, like I’d been carrying bricks all day. The effort it took to push the thought back every time it surfaced left me heavy-limbed, head thick with fog.

I rode my bike home slowly, the tires crunching over gravel, my body on autopilot. When I finally staggered into the living room, the silence of the house wrapped around me. My father was gone — likely at the bar. For once, I was grateful.

I didn’t bother with homework. Didn’t bother with food. I just dropped onto the couch, my bag sliding to the floor. The cushions smelled faintly of beer and smoke, like everything else in that house.

The whisper still scratched at me, faint now, as though it knew I was resisting. But I pushed it down one last time. My body felt leaden. I closed my eyes.

And sleep swallowed me whole.

When I woke, it wasn’t in my living room.

It was dark. Too dark. The kind of dark that felt solid, pressing against your eyes even when they were open. For a moment, I thought I was still dreaming. My head throbbed, my limbs ached.

I sat up with a groan and hissed through my teeth. Stinging fire lit across my chest and arms. When I reached down, my fingers came away wet. Sticky. Warm. Blood.

Cold night air slid through broken glass somewhere above me, making the cuts sting worse. Moonlight bled in through a jagged window, a pale silver slash that cut across rows of shelves.

The smell hit me next: dust, mold, old paper.

The library.

I staggered to my feet, glass crunching under my shoes. My shirt clung to me, wet with blood. Cuts ran down my arms like I’d clawed through brambles. But I had no memory of coming here. No memory of breaking in.

And then, beneath the ringing in my ears, I heard it.

Not from outside. Not from inside. From everywhere.

Row 15. Bottom row.

The voice wasn’t louder this time. It was clearer.

And I knew, with the certainty of a nightmare you can’t shake, that I wasn’t leaving the library until I found it.

The library looked different at night. During the day, it was a sad, aging building — yellowed windows, a leaky roof, the kind of place teachers forced you to visit for book reports. But now, in the wash of moonlight, it seemed older, almost ancient, like it had been here long before the town itself.

Shadows stretched across the carpet, long and warped. The air was damp, thick with the scent of salt and rot, as though the sea had crept in and settled among the shelves.

My shoes crunched over broken glass as I moved, every sound too loud, bouncing off the high ceiling. I didn’t dare breathe too heavily. My cuts stung with every step, warm blood soaking through my shirt.

And underneath it all, the whisper.

row 15… bottom row…

It wasn’t in my ears. It wasn’t in the room. It was inside me, vibrating in my ribs, threaded through my pulse. Every time I thought I could ignore it, it sharpened, pulling my thoughts back like a leash.

The shelves loomed around me, tall, endless. Numbers stenciled in faded white paint marked the ends of rows. My eyes darted from one to the next. Eleven… twelve… thirteen…

The deeper I went, the darker it got. The moonlight only reached so far. Past the tenth row, I had to move by memory and the faint outline of shelves against deeper black. The smell changed too — less like dust, more like… mildew. Like something damp had been sitting here for years, festering.

Row fourteen.

I froze. My breath hitched. For a moment, everything was silent.

Then a creak.

Wood shifting. Not behind me. Not ahead. Somewhere between. The sound of weight settling on old boards.

“Hello?” My voice was too small, swallowed by the stacks.

Silence.

I forced myself forward, my hand grazing the edge of the shelves to keep steady. My fingers brushed over the spines of books, stiff and sticky with damp, their titles unreadable in the dark.

And then — there it was.

Row fifteen.

My chest tightened. The whisper surged, flooding my head until it was all I could hear.

bottom row… bottom row… bottom row…

I knelt, my knees popping against the thin carpet. The bottom shelf sat half in shadow, the wood warped and soft from water damage. Most of the books there looked ruined — swollen, mold-eaten, their pages fused together.

But one… one was different.

A thin black volume, its spine unmarked, wedged between two rotting dictionaries. It didn’t look wet. Didn’t look old. It looked new, like someone had placed it there just for me.

My hand trembled as I reached for it. The instant my fingertips brushed the cover, the air around me shifted. Colder. Heavier. The silence thickened until I could hear only my own heartbeat hammering.

I pulled the book free. The leather cover was slick, clammy, as though it had been pulled from water only moments ago. No title. No author. Just black.

And then, faint but undeniable, a sound.

Breathing.

Not mine.

Slow. Ragged. Coming from the other side of the shelf.

The book sat heavy in my hands, colder than it had any right to be. The leather cover stuck faintly to my palms, as though it were sweating. For a long moment, I just knelt there, crouched in the dark, listening to the breathing on the other side of the shelf.

Inhale.

Exhale.

A sound too steady to be an accident.

I squeezed my eyes shut, willing it away. It had to be in my head. Just the blood loss, the exhaustion, the dream still leaking into reality. When I opened my eyes again, the sound had stopped.

But the silence wasn’t any better.

My pulse thudded in my ears as I staggered to my feet. The book weighed down my arm like an anchor, pulling me back toward the shelf, but I refused to open it. Not yet. I shoved it under my arm and forced myself down the row, each step dragging.

The shelves towered over me like walls. My shoulder brushed them as I walked, and dust rained down in little cascades. The air was damp, heavy, and I swore it thickened the deeper I went.

At the end of the row, I turned sharply, moving toward the exit. My body screamed to get out. My mind screamed louder. Just leave. Toss the thing. Pretend it never happened. Forget.

But every step forward was harder than the last. My legs trembled. My cuts throbbed. It felt like I was walking against a current, like the library itself was holding me back.

I stopped, panting, gripping the book to my chest. The urge to throw it — to just hurl it into the dark and run — burned in me. My arm even twitched with the motion.

And then, faint as a sigh, the whisper returned.

…row 15… bottom row…

My stomach lurched. The voice wasn’t around me this time. It came from the book. Vibrating through the leather cover into my bones.

I dropped it.

The sound was louder than it should have been, a hollow thud that echoed through the stacks. Dust spiraled upward. My hands shook as though they’d touched something electric.

Silence followed. A long, suffocating silence.

And then — the breathing again. Closer now.

I spun around, heart hammering, but the row behind me was empty. Nothing but books and shadows. No footsteps, no movement. Just me.

My chest heaved. My cuts burned. My body screamed for the door, but my eyes… my eyes wouldn’t leave the book on the floor.

It lay there, black cover catching the thin blade of moonlight. Waiting.

I took a step toward it. Then another. My breath came ragged, shallow. Each step sounded too loud. The carpet muffled nothing.

Kneeling again, I reached out, fingers trembling. The leather was cold as ice when I touched it, colder than before.

My hand hovered over the edge of the cover. My body felt split in two — one half desperate to flee, the other compelled, dragged by invisible hooks.

And then the whisper returned, not faint this time, not soft.

OPEN IT.

The sound wasn’t outside. It was inside. Rattling through my skull, pressing against my teeth, vibrating down my spine.

I froze, paralyzed between terror and inevitability, staring at the unmarked cover, knowing that once I did, there would be no going back.",2,1759293319.0,nosleep,2,0.63,False

1nuyy9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditWritesTheOffice/comments/1nuyy9z/toby_wins_the_lottery/,Toby Wins The Lottery,"In the fluorescent-lit purgatory of Dunder Mifflin’s Scranton branch, the day started like any other—Michael Scott pontificating about his latest “World’s Best Boss” mug purchase, Dwight sharpening pencils with unnerving intensity, and Jim planned out his next prank of the day. But at 10:17 a.m., everything changed. Toby, in a rare moment of audible speech, announced he’d won the Pennsylvania Mega Millions—$47 million, lump sum. The office froze. Pam dropped her teapot. Kevin’s jaw hung open, a half-eaten donut tumbling onto his desk.“

Toby?!” Michael shrieked, his voice cracking like a pubescent banshee. “You? The human equivalent of a wet sock? You don’t deserve this! I’m the one who buys lottery tickets every week—me, Michael Gary Scott, the man who deserves to be bathed in gold!” His arms flailed, knocking over a stack of paper reams. “This is an injustice! I’m calling the lottery commission!”

Toby mumbled, “It was a Quick Pick.” 

The office erupted. Suddenly, everyone was Toby’s best friend. Stanley offered him a rare smile and a “congratulations, man.” Meredith slid over, asking if he needed a “personal assistant” for his new mansion. Even Creed, emerging from whatever void he inhabits, offered Toby a “slightly used” harmonica as a token of their “lifelong bond.”

Michael, seething, watched his spotlight dim. “This is my office! I’m the star! Not Toby, the guy who looks like he cries in his Prius every lunch break!” Desperate, he hatched a plan. By noon, he was strutting around, claiming he’d won the lottery too—a cool one trillion dollars. “Yeah, it’s a new secret lottery for awesome people,” he bragged, oblivious to Jim’s deadpan stare at the camera crew. 

“I’m buying a jet. And a dinosaur skeleton. And a hotel on the moon!”

Meanwhile, Toby, ever the accountant’s pet, sat with Oscar in the break room, discussing annuities and tax shelters. “I’m thinking low-risk index funds,” Toby said, sipping decaf. Oscar nodded approvingly. “Smart. You could live comfortably forever.” 

Kevin, overhearing, waddled over, crumbs on his shirt. “Toby, take me to Switzerland. I wanna eat all the chocolate. Like, every bar. I’ll be the Willy Wonka but Kevin Wonka.” 

Toby blinked. “Uh, I’ll think about it.”

Dwight, sensing opportunity, cornered Toby by the copier. “Toby, as a man of newfound wealth, you need security. Invest in Schrute Farms’ Mega Underground Doomsday Bunker! Reinforced concrete, 20-year food supply, and a state-of-the-art defense system. Only $10 million to start!” He unrolled a blueprint labeled “APOCALYPSE PALACE.” 

Toby mumbled, “I’ll...pass.”

Weeks later, Toby announced his retirement. The office gathered for his goodbye party, which Michael begrudgingly allowed (“Only because everyone forced me.”). Toby, in a shocking display of generosity, left gifts for everyone. Pam got a high-end art set, Stanley expensive wine set, and Kevin a year’s supply of M&M’s (“Closest I could get to Switzerland”). Even Dwight received a custom meat-carving knife set. Michael, however, got an envelope. “Probably a stupid poem,” he scoffed, tossing it into the dumpster out back during a dramatic speech about how he would’ve given better gifts.

The next day, Jim, smirking, mentioned to Michael, “You know, Toby left everyone $100,000 checks in those envelopes.” 

Michael’s face froze. “What?!” 

He sprinted to the parking lot, Dwight hot on his heels, shouting, “Michael, we must retrieve it! The Schrute legacy depends on this!” 

They drove to the city dump, diving into a sea of garbage bags, coffee grounds, and questionable diapers. “This is your fault, Dwight!” Michael wailed, up to his knees in sludge. “You’re the one who said envelopes are for losers!” 

Dwight, covered in filth, retorted, “False! Envelopes are the currency of the weak!”

Back at Schrute Farms, Dwight, undeterred by Toby’s refusal, began sketching his bunker plans. “With my cut of Michael’s check—if we find it—I’ll build the ultimate sanctuary. Twenty women, all trained in beet farming and krav maga. My harem will thrive post-apocalypse!” He cackled, sketching a moat filled with piranhas and hippopotamuses.

Michael never found the envelope. He returned to the office, reeking of garbage, claiming he “chose to donate” the $100,000 to “charity.” Jim raised an eyebrow. Pam stifled a laugh. And somewhere, on a quiet beach, Toby sipped a piña colada, free from Michael’s madness forever.

Along with CPAP, I also started taking meds (atomoxetine). After a few months, when I sleep without CPAP, I don’t feel any of the symptoms anymore: no dry mouth, no waking up tired, no need for coffee during the day, and no reflux. But when I use CPAP, I sleep really badly — I wake up tired, wake up multiple times during the night — and this has been going on for months already. It honestly feels like CPAP is making it worse.

It looks like just the meds and some weight loss have solved my problems, but it feels strange. I do have a doctor following me and adjusting the CPAP, and she says it’s well adjusted, but she never really takes what I say seriously (maybe because I’m autistic).

1nuywf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/women/comments/1nuywf6/why_bother_dating/,Why bother dating?,"I 34f want a man who is a whole person, not a man child who wants me to do everything for him. A man who has his own life and friends, who has his own wants, needs and desires. 

I've been dating this guy 26m for about a month. Things seemed promising, good steady job, pays his bills attentive with my likes and dislikes, takes interest in my interests, like actually not in a faking way. Until tonight. Now I don't know if there's any return. 

He's clingy to the point where I specifically don't invite him out to do everything I do with my friends because he refuses to venture out on his own to make his own friends. (He just got stationed in my city a couple of months ago) I KNEW he wasn't going to put in the effort if I didn't set boundaries. 

Tonight he said half joking and half very serious which to me isn't funny at all. ""I don't need friends, I have you and your friends and that's all I need."" 

But that's not the kind of relationship I want. I don't want someone who's joined at the hip and we never experience life without the other. I told him ""Look, I strive to be a whole person on my own, and independence is a major thing for me. I'm happy to have you come to stuff, but I'm also going to spend time with MY friends on my own, we're two separate people who should have two separate lives that we can share together."" He got really quiet after that. 

His apartment isn't gross,  but he doesn't clean before I come over. Like there's still the same packaging trash on the ground from two weeks ago where he'd opened the new board game we played. 

He's starting on ozempic, found out he's type 2 diabetic. Says ""I'm scared to do it, if I come over you'll do it for me right?"" 🥺

No. I'm a nurse. Not YOUR nurse. Literally told him ""you're covered in tattoos. I think you'll get over the less than baby sized needle just fine on your own.'

But the REAL ick. He's thinking of a career change, I said ""oh ok, what were you thinking of doing instead?"" He listed off potential jobs. I thought ok cool at least he's put in some effort into thinking about what's next until he says 

""Or I could just not work and you could take care of me."" 

I really wanted to like him. I didn't want to do what I've done with nearly every other relationship I've been in where it hits the two month mark and I just go ""nope"" and end it for whatever reason I find at the time. But nothing makes ME immediately recoil and physically shudder than a man who wants a mommy. It's not my thing. I don't want kids and I'm not willing to raise another man child. Been there did that for 8yrs. Never again. 

There seems to be a pattern here and I don't know how to escape it. I don't do things for them, like sure I'll pick up coffee or take turns driving. But I don't clean up his house and I don't offer to do anything in that respect. If he asks me to do something he's more than capable of I tell him ""I'm sure you'll find a way to figure it out."" 

I don't know if there's a way to go forward from this, or if I should just do what I do and end things now because I can't see any other option. 

EDIT: Yes he's younger, literally the youngest I've ever dated, trust me it was a big deal for me I didn't just hop willy nilly into it. It's not JUST the age that's the problem I GUARANTEE it. This is an issue I've had with men older than me as well. At this point I think it's a location thing. My ex of 8 years was 5 years older than me and look at how that turned out exactly the same I was just dumb enough to put up with it for so long because I didn't know better. The bestie is dating a guy with the same age gap, he's not like this. I'm not saying  any of you are wrong, just adding that's not the specific.

1nuyvbz,https://www.reddit.com/r/goldenretrievers/comments/1nuyvbz/impending_divorce_i_will_keep_you_updated/,Impending divorce. (I will keep you updated.),"Our sweet golden boy, Jack is one year old today. Woo-hoo! He is funny and silly and loving and exactly what a golden should be. It’s like he is made out of magic and butter or something. He is fantastic. When he was 5 months old, we added a miniature schnauzer to the mix which: 1) proves we are certifiably insane and: 2) was actually well thought out and the right decision because we’re getting through this puppy business in one go, not waiting until one is completely trained then starting all over again. I knew exactly what we were getting into. We have had many dogs and I have trained them all and to be completely honest, this has not been nearly as difficult as I had anticipated. More expensive, yes, but not more difficult. The schnauzer goes to work with me at least 3-4 days a week, and my daughter (21) is home with Jack those days or he has free range of the kitchen area if he is alone, 4 hours at most until someone is back with him. There has been zero problems with training or anxiety or any destructive behavior. (They did tag-team a piece of the Pergo flooring a few months ago, but to be honest, it was original to the house, starting to peel and needed to be replaced anyway, so I almost feel like they did me a favor and nudged my husband along with that particular project. I had already pointed it out and asked him several times when he planned on replacing the kitchen floor…) There was also the rung of one chair and the insole of one shoe. Jack did consume seven YES, I SAID SEVEN, earbuds, but that was on me for falling asleep and putting them on the coffee table one at a time. I eventually just started buying the cheap ones. (Did you know a golden retreiver can poop out an earbud and somehow it can still connect to your phone? Facts. This happened with one of them. And it was a cheap one, too! They can hold a charge for a surprising amount of time and they cost me less than $20! I was impressed. I have since ordered that brand twice more. Easily digestible and has a great battery life. SOLD!) Other than that-zero loss of property. Not too bad for 2 puppies, I’d say. 

Jack does seem to have lost a few brain cells in the past month or so, but I believe it’s just normal typical teenage golden retreiver traits shining through and it will all be fine in a while. He’s not stupid, just goofy and easily distracted. Not overly hyper or insane, just typical lay-on-the-sofa-upside-down-with-three-tennis-balls-in-his-mouth-and-his-head-on-the-floor goofy. However, we have worked with them NONSTOP since they arrived on scene last year. Mostly myself and my daughter, as my husband works 10-hour days then has weekends off, which he spends almost entirely with the boys.  We are able to stagger being at home time wise, so it works great with the dog’s schedules.  
If you have a young golden or a young schnauzer you know they are VERY different types of dogs and both require very intensive training and loads of time every single day. I mean, we’re not even out of the weeds yet with the two boys we’ve got, I know this for certain, but we’ve made fantastic headway and a great start of it. Training lasts for several years and never ever really stops completely, just turns into reminders of that what have already learned. Now granted, this progress was made by 3 grown adults juggling them  and staying on top of things. I have done the majority of the actual training and heavy lifting, but it’s been fine. They are honestly pretty easy dogs and they listen well and I can finally see the sun! Much less work now than in the beginning. Pat on our backs, we have put the time in and done the stuff and blah blah blah and they are awesome. 
So this is where the problem lies. 

Jack is a year old. Morgan is only 9.5 months (but goes to work with me daily, as I stated above, and does in fact act like a much older dog than he actually is. I’m certain it’s the extreme socialization in combination with the soul of the deceased Victorian child that resides in his small body staring out at me under those intense brows with his little green eyes judging every move I make, but I digress, that’s neither here nor there). My daughter is preparing to move across the country, so there will be fewer hands to help with the boys. Jack is bigger now and is fine being alone for 4-6 hours at a time several days a week and if I feel he is too lonely, I can always leave the schnauzer with him for company as well. We have a cat also, but she is pretty much useless as a companion and I think she says rude things to Jack behind our backs about being obtuse or licking the glass door for no reason or chewing on his own leg like a bully stick because…cat. Also, he is a one-year-old golden retreiver so she’s not exactly wrong. 

So we are just crawling into bed last night (a new king-sized bed, I might add, we just bought so the boys have room to sleep with us) and my husband casually mentions he thinks we should CONTACT THE BREEDER AND GET ON THE LIST FOR ANOTHER GOLDEN PUPPY so Jack is not alone. 
Y’all. I can’t even. 
Wait. WHAT? 
Um…no. 
Absofreakinglutelynot. 
This man is out of his mind. 
It’s like he forgot the hundreds of hours we’ve spent over the last year and the literal thousands of dollars we’ve spent on everything from buying the pups to vet bills and all the gajillion other things we bought for them from sofa cushion covers to life jackets to a booster seat for the car to a $4732.17 two-night stay at the emergency vet clinic after Jack found a copperhead in the back yard (and I did mention the new kitchen flooring and king sized bed, right?) 
Oh my God. 
I swear I will take this little haunted schnauzer and sleep on the floor of my art gallery if he brings another golden retreiver home anytime within the next 4 years! 
I just do not have it in me. I adore Jack but it’s a LOT. The fur alone tells me I should have been a weaver instead of a potter. 

I believe this man would like to stay married to me. We are 3 grown kids and 29 years in it and we’re both still here, but ya never know, another golden baby might just be my tipping point. There are worse things that could happen. Illness. Infidelity. Financial ruin of some kind. But honest to God I think I could handle any of those about as well as I could handle another golden retreiver puppy right now. 

Pray for me, y’all. 

I’ll keep you posted.

1nuyv1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1nuyv1i/woman_f21_living_with_all_men_who_dunnit_situation/,Woman F21 living with all men - who dunnit situation???,"Okay so this is a weird one but I’m at a loss for explanation.

So for background: I’m 21F and I moved into a house with five bedrooms in May. In the area I live in, the rent was too good to pass up and it’s in a great area, so I was able to overlook the fact that I was living with all men, and honestly after I met them all I rly assumed the best of them. 
We have Mike: M33, Jesús: M30, Justin: M30, Colin: M28, and Ty: M(idk maybe 20’s)

Mike and Jesus live on the top floor in bedrooms next to me, Justin and Colin on the main floor below us, and Ty in the basement ( I literally never see him)

I immediately got along super well with Jesus and Justin, and I trust them a lot. They go out of their way to make sure I’m not uncomfortable and they spend time to themselves a lot. Mike on the other hand was very forward with me within a week of moving in. He’s deaf and would type things on his phone and hand it to me to read and that’s how we would talk, so I think I put up with more then I should have cuz I felt bad he had to communicate that way, I guess I kind of thought maybe none of the other guys talked to him so I would let him chat with me a lot. Well the messages got increasingly creepier and he started commenting on my body, asking if I wanted to grab coffee, was gonna grab wine for chats after work, etc. At this time I shut it down and let him know it was weird age wise and also weird bc he knew I was seeing someone.
He said he would leave me alone (he kinda did) but there was a few instances of him still trying to talk to me in the kitchen or catch me on the stairs, but I’d usually shut it down.

Okay so today: I left my house at 9am this morning. I go in and out of my room several times before I leave because I try on different outfits and the only mirror is all the way downstairs. So I would have noticed anything that didn’t belong to me sitting smack in the middle of my bedroom.
I went to school ALL DAY (block classes, ugh) and came home about 9:30pm. I open my bedroom door and FIRST THING I NOTICE is a huge pair of black slippers smack in the middle of my room. Like literally placed perfectly so it’s the first thing I’d see. They ARE NOT MINE. I immediately call down to Justin who was watching tv in the living room and I asked him if he had been in my room, he obvs said no. I then text Jesus and he also says no, sounds confused and then opens his door and sees me standing in front of the shoes. Then he goes “wtf those are mine. Why are my shoes in ur room?”

At first I had assumed maybe he left them there by accident dropping a package on my bed or something and (the room is a terrible mess so he could’ve taken his shoes off as to not step on anything to get to my bed) he smokes a lot of pot and maybe he was super high and left them there? But he would’ve just said that, also, no package in my room.

Then they immediately thought of Mike because Colin was gone all day, Ty doesn’t come upstairs, and Justin had just gotten home and they all left before I did earlier this morning. The landlord checked the cameras and no one else had come in or out. That leaves only Mike and Jesus at home, and Jesus was gone for like four hours from 2-6. I really don’t see Jesus doing this… so that would leave Mike.

First, Jesus asked Mike over text in private, and he said no. So I asked the groupchat, everyone said no. Everyone kind of tried to laugh it off, only Jesus and my landlord seemed actually upset and Colin seemed a little worried.

After that died down, I got a knock at my door while I was changing in my room. I opened the door and Mike was standing there and he had typed out asking if I was doing okay. I said yes and then he asked me if I had ever seen one of “these” and grabs a key off the top of my door. Turns out I have a key on top of my door that unlocks doors from the outside, my mom said they are called bathroom keys?? Well then he proceeds to type out that he’s had privacy issues too and to use this or something. I just said thanks and closed the door. For some reason that weirded me out more and also NO ONE SAID I HAD A KEY ON THE TOP OF MY DOOR THAT OPENS MY BEDROOM FROM
THE OUTSIDE TIL NOW???

So now I’m at a loss here. Are we thinking Mike? And if so, wtf was the purpose? I don’t see any underwear missing but I do have a sex toy that sits on my desk next to my bed. Could he have gone in to do something creepy? Should I confront him? Can someone tell me from the outside what this sounds/looks like??

Thank you so much and sorry for the long question.

TL;DR: 5 male roommates, moved in in May, Mike asked me out I said no, Shoes left in my bedroom while I was gone, concerned it may be Mike but not sure if the reason for them being there is malicious or not.",6,1759293004.0,Adulting,2,1.0,False

""Sugar, and I can't tell you how grateful knowing you're here for me."" My husband Madsen's voice voice filtered through the door, a shard straight to my heart.
""Twenty years next months with Emily. A long time."" He supplied, his tone deadpan as though he were reading an instruction manual rather than tearing his wife's heart apart. 
""A tip. Don't let yourself be locked down with just one person.""
My chest ached with the breath I was holding, but it released in a hiss. Rage coiled through me, and I slammed the door open. ""Liar!""
He jolted up from the sofa, eyes wide.
""No, Em—wait, that’s not what it sounded like!"" His voice cracked, raw with fear. ""I never crossed the line with Sarah, never!""
""You ever been tempted to sleep with her?"" I locked eyes with him—the man I’d loved for decades.
He hesitated.
In that pause, all the read but unanswered texts, all the nights with the empty bed and even emptier promises came flooding back—Now I knew where he’d been.
I wiped the tears from my cheeks, and swallowed down my sobs.
""You make me sick.""
——
Emily Flowers braced one hand against the wall, tried to catch her breath, and failed.
Her lungs refused to drag in air because her heart was no longer beating.
Because it had just shattered into a million jagged pieces, covered in blood and bits of shredded, gory flesh.
She should have kept walking. She should have never even come to the clubhouse in the first place. But she was a good wife, a g0dd@mn wifey rock star, and she wanted to make sure her husband, the love of her life, had his favorite pair of jeans—she'd even repaired the hole in the waistband for him. All she planned to do was leave them in his bedroom upstairs, pop her head into his office to tell them they were there...maybe get one of those beautiful crooked smiles from him for the first time in too long, a smile that she was so freaking needy for. That same smile that had won her adolescent heart that summer day long ago. That same smile that turned her inside out on their wedding day, as she stood before him, sliding a ring on his finger, and pledging her life to him.
It was that ring, that pledge that had brought her to the clubhouse, her loyalty despite the chilly, steel walls thickening between them. She missed him, so freaking much, so she told herself that even a glimpse of him, the rumbling sound of his voice, the whiff of his familiar leather and bourbon scent would be enough to hold her over until they could figure things out.
And they would figure things out, because they were end game, they were forever. They were one and only.
But she shouldn't have bothered.
She shouldn't have given in to the desperate urge to see her husband, a man she hadn't set eyes on in over a week. A man who had clothes in her closet, coffee mugs in her cupboards, and a cold, empty spot on the other side of her bed, but hadn't set foot in their home of fifteen years in over seven days.
She should have known something was wrong; he never went that long without at least coming to grab a change of clothes. When they'd first married, for those first few months before he'd enlisted and shipped off to Fort Drum, he'd been a homebody, only ever leaving their tiny single-wide trailer to go to work at the grocery store, stocking the shelves. After work, he'd come home, stay home, and they'd spend all their time together. They had no money for fun and extras, so they made do with cable they stole from the next-door neighbors, cheap meals, a comfortable bed, and the person they loved. But now...he was an MC president and former American warrior, so she was used to long absences in the name of duty.
But lately....
Her ears, the tips burning, locked in on a voice that wasn't the smoky rumble of her husband's.
""Frost...you know I'm here for you....""
It wasn't ""duty"" her husband, the love of her life, was chatting with behind a closed door in his office in the middle of the day. A sliver of a crack between the door and the frame allowed the voices to carry into the suddenly suffocating emptiness of the corridor.
Thankfully, the clubhouse was empty; the brothers and who-res all busy doing whatever the he1l they did during the day.
At least they aren't here to see me fall apart...their ""queen"".
What a freaking joke.
I should have kept walking.... Her breath caught as her husband's voice caught her ear.
""I know you are, sugar, and I can't tell you how grateful I am,"" Frost replied in a tone, soft and warm, that Emily had only ever heard him use with her and their children. His family. Their family. His and hers. A family they'd built from nothing but adolescent hopes and dreams.
And sugar? When did he start calling other women pet names?
Something inside of her twisted painfully, making her bite back a groan.
He called their daughter, Sorsha, ""Princess"", and he called—used to call Emily, his wife, his ""Bloom."" Even as a kid, she'd been fascinated by flowers and plants, so much so that her dream had always been to ""do something"" with flowers. And he always said he loved that about her, that she loved pretty, living things, and that she was so good at growing things that made people smile. She always preened when she'd said things like that, his words filling her up, like she'd inhaled a lungful of the most beautiful fragrance, then held it there to memorize every separate scent.
A scent that meant everything to her.
But now...the scent on that bloom no longer pleased...it stank like it had been cut from the bush and left to rot in the dirt.
Sugar...he'd never called any other woman anything other than their name.
That wasn't true now.
Her heart jerked in her chest, pushing jolts of energy into her limbs, urging her to keep moving, to walk away, to escape so she wouldn't have to hear the other half of her soul give a piece of himself to another woman.
I should have kept walking.... Because then she would be blissfully ignorant. That was better than the pain, right? Than the realization that what she'd feared the most in the whole world was playing out just on the other side of an office door.
But she hadn't kept walking, didn't pas-s by his office to drop his jeans in his room as she'd planned when she'd first arrived; she stopped...because she'd heard her name...and the rest of what she heard turned her feet to stone.
""I know Emily hasn't been around in a while,"" a voice Emily was starting to really hate remarked, the tone slimy with false empathy.
She easily recognized her husband's grunt, which was an answer all on its own.
The other woman gave out a heavy sigh, like she had anything heavy other than those ti ts which were as fake as the diamond in the first engagement ring her husband gave her, back when all he could afford was the plastic ring he bought from the dispenser at Chuck E. Cheese for a quarter on his twenty-first birthday, and she was just shy of eighteen...and two months pregnant with their twins.
Their romance was somewhat controversial in that he was a legal adult when they'd first had se-x, but they'd been careful to follow Pennsylvania's Romeo & Juliet laws. People could curl their lips in disgust, but they weren't doing anything wrong. So, when he was drinking age, and she was still in high school, he put a ring on it.
But that ring from the cheap machine meant more to her than the authentic diamond ring he bought her five years later, after his first deployment.
Emily dropped her gaze to the ring, still encircling her finger, a finger wrapped in a Band-Aid because she'd been distracted and had gotten her finger caught in the wire she was using to create a funeral wreath.
""Are things okay between you two—I only ask because I worry about you."" The words sounded genuine, delivered with a soft cooing that made Em's teeth grind, but Emily knew the utterances of manipulation when she heard them. And Mads should, too.
Right?
""Everyone wants what you have, Frost...even me,"" that voice simpered, a pout obvious in her tone.
She wanted what Frost had, did she? Or did she simply want Frost?
Acrid saliva built in the back of Em's throat, but she swallowed it back.
Forcing the sudden buzzing from her ears, she held her breath once more to listen through the sliver in the doorway.
""You don't understand,"" the voice of her husband, Madsen Flowers, her heart and soul, said softly, gently, pleadingly, ""you are too young to be stuck—you have a full life ahead of you. You cannot let yourself be locked down with just one person.""
""Like you did?"" that freaking voice asked, a little too interested, though it was skillfully hidden behind empathetic cooing.
Like you did? Sarah, the slinky club b1tch, was asking Frost if he was stuck—as in...with his wife? What the he1l?
Em's chest ached with the breath she was holding, but it released in a hiss.
Please, please say ""no"" that you aren't talking about yourself—about us....
""Twenty years next month,"" Madsen supplied, his tone deadpan as though he were reading an instruction manual rather than tearing his wife's heart apart. ""Started dating at twenty, but...I'd known her for years before that. Best friends."" There was a speaking silence, one that whispered ""enduring"" and ""everlasting."" He sighed, the sound like a gunshot in an empty stadium. ""Long time.""
Yes, a long time—from the time she turned sixteen and he was twenty, but they waited to have se-x until she was seventeen, almost eighteen, because he wanted to make sure she was truly ready.
And she had been. They'd both been.
There was a shuffling, like feet moving across the industrial carpeting, and then the tell-tale sound of creaking leather as someone sat down.
The sliver in the door didn't allow for her to see inside, so she had no idea what was happening. Did she want to know what was happening? Were they sitting together on that old leather couch? Were they sitting close? Were their arms touching, their legs? Were they leaning into each other, staring into each other's eyes even now, in the silence?
God, she couldn't get enough air.
He wouldn't cheat...he isn't a cheater... That wasn't the man she fell in love with eighteen years ago, and married nineteen years ago; her husband was fiercely loyal, dedicated, loving, and honorable.
But then...he wasn't exactly that same man she'd married; the man sitting in that office was the same man who'd ordered one of this trusted club brothers to target and seduce an innocent woman. Locust and Nadia were still healing from that treachery.
No...the man sitting in that office, the one who could order that...she didn't know him.
And now uncertainty morphed into a slithering, slimy fear.
""I get it, Frost, I do,"" the young woman's voice filled with silence, the tone placating and a little 'see me, I'm right here, lean on me.' ""I'm sorry your life has been like that, but...it doesn't have to be that way anymore. You're se-xy, amazing, and you're still young. You have options.""
Mads gave a tight laugh, then offered, ""Yeah...I do...."" There was a flatness to his voice that made Em blink; she'd never heard him like that before. But it wasn't the tone that had ripped out a piece of her soul, it was that he agreed with Sarah.
He had options?
Like Sarah—the club skank with the perfect rack, peachy as-s, long legs, flawless skin, and not a single ounce of fat? Sarah, who didn't have that same pooch from nineteen years ago from carrying twins. Sarah, who hadn't breastfed to babies for over a year. Sarah, who didn't stress eat, then diet in a vicious cycle until her skin was a hormonal mess, complete with miles of stretch marks from all the yo-yoing. Sarah, who's hair was soft and golden and didn't have a single split end, because she had the time and effort to do whatever bullsh-it hair routine TikTok was raving about. Em's hair was just there, blonde but the dull kind, the kind that was washed in Target brand shampoo and left to dry in a ponytail because Em had sh-it to do and didn't have time to do more than that.
Sarah was young, skinny, beautiful, and took care of herself.
But she wasn't Sarah, and apparently, Mads had noticed.
How long? How long have I not been good enough that he now needs options?
Sucking in a breath to stop the spots from dancing in her eyes, Em tried to take a step back but couldn't. The pair of jeans in her hands were leaving marks in her skin from where she was squeezing them so tightly in her fists, her fingers ached from the force.
Sarah, not knowing she was tearing apart a marriage word-by-word, cooed, ""Hey, how 'bout we grab some food from Lowry's and head to that spot by the lake you showed me. It's beautiful there, and that big red tree is the perfect place for a picnic.""
Spot by the lake...big red tree....
Em gasped, quickly pressing her hand against her mouth to muffle the sound.
No. Sarah, the club who-re, the young, buxom, blonde release dumpster, couldn't be talking about the overlook on the lake on Mads's grandpa's property, the land the old man had gifted to Em and Madsen on their wedding day, the land where she had always hoped to build their dream home, but Mads kept putting it off, with one excuse after another. The land with the big red maple tree, the one Mads had carved their initials into twenty years ago when he'd made the promise to love her forever. Their spot. Their special place. For the two of them.
He'd taken her to their spot?
After a moment of weighty silence, her husband replied, ""Sure, yeah, that sounds good.""
And he was taking her there again. To their spot. On their land...where their dreams of a future, family, and forever had been etched into that same red maple tree.
The red maple tree she and Mads hand planted, by hand, when she was twelve and he was sixteen. It had symbolized their—then—budding friendship that had quickly turned to young love when she'd turned sixteen, and then forever love when she'd married him at eighteen, pregnant with their twins. That tree was them, their story, their timeline—roots, trunk, branches, and leaves.
And he was taking another woman to sit beneath those branches, to be shaded by the leaves, to settle against the trunk, and picnic on the soil nurturing those roots.
Tainted. Diseased. Withering. Dying. That tree was no longer a testament to the growth, strength, vitality, and longevity of their marriage...it was a carcas-s, still standing, but in need of culling.
He took her to our spot...is taking her again....
Had he...had he made l0ve to Sarah under the tree...as he had with Em all those years ago when she'd gifted him her virgin1ty...and he'd gifted her his. They were each other's first...under that red maple tree.
Had her husband, her one and only, taken another woman and given himself to her at the base of that tree, with only fallen leaves as a soft blanket beneath them? Had he slowly undressed her, or was it a desperate shedding of clothes fueled by raging desire for one another? Had he looked down at her n@ked body and compared it to his wife's, a body that had wear and tear, and stretch and sag? Had his eyes burned with lust and his body grow hot and hard with need for her, for the body that was perfect—unlike the worn, lumpy, not so shiny body of his wife?
Em's mouth flooded, bile rising to coat her tongue and teeth with sour acid, the need to vomit rising with it.
Trembling, Em finally found the strength to push away from the wall, to stumble down the corridor, back toward the door leading to the rear parking lot where she'd parked. Sliding into her 2024 Dodge Durango, she didn't remember anything after hitting the start button, but she had to have known where she needed to go because in a blink she was parked in the two-car garage of their home just outside of Wilkes-Barre, the one they'd bought when their family of four had outgrown the tiny apartment they'd rented right before Mads's first deployment. This house, with its two thousand five hundred square feet was only meant to be a stopover, a place to rest until their forever home on Granddad's land was built. But year after year, they remained, and year after year, Mads spent less and less time there, and now that the twins were off to college, it sat empty a lot of the time. She worked long hours as the owner and manager of Flower's Blooms, and Mads spent more and more time at the clubhouse. So the home that she'd painstakingly built over the years, the resting place, the safe haven, the heart and soul that she'd seeded, planted, and nurtured over the last fifteen years was now simply a cold, desiccated husk.
Sliding out of the driver's seat, Em set to work. She dropped the jeans she'd meant to give her husband on the kitchen counter beside her purse, then she headed to the smart home hub located on the wall in her home office. Mads had demanded they upgrade the house because he was tired of losing and then having to beg her to find his keys. Also, the home was wired with exterior cameras, window sensors, and all the bells and security whistles an MC president required in his home.
It's going to bite him in the as-s how, aint it?
Unlocking the system, Em proceeded to change the key code for the front and back doors. The interior garage door, leading into the kitchen, didn't have a key, since they only ever locked it once everyone was in for the night, so no one ever needed a key for it.
That, too, would bite Mads in the as-s.
The Flowers' home lockdown complete, her legs trembling, her chest aching as her heart attempted to lurch from it, she collapsed onto the floor just inside the back door, her limp and yet frozen body slumped against it.
Hands shaking, she took out her phone, sending a text she never thought she'd ever have to send.
QueenEm: CODE RED.
Sitting on the cold tile floor, in the kitchen of the home she'd built with the man she loved, the man who betrayed her, she promptly fell apart.
Frost groaned, throwing his head back, his throat working, his eyes closed tight, his body vibrating with unspent tension.
Fuuuuuck....
Ten days. It had been ten fu-cking days since he'd been home, since he'd seen his wife. It had been three days since he'd spoken with his wife, and that was three fu-cking days too long.
He ached with the absence of her.
And whose fu-cking fault is that?
Scrubbing his hand down his face, he heaved a sigh and leaned back in his desk chair, the aged leather creaking and the metal base squeaking with the movement. He could buy a new one, but this one was worn in, comfortable, fitting him perfectly.
Just like his marriage. Best friends for twenty-three years. A couple for twenty years. Married for nineteen years, two kids, six deployments from Fort Drum, two moves—from their tiny apartment to the house they currently lived in, and years of stress, drama, and other ups and downs with the Unchained MC.... Their relationship was older than some of the prospects looking to patch into the club, but that was one of the best things about it.
Right?
That his marriage was strong, uncomplicated...and...well, he was content.
At least he had been before the kids left for college, creating a vacuum where all-consuming chaos and noise once reigned. Now...there was silence, there was peace, there was...an emptiness he couldn't quite fill, especially now that Em wasn't there as often as she'd once been. Now...he had no idea what the fu-ck was going on.
Em, his Em, was his rock, his home, his reason. Em, his Em, his Bloom, had been with him from the very beginning, through all of his deployments in the Army, then all his long weeks away during road trips or long nights dealing with club business. His Em was used to long absences, some without contact for days or weeks at a time. But not once since he'd been discharged from the US Army had he and his wife gone so long without at least texting.
Yeah, he should have noticed on day one that she hadn't texted, called, or had one of the brothers check in on him—she was a good wife like that. Truth was, he could have reached out to her too, checked in on her, told her he missed her and wished he could be home with her, wished he could lay next to her in their bed, make l0ve to her. But...well...he didn't have an excuse. He'd been letting the bullsh-it with the Bone Dogz patch over, drama with the brothers and their women, and the upcoming Cool Hands costume party and fundraiser keep his head occupied.
He was jerked from his thoughts when his cell chimed with a text from his desk, where a pile of invoices still sat untouched. sh-it, he was never going to be out from under that pile of bullsh-it.
Maybe I should just let Patriot handle it...then maybe I can see my fu-cking wife again....
His phone chimed again, and he checked it.
Sarah: Thank you for lunch on Tuesday and yesterday. I can't believe how beautiful that place is.
Sarah: Do you think we can go there again tomorrow? Weather is supposed to be perfect.
A hot poker covered in acid impaled him.
fu-ck....
He scrubbed a hand down his face and pinched his eyes shut.
The moment he'd first set foot beneath that red maple tree with a woman who was not his wife, he'd known he'd done something irreparable. But...that day, he'd needed a moment, and Sarah had been vocally upset about something with her family back in New York, and he'd stupidly thought she could come with him, find peace and solace in the beauty and quiet of the back mountain property he and Em had owned for decades. He'd taken the truck, and Sarah had sat beside him, chatting about her issues with her mother, her hand reaching for his when she needed his strength, and once they'd parked at the fence line and gotten out of the truck, a weight had settled over him. An oppressive sense of wrongness that only added to his agitation over all the other bullsh-it he was dealing with. Rather than give in to it, to allow the stress of duty and obligation conquer him, he'd pushed forward, taking Sarah's hand to help her over the old log fence, and then leading her to the spot overlooking the small lake at the back of the property. He hadn't even noticed he was still holding her hand until she curled into him, sighing, at the sight of ""the spot."" The spot beneath the red maple tree he and Em had planted so long ago; a symbol of them, their growth, their relationship.
For fu-ck's sake, he carved their names into the bark of that tree the same night they'd taken each other's virginities.
Her voice soft, warm, filled with that sweetness he loved, she asked, ""What're you doin', Mads?""
He turned his head to look over his shoulder at her where she was laying, n@ked, her skin glowing in the moonlight, beneath a thin blanket on top of a sleeping bag he'd spread out to keep the chill of the ground away.
He couldn't stop the unrepentant and ravenous grin that lifted the corners of his mouth at the sight of her, his woman, his everything.
""I'm making a record of us, claiming this spot, this moment...for us,"" he replied, a feeling unlike anything he'd ever felt before filling him from his toes to this scalp.
With one last deep groove, Mads stepped back, the knife now loose in his aching fingers.
He felt her move, not needing to see her to know she was there, now standing behind him, the blanket wrapped around her beautiful body, a body he'd worshipped for hours that night.
Her breath against the back of his neck, he groaned when she pressed herself against his back, then wrapped her arms around his waist, holding him there, as though she were his anchor, and him her pillar.
""Wow, Mads...,"" she whispered, awe in her soft voice, ""it's amazing.""
He nodded silently, unable to tear his gaze from the permanent mark he'd left in the tree they'd planted three years ago. Red maples were fast growing, but they'd had no idea, when they'd planted it during Arbor Day when she was twelve and he was sixteen, that the tree would become a symbol of them. Em and Mads. And now it always would be.
""Mads loves Em 4-Ever,"" Em read, sighing.
His gaze, still riveted to the heart he'd etched deeply into the rough, gray bark of the tree, he barely heard her next words.
""Do you mean it?""
His heart slammed against his ribs as a warmth so like the heat of the sun overflowed from it. Turning, finally tearing his gaze from the tree, he looked down at the girl who'd owned that very same heart for as long as he could remember. Pulling her into his arms, he embraced her...and the bright, beautiful future they were going to have together.
Pressing a ki-ss to her head, he drew in a deep breath, and vowed, ""Until the day I die.""
That moment, twenty years ago, was still as fresh a memory as any he'd made that morning, and it was why he always returned to that tree, that spot, every time life became too fu-cking much.
Sarah had oohed and awwed at the sight, her issues with her family seemingly gone in an instant, and he was left with more internal upheaval than he'd had before he'd gotten in the truck. He knew he shouldn't have taken Sarah there the first time, but she when she'd asked again yesterday, he'd been...preoccupied, his mind a mine field of information, data, missed calls, missed texts, a cold, lonely bed, a cold, lonely heart, and when Sarah started talking about Em, like she seemed to do every time they were together...every mine in that mental mine field exploded at once. So, when she'd asked to go back, he didn't say no—she'd already been there before, what was the harm in taking her again? And, fu-ck, did he need at least that much, that moment under the tree where he'd once been happy with Em. She wasn't talking to him, wasn't checking in on him, wasn't being the wife and best friend he needed, so he'd take whatever the fu-ck he could from just sitting beneath the tree that meant something to the both of them.
And Sarah came along. They'd stopped for Chik-Fil-A, and sat beneath the branches of the tree. He ate, Sarah talked as he leaned against the bark of the tree, trying to absorb whatever energy he could from something Em touched, loved, cherished.
Like she'd once did him.
And whose fault is it that she doesn't give you the fu-cking time of day?
A ding of a text pulled him from his thoughts.
Sarah: I'm going to WNS. You want anything? I know you're out of Jack. You want the apple kind?
He almost smiled at that last question, because she knew d@mn well he thought apples belonged in pies not booze. He'd made a big deal about it at the last club BBQ when Cilla brought hard apple cider and tried to get him to try one. He'd been less than impressed.
Now, Sarah was going to the state-owned Wine & Spirits store, which meant she was on a run for one of the brothers and was asking if she could grab something for him while she was there.
Huh, that's thoughtful of her.... But that was Sarah; thoughtful. She was sweet as pie, always checking in on him, offering to get him things, showing she cared in a lot of little ways...like Em used to, back before she got busy being the boss lady. Now, it felt like he was an afterthought, something Em remembered when it suited her, and he was left puttering around in the periphery of her new life, one she obviously had no problem living without him.
When had they become like this; two separate people, living two separate lives?
When you became the as-shole who put more effort into the Bone Dogz than he did his own marriage?
fu-ck! That voice didn't know what the fu-ck it was talking about. His marriage had always been his priority, it was Em who started pulling away once the kids left for college.
Right?
Feeling his face pinch in a grimace, he reread Sarah's text, his thumbs hovering over the screen.
But he didn't message her back; he couldn't, not with the way he was feeling.
Confused. Charmed. Captivated. Contorted—like he was being twisted and pulled and bent in too many directions. How much longer before he gave out and simply...broke?
Sarah Yates. Twenty-two, high school dropout, child of a broken marriage, beautiful, and still sunny and hopeful despite all that life had thrown at her. She was new to his club, a club who-re that had moved to Unchained MC from the Bone Dogz previous clubhouse. When Frost had offered a home for the members and those under their protection, he knew the club would bring a few of their girls with them. Sarah was the only club who-re who'd made the move, though, stating that there was nothing keeping her in New York, and that she wasn't close with her family any longer, because they'd pretty much abandoned her when she'd moved in with the club. So, she'd moved from New York to Wilkes-Barre, and she'd quickly become a favorite among the single members of the Unchained. But it wasn't unhe1ltil she'd slunk over to sit next to him at the bar one night, months ago, that he'd actually talked to her.
She was intelligent, charming, witty, caring, and sensual. She'd used every trick in the club who-re manual to try and get into his bed that night, but he'd turned her down, reminding her that club who-res kept their hands off the brothers with old ladies. She'd blushed, seemed contrite, then asked if they could be friends. That was the problem, though, being friends with a club who-re was all kinds of awkward, but...she hadn't done anything wrong, and she was a breath of fresh air, and talking to her had stirred things in him that he hadn't felt in a long, long time. Since that first night, he'd found himself seeking her out, talking with her for long hours, sitting beside her, laying his head on her shoulder when the weight of his responsibilities became too heavy.
Yes, he knew he was using Sarah for what he should be giving to Em, but Em, well...she was busy being the badas-s boss b1tch at her business, a business she'd been dreaming about since she was thirteen. She was building success, and now that the kids were in college, she had more time to devote to her dream of being a professional florist. But where did that leave him?
Ignored. Forgotten. Pissed. Discontent. Out of sorts. Aching like a phantom limb.
It didn't help that she found out about you sending Locust on that fu-cked up mission to seduce an innocent woman.
Yeah, that had been one of the worst things he'd done in his life—he freely admitted that—and he could blame all the stress of the Bone Dogz patch over, but there was more to it...he just couldn't put his finger on it.
A knock on the doorjamb made him raise his head, and his gaze slammed into the hard, wary eyes of his VP.
""Need you in the conference room,"" Patriot said, his voice giving nothing away.
Heaving a sigh, Frost leaned back in his desk chair, and crossed his arms. ""Can't it wait? I've got sh-it to do."" Like figure out how to get out of taking Sarah to ""the spot"" again. Twice was already too many times, and if Em found out....
He couldn't stop the full body shudder even if he were made of stone.
Patriot's lips thinned, his eyes narrowing, he answered, ""No.""
That was it, that single word, and yet it carried a whole other meaning, one that made the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end.
fu-ck.
Standing, his bones like jelly, his heart like cement, he followed his VP from the room, knowing that he wouldn't return to his office the same man who'd left.",1,1759292766.0,romancenovels,2,1.0,False

1nuys69,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nuys69/prophetic_pages_part_1/,Prophetic Pages Part 1,"It was a rainy Saturday morning, and I could hear the rain tapping against my window. I looked up from my laptop and let out a soft sigh.

The sound was somewhat annoying, yet also oddly soothing, and I thought it might help me focus on the history essay I needed to finish for school.

As I kept typing away on my laptop, I suddenly heard yelling and shouting. I paused, my fingers hovering over the keyboard, and groaned quietly to myself.

""Not again.""

I got up from my bed and walked out of my room, heading down the hall and downstairs, where the yelling grew louder.

As I turned the corner, I spotted my Mom and older brother Mark in the living room, arguing about something.

""Mom, I already told you I'm sorry! I should have called to let you know I’d be home late. I didn’t realize that party would go on until one in the morning!""

""And I’ve already told you that I don’t like you or your brother being out that late! Something terrible could have happened to you! For heaven's sake, you could have been killed or kidnapped, Marcus!""

Mom and Mark continued their argument, clearly oblivious to my presence. I sighed softly, contemplating whether to just turn around and let them sort it out.

Even though I was twenty-five and Mark was twenty-seven, Mom still treated us like children. She insisted we stay with her until we were both thirty, which infuriated us.

I felt a surge of frustration rising within me, and I cleared my throat as loudly as I could, causing Mom and Mark to stop arguing. They both turned to look at me.

""Oh my goodness, Daniel! I’m so sorry! Did we interrupt your studying?"" Mom asked, sounding genuinely concerned.

""I've been attempting to study for more than an hour, but I can't concentrate with you two bickering like children!""

Mark's face flushed a deep red; I could tell he was embarrassed about the situation, yet he was still angry with Mom and wouldn't cease his argument until he had expressed everything he wanted to say.

""We're sorry, sweetheart. I'm just trying to explain to your brother that staying out late isn't wise,"" Mom said.

I've always disliked that particular trait of Mom's—she's such a worrywart, if that's the right term, because she frets over everything, even the most trivial matters.

""You know what? I'll just head to the library. Maybe I can finish my essay there, and hopefully, there won't be anyone trying to tear each other apart!""

I nearly yelled the last part out of frustration as I turned and stormed back upstairs to my room to grab my things.

As I shoved my laptop and notebook into my bag, I muttered under my breath about the constant fighting and how I felt treated like a child.

Just as I was about to leave, I heard a knock on my bedroom door. I turned to see Mark leaning against the doorframe; I hadn't even noticed him come up behind me.

""Let me guess, Mom sent you up here to stop me from heading to the library,"" I remarked, glancing at him.

""Yep, she believes it's a terrible idea for you to go outside in this rainstorm because you might get sick or even struck by lightning, which is ridiculous, but she wouldn't listen when I told her that.""

I rolled my eyes and plopped down on my bed, slipping on my shoes and ensuring the straps were snug but not so tight that they were cutting into my feet.

""Honestly, I don't care what the worrywart or you think. I'm going to the library to finish my darn history essay without having to listen to another argument from either of you. Now, if you could do me a favor and tell Mom I'll be back before dinner, that would be great,"" I retorted.

Before my brother could respond, I got up, tossed my bag over my shoulder, and pushed past him, making my way downstairs to the main part of the house.

Mom was there, clearly waiting for me. I raised my hand to signal that I didn't want to hear her lecture and assured her I'd be home by dinner before stepping out onto the porch.

The only sounds I could hear were the rain and the rumbling thunder. I let out a soft sigh, double-checking that my bag was securely closed, then pulled up my hoodie and set off toward the city library.

""Who would have thought a library would be open on a weekend?""

After a few minutes of walking along the rain-soaked street, feeling the droplets on my head and back, I found myself in front of the library, a smile creeping onto my face.

The library always brought me joy; there was something magical about the aroma of aged paper and the soft murmurs of books that captivated me.

As I entered the library, I greeted the woman at the front desk. She returned my greeting with a smile, though I could sense she wasn't thrilled to see me looking so drenched.

I located a spot to settle down, and a few minutes later, my belongings were spread out on the desk as I began working on my essay.

In fact, my laptop remained tucked away in my bag while I attempted to proofread my notes before transferring them. I sighed quietly, frustrated that nothing seemed to make sense, and realized I needed some assistance.

I got up and approached the front desk, inquiring if there were any history encyclopedias available that could aid me with my school essay.

She informed me that all the history encyclopedias were located in the back corner of the library and advised me to be cautious while I was there since some of those books were quite ancient.

I nodded in agreement and made my way to the back corner. Upon arrival, I began to sift through the aisles, but all the books appeared either dull or I was certain they wouldn't be of any assistance to me.

Before long, I turned a corner and stumbled upon a section I had never seen before. It looked rather intimidating, as the overhead light was flickering and swaying back and forth.

I noticed a layer of dust on the shelf, and a few bugs scurried out from the shadows, rushing past me. I glanced at all the encyclopedias and couldn't help but smile.

""Perhaps one of these could be useful to me,"" I thought, grinning.

I began to pull encyclopedias off the shelf, examining their covers. Some I had read previously, while others were quite old, likely published when my mom was my age.

As I pushed one encyclopedia aside, something heavy tumbled down onto my foot, causing me to cry out in pain. I quickly slapped a hand over my mouth, not wanting to disrupt the tranquility.

I looked down and saw a thick, brown book lying on the ground. I bent down to pick it up and noticed it lacked any library codes or markings indicating ownership.

However, I soon realized how worn and tattered it was; the spine was cracked. I dusted off the cover and read the title, which sent a shiver down my spine.

""Prophetic Pages""

I opened the book and began flipping through the pages, each one yellowed with age and filled with handwritten notes and strange symbols that seemed to dance before my eyes.

As I continued to flip through the pages, I discovered that each one contained a detailed entry about the life and death of an individual. It struck me that the names were eerily familiar.

They were all people I knew—friends, family, acquaintances. I was in disbelief over what I was holding. When I turned to the next page, I nearly dropped the book on my feet once more.

""Timothy Green - Age 23 - Dies in a car accident on April 15th, 2023""

This page was dedicated to my childhood best friend, Timothy, or Tim, as I called him.

April 15th was tomorrow, and I could feel my heart pounding like a drum in my chest. I closed the book, trying to convince myself that this was just a cruel joke.

I glanced around the library, half-expecting someone to jump out and shout, ""Got you!"" But the aisles were empty. The only sounds were the rain tapping against the nearby window and my heavy breathing.

I came to the realization that I had to hurry home to call Tim and alert him about what was going to happen. I tucked the strange book under my arm and dashed back to the desk where my belongings were.

A few minutes later, I found myself sprinting down the street as fast as a guy who mainly plays video games and practices the trumpet can manage.

I began to ponder a multitude of thoughts: was any of this real? Was the book some sort of cursed object that the library had been concealing?

Upon arriving home, I rushed past Mark and Mom, who were in the kitchen preparing dinner. Thankfully, I didn’t hear them arguing, but I didn’t have the luxury of time to deal with that right now.

Once I reached my room, I tossed my bag and the Prophetic Pages book onto my desk, then grabbed my phone from the nightstand.

Without delay, I dialed Tim's number, my fingers trembling as the phone rang and rang. Just when I thought he wouldn’t pick up, I heard his voice on the other end.

""Dude, you need to listen to me; this is really important. Are you planning to go out tonight?"" I asked him.

Timothy excitedly explained that he was actually going to see a new horror movie that had just been released and suggested I join him if I was done being Mr. History.

I took a deep breath and pleaded with him to stay home, urging him not to drive anywhere and to just remain safe at home. Tim immediately laughed, teasing me about turning into my mother.

I was on the verge of telling him about the peculiar book I discovered at the library, but I knew he wouldn’t believe me. Just then, I heard Mom calling my name, so I told Tim I had to go, and he hung up.

I let out a soft sigh before glancing down at the Prophetic Pages book. Deep down, I feared it might already be too late for my childhood best friend.

I heard Mom calling my name again, so I set my phone back on the nightstand. I then walked out of my room and saw Mom standing at the foot of the stairs.

She informed me that dinner was ready and that she had been calling for me for two minutes, urging me to come downstairs before my food got cold.

At the table, I sat there pushing my peas around my plate with a fork while Mom and Mark were engaged in conversation, but I was focused on them.

My mind was occupied with thoughts of the dangerous book from the library, Tim's disbelief, and the looming possibility of losing my best friend, either tomorrow or maybe even tonight.

""Hey little bro, what's up with you?"" Mark inquired.

I jumped in my seat, nearly falling out, but I managed to keep my composure because I knew if I hit the ground, Mom would treat me like a little baby.

""Oh, I'm just pondering my history essay. I found some intriguing information at the library, and I think it will help me score a good grade,""

I couldn't share the details about the so-called death book because neither of them would believe me, especially since Tim never believed me when I warned him about his fate.

After dinner, I headed back to my room, sat on the bed, grabbed the book, and flipped to the page detailing Tim's death.

I kept staring at it, wondering if it was real or if I could tear the page out and somehow prevent it from happening, like some sort of paradox.

But then I remembered that this book was indeed from the library, and I had borrowed it, yet it lacked any library barcodes or scanning tags, so perhaps it didn't actually belong to the library.

I let out a soft sigh before placing the book on my nightstand, getting ready for bed, and soon I was lying in the dark bedroom, thinking about Tim and the terrible car accident that awaited him on April 15th.

The next morning, as I woke up, sunlight streamed through my window. I sat up, rubbed my eyes, and yawned. Instantly, I turned around, glancing at my phone, my thoughts immediately drifting to Tim.

I could hear my heartbeat pounding in my ears. I quickly grabbed my phone and texted Tim, checking if he was alright and if he had enjoyed the movie. I anticipated a swift response, but there was nothing.

Throughout the day, I kept waiting for Tim to either call or text me, but still, no reply came. Panic began to creep in, and I muttered in frustration under my breath.

I made the decision to call Tim's home phone. However, instead of him picking up, it was his mother. When I inquired about Timothy's whereabouts, I heard her gasp in horror.

She informed me that Tim had been involved in a car accident while driving to the grocery store, and the paramedics said he didn’t survive.

In that moment, I felt my legs buckle beneath me. I leaned against the wall, sliding down until I collapsed onto the floor.

The Prophetic Pages had spoken the truth, and it had come to pass. The book had foretold his death, and despite my efforts, I couldn’t save my best friend from dying.

The very next day, I found myself back at the library, enveloped in a fog of sorrow and disbelief, desperate to comprehend what had just transpired.

I settled into the same desk as before, retrieving the book from my bag, gazing at it before I began to leaf through the yellowed pages once more.

Each page contained a meticulous account of the life and death of various individuals; some were familiar to me, while others were not. Yet, each entry represented a friend or family member who would meet their end in unique circumstances, all described in vivid detail.

As I continued to turn the pages, I suddenly halted on one that sent a chill through my hands, almost compelling me to hurl the book across the room.

""Jessica Carter - Age 25 - Dies from an aneurysm on April 16th, 2023""

In that moment, I understood that this page detailed the death of my girlfriend, Jessica.

A shiver coursed through me as I recalled the last time I saw Jessica; we were at the coffee shop, sharing laughter over something silly.

Without hesitation, I jumped up, stuffed the book into my bag, and fished my phone out of my pocket to dial Jessica's number.

""Hey Daniel, what's up? I'm at work right now,"" her voice came through.

""Listen, whatever you're doing, you need to stop or head home. You're in danger!""

I rushed to explain about the book I discovered in the library, detailing how it revealed the deaths of all my friends and family, including her.

I then told her I found Tim's name in the book, and that he died in a car accident yesterday, just as the book predicted for that exact date.

""Whoa, Daniel, I think you've been watching too many horror movies. But when you get to the restaurant, at least bring me that so-called mystical book you have,"" Jessica said before hanging up.

I felt an urge to scream into the emptiness. I urged my feet to run, wishing I had brought my car or something quicker than my clumsy feet. When I finally reached the restaurant, I doubled over, gasping for breath.

As I looked up, I saw a crowd gathered around the entrance, and confusion washed over me. Were they having a sale, or was there a fight going on?

I was indifferent to the commotion; my only focus was finding Jessica to show her the book. I squeezed through the throng and entered the restaurant, where I noticed paramedics and medical personnel, along with an area cordoned off by barriers.

I couldn't see what was happening due to another crowd blocking my view, so I tapped an older man on the shoulder. He turned to me, concern etched on his face.

""Sir, what’s going on?""

""One of the workers just collapsed, and the paramedics think she’s dead,"" he replied.

The moment he mentioned 'she,' my heart plummeted. I pushed through the crowd, and there on the ground, eyes closed and lifeless, lay Jessica.

""No, Jessica!"" I yelled, my voice echoing in the chaos.

Instantly, the paramedics and medical staff turned to me. One approached and asked if I knew her.

I told her I was Jessica's boyfriend, that I had just spoken to her on the phone moments ago, urging her to leave work because it wasn't safe. I was rambling, overwhelmed, and I stopped when the paramedic placed her hands on my shoulders.

""Young man, it’s okay. You should know what happened. Your girlfriend has died from an aneurysm, and there was nothing we could do to save her. I’m so sorry,"" the paramedic said.

The book felt like a dark oracle, revealing its grim secrets, and I thought about showing it to this woman. But if I did, she would likely bombard me with questions I couldn’t answer.

So, I thanked her and, without another word, pushed past everyone and exited the restaurant, furious that this cursed book had claimed yet another person I loved.

Weeks later, the unsettling pattern persisted; each page revealed the demise of a victim who was more familiar to me than Jessica.

I had become a captive of the book, unable to resist the allure of its sinister knowledge. It felt as if it understood my sorrow, with the ink appearing darker on every page.

Then, I stumbled upon a page that shattered my heart into countless fragments upon seeing the name of the individual.

""Marcus Roberts - Age 27 - Died of a heart attack on April 30th 2023""

I realized that was tonight once again, and I leaped out of bed, rushing to brother's room, where I found him lacing up his shoes.

""Dude, where are you going? It's almost nine o'clock at night?""

""Can’t sleep. Thinking about going for a late-night run. Be back soon.""

I pleaded with him not to venture outside tonight, insisting it was too perilous. Mark chuckled, saying I was becoming like Mom, but I was just terrified of losing my brother.

After an hour had passed, I found myself in the kitchen assisting Mom in preparing her renowned double chocolate chip cookies, and I could see that she appeared anxious about something.

I inquired about what was troubling her, and she revealed that Mark had not returned from his walk nor had he sent her a message as he had promised to do when he was on his way back home.

I sensed what was about to unfold, and I knew I had to intervene. I looked at Mom and told her I needed to take care of something urgent, to which she simply nodded in agreement.

Without another word, I quickly put on my jacket and shoes, then dashed out of the house. My breath came in quick, uneven gasps as I sprinted toward the park, Mark's favorite place to walk.

As I neared the park, I spotted a figure lurking in the shadows, and my heart raced in my chest. When I turned the corner, I found him lying on the ground, clutching his chest.

""MARK!"" I yelled.

I hurried to my brother, but deep down, I already knew it was too late for him. That dreadful book had taken yet another victim, and this time, it was my brother.

I was descending into madness; first, my two friends were taken from me, and then my brother. The loss of my loved ones was a heavy burden on my emotions.

That’s when an idea struck me. I seized the book and made my way back to the library one last time, desperate for answers. The main librarian, an elderly woman, looked up at me with her piercing green eyes.

""What is this book? Why is it causing all of this?"" 

I slammed the Prophetic Pages onto the desk. Initially, the lady remained silent, but as she took the book and examined it, her expression shifted, and she regarded me with a serious look.

""Young man, where did you come across this book?"" 

""I was here last time searching for history encyclopedias when this book fell off the shelf and landed on my foot. But you still haven’t answered my question: what is this book?!"" 

""That’s the Prophetic Pages. It has always existed, young man. It chronicles the lives that are intertwined with yours and predicts not only death but also the weight of the choices and paths we take,"" the librarian clarified.

""This isn’t a choice; it’s a curse!"" I shouted in frustration.

""Perhaps it is, or perhaps it isn’t. But understand this: that book only reveals what is already destined. It’s not the cause but a reflection of the choices you’ve made and the connections you’ve established,"" she replied.

I took a step back, my mind racing. Had I somehow cursed all those deaths of my loved ones without realizing it? 

Was I in some way accountable for the choices they made or the paths they chose? 

""Can I change this? Is there any way to stop it"" I inquired.

""The only way to put an end to this situation is to cut off the connections, but it comes at a cost, young man"".

Her words seemed to penetrate deep within me, and without uttering a single word, I turned away from the desk, leaving my book behind in the library.

I came to the realization that I had to create distance from everyone I cared about. I needed to sever ties with them, even though it felt like a betrayal; it was the only way to protect them all.

In the following weeks, I dedicated my days and nights to solitude. Whenever I encountered someone I recognized, I would steer clear of them, and I ignored their calls and messages.

This was torturous, yet it brought a sense of relief as I observed that no one around me was perishing, and I felt assured that my loved ones were safe.

Then one day, as I went to my bedroom to indulge in some video games, I discovered the Prophetic Pages book lying on my bed, and I felt as if I could melt into a puddle.

I hurried over to it, picked it up, and as I examined the cover, my hands trembled while I opened the book and flipped straight to the last page.

To my surprise, it was entirely blank, leaving me puzzled. Recalling what the librarian had said, I touched the paper and watched in amazement as the information began to materialize before my eyes.

When I saw the name of the next person destined to die, my jaw dropped in disbelief.

Daniel Roberts - 25 years old - Passed away from loneliness on May 15, 2023

The book slipped from my grasp; that date was tomorrow. I couldn't fathom it. I felt as if I might either vomit or weep like a child.

The realization hit me like a massive wave. I had been so focused on saving my friends and loved ones that I had unwittingly sealed my own doom.

I needed to cut myself off entirely from everyone, even my mother, who was thankfully still alive. But I was destined to become a mere ghost.

A mere shadow of who I used to be. This book had twisted my intentions, transforming my wish to protect into a sentence of death.

The following day, I found myself sitting alone on the floor of my bedroom, feeling the darkness creeping in, coiling around me like a serpent.

I reminisced about my friends and brothers, recalling the laughter and memories we had created together. It dawned on me that I had forsaken them all, and in doing so, I had condemned myself.

Mom attempted to coax me out of my room, but nothing she said had any effect. As night descended, I sensed the air becoming thick and oppressive.

Suddenly, I heard whispers—likely from that dreadful book—echoing in my mind, the pages shifting as if they were alive.

I let out a soft sigh, rising to my feet and moving to my nightstand where the Prophetic Pages lay. I began flipping through the book, only to find it completely blank, and I realized I was about to join them.

I shut the book and hurled it to the ground, confronting the horrifying truth: I had become a prisoner of my own decisions, a victim of fate. As the sudden darkness enveloped me, I grasped the meaning of it all.

The real terror did not stem from the foretold deaths but from the isolation I had chosen to accept.

But now it was too late. I had become a new edition of the Prophetic Pages, destined for a solitary conclusion. As I sank into the shadows, I finally understood how to escape the curse of the Prophetic Pages.",1,1759292744.0,nosleep,1,0.67,False

1nuyriy,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExpatsinEthiopia/comments/1nuyriy/exploring_addis_ababas_markets_from_mercato_to/,Exploring Addis Ababa’s Markets: From Mercato to Modern Supermarkets,"If you’re in Addis Ababa, whether as an expat, traveler, or curious local, you’ll quickly discover that shopping here is as much about culture as it is about buying things. The city’s markets range from sprawling open-air chaos to sleek, modern supermarkets. Here’s a quick guide to some of the best known spots:

**Mercato**  
This is Africa’s largest open-air market, covering nearly 5 km². It’s a whirlwind of color, sound, and energy. You’ll find sections for spices and coffee, metalwork and recycling, textiles, enset (false banana) products, and just about everything else you can imagine. It’s chaotic, crowded, and not really geared toward tourists, but if you want to experience Ethiopian daily life, this is the place. Bring patience, curiosity, and maybe a local guide.

**Shola Market**  
Smaller and more relaxed than Mercato, Shola offers a friendlier pace while still being full of life. You’ll find fresh produce, woven baskets, spices, and traditional clothing. It’s also a good spot to pick up souvenirs like jewelry and handicrafts without the overwhelming crowds.

**Shiromeda Market**  
If you’re looking for traditional Ethiopian clothing and textiles, Shiromeda (near the American Embassy) is the go-to spot. Handmade dresses, scarves, and fabrics fill the stalls. Bargaining is expected and part of the fun, and prices are usually reasonable compared to tourist shops.

**Modern Supermarkets**  
Not all shopping in Addis happens in open-air markets. The city has a growing list of modern supermarkets that stock imported goods, specialty items, and everyday essentials. Shoa, Friendship Hypermarket, Bambis, Lomyad, and many others are popular with both expats and locals who want a more predictable shopping experience.

1nuyrh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1nuyrh6/to_accept_and_let_go/,To accept and let go,"I have two choices. To let myself sit longer in my pain and sadness and just keep letting your decisions hurt me or I just let you be. Let you do what you need to do in your own life and focus on my self and how I can let you go. 

Yes all this shit you’re doing is not fair and your actions and decisions still impact me but maybe as the days go by it will get better. It will feel less heavy. Then one day I truly won’t care about your actions. Because I need to stop crashing out on a man that honestly was not a good partner to me. There were more cons than pros in the relationship. I literally was anxious around him, waiting to see when he would leave again. There was constant silence and I always questioned if that was normal in a relationship. I kept making excuses for why he behaved that way or why our relationship kept going the route that it did. Yes around people we were great and it felt good but maybe it was because the people surrounding us played as buffers and behind closed doors it was more silence and no growth. I planned everything thinking that would help us grow but really it was just to fill the void..to find things to do with you hoping you would pay attention to me and our relationship but I still felt empty and alone during those “fun times” because I could just feel that you were not in it anymore. You haven’t been in it for years and I could just feel you just forcing to be happy and present with me. We can’t even just have a nice/nonesense conversations. I’m sitting here at a coffee shop listening to these two people just talking and communicating about everyday things and we couldn’t even do that. Our phones became our safe space, I know it was mine. There was so many red flags throughout our relationship but I turned a blind eye because I just wanted to keep you soooooo bad. And most likely it was due to attachment and not love. Due to knowing we’ve been together for 11 years and no one just throws that out!? 

But you did so quickly and so I should respect myself and move on too. Yes it’s easier said than done but I NEED to. For my sake and for the sake of our daughter we created. It sucks that she was created during these circumstances but I love this girl so much and I want to pour all my love to her instead of dwelling on the why’s you couldn’t love me and why I couldn’t be your person when I was so sure you were mine.
