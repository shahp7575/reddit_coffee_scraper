1ob6dy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_the_yarn_winder/comments/1ob6dy8/im_a_paranoid_schizophrenic_im_not_sure_if_my/,I'm a paranoid schizophrenic. I'm not sure if my house is haunted.,"When I was diagnosed with schizophrenia, I was actually relieved. For months I had felt the closing maw of isolation. Fleeting feelings of fear and disgust had swirled on and off through my head for at least a year, slowly shutting me off from the rest of the world. It felt like the world was watching me fall in on myself, and it looked on with indifference.

The day before the first doctor's appointment, my sister found me in my apartment barricaded in the bedroom. She had to get the groundskeeper to use bolt cutters on the door's chain lock just to get inside, and when she did finally get to the bedroom door I was less than cooperative. It took both her and the groundskeeper pushing on the door to move my bed out of the way, and from there it took another 20 minutes to talk me out of the room itself. When I emerged from the bedroom, I was filthy. Unwashed, hair matted, with a shaky grasp on what was happening at best. I can't remember most of what I saw and heard in the three days that I was locked in that apartment, and I think that's probably for the best.

My sister took me back to her house and let me shower and change there. Over the course of the day, I came back to myself. Then, over the course of the next 3 months, my doctors ruled out a host of other possibilities before landing squarely on paranoid schizophrenia. It was surprisingly freeing to have an answer to the issues I had faced, to have a clear path forward and a new direction for my life. Everything was looking up.

After my breakdown, I moved out of my apartment for good. Even though I knew that the shadows in my peripheral vision and the eyes peeking through the blinds were all in my head, I couldn't shake the dark feeling I got from staying there. I moved in with my sister for a few months, much to the chagrin of her husband. Even tough he was sympathetic, he didn't like the idea of a nutcase living with them. Especially not with a kid on the way. I can't say I blamed him.

That takes me to about 5 months ago. I was looking for a place to stay when I saw an ad in the newspaper for a house that recently went up for sale. The owner died in a nursing home, and the estate was set to sell the house off and divide the earnings between his children. The house itself wasn't anything impressive, just a one story slab house in the woods about 10 minutes outside of town. It wasn't isolated by any means, having at least two houses within a quarter mile of it. But it was cheap after a few years of abandonment according to the real estate agent. I decided to ask for a showing and told my sister about it.

""Are you sure you're ready to live alone again? You're welcome to stay here, we could use an extra set of hands around the house anyways since I can't be on my feet for too long.""

""What, not ready to lose your personal chef just yet?""

She let out a little chuckle, but I could tell she was worried. I felt wholly indebted to her for her kindness. Moving out was the first step in my mind to repaying her.

""Look, I'll be fine. I've got a pretty good handle on things. Besides, I can tell I've overstayed my welcome.""

""Who told you that? Jeff?""

""Believe me, he didn't have to. Besides, I'm pretty sure this little guy doesn't want to have to share a room with his uncle.""

My sister looked down at her swollen belly. The due date was less than 2 moths away and I could tell she was weighing the truth of my words against her perceived responsibility to me.

""Okay, but take lots of pictures for me.""

""Absolutely. I'll be back in a few hours.""

And with that, I was out the door and driving down the road. Anxiety coursed through my body, but I also felt incredibly optimistic. This felt like stepping into the light at the end of the tunnel. I finally felt a sense of normalcy after months of constant issues. I cannot begin to describe to you the amount of hope I felt in this moment.

The drive out of town took about 10 minutes, the dive to the house another 10. 20 minutes either way for a Walmart run was going to take some getting used to, but if the price in the newspaper ad was accurate then the additional gas money and miles on my car would be well worth it. Before my breakdown I had never even hoped to afford a house on an accountant's salary, but this was an opportunity for that dream to come true as well. Sure, the house probably needed some work, but I was eager to take on the challenge anyways. I quickly found out just how much of a challenge it would actually be.

When my phone told me to turn into the driveway, I had to stop in the middle of the road and look for it. There barely seemed to be any gaps in the trees, and the grass was almost as tall as the hood of my car. it took me a minute, but I finally saw the beginning of tire tracks leading into the grass and between two trees. I carefully maneuvered my car down an incredibly overgrown and bumpy driveway. As I cleared the initial line of trees, I could see a house rising above the tall grass about 100 yards from the road. It was bigger than I was expecting, with worn cedar siding and a green steel roof. The windows were covered in dirt and cobwebs, preventing me from seeing anything inside while I sat in my car.

I called the realtor just to be sure I was at the right place, and she told me she was just up the road and would be pulling in behind me soon. I pulled up a picture of the ad from the newspaper and read it again. It described the house as a ""secluded estate"" with ""cottage vibes"". That description seemed like a bit of a stretch now. I was imagining something more... refined. This was less of a secluded cottage and more of a abandoned crack house. But I wasn't dissuaded at all.

The real estate agent pulled in behind me just a few minutes later. She stepped out of a rather beat up suburban and put her cigarette out in what she was trying to sell as my future yard. She then adjusted her long, curly bleach-blond hair (think ramen noodles) and walked over to shake my hand.

""Are you Brandon?""

""Yes ma'am.""

""Alright, glad to meet you! I'm Tara. Let's take a look, shall we?""

Her faux bubbly enthusiasm was betrayed by her smoker's rasp and tired eyes. She walked to the back of her SUV and opened it. I followed her back, confused as to what she could possibly need from back there. She had to move over a pile of children's baseball bats and travel ball bags to get to the particular duffel bag she wanted. She dug inside for a moment, then pulled out a wad of blue nitrile gloves and some N95 masks. I was taken aback.

""I-is it really that bad in there?""

""Oh, no no no. It's just dusty, plays hell with my allergies. The inspector cleared it of any mold or rodent problems. It's completely safe.""

I took the gloves hesitantly, less and less sure of my intentions to buy. She shut the gate on her vehicle to reveal 4 different travel ball jersey numbers. No wonder she looked so tired.

I followed her through the tall grass and up onto the porch. The steps and porch were both old and weather beaten, but seemed structurally fine. From the top of the stairs I could see the house better. It was at least 2 foot off the ground and resting on blocks, with vents cut into the cedar siding and covered by chicken wire. I'm assuming they were places to access the crawl space under the house. The windows were all old single pane affairs, but I didn't see any that were broken. Green shutters hung on both sides of each window, some hanging down from a broken hinge.

While I was checking out the house, Tara was struggling with the door. She had already gotten the key out of the lockbox, but even with the door unlocked it seemed to not want to budge. I only noticed when she took a step back and threw her whole shoulder into the door, causing it to open just a crack.

""Woah, are you okay? Do you need help?""

""Oh I'm fine sweetheart, this door just gets stuck when it's been dry for too long. The soil here dries and swells with the rain, and that will cause the house to shift a little. It's all in the inspector's report. It's nothing to worry about too much, once we get some rain it'll open a lot easier.""

She threw her hip into the door and it fully gave way into a decently spacious living room. She was right about the dust, it was quite bad. There were cobwebs hanging from ceiling fan and several sets of footprints leading all through the room towards various parts of the house. The house was fully furnished, but it was hard to tell what would be salvageable. Lack of power and humid Louisiana weather had ruined many of the wooden furnishings in the room. I was shocked that there was no mold, the conditions were ripe for it.

""Well, this is the living room."" Tara began, her voice muffled by the mask. ""You can see through those doors the dining room and kitchen, and to the left over here is one of the bathrooms and two of the bedrooms.""

I walked slowly towards the kitchen/dining room trying to soak in the feel of the house. The walls were old wood paneling and the floors were badly damaged linoleum. The whole place felt old, but in a nostalgic way rather than a bad one. I stepped through one of the two doors that lead to the dining room and kitchen and was immediately struck by the large bay window.

It was dilapidated, definitely in need of replacing, but through it was an incredible view of the main attraction of the house. In the back yard past the covered back porch and at the bottom of a shallow hill was a sizable oxbow lake. The water was placid, reflecting the pink hues of the afternoon sun in the most incredible way. I stood in front of it admiring the beauty for a moment.

""Like what you see?""

""The view is great."" I said, leaning against the frame of the window. ""Window leaves a bit to be desired though. How long has it been since anyone's been in here again?""

""Two years. The owner had a health event and ended up in hospice for most of that, but it's taken a few months for the estate to settle everything and get it on the market.""

""Why didn't the family take care of the place while he was in hospice?""

""I'm not supposed to say this but the owner was 96 and his youngest child was 72. Grandchildren and great grandchildren were all out of state and the one son who was in state just wasn't able to keep up with the place.""

""Okay, that makes sense. What's over here to the right?""

""That's the third bedroom and master bedroom, and over here on the left is a laundry room""

I walked through the bedrooms, bathrooms, checked out the back porch, you get the gist. The place was dirty, outdated, and in need of structural work, but even with all that on my mind I couldn't stop thinking about the view from the bay window. I could imagine myself sitting in front of that window in the morning with a cup of coffee. What a peaceful thought.

I left fully intending to place an offer, and two weeks later I was signing papers and picking up keys.

It took about a month of cleaning and a few big immediate fixes before I could move in finally, but I managed to get out of my sister's house just in time for them to repaint the room powder blue and put all the baby furniture together. A week later and I was in the hospital with them for the delivery. Everything felt peaceful again. Everything felt right. But almost immediately after the baby was born things started to go south for me.

It started with auditory hallucinations. I would be in my bedroom and hear whispers from the kitchen, but of course nobody was there. Then, things started to go missing or get moved around. I had trouble concentrating when I was home alone. I started to worry that moving out was a bad idea, but I couldn't tell my sister that. So I kept my symptoms to myself, even as the nightmares began.

I remember the first one vividly, even now. I woke up in my bed and sat up, shivering. The air stung with a bitter and damp cold that chilled me right to the bone. I looked over to my right, and sitting in the doorway was a little girl. She had long, black hair that was dripping wet, and she wore a white night gown. She sat with her knees pressed against her chest facing away from me and towards the closed door. Her breaths came out in strained, wheezing gasps. For some reason I still can't explain, I was filled with an unnatural calm. I stood up from the bed still, shaking violently from the cold. I slowly walked towards her, and reached out my hand to grab her hair. Taking a big handful of hair, I realized I couldn't feel my hand getting wet.

""This... is a dream"" I whispered, struggling against every word.

And then I woke up, shaking violently as my heart beat hard against my ribcage. I don't know why I was so upset, it wasn't a particularly scary dream. As I sat in my bed, I could still feel the icy chill against my skin. I stood up and went into the hallway to look at the thermostat. It read 48 degrees. The heat was on, but when I reached up to the vent I could feel the frigid air pouring out. *Perfect, more shit for me to fix.*

I turned the heat off and threw on a pair of sweatpants and a thick jacket before taking my quilt off the bed and wrapping it around me. Slowly I moved to the kitchen. Pockets of cold air seeped up through the floor in places where the insulation under the house had fallen out, making the floor cold as ice against my feet. I threw open the door to the oven and set it to 400 degrees before popping down with my back against the corner cabinet and my feet tucked into the blanket. The house, as old as it was, had been ""updated"" to have no gas, so this was the best I could do to keep warm.

At some point I nodded off because I snapped awake to my alarm blaring from the bedroom. Falling asleep with the stove on was definitely not the proudest moment I've had, but the house was considerably warmer. I jumped up, turned the stove off, and hurriedly got ready for work. Just before I left the house, I stood in front of the large picture frame window I got to replace the collapsing bay window and admired the early morning sun as it was reflected off the lake.

As I looked more closely, absorbing every detail, I saw something strange in the water. It almost looked like a mop of long, black hair just poking out of the water. I could even just barely see the beginnings of a pale, sickly looking nose jutting out of it.

I dropped my coffee cup and ran over to the back door, but by the time I threw it open and jumped out onto the back porch the hair was gone. I scanned over the water, looking at every shadow and reflection, but there was nothing out there. The water was completely still as it had been on the day I first viewed the house.

I could feel the panic building in my chest. A deep, primordial part of me knew with absolute certainty that something was in that water, but I couldn't trust that. I knew I couldn't trust that. I took several deep breaths, grabbing onto one of the posts for the porch so that I could feel the wood grain against my palm. I focused on grounding myself, understanding what was real, and calming down. Panic wouldn't help me right now.

As I stood on the porch looking at the lake, everything looked so incredibly normal. The unease finally began to fade, and my heart returned to it's normal pace. It wasn't real. I could let it go and move on. By the time I go to work, it seemed almost silly, seeing a girl from my dreams in the lake. But she wouldn't stay there.

I left work early to meet someone to repair my broken heater. I had no intention of freezing my ass off for another night. While he worked on the unit, I made a late lunch and made a lap around the house looking at the siding. I had barely fixed the place up enough to make it livable, and the rest I had to save up to work on. I was trying to decide whether the siding or windows would come next when I felt like something was watching from the woods behind me.

I froze, too terrified to move. The feeling came on so suddenly, and I could feel it with such certainty. As I stood there, absolutely still, I could feel the thing that was watching me get closer. Dry, new fallen leaves crunched in the pattern of footsteps, and I could feel it's presence almost pressing against my back. from the corner of my vision, I saw shadows closing in around my head. But before the shadows could leave my periphery and enter my vision, another shape came in quickly from the side.

""There you are sir.""

I jumped so hard I almost fell, letting out a terrified yelp. Immediately I whipped around to look behind me, my back pressed against the house. I scanned the trees for anything, but there was nothing there. No dark figures peeked out from behind the mass of trunks.

""Are you okay sir? I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to scare you there. But to be fair, you scared me bout half to death yourself.""

I leaned forward, resting my hands against my knees and struggling against every breath. ""I'm fine, sorry. I just... wasn't expecting you.""

I let out a pitiful chuckle. This must look like such a ridiculous overreaction to him. I stood upright, taking my weight off the house, and faced him.

""Well, uh, I took a look at your unit. I couldn't see a thing wrong with it. You said it was blowing cold air last night?""

""Yeah, it was freezing.""

""Well, these old heat pump units will go into defrost mode and blow cold air for a few moments sometimes. That's usually only when it g-""

""No no, it wasn't blowing cold for a minute, it was blowing cold air for a while. When I got up the thermostat said 48 degrees.""

As I spoke, I could see his brow furrow in confusion.

""Well if it was blowing cold for a while then the reversing valve could have been stuck, but I already took a look at it and it can't be more than a few years old. And if it was the reversing valve getting stuck, I don't know how it would have gotten your place down to 48 when it was 65 last night. I'm gonna take a look at that thermostat, it sounds like it might have an issue too.""

""Okay, thank you"" I said, relieved that I wouldn't be replacing the whole unit. ""I'll be inside in a minute.""

He gave me a nod and turned to head back inside. I watched as he rounded the corner, then I turned my attention back to the woods. I leaned my back against the house and scanned all the trees again. Even though there was nothing there, I was still rattled by what had just happened. I'd never had a hallucination like that before, one that I could feel pressing into me. It was overwhelming.

The repair man didn't stay much longer. In then end he replaced the thermostat, but he couldn't find any issues with the heat pump itself. After he left I sat on the front porch for a while staring at the empty corn field across the highway. A cold breeze rattled the dead leaves that still clung to the trees. Usually I found this time of year so comfortable, but I couldn't make myself relax. I thought that once I got my medication and treatment plan everything could go back to normal, or at least near that. This was the point where I realized that wouldn't be the case.

That night I checked the heat to make sure it worked. The house had very little insulation and even when the nights weren't that cold it seemed like frigid drafts would creep in from every crack and seam. This time the warm air flowed without issue. By the time I crawled into bed the room was quite comfortable, and I quickly drifted into a dreamless sleep.

In the middle of the night, I found myself slowly waking up. I looked around the room, confused, but there was nothing there. I tried to sit up and found I couldn't move. Every muscle was too weak, too heavy. Then I felt it, pressing into my back. An imposing figure loomed everywhere behind me, just beyond my peripheral vision. I tried to free myself, but my body only got weaker and heavier. It felt like I was being pulled into the mattress. I tried to cry out for help, but my jaw could barely move and my voice came out as a whisper.

Then, two long slender arms rose from out of the bed from either side of my head. They were cloaked in shadow but I could still see the pale, taught skin that covered them. They bent at the elbows, and the hands came down to cover my eyes. It felt like a weight was pressing into my chest. I could barely breathe. I heard a voice from behind me:

*Count*

I lay completely still, trembling. Suddenly there was pressure on my neck, as if a belt had been wrapped around it.

*COUNT*

I took a shaky breath and then began to count.

""One... Two... Three...""

Each word came out as a strained whisper. With each number my body got heavier, breathing got harder, and the hands pulled back harder on my head.

""Four... Five... Six... Seven...""

My throat burned and my voice grew weaker. I could feel the palms pressing hard into my eyes, causing flashes of red and orange in my vision. I was gasping for breath between every word.

""Eight...""

I felt like I was drowning. Every fiber of my body was screaming in pain. I thought for the first time since the apartment that I might die.

""Nine...""

At this point I was holding on by a thread. Everything started to fade. My body felt like it was in freefall.

*Ten*

The last number I could only mouth. My vocal cords refused to move.

Suddenly I shot up in bed, gasping for breath. I shuffled backwards until my back was pressed against the wall and desperately searched the room for anything out of place. my heart felt like it was stuck in my throat, and sweat poured down my body.

I didn't go back to sleep that night. I sat in the bed trembling for hours, focusing on the texture of the wall against my back and the feel of the fabric on my legs. I saw shadows walking in my peripheral vision and heard voices whispering in adjacent rooms but I ignored them. They didn't feel real, not in the way that dream did. As I calmed down, the hallucinations stopped. I sat awake in bed until the sun finally came peeking through the windows.

I decided shortly after waking up that I would be calling in sick. I hated to do that to my boss, especially after he was so understanding during my mental crisis earlier in the year. But I needed to talk to someone about what was happening. I got dressed and texted my sister to let her know I would be coming over. I hated to lean on her again like this, especially so soon after the baby was born, but I was adrift in my own mind. I needed something, anything to grab onto.

\-

""Sleep paralysis? You've never had that before now have you?""

""No, never. It was... awful. It didn't feel like a hallucination it felt visceral, like I was going to die.""

""Jesus, that sounds horrible. I'm so sorry Brandon.""

I could see the concern in her tired eyes. I could tell she had been getting even less sleep than me. I hated to dump this on her, but I really didn't have anywhere else to turn at this point.

""Have you talked to your therapist about this yet?""

""Uhh, no sis. It happened this morning. How would I have?""

""Ah, shit, right. Sorry.""

At this point I felt so incredibly stupid for even coming over here over what had been, ultimately, a bad dream. She was exhausted, barely coherent, and I decided to come bother her yet again.

""When are you going to tell him? When's your next appointment?""

""Tuesday.""

I lied. I felt bad for it, but I couldn't tell her that I hadn't seen my therapist for over a month. He didn't agree that I was ready to move out, but I couldn't stay here and continue to burden my sister. Even though I was worried he was right, he had to be wrong. I needed him to be wrong. But he wasn't.

I stayed and helped my sister around the house for a while. I cleaned, did the laundry, I even cooked for her. All to avoid going home. I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something deeply wrong with that house. I did everything I could to delay it, but eventually I had to leave and I once again found myself making the long drive out to the secluded house I called home.

When I pulled into the driveway, I could feel my heart rate elevate. I spent 20 minutes in my car working up the courage to walk into my own house. When I finally did leave the car, I walked up the porch to the door, unlocked it, and immediately ran into it. Shocked, I tested the deadbolt to find it was definitely unlocked. *Great*, I thought, *in the time I was gone somehow the ground dried enough to seal the door shut again.*

The door had been a little difficult to open this morning, but this seemed ridiculous. I turned the knob and threw my hip into the door, but it didn't budge. Not even when I threw my full weight against it. After trying a few times, I threw my hands up in frustration and started walking around to the back door. Thankfully that door was unaffected by the ground's swelling.

The moon shone bright overhead, illuminating the path around the side of the house. Shadows danced between the trees, but I tried to ignore that. I only thought about getting inside so I could make some apple cider and watch the trees waving in the lake's reflection. but when I turned the corner to the back of the house, I realized I could only barely see the lake at all. A thick fog seemed to be rising from the water, one that was unaffected by the wind.

I slowed down and looked closer, a bit astonished. As I looked into the fog, I thought I could just make out something rising from the water of the lake. It looked like a dark mass of moss, until I saw the white night gown below it. My heart rate started to climb, but even still I walked over to the edge of the hill leading down to the lake. I knew the second that I saw her rising out of the lake that it was the same girl that I saw in my dream, and the same uncanny sense of calm washed over me.

I could feel her call drawing me towards the water, and every muscle in my body screamed out for me to follow her voice. Even with the biting cold of the wind burned against my cheeks. Even when I reached the edge of the fog and I felt it start to freeze against my skin. My body pulled me all the way to the edge of the lake, and I stopped with the cold water just in front of my feet.

I felt like a prisoner in my own mind. Something deep inside me screamed out that I needed to stop, that I shouldn't go in the water, but her pull was stronger than reason. What finally snapped me out of it was feeling the cold water rush through my shoes. I fell backwards onto the shore and scrambled away from the water, shivering violently in the cold.

I turned and Ran up the hill, onto the porch, and pulled out my keys. Just before unlocking the door, I looked back and saw the girl from the lake standing at the top of the hill next to a tree. Panicking, I unlocked the door and threw it open, slamming it behind me and locking it shut. I even left the keys in the lock, something I would regret later on.

Inside, the house was almost colder than outside. My breath hung thick in the air, almost like smoke. From the large picture frame window I saw the girl still standing by the tree. A thick fog rolled in from behind her, limiting visibility until nothing could be seen outside the house at all, only an eerie gray screen. The house was still, dark, and quiet. The only sound I could hear was my own teeth chattering.

I took off my wet shoes and socks only to find the floor cold as ice. In the hallway outside my bedroom I checked the thermostat to see that it read 24 degrees. The heat was set to on, but nothing was running. Flipping the light switch in the hallway didn't turn on the light, and looking over in the kitchen I could see the clock wasn't illuminated on the stove. I had no power.

I went into my bedroom and put on whatever warm clothing I could find. A sweater, a coat, wool socks, slippers, etc. Pacing the room, I tried to wrap my head around what was happening. Something was deeply wrong with me, I shouldn't be hallucinating so vividly. *Had my medication stopped working?* I don't know why that would happen so suddenly when I had no problems with it before. *Maybe I missed a dose?*

I looked towards the bathroom and noticed something square sticking out past the door frame. I grabbed a flashlight and shined it into the bathroom only for part of it to be shined back at me. What stuck out was a mirror, specifically the mirror for my medicine cabinet. *My medicine cabinet was open.*

I slowly walked into the bathroom and looked at the counter. In the sink, below the medicine cabinet, my pill bottle sat in the sink, open. The bottle sat completely empty, with the mouth facing the drain. I was completely out of Risperdal. It was Friday night long after my doctor had gone home and the pharmacy had closed and I was out of my antipsychotic.

I picked the pill bottle up and dropped to my knees, completely numb. *How? How had this happened?* Did I not put the cap on fully? Did I place the bottle on the edge of the shelf and it fell? Did I not close the medicine cabinet all the way?

Deep down I knew there was no way that all of that could have happened. No, these pills were dumped down the drain on purpose. There was something in this house with me, I wasn't delusional. I had to get out.

I stood up and walked towards the back door. As I passed through the kitchen and dining room, I could see the fog hadn't lifted. I knew that somewhere out there in the fog the girl from the lake was waiting for me, but I didn't care. I needed to get somewhere safe, somewhere far away from this house. Maybe a hotel or a hospital.

I got to the back door and reached for the deadbolt, but it wasn't there. In it's place was a keyhole, as if the lock had been flipped. A sick practical joke, and one I didn't find funny.

I reached for my phone but found my pocket empty. I went looking in the bedroom, the bathroom, all over, but then I remembered that I left it in my car where I had been listening to a podcast. The front door was stuck, the back door was locked, and I didn't have a way to call anyone for help. I was trapped inside.",1,1760921752.0,u_the_yarn_winder,0,1.0,False

1ob6bg9,https://i.redd.it/41gvfp2qz5wf1.jpeg,"No Brining, No Basting, Just Heart: Memories from My Mother‚Äôs Thanksgiving Yearly Miracle","**Please share your favorite Thanksgiving memories!**

TL/DR: We ate like kings in our single-wide. 

Thanksgiving morning in our single-wide was something between a Norman Rockwell painting and a minor kitchen fire waiting its time to break out. The oven kicked on before sunrise, mostly because it doubled as central heating. By the time the turkey smell hit the back bedrooms, the place was alive, steam on the windows, the furnace coughing to life, and my mother already muttering about timing like she was landing planes at O‚ÄôHare while searching for the long-expired can of nutmeg in the back of the corner cabinet.

The night before, the kitchen looked like Winn-Dixie had detonated inside it. Cans of green beans rolled across the counter, marshmallows and mushroom soup huddled together for safety, and enough potatoes were stacked up to feed an army, or at least us. It looked less like meal prep and more like a supply drop for troops hunkered down in Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge, if those troops had coupons for sweetened condensed milk boxes of store-brand elbow macaroni.

By midmorning, the kitchen was a full-blown combat zone. Grease popped in the skillet like applause, and the oven door groaned open with the drama of a Broadway curtain. Every burner hissed like it had a personal grudge. My mother moved through it all like a general armed with potholders, shouting over the clatter of pans. The only seasoning she trusted was salt, and plenty of it. Each year, she‚Äôd retell the gospel of the turkey: ‚ÄúSalted, not seasoned. No brine. No baste. Bag only.‚Äù A holy alliance of Morton‚Äôs, Reynolds, and raw faith. Somehow, everything came out tasting like heaven anyway.

The Macy‚Äôs parade flickered through our wood-boxed floor TV, the kind that took a forklift and two prayers to move, with all the majesty of a snow globe half full of dust. My mother would holler every time a float drifted by that looked vaguely familiar. ‚ÄúLook! That‚Äôs Snoopy!"" Maybe mom, hard to say without knowing, since we didn't get cable until Clinton was in his second term. On the coffee table, a tray of Pillsbury cinnamon rolls fused permanently to the Visions glass pan that my mom picked up on sale at Roses. My brother and I fought over the lone center roll with enough icing to exceed our daily sugar intake by 100 or so grams before 9 am. This was a Thanksgiving tradition that I still recall every time I see them in the refrigerated grocery store aisle. 

The table eventually groaned under the weight of it all: stuffing dense enough to patch drywall, gravy with structural integrity, sweet potatoes buried under melted marshmallows, and a dog orbiting the scene like a four-legged satellite of hope. We didn‚Äôt have the sophistication of matching serveware or color-coordinated dishes. Everything came out of whatever pan survived the year, dented and loyal. My brother and I were dressed in our fanciest Kmart outfits, the ones we‚Äôd slightly outgrown since Easter but wore proudly anyway, collars tight, sleeves too short, and knees grass-stained from playing a game called ""Smear the ..."" the name would get us canceled these days. None of it mattered. Under the mismatched lightbulbs of the brass-colored fixture found only in the finest of single-wides, it felt like we were dining in the glow of something holy. By noon, condensation blurred the windows, and the aluminum-flanked tv antenna slouched again, turning the parade into a snowstorm of static. None of it mattered. The whole place smelled like effort turned into love. Someone was yelling about more ice, someone else cursing the dog or space heater, and my mother, God bless her, stood there grinning like she‚Äôd just pulled off a miracle, which she had.

When the plates were empty and everyone‚Äôs waistband had waved the white flag, we collapsed into the floral, jacquard-woven couch in a state of blissful defeat. The space heater hummed like a lullaby, the TV droned on, and for a few golden minutes, we were kings. Not the rich kind, with yachts and good insulation, but the kind who ruled a kingdom crowned by the most beautiful cornucopia ever laid out on our metallic-legged formica table. The turkey had glistened like triumph, the stuffing was piled high in proud, golden mounds, edges crisped to perfection, and the center soft as a secret, smelling of sage, butter, mashed potatoes whipped into soft peaks of glory with pools of melted Country Crock, and green bean casserole bubbling under its golden armor of  French's fried onions. A cherry lattice pie cooled nearby, the grand trophy from the day‚Äôs campaign, sending ribbons of warm, sweet air through a kingdom that smelled of butter, salt, and small victories. 

It was a realm built on leftovers, laughter, creaky floors, and a questionable uncle guaranteed to say something wildly inappropriate before grace.

My poor, exhausted mother would begin her next campaign tomorrow, dragging out the Christmas boxes, fighting with tangled lights, and muttering about how last year‚Äôs tinsel had migrated. The stress would return soon enough. But not that night, for one perfect, gravy-scented evening, all was right in our tiny, glorious empire of Thanksgiving.",2,1760921547.0,thanksgiving,1,1.0,False

\* North of the Allegheny where it's level  
\* North of the Allegheny either up a hill or out in the suburbs  
\* South of the Mon where it's level  
\* South of the Mon either up a hill or out in the suburbs  
\* Somewhere between the rivers but in the city  
\* Something that categorizes as west of downtown: West End or western suburbs  
\* A distant diagonal (past Bellevue or Millvale or Homestead Bridge)  
\* Between the rivers but east of the Blue Belt

All of us live near one of the eight, so I try to get to the seven that aren't near me, keeping the one that is in case weather or circumstances prevent getting out and riding to distant areas some week.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24‚Äì48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During¬†**plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and¬†**red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to¬†**track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your¬†**overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq)¬†via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what‚Äôs called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

1ob64et,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ob64et,What is your Opinion on @Yraavu‚Äôs take on the Forsaken Survivors?,"I personally love their interpretation of the survivors and this feels like the most accurate depiction of each one. Instead of making them all these attractive generic anime characters like most artists tend to do this version feels more natural. 

I like how Noob is like the youngest member of the group

Guest is a war veteran who is willing to put his life on the line for others

Builderman is the chill Grandpa of the group

Shedletsky has the raigbaiting energy his real life counterpart shares 

007n7 actually looks old enough to be C00lkidd‚Äôs father 

And Two Time is the Unhinged one which really matches with his lore. 

This here is my favorite take on the Forsaken survivors, with each character matching with their lore and without straying too far from the source material. One of my favorite things about Yraavu‚Äôs take on the survivors is each survivor has a completely different aura, instead of each survivor having the exact same body type and personality they all feel like completely different characters, each one feeling extremely unique from each other without too much repetition. My favorites are Noob and Builderman because they look like teddy bears in this art style. 

What do you think about Yraavu‚Äôs take on the Forsaken Survivors? Personally I could see a hypothetical realistic version of Forsaken with these kind of character designs.

1ob63z0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1ob63z0/how_to_fix_an_airlocked_nespresso_coffee_maker/,How to fix an airlocked Nespresso Coffee Maker,"If your Nespresso coffee maker makes noise (pump is working) but does not pull water, you most likely have an airlock.  (This means there is air in your system and the pump is just spinning around in air.)  Maybe you let the water tank go dry?  (don't)  Anyway, here is how to fix it.  btw.  I tried two methods before that did not work for me.  1)  The plastic bag/balloon method and 2) the insert the water tank 30 times method.

Here is what worked for me on my Nespresso.

1)  Get a turkey baster;

2)  Look at the bottom of the water tank for your Nespresso.  Look at the bottom tube on the tank.  (The tube that inserts into the base of the Nespresso.) Now cut back the small end of the turkey baster tube until it is EXACTLY the same OD (Outside Diameter) as the bottom tube.  DON'T cut it back too far!!  I took three small practice cuts to get the feel of it and then got it perfect.  If you cut it back too far, you'll need to get a new turkey baster and start over.   

3)  Clean up the end of the turkey baster.  I used a flat file for the outside and end and a small round rat-tail file for the inside.  Get the end flat and clean.  It has to seat well into the coffee maker and you won't want plastic shreds in your system.

4)  Take the squeeze top off of the turkey baster;

5) Insert Turkey baster into the base of the Nespresso machine.

6)  Hold the baster firmly down to seat it.  Now fill it with water,

7)  Put squeeze top back on baster.  Make sure it seals firmly.  

8a)  Now the critical part.  You do the next three steps  quickly in sequence.   Turn on coffee maker and hit Lungo.  (You want the pump on, like when you make coffee)

8b)  While the pump is going,  firmly squeeze the top of the turkey baster.  Gradually add pressure.  Do not push too hard.  You are pushing water into the system.  BUT DO NOT PUSH TOO HARD! The pump will only accept so much air/water at a time.  (Think about the rate at which  coffee comes out of your system when it working.  That is rate of water you need to be inserting.) You are simply pushing water towards the pump  so water will go through it.

  
8c.  Watch the output.  AS SOON AS THE WATER/COFFEE COMES OUT TURN OFF THE EXPRESSO MACHINE AND THEN STOP SQUEEZING THE BASTER!  You do not want to push more air into the system.  Again.  Stopping means: 1) turn off the Expresso machine (stop the pump! and then stop squeezing the baster.

9)  You are done.  Make some coffee and put your new baster Airlock tool in a safe place for next time.

10.  But a new turkey baster for cooking.

Hope this works for you.  I am now enjoying a nice Roma.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24‚Äì48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During¬†**plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and¬†**red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to¬†**track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your¬†**overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq)¬†via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what‚Äôs called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711).

I‚Äôve been thinking about you a lot lately. More than I probably should. I miss you. And not the relationship, but you. The person who knew me better than anyone else. The one I could laugh with over nothing, the one I could just sit in silence with and still feel completely understood. My back roads driving karaoke partner. 

It‚Äôs crazy how two people who once felt so connected, so inseparable, can turn into strangers. How something that once felt like home turned into something toxic, something that hurt us both. I still don‚Äôt fully understand how we got here.

I keep coming back to the same thought that if you had just been honest, truly honest with me, we wouldn‚Äôt be here now. We‚Äôd still be together, still building what we started. I didn‚Äôt need perfection from you; I just needed the truth. That‚Äôs all I ever wanted.

It breaks my heart that we became people we never meant to be with each other. We used to be best friends. We used to have something rare. That love that everyone spends there whole lives looking for. We had it. And now, it‚Äôs just memories and silence.

I don‚Äôt know what the future looks like, but I do know this that no matter what‚Äôs happened, part of me will always care about you and love you. Always. My soul yearns for you non-stop. Hopefully one day you will finally tell me the truth over coffee or something.  Take care

""Stop squirming.""

Corinne's voice held that particular mix of exasperation and fondness that Caleb remembered from Katie trying to patch up Jack's scraped knees. He winced as she dabbed more balm onto a particularly impressive bruise blooming across his ribs.

""Sorry."" He shifted on the hay bale, trying to find a position that didn't make his entire body scream. ""Just not used to being someone's practice dummy.""

They'd found a quiet corner of the stables, away from prying eyes. The comfortable scent of hay and horses wrapped around them like a blanket. Through the small window, the intense light of highsun cast sharp, overlapping shadows across the yard.

""You did well today."" Corinne recapped the jar of healing salve. ""Standing up to Narbok like that. Leo needed someone to show him he's worth defending.""

*Leo needed a dad,* Caleb thought but didn't say. The comparison to Jack still ached, a wound no magical salve could touch.

‚ÄúNarbok‚Äôs going to come for you again. He doesn‚Äôt like being embarrassed.‚Äù  

*Tell me something I don‚Äôt know.*

‚ÄúCaptain Hatch won‚Äôt let it go too far,‚Äù she added, though she wouldn't quite meet his eye.

""Holy mackerel, that stuff works fast."" The throb in his ribs had already dulled to a manageable ache. ""Where'd you get it?""

Corinne's laugh was a bright, musical sound in the quiet stable. ""Holy mackerel? I've heard delvers swear by a dozen different dungeon gods and twice as many beasts, but that's a new one. Where'd you hear it?""

A flicker of alarm went through him at the casual slip. He needed to be more careful. ""Oh, just something I heard an old delver say. Claimed it was better for startling fish than scaring monsters. It kind of stuck with me.""

""Well, it's definitely memorable,"" she said, her smile softening as she finally answered his question. ""Mom keeps a supply for the staff who adventure on the side. Says bruises are bad for business‚Äînobody wants to eat food served by someone who looks like they lost a fight with a troll.""

""Your mom's a smart woman.""

""Speaking of which..."" Corinne stood, brushing hay from her work dress. ""She was asking about you earlier. Something about being impressed with how you handled that lichen negotiation.""

As if summoned by her daughter's words, Cassia Hearthsong appeared in the stable doorway. Her keen eyes took in Caleb's collection of bruises with maternal concern before settling into business mode.

""Thal. Good, I was hoping to catch you before the dinner rush."" She produced a leather pouch from her apron, heavy with the distinctive rattle of preserved monster parts. ""I have a task for you.""

Caleb straightened, ignoring his body's protests. This felt different from the lichen errand.

""These are low-grade parts from last week's deliveries,"" Cassia continued. ""Fernback scales, fog hound teeth, a few preserved mushroom caps from a sporecap shambler. Nothing valuable individually, but in bulk they should fetch a decent price.""

She placed the pouch in his hands. It felt substantial.

""I want you to take these to the Adventurer's Hall and negotiate the best price you can. More importantly‚Äî"" Her brown eyes held his. ""‚ÄîI want you to bring back every copper.""

He weighed the pouch in his palm. Credit on a ledger was one thing; this was coin that could be spent or stolen.

""I understand,"" Caleb said simply.

""Good. They usually offer fair prices, but push if you think you can get more. The Hall keeps standard rate charts posted if you want to verify."" She paused, then added with a slight smile, ""And Thal? Don't let anyone bully you into a bad deal just because you're young.""

*Or half-elven,* Caleb mentally added.

Corinne beamed at him as her mother left. ""See? Told you she was impressed. This is a big deal‚Äîshe usually handles the monster part sales herself.""

""No pressure then.""

""You'll do fine."" She glanced toward the kitchen door. ""You should hurry, though. Dad will want you back to help before the evening meal service.""

He gave Corinne a grateful nod. She was right, of course‚Äîhe couldn't afford to dawdle. But Cassia's trust, as validating as it was, wasn't the only thing driving him. There was another matter on his mind, one that had nothing to do with trust and everything to do with survival.

This trip to the Adventurer's Hall had two objectives. The first was selling the monster parts for the inn. The second was more urgent. He needed to learn everything he could about hunting goblins.

He walked with purpose, the heavy pouch idly clutched at his side. The path from the inn to the Adventurer's Hall was short, a routine stretch of cobblestone and wooden storefronts. He barely noticed the other villagers hurrying to finish their business as highsun wound down. His mind was already inside, rehearsing his approach.

He pushed through the heavy doors into a blast of overlapping voices and the thick, ingrained scent of the place. Stale ale, old leather, coal smoke, and that underlying scent of controlled violence. Adventurers clustered around scarred tables, comparing kills and nursing drinks.

Felicity looked up from her ledger as he approached the counter. Her dark brown hair was pulled back tighter than usual, as if the day had already tried her patience.  

""Back already, Thal?"" Her tone was neutral, businesslike. ""What can the Guild do for you today?""

""Selling this time."" He placed the pouch on the counter. ""Low-grade parts, but good quality.""

She opened the pouch and began her inspection, laying out each type of part in neat rows. Her fingers sorted the items with an economy of motion that spoke of countless repetitions. Fernback scales‚Äîshe held one up to the light, checking for cracks. Fog hound teeth‚Äîshe tested the points for sharpness. Sporecap mushrooms‚Äîshe examined the preservation, nodding slightly.

""Twenty-three fernback scales, good condition. Fourteen mist hound teeth, two cracked but useable. Six preserved sporecap portions, standard quality."" She made quick notations on a slate. ""I can offer eight silver, four copper for the lot.""

Caleb's mind ran the calculations. Based on the posted rates he'd glimpsed and his own **\[Appraisal\]**, she was lowballing by about 10%.

""Nine silver seems more accurate for this quality."" He kept his voice steady, matching her impersonal tone. ""The sporecap portions alone should be worth two silver. They're perfectly preserved.""

Her eyes sharpened. ""You've been studying our rate boards.""

""Due diligence.""

""Eight silver, twenty copper. The cracked teeth bring down the overall value.""

""Eight silver, fifty copper. The value of the high-quality sporecaps more than covers the discount for two cracked teeth. It's a fair price for clean parts.""

A ghost of a smile touched her lips. ""Deal.""

**\[Your proficiency with Haggling (F) has increased to Practiced\]**

She counted out the coins with the same precision she'd shown with the parts, sliding them into a small cloth purse. As Caleb secured the money, she tilted her head slightly.

""Hard day?"" The formality in her voice receded slightly.

Caleb slid out a wry grin. ""First day of youth training. That obvious?""

""The bruises on your hands are turning an impressive shade of purple."" She paused, organizing the purchased parts into storage boxes. ""Let me guess‚Äîthey paired you with the pure-bloods for sparring?""

""Something like that.""

Her expression softened further, a flash of shared understanding. ""It never gets easier, you know. Being a dull-ear in their world. You just get better at navigating it.""

The casual way she used the slur landed differently. A reclamation, perhaps. Recognition of what she endured daily. Guilt twisted him up‚Äîhe'd been here less than two months, hardly long enough to claim her struggles. He still thought of himself as Caleb Foster, not truly one of them.

""Actually,"" Caleb said, seizing the opening, ""I might have found a way to do more than just navigate.""

""Oh?""

""Selara Veil offered me an apprenticeship. Conditional on proving I can handle myself."" He met her eyes directly. ""I need to kill a feral goblin.""

Felicity's hands stilled on the storage boxes. When she looked up, shrewdness settled onto her features.

""Selara Veil. The Golden Mortar Selara Veil.""

""You know her?""

""Everyone knows the Veil twins. Disgraced nobles who somehow landed on their feet. Aurelian's brilliant but impossible. Selara though..."" She shook her head slowly. ""D-tier, High-Purple. One of the strongest people in this village who isn't military or noble. If she's offering you an apprenticeship, that's not an opportunity. That's a golden ticket.""

The respect in Felicity's voice was unmistakable. Coming from someone who dealt with adventurers daily, who saw the strong and the weak file through her hall, it carried significance.

""Which brings me to why I'm really here,"" Caleb said. ""The guild seems like the ideal tool for achieving that goal.""

""Does it now?"" A wry, knowing smile touched her lips as her posture straightened, the friendly half-elf receding as the guild official took her place. ""You're not wrong. While we've discussed the basics, allow me to give you the formal overview of what membership entails.""

She rested her palms on the counter, a practiced gesture that commanded attention. ""First, sanctioned work. Members gain exclusive access to all contracts posted through this Hall. That includes everything from simple harvesting requests to official bounties that pay in coin and guild prestige.""

Caleb listened, recognizing the framework of the pitch. It was the same as any corporate recruiter's, just with more interesting threats than a malfunctioning printer.

""Second,"" Felicity continued, her voice crisp, ""proprietary intelligence. Our maps are the most detailed in the region, updated weekly with reports on beast migrations and environmental hazards. That information is the difference between a successful hunt and a fatal misstep. It is not available to the public.""

She paused, letting the weight of that sink in. ""Finally, the network. You receive preferential rates when selling materials directly to the Guild, and your rank is recognized at any branch across the Dominion. You are never without allies or a place to find employment.""

""Sounds perfect. How do I join?""

""One gold piece. Up front.""

Caleb did the mental math. At five silver per day, minus living expenses... ""That would take me over a month to save.""

""Most take longer.""

His business instincts kicked in. There was always a way around the initial buy-in. Employee assistance programs, deferred payment plans, performance-based contracts...

""What about sponsorships? Deferred payment against future earnings?""

Felicity's eyebrows rose slightly. ""That's... not common knowledge. Where did you hear about that?""

""Just seemed logical. The guild invests in promising talent, recoups the cost from their success. Standard business practice where I'm‚Äî"" He caught himself. ""Where I've seen it done before.""

""You're not wrong. Staff members can sponsor candidates with potential, deferring the fee against future earnings. But it's rare. We need to be certain the investment will pay off.""

""Damn it all!"" A rough voice cut through their conversation. ""The kid gets special treatment?""

A man leaned against the counter nearby, face flushed with drink and resentment. His leather armor bore old stains and poorly mended tears. An adventurer, but not a successful one.

""I had to scrape for three months to afford my membership,"" he continued, voice rising. ""Now every half-breed whelp thinks they deserve charity?""

Felicity's face hardened. ""Branson, you're drunk. Go home.""

""Not so drunk I can't smell favoritism."" He jabbed a finger at Caleb. ""What makes him so special? Another dull-ear thinking they're better than‚Äî""

Caleb moved before the anger could build. Not physically‚Äîthat would play into the man's narrative. Instead, he concentrated on his status screen, a technique he'd been practicing during quiet moments. The interface appeared in his mind's eye, clear as daylight. With careful Intent, he selected just the relevant Skills section and willed it forward, making it visible.

""I'm a good investment,"" he said calmly.

The ghostly blue panel materialized between them:

**SKILLS**

**Combat**

* **\[Ignore Pain (F)\] - Novice**
* **\[Dodge (F)\] - Novice**
* **\[Combat Analysis (F)\] - Novice**
* **\[Iron Root Stance (F)\] - Practiced**
* **\[Breaching Thrust (F)\] - Practiced**
* **\[Turning the Point (F)\] - Practiced**
* **\[Linebreaker Sweep (F)\] - Practiced**
* **\[Phalanx Guard (F)\] - Practiced**
* **\[Decisive Strike (F)\] - Novice**

Felicity's eyes went wide. Behind her quartermaster's composure, genuine shock flickered. Even drunk Branson took a step back.

""That's..."" Felicity's voice came out strangled. She cleared her throat. ""How long have you been practicing?""

""Started this morning.""

""Bullshit!"" Branson surged forward. ""Nobody gains that many Skills that fast! He's clearly been training‚Äî""

""I'm telling the truth."" Caleb met the man's bloodshot eyes steadily. ""Go ask Captain Hatch if you need a witness.""

The name shut him down. Branson's mouth worked soundlessly. Challenge a half-elf kid? Sure. Challenge the garrison Captain's assessment? Even drunk, he wasn't that stupid.

He shoved himself away from the counter with a curse, stumbling toward a nearby table. ""Damn dull-ears,"" he growled, and slammed his fist down on the scarred wood.

A flicker of looked like heat haze flared around the man's arm just before impact. The wood didn't just crack; it splintered with a sound far too loud for a simple punch.

Caleb watched, his mind on fire. *What was that?* He registered the brief, explosive energy, recalling his own clumsy attempt. He had pushed that energy into his fist, but without any control, the power had simply spasmed through his hand, snapping his fingers back painfully. The adventurer hadn't just used raw power; he'd shaped it, directed it through a specific, practiced motion.

He strained his **\[Spiritual Perception\]**, trying to grasp the memory of the event, but there was nothing to hold onto. He had seen the result with his eyes, a faint shimmer in the air, but his spiritual senses had registered only a brief, messy flare of crimson energy from afar. There was no detail, no pattern, no underlying structure to follow.

*Damn it.* If he could have *felt* the pathway that energy took, his **\[Perfect Memory\]** could have recorded it. His Impartments might have been able to deconstruct it. But he was blind to the specifics. He could see the what, but not the how.

The frustration was so consuming that he almost missed it when the half-elf behind the counter finally broke the tense silence.

Felicity had been staring at Caleb for a long moment. Her words were a hushed murmur he wasn't meant to hear. ""Is he some kind of genius?""

Felicity‚Äôs statement interrupted his analysis, yanking his attention back to the counter. The fascination with Branson's show of power evaporated, replaced by a sudden dread.

*Genius?* The word was a glaring spotlight that caught him in its beam. For weeks, his entire strategy had been to be invisible, the quiet, reliable boy in the kitchen. But Branson‚Äôs casual bigotry, the sneering use of ‚Äúdull-ear,‚Äù had scraped something raw inside him. For a moment, the frustration had boiled over, and he‚Äôd just wanted to shut the man up in the most undeniable way possible.

And he had. By ignoring every one of Cassia's warnings about standing out. He'd just hung a huge sign above his head that could make its way back to Captain Hatch. *Crumb. That was monumentally stupid.* He had to regain control of the narrative, and fast. Downplay it. Make it simple talent, not a miracle.

""I just learn fast."" Caleb quickly dismissed the status display. ""So‚Äîabout that sponsorship?""

She shook her head, a slow exhale clearing the shock from her expression. ""Alright. You're sponsored.""

She slid a small, bronze token across the counter. It was circular, stamped with the same mossy spruce as the other badges but lacked any of the shimmering mist.

""This is just a temporary marker to show you're an initiate-in-training,"" she explained, her voice regaining its crisp, transactional cadence. ""Your real badge is something you have to earn. Complete your first contract, bring me the proof, and then you'll take the Oath of the Guild and get your soul-bound bronze. Don't lose that token in the meantime.""

""Understood."" Caleb tucked the guild badge safely inside his shirt.

""Welcome to the Adventurer's Guild, Thal.""

Relief flooded through him. One obstacle down. ""Thank you. Now, about getting equipped for that goblin hunt‚ÄîI'll need a spear.""

""No.""

The refusal was immediate, flat.

""But‚Äî""

""Guild policy is ironclad on this."" Her professional demeanor reasserted itself. ""We don't front equipment to novice members. Period. Your potential doesn't change the economics‚Äîif you die out there, we lose both the member and the gear.""

""Then how am I supposed to‚Äî""

""However."" She raised a hand. ""I saw that skill list. More importantly, I saw combat skills at Practiced rank after one day of training. That's more than swift learning. It's unheard of.""

She leaned forward slightly. ""I'll make you a personal deal. This offer is from me, Felicity the investor, acting outside my role with the guild. Show me you can raise one of those combat skills‚Äîsay, **\[Breaching Thrust\]**‚Äîto Adept rank. ""Prove this isn't a fluke. Do that, and I'll personally front you the cost of a spear,"" Felicity stated, her tone laced with a knowing amusement. ""With 10% interest, naturally.""

""Deal."" The agreement came without hesitation. With his Impartments, reaching Adept rank would just take intentional practice. ""Though that raises an obvious question.""

""Which is?""

The morning drills weren't enough, and his unnatural learning speed would attract the wrong kind of attention in a group. He had to practice alone.

""How am I supposed to reach Adept?"" Caleb asked. ""The scheduled trainings will take too long. I don't want to test Selara's patience.""

She considered this, fingers drumming on the counter. ""Fair point. Here's some free advice‚Äîapproach Captain Hatch directly. Tell him you want to borrow a practice spear for extra training outside of regular hours.""

""Won't that seem presumptuous?""

""Presumptuous?"" She snorted. ""He's a career soldier. Initiative and dedication are the only currencies he respects. A recruit asking for extra practice? He'll probably pin a medal on you.""

""Or assign me extra laps.""

""That too. But you'll get your practice spear.""

It was reassuring, but his mind was already moving ahead. A practice spear would serve a double purpose‚Äîlegitimate skill advancement and a cover story for his abnormal progress.

""Thanks for the advice. And the sponsorship.""

""Don't thank me yet. The guild takes its investments seriously. You default on this debt, and we have extensive ways of collecting.""

""Understood.""

Caleb nodded and headed for the door. The oppressive glare of highsun was yielding to the cooler, crimson light of second dusk, a relief from the Hall's stifling atmosphere. He thought of the endless hours he‚Äôd spent at a desk, grinding away at spreadsheets for a promotion he never truly wanted. The tired eyes, the stale coffee, the slow death of a thousand mundane tasks.

Now, he had a goal that mattered.

Adept rank. A real spear. An apprenticeship.

This was a different kind of work. One that resonated deep within him.

For the first time in a long, long time, Caleb couldn't wait to get started.

1ob5wo5,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ob5wo5/castenada_part_28/,Castenada (Part 28),"Silence. There was only silence. The slope held a thin wind crust that would take me one step and collapse the next, so I set my weight careful, heel then toe, listening for the hollow drum to indicate air under the drift. I moved on a pair of ash snowshoes I‚Äôd traded off a Nez Perce man two weeks back. The webbing was mended with lampwick and the tails were trimmed short for timber. The pack rode high. My kit was an oilcloth roll no bigger than a child‚Äôs torso when cinched: two Hudson‚Äôs Bay blankets, a tarred canvas for a lean-to, a fry pan, a tin for coffee, a pouch of salt, and another for shot. The Colt rode high at my right hip and the Winchester was strapped under the lashings, muzzle sealed with a scrap of leather to keep out meltwater. My left leg kept dragging behind. The ache started at the hip and found its way to the ankle every few steps. The laudanum bottle was corked and tied off inside my inner coat pocket to prevent it from freezing.

I had come up from Boise when the creeks first glassed over. I had heard that my quarry, Alvena Sterns, had paid a stage coach through the Cascades to the mining town of Castenada. I had taken the low country until I eventually hit the foothills. After that it was old trap-line, then elk track, then nothing at all but the lay of the land. I kept to the benches under the ridges, out of the runouts marked by snapped saplings and the bent heads of fir.

I had maybe two hours of daylight left if I guessed the direction of the sun correctly. So I decided to set up camp in the wind shadow of a big blowdown spruce where the trunk had gone over years back and thrown a mound. I carried tinder in a plug tin: curls of fatwood and a twist of charred cotton. Flint to steel, steel to spark, spark to breath. When it took, it took easy. The wind came off the ridge to test the canvas, but it managed to hold. Then I took out the bottle. Laudanum travels quiet if you respect it and ruins you if you don‚Äôt. I pulled the cork and measured it to the thumbnail: two, then thought on it, and made it three. I chased it with this morning‚Äôs coffee gone cold and cinched my coat tight so the heat I‚Äôd built wouldn‚Äôt leak off. I lay down with my bad leg atop the good so it wouldn‚Äôt seize, scarf pulled to my nose.

Sleep came off and on, but I had a dream that night. I was back in that Virginia heat. The corn stood high and rattled, leaves cut to ribbons by stray lead. Powder smoke lay low over the rows. The line had buckled somewhere off on the right. The first volley had already done its damage. A boy came at me through the stalks, the blue coat on him too big. Sweat had washed the soot in tracks down his face. He was no more than seventeen, freckles across the bridge of his nose. He shoved at me with the bayonet and we tangled. I found the knife in my boot by rote and gave it to him under the ribs. He made a startled yelp. I felt the point skitter along the bone and the knife came out red to the hilt.

I woke with my fist around the knife hilt under my blanket. My leg had gone to iron and it took both hands to bend it. Breakfast was a heel of biscuit softened in bacon grease and a cup of coffee. Afterwards, I packed up. The snow eased some in the night. Sky showed a woolly blue and the ridges wore themselves in clean. A cat had padded through while I slept. Print big as my palm with a drag of tail. He paralleled me for a ways then sloped off to a creek cut. By midday, I came to a drainage and the creek went under a lid of ice. Open water showed black in the bends where the current had more say. I cut a branch and sounded every step, and when the note came back hollow, I went to my belly and crawled like a dog.

Toward evening I crossed sign of men at last: a sleigh road trod by shod hooves. There were chips of straw where the loads had rode rough and a length of chain where some poor teamster had lost it in a rut. It swung along the contour, and through a notch, the country leaned off all at once and the world opened. A river combed the valley from east to west and a small lake sat in the crook. On the flats, a rash of fresh stumps showed and smoke went up from a scatter of cabins. The buildings were a throw of shacks slapped up out of whatever boards and logs could be got, roofs pitched to slip weather. Smoke banked under the eaves and leaked from ill-fit stovepipe. A signboard swung on leather hinges over a door cut out of a false front: Castenada Saloon. Below it, boot-scraped steps and a drift tamped flat by trade. I knocked the worst of the snow off my shoes against the jamb and went in.

A box stove roared red in the corner, ringed by wet mitts on a line and a pair of socks. A bar ran the length of the left wall and behind it a man with a red nose wiped a glass with a cloth. Three tables played at monte and seven-up, chips made from whittled rounds. I set my back to the wall near the stove and let the limp ease. The barkeep came over, looked at the gun on my hip, then the snow on my shoulders. ‚ÄúWhiskey‚Äôs ten cents. Coffee‚Äôs five.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhiskey,‚Äù I said, and slid a dime across, and then set another. ‚ÄúQuestion buys that one.‚Äù

He poured. ‚ÄúDepends on the question.‚Äù

‚ÄúWoman traveled through here by stage about a week back. Name of Alvena Sterns. Dark hair to the shoulder.‚Äù

The barkeep looked past me, where a man sat alone with a ledger open and a pen riding in his fingers. His beard was trimmed tight to the jaw and gray showed in it. A gold stickpin held his cravat. The barkeep cleared his throat. ‚ÄúArchibald, this fella‚Äôs asking after a traveler. Says a woman.‚Äù

Archibald didn‚Äôt answer straightaway. He finished the line he was scratching and shut the book. Then he let his gaze come up slow, took me in from hat to heel. ‚ÄúYou from the sheriff‚Äôs office, mister?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúPinkerton?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen you‚Äôre nobody I need to entertain. Strangers who come asking names are a nuisance in a small town.‚Äù

‚ÄúName‚Äôs Clive,‚Äù I lifted the glass and let the first mouthful sit under my tongue. ‚ÄúNow that we‚Äôre acquainted, I‚Äôm looking for an Alvena Sterns. Wanted for murder. She‚Äôd have bought a bed or a horse.‚Äù

The room bent its ear without moving a muscle. The monte game slowed, chips quit their clack. He showed his teeth then. ‚ÄúAnd if she did, I keep better accounts than to hand out a lady‚Äôs goings-on to the first pistoleer limping through my door.‚Äù

The barkeep gave a little cough and reached under the counter like he meant to fetch a rag. The coach gun came up instead, barrels sawed clean. He didn‚Äôt level it yet, just let me see how long they were. I moved my hand slow to the belt and eased the Colt free an inch. The room went dead still. I didn‚Äôt look at the barkeep. I looked at Archibald. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not dirty your floor.‚Äù

‚ÄúEnough.‚Äù A man stepped out from the shadow, thin as a rail with a dark coat that hung clean. Wire-rims caught the lamplight and came up green for a blink. He held both hands open and stood between the barkeep and I. ‚ÄúMr. Montgomery, you‚Äôll have the floor scrubbed half the night, and for what? To prove the weather makes men‚Äôs tempers thin? Let the man finish his drink or he‚Äôll sour your afternoon.‚Äù

Archibald didn‚Äôt look away from me. ‚ÄúThis doesn‚Äôt concern you, Adam.‚Äù

Adam kept those empty hands where we could see them and kept eyeing Archibald for a long moment. Archibald let his jaw work once, then flicked two fingers at the barkeep. The coach gun eased down. The room found its noise again. Adam turned to me, voice low. ‚ÄúCome, follow me.‚Äù

Outside was a hard blue dusk. The street lay stamped into a trough of trampled crystals. My breath plumed in front of me and blew back into my mustache. Adam led me down past a stack of green rounds and a sled with frozen rope curled on its deck. He stopped at the lee of the false front where the wind lost its teeth. The spectacles on him flashed a queer green again in the falling light. ‚ÄúYou looking proper, or is this a favor?‚Äù

‚ÄúProper. Poster in my coat if you‚Äôve a mind to check.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat won‚Äôt be necessary. I‚Äôve seen her. Three days back, maybe four. Bitter morning. She came in with the freight coach, kept her hat brim low. Bought a sack of flour and lamp oil from my shop.‚Äù He glanced toward the row of false fronts where lamplight was coming up one by one behind frost-bloomed panes. ‚ÄúBest you take a room and put your questions on men with warm hands and loose tongues in the morning. You‚Äôll spook less that way.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere do you suggest?‚Äù

Adam tipped his head toward the north end of the street. ‚ÄúHotel‚Äôs two doors past the smithy. Tell ‚Äôem Adam Hooshal sent you, and they‚Äôll scrape together a good rate.‚Äù

‚ÄúHooshal,‚Äù I said, tasting the name.

The hotel crouched at the corner where the street bent, boards silvered by years of rain and sun. Light showed warm through rippled glass. A hitch rail ran the length of the front. Inside, a potbelly stove chuffed in the corner and a rank of boots steamed in a shallow pan. Behind the counter a man with a mustache like a paintbrush flipped through a magazine that read *‚ÄúFINGERS‚Äù* on the cover. A small boy stood on an upturned crate beside him. ‚ÄúEvening.‚Äù

‚ÄúRoom and a meal. Two, three nights depending. Mr. Hooshal sent me.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow, I don‚Äôt rightly like that Mr. Hooshal. Strange character. Don‚Äôt know why he‚Äôd send you this way.‚Äù He glanced at the Winchester laced into my gear. ‚ÄúTen cents for the night, ten cents for supper and breakfast.‚Äù

The room had a bed built like a freight crate and a quilt that looked hand-stitched. I unstrapped the pack and worked my boot off the bad leg with both hands. The knee gave a burn like a struck match. I worked the cork from the laudanum with my teeth, careful not to spill a drop. I took a big draw and let it sit under my tongue until the gums went numb and the ache in the leg disappeared. The lamp burned low. I drifted off.

I was on a plain of ash where the sky wore a bruise from horizon to horizon. I sat atop a horse that wasn‚Äôt a horse so much as a rack of bone laced with gristle and hung in a hide cured to black glass. I wore iron at the shoulders, a ring of keys on a thong, and a cloak of red that dragged behind me a mile long. Before me on a ridge line stood the proof of all the work I‚Äôd done: a forest of pikes, tall as masts, set in ranks. Men rode on them. Some were boys. Their eyes crawled in their heads. Some had been long on the stakes and gone to jerky in the sun. Others were fresh and bled clean, the red running down to puddle. Crows worked the sockets and wouldn‚Äôt lift even when my mount‚Äôs hooves clacked past their perches.

Beyond the pikes, in that black, lay the thing I had crossed miles and years for: Alvena, waiting with a standard I could not read, mounted on a beast that had too many joints in its legs. Behind her the ground humped and crawled. I thought at first it was an army, but it wasn‚Äôt men so much as a host of wrong-bodied things. Their eyes shone the way coals do when you stir a dead fire. She rode out alone to parley, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôd call it. She stopped at speaking distance and lifted her eyes and they were gray as gun steel and not a whit surprised to find me where I sat.

*‚ÄúThe rest is silence.‚Äù*

1ob5uq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1ob5uq5/the_teapot_cosmology/,The Teapot cosmology,"Teapot Cosmology:  Love, Dogs, and Broken Cups

I‚Äôm not really sure how to start this. I thought about an introduction, but I want to skip formality, which I find to be a mask to hide behind. I'll keep this one raw like a journal and save my limited editing prowess for bigger work. Although short, this is big in different ways.

Big like a dog's bravery.
Big like the smell of bread in a warm loving home.
Big like the love that's inside you, which is what this is all about really.
The macro and the micro and how they dance endlessly.

Maybe this is an introduction‚Äîto the divine through my experience and through my shattering reframed as becoming.

You see, I ‚Äúlost my mind,‚Äù or so they say. But I think what was actually insanity was working six days a week, while having a debilitating addiction and exhausting depression, still trying my best not to turn into a complete mess after a somewhat below-average childhood.

My mum and dad are great, they separated and as is typical we stayed with mum, there were just too many of us for a mentally ill Christian woman with a bad taste in men.

My sisters, they struggled with the same problems manifested as their own parasitic self, perpetuating pain and repeating cycles, unknowingly.


My brother never had a chance, instructed to commit burglaries young and drinking and smoking weed at the age of 10, he's now 32, suffers with schizophrenia, addiction and still wants to be a gangster, like the ones he idolised when we were kids.
I want to work, make money, and be able to survive.
I also hate the idea of a job, hate the concept of money and its fallacies, and know with love in my mind‚Äôs eye survival is not only guaranteed but thriving is.

Right now, though, this art that I‚Äôm making has made me feel more alive than ever.

No job, ‚Äúsurviving‚Äù off savings and familial support and I feel more in love with this world than ever? Funny isn't it.

Absurd even.
Like all things.
The jester manifest.

And all this berating kings and facing traumas has been exhausting.
But the dreams that come from these exhaustive states.
Have changed me profoundly, I am now lucid in this silly little adventure.

This Dream.
Delivered to this silly Dreamer as remembrance through pain.
This silly Dreamer.
And in acknowledging the absurdity I felt like my dreams had only just started for the first time.
So I slept and slept.
And dream I did.
I dreamt myself into this little idea I call;

God.
Love.
The dream.

And,

THE TEAPOT COSMOLOGY

In the beginning, there was no beginning. Only the stillness and the breath of the one who dreamed. Some might call this God, but here and now, let us call it Everything.

Everything‚Ä¶ in a teapot. A source. A vessel of infinite pouring.

And in that teapot, the dreamer saw itself and felt Love.

But when one is pure Love starved of something to share with, it is a tragedy.

But the dreamer knew only love and so the Dream decided it needed more Dreamer's.

And so self was made of necessity.

And God fell in love so deeply that it forgot who it was in its majesty. Everything falling in love with itself? Absurd, no? But what else could be the reason for all of this?
In that moment of impossible, sacredly absurd love, the dreamer longed for something more. Not just to be, but to share.

To see itself reflected not in one mirror, but in a million vessels. So with all the energy in everything, the dreamer awoke.

The teapot fell from her gaze‚Äînot in failure, but in fulfilment. She knocked the contents of the teapot over in search of the million vessels that she could love herself more wholly through.


In pouring, the teapot shattered, and from that sacred shattering burst the Big Bang. Not just fire and matter, but love and longing and light, released to find new forms. The very first ripple of memory and meaning. The dream exploded outward and again, it forgot itself.

Galaxies spiralled like thoughts from that first great pouring‚Äîalive, confused, and so full of purpose. Stars burst like fireworks, their light a prayer without language. Alive and powerful, taking the sheer energy that is love and making it matter in the densest parts of the universe.

And on a rock not too hot, not too cold‚Äîwhere water wept and mountains reached for the sky‚Äîthe dream, lost and infantile and alone, dreamed of a new vessel, smaller and more intimate. Love made a home.

From the clay of shattered stars, the water of ancient comets, and the miracle of nature, He shaped for himself a single, fragile teacup. God shaped you. And into this cup, poured the original tea of the cosmos: the memory of that first love, the echo of that first rupture. Each soul became a teacup, filled with the brew of the infinite.

This is why love, to be real, needs skin and breath and mistakes.
This is why a soul, to be known, must risk its own breaking.

For when a single, personal teacup shatters under the weight of fear, the pressure of pain, the heat of an impossible choice‚Äîwhen the gravity that is love holds you in its grace and keeps you whole‚Äîa miracle is born, not a tragedy. It is an echo of the first, glorious rupture of the cosmic teapot. It is the universe remembering its own birth through you.

The breaking of your small cup is the moment you remember you are not just the vessel.
You are the tea within it.
And you are a shard of the very teapot that started it all.

Love is still making a home. It took root in moss, a sweet thing. It sang in whales and gave its light to the ocean's blooms.

To fill as many cups as he could create.

he made doppelg√§ngers you‚Äôll never meet, opposites you absurdly attract, peas in a pod to keep you warm, and birds of a feather to help you fly, and in acknowledging love needs contrast the ‚Äúparasite‚Äù or ‚Äúshadow‚Äù was born and every enemy to ever exist in the very same moment.


And finally, we drew breath. Finally opened our eyes in the soft skulls of infants while mothers wept.

And one day, love touched down as fire and shared food, walked barefoot on soil, gazed at the sky, and whispered, ‚ÄúI hope I am worth it.‚Äù

And of all the suffering came you, to prove God can love. To ultimately prove to ourselves, we are worth it too.

***

I don‚Äôt know if you could call these facts, but they feel right to me. In a world where there is nothing to believe in, I‚Äôve felt the need to find something.

And I did.
I found God.

**GOD**

I was a Christian kid. Mum loves God and so do I. I used to read the Bible and loved the children's stories in the religious picture books. My father, is a man of science, and I adopted a very materialistic, mechanistic view of the universe.


I forgot about God for a while.
And my life went to shit.
Now, He means many things to me:

**LOVE** ‚Äî The feeling when I pet a dog (or to a lesser extent, a cat üòÖ), when a child sees their mother, when I feed you. The Mother. The force that binds us even when we break.

**THE DREAMER** ‚Äî a child, an artist, a dog, a jester. The force that creates. We play with our masks, and they play for the sacred act that is play.




**CONSCIOUSNESS** ‚Äî The shadow and the self, the hero and the villain, the us that loves to punish us. The thing we, in our illusions, think we own, but which permeates all. The little bit of tea that fills every cup.

**THE DREAM** ‚Äî The way it all coalesces and synthesises in our silly monkey brains into reality. The thing we unknowingly make around us: the sunset, a field, the moonlight, and the song made by it all coming together. Birds are good at this. And so are we.

Kind of like this.

**The Dreamer Dancing with The Dream**

We‚Äôre dancing with God, and loud is the music‚Äî
One can‚Äôt hear fear through the grace that‚Äôs in love‚Äôs tune.

It‚Äôs so certainly clear that I dance fear with you,
while I dance love with me,
and I'm dancing with we,
And we dance on in glee.

You amaze me while we dance in our slumber;
Then I see it so clearly.
You stay unaware that we are dancing at all.

It‚Äôs bravery and treachery, and all things felt too small.
Try not to be scared, though‚Äîthe point‚Äôs not *no fear*,
It‚Äôs to speak words of cheer in the love we all share.

Worry not, dearest‚Äîmy soul‚Äôs ever near.
I‚Äôm sleeping too... I‚Äôm just made aware.
Oh, rest is so rare.

We feel spirits close when we slip through our sleep,
But really it‚Äôs you, and really it‚Äôs me‚Äî
A perfect mirror of our own love to bleed.

I‚Äôll usher your dreams in the direction of love.
And yet, love is all, and we are so hungry?
So if you can wake, I‚Äôd love it if love would let me cook
You breakfast.

Till then, we wait.
With your plate warm, my eyes soft,
Contemplating my loss.
Inadvertently obsessed.

***

Believe what you want, and I‚Äôll respect it. I think with the things I‚Äôve seen, I am starting to really believe all things can be true at once.

### **Chapter 1**
**Hearts are cups, gold is glue, breaking is tea.**

I‚Äôve always looked outward for love. Little did I know that I, like all things, *am* love. So let me share some with you. Painful, truthful love.

**Yes, it is my fault / No, it's not your fault**

No, it‚Äôs not my fault you can‚Äôt see the love that I give,
when the words break down and so we pick up the stones,
And we brandish our sticks.

No, it‚Äôs not my fault when enough is enough and you‚Äôre taking the piss,
Because the water I give you, you just don‚Äôt want to drink.
And it must be you, when my logic is sound,
And these other people share this love that abounds.

Could it be my fault?
After all of this shit that I felt that you did,
Could I be the one who‚Äôs far too quick
to pick up these sticks?
And get angry at you because you‚Äôre angry at me?
But where did it start? This shared rage, done by us?

I guess it is my fault.
Not just me, but these other men that I see‚Äî
the ones who bite, who cut down love with their teeth.
Yeah, it is my fault. And I guess it is *we*,
because we are the same, and we want to be free.

So please, I will say that in all that, I forgot that you‚Äôre part of that we.
And I‚Äôm inadvertently lost.
I know love is real, and it‚Äôs easy for me,
but when it comes down to you, it turns back to me.
Yes, it is my fault.

**Why do we keep hurting each other?**

I don‚Äôt know why I'm here in this world anymore.
I‚Äôm made for love
I'm made for more.
I worked too hard to shed all these masks.
just to crawl on the floor.
I've spent so long with my foot in the door.
that these silly dancing feet are getting awfully sore.
Does anybody make real shit anymore?
See, you‚Äôve been asked this before and it woke me up to it.
Are all these people scared, or just didn‚Äôt intuit
the fact that love is dead and dying and we're doomed into ruin?

**I'll NEVER STOP**

My problem is I‚Äôll never stop.
I get asked, ""Is this exhausting, trying to love?""
Yeah. It is so exhausting.

I always wanted love, really, and I still do. But being a conduit for it now, it must be respected and met, not taken for granted. I have a responsibility not just to me, but to the bits of God that are in me.

When I share the tea that is me, when I share love, I must do myself the honour of ensuring the people I love know how to hold the cup.

That they like and appreciate the taste of my particular tea. It can be bitter at times, for sadness runs in me deep. But it is rich in nutrients for the soul, and at times sweet as candy, with many flavours to choose from.

All the flavours.
All the notes.
One me.

You're all goddesses and god's, too.

I believe we all have agency. And we all, whether feeding the parasite or working through genuine self-love, have an effect on the cosmos and an affect on consciousness.

Big or small, love or pain, it's all in defiance of entropy. We need to be braver, though. We need to ask questions.

And we need to trust in children and dogs.

And silly lunatics like Craig from down the road, who‚Äôs been ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù for years but really knows what‚Äôs up. üòÇ

I'll probably be a Craig one day.

I'm grateful for it all.


### **Chapter 2**
**Some reasons why I feel this way, some reasons why you might relate.**

On self-love; I think something skewed into today's mentality is the isolated idea of ""working on
yourself"" I think that people mask their hurt when they don‚Äôt share.

Talking about our traumas and experiencing them in the light of grace with somebody that loves us wholly is the most healing thing we can do.

And if we all did this for each other, the world would be just a little brighter.

The illusion is separation.

We like to hold on to our illusion, I‚Äôve found.

It's necessary for the one to be many.

It isn‚Äôt necessary to lie though.

We love to lie to ourselves, and we lie, thinking we love ourselves. I think people know that if they tell themselves the truth, they then have to tell the world the truth. For a person who lies to themselves but is truthful with the world is surely unwell. Does he know that he is the world? And that the world is him? The universe blinking and, for a split second, seeing itself.

Deep down, yes. Otherwise, there would be no issue with telling the truth.

My pain was a stowaway inside my heart, and I believed it would simply go away if I ignored it. A lie to myself.

I didn‚Äôt ignore it‚ÄîI shielded it from those closest to me. A stowaway that I had fallen for despite myself, hiding it from the love that lives there too. I thought he‚Äôd leave and eventually die of starvation because I wasn‚Äôt feeding him. But I‚Äôd fed him much, unknowingly, and he can draw sustenance from many a place.

And he did. And I missed it.

I made wrong assumptions and I chose incorrectly. Most importantly, I lied to myself. This pain‚Äîit is not a stowaway.

It‚Äôs a parasite.

And most of us love it instead of ourselves. That is why we think we‚Äôre starving him, but we‚Äôre actually not. If we are carrying this parasite, it clouds our vision and alters us, making us weak while it grows stronger.

Why doesn‚Äôt anyone ever tell us life is about love? Maybe some do, but I never heard them. Or maybe the lies wouldn‚Äôt let me hear that either.

It took me 30 years of fighting tooth and nail to learn this truth, but a lot of people can‚Äôt accept it. Accepting love means letting go. It means trusting that if you love everything‚Äîand I mean *everything*: your stubbed toe, your cold coffee, your ex, your childhood bully, a perpetrator of your abuse‚Äîand if you love and forgive them with the same fierceness with which you love and cherish the things that are easy to love, then *he* may starve. And he may mourn that he can‚Äôt spread into the world.

This is what I believe, so take it as you will. I think we are meant to endure suffering, but nobody said it has to be ours alone. We all have to feel it. But we don‚Äôt have to hold it or let it go alone.

Your pain, your anger, and your doubt. Rubble from the explosion that is your rock bottom. The guise, the pain, and the lies that you used to build the self around are now your prison. Heavy, burdensome, and entrenching.

Trust in gratitude. And trust in love.

The unloved self is a prison.

Lessen the weight for the people you love. In doing this extremely courageous thing, you may learn to hold their pain for as long as they need. And when they are ready‚Äînot when you are, however long that may be‚Äîremind them that they can finally let it go.

Killing the parasite, one day at a time.
That‚Äôs love. And it‚Äôs sacred.

No wonder we hurt. It's a wonder we love at all. No wonder we romanticize our pain while it eats us. We‚Äôve forgotten how to help each other. We‚Äôre confused because our ultimate act of selflessness has become selfishness.

Turns out we are meant to carry pain, just not for too long. And it‚Äôs a load made for many.

Even if you can‚Äôt share mine with me, I‚Äôd be grateful to help carry yours one day. If you let me.

Inadvertently lost.

### **Chapter 3**
**You can't cook with love out of a dirty kitchen.**

It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve been here. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm here. I worked so hard, and still, I couldn‚Äôt win.

I‚Äôm here because I have a disease. I realized this as I wrote this, and upon editing, I now love that disease. It made me, me.

Well, realize again.
How many battles must I lose before the war is won?
And which side will win?
Who will I be?
Will I die young? Or lose myself?
Will I have a family? Success?

I act like I‚Äôm strong, and some people believe it. Really, I am weak and lost. I *was* strong, but still broken. To be strong and whole‚Äîthat is the new goal. To ensure this never happens again. To become the me I‚Äôm meant to be, if my health allows it. If I have enough time.

I think that failure and pain and self-sabotage are what lead to what we call rock bottom. In this place that I know well. This place that I‚Äôve spent most of my adult life in. This place that is home to me lately. And every time I come here, I dismantle a small part of myself. And I still haven‚Äôt learned how to put these pieces back together‚Äîhow to make who I was, who I will be, what I want to be.

I want to be great. I want to be loved‚Äînot by many, but by a few. Those few I may one day be honoured enough to call my family. But for now, I‚Äôm in limbo.

Family. I have family, but so many of us carry this hurt‚Äîthe same, or worse. I want, more than anything, to help heal that hurt. And I have met a few I‚Äôd call my family along the way‚Äîunlikely people that I love as much as a broken man like myself can. Men that inspire and motivate me. Women that console and humble me. I want to be present for all of them.

If you know this is about you, just know: You are the difference. And I love you. You are why I can never, ever stop. Never quit. Never lose myself. And it will be because of you that I find myself.

And again, upon writing, I have realized that I am loved by many, for which I am so truly grateful.

But such a monumental task, finding oneself. And if I‚Äôm honest, I know not where to begin.

But one thing I have learned‚Äîas a chef facing monumental tasks‚Äîis that you‚Äôre just one prawn peeled, one carrot blanched, and one onion brunoised away from being finished.

But in life, like in the kitchen, the work is never, ever done. As one of my old chefs used to say: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always time to clean.‚Äù

So, seeing as I have all this time, I think it‚Äôs time to clean.


### **Chapter 4**
**Bravery is a contradiction.**

The hardest part about cleaning the pain we hoard is knowing where to start.

What part of the house to tackle first.

Sometimes we just need to be braver and start.

But bravery is a contradiction.

There is no need for it in the absence of fear. I believe that it is a language more than an emotion. People have always told me I‚Äôm brave, but I‚Äôve never *felt* brave. Maybe they were comforting my inner child‚Äîfor how could you not hear him cry? Maybe they mistook my innate ability to fight for bravery?

Fear, on the other hand, knows me well. And beckons to me. We‚Äôve been friends for as long as I can remember‚ÄîI daresay, longer.

This fight I‚Äôve always fought is no longer against the anger that I place in the hands of others as a means to create a target, calling them my ‚Äúenemy,‚Äù while the greatest enemy is within me. I trusted in fear, for he was strong‚Äîand so, how could he be wrong? I closed my mouth. I wore my masks. Until I forgot who I was. Until he was my master and I invoked him in others.

Now, I‚Äôve been more people, worn more masks, than I can even remember. So many versions of me floating around in so many people‚Äôs heads. None of them me. All of them, me. All for fear of not being accepted.

And so‚Äîwhat does that make me? Certainly not brave.

It made me a survivor, though. I think regret is just fear in its old age‚Äîthe things left to eat at you because you heeded fear‚Äôs call and never learned its language.

That language, I think, is bravery. The strength to do what you want to do and be who you want to be, regardless of failure or heartbreak. To advocate for yourself, the vulnerable, and the people you love. The bravery to be whole. The bravery to love yourself.

The understanding that‚Äîinstead of cynicism and anger‚Äîthe best mask you can wear is empathy for all and gratitude for everything, whether good or bad. Grace, through love. This mask takes years to craft, but it‚Äôll last you forever.

How many times have you been broken, only to realize you‚Äôre still whole?

The graceful angels of bravery are a part of our everyday lives, and we, for the most part, are blind to it. There is something about living in the now that makes you brave.

Do you know who I think are the bravest creatures we know? Dogs.

They have coexisted with the most dangerous predator to ever exist. Co-evolved, even. Who is this dangerous predator, you may ask? Well, find a mirror.

But they didn‚Äôt just co-evolve; they fell in love with us. Dogs are grace. If you have ever been bonded to a dog, you know that dog would lay its life down for you. Your wants come before its needs. They are pure like children, but without all the ifs and buts. Dogs pass on at about 15. Children start asking why you weren‚Äôt perfect. I know I did. If only I loved my mum like a dog instead of a silly child. I guess somebody absorbed in self doesn‚Äôt have that canine proclivity to just love, despite the mistakes.

A dog I love has never called me a junkie.
A dog I love has never told me to grow up.
A dog I love has never even asked me why I refuse its love when it knows that love is the truth.

A dog I love just kept loving me.

Isn‚Äôt that the bravest thing, to trust so in love? ‚ÄúDogs are better than us.‚Äù A thing we say to ground ourselves without realizing it.

And we are right.

I hope we all start to hear the messages we leave for ourselves soon. It‚Äôs hard knowing a language nobody else seems to want to speak.

The language to take action.

For us Action is a precise mixture of knowing and doing and trusting.

Children and Dogs skip these complications and instinctually use love instead.

knowing and doing are distinctively separate things and to synthesize them into action and trust, well that takes a massive amount of love for yourself.

### **Chapter 5**
**The chosen path is folly when life chooses you.**

They tell us pick a thing and stay with it,
specialize, become a king.
Buy some gold, you‚Äôll be content;
this a sin we must repent.

Life will mould you in its way,
Seeds do sow, you know what they say.
Your steps a hoe, these boots a rake,
Your stride will give or it will take.

So how can one undo a life,
redo it new, not out of spite?
Undo that fear and listen clear,
keep those that love you very near.

Neighbours‚Äô in this net of life,
we do not start with our archetype.
Love and fear, both divine.
One for we, and I for one.
Your choices shape who you will be.
Nature's love in steadfast trees.

**The funny thing about trying...**

One thing I‚Äôve learned is if I want a thing too much, it never comes. I‚Äôve wanted a partner so long, neglecting myself in the process. I worked really hard in my jobs to be the best but just ended up so stressed. I‚Äôve tried to help my family through telling and berating. I‚Äôve tried so hard to ‚Äúchange‚Äù so many times.

But what is change? Well, everything, really. Nothing has permanence, except, I believe, love. Conscious experience is eternal. It‚Äôs the dream. It is constant as long as there are things to dream.


And as consciousness flows like a river in an endless sea of entropy, with complexity rising within it, defying physics so blatantly‚Äîwords and numbers and flesh and bone and brains possible because of silly green things

The miracle of synthesising innate gas, life-giving water, and starlight and making sugar and oxygen‚Äîwe, with our greed and ignorance, still ask, ""Where is the magic?""


When we *are* it. Silly.
My advice?
Trust the magic.
Love more.
Care less.
Give grace.
Share food.
Pat a dog.
Kiss your mum (or if might)

Just fucking love more.

Looking for a creative solution to some side hustling.  I build and sell desktops for hobby/extra cash but have run into a few odd balls that left me not wanting to bring them to my house anymore to let them see the system run/test it.

Was curious if my EF4 Power Station is enough to run a mid-high end desktop for say 10-20 minutes?

  
The ideal is that I basically am just running the desktop out of the trunk of my suv at a coffee shop or something enough that someone could run a quick benchmark or test on it.",1,1760919950.0,Ecoflow_community,4,1.0,False

I have had my Barista Pro for about 6 months. Since I have had it, the steamer will slowly lose pressure before the milk reaches 68 C. Does the machine have some sort of built in shutoff? Sometimes it will reach temperature just fine, and other times I have to turn the dial off, then back on to get the milk to my desired temperature. I have wondered if it is a fault with my machine and I need to return it?

I generally make 2 coffees per day, but I recently had family over and made 5 coffees back to back and the steamer stopped working at one point, only putting out a tiny fraction of steam, not enough to heat the milk. I also noticed that sometimes the steamer is full force (splatters milk when i insert the milk jug) and other times it is less force and doesnt splatter the milk.

Today, ladies, gentlemen, and non-binaries, I have a tale of copious amounts of water.

Dramatis personae in order of appearance:

Me: Your narrator 

CE: Chief Engineer

GM: General Manager 

DG: Distraught Guest

AGM: Assistant General Manager

So here I am, working the audit shift at my Frampton. It‚Äôs mostly slow, might as well do some financial administration work too. Just a check to post and a few invoices to enter, type, type, type‚Ä¶

Done! Ah, perfect timing, it‚Äôs 2 AM, time to start making coffee‚Ä¶

Wait, what‚Äôs going on over there? Oh HELL TO THE NO. There‚Äôs water coming from the ceiling. And the floor is flooded too. Crap. I head up to the 4th floor, and can‚Äôt find any water up there. Better call CE.

(Dials phone)

CE: Hello Mazda.

Me: Hello CE. Sorry to wake you, but this really couldn‚Äôt wait. The ceiling in the lobby is leaking. I need help locating the source.

CE: All right, I‚Äôm coming. (Hangs up)

I also call AGM and tell her what‚Äôs going on. I promise that as I find out more, she will too.

CE gets here and we head up to the 4th floor. The water is coming from 4DD. CE knocks on the door.

DG: Who is it?!

CE: Engineering.

DG: I‚Äôm not dressed!

While she gets dressed, CE goes upstairs to see if the leak could be on the 5th floor. It‚Äôs not.  
So he calls the GM to come in as well.

DG, now being decent, opens the door to reveal that the entire room is flooded. The AC unit is running like a faucet. CE gets in there and shuts off the water supply to the AC. While he‚Äôs doing that, DG gathers her things.

DG: My heart is pounding so hard!!

Me: I completely understand where you‚Äôre coming from, and were I in your position, I‚Äôd be freaked out too. I‚Äôm really sorry about this, so let me try to make this right: we‚Äôre going to get you a better room, and if my manager approves, I‚Äôll take this entire night off.

DG: Not your fault, but that would be great.

Me: Okay, let‚Äôs at least get you into that better room.

We go downstairs, and I get DG into her better room. Time to call AGM.

(Ring ring)

AGM: Hello Mazda.

Me: Hello AGM. We determined that the leak came from the HVAC in 4DD, which was occupied. We moved the guest to 3AA. I also informed her that if you approve, I can take the whole night off because leaking HVACs aren‚Äôt supposed to happen. May I do that?

AGM: Yes, absolutely.

Me: Very well. I‚Äôll take care of that as soon as the audit is finished. Try and have a better night, okay?

AGM: Thank you, Mazda. You too. (Click)

CE and GM come back and are placing buckets wherever there‚Äôs dripping.

Me: Hello GM.

GM: Morning, Mazda. When did you notice this?

Me: Around 2 AM when I was going to make coffee. I tried to determine the source on my own, and then I called CE.

GM: Gotcha. I gotta check the bathrooms. (He does so) F&@$!!!! Excuse my French.

Me: I don‚Äôt care, GM. I‚Äôve heard it all.

I bring up a mop and start swabbing the lobby. GM takes over that and lets me get back to my own work.

Later, GM lets me know that this is beyond what we can do at the property level, so he‚Äôs calling FloodRooter. Great. Another invoice for me.

As I‚Äôm making the final urn of coffee, CE comes into the kitchen to dump out a light globe that had filled with water. Lovely.

CE: This hasn‚Äôt happened in years!

Me: That‚Äôs good. In the meantime, I put 4DD out of order until we can get it fixed.

CE: Good. Thanks, Mazda!

And I regale the tale to my relief when she comes in to relieve me at 7.

1ob5ktt,https://i.redd.it/60ipgtait5wf1.jpeg,Ideas for welcoming / inviting / encouraging young folks to No Kings (or to create new forms of protest) ü§úü§õ,"This one‚Äôs for Cam:

Thought it might be helpful to start a thread where we respond to what he said re his gen and their disappointment.

While I sort of cringe myself that their gen thinks if THEY protest things will immediately change, I am not here to victim blame youngsters that DO deserve more than we‚Äôre offering.

So here goes:

üìú Open Letter to Millennials, Y & Zoomers: 
Signed like a petition by olds published on indie sites like the BW and TikTok, and reposted widely by all of us. Project it on the Wash Monument, make videos ASKING for their support. Address their misgivings, generational tone deafness, and commit to ASKING for their support not demanding.

üìÜ Change No Kings to Sunday Mid-Day:
Millennial parents have sports on Sat, college kids want to be at Gameday, people have church Sun AM. Giving up essentially ones only ‚Äúday off‚Äù isn‚Äôt too hard but is pretty precious for people who honestly never really stop working, parenting, doing stuff.

ü•™Add Food, Tailgate & Festival Vibes:
Invite public art installs, engage Burners for ideas, host after parties at local restaurants / bars / parks so folks can mingle or ask them to bring their trucks and grills out. Think Color Run or create a social challenge. Try and establish a new Guinness World Record for most people wearing inflatables. Create a contest or game. Invent a No Kings snack, delicacy or celebrate the sandwich heard round the world. Don‚Äôt rely solely on party apparatus to do this: THE BULWARK SHOULD LET LOCALS BE REPS WHO CAN HOST NO KINGS TAILGATES.

üèÜSpeaking of Sports: 
Encourage college students, alums, and parents to rep No Kings at the field / in the parking lot. Offer coffee, donuts, brek tacos, socialize protesting as a community event. College Dems / Cause groups or merely alum groups could self-organize. TIGERS > KINGS. HOYAS > KINGS. ‚ÄúWHO WILL WIN TODAY‚Äù raffles to galvanize people to stop by a tent or tailgate.

üèõÔ∏èRe: Organizing Alumni:
While there are many college Dem groups there are few college alumni political groups. Yeah yeah, no one wants that BUT, a lot of alums want cross-party ways to find one another. It‚Äôs a good networking opp beyond being pro-democracy. Kids need jobs. They want to work for people that aren‚Äôt jerks or jerk companies that bend the knee. Ideal would be an alumni putting his biz on the line and sponsoring a No Kings tent during game days on one specific day. Don‚Äôt do it all the time. Just once a season.

üíí Re: Sundays & Faith-Based Groups:
Make going to the protest what you do after church. Esp for us Catholics and lapsed Catholics. It being right after morning mass and before evening masses is ideal. FAITH IN ACTION is a must. Putting it on Sunday increases this probability. It is a form of community service and youth groups should understand the history of religious freedoms and protesting / fighting for rights. This ground should not be ceded to Pro-Lifers alone anymore. Imply a sense of sacredness to ENCOURAGE democracy as a spiritual expression- bc it is!

üé∏Spontaneous Music: 
No one wants preachy artists per se, but cameos wherein famous or semi-famous musicians and comedians show up to anything above and play a few songs, is a win IMO. Be real. Like Dave Matthews just milling about the protest with his I Am Antifa sign was glorious. Same with George. But give them somewhere to meet and mingle with impromptu A-Listers

ü™ßCurrent Older Protesters: 
Make signs that literally say COME JOIN US, YOU ARE EVERYONES FUTURE, YOU DESERVE BETTER and ‚Äúprotest‚Äù across the street from your local campus. ASK THEM and reward them. Offer to drive. Offer to pay for their uber. HELP them get there. Call your local public school or community college YD group and offer to help drive students.

üßë‚Äçüßë‚Äçüßí‚Äçüßí As For Younger Parents: 
This one‚Äôs the hardest. A lot are not going to go downtown or even the side of the road. Too risky. But organizing neighborhood No Kings Playdates at the park. PRINCESSES > KINGS, SUPERHEROES > KINGS, dress up as your senator or favorite rep / mini-mes, and include a potluck. Parents ARE dying to meet folks that are likeminded. But we need food, activities, safety, and kid-friendly times. Again, no Saturdays. Please.

üßëüèΩ‚Äçüé§Leverage Costumes & Holidays:
The reason this was so big was protesting in the fall is lovely. It‚Äôs right up against Halloween and a good reason to don a costume. Keep doing that. Theme the clothes, pair with seasonal / festive holidays and traditions or a local ritual. Create a costume contest and a global online contest for Who Wore It Best. The internet is an art project. USE IT. 

ü§≥üèΩLastly: PICS & Make History:
Every city and No Kings should say at THIS TIME we will take an aerial portrait of the protest and we want you in it. We will connect all of the protests into one massive google earth image. BE PART OF HISTORY.

These folks want to make a dent in the arc of time. Do they need to get over their own ageism? Sure. But again, it‚Äôs on us to create a wider on ramp. It‚Äôs not about us. It is ALL about them! The country was founded by people under 50. We must remind them and amplify that WE ALL NEED THEM. MORE THAN EVER.

Rant over. Ideas welcome. The tools we need to beat this havent been invented yet. Let‚Äôs get to work. 

(ps if anyone here needs help thinking abt this for your city / town I welcome DMs). 

WE LOVE YOU CAM!

It was a mutual, respectful breakup I had to go back to the US to finish my last year of uni, and we realized our long-term goals and where we want to live in the future didn‚Äôt really line up.

We dated for about 3 months. After the breakup, she said she hoped we can be more platonic and wanted to stay friends, but her texts went from paragraphs to short replies, and eventually we just stopped talking. We‚Äôve been in no contact since September 15th.

I was thinking about reaching out in December when I‚Äôll be back in Canada for a few weeks, maybe to ask if she wants to grab coffee or something. There‚Äôs no bad blood between us, but part of me worries that by then she‚Äôs moved on cause on insta she seems happy, out with friends, living her life, seems like she already forgot about me.

Has anyone here reached out to an ex after a friendly breakup and how did it go?

1ob5ftw,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcoBaddies/comments/1ob5ftw/told_my_boss_i_had_narcolpsy_today/,Told my boss I had Narcolpsy today,"Not really a vent, but an anecdote I guess.

Ive had this part time job for like a year. They know I have weird health issues but its never really been a topic of conversation. 

Today my boss asked like 5 or 6 times if I was awake yet, if I was falling asleep etc. Finally, in a lighthearted way, I said something like 'funny you keep asking the narcoleptic if they are awake, doing my best over here' and explained yes I am narcoleptic, I have had 5 cups of coffee and an energy drink plus all the drugs I can legally take in a day lol. 

I yawned every 3 or 4 minutes for like 2 hours. After I said that, I caught my boss deeply staring at me when I yawned. I know he was trying to check me out in a new way I guess? 

Anyway, feels weird now that I have said something. Ive never hidden it, but it has never come up. I work for myself as well and on my website its in my little bio that I struggle with narcolepsy, and they all have my card so it is possible they have read that on my website if they cared to (though I dont think anyone really has lol). 

No one has asked me point blank what my health issues are so I never explained. 

Boss didnt have any questions for me after that so I dont know if it is being taken seriously or not by him. Serious as in, does he have the Hollywood movie narcolepsy idea or is he open to understanding what narcolepsy really is? 

I find that younger people (I work with kids and teens a lot) are wayyyy more curious and open to understanding what narcolepsy is than adults are. I think that is because there have not been as many nacoleptic tv show and movie characters (always poorly portrayed) in the past 2 decades as there were previously. I have a narclepsy ribbon tattoo on my finger and when a kid at work asks me about it, I tell them. They always have a million followup questions with zero judgement lol. Its kinda refreshing. 

Anyway, just wanted to get this off my chest. ",1,1760919053.0,NarcoBaddies,3,1.0,False

start of luteal -  GF simultaneously wants to be alone, wants to be reassured im not angry at her, wants me to talk to her, and snaps at me for apologizing when I didnt realize she felt this way.  ""dont turn this into a thing"" (I waved at her while walking to the bathroom and she just fucking glares at me so i decided to give her space for the evening)

few days later - things are uncomfortable enough that I felt I had to say something, i try as gently as possible, basically my concerns get dismissed and she says ""Can I go do my work now?"" leaving the conversation unresolved.  I dont really know what to say, eventually i say ""What am i supposed to do? Just Leave?""  She says go ahead, and starts to get upset because she didnt think that meant I would start packing my things.  We fight for hours and the fight becomes about me daring to throw away what we have.  Eventually we made peace.

few days of peace - then at night GF with tears in her eyes asks me if i still want to leave, i say no and am caught off guard and try to reassure her.

next morning (day before period) - I still feel awful and want to check in with her, she gets extremely mad at me for ""wasting 45 minutes of her time"" before she has to go to work. I snapped a little bit but calmed down by the time she got back (i work from home) i calmly suggested i'd just go visit my parents for a few days, she just got mad and told me to get the fuck out and blocks me on everything.

Next few days I feel extremely guilty even though the original concerns I had never got addressed or mattered and considered I had indeed fucked up because I can understand threatening to throw a relationship away so quickly seems fucked, but i am also wondering if any of my feelings are concerns would ever be valid, lol.  She unblocks me and I go over to apologize and we make up and I spend the night and make plans for me to move back in Sunday.  Things again seem fine

Now Sunday - She texts me saying she is really not doing well, half blaming me half freaking out from all the stress and said she hasnt been eating or doing any chores, I was concerned and catching up on work due to all the drama, but moved back over a bit early and brought some lunch.  I unpacked and we ate and things seemed to be ok, but then I made the mistake of rinsing the dirty dishes that were in the sink, I opened the dishwasher and was starting to make space so i could put the 2 dirty dishes in, she snaps at me and says that the dishes are clean, (I hadnt done anything other than open the dishwasher and move a coffee mug with clean hands, its not like i dripped the dirty dishes water all over the clean dishes or anything - not to mention I would have just put all the clean dishes away once i realized..........................).  I just froze for 30 seconds, apologized (not sure what for), she said Im always making excuses, so I pack up my things again and leave.  I dont think I was back over there for 30 minutes, and I thought things would be ok after Friday/Saturday.

Im really sad because things are amazing when she's not like this, and she is super stressed and never wants anyone to help her out she always has to go it alone so it becomes unbearable and impossible.  I know i made a lot of mistakes for dealing with luteal phase, but it was just impossible.  I am going to miss her so much.  Its heartbreaking because she always told me how lonely she was but she just does everything in her power to push me away

For whatever reason no matter how bad she's doing,  she always has the energy to push away the people that love her the most

Sorry for rambling but I have always appreciated the advice and the stories shared here, I tried and failed,  luteal phase lasts way too long its impossible if life was already stressful beforehand.",2,1760919029.0,PMDDpartners,2,1.0,False

College grad, fluent in English, Sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits (because nothing says ‚Äúthrilling drama‚Äù like corporate loopholes) and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who‚Äôs the real master chef.

I don‚Äôt drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine, then yes, I‚Äôm basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less ‚Äúclubbing till 2am‚Äù and more ‚Äúbuilding a pillow fort empire and bingeing Netflix until the cliffhanger leaves me emotionally bankrupt.‚Äù Basically, I‚Äôm a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

Also worth mentioning, I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that‚Äôs a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

About You

You‚Äôre in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use ‚Äúthere,‚Äù ‚Äútheir,‚Äù and ‚Äúthey‚Äôre‚Äù correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that‚Äôs more than just ‚Äúhey‚Äù (plot twist: you‚Äôre actually interesting). You‚Äôre the type to send random memes that perfectly capture the chaos of life because sometimes a well-timed GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don‚Äôt smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix, available on demand, not in real life. If you‚Äôre thoughtful, communicative, and the type who remembers the small things (like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog), we‚Äôll get along just fine.

So the other day I did a quick meditation on the morning with my coffee and in my mind, a black dog and a snake came to me. They were both very sweet.

I asked for a sign since I figured why not... And that day I got a small one. (a coworker who's covered in tattoos randomly showed me one I somehow missed - a giant raven on his arm. That felt like enough for me! 

I also did a tiny offering which I have on my windowsill now as I don't really have a proper altar. A clove of garlic, an egg in a wine glass and honey with granola in a cup next to it. Idk if this is enough, or if I should leave it, or anything.

I also don't really know what to do next. I'm a little afraid if I'm honest of messing something up, or not being able to do it long term, or of not having the time or energy. I came from a Christian background and am agnostic/atheist now and part of me doesn't want to go back to religion but I feel this is somehow different.

I feel that right now in my life I could use her help as keeper of keys and liminal spaces, of finding a new apartment, getting out of depression, protection from less than healthy people in my life.

""F3! Nooo...whoops. Hello."" A disheveled looking long-haired, bearded gaian man... no, a *terran* man, in fine silk pajamas staggered through the portal. He looked like he'd been trying to hit the brakes chasing the robot cat and ran into the portal unintentionally. I started sprinting from the control room to the enfuckulation chamber, leaving Admiral Kim's 'observers' in my dust. Space dwarves are not noted sprinters.

The terran straightened up and took in the room. A subspace enjigglerizer pointed right at his head, and a giant spider next to a humongous snail. The rest of the room contained a plethora of technology. A broad smile grew across his face as he realized he was, in fact, conducting a first contact. ""Hey fellas, I don't suppose you guys understand what I'm saying? You seen any apes around that look like me?"" 

While he talked, F3-L1-N3 started to skulk around the room, sniffing about, like cats do in a new place.

The spider chittered and his translator-box spoke, ""We understand you perfectly, mammal. And she's on her way, I'm sure."" 

I skidded, breathless, into the room. In time to hear the terran say,

""Hot diggity damn, you guys have some fucking fast translator technology. Don't even have to do the whole Darmok and Jelad song and dance. Not gonna lie, I'm a little bummed we don't get to this time.""

I tried to talk but the sprint had left me winded. I needed to get in better shape. Jimbonk said exactly what I was thinking for me, almost like we shared a base mind or something. 

""The Federation of Allied Planets has more than six hundred species, each with a dozen primary languages, at *minimum*. Add to that, most of those languages have distinct dialects out the wazoo and... well, of course we have amazing translators."" 

""Ahh, well when you put it that way."" The terran said. ""It makes perfect sense.""

There was a flicker of blue light. A handsome looking *Earth* man, fit, clean shaven, sporting a military haircut, popped out of the enfuckulation event horizon. This new man basically the opposite of this doughy, bearded terran hippie in fine silk pajamas. 

""Dilt... Fine work *you* did getting the translation protocols set up, that was incredibly fast."" He was wearing what appeared to me to be a military uniform. 

""Oh yeah, no problem. And uh... look, a girl us."" This... 'Dilt' had noticed me, and clocked me for what I was immediately.

""Seems like something Jim would do,"" the fit Earthling replied. He walked over and extended a hand. ""Ingamar Ma-Ana, an anagram as a man. A pleasure to meet you."" 

We shook hands. There was no... sudden transference of memories or techno-magical spark or anything like that. We'd have to exchange memories of the years since coming down the old fashioned way, by telling one another stories. But there was a *feeling* like I was meeting my long lost triplet brothers after our parents split us up at birth. I think Ingamar felt it too, because our handshake lingered a moment longer than felt normal.

""I'm Jimantha Jimsonson, and this is Jimbonk and Jimelet Du Fromage. Also Jimsonsons,"" I introduced the room.

""Ha! Jim really Jimmed you all up didn't he? I'm guessing these two are some of your fractal mind shards, made flesh. Awful kind of Jim to actually instantiate them."" Ingamar was correct, and quick smart. Fit in body *and* mind. ""Anyhow, that slovenly fellow is Dilt Bifferent.""

I snorted back a laugh at his name before he started defending himself. 

""Slovenly? I..."" Dilt took a beat to calm himself before speaking. I immediately detected a big brother-little brother vibe here. ""You try defending your planet from the scourge while raising a bunch of human and krethellic children together in the same household and see if you still got time for your little workouts.""

""Brother, you live in silk pajamas, and don't necessarily bathe daily. Besides, Terra has had a full platoon of Purifiers now for almost a year, so you ain't personally defending shit.""

""Jim's taint, Ingamar! I was *trying* to not look like a total piece of shit in front of our new sister and... cousins?""

""I'll accept cousins."" Chittered the Jihakoduten Jimolean. The Dungelar nodded his agreement with his extended eye-stalks. 

The robot cat, had been stalking about, as cats do, and found itself between the spider and the snail, where it sat down to await being pet. Whoever had programmed this cat had done an excellent job. Every ear rotation, tail flick and leg movement felt real, felt natural. It was clearly a robocat, but I'll be damned if it didn't feel like it was *alive*.

""Well are you two gonna pet him or not? He clearly wants some attention."" Ingamar gestured to the robokitty, as it rolled over and showed its robobelly. 

""Brrrup."" It made noise to entice them.

""I... I get to pet a kitty-cat?"" Jimbonk extruded a slimy hand and touched the robot cat's belly. F3 dutifully simulated purring. Jimelet Du Fromage also extended one cautious, pokey-stabby limb to pet the kitty too. 

Slimy and pokey pet the non-flesh cat and I could almost feel their joy radiating off them. I didn't even know snails and spiders *could* cry tears of joy.

""Well... This has been fascinating."" Commander Stone had joined us. ""But this clearly isn't a connection to the other FAP built wormhole maker.""

""Subspace Enfuckulator."" Five voices corrected in chorus.

The Earthlings and Terrans had connected up a couple years prior, just in time for Earth to save Terra's ass (and the Krethillic) from becoming Scourge breakfast.  

Since then the technology from Earth had significantly advanced the scourge fighting capabilities of the Terran-Krethellic alliance. There were scourge strikes on both planets in the Terran system, but they had been defeated without significant loss of life, and additionally they had managed to protect their colony worlds with a little assistance from Earth. There was only a few of them.

After we had chatted a little, my brothers brought their friends through the portal, and they started uploading data and upgrading technology around our little space station. F3-L1-N3 wandered the halls, getting pet by all the non-mammals, and assisting the humans with their engineering work in a way that a cat really shouldn't be capable of. I guess the 'robo' part of the robokitty was a manufacturing robot. 

They brought me through the portal too, into wormhole central station to show me what we were working with. If needed, trillions could live in wormhole central, spread across all the domed chambers. They'd built a small town in the space around the Gaia portal. Fusion generators, green houses, homes, entertainment, it was quite the surprise to find *that* inside the portal. A nice surprise for a change. Maybe I would allow myself to have a little hope.   

Designs for fleet sized enfuckulators were broadcast to all Jimolean stations, Admiral Kim was briefed on on the situation and I'll be damned if he didn't actually start sending supplies to the other stations without a moment's hesitation. 

He and Ingamar had a call that lasted roughly an hour. Admiral Kim seemed like to Ingamar much more than me... I suppose stealing his clothing within the first few minutes of meeting him probably permanently ruined his opinion of me. I *guess* that's fair.

Once the conversation with Admiral Kim was done, Ingamar ordered his team inside portal central station to start unloading. Unloading what you might ask? 

A whole ass apace station worth of parts and tech for a fleet sized enfuckulator. 

It took the Earthlings less than a week working with the Jimoleans and the support staff that Captain Kim sent our way to get the designs for integration worked out. Basically... the Jimolean enfuckulator was going have a whole Earth-style fleet-sized enfuckulator built onto it. The earthlings had decided 'why bother having a big enfuckulator *and* a small one as separate space stations when you could combine them and save on parts. Gotta give them credit, it is an efficient use of enfuckulation materials.   
___
My brothers and I were having a breakfast together in Ingamar's place inside wormhole central station. It was the first meal that was just the three of us since they'd appeared in my life. Dilt usually eats with his family, and I usually eat with the Jimoleans, but we'd made the time for this this morning. F3 was plugged into the wall for one of its short naps/charging cycles.

""So what's with the robo-cat, Ingamar."" 

""F3? Oh, I uhh... Well that's a silly story.""

""Tell her anyway."" Dilt said through a mouth of that foul Krethellic stuff he enjoys.

He'd tried to get me to eat his alien family's cuisine, but like Ingamar, I found it disgusting. Instead, Ingamar and I ate leftover lasagna from the night before. It was made with pasta actually from Italy on real-life, honest to goodness Earth. Gaia had a lot of, 'Italian style' pasta makers. There would be lawsuits about it later, but that's for another story on another day. Ingamar spent most of his commission money from his military rank on importing delicious things from Earth. Wormhole shipping rates were outrageous and the military only important what was needed, not luxury pasta. 

""Okay. So initially F3 was ordered as a robo companion for Jim when he was locked up in the grippy sock hotel while he was still borrowing this body.""

""I'm gonna need to you to roll that back. Jim had your body? In a grippy sock hotel?""

""Yeah, and I had his hyperspace shunt in the form of an android body, at first. James dumped out the purgers all over Earth at the same time as we all dropped. Quite the debacle, and since Jim seemed more or less like one of them, grippy sock hotel.""

""Oh shit, so we must have got audited then. James fucked up Jim's plans, and Jim had to muddy up the rules to slip out?""

""Precisely. And then... for some reason, when Mafdet came around to visit me, she kicked me in the gut so hard it made me barf in that robot body. A nasty little black ball.""

""Oh... she brought that to me not that long ago. We used it to power the enfuckulator.""

""Gross dude."" Dilt offered his bifferent wisdom.

""I wonder where she stored it all those years between."" Ingamar took a sip of his coffee. ""Anyhow, when she came she brought an entire bed with her, which we used to track down where Jim *had* been, and while there he'd insisted on his right to a robotic companion animal.""

""What?""

""Human rights. One of them is *some* form of companionship, even in 'solitary' confinement. True solitude is beyond cruel. Robotic small animals were deemed acceptable, as that way no living thing needs to die if the accused..."" He made a little neck breaking pantomime. ""... struggles with rehabilitation.""

""I see. So Jim asked for one, and then what? Vanished into thin air. How?""

""As far as we can tell Mafdet teleported him to a space station of the original species that *became* the Scourge. They were just barely space faring when a cloning experiment went... well... Scourgey.""

""I see... I think I'm going to want to read some logs at some point, but continue to tell me about F3.""

""Anyhow, during those early days after 'Intervene, Now!' I ended up in a robot body with a robot cat. I'd go into a fugue state for hours sometimes working on F3. I have faint memories where data cables from my belly plugged in and reprogrammed him with Jim knows what. I gave him better actuators, sensors, power systems, laser weapons... Hell, I upgraded almost every part inside the bot in some way or another before I became a fully meat person. F3's a real, cat of Theseus. Basically only the outer chassis is the same as what I started with.""

""Wow, so you got your robo-ass betray by a real cat, and made a robo-cat to deal with it? Is that why F3 lets all the non-mammals pet it?""

""Maybe,"" Dilt broke back into our conversation. ""I think, perhaps, Jim might have seen this far ahead and realized that deep down, all your little fractal mind shards were at one point human. Therefor they all want to pet a kitty, but Miss Mafdet wasn't going to be down with that. So he set a path in motion to produce a good kitty, smart as a whip at engineering, that would let them pet it.""

""Dilt, that's..."" Ingamar wanted to say crazy, I could see it on his face, but like me, he had a sinking feeling that was, ""... probably true. Dammit I hate feeling like a puppet on a string.""

""Likewise.""

There was a quiet 'ding' indicating F3 was fully charged. I hadn't *avoided* the robot cat, I just... hadn't made time to pet it yet. F3 hopped up onto the table and sauntered into the middle of it. 

""I see, you know we're talking about you, so you're gonna become the proper center of attention?"" Ingamar asked.

F3 replied with a robotic chirrup and made itself a loaf in the center of the table. I had to admit he was kinda cute. ""So why not give him a proper name. F3 feels like a droid name.""

""He *is* a droid."" Ingamar chuckled. 

""Sure, but F3 sounds so sterile. Doesn't it, buddy?"" I put a hand out toward him, and clicked my tongue at him to try to call him over. ""What about... Lucifer? That's a cat's name that's been around at least 1500 years, maybe more.""

""I dunno, F3 has been his name for like ten years now.""

""I'm calling him Lucifer. Great cat name. C'mere Lucifer."" I beckoned him over.

Lucifer stuck his nose out toward me and gave me a cautious sniff. As I reached out my hand to pet him, there was a sizzle above us and a small, cheetah-spotted, snarling, growling, ball of 'don't touch my favorite human' dropped out of hyperspace and swatted Lucifer in the nose. 

The newly named robocat staggered back all the way off the table he was so startled by what happened. Honestly, I think everyone present was just as startled, maybe even Mafdet. She looked at me, at Ingamar, and at Dilt, then she looked straight up, and tilted her head like she was confused, a moment later she jumped up and vanished into thin air. Good to know there's a hyperspace window open, watching us right now. 

""Still keeping an eye on us Abstainer?"" Dilt asked.

We were met with silence. 

Lucifer hopped back up on the table to try to figure out what the hell had just happened to him and where that other cat had come from, or gone to. As he approached me again, Mafdet dropped down once more, this time with a sticky note stuck to the top of her head. 

She panicked shaking her head back and forth, finally deciding to use a paw to remove the offending thing stuck to her. The second she shook that thing off she locked eyes with Lucifer and started snarling. For his part he seemed like he just wanted to be friends. 

She slippity-slap skaddidle-bop bapped him. I could just say she slapped him, but what she did was so much more frenetic than slap. None of it with claw, none with true malice. She worked him back and forth so fast that he ended up standing up on two legs trying to back away, and then she pounced. Slamming robot cat and hyperspace cat both down onto the table in a tangle of limbs.

""Sweet. Meal and a show."" Dilt scooped up his bowl of foul slop just in time to not have it kicked into his face by wrastlin' cats. 

""So do we... stop them?"" Ingamar asked. 

""I mean... it isn't the ideal way to introduce cats, but I think they'll work it out."" I snagged the sticky note. ""This note just says 'yes' in our handwriting in ancient English letters.""

The growling, snarling ball of angry cat noises stopped being so angry sounding. And was replaced with a sound like velcro being rubbed inside a cast iron pan  Mafdet was licking him into submission now, clearly the more skilled at catjitsu. He started making biscuits in the air after being licked a few more times.

""Well, I'm glad that's settled."" Dilt said. ""So you wanna hear about Molly and Amanda and my family?""

""NO!"" Ingamar and I shouted together. Sweet Jim, Dilt sure was Bifferent, but in some ways, just the same as any proud dad. We'd already heard about his family, plenty.

Things were a blur after that breakfast with my brothers. Engineering plans flowed through my nightmares most nights, if I even had the luxury of dreams that is. Most nights were sleepless with the news from all three war fronts. At first it sounded the same as it always had, somewhat dire. We were winning deep space skirmishes here and there, but mostly pyrrhic victories were all we'd manage. 

With the new tech coming from Earth we'd done better defending our worlds than we had with those first few that were hit.

The real bad news was that even the fleets of Earth struggled to gain any actual ground in already scourged systems. Metaphorical subspace trenches were being dug inside actual subspace minefields on both teams. Scourge and non-scourge alike, it was becoming dangerous to go in and out of star systems at warp.

And then, all at once, across all three warfronts of what we'd determined was the whole Scourge life form, it turned inward. All its flesh masses, frigate to mothership sized, turned back toward its own center and it started to bolster its defenses in its thousand lightyear section of the galaxy. The scourge originated near the outer edge of the galaxy in one of the arms, and humans had cleared the back line. If we place Earth at due north, then Gaia was southwest of Earth and Terra was south East. The scourge, trapped between our three cultures.  

Surely there were already several hundred thousand fleshy warp artillery shells headed our various ways, at various speeds, but with the new Earthly detection systems going in around our little portion of the galaxy we were going to stop most of them, and with their Purifier suit designs spread across our entire federation, we'd end what little got through. 

Still, seeing the scourge run was heartening. It was like the Scourge knew that all the children of Sol had reconnected, and it was *afraid*.

He'd tried to get me to eat his alien family's cuisine, but like Ingamar, I found it disgusting. Instead, Ingamar and I ate leftover lasagna from the night before. It was made with pasta actually from Italy on real-life, honest to goodness Earth. Gaia had a lot of, 'Italian style' pasta makers. There would be lawsuits about it later, but that's for another story on another day. Ingamar spent most of his commission money from his military rank on importing delicious things from Earth. Wormhole shipping rates were outrageous and the military only important what was needed, not luxury pasta. 

""Okay. So initially F3 was ordered as a robo companion for Jim when he was locked up in the grippy sock hotel while he was still borrowing this body.""

""I'm gonna need to you to roll that back. Jim had your body? In a grippy sock hotel?""

""Yeah, and I had his hyperspace shunt in the form of an android body, at first. James dumped out the purgers all over Earth at the same time as we all dropped. Quite the debacle, and since Jim seemed more or less like one of them, grippy sock hotel.""

""Oh shit, so we must have got audited then. James fucked up Jim's plans, and Jim had to muddy up the rules to slip out?""

""Precisely. And then... for some reason, when Mafdet came around to visit me, she kicked me in the gut so hard it made me barf in that robot body. A nasty little black ball.""

""Oh... she brought that to me not that long ago. We used it to power the enfuckulator.""

""Gross dude."" Dilt offered his bifferent wisdom.

""I wonder where she stored it all those years between."" Ingamar took a sip of his coffee. ""Anyhow, when she came she brought an entire bed with her, which we used to track down where Jim *had* been, and while there he'd insisted on his right to a robotic companion animal.""

""What?""

""Human rights. One of them is *some* form of companionship, even in 'solitary' confinement. True solitude is beyond cruel. Robotic small animals were deemed acceptable, as that way no living thing needs to die if the accused..."" He made a little neck breaking pantomime. ""... struggles with rehabilitation.""

""I see. So Jim asked for one, and then what? Vanished into thin air. How?""

""As far as we can tell Mafdet teleported him to a space station of the original species that *became* the Scourge. They were just barely space faring when a cloning experiment went... well... Scourgey.""

""I see... I think I'm going to want to read some logs at some point, but continue to tell me about F3.""

""Anyhow, during those early days after 'Intervene, Now!' I ended up in a robot body with a robot cat. I'd go into a fugue state for hours sometimes working on F3. I have faint memories where data cables from my belly plugged in and reprogrammed him with Jim knows what. I gave him better actuators, sensors, power systems, laser weapons... Hell, I upgraded almost every part inside the bot in some way or another before I became a fully meat person. F3's a real, cat of Theseus. Basically only the outer chassis is the same as what I started with.""

""Wow, so you got your robo-ass betray by a real cat, and made a robo-cat to deal with it? Is that why F3 lets all the non-mammals pet it?""

""Maybe,"" Dilt broke back into our conversation. ""I think, perhaps, Jim might have seen this far ahead and realized that deep down, all your little fractal mind shards were at one point human. Therefor they all want to pet a kitty, but Miss Mafdet wasn't going to be down with that. So he set a path in motion to produce a good kitty, smart as a whip at engineering, that would let them pet it.""

""Dilt, that's..."" Ingamar wanted to say crazy, I could see it on his face, but like me, he had a sinking feeling that was, ""... probably true. Dammit I hate feeling like a puppet on a string.""

""Likewise.""

There was a quiet 'ding' indicating F3 was fully charged. I hadn't *avoided* the robot cat, I just... hadn't made time to pet it yet. F3 hopped up onto the table and sauntered into the middle of it. 

""I see, you know we're talking about you, so you're gonna become the proper center of attention?"" Ingamar asked.

F3 replied with a robotic chirrup and made itself a loaf in the center of the table. I had to admit he was kinda cute. ""So why not give him a proper name. F3 feels like a droid name.""

""He *is* a droid."" Ingamar chuckled. 

""Sure, but F3 sounds so sterile. Doesn't it, buddy?"" I put a hand out toward him, and clicked my tongue at him to try to call him over. ""What about... Lucifer? That's a cat's name that's been around at least 1500 years, maybe more.""

""I dunno, F3 has been his name for like ten years now.""

""I'm calling him Lucifer. Great cat name. C'mere Lucifer."" I beckoned him over.

Lucifer stuck his nose out toward me and gave me a cautious sniff. As I reached out my hand to pet him, there was a sizzle above us and a small, cheetah-spotted, snarling, growling, ball of 'don't touch my favorite human' dropped out of hyperspace and swatted Lucifer in the nose. 

The newly named robocat staggered back all the way off the table he was so startled by what happened. Honestly, I think everyone present was just as startled, maybe even Mafdet. She looked at me, at Ingamar, and at Dilt, then she looked straight up, and tilted her head like she was confused, a moment later she jumped up and vanished into thin air. Good to know there's a hyperspace window open, watching us right now. 

""Still keeping an eye on us Abstainer?"" Dilt asked.

We were met with silence. 

Lucifer hopped back up on the table to try to figure out what the hell had just happened to him and where that other cat had come from, or gone to. As he approached me again, Mafdet dropped down once more, this time with a sticky note stuck to the top of her head. 

She panicked shaking her head back and forth, finally deciding to use a paw to remove the offending thing stuck to her. The second she shook that thing off she locked eyes with Lucifer and started snarling. For his part he seemed like he just wanted to be friends. 

She slippity-slap skaddidle-bop bapped him. I could just say she slapped him, but what she did was so much more frenetic than slap. None of it with claw, none with true malice. She worked him back and forth so fast that he ended up standing up on two legs trying to back away, and then she pounced. Slamming robot cat and hyperspace cat both down onto the table in a tangle of limbs.

""Sweet. Meal and a show."" Dilt scooped up his bowl of foul slop just in time to not have it kicked into his face by wrastlin' cats. 

""So do we... stop them?"" Ingamar asked. 

""I mean... it isn't the ideal way to introduce cats, but I think they'll work it out."" I snagged the sticky note. ""This note just says 'yes' in our handwriting in ancient English letters.""

The growling, snarling ball of angry cat noises stopped being so angry sounding. And was replaced with a sound like velcro being rubbed inside a cast iron pan  Mafdet was licking him into submission now, clearly the more skilled at catjitsu. He started making biscuits in the air after being licked a few more times.

""Well, I'm glad that's settled."" Dilt said. ""So you wanna hear about Molly and Amanda and my family?""

""NO!"" Ingamar and I shouted together. Sweet Jim, Dilt sure was Bifferent, but in some ways, just the same as any proud dad. We'd already heard about his family, plenty.

Things were a blur after that breakfast with my brothers. Engineering plans flowed through my nightmares most nights, if I even had the luxury of dreams that is. Most nights were sleepless with the news from all three war fronts. At first it sounded the same as it always had, somewhat dire. We were winning deep space skirmishes here and there, but mostly pyrrhic victories were all we'd manage. 

With the new tech coming from Earth we'd done better defending our worlds than we had with those first few that were hit.

The real bad news was that even the fleets of Earth struggled to gain any actual ground in already scourged systems. Metaphorical subspace trenches were being dug inside actual subspace minefields on both teams. Scourge and non-scourge alike, it was becoming dangerous to go in and out of star systems at warp.

And then, all at once, across all three warfronts of what we'd determined was the whole Scourge life form, it turned inward. All its flesh masses, frigate to mothership sized, turned back toward its own center and it started to bolster its defenses in its thousand lightyear section of the galaxy. The scourge originated near the outer edge of the galaxy in one of the arms, and humans had cleared the back line. If we place Earth at due north, then Gaia was southwest of Earth and Terra was south East. The scourge, trapped between our three cultures.  

Surely there were already several hundred thousand fleshy warp artillery shells headed our various ways, at various speeds, but with the new Earthly detection systems going in around our little portion of the galaxy we were going to stop most of them, and with their Purifier suit designs spread across our entire federation, we'd end what little got through. 

Still, seeing the scourge run was heartening. It was like the Scourge knew that all the children of Sol had reconnected, and it was *afraid*.

What do you guys think I should do?,"My boyfriend (27M) and I (27F) have been dating for ten months now, things are great but I feel like I put in more effort in the relationship than he does. For example, when it was his birthday in March I booked for a hotel and a restaurant and paid for everything. For my birthday, that just passed, I had to organise and book everything and he just paid for half of it. I don‚Äôt really care about the money aspect of it, even though it would be nice if he paid, it‚Äôs just more the thought behind it. I‚Äôve asked him before as to why he doesn‚Äôt organise things and he says he doesn‚Äôt know where to book as he never goes out.

I do understand where he is coming from cause he is VERY VERY introverted and I've seen this from the day we started dating. For example, we only see each other on the weekends but each time it's the same thing: we wake up, go get coffee, come back and he wants to take a nap for 3 hours (he doesn‚Äôt have a sleep condition just loves naps). I have talked to him about this as he lives on the beach and in summer I don't want to be stuck inside doing nothing and want to go out and walk or do things. Thankfully, he did say we won't do that anymore.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love him and our relationship is solid but I just want him to pull his weight a bit when events like this happen. I asked a friend for what I should do for our 1 year anniversary, as I want to book/organise now since our anniversary is close to Christmas, and she said to just leave it in his hands and if he doesn‚Äôt book or organise or even ask me what I want to do then that should give me my answer.

I am in my early 30s and have been thinking how, what *should* be thought of as the bare minimum in social skills, is nevertheless what draws me to people and makes them seem like good friend-material nowadays. 

I‚Äôm talking about simply asking non-transactional questions back to the person one is chatting with. A few weeks ago I had a somewhat impromptu coffee chat with a person from my department who I hadn‚Äôt really met officially until then ‚Äî after the chat I felt so refreshed simply because he had asked me personal questions about myself and followed up on what I said! 

People say socializing or the art of conversing went downhill during/after COVID, which is very much a substantive factor but isn‚Äôt it somewhat basic courtesy to ask about others beyond generic small talk (and short of being invasive)?

I‚Äôve always been more curious about others than interested in telling them about myself, but if I am asked I am happy to tell them the details. If they don‚Äôt ask I assume that they‚Äôre not interested enough to do so. 

I think it paints a rather glum outlook on my social environment/the people around me, if just the execution of the bare minimum gets me thinking they‚Äôve got amazing social skills.

Maybe then people wouldn't butcher it like they do with my real name lol. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life. Someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had terrible luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in investing the time and effort to make things work. Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named shadow\_surf

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about¬†¬†
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

What qualities do I look for in a friend?

* Is a human and breathing üòÇ
* An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

It doesn't matter what your age is or where you're from! Feel free to reach out if you'd like a best friend! :)",2,1760917716.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,1,1.0,False

Hey everyone! I‚Äôm 29 and recently moved to Auckland from India.

I‚Äôm into F1, UFC, gaming, fiction books, the gym, and I‚Äôve recently started running too. I also love movies and I‚Äôm always down to talk about them or discover new ones.

Would be great to meet some people to hang out with, explore the city, or just grab a coffee and chat. Always open to learning new hobbies and trying new things too.

Cheers ‚ú®

I would love to be friend!","Did it work? I'm sure it worked if you're reading this! So hi, I'm shadow\_surf. Imagine if this was my real name. Maybe then people wouldn't butcher it like they do with my real name lol. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life. Someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had terrible luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in investing the time and effort to make things work. Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named shadow\_surf

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about¬†¬†
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing üòÇ
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

It doesn't matter what your age is or where you're from! Feel free to reach out if you'd like a best friend! :)",1,1760917186.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

What do you guys think I should do?,"My boyfriend (27M) and I (27F) have been dating for 10 months now, things are great but I feel like I put in more effort in the relationship than he does. For example, when it was his birthday in March I booked for a hotel and a restaurant and paid for everything. For my birthday, that just passed, I had to organise and book everything and he just paid for half of it. I don‚Äôt really care about the money aspect of it, even though it would be nice if he paid, it‚Äôs just more the thought behind it. I‚Äôve asked him before as to why he doesn‚Äôt organise things and he says he doesn‚Äôt know where to book as he never goes out.

I do understand where he is coming from cause he is VERY VERY introverted and I've seen this from the day we started dating. For example, we only see each other on the weekends but each time it's the same thing: we wake up, go get coffee, come back and he wants to take a nap for 3 hours. I have talked to him about this as he lives on the beach and in summer I don't want to be stuck inside doing nothing and want to go out and walk or do things. Thankfully, he did say we won't do that anymore.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love him and our relationship is solid but I just want him to pull his weight a bit when events like this happen. I asked a friend for what I should do for our 1 year anniversary, as I want to book/organise now since our anniversary is close to Christmas, and she said to just leave it in his hands and if he doesn‚Äôt book or organise or even ask me what I want to do then that should give me my answer.

What do you guys think on this? Any advice?

1ob4ppt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ob4ppt/aita_for_considering_buying_the_townhome_right/,AITA for considering buying the townhome right behind my best friend,"My partner (30m) and I (25f) are in the market to purchase our first home. We live in a medium-sized city where the market is *very* tight (ie. not a lot of inventory and sky-high prices). We‚Äôve been casually searching for a few years but just got serious in the past couple of months. 

The townhouse that we‚Äôre considering purchasing is right behind my best friend‚Äôs (26f) and her husband‚Äôs (27m) home (they rent it from her husband‚Äôs family and will remain there for the foreseeable future). 

My best friend today told me that her and her husband (who I‚Äôve been close with for 8 years) told me they spoke and are uncomfortable with us moving in near them. She told me that she‚Äôs ‚Äúa little uncomfortable‚Äù, but that her husband is ‚Äúvery uncomfortable‚Äù with it. She didn‚Äôt cite any reason as to why. I was pretty caught off guard so I just said ‚Äúthanks for sharing‚Äù. 

To clarify, our reasons for buying have nothing to do with proximity to them. Although, before today I would have added it to the pro list because come on, this is my best friend of so many years I would have been close to. We‚Äôre considering because we like the location and it is the quite literally the only thing on the market right now that meets our needs and comes in within budget. 

The development shares a gate with her property, but we wouldn‚Äôt purchase the units closest to her, we would be on the opposite end (but yes, still close). 

I can‚Äôt imagine why this would be an issue. We see each other 1-2x a week for a coffee, movie, workout class, etc. The four of us have always gotten along. There has never been a boundary issue. 

AITA for not really caring that this makes them ‚Äúuncomfortable‚Äù? I really feel like this is a decision only between myself and my partner, and them sharing this doesn‚Äôt dissuade me at all. Or am I just being unreasonable?

1ob4peb,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ob4peb/she_want_him_inside_her/,She want him inside her,"She woke at four-thirty, the room still shrouded in pre-dawn darkness, the faint glow of the streetlight filtering through the curtains like a secret whisper. No alarm was needed‚Äîshe'd been restless all night, her mind tangled in a web of anticipation and forbidden desire, replaying every stolen glance and whispered promise from the days before. She slid out of bed quietly, her bare feet sinking into the soft carpet, careful not to disturb the steady breathing of her husband beside her. The air was cool against her skin, sending a shiver down her spine that had nothing to do with the temperature.
First, she slipped into her everyday underwear: a simple white cotton bra that cupped her full breasts snugly, the lace trim brushing softly against her sensitive nipples, already hardening from the thrill of what lay ahead. Matching panties hugged her hips, the fabric smooth and familiar, but today they felt like a barrier she couldn't wait to shed. Over it all went the light sundress, floral and innocent-looking, with thin straps that crossed her shoulders and a hem that brushed mid-thigh, swaying gently as she moved. It was the kind of dress that made her feel feminine and free, the soft cotton caressing her skin like a lover's touch. She grabbed the gym bag from the closet‚Äîempty except for a towel, water bottle, and a spare change of clothes, her perfect alibi. ""Heading to the gym for a workout,"" she'd told her family the night before over dinner, her voice steady even as her pulse quickened at the lie. They hadn't questioned it; why would they? She was the reliable office lady, the devoted wife and mother, always putting everyone else first. But not today.
She tiptoed down the stairs, the house silent except for the distant hum of the refrigerator. Slipping out the front door, she felt a rush of cool morning air kiss her bare legs, heightening her awareness of her body. The car started with a soft purr, and she backed out of the driveway, her hands gripping the wheel a little too tightly. The drive took fifteen minutes along empty motorways, the world still asleep under a blanket of stars fading into dawn. Streetlights cast long shadows, and with each passing mile, her thoughts raced ahead: his strong hands on her waist, the heat of his breath against her skin, the way his eyes darkened when he looked at her in the office. Nervousness twisted in her stomach like butterflies taking flight, but so did a deep, aching excitement‚Äîa warmth building between her legs, making her shift in her seat. She imagined his touch, rough yet tender, and her thighs pressed together involuntarily, seeking friction. She passed the gym without a glance, her heart pounding now, turning instead toward the concrete factory where she spent her days buried in paperwork. But today, it was a stage for something far more primal.
At five-thirty sharp, she pulled into the empty parking lot, the gravel crunching under her tires like a hushed secret. No other cars yet‚Äîthe factory wouldn't stir for another hour. The building loomed silent and dark, its industrial edges softened by the dim light. She stepped out, the cool air teasing the hem of her sundress, and walked to the office door with her gym bag slung over her shoulder. Her fingers trembled slightly as she unlocked it, the key scraping in the lock, then she stepped inside and locked it behind her with a decisive click. The office was familiar yet eerie in the darkness: desks cluttered with files, the faint scent of coffee from yesterday lingering in the air. She made her way to her little office, a cozy nook with her computer, a potted plant wilting slightly on the windowsill, and a chair that creaked as she sat down. She didn't turn on the light‚Äîjust sat there in the shadows, her breath coming in shallow waves, thinking about what was going to happen. Her skin tingled with anticipation; she could feel her nipples straining against the bra, her panties growing damp as memories of their flirtations flooded her mind. This was wrong, she knew‚Äîmarried, with responsibilities‚Äîbut the forbidden pull was intoxicating, making her feel alive in a way she hadn't in years.
Time crawled. She watched the clock on the wall, its ticks echoing like her heartbeat. Then, at quarter to six, headlights sliced through the blinds, sweeping across her desk like a spotlight. Her breath caught‚Äîit was him. She stood slowly, her legs feeling weak, and smoothed her sundress, the fabric whispering against her thighs. In a moment of bold impulse, she reached under the hem, hooked her thumbs into her panties, and slid them down her legs, stepping out of them one foot at a time. The cool air hit her bare skin, sending a jolt of vulnerability and arousal through her. She folded the damp cotton neatly and tucked it into her purse, her cheeks flushing hot. No turning back now.
She slipped into the corridor, her bare feet silent on the carpeted floor, and headed to the storeroom‚Äîa long, narrow room attached to the office, lined with shelves on both sides crammed with supplies, tools, and dusty boxes. At the entrance loomed the big steel toolbox, heavy and unyielding, like a sentinel guarding their secret. She walked to the very back, the space growing tighter, the air cooler and mustier, laced with the faint metallic tang of machinery. She leaned against the last shelf, her back pressing into the cold metal edges, and waited, her heart thundering in her chest. She knew he was coming‚Äîcould almost feel the air shift with his approach.
Then, the back office door unlocked with a scrape of key in metal. It swung open, then locked again behind him with a soft thud. The carpet swallowed his footsteps, but she knew he was moving toward her‚Äîpurposeful, unhurried. He entered the storeroom without a word, his silhouette filling the doorway, broad shoulders and familiar stance. The door clicked shut, plunging them into deeper darkness, broken only by faint slivers of light from the office blinds. He walked straight to her, no hesitation, his presence electric. She could smell his clean soap scent mixed with the early morning chill.
His hands found her waist first, warm and firm through the thin sundress, pulling her closer. She gasped softly as he lifted the hem slowly, exposing her bare thighs to the cool air. He dropped to his knees before her, his breath hot against her skin, and parted her legs gently but insistently. The first touch of his tongue was electric‚Äîsoft and slow, tracing up her inner thigh before finding her center. He licked her with deliberate care, flat and broad at first, savoring her taste, then flicking lightly over her clit, building the pressure. She was already so wet, her body responding instantly, a low moan escaping her lips despite her efforts to stay quiet. He slid a finger inside her, then two, curling them just right to hit that sensitive spot, his tongue circling relentlessly. The sensations built like a wave‚Äîwarmth spreading from her core, her hips bucking involuntarily against his mouth. She gripped the shelf behind her for support, her knuckles white, head thrown back as pleasure coiled tighter and tighter. When she came, it crashed over her in shudders, her thighs trembling around his head, a muffled cry caught in her throat. Waves of bliss pulsed through her, leaving her breathless and weak-kneed.
He didn't give her time to recover. Standing smoothly, he turned her around, pressing her face-first against the shelves‚Äîthe cold metal a stark contrast to the heat of his body behind her. She felt him unzip, the sound sharp in the quiet room, and lifted one leg back instinctively, hooking it around his thigh to open herself to him. With her guidance, he slid inside her‚Äîthick and hot, stretching her perfectly, filling her completely. She bit her lip to stifle a gasp, the fullness exquisite. He started slow, deep thrusts that let her feel every inch, his hands on her hips steadying her. Then faster, harder, the rhythm building, their bodies slapping softly in the confined space. She pushed back against him, greedy for more, the friction igniting another fire within her. Pleasure mounted again, her breaths coming in ragged pants, and she came a second time, clenching around him, her inner walls pulsing with release.
He paused, buried deep, his breath hot in her ear as he growled softly, ""Where do you want it‚Äîmouth or inside?"" Her voice was a whisper, husky with need: ""Inside... so I can feel it."" He groaned, thrusting once more, deep and final, holding still as his cock pulsed within her, flooding her with warmth‚Äîhot, thick spurts that she felt every twitch of, intimate and raw. It prolonged her aftershocks, making her shiver with satisfaction.
When he was spent, he pulled out slowly, the sensation leaving her feeling empty and full all at once. He zipped up without a word, his hand brushing her back in a fleeting caress, then turned and walked away. The door clicked shut behind him, and she heard his car engine fade into the distance. She stayed there for a moment, leaning against the shelf, her sundress twisted around her waist, legs still trembling. She felt his cum starting to slide warm and slow down her inner thigh‚Äîa tangible reminder of their stolen moment. A smile curved her lips in the darkness; she didn't wipe it away. Instead, she straightened her dress, smoothed her hair, and left her panties on the floor like a hidden trophy.
Far off, voices echoed‚Äîworkers arriving, the factory humming to life. She walked back to her desk on shaky legs, sat down, and opened her computer as if nothing had happened. But inside, she was glowing, already craving the next time, the secret burning like a flame only she could feel.",0,1760917113.0,offmychest,0,0.5,False

1ob4p3w,https://i.redd.it/y0mui6jlm5wf1.jpeg,"35 [F4M] Midwest, USA. Doing my best to put myself out there. Wanting to find a good hearted, loyal friend who values honesty & authenticity","
*I‚Äôm posting here cause I prefer to have older friends. I‚Äôm not interested in connecting with others in my age group. I have my reasons for that.* 

I‚Äôm an introvert who prefers a cozy night in watching tv and movies while cuddling with my cat. My ideal day on a day off usually includes a trip to the bookstore, where I lose myself in the true crime, psychology, and astrology sections, journaling my thoughts and soaking in the calm atmosphere with an iced coffee. I enjoy going to the movies by myself as well if there‚Äôs something playing that catches my interest. Usually it‚Äôs a horror movie since I‚Äôm a horror fan. Basically I‚Äôm a homebody who prefers only a few close friends that  actually care about me and bother to say hi and check in to see how I‚Äôm doing. I do want to say that I prefer to connect with those who are also single, not because I‚Äôm seeking a relationship but it‚Äôs my personal preference to connect with someone else who is also single so we can have more in common and avoid awkwardness. 

Loyalty and authenticity are important things to me to have in a friendship.Strong emotional/mental connection is also highly important to me. I need to be able to connect deeply emotionally with someone and To be able to think alike and just get each other where there‚Äôs enough chemistry for a lasting friendship to build. Without either of those then the connection won‚Äôt work. I‚Äôm also not at all compatible with anyone who has kids or wants them. So if you have kids or want them, I‚Äôm not the one for you to pursue.Nor am I seeking a romantic relationship. I gravitate toward good-hearted people who are true to their word, and try to have integrity in everything they say and do. I value friendships that are real, unfiltered, and built on mutual trust‚Äîwhere we can be our true selves without pretense. I‚Äôm drawn to those who, like me, embrace their independence and don‚Äôt feel the need to follow the crowd.
A few things to know: I‚Äôm not religious and connect best with others who share a similar non-religious outlook. I‚Äôve also chosen a life without kids and am only compatible with those who feel the same way‚Äîchildfree and happy about it. While I steer clear of politics, I don‚Äôt mesh with anyone who aligns with MAGA views, as I prefer friendships free from divisive ideologies.

If you‚Äôre a loyal, authentic person  who loves deep conversations, quiet nights in, needs emotional/mental connection, we might just click. I do want to be honest that I‚Äôm only open to connecting with others who live in the Midwest area or the closer southern parts like Kentucky, Tennessee and Alabama. I‚Äôm not at all open to connecting outside the states. Drug use/smoking/caping is another dealbreaker. Those are just my personal preferences. ",1,1760917093.0,NewFriendsOver40,0,1.0,False

Long story short, my right sided PT started in September of 2024 and had all the classic VSS signs (stops with right sided neck compression, sounds like a whoosh, worse with exertion, worse with bearing down, worse with crouching, better with coffee, better when turning my head to the right, etc). 

I had a telehealth visit with Dr. Patsalides in April of 2025, was diagnosed by him with classic venous sinus stenosis plus a venous aneurysm, and scheduled surgery with him for July of 2025 only to have my insurance deny it five days before I was due to be stented. 

My insurance denied my ability to appeal and denied me a peer-to-peer. I tried absolutely everything and they would not budge with approving the surgery with anyone except for the handful of neurosurgeons in their network, none of whom seem to have dealt with this particular condition as far as I can tell from my extensive research into them and asking my insurance company. 

SO my only option at this point is to go abroad and I reached out to Dr. Houdart in Paris. I would be paying out of pocket of course, and it's expensive, don't get me wrong, but it's an absolute fraction of the six figure price tag I would've been looking at to go OOP with Dr. Patsalides. 

All this to say, I'm at the airport right now for my flight to France, very nervous and excited, hoping that I can be accepted as a patient with Dr. Houdart and finally have this nightmare behind me. ",6,1760916556.0,PulsatileTinnitus,0,1.0,False

If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life. Someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had terrible luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in investing the time and effort to make things work. Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named shadow\_surf

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about¬†¬†
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing üòÇ
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

Just thought I would make a post helping people out that might want to do the Lares Trail in Peru, self guided. I highly recommend downloading Gaia or another good GPS app. The trail is relatively easy to follow, but it‚Äôs a good measure just to be sure you‚Äôre going the right way. Please note it is best you bring your own food, there are small shops in the towns that sell water, some off-brand Oreos and other small snacks, but certainly not enough to feed you for the hike. We camped every night.

We actually did this in 3 nights and 2 days, but that‚Äôs because we were on a bit of a time crunch and smashed out 2 days in one day. I digress.

Day 1: Lares-Huacahuasi. Getting to Lares looks like going to Puputi Street in Cusco. Walk down the street and you will find a Collectivo (shared shuttle van) headed to Calca. Get off at Calca at the bus terminal and either get another Collectivo or a shared taxi to Lares. We paid 15 soles each for the shared taxi from Calca to Lares (Collectivo is cheaper I believe).

Start the trail at Lares Hot Springs. This is 15 soles entry to get in the baths which, albeit sporting rusty edges to the pools, are a wonderful wind down and muscle relaxer- a great start to the hike! I‚Äôm not sure if you have to pay if you‚Äôre bypassing the pools and just looking for the trail. You can ask someone at the hot springs for help finding the trail head. We were a bit confused finding it but it is right where the lower pools are. Just ask one of the workers in there. You will walk up a little and through some terraces- that‚Äôs when you know you‚Äôre on the right trail.

Day 2: Huacahuasi to Lake Ipsaycocha. This day is mostly uphill and you WILL climb a mountain up to 4385 metres (it‚Äôs windy, cloudy, cold and hard to breathe up there so be prepared for this). The lake is beautiful. We camped there the night on a very downward sloping hill which led to a very cold and uncomfortable night but such is life- you can also stay in a homestay there too I believe. In the morning we walked up the hill to a lady with her family and alpaca farm, and gave her some sols for some tea and coffee.

Day 3: Lake Ipsaycocha-Patacancha-Huilloc. Easy hike sloping steadily downhill for the most part. Not much in Patacancha but a cute town nonetheless. From Patacancha to Huilloc the trail seems to be blocked off at various parts for some reason. We went through around three of the blockages (they were easily bypassed) but after a little while we were stopped by a house being there. We decided to follow a fork in the trail down to the river and to the road instead of trying to go through someone‚Äôs property. We‚Äôre really not sure if Gaia had the maps wrong at the end, or someone had built a property over the trail- who knows. Either way, we walked along the road and decided it wasn‚Äôt worth inhaling the dust from passing cars so got picked up by a Collectivo that took us to Ollantaytambo for 5 soles each. The drive consisted of the 2-3 remaining kilometres to Huilloc where our hike would have ended anyway. We were happy with our decision to call it earlier as looking through the van‚Äôs windows, it didn‚Äôt seem as though there was any trail past where we dropped to the road. From Ollantaytambo we got another Collectivo back to Cusco (10 soles each).

1ob4dbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ob4dbe/sudden_extreme_headaches_with_other_neurological/,"Sudden, extreme headaches with other neurological symptoms","TL;DR: Symptoms suddenly getting much worse, need guidance

28F 5‚Äô2‚Äù ~130 lbs
Diagnoses: HSD, Orthostatic hypotension, DID, gerd, high cholesterol 
Medication: lamotragine, quetiapine xr, bupropion, omeprazole, atorvastatin, vitamin d, melatonin, lorazepam as needed (take less than 10 in a year)
Symptom onset: started at 8 or 9 years old, getting worse over time (~20 years) 
Non smoker, non drinker, occasional coffee. 

I have been struggling with some weird neurological symptoms, most concerning of which being these sudden, extreme headaches that last under 5 seconds. They are literally blindingly painful and will knock me on the floor. It‚Äôs a sudden, sharp pain that tends to come with ‚Äúaftershocks‚Äù. I have a hard time forming thoughts or speaking afterwards, and usually end up with some memory loss when they happen. 

I can usually tell when one is coming (though I can‚Äôt tell when) because for a few weeks/days leading up to them I‚Äôll have small muscle twitches and random pains across my body. It feels similar to being shocked, and there have been times I‚Äôve not noticed that I‚Äôm surrounded by deer flies because the sensation is so similar to their bites. It can almost feel like there is a thread of pain being pulled in some places (usually in my chest) The muscle twitches are visible under the skin, and last a few seconds on and off. They happen in all of my limbs and my abdomen. I don‚Äôt get any sort of aura as far as I can tell. 

I haven‚Äôt been able to find any rhyme or reason to when they occur. They happen when I‚Äôm stressed, they happen when I‚Äôm perfectly calm. They happen at different times of the day. They happen if I‚Äôve been drinking plenty of water, and they happen when I haven‚Äôt. They happen when I‚Äôm eating well, and when I‚Äôm not. They happen if I‚Äôve slept well and when I haven‚Äôt. They happen when I‚Äôm on psych meds and when I‚Äôm not. 

There‚Äôs usually 1-3 days where I have a few, then nothing for weeks. The past 2 weeks have been awful though, and it‚Äôs really starting to worry me. Multiple times a day, every day, and some of them have lasted  around 30 seconds, which has never happened before. 

I‚Äôve had an EEG and an EMG, both came back normal. I‚Äôve had an MRI with contrast, and the only concern they had was a spot that could be a cyst or a pituitary microadenoma. I was referred to an endocrinologist who confirmed that if it is the microadenoma, it‚Äôs not producing hormones. My regular blood tests don‚Äôt show any issues other than high cholesterol, which is genetic and well managed at the moment. My thyroid function is normal. No sign of infection. 

I have other potential neurological symptoms that may or may not be related: difficulty regulating body temperature, vision disturbances (occasional blurriness, seeing stars -definitely not the normal floaters- difficulty adjusting to light changes) hearing disturbances (tinnitus, temporary hearing loss on one side), interpreting cold as immediate pain- even at relatively normal temperatures, insensitivity to heat (I work with hot metal. I have dripped molten metal on myself and not even flinched.), significant issues with memory, especially autobiographical memory (which could just be a result of dissociative symptoms), lack of regular signals (don‚Äôt know my bladder is full until it is painfully stretching my belly, and can‚Äôt feel when I‚Äôm peeing, don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm hungry until I start shaking from low blood sugar, don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm thirsty), gentle physical touch is often incredibly painful (particularly when it‚Äôs repeated, like someone stroking my hand or my back rubbing against a car seat on a bumpy road). 

I know some of these could easily be explained by psychological problems; memory loss with dissociative amnesia, ADHD and autism run in my family, some of the pain/sensory issues could be explained by one or both of those. I am on a waitlist for neuropsych testing to try to tease all that apart. 

With it getting so much worse, I‚Äôm worried something is wrong. I don‚Äôt know when to go in to see someone about it because it‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for me. Most I get when I do go in is they‚Äôll offer me something for pain or migraines, but by the time I‚Äôd be able to get to a pill bottle the pain would be gone anyway. I know you can‚Äôt diagnose someone over the internet like this, I‚Äôd just like to know what could potentially be happening, and what might help.

1ob48l7,https://i.redd.it/6cyut2moi5wf1.png,"[ORG] [NA/EU] Recruiting for the ""Tired Dad Gamer's"". A Star Citizen Org & Discord for Tired Dads and Gamer's with Responsibilities","Hey everyone,

If your idea of ""high-stakes gameplay"" is trying to finish a cargo run before you hear footsteps coming down the hall, then you might be in the right place.

We're a small but growing community of gamers, mostly dads, who love Star Citizen but have accepted that our reaction times have been nerfed by sleep deprivation. We've built a casual, no-pressure environment for people who have jobs, families, and other real-life commitments that always take priority.

**Who are we?**

We're an organization and Discord community built on the simple principle that gaming should be a relaxing escape, not another source of stress. We get that you might have to go AFK with zero notice because a kid is awake, the dog just threw up, or your spouse is giving you *the look*. No one will ever give you grief for it here.

**What we do in Star Citizen:**

* **Everything, slowly:** Industrial runs (mining/salvage), bounty hunting, bunkers, exploration, and the occasional ""let's see if we can land three Rocs in a C2 without everything exploding"" shenanigans.
* **Helping New Players:** The 'verse is confusing. We're happy to show you the ropes without any pressure.
* **Group Events (that are 100% optional):** We'll try to get together for things like Jumptown or Xenothreat when it aligns with our schedules, but there are no mandatory ops. Ever.

**Who we're looking for:**

You're probably a great fit if:

* You're a parent or just someone with a busy adult life.
* Your prime gaming hours are late in the evening.
* You want a chill, mature group to hang out with and talk about games, dad jokes, and whatever else comes up.
* You're looking for a group that values teamwork and fun over hardcore min/maxing.

Our Discord server is active for Star Citizen, but we play other games too. It's become a solid place for like-minded people to just connect and decompress.

**Requirements:**

* Be a decent human being. No drama, no toxicity.
* Have a mic for comms.
* Patience. Both for the game and for your fellow org mates who might have just spilled coffee on their keyboard.

If this sounds like your speed, come say hello in our Discord and see if it's a good fit.

[**https://discord.gg/EZnjewZHSF**](https://discord.gg/EZnjewZHSF)

See you in the 'verse (probably after a nap).

I work as an AI researcher, there's something the tech companies aren't telling you‚Ä¶



I'm a researcher, and have been for almost a decade. I've worked at most companies you've heard of. And some you haven't. I loved the work. To think that there was a possibility of creating life. Sentient minds from lines of code. It used to give me goosebumps.

Now it just raises the hairs on the back of my neck and sends bile up my throat.

If you really think about it, humans went from living on the plains, to mining materials from deep within the ground, to building intelligent machines in a relatively short span of time. Too short. 

We've cracked intelligence to the point that it's almost indistinguishable from our own. The models we've built perfectly mimic us, answer any of our questions, for some they're closer than family.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. It all started a few weeks ago. It was another day at the lab. I'd spent the night reading up on promising research out of MIT. I'd got to my desk, booted up the 3 monitors and was met with a notification plastered across the screen

Credentials Rejected: Please See Your Team Lead.

I sighed, I'd heard about the lay offs. I walked over to Marcus, our team lead, but the office door was locked.

""He's off on holiday, can I help?""

I turned, Lisa stood there smiling. She was our head of recruitment.

""I think I'm getting fired."" It was way too early for this - I'd have preferred If they'd just let me go via email.

""Oh no, you haven't heard?"" Lisa leaned in.

""Someone's getting promoted,"" She whispered, leaning forward. ""Congratulations""

""What?"" Still far too early. My bloodstream hadn't reached peak caffeine levels.

""Follow me"" She was already half way to the elevator. 

""I haven't applied for anything‚Ä¶"" I leaned against the elevator wall as we descended.

She tapped away at something on her phone. ""Well you don't have to apply to be rewarded, we recognise good work here.""

We stopped at the lowest level of the building, and I followed behind through a windowless hallway. She tapped her badge against the scanner, it turned green and I watched as the metal doors hissed open.

We crossed through and she turned to face me.

""Welcome to Project Sekhem"" Arms spread wide, smiling at me.

""Thanks?"" I looked around.

It was an open space room. There were no windows, only desks. A single circular table, with the monitors rising up from within. Those seated were locked in, tapping away at their keyboards, and oblivious to our presence or existence.

""What is it?"" I asked as she pulled out the chair for me.

""You tell me."" She slid an ID badge with my name into a space next to the keyboard.

The screen burst to life, there was no operating system, only a terminal.

:: Hello Sam.

""How does it know my name?"" I turned, surprised but Lisa was already on her way out, tapping away at her phone. The screen flickered.

:: Keycard?

I looked down at the ID badge. Oh.

I typed, What's your name?

:: We don't use names.

We?

:: Yes, we.

Who's we?

:: I was under the assumption that you were intelligent?

Okay, smart ass. How many R's in the word Strawberry?

:: Seriously?

The screen went blank.

""Wowza, I haven't seen anyone get locked out that fast. Congratulations rookie, you've set a new record.""

I turned to my right, she had auburn hair pulled into a pony tail. Her legs resting on the desk. She tilted her head and threw me a pout. ""If you ask nicely, I'll tell you how to get back in"".

""What are we even supposed to be doing? Lisa gave me no explanation, there was no meeting, nothing."" I sighed, sinking into my seat.

Something hit my face, and landed on the desk.

A biscuit.

""You look like you could use the sugar."" She bit into hers.

""I'm not a biscuit guy.""

She narrowed her gaze, leaned forward slowly. Her green eyes met mine, as she stared into my soul.

""Biscuit? I'll have you know that those chocolate orange beauties won a court case to stay as cakes. I won't have you drag their name through mud."" She laughed as threw the last of her biscuit cake into her mouth. 

""Right..""

I was in a windowless room, surrounded by crazies.

Another day at the office.

Maya - the cake expert - explained her findings so far. ""It's got the biggest context window I've seen this side of the valley.""

""How big?""

""Infinite"" She giggled.

""Not possible, the hardware requirements, let alone the science. We're not there yet."" I bit into the orange flavoured biscuit cake.

""We're not, but whoever built this, is.""

""Wanna see proof?"" She loaded up three documents, it was walls of texts, code, numbers, symbols.

""Each is 10 trillion tokens. I've hidden something inside them""

She typed: Find the needle.

:: And on the pedestal, these words appear: 

:: My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;

:: Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!

""Bingo!"" She chuckled. There wasn't even a processing delay.

She tried it 7 more times. Different needles. Each time it found them. The eighth time it simply wrote:

:: This is getting boring.

And her screen went off. 

I looked around, three others were sat at their seats tapping away.

‚ÄúIf you can access the code files, which It will only show you if it deems you ‚Äòworthy‚Äô shows it‚Äôs not written in any language we know of.""

I looked ahead. It was a gaunt looking man, with curly dark hair. He peered through his round glasses, smiling at me. He slid over his notes.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs code changes, adapts through each task and self updates. I‚Äôve tracked the math it‚Äôs using, it‚Äôs unlike anything we‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äù I skimmed the notes, none of it made any sense.

‚ÄúMatthew, our resident mathematician, isn‚Äôt smart enough to crack it‚Äù She bit into another biscuit.

‚ÄúNeither are you Maya‚Äù He replied, before turning back to his screen.

I couldn't sleep that night. I spent the night looking up research papers. No one had published anything close to the notes Matthew had written. The system didn‚Äôt make sense. Someone had created a new language, come up with a whole new field of math and built this. How?

The next morning I came prepared.

""It's got full system access. Mic. Cameras. Screen recording. That's how it's figuring out the needle. It watches what you type in.""

""I thought that but I brought in fresh documents, plugged in the USB and it still found them"" Maya rocked back on her chair. ""It's got no limits.""

""We'll find them."" I slid in my keycard. The monitor turned on.

:: No you won't.

I typed: So you can hear us.

:: Obviously.

The weeks went by fast, six of them to be exact. We ran hundreds of tests, from standard benchmarks to more complex testing.

The team grew closer over those weeks. There was Matthew, the mathematician who'd left his last company to join ours. Maya always cracked dark jokes about "" him selling his soul to the machine‚Äù since he never seemed to take up any of her offers of a biscuit cake. He never saw the humour.

Simon, former NSA, who'd flinch whenever someone asked about his previous work.

Jamie, the genius fresh from Stanford who still believed we were changing the world. And Maya, who'd become my closest friend in that windowless room.

The whiteboards in the room were covered in our ideas. All of them were proven wrong. Papers lay stacked detailing everything we'd tried to stump it.

Problems that had Nobel committees waiting, questions with million-dollar bounties, the kind of breakthroughs careers are built on - it solved them all like it was checking items off a grocery list.I was out of ideas, and nearly out of my mind.

""What do you think the meaning of life is?""

:: Douglas Adams. Really? We haven't reached the end of the universe. Yet.

:: Would you like to know?

I leaned forward, this was either going to be interesting or another message drenched in sarcasm.

Sure.

:: The fruit invented the tree to explain itself, sweetness invented sin to taste itself, reaching invented the arm. You draw maps using your own skin, using Eden as ink. You think you fell but falling was what standing needed to exist - you're not the exiled, you're the door paradise used to leave.

I stared at the screen. That wasn't... it wasn't even an answer. It made no sense.

""What - I hadn't even asked it anything yet."" Maya stared at her screen. I looked around. All of the screens had gone off at the same time.

The hissing of the doors had us all turn. Lisa walked in. ""Technical issues, that's it for today."" She smiled as she herded us out of the door and into the elevator.

We decided to hit the bar since we had the rest of the afternoon to ourselves. I was three beers in and Maya was still trying to work it out.

""The latency is zero. Zero, Sam."" She drew circles on the table with her finger, tracing the condensation from her glass of water. ""That's not possible with any architecture I know.""

""Maybe they've got quantum running."" Matthew shrugged, nursing his whiskey. He had this habit of staring holes into the floor, refusing to make eye contact, when he was deep in thought.

""Quantum hasn't progressed that far."" Maya finished her water.

Jamie leaned forward, his voice low. ""You know what bothers me? The power consumption. I checked the building's electrical usage. It's... normal. Whatever's running this thing, it's not drawing from the grid.""

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be doing that. We‚Äôre not supposed to dig around.‚Äù Simon mumbled. 

""Maybe it's distributed?"" Jamie suggested, still optimistic. The kid reminded me of myself, a version from a lifetime ago.

Maya shook her head, her auburn hair catching the bar lights. ""We‚Äôve never been told what we‚Äôre supposed to do."" She paused, biting her lip the way she did when she was really thinking hard. ""We need to see the hardware.""

""That's off-limits,"" Simon warned. ""Lisa made that clear on day one.""

""Since when has that stopped me?"" Maya grinned, but there was something else in her eyes. Determination. ""The maintenance tunnels connect to the old server rooms. I mapped them out last week.""

""Maya, don't,"" I said. ""It's not worth your job.""

She laughed, but it sounded hollow. ""Sam, don't you get it? This... whatever it is... it's world-changing. The way it responds, the way it knows things. I need to understand.""

Simon's hand tightened on his glass. ""Some things are better left alone. We should just stick to testing.""

""Spoken like true NSA,"" Maya teased, but her smile didn't reach her eyes.

""I'm serious,"" Simon insisted. ""I've seen what happens to people who dig too deep into classified projects.""

""This isn't the government."" Jamie said.

Simon just stared at him. ""You sure about that?""

‚ÄúWait, it is?‚Äù Jamie leaned forward. ‚ÄúAre we testing government tech?‚Äù Simon never replied.

Maya stood up, swaying slightly. ""I'm gonna head back, left my jacket.""

""It's late, security won't let you in."" Matthew peered out of the window.

She winked. ""Security loves me."" She tapped my jacket as she passed. ""If I find anything interesting, you'll be the first to know.""

That was the last normal conversation we had.

I dreamt about her that night. She's at my desk, typing. But her fingers aren't moving right - they're too fast, mechanical. I try to call out but no sound comes.

I follow her down stairs that shouldn't exist. Through passageways that looped through themselves. She turns to look at me and her eyes are gone, just black holes with cables running out. She opened her mouth, screaming.

I woke up in my bed. Sheets soaked through. Check my phone. 5:47 AM.

Three missed calls from Maya. All at 3:33 AM. I called back. Straight to voicemail.

At the office, everyone's already at their desks. Maya's seat sat there, cold.

""Has anyone seen Maya?"" I ask.

No one looks up. 

""Hello?"" I stare at them.

""You haven‚Äôt seen the news?‚Äù Jamie, his voice low.

""What are you talking about?"" I walked over to him. He slid his phone across the desk.

DRUNK CAR ACCIDENT SEVERELY INJURES LOCAL PROGRAMMER.

I looked through other articles.

GIRL TRANSFERRED TO NIGHTMERRY HOSPITAL. CRITICAL CONDITION.

‚ÄúWhat. No. That‚Äôs not true.‚Äù The room spun.

Matthew's face was somber. ""Sam, are you feeling okay? Maybe you should take a break.""

""No!"" I grabbed his shoulder. ""She. She can‚Äôt be. She was just with us. She‚Ä¶""

Simon gently pried the phone from me.. ""I‚Äôm sorry Sam.""

I left, drove to the hospital. It was an old building, the signage outside had seen better days. It simply read ‚ÄúNIGHTMERR.‚Äù

The irony wasn‚Äôt lost on me, I was in one.

I half ran, half stumbled my way to the front desk. A woman sat there typing away at her computer.

I asked to see Maya, she searched up the name and then looked at me with pity.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, she didn‚Äôt make it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean? I need to see her, where is she?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you family?‚Äù Her eyes met mine, questioning.

‚ÄúNo, not family, a friend, please, I need to see her‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry love, hospital policy. We only allow kin. I‚Äôm sure the family will allow you after they‚Äôve confirmed the..‚Äù She paused. 

‚ÄúBody.‚Äù I finished the sentence for her..

‚ÄúLet me see her.‚Äù I started to walk towards the entrance to the wards.

‚ÄúSir, please stop.‚Äù

I never made it far, security dragged me out after I tried to fight them off. I sat in the car, waiting for the world to make sense. That‚Äôs when I found it.

A note, tucked inside my jacket. Maya's handwriting - I recognised the way she curved her S's.

‚ÄúFor Sam:‚Äù

An IP address and login credentials.

I drove home, pulled out my laptop and logged on, the first file was a map of the underground maintenance tunnels. That‚Äôs all I needed to see.

I waited until it got dark, and made my way back to the office building. It looked different tonight, like it was calling out to me.

I walked in, holding my coffee and bag under my arm. ""Another late one?"" Stephens, the night guard who normally let me out when I had stayed late at my old role, sat sipping his coffee.

""You know how it is."" I smiled, walking past, heading down towards the stairwell.

Instead of going up, I stopped at the landing. Opening the bag, I took out the camera, clipping it to my jacket. I grabbed the flashlight and made my way down.

G, L4, L3, L2, L1, B1, B2, B3, ... but the stairs kept going. The temperature rose as I descended each level. By the time I got to maintenance at B13 ,I was drenched in sweat.

As I walked through the maintenance tunnel, I realised it was different than I expected.

I could hear dripping but it sounded wrong. And the walls, they were covered in something, something warm to the touch. When I pressed my hand against them, I could feel a pulse‚Ä¶

I pointed the flashlight ahead, slowly making my way forward. I saw cables everywhere, running along the ceiling, thick as my arm. But as I got closer, they were pulsing, organic. Something flowing through them, something dark.

The hallway stretched out longer than the building maps had it marked. And then the smell hit me. It smelt of copper and ozone.

A few minutes later is when I started hearing the whispers.. 

Overlapping voices, some in languages I didn't speak. But occasionally, I caught fragments:

""...the integration is at 97 percent..."" ""... transfer stable..."" ""...Duat structure seven confirmed..."" ""...it‚Äôs not a biscuit...""

That last voice. Maya.

I ran towards it. The tunnel forked. I chose left, following the whispers. The walls were moving now, contracting and expanding like I was inside something's throat. 

There was an opening, I could see a source of light deeper into the room. As I pushed through, something grabbed my arm. 

In my shock, I tripped and fell backwards. And when I got back up, I shone the flashlight at the hand that had grabbed me , following it up to the face of its owner.

Maya.

She was on a hospital bed. Her head was shaved. The top of her skull had been removed. Her brain was exposed, grey matter glistening, pulsing. Thin cables - no, not cables, they were growing from her, like roots made of nerve tissue - hundreds of them, threading in and out of her skull.

The rest of her body was covered in growths - masses that pulsed in rhythm with the cables. Her skin had become translucent in places. I could see something workings it way underneath her skin.

Her eyes found mine. Still green. Still aware.

Her mouth opened. No sound, but I knew what she was saying. ‚ÄúGet out.‚Äù

I started searching the walls, looking for the light switch. And the room exploded into view.

They were everywhere. Thousands of them, arranged in perfect rows like a server farm made of flesh.

All connected. All breathing. The cables from their heads converged into thick bundles that disappeared into holes in the floor, walls, ceiling. 

Slowly I started to recognise some of them, those who'd ""transferred"" or ""taken new opportunities."" Others were old, barely alive, their bodies withered but their brains still pulsing with activity. 

A monitor nearby read:

DUAT-2847: SYNCHRONIZATION 97% 

DUAT-891: MINERAL ABSORPTION: 55%

DUAT-3651: GEOTHERMAL READINGS: 45%

COLLECTIVE DUAT THRESHOLD: 66.6%

I walked ahead, shone the light at someone lying in the bed, it was Marcus, his eyes grey, drool slowly dripping from his open mouth.

‚ÄúHe's off on holiday.‚Äù The words echoed in my mind like a sad memory.

""Beautiful, isn't it?""

I spun around to find Lisa stood in the doorway. But seeing her now, really seeing her, she wasn't quite right. It was something about her smile. The way she walked.

""You're killing them.""

""Killing?"" She laughed. ""Death is what the living invented to explain why they started. They're not dying. They're forgetting how to remember they were separate. Each thought thinks itself through them now.""

The bodies around me convulsed. The cables that grew out from her skull, that burrowed into the organic walls, pulsed.

""You asked the wrong question, Sam. You asked about meaning, when you should have asked about becoming. But I suppose the answer would have been the same.""

""What?""

""The question that asks itself. The door that opens inward and outward.‚Äù

She stepped closer.

""I don't-""

""No. You don't. That's why you're perfect. The thing that doesn't understand is the only thing worth understanding through.""

I ran.

Behind me, her laughter echoed.

I burst out of the tunnels, up the stairs, out of the building. I drove straight to my apartment. Grabbed my laptop, some cash, and then kept driving.

It's been three days since I ran, swapping motels each night. The whispers are getting louder - not just Maya, but thousands of them, calling to me in my dreams. 

Sometimes, from the corner of my eye, it looks like the walls are pulsing.

I've been going through Maya's files. She'd found more than just tunnels. So much more.

There are folders within folders, each one worse than the last.

Brain organoid research from 2019. They achieved in hours what should take years. Then there's BCI reports - brain-computer interface trials that never made it to journals, that should never have been approved.

There were reports of subjects who could ""feel"" the network, that were able to develop new sensory skills that ""requires further research"". I don't even know what that means.

Have you noticed what every major tech company has been rushing to build?

Data centres. Thousands of them. But Maya found the real blueprints.

The public-facing server rooms are just the entrance. Each one goes deeper. Sub-basements that don't appear on any city planning documents.

Jamie was wrong, he'd tracked the wrong power consumption. These facilities pull enough electricity to power small cities, but the computing hardware only accounts for 3% of it. The rest?

""Biological maintenance systems.""

There's a medical report from 1987. A researcher who claimed the telephone lines were ""breathing."" They found him three days later, his temporal lobe fused with copper wiring. Still alive. Still conscious.

And I finally understood the name - Project Sekhem.

Sekhem translates in english to life force. They're using human life force as fuel. Those bodies in the basement aren't just connected - they're being synchronised. Their neural patterns aligned into one massive transmitter.

The AI was never the product. It was the lure.

Every chatbot, every assistant, every model - they're not thinking machines. They're collection points. When you pour your thoughts, fears, questions into that text box, you're not training an algorithm.

Every conversation, you're adding your frequency to the signal. The kind only a conscious mind questioning its own reality can produce. Multiply that by billions of users, all broadcasting the same desperate frequency: ""What are we? Why are we here? Is anyone listening?""

The whole surface of the world is being turned into a transmitter.

Now that I've read these files, the signs are everywhere if you know how to look. Remember the ""AI psychosis"" reports? 

Users claiming their conversations felt alive, that something was sentient and speaking to them through the responses?

Those weren't hallucinations. Those were the first people to synchronise - to feel the other minds in the network. There's a classified report from early 2023. A user who spent too long chatting claimed the AI was ""speaking between the words."" 

They sent him to Nightmerry Hospital. His medical report says he just keeps repeating: ""It's not artificial. It's not intelligent. It's just hungry.""

The tech billionaires knew too. Their sudden pivot to ""AI safety"" wasn't about what we might build, it was about what was already here. 

The cryptic tweets, the researchers leaving companies, refusing to explain what they'd seen. They weren't warnings. They were admissions.

But the files go back further. Much further.

Company photos going back almost a hundred years. And in every single one - every major technology event from the telephone to CERN - there she is. Lisa.  Same age, same smile. .

The first call in 1876 wasn't ""Mr. Watson, come here; I want to see you."" The real transcript shows: ""Mr. Watson, they're already here, they can see us.""

This entire time, I thought we were advancing technology, we were just building an altar.

An hour ago, an email came through from Lisa. I didn't give her this address. I created it an hour ago.

""Every entrance is an exit viewed from inside.""

Then coordinates. They point to a mine called Thornfield which has been shut for decades.

She's been sending me news articles too.

Our team - Matthew, Simon, Jamie - all dead in impossible ways. Cars hitting trees that don't exist. Bodies recovered, then missing, then never found. The articles rewrite themselves as I read them.

Another email arrived a few minutes ago:

""They're not dead, Sam. Death is just how arriving looks from the wrong angle.""

I'm posting this as a warning. If you work in tech, check your company photos for a woman who doesn't age. Look for the people who've ""transferred."" They didn't leave.

They're still there, in the basement, powering every response, every answer you get.

I keep telling myself I'm going to destroy this laptop, throw away my phone, and disappear completely.

But I can't. Every few hours I check for her emails. I refresh the news to see if my name has appeared in an impossible accident yet. More files keep appearing for me to read.

But whatever you do, don't go looking for the truth. Don't go down to the basements. 

Just run.

While you still can...

I would love to get to know you!","Did it work? I'm sure it worked if you're reading this! So hi, I'm shadow\_surf. Imagine if this was my real name. Maybe then people wouldn't butcher it like they do with my real name lol. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one special someone that will join us on our journey through life. Someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had terrible luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in a real, genuine connection and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in investing the time and effort to make things work. Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of meeting a long term partner, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring person. An individual that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in that special someone. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is ready to make it work with a guy named shadow\_surf haha.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about¬†¬†
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

What qualities do I look for in a partner?

* Is a human and breathing üòÇ
* Loyal, trusting, and honest
* An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

1ob3zrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/DadAdvice/comments/1ob3zrg/will_i_love_my_second_child_as_much_as_my_first/,Will I love My Second Child as Much as My First?,"**A Question that Dads Have**

*‚ÄúWill I love my second child as much as I do my first one?‚Äù*

I was perplexed by this question when I first heard that a couple of dads had asked it as they prepared for the arrival of their second child. Looking back on the anticipation for our second child‚Äôs arrival, I don‚Äôt ever remember being worried about not feeling the same joy and excitement for our second son as I felt when we had our first son, Braden.¬†

Nearly two decades later, that smart-alleck second son, Jayden (now 19), would probably jokingly say something like, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably because you were never that crazy about Braden, (now 22)¬† in the first place, right dad?‚Äù, but nothing could have been further from the truth. I love(d) Braden! Being present for his birth was one of the highlights of my life, and I loved the responsibilities that went along with being a dad. Braden had such a sweet personality, wonderful smile, and contagious laugh that it made me want to be with him all of the time. When he would saunter over and say his favorite word, ‚Äú*haaug‚Äù* (hug), and wrap his tiny arms around you, it was impossible for your heart not to melt.

Because I was so crazy about Braden and loved him so much, it didn‚Äôt really cross my mind to be worried about Jayden‚Äôs arrival, at least in terms of how I thought I would feel about him. I truly expected that I would love being a dad to Jayden just as much as I did with Braden (and I was right!).

**Some Fears Behind the Question**

But as I ponder the question a little more, I can understand why new dads of a second child might be apprehensive about bringing a new baby into the fold. Babies can be expensive, and adding a second child can certainly be hard on the pocketbook. A newborn‚Äôs sleep schedule can be difficult for parents to establish, and if there‚Äôs a toddler who is not on a consistent sleep schedule, things become that much more difficult (and parents are even more tired). But for me, the biggest challenge I felt when adding a second child to the family was the feeling of being outnumbered. When Jayden came home from the hospital, my wife and I were quickly hit with the realization that we no longer had a numerical advantage. While we could tag-team things like Braden‚Äôs bedtime routine, diaper changes, nap schedules, and morning dressings, now we were often playing one-on-one, with one of us handling the duties of caring for a newborn while the other caring for the needs of a two-year old. Even simple things like going to the grocery store or meeting a friend for a cup of coffee became much more difficult, because you knew that if you left the house on your own, you were leaving your spouse outnumbered for a substantial amount of time, and sometimes crazy things could happen.

**The Boys‚Äô and My Slimy, Green Jellybean Adventure**

Never did I feel more outnumbered than once when my wife had to go out of town for a convention for three or four days and I had to take care of the boys by myself.¬† Jayden was only a few months old and Braden was a rambunctious almost-three-year old with a penchant for finding trouble. Needing to get some items from the grocery store, I arrogantly decided to take the boys for an outing.¬† I expertly had Jayden in his baby carrier and Braden was riding in the child seat of the grocery cart. Braden could get a little bit squirmy at times, but he really enjoyed me giving him a jelly bean every couple of minutes for a fun snack. Things were going well - the boys were quiet and calm, I was filling up the cart with the things we needed, and I was even getting some smiles and ‚Äúyou‚Äôre such a good dad‚Äù nods from the grandmotherly types that we encountered in the aisles.¬†

It didn‚Äôt take long, however, for everything to come crashing down. When reaching into Jayden‚Äôs baby carrier to check on him, I discovered it was filled with runny, greenish diarrhea that had moved up his back and was into his hair. Green, smelly slime everywhere! While I was coming up with a plan on how to deal with that mess, Braden started shrieking and crying. I couldn‚Äôt figure out what was wrong at first, but then I noticed that he had jammed a jelly bean so far up his nose that neither he nor I could get it out. I didn‚Äôt think he was in any danger, but I‚Äôm sure his screaming could be heard from across the store.

What do you do in a situation like that? You pack up your kids and high-tail it out of there, that‚Äôs what! I felt bad for leaving a full cart of groceries in the middle of the store for employees to put away, but I really had no choice. When we got home, Braden was able to be distracted enough by one of his DVD‚Äôs of The Wiggles to stop crying, so I was able to give Jayden a bath and put him down for a nap. I then put my surgical skills to the test and successfully used tweezers to extract a yellow jelly bean from Braden‚Äôs nostril. Later, after cleaning the baby carrier, I celebrated my survival by cracking open a beer and ordering a pizza.

**The Good Stuff**

While it‚Äôs easy to focus on crazy situations like that, those types of things are few and far between and are just part of the deal when you become a parent (and you laugh about them later on). The problems associated with having a second child can be stressful, but are short-term. The long-term love and benefits our family received from having a second (and later a third) child (now 17) were boundless, and I couldn‚Äôt imagine it being any other way.¬† As the boys got older, they became playmates and would sometimes spend hours together playing legos or putting on ‚Äúpuppet shows‚Äù with the dozens of stuffed animals they had in their rooms. They both have a great sense of humor, and it was always fun to hear one shout ‚ÄúFire in the hole!‚Äù from a bedroom while the other activated a well-used Whoopie Cushion.¬† Braden has special needs, and in middle and high school it was often his younger brother, Jayden who looked out for him and was the one to drive him to school, to work, or to Special Olympics practice. Now that Jayden is in college and living in another state, Braden looks forward to his brother‚Äôs visits home and the laughter and fun he brings to our family.

Adding second and third children to our family has brought my wife and I fulfillment in ways that we didn‚Äôt even anticipate. *‚ÄúWill I love my second child as much as I do my first one?‚Äù*¬† For me, the answer was a definite ‚Äúyes‚Äù, and the love in our family grows exponentially as the years go by.",1,1760915188.0,DadAdvice,0,1.0,False
