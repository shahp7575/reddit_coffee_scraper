My couch was lost by the movers, so reserve (some) judgement. Or don't, lol. 

Still up in the air: Artwork, Coffee Table ... I'm not locked in on the artwork, as I had it originally in mind for another room but kinda like it there. Was looking for some tall sculptural piece to give some vertical interest to the 11 ft wall. Also, I like the tone of the chonky coffee table, but am looking for something with more interest and more feminine lines to contrast the roundness in the couch, end table and lamp. I found a marble table in a deep red w/ cream/ivory veining that was gorgeous, but didn't add to the overall space and was too busy.

1mh4bk5,https://i.redd.it/3054n9bdnxgf1.jpeg,I’m a CS student and I built a mathematical betting bot as a coding project - now my whole tutorial group uses it,"I'm writing this because I can't sleep.

Not because I'm stressed about money for once in my uni life, but because I'm genuinely buzzing about what I discovered.

A few months ago I was the classic broke uni student. You know the type, surviving on Mi Goreng, dodging rent conversations with my housemates, and genuinely considering selling my PlayStation just to make it through the semester.

My parents kept asking when I'd get a ""proper job,"" but between my engineering degree and trying to maintain some semblance of a social life, I barely had time to breathe, let alone work retail shifts that paid peanuts.

That all changed because of the most random discovery I've ever made.

And honestly? I almost didn't tell anyone about this because it sounds too good to be true. But after seeing what it's done for me and a bunch of other students, I figure some of you might want to know.

**The Night Everything Changed**

It was a random Tuesday night. I was procrastinating on a thermodynamics assignment (classic me) and scrolling through Reddit when I stumbled into this thread about some guy who'd paid off his student debt through something called ""sports arbitrage.""

I'd never placed a bet in my life. Sport wasn't really my thing, I'm more of a Netflix and takeaway kind of guy. But this thread was talking about making money from sports betting without actually caring who wins.

Wait, what?

I went down the deepest rabbit hole of my life.

Turns out there's this thing where betting companies (Sportsbet, TAB, Ladbrokes, companies I'd heard of but never really thought about) sometimes disagree on who's going to win a game. For example, one company might think Team A has a 60% chance of winning, while another thinks they only have a 55% chance.

When that happens, if you're smart about it, you can bet on both outcomes and guarantee yourself a profit no matter what happens.

It's called arbitrage, and apparently Wall Street traders have been doing it with stocks for decades.

But here's the kicker, most people don't know about it because the betting companies obviously don't advertise it, and it's hidden behind all this complicated math that makes your head spin.

My First Taste of ""Free Money""

I stayed up way too late that night reading everything I could find.

The next day, instead of going to my morning lecture (sorry, Professor Williams), I decided to test this theory with the $50 I had left in my account after paying for groceries.

I downloaded three different betting apps, found a tennis match where the numbers lined up, and placed two small bets.

When the match finished, I had $57.

I made $7 without caring who won the tennis match, without knowing anything about tennis, and without any chance of losing money.

My mind was blown.

It felt like I'd discovered a glitch in the matrix.

The Problem I Quickly Discovered

Over the next few weeks, I became obsessed with finding these opportunities.

I'd sit in the library between classes with my laptop and phone, frantically checking odds across different apps, using my calculator to figure out if the math worked out.

Some days I'd make decent money. Other days there is barely anything.

But here's what nearly broke me: these opportunities disappear FAST. Like, you'd find one, spend ages calculating everything, and by the time you went to place the bet, someone else had already taken advantage of it and the odds had changed.

I was spending hours a day hunting for these opportunities and only catching a few.

It was like trying to catch butterflies with a broken net.

Plus, I was falling behind in my actual studies. My mates started asking why I was always glued to my phone, and I couldn't exactly explain that I was trying to outsmart billion-dollar companies with a calculator app.

The Lightbulb Moment

Then it hit me during a particularly boring programming lecture.

If I could write code to automate my assignments, why couldn't I write code to automate this?

I'm a second-year computer science student. I've built chatbots, automated Instagram followers, even created a script that automatically enrolls me in classes during enrollment period.

This was just another automation problem.

Building the Solution

I spent the next few weeks basically living in the computer labs.

I built a program that does what I was doing manually, but way faster:

It continuously monitors odds across all the major betting sites, instantly calculates when profitable opportunities appear, and sends me a notification with exactly how much to bet and where.

No more manual checking. No more calculations. No more missed opportunities.

I called it Mathsbet because that's literally all it is, pure math, no gambling involved.

The first week I ran it properly, I made good money from a small starting amount.

The second week, even better.

Within a few weeks, I was making solid daily income just from checking my phone when it buzzed and placing the bets it recommended.

When My Mates Found Out

I managed to keep it quiet for about a month.

But then Jake, my housemate, noticed I'd stopped complaining about being broke and had actually paid rent early for once.

""Dude, did your parents finally cave and give you more money?"" he asked while we were making dinner.

I showed him Mathsbet.

His reaction was exactly what mine had been: complete disbelief, followed by ""Holy shit, this is actually real.""

Jake started using it that weekend. Then he told our other housemate Amy. Amy told her boyfriend.

Word spread pretty quickly through our friend group and tutorial classes. I ended up letting most of the people in my engineering cohort use it, plus some mates from other courses.

And here's the crazy part.. It worked for everyone.

Emma from my tutorial went from living on pasta to being able to afford groceries without checking her bank balance first.

David, who was seriously considering dropping out because of financial pressure, stayed in his degree and is now less stressed than I've ever seen him.

These aren't gambling addicts or sports fanatics. These are just normal students who found a way to make the math work in their favor for once.

Why This Works When Everything Else Doesn't

Here's what I learned about why most people struggle with money in uni, and why this is different:

Traditional part-time jobs pay maybe $20-25 an hour, but you need to sacrifice study time, social life, and often your mental health to make decent money.

Side hustles like dropshipping or crypto trading require either upfront capital you don't have or expertise that takes months to develop.

But this? This requires no expertise, no large upfront investment, and takes maybe minutes per day total.

You're not competing with anyone. You're not trying to predict anything. You're just taking advantage of basic math discrepancies that exist because these companies operate independently.

It's like if two shops were selling the same item for different prices, and you could buy from the cheap one and immediately sell to the expensive one for a guaranteed profit.

The Results After a Few Months

I'm not going to lie and say I'm rich now.

But I've gone from genuinely stressed about money every single day to having a steady side income that covers all my living expenses and then some.

I'm consistently making decent money each month. Nothing crazy, but enough to completely change my financial situation.

More importantly, I sleep better. I don't check my bank balance with anxiety anymore. I can go out with friends without calculating whether I can afford an Uber home.

And I'm not the only one. Everyone in my class who's tried this has similar stories.

Why I'm Sharing This Now

Honestly, part of me didn't want to share this publicly.

The more people who know about it, the fewer opportunities there might be for everyone.

But then I realized, there are thousands of students struggling financially right now, and most of them have no idea this is even possible.

The betting companies make billions of dollars from people who don't understand math. Maybe it's time some of that money went back to students who actually need it.

Plus, I've seen how much this changes people's lives. Not just financially, but the stress relief and confidence that comes from finally having some control over your financial situation.

The Reality of Running This Thing

Here's the thing though - after letting my classmates use this for free for a while, I realized I had a problem.

Running Mathsbet isn't as simple as just letting it sit on my laptop. To work properly, it needs to run 24/7 on powerful cloud servers that can handle scanning dozens of betting sites simultaneously, processing thousands of odds changes per minute, and sending instant notifications to everyone using it.

The server costs alone were killing me. We're talking about high-performance computing instances that cost hundreds per month, plus database hosting, API fees from all the different betting sites, and the bandwidth to handle real-time data for multiple users.

I was spending more on keeping this thing running than I was making from it.

So I had to make a tough choice: either shut it down completely, or start charging enough to cover the costs and maybe make it sustainable.

I decided to keep it running, but I had to start charging $100 per month to use it. I know that sounds like a lot for a student budget, but when you break it down - that's less than most people spend on coffee in a month, and this actually makes you money instead of just keeping you awake.

Plus, I offer a full week free trial so you can test it out and see if it works for you before committing anything.

What Happens Next

If you're reading this and thinking ""this sounds too good to be true,"" I get it.

A few months ago, I would have thought the same thing.

But sometimes you stumble across something that's hiding in plain sight, and it changes everything.

I've put together a way for other students to try Mathsbet with a full week free trial, so you can see if it works for you before spending anything.

After that, it's $100 per month - which I know sounds steep, but it's honestly just enough to cover the server costs and keep this thing running reliably. Most people make that back in their first few days anyway.

It's not going to make you rich overnight, and it's not gambling, it's just math working in your favor for once.

If you're tired of being stressed about money, tired of choosing between textbooks and groceries, and ready to try something that actually works, then maybe it's worth checking out.

1mh47xq,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mh47xq/ro_aria/,[RO] Aria,"Part 1 – The Day They Met

Elias had long ago learned how to sound like the man with the answers. Friends came to him when they didn’t know what to do next, cousins called for advice on degrees or jobs, even people he barely knew seemed to trust that he’d know the way forward. He would listen, pause just long enough to look thoughtful, then give them something calm and certain.

The truth was, he rarely felt certain. He was guessing most of the time. But no one could tell.

She was sitting by the window when he first noticed her, half in sunlight, still in a way that felt deliberate. Not shy — just… self-contained. Her hair caught the light when she tilted her head to write something down. She was beautiful in a way that made him forget whatever he’d been thinking about before.

He spoke to her after class, making up a question about the professor’s example. Her answers were short, polite, the kind that would have ended the exchange if he’d let them. But he didn’t. He asked another, and another. A shift happened — the smallest softening in her expression, the faintest curve of a smile. He left the conversation feeling like he’d just been allowed into a place not many people saw.

A week later, they met coincidentally at a bus stop. The sun was high, the pavement giving off heat. She was reading, and he asked about the book. She glanced up, amused, and asked why he always had a pen behind his ear. He told her it was habit — “You never know when something worth remembering will come up.”

The conversation wandered — childhood memories, the best food they’d ever had, the places they wanted to see. Then, somewhere in the middle of it, she tilted her head and asked, “What’s your purpose in life?”

He paused, caught off guard by the bluntness. “To leave a legacy,” he said finally. “To make something that lasts beyond me. I want to know I’ve built something people will remember.”

She nodded slowly, considering him. “For me, it’s the present,” she said. “I think things matter in the moment they exist. That’s all.”

“If nothing lasts,” he asked, “why try at all?”

“Because you’re here now,” she said. “That’s the only time you get for sure.” She smiled, then added, almost as an afterthought, “My purpose is just to live every day happily. That’s it.”

The bus came. Neither of them moved. The air shifted from heat to cool as the sun dipped lower, shadows stretching long across the street. By the time the streetlights flickered on, it felt like they’d stepped into a conversation they might still be having years from now.

Part 2 – The Birthday

Elias had been building the day for months without telling her. Every plan was tucked away in his head, a quiet collection of details gathered from stray comments she’d made. The park she once called “the most peaceful place in the city.” The dance class she’d said she’d try “one day, maybe.” The restaurant she’d mentioned offhand while scrolling her phone — a place she thought was “way too fancy” for her to actually go to.

He woke before she did, ran through the itinerary in his head. The timings worked. The gaps were small enough to keep momentum, long enough to let her enjoy each thing.

When they set out for the park, the air was crisp and clean. She kept slowing to look at flowers or pause at a particularly tall tree, and he let her, though he was aware of the minutes ticking by. The dance class was next, and the instructor was already expecting them.

She noticed how he kept checking the time, even while holding her hand. It wasn’t intrusive — just a flick of his eyes, a subtle shift of his weight — but it was there. She didn’t say anything. The morning was too pretty, and his effort was so clear.

The dance class was small, six couples in a mirrored room. He stumbled once, twice, muttered something under his breath, but she laughed each time and pulled him along. She thought about how much she loved seeing him in this unfamiliar setting, letting himself look a little silly.

By the time they arrived at the restaurant, the city lights had come on. He led her through the doors, and her breath caught. The same soft gold lighting she’d seen in pictures. The same curved banquettes. She turned to him, and he was already watching her reaction.

“It’s perfect,” she said, and she meant it.

But over dinner, she caught him doing it again — eyes flicking to the clock on the wall, adjusting his posture as if mentally checking something off. She knew it was his way of caring, of making sure the night went smoothly. Still, a part of her wished he would just… stop. Let the moment be messy if it wanted to be.

She smiled and reached for his hand across the table. He smiled back, but in the back of her mind, she wondered if she’d ever be able to make him forget what time it was.

Part 3 – The First Trip

Before they left, Elias had said, “I’ll handle everything — flights, hotel, activities, all of it. You just have to take care of dinner.”
It was said with a smile, a gentle bargain. He loved the planning; she loved the eating. It made sense.

The first morning in the mountain town was perfect. Sunlight poured over snow-dusted rooftops, catching in the frost on the window. Downstairs, the smell of breakfast wrapped around them — fresh pastries still warm, bowls of jewel-bright fruit, coffee rich enough to leave a lingering heat in the chest. They ate by the wide glass windows, watching skiers carve graceful lines into the slopes below.

Elias’s careful preparation meant no waiting in line for ski passes. They went straight to the lifts, the air sharp and cold as they rose higher into the mountains. From the top, the view was staggering — white peaks rolling into the horizon, and a light, gentle slope winding into a narrow run flanked by tall pines.

It was the kind of path that felt like a secret. Sunlight slipped through the branches, scattering across the snow in shifting patterns. Every turn pressed itself into her memory — a picture she knew she would keep for life.

Halfway down, she lost control and crashed into another beginner, flipping him right over her in a tangle of limbs and skis. Laughter spilled into the air. Elias skidded to a stop beside her, helping her up with a grin — pretending, of course, that he hadn’t quietly fallen on his own butt more than a few times earlier that day.

By evening, after hours on the slopes, they wandered into town. Lanterns glowed above the narrow streets, each doorway spilling warmth and the scent of food into the cold air.

“So,” Elias said, “which restaurant are we going to tonight?”

She grinned. “Let’s just head down this street and see what’s good!”

His face fell, just a little. “Wait — you didn’t plan ahead? Like, check online which ones are worth going to?”

She shook her head, still cheerful. “No, I thought we’d just walk and see what’s good.”

“What’s good?” he asked, as though the phrase itself needed proof.

She pointed toward a small place with wood-framed windows and a golden glow inside. “That one looks yummy.”

He looked at the queue. “So how long do you think we’d have to wait for that? You see the people in line? Mostly tourists. All those young folks just looking to get Instagrammable pics. How do you know the food is actually good?”

She laughed at first, but the questions kept coming — portion sizes, prices, whether the locals actually ate there. It stopped feeling like a walk through a charming street and started feeling like a test. The one thing she’d been responsible for on this trip, and now she wasn’t sure she’d pass.

They ended up in a different restaurant he picked. Dinner was fine — maybe even great — but she found herself quieter than usual, watching the people outside more than talking.

Later, in the hotel, he asked, “Did you not like the food?”

“It was fine,” she said softly. “I just… sometimes I don’t want to think that much. I just want to walk with you and go where it feels right.”

He didn’t answer right away. To him, love meant making sure they had the best possible experience. To her, love was being there together, even if it wasn’t perfect.

Part 4 – The Year Apart 

The trip to the mountains became one of those memories that glowed in Aria’s mind — the tree-lined slope, the crash into another skier, the laughter. And yes, the restaurant night too — not because of the food, but because of the way his questions had made her feel like she was under a spotlight she hadn’t asked for.

It wasn’t a fight. Just a moment.
But there were others.

Elias saw them as small differences in style. She saw them as tiny weights, slowly collecting. When they went for a walk, she liked to drift, stopping at whatever caught her eye. He would watch the clock, thinking about the next stop. When she suggested a weekend away, she imagined pointing to a spot on the map and just going. He wanted to research, compare, plan.

Neither spoke of it as a problem. And when the offer came for her to go abroad — a one-year placement — Elias encouraged her. “Go,” he said. “Have your adventure. I’ll be here when you get back.”

For the first few months, they called often. She told him about the markets, the late nights, the random street cafés she’d stumbled into without even knowing their names. He told her about his projects, the new skills he was learning, the places he’d found for them to visit when she came back.

But as the months passed, their conversations thinned. Hers were full of people he’d never met, places she couldn’t fully describe because “you have to be here.” She was always busy. Always out.

When the year was nearly over, he started counting down the days. Then one evening, her voice on the phone was different.

“I don’t think I want to come back,” she said.

The silence stretched. “What?”

“I just… I’m happy here.”

His pulse thudded in his ears. “So that’s it? After everything — I waited for you. I planned our future. I—” He broke off, swallowing. “What’s wrong with me, Aria? Just tell me. I can fix it.”

She was quiet. “It’s not that you did something wrong.”

“Then what? You’re being fickle, running away instead of working things out. We could make it better. Whatever’s wrong, we can fix it together.”

“I don’t know what’s wrong,” she said at last. “You were always right, Elias. About the plans. About what made sense. But I felt… stifled. Like there was only one right way to do things, and it was always yours. And I don’t want to go back to feeling like I’m always wrong. Always not good enough. Always being cared for, but never really… equal. Like I’m being tolerated instead of celebrated.”

He pressed his hand to his forehead. “So all this time—”

“I didn’t even see it myself until I came here. I make my own decisions now. They’re not always the best ones, but they’re mine. And I’m happy with them. I just don’t want to go back to feeling like I can’t breathe.”

Her words sat between them, sharp and final. He wanted to argue, to convince her she was wrong, that what they had was worth fighting for. But beneath his anger was something heavier — the sinking knowledge that her mind was already made up.

Part 5 – The Hollow Year 

After the call, Elias sat in the dark, the phone still in his hand.
Her words ran circles in his head, looping, cutting deeper each time.

I don’t want to go back to feeling like I’m always wrong. Always not good enough. Always being cared for, but never really equal. Like I’m being tolerated instead of celebrated.

He had waited for her without hesitation. Turned down work that would’ve kept him away when she came back. Set money aside for the trips they’d talked about. Saved little moments — songs, recipes, places — to share with her when she returned. His whole year had been shaped around her return.

And now… what was it all for?

He’d asked her what was wrong with him, ready to fix it. She’d said it wasn’t that he’d done something wrong. But what was he supposed to do with that? How could he fight for something if there was no list to work through, no problem to solve?

He thought about the little frictions — the restaurant in the ski town, the walks where she wandered off-course while he checked the time, the weekends where she wanted to “just see” and he wanted to know exactly what came next. He hadn’t thought of those as cracks. He’d thought of them as shortcomings he was helping her improve on. She didn’t plan ahead? He could teach her. She didn’t like comparing options? He could make the choices for her. To him, that was love — filling in each other’s gaps.

It never crossed his mind that what he saw as help, she might have felt as correction.

He’d wanted to give her security. She wanted freedom. He didn’t know how to be both.

Some nights, he walked just to be moving. The city blurred around him — neon signs, traffic, the smell of food from late-night stalls. He wondered if she was walking somewhere too, in the cool air of her new life, laughing at something he’d never hear about.

The hardest part wasn’t the distance. It wasn’t even losing her.
It was the quiet, gnawing ache of realizing he had waited faithfully, with his whole heart, for someone who had decided — long before she told him — that she wasn’t coming back.

And still, despite everything, part of him kept listening for her voice in the spaces between thoughts.",1,1754282450.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I’ve been doing my head in reading all the different posts and forums. 

I’m looking to upgrade my grinder (currently using BBE) to enhance my at-home coffee experience. I drink only milk drinks (flat whites /200ml) and have been really enjoying light/medium roasts with fruity notes (like those found in Ethiopian blends). 

My current research has brought me to looking for a grinder with flat burrs, which lead me to the Lagom P64 (happy to pay the price of an upgrade if I can consistently get an enjoyable fruity/floral flat whites).

I have two questions:

1) For my flavour profile and drink of choice, what are the recommended burrs? 

2) Is there really a clear difference in taste and consistency by upgrading just the grinder? 

Then there are the questions on seasoning the grinder and dialling in. But I’ll leave that for another post.

About me: I’m known to be fun, especially if you’re the calm and fun type too. I’m well-educated, soft-spoken, and generally considered a nice guy. Not tall, but fit—I run a lot. I’d say I’m fairly good-looking and happy to share a photo. I enjoy reading, watching YouTube, and being outdoors—hiking and weekend walks are my thing. I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don’t drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

All ages, races, locations, time zones, and relationship statuses are welcome to message me. I just ask that you’re respectful and genuinely want to chat.

Hi. I’m the guy your therapist warned you about. The one who wants deep conversations, deeper connections, and maybe your legs over my shoulders. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves — first, you gotta qualify.

If you’re a brilliant, beautiful mess with a few unresolved issues and a strong jawline, read on. Here’s your guide to winning me over (and possibly ruining me in the best way possible).

1. Daddy Issues? Say Less.
If your relationship with your father resembles a deleted scene from a dark HBO drama — I’m listening. I like my women complex, mysterious, and just the right amount of unhinged. You’ve got trust issues? Great. That means I get to earn it. Slowly. Shirtless.

And if you whisper “you make me feel safe” while wearing my t-shirt, I’ll probably fall in love. Or at least ruin my week thinking about you.

2. Got an Oral Fixation? Welcome Home.
You bite your lip when you’re thinking. You chew on your pen like it owes you money. You talk with purpose, kiss with intention, and eat strawberries like it’s foreplay.

Perfect. I want a woman who can use her mouth for stimulating conversation and other... stimulating things. Let’s have a debate over coffee and make out like teenagers in the car after.

3. Be Clingy – Like, Duct Tape-Clingy
I don’t want a “chill” girl who disappears for three days and calls it “self-care.” I want you all up in my space. I want morning texts, forehead kisses, possessive glances, and that “I’m slightly obsessed with you but in a hot way” energy.

Be my emotional support vampire. Suck the life out of me — affectionately.

4. Intelligence Turns Me On (Literally)
If you can whisper Descartes quotes while unbuttoning your shirt, I’ll propose. I’m not just into looks (though yes, please be hot), I need someone who can challenge me. Tease me with your wit. Talk nerdy to me.

You’ve got opinions, theories, maybe a weird obsession with Greek mythology or trauma psychology? Good. Let’s unpack it. Then make out on the floor.

5. Banter Me Into Bed
I need more than just sex. I want laughs so hard you snort. Eye contact that’s borderline illegal. Flirty insults. Late-night convos that start with “So what’s your biggest fear?” and end with “Can I sleep over?”

Match my sarcasm. Match my energy. Match my mouth — tongue for tongue, word for word.

Final Thoughts (Before You Slide In My DMs)
Be wild. Be weird. Be smart. Be the type of woman that kisses like a poet and argues like a lawyer. If you’re beautiful, brilliant, and just slightly dangerous to my emotional stability — you might just be the one.

Let’s talk. Let’s flirt. Let’s make bad decisions that feel really, really good.",1,1754281440.0,u_A_M_E_S_,0,1.0,False

Like my aunt who always asks, “When are you getting married?” or “Don’t you have a boyfriend already?” Then my uncle goes, “I saw her at a coffee shop talking to some guy.”

I mean, family gatherings are rare, and yet the conversations always feel off. Stuff like, “You’re not a kid anymore,” or just random comments that don’t feel nice. I’m not even sure if the gathering is about bonding or showing off.

That one time, after my uncle and aunt started calling me out, my mom ended up pointing something out about my cousin too. My cousin and I looked at each other, we’re super close, and it felt weird. Shouldn’t they be the reason why we’re close as a family? But it’s like they want to cause a cold war between us cousins.

So we all slowly left the table and just talked by the bonfire. And now that kind of thing happens a lot. Some cousins even make excuses just to skip gatherings, saying they’re “busy,” but really, they’re just tired of being the topic.

Funny enough, we actually enjoy each other’s company more when the older ones aren’t around. We go on beach trips, hang out, and honestly, we’re happier that way. But still, we don’t understand them. Every time we cousins meet, we end up talking about how draining it all is.

I’ll cut to the chase before I tell the whole story. If anyone has matched with a cute, brunette with a pixie cut named “Evie” in the Orlando area recently, did anything strange happen to you? That may not even be her real name and her profile is gone from the app. I’m hoping some of these details may help in case she is using another alias.

I got divorced almost a year ago from my college sweetheart. I wasn’t good at dating when I landed her and I have no idea what dating even is now. I don’t get out a lot, so I decided to “get on the apps”. I got the standard results for the first few weeks; getting ghosted, first dates that never happen, and suspiciously attractive women who want my phone number as their first text. I don’t know what the scam is and I don’t want to know. I was starting to get really disheartened.

Then, I matched with Evie, an adorable, single mom with a pixie cut and smile that could light up a room. We hit it off right away. She was divorced too and just dipping her toes in the dating pool. We both loved sushi, anime, and had toxic relationships with our exes. After a few days of texting and trauma bonding, we decided to have our first video call. I was so nervous. This was my first “real date”, if you could call it that, in well over a decade.

After tidying up behind my desk and checking my hair about thirty times, I tapped the video call button. A few painful seconds stretched out before the cutest woman I’ve ever seen appeared on my screen. Evie had the same adorable, tousled cut from her profile pic and it perfectly accentuated her petite oval face.

She smiled broadly and waved, “Hi!”

“Hey! How are you doing?” I grinned stupidly.

I was worried I was going to be anxious, but I melted at Evie’s smile. We eased our way through some small talk before I brought up how we never really dug into our shared love of anime. She hadn’t seen anything recently, the life of a single mom, but it turns out we both loved Sailor Moon. I mentioned I always had a crush on Sailor Jupiter back when I watched it before school every morning. She reached off screen and revealed a Sailor Jupiter action figure. Sailor Jupiter was always her favorite and she even cosplayed as her a few times.

Yes, I’m a nerd. But I was in love. Then, a twinkling electronic alarm went off. Evie apologized and had to excuse herself to get her daughter started with her bedtime routine. She hopped up and fluttered toward the door, her petite, but oh so cute, posterior perfectly accentuated by her forest green yoga pants. She walked out the door and I heard.

“Hey sweet girl, time to get ready for bed. Brush those chompers.” Evie lilted.

“Okay! I’m going.” An adorably, saccharin sweet voice sang back. Not 20 seconds later, “Where are my Frozen pajamas?”

“That’s not two minutes, missy!” Evie huffed.

After the requisite humming and hawing, I was treated to a pretty entertaining duet of “You’ve Got a Friend in Me”. A little later, Evie chimed a last goodnight and stepped back into the room, tousling her hair with a carefree smile on her face.

“Sorry, I had to get the munchkin all settled. I hope it wasn’t too long,” she plopped down and grinned at me happily.

I’d have waited forever at this point.

“Not at all,” I grinned back.

She blushed deep red. “So I like you. I’d love to meet in person.”

“That would be amazing,” I said excitedly.

It was the first time I’d connected with someone on a romantic level in a long time and I was over the moon. We made a date for the next weekend.

On the way to her place, I got a text saying her babysitter flaked and wanted to know if it was okay to order takeout and watch a movie instead of going out to dinner. She had said her daughter usually sleeps straight through the night, so as long as we aren’t partying too hard for two middle aged divorcees, it should be a nice evening.

I decided to be gentlemanly and stopped by the nearest Publix to grab a nice bottle of wine to go with the Thai place Evie was raving that I had to try. I was confident, bottle in hand, just before I raised my hand to knock. Was I crazy? I don’t even know this woman.

“Hi you!” Evie squealed as the door swung open.

She reached out and threw her arms around me. I was smitten. I pulled her in and hugged tight for a few seconds before stepping back to take her in. Stunning. Somehow her eyes shined even brighter in person as she invited me in. We had a little small talk in her living room/foyer before she suggested a glass of wine before the food gets here. We walked into the kitchen and I looked around as if to ask, “Where is your wine opener?”

Evie stared at me. I started looking in the closest drawer when she gasped and started fumbling through the crinkly plastic wrap around a gift basket on the counter.

“There’s a bottle in here, so they couldn’t give it to me without a way to open it, right?” She continued to feel around, “Ah HAH!”

She held up a waiter’s corkscrew as if to say, “Go for it, stud.”

I took the chance to be bold and confidently did something I saw in a YouTube video once. It wasn’t as smooth, but there wasn’t any cork in the bottle and I didn’t spill it as I poured. I was doing pretty well. We cheers-ed before taking a sip. Evie leaned in and we shared a sweet kiss.

\*DING DONG\*

The food was there. Evie chuckled nervously and then looked deeply into my eyes for just a glance before smirking, “Saved by the bell.”

We ate on her couch while watching some of our favorite YouTube videos from the past week. We laughed, got seconds, laughed some more, and then settled into the latest season of a, whether something is or is not, cake. After we polished off the bottle, Evie gave me the come-hither look. I obliged with a slow move in to kiss her for the second time tonight. We continued for a few minutes . . . or hours. I have no idea. At some point, Evie put her hands on my chest and pushed us apart.

“Let’s take this somewhere more comfortable.” The irresistible goddess stood up and reached her hands out to mine. I would have gone anywhere she asked me at that point. Evie pulled me up into a passionate kiss before taking a step back.

“Give me a minute to freshen up and come when I call? At the end of the hallway,” she winked and strode down the hall with a confident swagger in her hips.

For a second, I had no idea what to do. I know it’s different when you’ve had a few relationships under your belt, but all of this seemed overwhelming and a little fast to me in the moment. I took a second to recollect myself. “You’re in the apartment of one of the most gorgeous women you’ve ever laid eyes upon and she wants to take it further. What’s the worst that could happen? You have a good time?”

I stood up, straightened my shirt that would hopefully be ripped from my chest in just a few minutes, and took a deep breath. In my attempt to calm myself, I took a look around the apartment . . . no pictures . . . none . . . not of her daughter . . . not of her . . . none. How could she not have any pictures of . . . um . . . what was her daughter’s name? I couldn’t remember for the life of me what her daughter’s name was.

Then it hit me. There were almost no decorations in the apartment at all. A few candles and generic art prints. No clutter, no stack of mail on the kitchen island, nothing but basic decorations. Looking into the kitchen, my gut sunk even further. No toaster, no coffee maker, no small appliances of any kind. Just a gift-wrapped welcome basket and some flyers for local restaurants. The Thai place she ordered from was sitting on top of the pile.

“I’m reeaaaady!” Evie chirped from beyond her bedroom door.

I wasn’t sure what to think at that point, but she’d just moved. Maybe she didn’t have a chance to decorate yet. Maybe she was a minimalist.

I needed a second to think and saw the bathroom door on the right, down the hall to the bedroom. I splashed some water on my face and hoped to find some easily accessible mouth wash. Nothing but a stack of paper towels and a soap dispenser in the whole bathroom. No mouth wash. No toothbrushes. No shampoo, no conditioner, no body wash in the shower.

“Evvvvvaaaaaaannnnnn!” Evie sang out.

“Cooommmiiiinngggg.” I tried to casually belt out.

I didn’t know what was going on, but something seemed really off now. Then I had to know. Her daughter’s room was the one just across from the bathroom. The door was plain white, no decorations, no drawings, no stickers. I tried to slow my breathing and just reassure myself. It’s a new place.

I slowly turned the knob and opened the door a crack. Inside, I saw something I can barely comprehend to this day. Faces. Dozens of them. Hanging neatly arranged on the wall. They were knitted out of something that looked like a cross between skin and yarn. It was horrifying. Faces of all sizes, all ages, posed in agonizing screams with hollow, empty eyes glaring into my soul.

“What are you waiting for?” Evie cooed, tilting her head around the door of her bedroom.

Her voice rang hollow, thin at the end of that sentence. The hair on my neck stood on end and my eyes shifted from the disturbing scene in front of me to the door down the hallway. I froze. Staring at me from just a short few steps away was what looked like Evie’s face, but it wasn’t her face. It was a mask. Like the ones staring at me from over my shoulder.

“You’re not supposed to go in my room,” a toddler’s voice cooed out of Evie’s crocheted lips, before dropping into a scowl. Her eyes were focused on my hand still holding the doorknob of whatever twisted room I stumbled onto. Was that a mask? Or was it her . . . face?!?!

I’ve always heard fight or flight as the two options when in mortal danger. Apparently, you can at minimum fight, flight, fawn, or freeze. Typically, I’m a freeze type of guy. At least for a split second to evaluate the situation. But that face. That unnatural, cotton, not-cotton face spurred something in me I never knew was there.

I ran. Best case scenario, I’d have looked stupid on some Instagram prank reel. Worst case, god, I hoped worse case, was I ran across a very disturbed individual and all I have to do is get out of this apartment and somewhere public.

As I sprinted toward the front door, I saw the gift basket on the kitchen island. I grabbed it in both hands as I spun around, heaving it above my head. I didn’t think twice before smashing the assorted contents of the basket on the pristine tile floor. I pivoted back around and tried to ignore the grotesquely stretched maw that sprinted down the ever-shortening hallway to me.

I turned and lunged toward the front door as a piercing screech echoed across the nearly empty walls of the apartment. I heard thumping, bare footprints slap down the hallway as I fumble the deadbolt unlocked and got the door open. Then, I heard a warbled cry and loud thud with the distinct sound of glass.

Just before I swung the door closed, I saw Evie, whatever she is, standing a little shakily by the kitchen island. Her face seemed to be stained purple where she fell into the mess of wine, jam, and assorted condiments from the gift basket. Her arms and feet were dripping blood. She had a look of pure hatred on her face that I can still see in my nightmares. I didn’t take the time to do more than steal a glance. I slammed the door.

I got the hell out of there and drove around for an hour or so before going home, just in case. Now, I’m sitting here a few days later and really freaking out. I was just leaving my place and on my welcome mat was a gift basket with a note on the outside that simply said, “I’ll be seeing you.”",5,1754280576.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Hey r/KualaLumpur!

I am traveling to KL for a visit/workcation for about a week between August 12 to 17. I haven't booked a hotel, and would like to ask the community for recommendations for a good hotel in a good area of the city. 

I'd like to spend my time here trying out the food and coffee shops. If you have specific recommendations of cafes I can work out of, and try the coffee, that would be super helpful. 

I'm also coming here to buy a few things that I do not get in my home country of India. Mainly, running shoes (from brands like ON, Hoka, and Brooks), good quality supplements, and of course, the local Malaysian coffee. 

Besides this, if you could help me out on a few logistical things like these, it would be super helpful.

1. What's the best way to get around (Grab, MRT, buses, etc.)?
2. What's the best way to communicate (e-sim, public wifi, etc.)?

1mh3hvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/badreviewer/comments/1mh3hvg/bose_qc_buds_149_worth_the_hush/,Bose QC Buds: $149? Worth the Hush?,"I've been a long-time fan of Bose audio, but I was hesitant to jump on the true wireless bandwagon.  My previous experiences with earbuds had left me frustrated with poor sound quality and connectivity issues.  When I finally decided to try true wireless, the [Bose QuietComfort](https://amzn.to/4m1APuR) Earbuds (at $149) seemed like a solid, if slightly pricey, option given Bose's reputation.  I spent several weeks using them for everything from working from home to intense gym sessions to long commutes.

## Sound Quality

The sound profile is what you'd expect from Bose:  clear, balanced, and enjoyable across various genres.  Bass is present without being overpowering, and mids and highs are crisp and detailed.  I found them excellent for podcasts, audiobooks, and music, with a noticeable lack of harshness even at higher volumes.  Compared to some rivals that prioritize booming bass, these offer a more refined and less fatiguing listening experience, particularly over longer periods. The active noise cancellation is also quite effective, significantly reducing ambient noise on public transport or in busy coffee shops.

## Comfort & Fit

This is where opinions might diverge. I found the QuietComfort earbuds comfortable enough for several hours of continuous use.  The ear tips provided a good seal, minimizing outside noise even with ANC off.  However, I've seen several reviews mentioning that the fit wasn't ideal for everyone, especially those with smaller ear canals.  It's worth trying them on before committing if possible.  The earbuds themselves feel robust and well-built.

## Noise Cancellation

The active noise cancellation on these earbuds is impressive, especially for their size.  It's not quite as effective as some over-ear headphones, but it does a great job of muffling the constant hum of daily life – airplane engines, traffic noise, and office chatter are all significantly reduced.  The transparency mode is also useful, allowing you to hear your surroundings without removing the earbuds.

## Battery Life

Bose advertises around six hours of playback with ANC on, and my experience generally matched that.  The charging case provides several additional charges, bringing the total listening time to well over a day for most users.  The charging speed is decent, with a quick top-up offering a reasonable amount of extra playtime.

## Controls & Connectivity

The touch controls are responsive and intuitive, mostly.  Occasionally, I experienced accidental inputs when adjusting the earbuds in my ears, a minor annoyance easily mitigated with a little practice.  The Bluetooth connectivity was reliable and consistent throughout my testing, with no dropouts or significant latency.  Pairing was quick and straightforward.

## Value

At $149, the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds are priced towards the higher end of the true wireless market.  While competitors like the Sony WF-1000XM4 offer slightly better noise cancellation in some instances, the Bose earbuds provide a very competitive package that strikes a better balance between sound quality, comfort, and features.   The build quality alone justifies a slightly higher price point compared to many budget alternatives.

## Pros:

* Excellent sound quality with balanced profile
* Effective noise cancellation for their size
* Comfortable for extended use (for many users)
* Reliable Bluetooth connectivity
* Premium build quality

## Cons:

* Fit may not be ideal for all ear shapes
* Price is higher than some competitors
* Occasional accidental touch control inputs

At $149, the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds sit firmly in the premium segment of the wireless earbud market.  While they're more expensive than many competitors,  the superior sound quality, effective noise cancellation, and generally comfortable fit make them a worthwhile investment for those who prioritize these factors.  Compared to similarly priced rivals, they offer a compelling balance of features and performance.  If you value excellent sound and effective noise cancellation and are willing to pay a premium, these are a fantastic choice. I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for high-quality true wireless earbuds and doesn't mind paying a bit extra for a refined listening experience.",1,1754280077.0,badreviewer,0,1.0,False

Character

Kuze Haruki (久世 陽輝)

Haruki once lived in a warm, happy family — a small home shared with his loving parents and an adorable little sister who clung to him wherever he went. But everything crumbled after a tragic accident claimed his sister’s life.

The grief pushed his mother into deep depression, and not long after, she chose to leave this world behind. His father, unable to bear the loss, turned to alcohol to escape reality. Slowly, the man who had once been a kind father became someone else entirely — cold, cruel, and increasingly violent toward Haruki.

At the darkest point in his life, even Haruki’s girlfriend walked away. Afraid of being dragged into his spiraling chaos, she turned her back on him without a word, leaving him alone in the silence.

Beaten, neglected, and left with no one to lean on, Haruki made a decision. He moved out, cutting all ties with the father he once admired. Choosing solitude over suffering, he began living alone — quietly, resolutely, and with unwavering endurance.

Begin Chapter 

----

My family used to be just ordinary. Not the picture-perfect kind you see on magazine covers, nor the heart-wrenching type you'd find in tearful dramas. We simply lived together, under a small roof, in days that felt like they would stretch on forever, quiet and peaceful.

Each morning, our little kitchen would be filled with the scent of Mom's coffee. That familiar aroma crept into every nook and cranny of the house, soaking into the blankets and pillows, waking everyone up in the gentlest way possible.

Dad was always the first to sit at the table. He never changed his routine: a furrowed brow, a sip of miso soup, and a grumble that marked the start of the day.

""So bland. Did you accidentally use the vegetable rinse water or something?""

He set down his chopsticks and shook his head. It sounded harsh, but if you listened carefully, you'd realize it wasn't anger, just the kind of grumbling older folks use to remind everyone they're still around.

Mom didn’t reply. She calmly poured his coffee into a white cup and placed it before him.

""You told me to use less salt last night. Remember?""

Dad sniffed, then took a small sip of the coffee, nodding slightly.

""Still good.""

I looked at Yuki, my little sister, who was busy pushing every slice of carrot to the edge of her plate like they were mortal enemies. Her face twisted in discomfort, even though no one had said a word yet.

""Yuki, eat everything. You promised Mom you wouldn't be picky today, right?""

""But carrots are just... too strong.""

Yuki pouted, reluctantly picking up a tiny piece.

I didn’t press further. Mom simply gave her a sidelong glance and smiled. Maybe she thought, at least the girl was still trying.

Everything was as it always had been. Simple, familiar, and just enough to make each morning feel like it mattered.

As for Yuki, my little sister, she was a loud little angel. Twin ponytails, a big goofy smile, and those wide sparkling eyes that lit up every time I came home.

""Niichan!""

Before I could even take off my backpack, she'd shove a crumpled candy into my hand.

""Strawberry flavor! I kept it all day just for you! Didn’t even eat one!""

""You kept it in your pencil case, didn’t you?""

""Well, it's clean in there.""

""You're sure there's no ink on it?""

""Uhhh... probably not...""

The whole family burst into laughter. Yuki blushed, her cheeks puffed out like she was storing up all her fury. Maybe she really was mad, but all it took was a pat on the head, and she’d be smiling again in no time.

That night, while I was studying in my room, there was a soft knock on the door. Before I could even respond, it creaked open, and there she was, peeking in with sparkly eyes and something hidden behind her back.

""Niichan, I got a present for you.""

She stepped forward and held out a small hair clip shaped like a black cat with golden edges. It looked cheap, but had clearly been kept with care.

""My teacher gave it to me because I scored high. But I know you like cats, so I want you to have it.""

I paused.

""You sure? That’s your reward.""

Yuki nodded without hesitation.

""You like it, don’t you? I was just gonna look at it anyway.""

""It’s a lucky cat. You have to keep it with you. It'll help you study better and bring good luck.""

I stared at the clip, then at her proud little smile. My throat tightened. Not because of the gift, but because of the purity behind it.

""Yeah... I love it. It’s adorable. Thanks, Yuki.""

When I think of home, I don’t picture bricks or rooftops. I remember the scent of coffee, Dad’s grumbling, and Yuki running around in pajamas, shouting ""niichan.""

That was my family. So peaceful it made you believe nothing could ever take it away.

I don’t remember what moment shattered that peace.

I only remember that it rained really hard that night.

We were driving home from a shopping trip. The rain had started while we were still at the parking lot. It tapped against the windows, and the streetlights shimmered through the beads of water, casting a scene that felt gentle, yet strangely melancholic.

Inside the car, everything felt normal. Mom was checking coupons for the following week. Dad focused on the road ahead. I sat in the passenger seat, half-listening as Yuki chirped from the back.

""I’ve decided. I’m naming it Pomu.""

She clutched her new stuffed toy, her voice ringing clearly through the rain.

""Didn’t you say Mochi yesterday?""

""I changed my mind. Pomu sounds cuter, like pom-pom.""

Mom turned slightly and smiled.

""Sounds like a salad topping. Mochi might be cuter.""

""No. Pomu sounds fluffy. Like cotton.""

Dad shook his head, eyes still on the road.

""As long as it’s not named after dinner, it’s fine.""

We all laughed. Yuki puffed her cheeks again, pouting at the window like the whole world was picking on her.

I looked over. The red light ahead turned green. Everything still seemed normal. Then came the headlights.

A truck was speeding straight toward us.

Its horn screamed. Headlights glared.

It wasn't slowing down.

""Dad!""

I screamed, but the sound drowned in the rain and the screeching brakes.

Then came the crash.

Metal tore. Light exploded.

Then nothing.

I don’t know how long I was unconscious.

When I opened my eyes, I felt nothing.

Not pain. Just emptiness.

Rain slammed down. I was lying sideways on the wet ground. The stench of gasoline mixed with the metallic tang of blood. Headlights flickered in the mist. Smoke lingered.

I coughed, tried moving my fingers. Then I forced myself up. Everything ached. My head spun like it had been smashed into a wall. But I could stand. One thought echoed in my mind. Where is everyone?

""Dad... Mom...?""

I staggered to the wrecked car. The driver-side door was open. Dad lay slumped over, pale, but breathing. Mom was conscious, pinned in place, blood soaking her shirt. She turned, eyes filled with pain but clarity.

""Haruki... Where's Yuki...?""

My heart froze.

""Yuki...""

I ran to the backseat. The door was crushed. Wouldn’t open. I circled to the other side, hands bleeding as I clawed at the jammed door.

""Yuki! Can you hear me? Say something! Yuki!""

No response.

The rain lashed my face. Cold. Unforgiving.

My fists pounded the car. Blood mixed with rain.

""Please... Please answer me.""

I screamed. Every second was agony.

I searched everywhere. Underbrush, ditches, calling her name like a prayer.

Yuki, where are you?

The world blurred. My legs gave out. My head felt like stone.

I tried to speak, but choked.

Then the darkness swallowed me.

When I woke up, the white ceiling was the first thing I saw. The sterile scent of antiseptic hung in the air.

I was in a hospital bed. IV in my arm. Head bandaged.

I sat up, ignoring the pain that shot down my back.

""Yuki... Where's my sister?""

A nurse rushed in. ""Haruki-kun, please, you need to stay still. Your injuries—""

""Where is my sister?""

Her face changed. She looked down, gripping the chart tightly.

I understood.

No one had to say anything.

In that moment, my heartbeat roared louder than the storm.

And in that suffocating silence, I knew.

Something had been lost.

Forever.

1mh3f3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1mh3f3l/prolonged_loneliness/,Prolonged loneliness,"I don’t have any friends in my area so my only companionship are my husband and son. This weekend I got us all to get out of the house to try and socialize. We went to a farmers market behind a school, then a coffee shop. No ‘fruitful’ interactions. Today we went to a public eco arts festival (a dud) ,then to a happening brewery where we met a couple and their two daughters. 

They were super cute and our son’s age. But when I sat down and we started to interact, my son was too tired to calm down. I ended up leaving the venue for what turned out to be 20 minutes to walk with him and get him to be calm. By the time I walked back the family was leaving and we said bye in passing. I’m very saddened by this. 

Now we are home and he doesn’t even want to sleep. I feel like I misinterpreted his actions and lost the chance to meet a new family. It’s wounding to my spirit.

It’s so difficult to find friends and I feel like I have no one to have meaningful face to face conversations with. I feel like I am failing as a parent. It’s having a serious effect on my mental health. This felt like a joyous opportunity and I blew it.

Even though my husband is the best, best of the best- I still feel like I need to experience adult friendship. Thanks for reading. ",2,1754279845.0,breakingmom,1,1.0,False

1mh3b0q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mh3b0q,Booted Up an Old Game After Losing Two Friends in a Plane Crash. and Found Their Characters Still There,"A couple years ago, two of my close friends introduced me to this game. We spent a lot of time on it back then — they taught me how to play, helped me through the early parts, and we had some great sessions just messing around and exploring. Over time, like with a lot of games, we drifted away from it. Life moved on, and so did we.

Then on June 8th, 2025, Point Loma California, they both passed away in a tragic plane crash. Alone with their younger brother and Father.

I hadn’t touched the game in a long time, but today I randomly decided to boot it back up — not even thinking about the memories tied to it. I made a fresh start on my old save and was just exploring working on the factory, when I turned a corner and suddenly saw their offline player characters sitting there sipping on the company’s coffee. All the memories started flooding back.

It hit me hard. It felt like a piece of time had been perfectly preserved — like they were still there, waiting to jump back in. I wasn’t expecting that kind of emotional gut punch from a game, but I guess I shouldn’t be surprised. These games aren’t just pixels and code — they’re memories, snapshots of time we shared with people we care about.

Just wanted to share that. Hug your friends. Hold tight to the good moments. And don’t underestimate where those memories might show up again",428,1754279483.0,SatisfactoryGame,23,0.96,False

I took that at face value and accepted it— I also had a whiny baby with me and just was like “whatever, do 2/3 decaf then”. I made an executive decision. He’s texting me a storm but I miss it bc I’m baby wrangling, pushing a stroller full of groceries and precarious coffees while holding a fussy baby. Anyway he’s really pissed that I believed the barista over him. He just nags me endlessly. I am like, “idk I didn’t think about it too much, just took their word at face value.” He even calls up Starbucks and they apologize and say they *can* do half caf shots, and give him a free Starbucks for tomorrow. So tomorrow comes along, we’re walking to the farmers market with plans to swing by Starbucks after, we pass the Bucks on our way over and I say “*I* should be the one getting free Starbucks for my emotional suffering, bc you totally lost it on me abt the coffee.” Dredging it up again, in retrospect a bad idea. I was still pissed that he was so rude to me and browbeat me over an attempted favor. 

The whole fight starts over again, with me mainly backing off and being like “I don’t want to do this anymore, it’s such a dumb fight” and him just saying the same three things (*if it were ME I’d get the manager and make sure they got your coffee right! How do you think they make it all these other times I’ve gotten half caf?!!!* Etc) and being really shitty and rude. Eventually I break down crying and I go into the other room to think things out. And I decide I don’t want to continue this conversation, I’m done with it, and he honestly seems like he’s just trying to punish me and make me feel bad. So I’m like “I need to get out of here”. So I decide to go to my parents house bc I just can’t be around him, I don’t want to fight all day especially in front of the baby (this is weirdly probably the biggest fight we’ve had since the baby was born), and tbh I love going to my parents house anyway so it’s a nice escape for me. 

I’m just hoping he gets over the stupid fucking Starbucks fight but part of me wonders if I took it too far by letting my fight or flight kick in. I did try some conciliatory overtures but they did not succeed. I’m so torn. I am here with my parents— I didn’t tell them about our fight, it’s just too embarrassing to admit. So I’m having fun. Underneath it is some mild dread. But my baby loves being at my parents house and my high school friend is in town so I actually have a very full social calendar. I am straight up hiding out here until the heat dies down. 

I feel like a complete idiot though. Like if I told people about this fight they’d be like “how is that a fight? What is wrong with him? And with you?” And I have trouble opening up when it’s not anonymously to strangers online. So I thought I’d see if I overreacted by leaving (i took the baby of course) instead of either subjecting myself to more emotional abuse, or working through the dispute like a mature adult, depending on how you see the situation.

My fiancé and I (both 26, from Florida) are planning our honeymoon in Jackson, Wyoming for July 2026 and I’ve put together a tentative 6-day itinerary.

We’re both in good shape, but we’re not regular hikers and only hit the trails maybe once a year. Plus, we’re not super accustomed to high elevations. That’s why I left off Delta Lake—it looks stunning but also pretty strenuous and technical based on reviews. I did include Schwabacher even though it seems it is over hyped so I'm open to other lesser-known places to watch sunrise.

All day he’s been bickering with me and i guess he finally had it and flipped the coffee table and stormed off, while my daughter was on the floor playing, and my son was in my lap on the couch. Both kids got scared, I followed him to our bedroom and I told him to leave if he’s going to act insane but he said it’s his house. I told him me and the kids don’t deserve this sick unhinged man, and he made like he was gonna sock me in the head. I ducked and my heart was beating so fast (mind you i was holding the baby) but he just walked away saying “I wish I could beat the shit out of you.”

After that I got the kids and went to my daughter’s room to console them.

In the spring semester of my Freshman year of college, I met this guy on a dating app. We hit it off immediately. We texted nearly every second of every day, except when we had classes or other conflicts. We really matched each other’s energies, and while most guys think I’m weird, he thought I was hilarious. We had very similar interests, values, and beliefs, which is somewhat hard to come by due to the region of the US that I live in. Not to mention, he was the most beautiful man that I have ever seen. Usually, a man this pretty would make me feel insecure, as if I wasn’t good enough for him because I’m not the most attractive girl ever, but I didn’t feel this way with him. It was refreshing. After a week of nonstop chatting, we finally set up a time to meet. Our date was only supposed to be a morning coffee date, but we ended up spending the whole day together. In total, we spent basically 12 hours together that day because neither of us wanted to leave. I’ve never connected with someone so quickly. I’ve only ever had one long term relationship, I’ve dated around a bit here and there, but neither my long term relationship or any of my other talking stages have compared to the feelings I felt for this man. When we talked it was like a piece of me that I didn’t even know was missing, finally was put into place. I felt seen in a way I never had before. And for the first time in my life, I could picture a future where my story had a happy ending. (Side note: I’ve struggled here and there with depression throughout the entirety of my life but my mental health had gotten so much better since going to college, the best it’s ever been, but even with my improved mental state I still knew that after college I would live a solitary and stressful life. But when this guy entered the picture, I saw a new life ahead of me) After our date, we talked for about another week before he broke things off due to his busy schedule and lack of time for a relationship at that moment. I was devastated. When I read the text of him breaking things off, I cried alone in my dorm for an hour and a half straight, then sent him a very emotional text about how I liked him so, so much and how if there was something wrong with me or if I did something wrong, then he should just be upfront about it. The next day I realized my error and sent him an apology and tried to get us to talk. But it was too late. I’m guessing my emotionality scared him off. He hasn’t texted me since. I’ve tried to go no contact, but every once in a while the sadness gets too strong and I try to reach out. I know I’ve been blocked, removed, or unadded on everything, but I still try. I’ve read about limerance, but I don’t think it’s that, I genuinely believe this was love at first sight. At least for me it was. As of posting this, it’s been 121 days, basically 4 months since a man who I knew for two weeks ghosted me, and I have thought about him every day for 121 days. I have cried about this, every day for 121 days. I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried to date since, but it’s not the same, and if I push myself to date too much, I get physically ill. The scariest part is that I know he’s never coming back, and that he doesn’t think of me still in the way that I think of him, otherwise he would reach out. I know I will never care this strongly about someone again, and I will never have the feelings that i felt with him ever again. I will either be alone for the rest of my life, or I will be with someone that I know I don’t love, wishing that that someone is someone else. I am genuinely at my wits end, and don’t know what to do. This has taken over my life. So Reddit, what do I do?",1,1754278126.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
1mh2ueo,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_whypotato2123/comments/1mh2ueo/the_weaver_kenji_part_21_the_red_tape_bureaucracy/,"The Weaver & Kenji Part 21: The Red Tape (Bureaucracy, Opposition, Leadership, Resilience)","The community garden was becoming a place of magic. In the weeks following the first build day, the forgotten lot had been transformed. A winding gravel path now snaked through newly constructed planter beds. Young saplings reached for the sun. A local blog post about their project had brought in more volunteers and a small flood of donated supplies. The quiet hope of Kenji’s solitary design had blossomed into the vibrant, joyful reality of a community in action.

The success, however, had made them visible.

The letter arrived on a Tuesday. It was delivered by a courier, enclosed in a thick, stiff envelope bearing the city’s official seal. Kenji’s hands felt cold as he opened it. The language inside was a dense, suffocating thicket of legal jargon: *“Pursuant to Municipal Code 7B-14… unauthorized use of public land… pending a zoning review for commercial development… you are hereby ordered to Cease and Desist all activities immediately…”*

The warmth of the last few weeks vanished, extinguished by the icy formalism of the document. The news spread through the small community like a killing frost. The upcoming weekend build was cancelled. The cheerful energy of their group chat was replaced by a stunned, angry silence. The beautiful, cooperative organism had been wounded.

As Kenji stared at the letter on his kitchen table, the Weaver’s voice emerged, its tone that of a detached military strategist analyzing a new kind of battlefield.

*“Observation: The cooperative organism you formed is now being threatened by a larger, more powerful hierarchical structure, the bureaucracy. Your previous tools of ‘goodwill’ and ‘manual labor’ are ineffective against this new opponent. The conflict has shifted from transmuting physical chaos to navigating systemic power.”*

The Weaver paused, then offered its cold, pragmatic counsel.

*“This system operates on leverage, not sentiment. Identify the key decision-maker within the opposing hierarchy. Isolate their primary motivation, financial, political, or egotistical. Apply precise pressure to that single point. That is the most efficient path to victory.”*

The advice was chilling, but it was also… useful. Kenji saved it, a tool for later. His first task wasn’t strategy. It was rallying the troops.

He found his core group, Alex, Aunt Sarah, and George, at their usual coffee shop the next evening. The ""Cease and Desist"" order lay on the table between them like a tombstone. The mood was somber.

“It’s a developer,” Sarah explained, her voice tight with frustration. “He’s been lobbying the zoning board for months to buy that land for a parking garage. Our little garden is a threat to his plan, so he’s using this ancient, unenforced ordinance as a weapon to shut us down.”

George the contractor let out a gruff sigh. “You can’t fight city hall, kids. And you definitely can’t fight a rich guy who has city hall in his pocket. We had a good run.”

Alex stared into his coffee cup, his usual optimism completely gone. The easy victory they had achieved with their own hands seemed like a distant memory, a child’s dream.

Kenji looked at their faces, at the despair threatening to unravel everything they had built. He thought of his own journey, of the abyss, of the choice to act, of the quiet joy of laying the first stone. He had not come this far to be stopped by a piece of paper.

He straightened up in his chair, and his voice, when he spoke, was quiet but firm, cutting through the gloom.

“Building the cathedral was the first step,” he said, meeting each of their eyes. “It looks like the next step is protecting it.”

A new kind of silence fell over the table. It was not the silence of defeat, but of a dawning, steely resolve. The battle had changed. But the fight was far from over.",1,1754278029.0,u_whypotato2123,0,1.0,False
1mh2u8s,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/18/3922/reprints?utm_source=chatgpt.com,Energy Drinks May Be Dangerous for Your Health,"Energy drinks have surged in popularity, with brands like Red Bull, Monster, and Celsius dominating shelves and marketing campaigns. 

While these beverages offer promises of heightened alertness and energy, health experts warn that their stimulant-heavy formulas pose real risks—especially for those with preexisting heart conditions or sensitivities. 

Ingredients like caffeine, taurine, and guarana can disrupt heart rhythms, elevate blood pressure, and, in genetically predisposed individuals, even trigger life-threatening cardiac events. 

Alarmingly, a condition called reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS), which narrows brain blood vessels and can lead to stroke, has been linked to frequent consumption.

Despite being generally safe for healthy adults in moderation, energy drinks can exceed recommended daily caffeine limits—particularly troubling for teens, whose limit is only 100 milligrams. 

The mix of caffeine with sugar, herbal extracts, and sometimes alcohol raises the stakes, contributing to anxiety, insomnia, digestive issues, and other health concerns. Medical professionals urge children, pregnant women, and individuals with cardiovascular or metabolic conditions to avoid energy drinks entirely. Safer alternatives like coffee, green tea, and electrolyte-based sports beverages are encouraged for sustainable energy without the risks.

1mh2ss0,https://www.reddit.com/r/acquiresaas/comments/1mh2ss0/the_500k_acquisition_that_got_away/,The $500k acquisition that got away,"*The post below was originally published on my Substack,* [*Coffee + Revelation*](https://justinbutlion.substack.com/p/the-500k-acquisition-that-got-away)*.*

A few weeks ago I came across a listing on [Acquire.com](http://Acquire.com) that caught my eye. It was a listing for a B2B SaaS doing about 9k MRR. The selling price for the SaaS was $500k!!

Now if you’ve been following this substack for a while you’d know I have completed [4 acquisitions of SaaS apps](https://justinbutlion.substack.com/p/my-4th-saas-acquisition) starting in November 2022. The biggest deal I’ve done was for $97k with half of that being paid over time using seller finance. A $500k deal was an entirely different beast.

I’d usually skip over such a listing because of its size but the more I dug into it, the better it looked. I decided to reach out to the sellers and start some early due diligence.

One of the requests I made from the sellers was to get access to their Stripe account so I could start digging into revenue retention (a massively important factor for me), and other important financial metrics (ARPU, lifetime value, monthly vs. annual segmentation, etc). Thankfully the sellers agreed and I spent a good few hours going through their Stripe data.

The more I learnt about the business, the more excited I got, but there was no chance I could finance this deal on my own. I started reaching out to some close friends who I both trust, and knew had an interest in this whole acquisition game that I played to guage interest.

When a close friend of mine who had previously raised millions for his own investment fund was interested in being apart of the deal, I decided to pick up the pace and go after the deal.

I submitted a letter of intent through the Acquire system with an initial offer (portion up front + seller finance) and waited.

I had built a simple financial model based off of the previous 6 months financials and even though the seller finance portion of the deal would significantly hurt cash flow, the expected return on investment based on the assumptions in the model was solid.

The seller sent a counter offer and we went back and forth a bit over chat discussing terms. I submitted a counter to his counter which was exactly what the seller wanted (more cash, less seller finance), but unfortunately the deal fell through.

At the end of the day the seller decided to take the deal off the table and take another shot at growing the app himself.

I was disappointed because I saw massive potential in the app. It not only would take my total MRR over 10k, but it would be an app that I could focus my energies in growing. My investors and I would buy it for 3.75X - 4.5X (depending on the final deal structure) and the plan was to grow it significantly. This is the holy grail of acquisitions; buying something at a good price that you grow significantly over time. This is where the outsized gains come from.

*\*Unforunately since I signed an NDA in order to start due diligence of the app I mentioned above, so I don’t feel comfortable sharing specifics such as the name of the app, customers they worked with, etc.*

I’m drawn to people who are curious about life, who ask questions and wonder out loud, who have their own spark but enjoy sharing it.

I’m a romantic at heart, I see meaning in little gestures, beauty in unexpected places, and I hold on to the idea that some connections are simply meant to happen. I laugh easily, I care deeply, and I believe that some of the best friendships start with a simple, “Tell me about you.”

Wanted some guidance from the community on how to navigate a difficult change of faith situation. 

I’ve been a prod most of my life and so has my wife. I’ve recently been convinced through a variety of sources and scripture that the Orthodox Church is the one true church. 

I’ve already reached out to a local Father at a Russian OrthodOx Church and have been given permission to go as an observer and see the liturgy and following services. 

Problem:  My spouse still holds strongly to the Prod mindset and loves going to the Rock band  coffee church. It’s hard for me to attend; my soul searches for true workshop and reverence. She doesn’t pursue theology or try to see others positions. I want to get into Orthodoxy but having push back from my spouse ; she hears the out of context one liners from the sola scriptura modernists and believes that orthodoxy is just another form of idolatry and a power trip over women.

Question:  How have others navigated/solved this problem.

1mh2msv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mh2msv,Roommate slammed her door after I asked her to do her dishes,"I (25f) live with two other girls. A is 25 and C is 22. C has an entire floor to herself with a kitchenette so she doesn’t use the kitchen, fridge, or sink unless she’s cooking a major meal. So basically it’s just A and I sharing the kitchen and living room downstairs. She’s been living here for 10 months and I’ve been here for 2 years. We all have separate leases for our rooms and bathrooms. We did not know each other before moving in here. A doesn’t hang out in the living room so she doesn’t have to clean it but she does use the kitchen daily but also doesn’t clean that. 

She’s left her dishes for 7-10 days in the sink multiple times since moving in. I’ve never said anything because sometimes I leave mine for like 2-3 days and don’t want to be a hypocrite. But this summer the fruit flies are other worldly so I have been very strict with myself about not letting anything sit overnight because it grosses me out. I spent like $30 on those LED bug catchers and the fly tape to catch the bugs. I have attached pics of every text I’ve sent about it to the roommate group chat. 

I wish pictures could capture how bad the smell is with her dishes. It literally smells like ass in our downstairs when you walk in so I’ve been buying candles to try and cover it up because she literally won’t do her fucking dishes. Idk if it doesn’t bother her because she’s holed up in her from like 6pm to 8am and only comes out to trash the kitchen but it’s so fucking bad. 

My last straw was Thursday when I came downstairs after her shit sat in the sink for over a week and the sink stopper was FILLED with food and there was bullshit all over the walls of the sink. I was already irritated with her because of the trash thing I mentioned so I actually started tweaking. I deep cleaned the entire kitchen before I logged on for work and then texted the chat. 

In the 10 months she’s lived here, shes vacuumed and mopped once. She decided to announce she was deep cleaning over a weekend in December and then literally just mopped and vacuumed the common area. She’s never cleaned the stove off once. I do it every time. I once left the shit she got on the stove for a full week in hopes that she’d clean it and she didn’t. She leaves coffee stains on the counter and never cleans them up. She left her moving boxes in the dead center of the kitchen and living room area for months before I just moved them into the basement (I asked her multiple times to move them). 

This was all happening originally during the Philly trash strike, so that was also awful. When the trash finally got taken, the smell outside of our house was fucking horrendous. I took an hour and spent like $25 on fabuloso and some specific cleaner that works on concrete and scrubbed the sidewalk in front of our house with a broom until the smell was gone. I also ice and shovel in front of our house in the winter. I’m the only one who takes out the trash. I’m the only one who brings in the recycling bin in. You get the picture. If I do not do these things, no one will do them. 

Tonight I decided I can’t just be a keyboard warrior and text about it so in the most even tone I could muster I just said “can you please do your dishes tonight” and she said yes and slammed the door to her bedroom. It’s been 3 hours and the dishes are still in the sink and it’s 11pm where we are. What do we think the odds are they’re done before she leaves for work tomorrow?

I know it sounds like nothing for me to ask her verbally, but when we’ve had convos about other minor issues in the past she blames whatever she did or didn’t do on being neurodivergent, having anxiety, and being depressed. I’m also anxious, depressed, and have adhd. I have never told her those things because they’re irrelevant 99% of the time because we do not interact. it’s so upsetting every time there’s an issue and she pulls that out. I literally spiral about the most minor interactions with her hours because she makes me so anxious. 

Would it be dramatic to involve the landlord? At this point it’s inhibiting my ability to use and enjoy the home and common areas, and we aren’t on the same lease so it feels less and less like a roommate conflict the more times it happens and more and more like it’s a lease violation on her part.

Well, this month I had a hard time finding a pharmacy that could get 10mg zenzedi.. not sure why, but seems like all the pharmacies in my area had supply issues with the 10mg doses and was impossible for them to order. So I am now on generic dextroamphetamine Sunrise manufacturer.. 

Tell me why I feel absolutely cracked out??? It’s the same dose. So why is this so much different than brand? 😭 I usually take my first dose at 8am, and second dose at 12pm and never had issues with insomnia. 

The first day I tried these generics, I felt very speedy and just had horrible side effects (jaw clenching, clammy hands, racing heart, and throbbing migraines etc). Doesn’t really seem to be helping my adhd AT ALL. Well, that night I got absolutely ZERO sleep.

Due to being completely wired all night, I ended up taking my meds again yesterday thinking I’ll probably crash out by the night time due to not having any sleep the night before, and nope - another night of no sleep…

I just bought some zzzquil to hopefully help me get some rest tonight since I have now gone 2 days without sleep. 

Note: if you are wondering why I am still taking my meds even when it is giving me insomnia, I am a mother to a highly active toddler and I cannot function without my medication - especially when I haven’t gotten any sleep.. I was a complete zombie and needed that extra push to get me through the day and unfortunately, coffee gives me way too much anxiety. if I was still child-free, I probably wouldn’t have taken them again since I would’ve have the luxury to crash and sleep during the day. 

Can anyone tell me why this is happening? I originally switched from Adderall to Zenzedi to escape that “speedy” “wired” feeling I would get from adderalls levoamphetamine and even then, I would not get insomnia unless I took my second dose way too late in the afternoon.. is it even possible to return medication? I am self-pay, so I hate that I spent money on medication I don’t even want to take anymore at this point… 😔 ",1,1754277341.0,zenzedi,0,1.0,False

So, I was at this one company for about three years. In the beginning, we were so full of hope, you know? But as we hired more and more people, our business just… stalled. Leadership couldn't make a decision to save their lives, and we missed so many chances. Eventually, they just gave up on our original plan—it was a super crowded market anyway—and decided to try something completely new.

A few months later, I landed at a new startup that had just gotten its A-round funding. I was so excited. The field they were in had so much room to grow, and I even packed up and moved to a whole new city for the job... which, yeah, feels a little impulsive now.

Well, I lasted all of two months. Then they told me they needed someone with more experience. And just like that, I was thrown right back into the job-hunting nightmare.

So now I'm sitting in this coffee shop, anxiously trying to fix my resume, and all I can hear are the people around me. They're laughing, talking about their study abroad agency, their crypto trades, their physical shops. The whole world is still spinning, but mine feels like it's just… stopped.

It really makes you think... Do I have to find a job with a fixed schedule? Will finding one finally prove my worth or something?

But I know myself. I don't have that special gut feeling, at least not right now. I can't just spot an unmet need like all those amazing founders do. And yet, when I look at the job market, it feels like that's exactly what they expect. They're not looking for someone to do a job; they're looking for a superhero who can fix every problem, find every opportunity, and save the day when it all goes wrong.",1,1754276858.0,u_Alternative-Ear-3156,0,1.0,False

Everytime we went to the owner (its owned by a couple, but the woman is the one thats incharge of daily operations) would give us the run-around and tell us workers, to personally contact the accountant, fully ignoring any and all responsibility and blaming the accountant. 50% of the time when you would contact those accountant she would either give you some lackluster excuse like ""I'll look  into it"" or ""Send me the correct hours you worked"" or the other 50% of the time she would just completely ignore you and not messages back. Wait, Hang on, get this. The accountant was in CALIFORNIA, so there was absolutely no way to physically go to her office and ask for her. So you're basically at their mercy for your unpaid wages and if you ask the owner about the accountant ignoring you, she'll eventually get irate and accuse you of being the bad person for asking you for your proper paycheck and that ""you need to stop bothering her and just wait"". 1 girl I worked with said the owners boyfriend (they're not married but have a kid) yelled at her over the phone when she called about her check and told her ""Its the accountants responsibility! Call her!"". Red Flag #1. 

Red Flag #2, The owner has absolutely no idea how to run a cafe, she admitted to us to our faces ""Yeah I have no idea how a cafe runs I barely drink coffee myself, so that's all on you guys"". So from the get-go there's no standards, no official rules, which explains why so many customers complain about their drinks being made wrong, because the workers have nothing to go by. You're pretty much set up for failure. When first hired we did a  1 day ""training"" at another roastery on Grand st if I remember correctly, but again there's no official rules in beverages in the actual cafe itself. 

Red Flag #3. Everything is Wildly overpriced, the same Matcha you can get at somewhere like MokaCafe or Sippy Cafe or Odd Fox cafe for $5 is like $6-$7 and its the exact same as those other places. They have a ""Triamisu"" latte/matcha. Thats like over $8. Its just a Mocha/chocolate matcha with whipped cream Thats it. Just add chocolate syrup to your latte or matcha and thats the ""Tiramisu"". Again, pretty much shelling out near $10 for something you can get somewhere else for $5. The Avocado toast is worse. I think the Greek toast is like $12 or $13? And its just basic country loaf bread with cream cheese, feta, onions and tomatoes and olives. Its about the size of a Roku TV remote, yeah again OVERPRICED. Don't waste your money, please just save it and go somewhere else. 

Finally, Red Flag #4. They hire and fire people like a revolving door. They'll hire someone, let them work for a few weeks then fire then for meaningless reasons. One of my coworkers got fired because they accused him of ""sweating too much"" (😑) that man barely sweated a drop so I have absolutely no clue what they were talking about. The guy I worked with that did food they fired him for whatever reason, I have no idea why because he was really nice and helpful. Then rehired him and ""apologized"" saying they changed their minds (😐). Don't be surprised if you go there regularly and see 1 barista for a few weeks then never see em again and there's a whole new team. And then next week there's a whole new team again. Ridiculous.

So basically as you can tell, this place is terrible, has no idea what in the world they're doing with their business. Screw over both employees and customers. I recently heard from my former manager that apparently the couple used to live in California and the woman apparently owns other businesses over there like a weed shop and a bunch of Airbnbs. She tried to open this place over there but couldn't so they moved to NYC to try their luck in Greenpoint since this neighborhood is becoming trendy. 

Edit: Forgot to mention, the cafe likes to collaborate with social media influences, Smaller businesses like fashion boutiques, book clubs, etc. if you run anything like that in Brooklyn/NYC area DO NOT engage with them, DO NOT do any kind of business with them. I was also told by my old coworkers that the owner did business with a guy that did food supply or something? And completely screwed him over by not paying him for his shipment. But yeah this place is a complete scam, stay far away and feel free to share this post to others

TL;DR Stay the hell away from this place. DO NOT apply for a job here if you're looking for a side gig/extra cash. DO NOT come here and waste your money on overpriced drinks that will be made incorrectly. If you're the owner of a small business that likes to do collabs, event promoter, or a social media influencer of some sort, DO NOT do any sort of business collab/sponsorship with them. Don't be fooled by the decor and how ""modern, minimalist"" it looks. The owners are scum and should be barred from opening up a business ever again

- Latte (tend to prefer medium roast beans)

- Occasional plain Espresso shot

- Occasional hot coffee

The primary criteria are:

1) drinks taste as good or better than Starbucks. Honestly I’d be disappointed if the lattes weren’t better than Starbucks. I’ve had great lattes from high end commercial super automatics and also great lattes at local shops. Surely I can get this in a new machine.

2) relatively simple to make. Ease of use is very important. She wants to be able to get her coffee made quickly, make the cold foam, and be done with it. We used to use a Breville Barista Express and it made okay drinks for a few years but even with routine cleanings it became very mediocre. I've tried to troubleshoot various things but it's never returned to its original form.

3) Absolute top of budget is \~$4K but lower the better.

We were very much in love and everything went pretty much perfectly until she left for a summer abroad. I’m not much older but I did a lot early, so I had just finished college while she was starting it. As a result, we were living more like adults than college kids. When she spent the time away, she realized that she had been missing out on a bunch of “college stuff” and she broke up with me. It was devastating, and I couldn’t understand why we shouldn’t be able to figure things out.

I never initiated conversation after she got back and moved her stuff out of my apartment. All the same, she found a reason to text me once a month. After 6 months apart, she called me to tell me that she missed me, and asked if we could talk in a month when the semester started. We met for coffee and she said that when she had called me, she wanted to get back together, but now that she had had time to think about it, she had a gut feeling that it wasn’t the right time. Understandably, this was crushing. She talked about how badly she wanted to make things work but how it just didn’t feel right. I was cordial and understanding. After all, I want her to be happy, and I also want to be with someone who wants to be with me. All the same, I was crushed. It would be one thing if she just didn’t want to get back together, but SHE reached out to ME. 

We’re talking again in a few days and I just don’t know what to do. I don’t think she’s vindictive and I don’t believe she’s a bad person. This was a thoughtless thing to do but I don’t know what to think. She doesn’t want to ask me to wait for her but she thinks she’ll be ready eventually. I know my friends hate her for it and think I should cut her off but it doesn’t feel that simple.

It hurts so bad to know that we both want to be together but she just can’t do it for some reason. What can I possibly say to figure this out or untangle things? I don’t want to “convince” someone to date me but I can’t tell if she’s lost or confused or something else. I want to trust her judgment but I can’t understand what she wants or why she can’t make it work.

I know that people’s first reactions will be to assume that she’s a cruel person who is teasing me along for her own purposes. I hope that you can believe me when I say that anything she’s doing, she’s doing without malice.",1,1754276605.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

I am posting to help sell my dad's car to pay off the debt incurred from hospital bills due to surgery ng brother ko. The price is 190,000. Kia Rio Sedan 2015. Negotiable pa po ito 🥺 Details are on the last pic. You can message or call him on his number here : 09190717588

Sorry for the long read but we are desperate for funds.

My brother is 22 this year, and he is autistic. My parents are both retired, my mom put up a small coffee shop just beside our house where I help her out. Yung ate ko naman, VA sya WFH.

Last Friday po, we had my brother operated sa Pines City Hospital due to Hernia, bale yung intestines nya po lumalabas sa testicle area nya kaya nagswollen po yung testicles, and can be dangerous if left.

Supposedly, dun po kami sa Baguio General Hospital which would cost way less. Pero we can't push thru due to the lack of semi-private/private rooms. Yung available lng na rooms are the general ward, and again, my brother is autistic, non-verbal po sya, and he would be very loud and would try to run around. Due to this, my mother wouldn't want to disturb naman po yung other patients kasi alam po namin how hyper my brother would get. Especially po pag overstimulated sya, he would cry loudly and run around. Hindi naman sya violent, but with the case of disturbing patients who are resting and all, dun sana kami sa semi-private/private rooms.

The problem was, wala pong available na rooms suitable for my brother, and nung nag ask si mama sa hospital kung kelan mayroong available room, sabi nila mga 100+ nasa waiting list, and knowing that waiting too long will worsen yung kalagayan ng brother ko.

Thus, we were advised to go to Pines for his operation, which is a private hospital but costs a bit less than other private hospitals in the city.

Nagstay lang sina mama ng one day, bale operation was Friday, and nagcheck out sila ng Saturday kasi di talaga afford ng everyday stay doon until recovery. Yes, nag PhilHealth po kami, and we can't apply sa Malasakit since privy hospital.

So, from around 35k from BGH, it became 91k 🥲 We borrowed from relatives who were willing to lend to us totalling to around 20k, pati yung savings ng ate ko na and her pay this month, pero kulang pa talaga. Tapos ayaw ni hospital na mag promissory note si mama 😭 Kaya she had to take out sloan to pay off the remaining para masettle and bring my brother home. so yung sloan nya na 29k yung need bayaran naging 47k. Please don't judge my mom for bringing out Sloan.

Please please help us, willing to negotiate naman po. We are struggling since the coffee shop doesnt generate enough for our monthly expenses (bills,food,other costs din for the shop) so nagrerely din sina mama kay ate minsan (most of the times). Tapos biglang nagka emergency yung kapatid ko, and now my parent's are stuckk in debt.
--

I can provide bills po from the hospital for proof via dm. Thank you so much for reading and we hope mabenta po tong sasakyan ni daddy. Kahit short run lng, basta to pay off lng po yung debts nila mama. I know we'll get through.

# Eco-friendly Practices

Using coffee grounds in eco-friendly ways can have a positive impact on the environment. Instead of throwing them away, you can repurpose them for gardening and other sustainable practices. These methods not only reduce waste but also enrich your garden’s soil and provide a healthier habitat for plants.

# Composting

Composting coffee grounds is an excellent way to recycle kitchen waste. The grounds are rich in nitrogen, making them a great addition to your compost pile. Here’s how you can incorporate coffee grounds into your compost:

* **Add coffee grounds**: Sprinkle the grounds directly onto the compost pile.
* **Layer with other materials**: Mix them with carbon-rich materials like dried leaves or cardboard.
* **Maintain balance**: Aim for a 4:1 ratio of browns (carbon) to greens (nitrogen).

Here’s a quick guide to composting with coffee grounds:

|Material|Type|Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Coffee Grounds|Green (Nitrogen)|1|
|Dried Leaves|Brown (Carbon)|4|
|Cardboard|Brown (Carbon)|4|

By following these steps, you can ensure that your compost pile stays balanced and healthy. The nitrogen from the coffee grounds accelerates the decomposition process, resulting in rich, fertile compost for your garden.

# Mulching

Another great use for coffee grounds is as mulch. Mulching helps retain moisture in the soil, suppress weeds, and improve soil health. Here’s how to use coffee grounds as mulch:

* **Spread evenly**: Apply a thin layer of coffee grounds around your plants.
* **Mix with other mulch**: Combine with other organic materials like straw or wood chips.
* **Avoid thick layers**: Too much coffee ground can create a barrier, blocking water and air.

Benefits of using coffee grounds as mulch include:

1. **Improved soil texture**: Coffee grounds help aerate the soil, improving drainage.
2. **Nutrient boost**: They release nutrients like nitrogen, potassium, and magnesium into the soil.
3. **Pest deterrent**: Some pests, such as slugs and snails, are repelled by coffee grounds.

Using coffee grounds as mulch is simple and effective. You can also make a mulch mixture:

|Material|Proportion|
|:-|:-|
|Coffee Grounds|1 part|
|Straw/Wood Chips|3 parts|

This blend ensures that your mulch is balanced and beneficial for your garden. By using coffee grounds in these eco-friendly practices, you contribute to a more sustainable environment and healthier garden.

1mh28z3,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mh28z3/my_life_fell_apart_after_mom_died_pt_2_final/,My Life Fell Apart After Mom Died (Pt 2) [FINAL],"I waited until later. 

The house exhaled around me—long, slow, mechanical. Like lungs that had forgotten what air was supposed to taste like. The moment he shut the front door behind him, something in the walls loosened. I listened to the rhythm of his departure: six steps down the porch, gravel crunch, then the idle hum of his car pulling away. It was always the same. Predictable. 

I counted to three hundred. Then I rolled.

Mom’s door opened with the sound of a splinter remembering how it died. I hadn’t been inside since… since she passed. Since her scent still clung to the air like perfume on old clothes. But now the air was cold. Not just chilly—cold like a place that had been vacuum-sealed by time. Cold like the oxygen had been replaced with memory. Cold like her body had only just been lifted. 

I rolled in, slowly.

The desk looked wrong. It was too clean. Impossibly clean. Sanitized. As if someone had surgically removed all trace of the person who once sat there. I stared at the space where the Pathlight folder should have been—under the brass lamp, just left of the coaster that still held the faint watermark of her tea. That folder’s existence anchored me, it was the hope that maybe everything really was deliberately laid out by her for whoever came along after. Her handwriting in crisp blue ink, neat and motherly. A paper spine. A record of how to care for me. How to keep me *safe.*

Gone.

Panic rose in my throat like bile. I yanked open the top drawer. Empty. A hollow scraped through my ribs. I turned to the filing bin. The closet. The linen chest. I opened and closed the drawers so fast. My heart beat like a wounded thing trying to crawl out through my collarbone.

Nothing.

No folder. No notes. No lifeline. Only a faint smudge on the surface of the desk. A single fingerprint. Wide. Too wide. Oil pressed into wood grain like a half-buried fossil. Almost… reverent. 

And then—behind me, movement. I turned and nearly screamed. 

Tom stood in the doorway. His silhouette backlit by the amber hallway bulb. He held his keys like a charm. His expression was mild. Almost sweet. But his eyes—his eyes were dissecting me. 

“You okay?” he asked, head tilting. Like a bird watching something twitch before it dies. “I forgot my phone.”

My hands locked on my armrests. I steadied myself before I could unravel right in front of him. 

“I was looking for the folder,” I said. “The one my mom left.”

He stepped into the room slowly. Deliberate, predatory softness. Like he didn’t want to startle me—only corner me.

“Ah,” he said. “Yeah. I remember seeing that when I got here.”

“So where is it?”

He smiled then. The kind of smile that thinks it’s being comforting. But his teeth looked too symmetrical. Like they weren’t his. Like he’d borrowed them from someone more trustworthy. 

“Probably got mixed in with the paperwork I gave Pathlight.”

“You didn’t give them anything.”

A pause. The barest flicker of emotion behind his eyes. Something calculating.

“Are you sure?”

I didn’t answer. Couldn’t. He took a step closer. The keys still swung from his finger like a pendulum. Tick. Tick. Tick.

“I can help you look, if you want. You don’t have to do everything alone.”

The room shrank. The air thinned. What an empty gesture—what a monstrous thing to say. Of course he’d help. Of course he’d offer to find the evidence he erased. 

“No,” I said. “It’s fine. I’m just… overreacting.”

The words tasted like rust in my mouth.



Sunday dinner was fish. Tilapia, pan-seared and dusted with thyme. Soft vegetables on the side. Lemon slices placed just so—like Mom used to. He brought the meal to my room. The plate was warm, the presentation delicate. Fork and knife stationed to the side along with my meds. I didn’t eat it.

He sat in the living room watching a nature documentary. Humming. I closed my door and didn’t leave my room. Couldn’t. I couldn’t sit at my desk. Couldn’t stream. Couldn’t game. My rig felt alien. Plastic and cold and *touched*. 

At 7:31, he knocked. Three slow, soft taps. Measured. Practiced, as everything else than came from the man.

“I’m gonna run to the pharmacy before they close,” he said. “Forgot to stop by earlier.”

My heart climbed into my ears. If this was real—if any of it was real—I had a window.

“Yeah,” I said. “Okay.”

I heard his keys. Heard his shoes scrape the mat. Heard the door open, then close, then silence. I waited, then moved. His shoes were gone. No coat. I wheeled over to the window and saw that his car was absent from the driveway.

I rolled down the hall. Slow. Breath in my throat. Every inch forward felt like lowering myself into cold water.

The guest room door was locked. It was never locked. Apparently he thought locks were optional, I guess I thought the same. I returned with tools. The screwdriver slipped into the lock like a secret. The butter knife kept the pressure steady. I worked quickly. Quietly. The tumblers gave on the second try. The door creaked open like a wound. 

The air inside didn’t move. It just sat. Heavy. Dense. Smelling faintly of metal and bleach and something older. Something sickly. Dust floated in my chair’s front light like dandruff from something divine and decaying.

Everything was in its place. Bed made. Tight corners. Pillow fluffed.

The folding table was beneath the window. On top: stacks of medical forms. Not copies. Originals. Pathlight Home Health, stamped and watermarked. Some pages had smears. Not ink. Something browner. Thicker. Dried at the edges.

There was a corkboard on the far wall. Pinned screenshots of my stream. Freeze-frames of me mid-laugh, mid-focus. My old Discord profile—deleted three years ago. The avatar I used before Mom got sick. Before *everything.*

At that moment, I was glad I skipped dinner because I felt like I was about to empty the contents of my stomach on the guest room floor.

A leatherbound notebook sat on the corner of the bed. Hands shaking, I picked it up and flipped through the pages. It was full of notes. All handwritten. All about me. Each one dated meticulously:  
***4/23 - Doesn’t like sour candy. Wrinkles nose when she laughs.***  
***5/13 - Plays better when it rains. Loves lofi hip-hop.***  
***6/02 - Had a kitten when she was 6. Hates the smell of cotton candy.***

Each one a surgical, dissecting observation or fun fact that I’d shared about myself at some point.  
***7/19 - Said “I’m alone.” on stream. Timestamp 1:16:42***

One page, in red ink, read only:  
***She’s almost ready.***

My hands were trembling. My arms didn’t feel like mine. My lungs had forgotten how to inflate. He hadn’t just followed me. He hadn’t just watched me. He’d studied me. Memorized me. Dug into me like a maggot digging through shit.

This was a shrine. A lab. A coffin. 

I was the specimen. The experiment. The offering. 

He was never just the fucking nurse. He was the echo of every time I said I was alone, every part of me I’d ever shared online. Every time, he was listening.

I heard the car before I saw it drive by the window. 

The crunch of gravel beneath tires. The low, exhausted exhale of the engine. A door shutting soft enough to sound apologetic. Like he still thought he could slip back inside without consequence. He was back. My whole body locked. Every joint screamed in quiet alarm. The air around me thickened with viscosity. I sat frozen in the guest room, my fingers clenched around the armrest of my wheelchair. My mind raced through possibilities, each one collapsing under the weight of reality. Run? Hide? Plead?

No time.

I turned and rolled fast—out of the room and down the hall to my bedroom. I slammed the door shut behind me. My fingers shook as I locked it. Click. A tiny, fragile sound. Not enough.I grabbed my phone off the bedside table, almost dropped it. I stabbed at the screen with fingers that barely felt like mine. 

911

It rang. The operator picked up.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

""There’s someone in my house,” I whispered. “Please. I think—he’s my nurse, but he’s not. I think he’s been stalking me. Please send someone.”

I gave them the address. The words stumbled out, barely forming, just pieces of truth scraped together in panic. The operator told me help was on the way. 

She asked me to stay calm. 

Calm. I looked at my reflection in my bedroom mirror—sallow skin, wide pupils, my whole face pulled taut like a stretched canvas. There was no calm. Only that shrieking hum behind my eyes. Then I saw the tower light. Still blinking. Still on. I rolled over fast. Opened OBS and slapped the “start streaming” button with trembling hands. The scene opened, webcam on. The feed lit up. Chat appeared, like it always did. My people. The ones who watched me survive grief once before.

**“late night stream?”**  
**“hey spark u good?”**  
**“yo what’s the occasion lol”**

I leaned into the mic.

“If you’re in here, please… listen. This isn’t a stream.”

The messages slowed.

“This isn’t a bit,” I said, voice cracking. “I need help. There’s a man in my house. He’s not who he says he is.”

**“wtf”**  
**“is she serious??”**  
**“NO WAY”**

I couldn’t stop shaking. “It’s him. RainRider. He’s been here the whole time. He’s been pretending to be my nurse. I don’t know what he’s planning. But he broke into my life.”

Then the knock. Soft. Measured. Careful.  
  
“Sarah?” His voice outside my door. “Are you okay?”

My mouth filled with acid. My vision shook.

“Fuck you,” I hissed. “Stay the fuck away from me.”

“Sarah, what’s going on? Are you hurt? Can you open the door?”

The knock became a pound.

“That’s him,” I told the stream. My voice was a thread wrapped around a scream. “That’s him at the door. I called the cops. They’re on their way.”

Outside: “Who are you talking to?” A pause. “You called the cops?”

I looked around, frantic. My breath came in shards. The room warmed, pulling at the corners like a bad dream. 

Then I saw it—the tray from dinner. The knife. I snatched it just as the door exploded open. 

Tom stood there, his body blocking the doorway, his eyes scanning the room with mechanical calculation. 

“What are you doing?” he asked. His voice had the audacity to sound concerned. “Are you okay?”

I raised the knife with a trembling hand. It felt too light, too dull, too stupid to be a weapon. But it was all I had.

“Don’t come near me,” I screamed. “I saw your notes. I saw your room. I know who you are.”

He blinked again. Tilted his head. “Sarah…”

“You’re RainRider. You’ve been stalking me for years. I know you.”

He stepped forward with palms out.

“No, you don’t. You’re confused. You’re scared. That’s okay. Just put the knife down. I don’t want you to get hurt.”

“Don’t fucking touch me.”

“I’m worried about you.” His voice dropped into something gentler. Something predatory. “You’re not thinking clearly. We should talk.”

He reached for me. I slashed. The blade cut shallow across his hand. Not deep enough to do damage, but enough to make him howl, make him mad. Then he lunged. We crashed sideways into my desk. The mic toppled. The camera wobbled. The world tilted and shattered. His weight crushed me. My back screamed. My breath vanished beneath him.

I reached out—my fingers brushed the JellyMini controller on the floor beside the chair. I grabbed it. I swung. It cracked against his head. Blood dripped on my shoulder. I swung again, harder. Bone gave way. He slumped forward. His body collapsed on top of mine. Too heavy. My chest couldn’t rise. My vision darkened at the edges. I tried to scream, but nothing came out. The sound caught in my throat like a fishhook. 

I heard sirens somewhere in the distance. Faint. Doppler-shifting closer. Then darkness swallowed me.



“The next thing I remembered is waking up in this hospital bed.”

Sterile light poured down in stripes through the blinds, like prison bars thrown across my blanket. My arms were weak. My lips were dry. My chest felt hollowed out. The first thing I noticed was the cuff—cold, stainless steel around my right wrist, clipped tight to the bed rail.

“Why the hell am I handcuffed?” I croaked. My voice sounded like it belonged to someone else. “I’m not exactly a flight risk.” I gestured vaguely at my legs, draped under the starched hospital blanket. They hadn’t moved in years. They weren’t going to start now.

Across the room sat a detective in a charcoal suit. He’d introduced himself as Detective Hayes. He was a black man, maybe in his late fifties, with silver in his beard and pitted lines around his eyes. He looked like he’d seen war. Not the loud kind—the quiet, domestic kind, the kind that happened in the space between people. He didn’t have a notepad. Just a thick folder balanced on his knee and a look in his eyes like he was already disappointed in me. He’d sat there, quietly, listening to me tell my story. 

He held my gaze a beat too long. “You’re handcuffed to the bed, Ms. Silverstone,” he said finally, voice level, almost gentle, “because right now, you’re the prime suspect in the murder of Thomas Richardson.”

The words didn’t land at first. They hovered, floating just outside the room like moths, until suddenly—

Murder.

The bottom dropped out of my body.

“What? No. No, no, you *heard* me.” My breath hitched. “He stalked me. For *years*. He knew things about me—things nobody could’ve known. He impersonated a nurse. He invaded my home. I wasn’t safe.”

Detective Hayes blinked slowly. His fingers tapped once against the folder on his lap. 

“I assure you,” he said, “Thomas Richardson was a licensed in-home nurse employed by Pathlight Home Health. The story he told you was accurate. Your care was originally supposed to be handled by a…” he fumbled, “a Shirley Madison, but she had to bow out due to a family emergency. Pathlight assigned Thomas in her place. He’d only just wrapped up another patient’s contract across town.” 

He opened the folder on his knee. Pages inside shifted under his fingers—paper, records, photos, time logs. 

“But he knew things about me. Intimate things.”

He nodded once. “Your mother’s notes were very thorough. Over forty pages. Detailed meal preferences, emotional triggers, emergency protocols. She even included things you liked to watch on Youtube when you had bad pain flare-ups.” He gestured toward a stack of folders in a nearby chair, thick as a cinderblock. “She clearly cared about you a great deal.”

I blinked at them. The edges of my vision fuzzed like static. “But he was—he was watching me. I caught him pacing outside my bedroom door, kind of…”

He tilted his head. The corners of his mouth sagged. “You streamed your final interaction with Mr. Richardson. One of your moderators clipped the entire video. It’s all timestamped. We have the footage.”

I nodded, desperate. “*See?* He broke into my room. The lock was broken—he forced his way in!”

“That much is true,” he said. “But think about it. If this man could slip in and out of your room while you were asleep—spy on you, as you claim—then why would he suddenly need to *break* the door down, with a hallway camera pointed right at him?”

I opened my mouth. Nothing came out.

“Could it be,” he continued gently, “that he heard you in distress, didn’t know what was happening inside, and panicked? More so, you say he was pacing around and spying on you in the first few days. He was new to your home and in an unfamiliar environment, he may have simply been finding his way, or checking in on you.”

I stared past him, into the static noise between the blinds. The sunlight felt too hot. The room too bright.

“The guest room,” I whispered. “The shrine. The corkboard. My discord handle. The fucking notebook…”

His expression barely changed. But I saw it—the flicker of something sympathetic in his eyes. Pity. “We searched the guest room, Sarah. There was nothing like what you described. Just standard paperwork, mostly Pathlight documents. The corkboard was bare. No printouts, no screencaps.” He paused. “There were brown flecks on some of the forms. You insulated that it was dried blood.”

“Yeah.”

He exhaled, like he didn’t want to say the next part.

“Coffee.”

I stared down at my blanket. At the pale blue pattern like frost across the fabric. My hands balled into fists beneath it. “I… I don’t understand.” My voice was barely a whisper now.

He picked up a different folder from beside him and opened it. “There was a discrepancy in your Pathlight paperwork. Regarding your prescriptions. Your Zyprexa.”

“My…?”

“Zyprexa,” he repeated. “The paperwork your mother filled out states you’re prescribed 20 mg nightly with food. But Thomas’s intake paperwork—what he picked up from the pharmacy—listed 10 mg. Looks like there was an error when the forms were being transcribed.” He flipped to a photocopy of the label. Highlighted text. “He was administering 10 mg pills. Exactly what the bottle said. We found the receipt. He’d picked them up before your first day together.”

“Okay,” I said. “So I got a smaller dose. What, that made me anxious or something? That’s not enough to explain all of this.”

He met my eyes dead-on. “No, Sarah,” he said. “Zyprexa isn’t for anxiety. It’s for managing schizophrenia. Halving your dose could have induced a full psychotic relapse. Including hallucinations. Delusions. Paranoia. Possibly worse than what prompted your initial diagnosis ten years ago.”

My mouth opened. I tried to respond. Nothing came. The words dissolved before they reached my throat.

“I’m sorry,” he added, his voice suddenly so much softer it made my stomach hurt. “I guess your mom never told you. She probably included it with your CMS meds. You never would have noticed. Maybe she wanted to protect you from the stigma.” 

The world was collapsing in on itself. I had schizophrenia? For *ten* years? And now… now this meant…“I killed him,” I said aloud. Not a question. Just the weight of the truth, arriving at last. “But he knew the nickname,” I said, weaker now. “The quiet spark. He said that to me.” 

He shrugged. “Who’s to say? Maybe you heard it. Maybe you filled in the blanks. That’s new information, so our people haven’t had the chance to check his digital footprint for anything that matches that username—RainRider, I think it was. But your mother left so many notes pertaining to your care. It’s possible that she mentioned it—she did talk about your streams.”

Silence. The kind of silence that felt like it might eat me. I stared down at my own hand—pale against the sheet, cuffed and shaking.

“What’s going to happen to me?” I asked.

“That’s not my call. You’ll be evaluated. Doctors will review the full file. Right now, all I can say is…” he paused, searching for something real to say, “...you’ve been through something terrible. And you’re not alone. Whatever happens next, we’ll make sure you get the care you need.”

But I wasn’t sure I believed him. Because in that moment—beneath fluorescent light, locked to a hospital bed—I didn’t feel like someone who needed care. I felt like a monster waking up in someone else’s skin. 

The door clicked shut behind him. I lay there in the stale, humming quiet of the hospital room. One wrist still bound to the bedframe. The other curled weakly against my side. Somewhere down the hall, a machine beeped in time with a distant heartbeat. Outside the window, the sky had turned that indifferent shade of hospital gray. The color of lost time.

I stared at the ceiling tiles until they began to shift. Until the patterns rearranged themselves. Until I saw his face in them again.

Or maybe it was mine.

1mh280p,https://i.redd.it/30ao4rru2xgf1.png,Alklyte Can Help You Enjoy Coffee Again Without the Acid Burn: Neutralizing Acidity with Quad/Dual Buffers,"For years, coffee was a double-edged sword—essential for energy and focus, but almost guaranteed to trigger **reflux**, **stomach discomfort**, or that familiar sour stomach. I tried low-acid beans, cold brew, even mushroom coffee... but nothing worked consistently.

Then I learned that the key isn’t just the type of coffee—it’s **how your body buffers the acid load** that comes with it.

# Why Coffee Is Acidic

Coffee contains a mix of **chlorogenic acids**, **quinic acid**, and other organic compounds that lower the pH of the beverage and contribute to **gastric irritation**, especially in people dealing with:

* GERD / acid reflux
* Gastritis or LPR
* Dietary acidosis
* Kidney stress

The solution isn’t necessarily giving up coffee. It’s about **buffering the acidity** both **in the cup** and **in your body**.

# What Alklyte Does Differently

**Alklyte** is a precise blend of specific molar ratios of **bicarbonates (sodium/potassium) and citrates (potassium/sodium). The mix is precisely designed to support a healthy acid-base pH balance.\***

These compounds are the **exact same types of buffers your body naturally produces** to stabilize pH and neutralize acids. When added to coffee (or taken with water before/after drinking), Alklyte:

* **Neutralizes the free hydrogen ions** (acid) in the coffee directly
* **Provides systemic buffering support** that reduces the total dietary acid load
* Helps protect the **gut lining** and **kidneys** from chronic acid stress

It’s not just about raising the pH of the coffee itself—it’s about improving the way your **entire body handles acidity** after consumption.

# Real-World Impact

Since using Alklyte, I’ve gone back to enjoying coffee without fear of flare-ups. I don’t rely on PPIs or chalky antacids anymore. Just a scoop of Alklyte stirred into my morning coffee or taken in a glass of water beforehand has made all the difference.

And the science backs this up. **Citrate and bicarbonate salts** have been shown to:

* Reduce symptoms of **GERD and reflux**
* Improve **acid-base balance** possibly helping those with chronic kidney disease (ask your doctor first before using if you have CKD because it contains some potassium)
* Support **gut barrier function** and microbial balance
* Help reduce **dietary acidosis** linked to fatigue, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunction (see recent posts in this group for peer-reviewed studies)

# Takeaway

You don’t have to give up coffee to feel good—you just need a better buffering strategy. For me, that’s **Alklyte**.

Let’s talk:

* Have you tried alkalizing your coffee?
* What buffers or supplements have helped you?

1mh27fm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mh27fm,"Jacques- Utrecht, Netherlands 🇳🇱","A few weeks ago, I got to spend some time in the Netherlands and check out the café scene. One place I stumbled upon was “Jacques” in Utrecht. What initially pulled me in was the selection of beans on the wall. My primary interest was to buy beans from my travels and bring them back to the USA. As I entered, I was greeted with a great big smile from the barista. He was eager to be of help when I was asking about the bean selection. After some time, I went with a couple of bags of RumBaba as I had never heard of them before and was intrigued by the varieties and mainly, tasting notes. 
The barista asked if I’d like a drink on the house; after all, I was spending good money on the beans! I said, “Make me whatever you’re most excited to make.” He pulled a bag of beans out from his personal collection. A roaster from Ukraine called “Penyora”. A wonderful cup with top notes of citrus. The conversations we had about our respective café cultures and passion for coffee were awesome and inspiring, knowing that coffee can transcend culture, people, countries, and politics— especially in this day and age. If you find yourself in the area, I highly recommend going to Jacques. And if you are a serious coffee person, stay tuned for my next post about Bankai, which is located right around the corner.",12,1754276065.0,pourover,1,0.93,False
1mh26qt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1mh26qt/creatista_pro_for_200/,Creatista Pro for $200?,"A couple years ago, I switched to a vertuo plus over regular drip or pour-over coffee machines, mainly due to how quickly I can get my morning coffee with the least amount of clean-up. I do love it and I have some regular vertuo pods I quite enjoy. I like the occasional latte and have tried a few espresso pods but even the darker ones I don’t find strong enough, and my aerrocino seems to never heat milk enough for my liking. I just noticed a Creatista Pro pop up on marketplace for $200 (Canadian), and I am so tempted to buy it. I do understand it is not going to give me a regular large cup of coffee that I am typically used to, and I know the vertuo doesn’t do true espresso.

Admittedly, I wouldn’t be looking to buy a separate espresso machine if it wasn’t for this great deal.  I do think i would likely drink more lattes if it was a quicker process than using the aerrocino, and if i find some great pods for americanos, i’d certainly make use of that function on a regular basis as well.
