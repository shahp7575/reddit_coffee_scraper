It‚Äôs been over a year since we broke up. No messages. No late-night calls. No lurking on socials. I genuinely thought that chapter was over for good. I even blocked him, not out of spite, but to protect my peace.

I thought he moved on. Turns out, I was wrong.

Last night, I got an email. An actual, honest-to-goodness email. Who even does that anymore?

The first line?

> ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know if you‚Äôll read this, but I miss you.‚Äù



And just like that, I felt everything all over again.

He said he‚Äôs been thinking about me, how I used to remind him to take his meds, how I‚Äôd stay up waiting for him to get home, how I‚Äôd always choose him, even when it was hard.

And then he said something I never expected.

The child he stayed for? Turns out, not his. He tried to do the right thing. To build something out of a moment he didn‚Äôt expect. But the foundation was never love,it was responsibility. And now, after everything, that illusion is gone.

He said the moment he got confirmation, his mind went straight to me. To us.

> ‚ÄúI was never really over you. I think I was just trying to fill the space you left behind.‚Äù



He remembered everything. Our road trips. My weird car karaoke. The way I‚Äôd hold his hand, even in silence. He even got my coffee order right.

And then he asked if we could talk. Just once.

> ‚ÄúMaybe not to fix things,‚Äù he said, ‚Äújust to see if the spark is still there‚Ä¶ or if it ever even left.‚Äù



And here I am,rereading that email like an idiot. Because some small, stubborn part of me is still soft for him. Still wondering if maybe we weren‚Äôt wrong for each other. Maybe we were just off-tempo.

But why now?

Why do they always reach out when you‚Äôve finally started to feel okay again?

Anyway, I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll reply. But I had to let it out. Because tonight, my heart is loud, and I don‚Äôt know if I want it to quiet down just yet.",1,1746893416.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

1kjdrwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/1kjdrwf/may_4th10th_trip_report/,May 4th-10th Trip Report!,"Hi everyone! I‚Äôm writing this as I sit in the Barcelona Lounge waiting to go to the airport and begin our trek home. Sad face. 

This was the first big trip I‚Äôve taken to Disney post COVID‚Ä¶ and I have some thoughts. 

First, the good!

Resort:
We stayed in Gran Destino Tower in Coronado Spring. Y‚Äôall, I cannot rave about this resort enough. This was probably the best experience I‚Äôve ever had in a Disney resort. The decor is beautiful, the rooms are clean & comfortable. The staff was great. Coffee was top tier. Shout out to the cold brew at the Barcelona Lounge. This will be my go-to resort for the foreseeable future. 

Three Bridges Restaurant was AMAZING. The food was excellent and the ambiance is beautiful. Reasonably priced in relation to the rest of property. 

Main pool is neat. Probably the most fun out of all the other resorts I‚Äôve stayed at in the past. We preferred the smaller pool because there were Dance/Cheering Competitions at the convention center & as two adults we preferred to avoid that. Even with the large groups, it was still quiet and enjoyable. Honestly, the parents were more of a nuisance than the kids. 

The bus transportation has 100% improved since last I used it. Busses came quickly & got us where we needed to go. I used to be a firm believer in renting a car, but after this week, I am confident it relying on the bus system again. 

The bad:
None! Yay Coronado Springs!

The Parks:
Magical as always. They were a little crowded, but what can you do. Lightning Lane system worked. Did the job. 

Got engaged on Rise of the Resistance, so that was great! 

The bad:
Disney. You need to add more bottle filling stations and places for guests to cool down. It was 90+ degrees every day. We only managed to do a full day on EPCOT day. 

The heat sent us back to the resort by 2pm for DHS, MK & DAK. I had Fantasmic reserved seating we didn‚Äôt get to use because it was just too hot. When I‚Äôm paying over $1k for park entry and I can‚Äôt get a full day out of it because it‚Äôs becoming a health risk, invest in a solution. 

The security check. Get. More. Security. Agents. If you‚Äôre going to screen that many people at once, more than 8 operating at a time isn‚Äôt enough. Then when you do get to the agent, they‚Äôre more interested in chatting than just going through the bag. Dude, I‚Äôm on a schedule. Move it along. 

Monorail transportation. They need to do a massive overhaul on the monorails. The speakers are blown out, they‚Äôre constantly delayed because of maintenance issues. They‚Äôre getting gross looking. On Tuesday, the resort monorail wasn‚Äôt operating and I was late for a spa appointment at the Grand Floridian because the CMs were just standing around chatting instead of relaying information to the hot, cranky people in the cars trying to get to breakfast reservations. 

Animal Kingdom only serves breakfast until 10am. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the complaint. Park opens at 9am, breakfast is only served until 10am. It‚Äôs taking you at least 30min to get through security & if you‚Äôre wanting breakfast at Satul‚Äôi Canteen, you‚Äôre SOL unless you have early entry. I wanted that Fritata, man. Heartbroken. 

Had some weird interactions with Cast Members‚Ä¶ None of them seem like they want to be here. Which I get. I was a Cast Member and there were days that I was not feeling magical‚Ä¶. But more often than not my interactions were cold or I got the vibe I was just bothering them. I‚Äôm very much a ‚ÄúI will figure it out on my own‚Äù traveler/guest so I didn‚Äôt talk to many. Definitely different from my standard Cast Member interactions pre-COVID. 

Final Thoughts:
We had a great time! Hotel was lovely. Attractions & experiences were great. There‚Äôs a lot of things showing their age. More cooling stations & staff are definitely necessary. I hope they start listening to guest feedback and make the changes. We will see! 

We‚Äôre already talking about our next trip. We had a wonderful time and, as always, see ya real soon!

Lately, I‚Äôve been carrying this heavy feeling... wondering if anyone else feels it too. I try not to dwell on it, cuz it's kinda overwhelming, but still, it's there. You know, this whole thing about where humanity is heading‚Äîclimate change, societal divides, everything spinning faster than I can keep up with.

I sometimes sit there, sipping my third cup of coffee for the day, and think about how things used to seem simpler when I was younger. Or maybe I was just blissfully unaware. But now, as I scroll through headlines, I can't help but feel a mix of worry and hope.

Is it weird to worry for the future of people I haven‚Äôt even met? Or the thought of the world my (potential) kids might inherit? I guess what scares me the most is feeling powerless in all of this... like how does one person make a real difference?

Anyway, hope I‚Äôm not the only one feeling all these feels. Just wanted to throw this out into the universe and maybe find some comfort in knowing we're all kinda in this together. Stay hopeful, if you can. I‚Äôm trying like heck to do the same. üå±",1,1746893216.0,LettersToStrangers,0,1.0,False
1kjdr5p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kjdr5p,"Got my first ""Missing Items"" notice this week","Like the title says, I got my first missing items notice this week. Apparently, the claim was submitted on Monday for a Food Lion order from Sunday night, but I didn't see it until earlier this morning when I was trying to see my ratings from a customer from last night. If you look at the receipt (3rd image), you can see the frozen broccoli florets is quite literally the first item listed on the receipt. The cotton candy grapes, is literally the last item listed on the receipt. (To be fair, the way Food Lion orders the items on the receipt isn't the order in which they were scanned. They're separated by category/department.)

This customer is definitely lying because the grapes were the first item I shopped for because the produce department of that location is the first place you go as soon as you walk in the door. The broccoli was the third-to-last item I got because the frozen aisle is before the dairy on the next aisle.

I knew it would happen eventually because of all the experiences I've read people here have, but it still grinds my gears that people actually do this to others. I don't know if they were upset that certain specific things they wanted were out of stock and decided to take it out on me, as if I control Food Lion's stock, but it's stupid because they approved of all the replacements and had pre-approved replacements in the app (4th image). Maybe they lamented how much money they ended up spending?

The thing that really gets me, and I hope Instacart takes into account, is if these items were truly missing, why wait until the next day to file a claim and negate removing/reducing the tip? The tip was always a flat $10 (5th image). There was no reduction nor removal. I'm annoyed, and that definitely came through with the language I used in my dispute, which I have included below. I think I may have been a bit too harsh in my response, and that my come back to bite me. I felt good about it in the moment, however, so we'll see what happens from here.

*""This customer is lying! There were no missing items. The cotton candy grapes was quite literally the first item I shopped and put in the basket. When you reference the receipt, it's the second item listed for the ""Produce"" section. The same goes for the frozen broccoli florets. That was one of the last items I shopped for, and I distinctly remember searching for and grabbing them. Again, referencing the receipt, the broccoli is literally the first item listed. I'm not sure if they're upset because Food Lion was out of certain items they wanted, but they approved of the replacements and had pre-approved replacements in the app that I chose for them. This scam they're trying to pull to get some money back is ludicrous because the broccoli and grapes were items that didn't require replacements. This needs to be removed from my account and the customer blocked. If the items were truly missing, why wait until the next day to say something about it? Why would they not have removed/reduced their tip? It is clear as day this person is lying, and something needs to be done about it.""*",1,1746893199.0,InstacartShoppers,0,1.0,False
1kjdprg,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1kjdprg/my_heart_goes_out_to_the_in_officehybrid_folks/,My heart goes out to the in office/hybrid folks.,"I don't know how people do it.

Im fully remote, will never be RTO. 99+% of my company is either hybrid or in office full time. It's a manufacturer, I work on the sales side.

I need to rely on people in the office so I try to visit the office 3 or 4 times a year. A little face time, take people out to eat (amusingly on the company dime) and just build my relationships with them.

Anyways, I was in the office for 2 days this week so this is why I wanted to post.

1. It's so loud! Not an overall noisy environment but my cube I was sitting in, I could hear everyone on the phone, teams calls, and general conversation. 

2. It's less productive. Seeing people going to get coffee, chatting with neighbors, normal socializing. I get as much work done at home in about half the time. 

3. Distractions. From people walking by the cube to people stopping by. It's a constant. 

4. Privacy. Anyone can see your screens walking by. They can see if you're looking at your phone. SHARING A BATHROOM!!

5. Parking/clothes. Having to fight for a good parking spot and dressing office appropriate every single day. 

Now, on a positive note, my company is a really good company. Everyone is so nice, helpful and just overall friendly. People seem to genuinely like each other. I mean, they did a thirsty Thursday to a beer garden and something like 20+ people went. Different departments and age groups. Plus, if you need to ask a question, you can actually walk over and talk to someone vs sending a Teams message/email and waiting for a response. People help the in person people first 

I've been fully remote for 9+ years. I could never be office based. I realize that I am loud on the phone, especially if I get excited. I would hate to dress like an adult every day. Packing/bringing lunch. The fact you can't just get away from work, for even 5 minutes, without other coworkers everywhere. ",3,1746893092.0,remotework,0,0.8,False

Like I have to watch what I say because it might offend them. It's not that I want to be liked it's that these are people I live or work with or are relatives. Offending them just means more time that is awkward. Or it can mean they are then colder to me.

It's not that I want to say something like, ""Jesus you are stupid."" Here's an example: One person I live with tends to ask me things first thing in the morning before I've had coffee. Like, ""Can you take the trash out sometime today?"" I'm fine with the request. I'm fine with doing the task. I just don't want to be asked that stuff before I wake up. Plus, it seems it would be kinder on their part to start the day with a ""Good morning"" and then maybe after a few sips of coffee, ""How you feeling today?""

So the problem is, my brain wants to say: ""Can you please just not put things on my to-do list first thing in the morning?"" But I feel like my voice and attitude will show I'm annoyed. Which I kind of am. But that's because I'm not awake and engaged yet.

So I feel like the moment I'm around people, even family, I'm ""triangulating"" everything.

It's exhausting. It's why I'd rather be alone. Is this an introvert thing or is is a ""me"" thing?",2,1746892960.0,introvert,0,1.0,False

They gave out my personal information, the distance and elevation estimates were inaccurate, and many preventable issues for a race that has been running for 30+ yrs.

¬†

1. Background:
   * Successfully completed 50k ultra in Utah, several road race marathons, DNF'd a 50k halfway through in March due to conditions/mild food poisoning. Trained for vert, trained on trails, trained for duration.
   * I have been training to do the Barkley FC since October 2024 (race 2025)
   * I had been travelling the last nine days for work and wasn't able to do a proper carb load so fueling wasn't ideal in the week before the race.
2. Pre-Race / Logistics:
   * Packet pickup was day-of, just a bib.
   * Using a Salomon Avd skin 12 vest with qty 2 500mL bottles, one water one 320 mautren mix, spare packs in vest and nerds gummy clusters on each side for additional snacking. Hoka speedgoats because I haven't forgiven Saucony's lack of grip yet and I know this is going to be a lot of rocky climbs.
   * Had a solid breakfast and 1L of water with some coffee on the drive over (carpooled)
3. Race Breakdown:
   * I walked into this fresh off a strategic/non injury DNF in CT. I thought to myself ""Hey, it won't be worse than high 30's and rain you had at Sleeping Giant!"" and let me tell you I would be wrong.
   * The start- I was in a later wave anticipating a finish time between 3:30/4hrs given previous experience with trails and knowing the elevation (4.5k'). I started out and discovered the course could be best described by a pile of leftover scree mixed in with about 30 or so false summits. There are 'seven' summits but other than the first and last I couldn't pick them out of a lineup. It's in the woods but no leaves on the trees yet so there was minimal shade other than what you could get by hugging a tree trunk. Black flies were feasting. Ticks jamming. Runners were already starting to drop, one had a bad ankle injury and had to hike it back.¬†
   * Aid station one- just water, someone was begging for electrolytes so I gave them a salt pill. Elevation claimed another drop at the aid station where I thought to myself that it's a smart move to drop when you can catch a ride. People are looking rough and moving slow.
   * The middle - There are drums somewhere, I see a group of men, they're harassing some of the female runners. Fantastic, I push through. It's getting really hot but I'm trudging along and clinging to 4hr pace.
   * Aid station two- water rationing is mentioned, I manage to fill one bottle, carry on.
   * Where does this end- There was a hut of some kind just before/after the turnaround where the water wasn't potable but you could squeeze your arms into the tiny sink and cool down- but only if you knew this was a thing. It wasn't marked. I walk right past this little sanctuary not knowing.
   * Turnaround aid station- Some form of electrolyte mix (very dilute) at the turnaround point. Snacks at the end station were pretzels, half a peeled clementine, and some snacks with peanut butter if memory serves. I ate the clementine and filled my bottles. There was a volunteer trying to direct someone driving to the aid station who I assume had more supplies but had gotten lost. I down two cups of sams club cola. I carry on but there's a lot more sad faces.
   * The hut- I leave someone at the hut who sat down and in the most peaceful manner told me they were going to wait for the pacer. I manage to cool down a bit using my arms but there was an elderly woman going crazy in there do I left. Not long after I encounter a runner who had been blacking out, another suffering from the heat, and a saint who stayed with them to wait for EMT's. She said it took them over an hour to arrive- I don't know if this is true, but given the rest of the race I believe it. We weren't even far from the road the hut is on.
   * Aid station two - water rationing and a 'two minutes!!!' warning had me fill bottles and run.
   * The middle - I keep finding struggling runners. The heat is in full swing and I don't think anyone has had enough water access or salt in the back 1/4 of the pack. We're crawling at this point- 26-28 min miles. Properly dehydrated and just trying to have my water last. How was a liter of fluids between each aid station not enough? Oh wait, because rationing. Right. The race photog leaves and passes me telling me to 'look faster'. At least I won't have a picture of my face upon hearing that.
   * Aid station one - water rationing again. You know, for being as dehydrated as I was, and given that the weather was a known factor days before this race, it was disappointing. I meet other runners, one of whom was planning to wait out the clock. I drink an abandoned 1/2 bottle of sun-cooked Powerade left on the table and carry on with a group of about four others. We call ourselves the survivors. This would be true for some, not for others.
   * The start- trying to get back to the start two members of our group started really flagging. Swollen fingers, pausing frequently (we all were) and absolutely cooked. We'd been trying to find an EMT but only found an abandoned EMT ATV. Then, of all things, thunder starts rumbling. I text my friend who carpooled with me to send EMT's to us from the start line. Given how this race is all on mountaintops me and two others start hauling to get down to the start (we left the others in as safe a spot as we could). We pass the EMT walking. It sprinkled on us but the gust front (which was lovely) said get the eff off the trail and we managed to finish in 5hrs.

¬†

* Weather conditions started as \~63F and 87% humidity spiking to 86F with 43% humidity. It was the hottest day of the year so far.

1. Highs and lows:
   * High
      * Nice race for training elevation on trails
   * Lows
      * Unsafe management of hydration given conditions
      * Unsafe trail management
      * Delayed/absent EMTs
2. Finish:
   * The band of survivors whittled down to just two of us at the very end, the ladies. Myself and the trail angel who helped stay with the blacking-out runner by the hut. The last gentlemen of our group finished shortly after. 5hrs.
   * Post race there was water (finally) and bagels. Not much else, no beer I saw, nothing salty, so I just hopped in the car and drank the very warm ensure max protein I had stashed. We left and I got a large coke and milkshake from McDonalds.
3. Takeaways:
   * What worked:
      * Sunscreen
      * Salt pill stash
      * Hut sink cooling
   * What didn't work:
      * Trusting that there would be safety checks or limits where they would pull runners off
      * Not having enough water at aid stations for all runners
   * Advice for future runners considering this race
      * Have a spare bottle for emergency use - even if it's just for the non-potable water to dunk on your head as you walk
      * Consider the elevation, it's no joke
      * Bring salt pills and spare snacks
      * Bug spray- everyone I knew who had run it said 'there are never any bugs!' lies. Absolute lies. Bring the spray.
      * Tick check buddy- I watched them crawling all over the trail- have someone who can give you a very good check after.
      * The race director will connect you (without consent?) to other people who live near you in an attempt to make you carpool together. I don't think there's any data privacy I signed away that permitted that, so if you're cautious about people knowing your name and the general area of your house then FYI.
4. Thanks and Shoutouts:
   * Thank you to the person who told me about the sinks in the hut.
   * Thank you to the aid station volunteer who let me know about the half-drunk Powerade.

1kjdkxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TLRY/comments/1kjdkxg/thc_drinks_are_flying_off_shelves_can_it_last/,THC drinks are flying off shelves. Can it last?,"Sat, May 10, 2025

In June 2023, Jon Halper started selling THC beverages at Top Ten Liquors, his chain of Minnesota stores. The drinks, which contain the main intoxicating chemical compound found in cannabis, were a massive hit.

‚ÄúImmediately, the sales took off,‚Äù said Halper. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve never seen anything explosive like this.‚Äù

**After just two years, THC beverages make up about 15% of overall sales, he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to believe this growth isn‚Äôt going to be astronomical.‚Äù**

**The time is right for a THC beverage boom.** Many Americans are embracing a California sober lifestyle ‚Äî drinking less alcohol, which they see as harmful to health, and trying out marijuana instead. A study published in 2024 found that a higher number of Americans reported using cannabis every day than drinking alcohol daily.

And thanks to what many consider to be a loophole in the 2018 farm bill, THC beverage makers have been able to rapidly launch their products across the country with little oversight. Now, states are trying to make sense of the bill‚Äôs language, setting up their own regulations and raising questions for the future of the fast-growing industry.

A category that came out of nowhere For years, beverage companies toyed with the idea of using THC in drinks. But cannabis is a tricky business. Marijuana is a ‚Äúschedule I controlled substance‚Äù in the United States, meaning companies that sell marijuana products legally don‚Äôt get certain tax benefits. The classification also makes it hard for those firms to get funding from financial institutions wary of breaking federal laws.

So drink makers avoided cannabis. Then the 2018 farm bill changed the game.

The lengthy document governs a wide range of agricultural and food assistance programs, and it includes a few pages that legalized the production of hemp, defined as a cannabis plant that has no more than 0.3% delta-9 THC on a dry-weight basis (cannabis plants with higher concentrations of THC are classified as marijuana). That language spawned a fast-growing market of technically legal THC beverages that are still potent enough to make you feel something.

At the time, ‚Äúthese drinks did not exist,‚Äù said Frank Colombo, managing director of Viridian Capital Advisors, which specializes in cannabis. ‚ÄúNobody anticipated this whole category of hemp-based intoxicants, let alone hemp-based THC drinks.‚Äù

In 2020, the US market for hemp-derived THC drinks amounted to about $400,000, according to Brightfield Group, a consumer insights and market research firm that has been tracking the THC drink industry. By 2024, the market had grown nearly 10 times bigger, reaching $382 million dollars. This year, it will grow to $571 million, Brightfield predicts, with more expansion to come.

THC beverage makers have been exempt from the onerous regulations that apply to marijuana companies. But some entrepreneurs seek a Goldilocks zone for regulation: Too little could allow bad actors ‚Äî those who market to children or sell high-dosage products made with synthetic ingredients ‚Äî to proliferate, encouraging bans. Too much would constrain growth. But the right amount would legitimize their businesses, putting them on a path to skyrocketing growth.

Companies are betting that things will go their way. Experts are not so sure.

‚ÄúI do not think it‚Äôs going to go perfectly,‚Äù said Hilary Bricken, an attorney with Husch Blackwell who focuses on the hemp and cannabis industries. She can ‚Äúappreciate the confidence‚Äù of young companies trying to forge a path, but ‚Äúit‚Äôs still going to be a bumpy road.‚Äù

From dispensaries to liquor stores When Cann first launched in 2019, the THC beverage was only available at a handful of cannabis dispensaries.

‚ÄúAt the time, we thought that was the only place you could sell these products,‚Äù explained Jake Bullock, co-founder and CEO of Cann. The drink had initially derived its THC and CBD, a non-psychoactive cannabinoid present in Cann drinks, from marijuana. Then in 2022, a new Minnesota law helped clarify the farm bill‚Äôs language, explicitly allowing certain hemp-derived THC products to be sold to customers aged 21 or older.

‚ÄúWe were like, ‚ÄòWell, wait, can we extract THC and CBD from hemp?‚Äô‚Äù Bullock recounted.

They could, and it took just 60 days. Cann launched the updated product in Minnesota in October of that year.

Today, Cann is sold in stores across 30 states and available direct-to-customer in at least 35 states. In 2024, revenue grew over 70%, according to the company. It expects over 100% growth this year.

Cann and other THC drink brands describe their products as social tonics, designed to give a light, mellow buzz that, they say, will help you feel good at parties but not hungover the next day. Cann‚Äôs drinks come in flavors like blood orange cardamom and yuzu elderflower and have no more than 10 milligrams of THC per can.

‚ÄúIf you think about alcohol and caffeine, we drink these in microdoses,‚Äù Bullock said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason you can have a few cups of coffee or a couple of glasses of wine. We wanted to capture that same kind of concept.‚Äù

The competition heats up Even shoppers who aren‚Äôt familiar with THC drinks are in the market for a new kind of beverage: Stroll down a refrigerator aisle and you‚Äôll see prebiotic sodas in countless flavors, botanical teas, canned lattes with a variety of milks, sparkling everythings, non-alcoholic beers and more.

And over the past few years, Cann has been joined by scores of competitors.

For example, hi Seltzer, a calorie-free drink that comes in fruit flavors and contains five milligrams of THC, launched in 2023. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre running somewhere between 1.2 (million) and 1.5 million cans a month,‚Äù CEO Louis Police said in April, ‚Äúwhich doesn‚Äôt even satisfy the demand.‚Äù

BRƒíZ, a THC beverage brand that use lion‚Äôs mane mushroom extract, has seen sales explode since it started in 2023. In 2024, the company recorded about $28 million in revenue, said founder and CEO Aaron Nosbisch. This year, it‚Äôs on track to hit about $75 million.

The market has also attracted alcohol makers like Samantha Lee, co-founder of Hopewell Brewing Company in Chicago, Illinois. Last year, she and her Hopewell co-founders (plus one more) launched Choom, a sparkling canned THC beverage that comes in mostly citrus flavors.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing a lot of our current customer base who are really excited about (Choom),‚Äù she said.

Lee is optimistic that Illinois will regulate the market in a way that well help business thrive.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing a lot of positive movements in Illinois that will codify this as a law,‚Äù she said. But until that happens, major retailers may avoid selling brands like Choom. Without clear regulation, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs only so much we can do.‚Äù

A patchwork system The Hemp Beverage Alliance (HBA), a trade group formed two years ago, shares its own regulatory principles on labeling, dosing, age restrictions and more on its website. Brands are also educating distributors, retailers and consumers about their THC drinks. But self-regulation can only go so far.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be challenging for someone to truly break out‚Ä¶ until there is something at the federal level that is a clear indication that these products can be scaled and will be legal,‚Äù said Duane Stanford, executive editor and publisher of Beverage Digest, a trade publication.

Ideally, there would be ‚Äúa federal framework that guides the entire country‚Äù said Christopher Lackner, president of the HBA.

But that‚Äôs a moonshot, at least in the near term. For now, the alliance, which represents over 250 brands, retailers and distributors across North America, is working toward getting industry-friendly regulation at the state level.

Half of US states permit hemp-derived delta-9 THC beverages as of May 1, according to the HBA. The rest either severely limit THC content in these drinks, prohibit their sale outright or have not regulated the product, by the HBA‚Äôs count.

An uncertain future As states decide how to move forward, the federal government could crack down or make hemp illegal again.

‚ÄúIf the FDA starts getting increased accounts of, let‚Äôs say, kids getting ahold of this stuff, or consumers being misled (or) having adverse reactions,‚Äù it might set its own restrictions, said Bricken, the Husch Blackwell attorney.

Then there‚Äôs the question of the farm bill.

The current legislation has been extended through later this year. But if the administration decides to make hemp illegal in the next farm bill, it would have a chilling effect on the THC beverage industry, said Whitt Steineker, partner at Bradley and co-chair of the law firm‚Äôs cannabis industry team.

‚ÄúYou would see the money flow really dry up,‚Äù he said.

Halper, of Top Ten Liquors, isn‚Äôt quite sure what to expect from the federal government.

‚ÄúWe all talk about the next farm bill,‚Äù he said, adding: ‚ÄúNone of us control what is happening in Washington.‚Äù

I drink out of a 20 oz cup and have the standard aero press. Probably should have gotten the XL, but I didn't know when I ordered.  

Initially I googled a weight ratio (can't remember what it is, but ends up being 2 ish table spoons whole bean then ground for full 20 oz of water) and would brew twice to fill my cup. Brewing 2 times got annoying so what I've been doing is I use 2 tablespoons of coffee  fill the aeropress. Push through and then I just top the cup off with hot water.  So I'm essentially diluting the ""strong"" cup of coffee.  Not sure how effective this is, I'd assume at some point the water would be too saturated with coffee and can't accept any more from the grounds.  

I know there's people that have elaborate processes where if you pour the water counter clockwise it ruins the cup and you just have to throw the aero press away and buy a new one, etc.  so I'm curious how I should go about making a good cup.  What actually matters?  

I have a nice kettle that gets the water to the exact temps, as I heard that was important.  Sometimes after I pour the water into the press I walk away and come back 10 minutes later, while some people have timers they set to not let coffee over steep, etc.  

Really just looking for the things that actually matter when it comes to using the aero press.

My contribution is protein - carbs might be great but theyre mostly empty calories, and I think they'll be the easiest to find, although I do have some protein pastas and bags of white/brown rice. I think fats dont need a focus, because after all this is America and everything already has plenty of that. 

I've found dry bags of beans to be the best bang for the buck, a 4lb bag has sufficient protein for one person for one week, and only costs about $5. The worst thing I've found is canned meats, price wise, but having something thats actually good is important too. 

Last is sauces and soups. I think its important to have something that I actually want to eat, and I can pour a can of soup over a serving of rice and beans, or a can of chicken to get good calories or split up portions between family members. 

I've heard a lot of other items like water, multi vitamins, antibiotics.

Coffee is a must have for me too, so I recently got a few extra cans

I‚Äôve been to quite a few all-inclusives in Mexico and the Caribbean, and while this one was definitely beautiful and relaxing, it wasn‚Äôt¬†*flawless*.

That said, I‚Äôd still give it a solid¬†**8.5 out of 10**.

# Arrival & First Impressions

Right from the get-go, the resort makes a great impression. The drive in is through this long palm-lined road that feels very private. Once we arrived, we were greeted with champagne and cold towels while they handled check-in for us‚Äîsuper easy. The open-air lobby has a very chill, upscale vibe. We both looked at each other and went, ‚ÄúOkay, this is gonna be a good one.‚Äù

# The Room ‚Äì Preferred Club Ocean View Suite

We booked a Preferred Club Ocean View room and honestly, the room was really nice. Huge king bed, sitting area, stocked minibar, and a bathroom with a double sink, big jacuzzi tub, and separate shower.

The balcony had a decent view‚Äînot full oceanfront, more of a peek-through-the-palms situation‚Äîbut it was still a beautiful place to have a morning coffee or late-night glass of wine. Housekeeping was on point and came twice a day, which we appreciated.

# Food & Restaurants ‚Äì Mostly Great

We had some really good meals, and a few that were just okay.

* **Bordeaux (French)**¬†was our favorite‚Äîromantic setting and perfectly cooked steak.
* **El Patio (Mexican)**¬†had great atmosphere and solid tacos and mole.
* **Portofino (Italian)**¬†was kind of forgettable, but the tiramisu was great.
* **Himitsu (Asian)**¬†was fun, especially the teppanyaki show, but food-wise it felt like style over substance.

The breakfast buffet at¬†**World Caf√©**¬†had tons of variety. The made-to-order omelets and smoothie bar were clutch. Room service was 24/7, which we used twice‚Äîonce after a long day at the pool and once for a lazy morning in bed. Both times it was quick and hot.

# Drinks ‚Äì High Quality, Great Bartenders

This place doesn‚Äôt skimp on alcohol quality. Everything is top-shelf, and the bartenders were consistently good across the property. We had a bunch of mojitos and spicy margaritas, and both were great every time.

The lobby bar was our go-to for a pre-dinner drink, and the swim-up bar by the pool kept the party vibe going without being too rowdy. Beach service could be slow depending on how many people were around, but not terrible.

# Beach & Pools ‚Äì Absolutely the Highlight

Maroma Beach is straight-up stunning. Probably one of the best beaches I‚Äôve seen in Mexico. Powdery white sand, calm turquoise water, and not a single rock in sight. Plenty of loungers and palapas, and we never had to fight for chairs‚Äîeven midday.

The pool scene was also awesome. There‚Äôs one main pool that‚Äôs more social and another that‚Äôs more low-key. We spent most of our time at the chill pool just reading and sipping cocktails. Poolside staff brought around snacks and cold towels randomly, which was a really nice touch.

# Entertainment & Activities ‚Äì Relaxed Vibe

There‚Äôs stuff going on every day‚Äîbeach volleyball, cooking classes, live music at night‚Äîbut nothing feels forced. We went to a couple of the evening shows and they were entertaining, not Vegas-level productions, but good fun with a drink in hand. Most nights we just had dinner and then hung out at the lobby bar or walked the beach.

# Spa ‚Äì Total Zen

We splurged on a couples massage at the spa and don‚Äôt regret it one bit. The hydrotherapy circuit they put you through before the massage was surprisingly cool‚Äîlots of different water stations and hot/cold therapies. The massage itself was excellent and the whole vibe in the spa was super calm and peaceful.

# Staff & Service ‚Äì Almost Perfect

The service here was generally excellent. Everyone from the front desk to the bartenders was friendly, helpful, and professional. That said, there were a couple of moments where the service felt slower than it should‚Äôve‚Äîespecially during busy dinner hours. But nothing that ruined the trip.

They also made a sweet effort to decorate our room with rose petals for my girlfriend‚Äôs birthday, which was a great surprise.

# Final Verdict ‚Äì Would I Go Back?

Overall,¬†**Secrets Maroma Beach**¬†is a beautiful, romantic, and well-run resort. The beach and pools are absolute standouts, and the service is mostly top-tier. While the food wasn't 100% consistent across every restaurant, we still had plenty of great meals.

It‚Äôs definitely more laid-back than some other resorts, so if you‚Äôre looking to party hard, this probably isn‚Äôt your scene. But if you're after luxury, peace, and beach bliss, this place is a winner.

Would I go back? Yes‚Äîthough next time I might try a different Secrets or maybe explore another brand just to compare. But we left relaxed, happy, and already craving that beach.

My dead grandpa unfriended me on Facebook. : r/nosleep                          


                        My dead grandpa unfriended me on Facebook.
Hi everyone. I'm a little weirded out by something, and I could use a little advice. My grandpa has been dead for about ten years, but before he died he made a Facebook account. I never unfriended him, because it felt like I still had a connection with him as long as I could go back and read our old conversations. Well, a few weeks ago I noticed my Friends count had gone down by two. I never had many Facebook friends, so I knew it had to be two of my close friends or relatives who unfriended me. Eventually I realized it had to be grandpa and grandma. I thought maybe Facebook had closed grandpa's account because he had been dead for so long, but... That didn't explain grandma. Also, I could still find both of them by searching for their names. I don't know why, but I tried adding both of them again. Almost immediately, the option to add grandpa returned, so I know my request was Ignored. The request to add grandma remained pending for a few hours, but eventually that one was Ignored too. All this is a little besides the point, and more detailed than you probably care about, but I need to tell someone, because it's all still really strange to me, and I wanted to tell the whole story. My grandmother is still alive. I don't visit her as often as I should, maybe a few times a year... She is not very tech savvy, but she's on Facebook once or twice a month, and after a few hours of painstakingly guiding her through online banking, she's even managed to start paying her bills online. But other than that, Facebook is about the most complicated 'computer thing' she can handle. I asked my mother, and she checked her own account. She had been unfriended as well. She about had a small meltdown when she called grandma and she didn't pick up. I live pretty close to my mother, so she came and picked me up, and we drove to grandmother's house. It's only an hour away. Really there is no excuse for visiting her as seldom as we do. Grandma was home, and she was happy to see us. When my mother demanded to know why she hadn't picked up the phone, she said she had been to grandpa's grave. She didn't seem to think mother had any reason to be upset, but she invited us in and asked if we wanted to stay for dinner or coffee. We decided to remain for a few hours. As I said, we really should have visited her more often, and every time we visit it's clear grandma likes having us... We feel guilty about it when we're there for once, but life moves pretty quickly, and there is always something else we need to do. My grandma has an old piano. I'm not very musically inclined, but it's very nostalgic for me to hear mother and grandma play on that piano. Which they did, as they always do when we visit. It felt good. It felt normal. So I told myself she had probably just had an old person moment and logged into grandpa's account for some reason. But I was still curious, so I did ask her during dinner. She looked embarrassed, but she said she just did not feel like using facebook anymore, so she had tried to close her account. We said the accounts were still open though, but she waved it away. We finished dinner and helped her with a few things around the house. She was happy to have us there, and again, everything felt normal. Eventually we went home. A few weeks passed. My mom and I both called grandma once or twice, and everything still seemed normal. But late one night last week I decided to look my grandparents up on Facebook again. The profile pictures had changed. Grandma used to change hers every now and then, and the new ones didn't look unusual, but... Grandma said she' stopped using Facebook. And there was no reason at all for grandpa's account to have a new picture. I brought it up with my mother the next day, and she had that same feeling as I did that... something was off. We went to visit grandma again yesterday. She was glad to see us like always. In fact she seemed happier than she had been in a long time. We asked her about Facebook again, and she said she hadn't been on it. When we mentioned the profile pictures changing she said maybe she'd been on there once or twice. She didn't want to talk about it, so we let it drop. We helped her with a few chores around the house again, but... this time my curiosity was stronger, so I made sure I had an excuse to go into her bedroom while she was in the kitchen with mother, and I turned on her computer. I know all her passwords, because she never changes them, and she has them all written down on a little note next to her laptop. It was a cheap piece of crap the day we bought it for her half a decade ago, but she only uses it for very basic things like writing about her childhood (She lives out in the middle of nowhere, and she grew up in a retirement home in the 1930s, so she knows more about the area and people who used to live there than pretty much anyone). But... she had a Tor browser. She's not stupid, my grandma, but she's always been very, very bad at computing, like a lot of old people. So this surprised me. Even my parents probably don't even know what Tor browsers are used for, so my grandma definitely shouldn't. Hell, I don't even know that much. Only time I ever used one was when I was looking into the Darknet back in the day, and that was a very brief and shallow visit. I clicked on Tor, and it opened up to a normal search engine. No bookmarks, no browsing history, nothing. Considering she was in the habit of writing all her account names and passwords down on post notes and leaving them by the computer, I figured she probably didn't use Tor. I closed it, opened up her regular browser and went to Facebook. She was logged in. She had unfriended everyone. Everyone, except grandpa. And this is what creeps me out. There were posts on both her and grandpa's timelines going back to the day she had unfriended everyone. Some posts were from his account, the rest from hers. They replied to each other. It looked like real conversations. Grandma would sometimes take minutes to reply, sometimes hours, but grandpa's replies were all almost instantaneous. There were old pictures of them back when they were younger. From back before digital cameras even. I suppose it's possible grandma might have learned how to scan photos, or paid someone to do it for her, but... Why would she fake conversations with her dead husband? I was starting to worry something was seriously wrong with grandma. I took a few photos of the screen with my phone, then I went out into the kitchen. I joined the conversation for a little bit, then whispered to mom and told her to go into the bedroom while I talked to grandma. I kept her busy for around twenty minutes until mom came back. She looked a little pale, so she must have found the whole thing as creepy as I did. But now what? We didn't know what to do. I sneaked back to grandma's bedroom with the intention to turn her laptop off before she noticed we'd turned it on at all. But then I saw there was a new message waiting for her. From my grandpa. I opened the chat window, and it read: Have Angie and Charlie already left? My mother's name is Angela, so Angie isn't that strange as a nickname, but nobody calls me Charlie except my grandparents. Charles is my middle name, and most people don't even know I have one. So I was a little bit disturbed that someone was calling me that when talking to my grandmother using her dead husband's account. I took a photo of that as well, then closed the browser and turned her laptop off. My mother and I said our goodbyes and left. Everything about my grandma's behaviour seemed normal, and she was sad to see us go like always... But I know for a fact that it couldn't be her who had written that message, since she had been in the kitchen the whole time. This happened yesterday, and I have no idea what's going on. It feels wrong. I mean, I know something is clearly off, but I have no idea what it could be. How do I even look into this more? Do we just confront grandma about this? I have no idea where to turn. So, if anyone here has any ideas, please, I'm completely in the dark.I didn‚Äôt sleep much that night. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that message again‚Äî‚ÄúHave Angie and Charlie already left?‚Äù I hadn‚Äôt told anyone we were visiting Grandma. Mom hadn‚Äôt either. Nobody calls me Charlie except my grandparents, and barely anyone even knows that‚Äôs my middle name. So how could someone, pretending to be Grandpa, know that detail unless it was... actually him? The next morning, I felt sick from lack of sleep. I decided to do something I hadn‚Äôt done since I was a teenager‚ÄîI dug through old voicemail recordings I‚Äôd saved on an external drive. I found a few from Grandpa. Just hearing his voice again made my chest tighten, but I compared them‚Äîcarefully‚Äîto the voice in that Facebook message. They were the same. Every pause, every vocal tick, even that slight wheeze he used to get when he breathed in. I wasn‚Äôt ready to jump to supernatural conclusions, but I also couldn‚Äôt explain it. Deepfakes were a possibility, but Grandma? She still struggles to understand why her email has a ‚Äúspam‚Äù folder. There was no way she figured out how to use AI tools sophisticated enough to recreate a dead man‚Äôs voice... right? I called Mom and told her everything. She was quiet for a long time, then said something I hadn‚Äôt even considered: ‚ÄúWhat if she‚Äôs not alone?‚Äù The idea hadn‚Äôt crossed my mind, but once she said it, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it. The way Grandma brushed off questions. The new profile pictures. The Tor browser. All of it added up to something deeper, stranger, and potentially more dangerous than just an old woman playing pretend online.That evening, Mom and I agreed to go back one more time. Not just to visit‚Äîbut to look. Really look. Grandma was cheerful when we arrived. She greeted us like always, acted  like everything was fine. She even baked a pie. I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was an act or if she really believed everything was normal. But once again, I noticed small things out of place. Two coffee cups in the sink. A coat hanging by the door I‚Äôd never seen before. And muddy footprints just inside the back porch, too large to be hers. We didn‚Äôt ask questions right away. We stayed for dinner, played a song or two on the piano, even laughed a little. But the tension was thick, and when Grandma excused herself to go to the bathroom, I gave Mom a look. She nodded, and we both quietly moved toward the hallway. We weren‚Äôt sure what we were expecting, but it wasn‚Äôt what we found. I didn‚Äôt accept the friend request.Instead, I messaged Mom and told her everything I‚Äôd found. The audio files, the folder labeled ‚ÄúEcho,‚Äù the friend request from Grandpa‚Äôs new account. It was late, but we both agreed‚Äîwe needed to go back to Grandma‚Äôs house. Together. Something wasn‚Äôt right, and it was getting worse. We drove there early the next morning, just after sunrise. The house looked calm, quiet. The yard was the same as always‚Äîneatly trimmed, bird feeders swinging gently in the wind‚Äîbut something felt wrong the moment we stepped onto the porch. The curtains in the front window were drawn shut. That had never been the case.We knocked. No answer. Knocked again‚Äîstill nothing. Mom tried calling, but it went straight to voicemail. Then, almost by instinct, I reached out and turned the doorknob. It was unlocked.The moment we stepped inside, we both froze. There were two coffee mugs on the table. One with lipstick on the rim‚ÄîGrandma‚Äôs. The other was unfamiliar. Bigger, chipped, and stained inside. There was a pair of boots by the door that definitely didn‚Äôt belong to her, and a leather jacket slung over the back of the recliner. Mom whispered, ‚ÄúShe has someone here.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs when we heard it‚Äîfootsteps. Heavy ones. Coming from the back hallway.I grabbed Mom‚Äôs hand and pulled her quietly toward the kitchen. We ducked behind the counter as the footsteps moved into the living room. A man‚Äôs voice, low and gravelly, called out, ‚ÄúElaine? I thought you said you were alone today.‚Äù Grandma‚Äôs voice, distant, replied from somewhere down the hall, ‚ÄúI was. Maybe they just stopped by.‚ÄùWe didn‚Äôt wait. We ran back to the front door and burst outside. Only once we were in the car did we realize we‚Äôd left the USB stick back at my house, but we weren‚Äôt thinking straight. Mom was shaking. I was trying not to.She called the police as we drove. It took them less than twenty minutes to arrive. We waited at the end of the driveway, watching. Grandma came out with a pleasant smile as the officers approached. She acted confused. Like she didn‚Äôt understand why we were worried. Said there was no one else in the house. But when the police asked to look around, she hesitated. Argued. They insisted.And that‚Äôs when it all fell apart.The man was hiding in the basement. He tried to run but didn‚Äôt get far before they caught him. He was maybe fifty‚Äîunkempt, gray-bearded, and angry. In the basement, behind a locked storage door, they found something else. Evidence. Photos of Grandma and Grandpa. Old love letters. A rotting suitcase full of bones.It wasn‚Äôt a question anymore. Grandpa didn‚Äôt die of a heart attack like we were told. She‚Äôd killed him.The man in the basement was her boyfriend. A drifter she‚Äôd met online two years ago. They‚Äôd used his voice, his tech skills, to create those messages. Used AI, audio deep fakes, stolen photos. They were pretending Grandpa was still alive online‚Äîtalking to her, posting pictures‚Äîto keep up the illusion for family. And maybe, in a way, for herself.When we asked why, she smiled.‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to be alone.‚ÄùThe scariest part? She didn‚Äôt seem sorry.

On Isabella Bennett's birthday, she waited all night. But Dominic Hinton never returned.  
  
His first love Chloe Winslow was marrying the infamous playboy in their circle today.  
  
He couldn't bare her ruin her life and rush off to stop the wedding.  
  
With swollen eyes, she sat alone in the living room all night. By morning, she received a call from an unfamiliar number.  
  
""Isabella Bennett, marry me.""  
  
Hearing that nonchalant tone, Isabella instantly pictured the man of cynicism. The very playboy Dominic's precious Chloe was supposed to marry.  
  
""Lucas Montgomery?""  
  
""Your fianc√© stole my bride,"" Lucas laughed with mischief. ""So I'm here to steal his. Fair's fair, right?""  
  
Isabella fell silent for a moment, then shook her head slightly. ""Seems fair enough.""  
  
On the other end, Lucas arched an eyebrow and said confidently.  
  
""Perfect. I'll arrange another wedding in fifteen days. Get yourself a dress and wait for me to marry you.""  
  
Then the line went dead.  
  
Isabella stared at the cold dinner spread across the table, tears suddenly welling in her eyes.  
  
She never imagined that after all these years of waiting, she'd finally received a proposal.  
  
But the proposal wasn't from Dominic. The groom wasn't Dominic.  
  
And the man she'd be marrying wasn't Dominic either.  
  
...  
  
Isabella had known Dominic for ten years. And she had fallen hard for him at first sight.  
  
It was at the opening ceremony of their first year of high school. Dominic stood at the podium as the student representative.  
  
Sunlight filtered through the hall's floor-to-ceiling windows, casting a golden halo around his sharply defined profile.  
  
Girls throughout the auditorium whispered excitedly as they snuck photos.  
  
But Isabella just stood in the shadows at the back of the hall.  
  
Back then, Dominic was the golden boy of the high school.  
  
Always top of his class, winning gold medals in competitions, even the way he rolled up his sleeves playing basketball exuded that subtle hint of cedar cologne‚Äîevery gesture screaming old money and privilege.  
  
She was different worlds apart from him, just an ordinary scholarship student.  
  
And this boy that every girl in school worshipped? His eyes only ever followed one person.  
  
Chloe Winslow, his childhood sweetheart.  
  
Isabella had witnessed him organizing Chloe's notes in the library, seen him drape his jacket over Chloe when she got caught in the rain, watched him search the entire city for a limited-edition CD Chloe had casually mentioned.  
  
Later, she heard their families were old friends with an arranged marriage in the works.  
  
Then came the summer after graduation, news broke that the Hinton Group had collapsed overnight.  
  
The same Mr. Hinton who once drove a Rolls-Royce to parent-teacher conferences had jumped from the Hinton tower.  
  
The next day, Chloe flew off to France.  
  
Dominic was left alone to shoulder the immense debt, working tirelessly every day to repay it. His life became a blur of exhaustion and despair.  
  
That night, Isabella found Dominic passed out drunk in an alley behind a bar.  
  
His expensive shirt was wrinkled and his eyes bloodshot‚Äîlike an abandoned dog.  
  
She crouched down to help him. But he grabbed her wrist, the stench of alcohol and blood hitting her face.  
  
""Who the fuck are you?""  
  
""Isabella Bennett,"" she whispered. ""We go to the same school. You probably don't remember...""  
  
He didn't remember at all.  
  
But he let her take him home anyway.  
  
That night, Dominic was like a feral animal. He pinned her to the narrow bed in her tiny studio apartment and kissed her until her lips went numb.  
  
Later, she knew that just thirty minutes before she found him, Chloe had updated her Instagram‚Äî  
  
A photo showing her kissing her new boyfriend beneath the Eiffel Tower.  
  
The next morning, Dominic offered to take responsibility for her.  
  
Eventually, he moved into her cramped 200-square-foot studio. They held each other for warmth, surviving the toughest days together.  
  
But Isabella knew, even though she'd rescued this fallen prince, his heart was never truly hers.  
  
He never forgot Chloe.  
  
She'd caught him staring at Chloe's photos in the middle of the night, watched him eat nothing but sandwich for three straight months to save for a plane ticket to Paris, seen him rush out the door on her birthday after receiving a text from Chloe.  
  
Yet she remained hopelessly devoted.  
  
She stayed up with him revising his resume, accompanied him as he dropped off job applications door-to-door, faced off with debt collectors.  
  
During their toughest times, she secretly sold the only gold ring her mother had left her, just to buy him a decent suit for interviews.  
  
Eventually, he started remembering she liked sugar in her coffee. He would text her to remind her to eat dinner while she worked late and gently drape a coat over her when she fell asleep.  
  
She thought she'd finally thawed his frozen heart.  
  
Meanwhile, he rose from the ashes, becoming once again the darling prince of high society.  
  
Just when everything seemed to be heading in the right direction, Chloe returned from France.  
  
And everything went back to square one.  
  
He'd race his car to the airport at midnight to pick her up.  
  
He‚Äôd throw a welcome-back party for her like nothing ever happened.  
  
And the moment he heard she was getting married? He dropped everything to crash it without hesitation.  
  
Seven years Isabella had given him everything, and still it couldn't compete with Chloe's simple ""I'm back.""  
  
Finally, she was exhausted. Her love had run dry.  
  
Isabella stood up and started packing.  
  
One by one, everything went into garbage bags.  
  
The trash truck happened to pull up just then. She watched as workers tossed her bags onto the truck‚Äîalong with seven years of foolish dreams.  
  
""What are you throwing away?""  
  
The front door suddenly swung open, and Dominic's voice came from behind her.  
  
Isabella didn't turn around, her voice eerily calm. ""Just some useless shit.‚Äù  
  
Then she looked up at him. ""Just cleaning the house. Got rid of things that didn‚Äôt matter anymore.‚Äù  
  
Those few simple words made Dominic's expression change instantly. He shoved her aside and charged into the house.  
  
""Who the hell gave you permission to touch my things?!""  
  
He ransacked the place, his face growing darker by the second.  
  
After tearing apart the entire study without finding what he was looking for, he bolted outside.  
  
As they passed each other, Dominic accidentally knocked Isabella down.  
  
She stumbled, smashing her forehead against the doorframe. Blood immediately streamed down her face.  
  
Worried he'd lost something important, she didn't even stop to treat her wound before rushing after him.  
  
Then she witnessed the most absurd scene of her life‚Äî  
  
Dominic Hinton, the same man with severe germaphobia‚Äîwas on his knees in a pile of garbage, frantically digging through trash.  
  
Seeing his desperation, guilt welled up inside her.  
  
‚ÄúThe trash truck already took everything. It‚Äôs at the dump by now. I swear, it was all mine‚ÄîI probably mixed in some of your stuff by accident. I‚Äôm... I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù  
  
Only then did Dominic notice her injury.  
  
He froze and reached toward her face, then pulled back. ""I was in a hurry. I didn‚Äôt mean to.""  
  
Once they were both in the car, Isabella finally asked. ""What did you lose? Was it important?""  
  
Dominic gripped the steering wheel tightly. He was quiet for a long time.  
  
‚ÄúIt was a necklace. I used to send it out for cleaning every month.‚Äù  
  
Isabella‚Äôs breath caught, tears welling in her eyes.  
  
That necklace was the token Dominic and Chloe had exchanged when they got engaged.  
  
No wonder he was so desperate.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
The tension inside the car thickened into silence.  
  
Dominic noticed her shift in mood. He knewthere was no hiding the wedding incident from her, so he offered a half-hearted explanation.  
  
""Before Chloe's grandfather died, I promised him I'd look after her. You know Lucas Montgomery. If Chloe married him, her life would be ruined. That's why I had to stop the wedding.""  
  
These were just empty excuses to pacify Isabella.  
  
The real reason he crashed the wedding was because he still had feelings for Chloe and couldn't stand watching her marry someone else.  
  
And his desperate search for that necklace, a token that hadn‚Äôt meant anything legally for years‚Äîwas because deep down, he believed he should be the one marrying Chloe.  
  
The thought twisted something sharp inside Isabella.  
  
She turned her face toward the window, letting the tears fall silently.  
  
""Well, Lucas has found someone new. He won't be bothering Chloe anymore. You can relax.""  
  
Hearing her confident tone, Dominic's brow furrowed. ‚ÄúLucas found someone new? Who told you that?‚Äù  
  
Isabella was about to tell him that she was the bride.  
  
But just then, his jarring ringtone cut through the car.  
  
The moment he answered, Chloe's sob came through the line.  
  
""Dominic, my parents are furious I ran off. They're making me kneel and threatening corporal punishment. I‚Äôm gonna die in there! What should I do?""  
  
""I'm coming right now!"" he barked.  
  
He hung up quickly and turned to Isabella. ""Isabella, something's come up. Can you go look for the necklace first?""  
  
Isabella opened her mouth, but no sound came out.  
  
She nodded silently. Then she opened the car door and stepped out alone.  
  
After watching his car disappear into the darkness, she hailed a Uber to the dump.  
  
The garbage truck had already emptied its load. Looking at mountains of trash under the dim lights, she rolled up her sleeves.  
  
Fighting through the stench, she spent five grueling hours before finding her discarded things.  
  
After turning every box upside down, she still couldn't find the necklace.  
  
Then the housekeeper called.  
  
""Miss Bennett, we found the necklace. It was under Mr. Hinton's pillow. Must‚Äôve slipped there while he was sleeping.‚Äù  
  
Isabella let out a bitter laugh.  
  
How deep must his love be to sleep with that necklace, holding onto memories even in his dreams?  
  
And they'd shared that same bed every night, yet she'd never noticed.  
  
Night had fallen completely. With no taxis in the remote area, she had to walk home.  
  
Dawn was breaking, her feet bloodied and legs swollen, when she finally reached the house.  
  
She'd left in such a hurry she'd forgotten her keys. Too tired to even knock, she leaned against the door and passed out.  
  
Some time later, Isabella was awakened by someone.  
  
Still groggy, she opened her eyes to see Dominic's assistant standing over her. He was clearly anxious.  
  
""Miss Bennett, Mr. Hinton is in trouble. Please come to the hospital right away!""  
  
Isabella's mind was foggy, unable to process what was happening before being pulled into a car.  
  
The cold autumn wind brought her back to her senses, and she finally thought to ask what had happened.  
  
The assistant looked uneasy, hesitating before pulling out his phone to show her a video.  
  
""Mr. Hinton went to the Winslow estate yesterday. He offered to take Miss Winslow's punishment. They gave him one hundred lashes. He passed out afterward and was taken to the hospital.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
In the video, Isabella watched as the man who once would rather lose a hand to loan sharks than drop to his knees‚Äîwas now on his knees before Chloe's parents, taking the punishment meant for her.  
  
Blood soaked through his shirt, wounds crisscrossed and torn open.  
  
Each strike of the whip seemed to land on Isabella‚Äôs chest, leaving her gasping for air.  
  
The assistant parked the car and escorted her to the hospital room.  
  
The room wasn‚Äôt fully shut. Isabella could hear Chloe's sobs from inside.  
  
""Dominic, you're so stupid. I left you alone and go to France. You should hate me. Why crash my wedding? Why the hell would you take the punishment for me?‚Äù  
  
Dominic lay on the hospital bed, his voice weak but filled with tenderness.  
  
‚ÄúI did hate you, right after you left. But as time passed, I was just... grateful.""  
  
""I love you, and I didn‚Äôt want you living in my shitty studio apartment, eating nothing but bread and pickles, working part-time jobs till you passed out from low blood sugar... You made the right choice.""  
  
Hearing his explanation, Chloe sobbed harder. Then she threw herself into his arms.  
  
""So you've forgiven me, right? You crashed the wedding because you still love me, right? My parents said if you took my punishment, you'd have to agree to marry me. You said yes, didn‚Äôt you?""  
  
Each desperate question hit Isabella like a sledgehammer, leaving her numb from head to toe.  
  
Dominic agreed to marry Chloe?  
  
Then she saw him nod. That was the final crack that shattered what was left of her already ruined heart.  
  
The phone slipped from her hand, clattering on the floor.  
  
After what felt like an eternity, Isabella picked up her phone and turned to leave.  
  
But just as she reached the stairwell, Chloe caught up and grabbed her arm.  
  
""Isabella,"" Chloe smirked, ""I know you saw everything. Dominic never forgot me. You spent seven years suffering with him. But I set up one little trap, and he came running to crash my wedding.""  
  
""Dominic‚Äôs never stopped loving me. You really thought you could win against me?‚Äù  
  
In that moment, Isabella finally understood‚Äîmarrying Lucas had been Chloe's strategy all along.  
  
All to lure Dominic into crashing the wedding.  
  
Chloe's parents were probably in on it too, using the punishment to force Dominic to agree to marry her.  
  
Now that Dominic had power and status again, of course they wanted the engagement back.  
  
The realization made Isabella laugh bitterly.  
  
""He loves you so much. And you still played him like that. Doesn't that make you a little bit ashamed?""  
  
Hearing her words, Chloe's face twisted into an expression of disbelief.  
  
‚ÄúPlayed him? What exactly did I ‚Äòplay‚Äô? Whether it was crashing the wedding, taking my punishment, or agreeing to marry me‚ÄîI never forced him to do anything.""  
  
""He did it all willingly! He loves me enough to sacrifice everything. That's something you'll never have, sweetie.""  
  
Every word hit Isabella like a slap across the face.  
  
She couldn‚Äôt even deny it. Because Chloe was right.  
  
‚ÄúYes, he made his choice. And I respect it. Don't worry, I'm stepping aside. You two enjoy yourselves.‚Äù

No flash. No sound. Just a moment where the moon, a battered, cratered Esshar mining satellite called Lurek-7‚Äîexisted, and the next moment it was gone. In its place, a fan-shaped cloud of molten rock and vaporized ore spiraled out into the vacuum, the remnants of the moon atomized by a kinetic impact no one saw coming.

Well almost no one.

Someone had caught the footage. A mining drone, half-dead and on backup power, had been recording a survey loop just as an object‚Äîlater measured to be approximately 1.4 kilometers in diameter‚Äîentered the system at a significant fraction of lightspeed and impacted dead-center on Lurek-7. The impact‚Äôs energy rating was classified, but the aftershock reached sensors four systems away.

It was not long before the Galactic Confederation High Council called an emergency session.

Held on neutral ground‚Äîthe moon Denvos-4, which hosted a sprawling diplomatic station with only three confirmed assassination attempts in the last two years‚Äîit was deemed secure enough for a face-to-face. Nobody trusted long-range holographics since the ‚ÄúFacial Swapper Incident‚Äù that had led to two hours of negotiation with a rogue AI disguised as the Volari chancellor.

Delegates from across the Confederation filed into the Great Hall of Accord, many in full regalia. The Krelian fleet admirals wore pressure-armor ceremonial plating. The Jeljians floated in on anti-grav cushions wreathed in bio-light. The Esshar arrived early, in silence, except for the rhythmic click-click of their leg-joints echoing ominously through the chamber. Their delegation was larger than usual. Not a good sign.

The session was already underway when the humans arrived.

Ten minutes late.

Their diplomat, Ambassador Mallory, led the group, a woman in her forties by human reckoning, wearing a wrinkled diplomatic tunic over what looked like running shoes. Her hair was tied in a loose bun, and she held a steaming beverage in a metallic travel mug that read: If You Can Read This, I Haven‚Äôt Had My Coffee Yet.

Behind her trailed two aides. One was chewing gum.

Mallory slid into her assigned seat with all the grace of someone showing up for a PTA meeting. She leaned into the mic. ‚ÄúSo, we heard someone lost a moon. Super awkward.‚Äù

Across the chamber, the Esshar ambassador rose so quickly his translator panel pinged with a cautionary tone. His mandibles flared, his voice sizzled through the speakers like a power short. ‚ÄúThis is an act of war. A war crime! You launched a relativistic projectile across six systems and obliterated sovereign Esshar territory!‚Äù

Mallory blinked. ‚ÄúAre you sure? That seems like a really‚Ä¶ deliberate thing to do. You‚Äôre saying we meant to shoot your moon?‚Äù

The Esshar ambassador's tendrils writhed. ‚ÄúThe object was traced to a human-controlled sector. The trajectory aligns precisely. Your‚Ä¶ device‚Äîyour so-called ‚ÄòGRAD‚Äô‚Äîwas the source. We demand immediate sanctions. This is a clear deployment of a banned Class-Z kinetic bombardment system!‚Äù

The room went still. Class-Z was the big one. Reserved for planet-crackers, black-hole projectors, and hypernova-induction arrays.

Mallory took a slow sip of her drink. ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs a bit of a misunderstanding. GRAD isn‚Äôt a weapon. GRAD stands for Geo-Relativistic Adjustment Device. It‚Äôs a civilian-operated system designed for deep-space geological reshaping. Terraforming. Mining. That sort of thing.‚Äù

There was a beat of silence.

‚ÄúGeo... what?‚Äù the Krelian ambassador asked.

‚ÄúAdjustment,‚Äù Mallory said brightly. ‚ÄúThe system‚Äôs whole purpose is to safely redirect large asteroids or break up dead moons for mineral access. It‚Äôs a glorified rail launcher. No AI targeting. No warheads. Just physics and magnetism. Think of it as a big orbital rock pusher.‚Äù

The Esshar ambassador made a noise like a blender trying to eat a spoon. ‚ÄúIt vaporized a moon.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Mallory said, frowning into her cup, ‚Äúthat moon was right in the path of an asteroid we were redirecting for planetary crust enrichment in Sector 38-G. It‚Äôs not our fault someone parked a satellite there without proper system notifications. We filed a full spatial redirection notice with the GC two months ago.‚Äù

Chaos erupted.

GC legal aides were already tapping furiously into the treaty databases. Treaty 47-C, Subsection 9 forbade deployment of ‚Äúsuperweapons‚Äù capable of destructive yields beyond 5 planetary megatons. But it defined ‚Äúweapon‚Äù as a system ‚Äúexpressly intended for hostile action.‚Äù

Mallory was ready. ‚ÄúGRAD isn‚Äôt intended for hostile action. It‚Äôs just geology. Space geology. And technically, it‚Äôs operated by a private consortium of engineers, not the human government.‚Äù

The Jeljian delegate raised one of her tendrils. ‚ÄúIs it true that the device‚Äôs hull is painted with an open mouth and sharp teeth, and that it bears the name Yeet Cannon Mk II?‚Äù

Mallory looked sheepish. ‚ÄúEngineers. What can you do?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeet?‚Äù the Volari diplomat asked.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ an old Earth word for throwing something very hard. At something else.‚Äù

A low murmur swept the chamber.

The Chair of the High Council, a dignified entity made of overlapping crystalline rings, finally tapped the gavel. ‚ÄúThis council will recess to review the footage and technical records of the GRAD system.‚Äù

Ambassador Mallory rose, gathering her tablet and mug. ‚ÄúMight want to get a big screen,‚Äù she said casually. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a fun replay.‚Äù

She and her aides exited without another word. One of them, as they passed the Krelian delegation, offered a chipper ‚ÄúHave a great day!‚Äù and a wink.

Back in the chamber, the High Council sat in tense silence, preparing to watch a moon get murdered by physics and plausible deniability.

A week before the moon ceased to exist, the GRAD design team was arguing about orbital ethics in a prefab command trailer duct-taped to the side of an asteroid.

‚ÄúWe need a failsafe,‚Äù said Gentry, lead propulsion engineer and amateur guitar player. ‚ÄúSome way to make sure we don‚Äôt accidentally launch one of these rocks at a habitat ring. A checklist. Or a targeting lockout.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou want a targeting lockout on a system designed specifically to launch things at targets?‚Äù replied Vani, who‚Äôd been awake for 36 hours and was currently using a broken wrench as a hair clip.

‚ÄúI want to not vaporize a kindergarten dome, Vani.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook,‚Äù said Tanner, the systems manager, ‚Äújust don‚Äôt aim at inhabited systems. Done.‚Äù

There was a long pause.

‚ÄúDo any of you know where the inhabited systems are?‚Äù Vani asked.

They looked at one another.

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt there a database or something?‚Äù Tanner tried. ‚ÄúLike a... list?‚Äù

‚ÄúI have a list,‚Äù said another engineer from across the lab, raising a coffee-stained printout titled: Top Ten Least Explodable Trajectories.

None of them had actually read it.

Eventually, the final funding packet from EarthGov came through with a single line of conditional approval:

‚ÄúProceed with planetary mass driver project. Just don‚Äôt name it something stupid.‚Äù

That line was, of course, ignored.

They named it Yeet Cannon Mk II within twelve minutes of first ignition.

Back on Denvos-4, the High Council chamber had been dimmed. The playback screen descended like a warship's hull, hanging above the circular diplomatic floor. Everyone sat silently, the entire assembly reduced to expectant murmurs and rustling diplomatic cloaks.

A blinking play symbol hovered on screen.

‚ÄúBegin footage,‚Äù the GC Chair announced.

The chamber filled with raw sensor data. GRAD came into view‚Äîan enormous ring-shaped structure orbiting a dead star, rotating slowly. Dozens of stabilizers glowed with blue ion pulses. Cameras caught the armature aligning as a mountainous asteroid was shuttled into position.

A low hum filled the room as the launch sequence started. Magnetic fields built to impossible densities. Lightning crackled along the superstructure. Then‚Äî

WHAM.

The asteroid launched.

There was no fanfare. No war cry. Just the silent, impossible grace of mass accelerating toward obliteration. The next frames showed the projectile streaking across six systems, captured by automated relay buoys. The footage cut to Lurek-7, spinning in lazy orbit over an Esshar mining colony.

One second: moon.
Next second: not moon.

The impact was like watching a continent-sized hammer fall through a bubble of milk. The resulting debris wave sent flares across local space. The screen flickered, then went silent‚Äîuntil a human voice, slightly tinny, came through the comms log.

‚Äú...whoops.‚Äù

A few diplomats gasped. Someone choked on their tea.

The screen went dark.

The silence afterward was immense. Even the chair‚Äôs translator node flickered as if struggling to articulate the mood.

That‚Äôs when Intelligence Officer Mewlis stood up.

He was short, wore a plain grey uniform, and had the general vibe of someone who always knew more than you and found that fact amusing.

‚ÄúEsteemed delegates,‚Äù he began, ‚Äúthis is‚Ä¶ not the first incident involving the GRAD system.‚Äù

Chairs shifted. Eyestalks swiveled.

‚ÄúThree months ago, a rogue asteroid in the Vel-tar Drift altered its course at unnatural speed. Two months before that, a barren planetoid in the Ythul Expanse was struck so precisely it revealed a previously inaccessible core of rare metals. In both cases, humanity filed routine ‚Äòterraforming adjustment‚Äô reports.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saying these were tests?‚Äù the Jeljian envoy asked.

Mewlis didn‚Äôt smile. But his voice did. ‚ÄúThe probability is high. Extremely high. This may represent a long-term kinetic experimentation program under‚Ä¶ diplomatic camouflage.‚Äù

The Esshar ambassador exploded‚Äîfiguratively.

‚ÄúThis is madness! They have turned a civilian project into a system-class weapon! We demand the immediate disarmament and decommissioning of GRAD, and we will file formal war crimes charges unless the Council acts!‚Äù

All attention turned to Mallory.

She was already halfway through her second mug of coffee and had kicked her shoes off under the desk.

‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt use a megastructure,‚Äù she said with a slow shrug. ‚ÄúWe built a helpful civic project. If someone happened to leave a moon in the way, well, that‚Äôs not on us.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour engineers named it Yeet Cannon!‚Äù the Esshar ambassador shrieked.

‚ÄúI believe we submitted it as Geo-Relativistic Adjustment Device,‚Äù Mallory corrected smoothly. ‚ÄúWhich, I‚Äôll point out, is classified under planetary development tools, not weapons platforms.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou obliterated a moon!‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean, it was barely attached to anything important. We checked... Afterward.‚Äù

Gasps. Hisses. Clicking mandibles. A few muffled chuckles.

‚ÄúAnd frankly,‚Äù Mallory continued, standing, ‚Äúif the Council wants, we‚Äôd be happy to contract GRAD for peaceful operations. You know‚Äîplanetary beautification. Orbit clearing. Discreet terraforming. For a fee.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre renting it out?‚Äù someone croaked.

Mallory smiled. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a very entrepreneurial species.‚Äù

The chamber descended into chaos.

Some factions shouted for sanctions. Others demanded an independent commission. One particularly ruthless trade bloc whispered about hiring the humans for‚Ä¶ ‚Äúhypothetical orbital adjustments‚Äù in systems conveniently close to Esshar space.

Mallory tapped her wristpad.

‚ÄúLooks like we‚Äôve already got the next rock loaded,‚Äù she said aloud, to no one in particular. ‚ÄúHope everyone stays out of the lane.‚Äù

She turned and strolled out, shoes still off, humming what sounded suspiciously like Flight of the Valkyries.",2,1746891500.0,OpenHFY,1,1.0,False

Rated at 4.2 stars and boasting over 62,000 reviews, I had high expectations for this countertop blender. With a 700-watt motor, a sleek black glass jar design, and twelve blending functions, it seemed ready to tackle everything I threw at it‚Äîfrom icy fruit smoothies on hot afternoons to pureed soups for dinner gatherings. However, like all appliances, it came with its fair share of surprises‚Äîsome pleasant, others less so.

**Sleek and Practical Design**  
The look and build of this blender are genuinely pleasant. It's not oversized or bulky, measuring a compact 8.66""D x 8.5""W x 14.69""H. Sitting on my counter, it doesn‚Äôt scream for attention but still manages to look sharp with its shiny black finish and glass jar‚Äîa 40-ounce container that adds a nice premium feel. I also loved the pouring spout‚Äîit‚Äôs a small thing, but the lack of drips or spills while transferring my blended green juice into glasses made a big difference. Small touches like these make everyday use so convenient.

**Blending Performance that Packs a Punch**  
This blender knows its job when it comes to crushing ingredients. Equipped with stainless steel Ice Sabre blades and Hamilton Beach‚Äôs patented Wave Action system, it tackles frozen fruit and ice cubes with surprising finesse. The system keeps everything circulating into the blades, ensuring an even consistency without chunks. I‚Äôve made creamy hummus, thick milkshakes, and fluffy pancake batter‚Äîall to smooth perfection. That said, I noticed it falters slightly with hard ingredients like nuts; you‚Äôll need to give it extra time for proper blending.

**Merits**  
- Thorough blending performance from the Wave Action system.  
- Handles ice and smoothies effortlessly.  
- Dishwasher-safe glass components are easy to clean.  

**Control and Functionality**  
The control panel is refreshingly straightforward. With just five buttons operating twelve blending functions, it skips the complicated bells and whistles found in competing blenders. However, the labeling for the buttons could be more intuitive‚Äîit‚Äôs easy to misinterpret the functions initially. But once you get used to it, you‚Äôll appreciate how one button can efficiently crush ice while another creates the creamiest puree. Still, for a gadget offering multiple features, I wouldn‚Äôt have minded a dedicated pulse button for greater precision.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Struggles with very hard ingredients like nuts.  
- Buttons‚Äô labeling might confuse first-time users.  

**Durability and Daily Maintenance**  
One standout feature is the ease of maintenance. The blender components‚Äîthe lid, jar, and stainless steel blades‚Äîare dishwasher-safe. After making sticky peanut butter (yes, it can handle that if you‚Äôre patient), a quick rinse and dishwasher run had the blender effortlessly cleaned. The blades detach easily, making thorough cleaning a breeze. However, the motor base occasionally traps dust and crumbs in its crevices, and cleaning that requires a bit more effort.

**Competing Products in the Market**  
When compared with products like the Nutribullet or Ninja blenders, this appliance balances price with functionality remarkably well. The Nutribullet excels at compactness and single servings, but it doesn‚Äôt provide the same level of versatility with its settings. The Ninja blenders, on the other hand, are powerhouse devices that can crush nearly anything‚Äîbut at a higher price point and with a bit more noise. The Hamilton Beach 58148A holds its own as a budget-friendly alternative that doesn‚Äôt compromise essential functionalities, even if it's less robust than some high-end rivals.

**Smart Spending Evaluation**  
Considering its price and multifunctionality, this blender is a fantastic option for anyone who doesn‚Äôt need excessive power features. While it‚Äôs not the appliance I‚Äôd recommend for grinding coffee beans or making perfect almond butter daily, it‚Äôs perfect for everyday tasks like cutting morning prep time with smoothies or whipping up weekend margaritas. For most home kitchens, where you're not taking on professional-grade tasks, the Hamilton Beach 58148A offers excellent value for its cost.

A reductionist substance ontology does not allow free will or consciousness for that matter. If you ask me accepting a metaphysics that excludes consciousness and free will is foolish and ultimately self-undermining. The same science when understood through a process relational ontology is perfectly compatible with libertarian free will and consciousness.

So the picture of free will is
The agent is the cause. So that if you say you want coffee and go get coffee there is no explanation for the behavior that excludes the agent, if the agent didn't exist there would be no getting of coffee. If the agent changes their mind and instead decides to have tea this is also perfectly acceptable and they'll get tea not coffee. 

The metaphysics generate the framework that decide whether or not this is acceptably free and whether it is accepted as an act of will of the agent.

The standard classical materialist metaphysics, substance ontology, reductionist, and mechanism view finds it incoherent because those metaphysics pre-exclude any causation that isn't a property of the fundamental substance.

On the other hand a non-classical metaphysics, relational process ontology. Agents are a natural consequence of a dynamic universe. Because an agent is the totality of the relations and process underlying them, they are an actual property of the universe, not illusory.

I don't expect anyone who has already ruled consciousness as illusionist epiphenomena to accept this because they got there by following the metaphysical presumptions and it's unlikely that they are going to go back and challenge those, or even more likely they won't even admit they exist.

Let me set the scene: It was a regular Tuesday. Coffee in hand, emails piling up, bills due, and not a trace of excitement in sight. That is, until I stumbled across a little something called **Bitcoin Jumble** ‚Äî the ultimate Bitcoin raffle draw dApp that turned my dull day into one for the blockchain history books.

I had a few spare sats lying around in my wallet and figured, ‚ÄúWhy not spice things up?‚Äù The website looked slick, straight to the point, and (crucially) decentralized ‚Äî no middlemen, no nonsense. Just pure, peer-to-peer raffle action built on the mighty shoulders of the Bitcoin network. Curious and slightly hopeful, I tossed in a tiny fraction of BTC and grabbed myself a raffle ticket.

Now, I‚Äôve entered raffles before. School ones. Office ones. Even a dodgy one at a street fair where the prize was a suspiciously unlabeled blender. But this? This was different. With **Bitcoin Jumble**, every entry felt like a shot at glory ‚Äî a fair, on-chain shot that anyone could verify. Transparency? Check. Speed? Check. Heart-thumping anticipation? Oh yes.

Fast forward to that glorious moment ‚Äî I‚Äôm refreshing the page, heart racing like a GPU on overclock, and there it is: ‚ÄúüèÜ Winner: YOU.‚Äù

Wait... WHAT?

I won.

**I WON.**

And it wasn‚Äôt just bragging rights or a dusty blender. I won real Bitcoin. Instantly. On-chain. Straight into my wallet, no waiting, no paperwork, and no centralized hoops to jump through. The feeling? Electric. Like mining a full block solo. Like discovering Satoshi‚Äôs real Twitter account. Like digital fireworks exploding in a metaverse sky.

Now I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôve quit my job to live off raffle winnings (yet), but I‚Äôve certainly added **Bitcoin Jumble** to my daily routine. It‚Äôs fun, fast, and honestly kind of addictive ‚Äî in the best way. Whether you‚Äôre a Bitcoin maxi or just looking for a fair shot at a crypto prize pool, this dApp has you covered.

And the best part? It‚Äôs all provably fair. You can check the smart contract. You can follow the randomness. This isn‚Äôt some sketchy exchange spinning a fake wheel behind closed doors. It‚Äôs open, auditable, and powered by the most secure blockchain in the world.

So, if you‚Äôve got some sats to spare and want to feel that adrenaline rush of maybe, just maybe, hitting the Bitcoin jackpot ‚Äî take it from me: go to

Chapter 1  
  
Addison‚Äôs POV  
  
Hot tears ran down my face as I glared at the group in my neighbor‚Äôs backyard. I don‚Äôt think that I have ever been this angry in my life. How could I have been so freaking stupid? I knew better, yet I still fell for it. I watched my longtime crush allow the bane of my existence to act possessively over him. Her hands traced his chest before dropping lower towards his trunks.   
  
He allowed her to do it until his parents came out of the house. They would not appreciate seeing the show. I was sitting on top of my dresser. It was the only way to get a good angle to see the backyard. I am just a glutton for punishment for even attempting to look. I just needed to know.   
  
Garrett used to be my best friend. We grew up together. I thought he was special. I thought he was the one. I thought that once he claimed me, we would be together forever. I was stupid to fall for it. I should have realized that he just wanted to have s\*x with me, just like the other girls. My mind told me he was in on what happened, even as my heart protested that he was also a victim. I am sure that was Tammy‚Äôs goal all along. She was glad to have finally gotten the upper hand on me.   
  
What am I going to do? I need to get out of here, but where can I go? I just turned eighteen yesterday, and my world has completely fallen apart. I could not stop the sobs as my pain increased to double. My life was just beginning and now this. I hated Tammy so much. I don‚Äôt understand why she would do something like this to me, why she hated me so much that she wanted to destroy me like that.   
  
I needed someone here to comfort me, but I was now alone. The scandal exposed today has probably ruined me in this town. I didn‚Äôt know where to turn. My best friend, Kate Bellerby, wanted to be there for me but didn‚Äôt have a car. Plus, our whole community had either heard or seen the video. Her parents told her to stay away from me until it blew over. I doubt that it ever will. The taunts and cruel comments were still ringing in my ears from school this morning. I never thought that you could die from shame, but now I am starting to wish I could.   
  
The two guys who assaulted me this morning were currently standing there and talking to Garrett. They are all having a great time, laughing it up. They were probably all talking about me. I wanted to hear what they said, but they were too far away. I wanted to know if Garrett would defend me to his friends, but it seems that after he got what he wanted from me. He was happy to leave me to deal with the aftermath.   
  
My heart clenched at the thought of what had happened. I have cared for him my whole life. My love for Garrett grew without me realizing it had gone behind a crush. My heart sank with the knowledge that I would never be able to take back what happened between us last night. I couldn‚Äôt stop watching him, no matter how much it hurt.   
  
His stupid, handsome face. He didn‚Äôt care that he ruined my life at all. He managed to avoid the scandal, which was suspicious to me. The humiliation I am suffering hits me again. Why had he not stepped up to defend me? I will never understand how he could do that to me. My eyes are so dry and puffy now they are burning. I can‚Äôt see as well as I could earlier. I had already cried my heart out yesterday, and now this. Logic tells me there is probably a simpler solution to my lack of tears. Maybe I am just numb to all the pain now? More likely, I am probably dehydrated. My anger is taking a backseat to sadness now. How will I ever get past this? I don‚Äôt even know what I am going to do anymore.   
  
I had my life all planned out. I was going to go to college this fall, major in business, and get a secondary degree to do what my mother did. Now, I don‚Äôt know if that will even be possible. All the plans that my mother and I made now lie shattered on the ground.  
  
Loud laughter brought my attention back to the pool party next door. Garrett's father, Russell, was manning the grill. He is speaking to Garrett‚Äôs teammates as they tease each other. Garrett is the quarterback of our high school football team. He has brown hair and piercing blue eyes. He looks exactly like his father, except his father has brown eyes. You can also see precisely what Garrett will look like in twenty years.  
  
With his strong jaw and captivating good looks, it is no surprise that everyone at the high school vies for Garrett's attention. Half the cheer squad is after him, trying to gain and keep his attention. He was going to go pro, just like his father. The cheer squad deferred to Tammy. Her father is the reason that they never get into trouble at school. Well, that is, until yesterday. But this latest attempt to hurt me has gone way too far. I don‚Äôt know how I will recover from it or, honestly, if I ever will.   
  
I heard squealing and looked over to see Alden James standing beside the pool. He is Garrett‚Äôs best friend and favorite running back. Alden smiled and then tossed Summer into the pool. Tripp Reed, one of Garrett‚Äôs tackles, approached the side of the pool with a squirming Whitney in his arms. She was pretending to be scared, but she might be scared now that Summer got thrown into the pool. She is in full makeup, as are her friends. They never go anywhere without being fully put together.   
  
Summer looks like a drowned rat; her makeup is a complete mess. Her mascara might be waterproof, but it seems like nothing else is. Whitney is now acting like a cat about to be bathed, climbing up Tripp's body and trying to hold on to him to keep from being thrown in. The only one in the group safe from being thrown in was Tammy unless Garrett decides to do it, which we all know won‚Äôt happen. She would be furious.  
  
The laughter increases as Tripp jumps into the pool with her in his arms. He couldn‚Äôt wrestle her off of him, as she was holding onto him so tightly. She shrieked when he jumped into the pool with her. She came up for air, still screaming at him. He just laughed at her like it was funny. He knew how much they liked to keep from getting their hair and faces wet. They didn‚Äôt swim. They lounged around or floated in the pool on their floats. They were there to be seen, not swim.   
  
He grabbed the side of the pool and pulled himself out of the water. He was in good shape, even with the extra weight he carried from being a tackle. He was not eighteen yet, but he will be next month. He is a big guy with a broad build, always attracting attention. He was 6‚Äô2‚Äù tall and a junior, but his 235 lb. frame was almost all sheer muscle due to his position in the team. His older brother, Gage, was eighteen and graduating with us this year.  
  
Gage was much quieter than his younger brother. He was a giant at 6‚Äô4‚Äù tall and about 10 lbs. heavier than his younger brother. He was there with his girlfriend of the last four years, Samantha Harris. She was nice. I have interacted with her a lot over the years. She didn‚Äôt turn her back on me when Garrett iced me out of his group three years ago. She didn't fear being thrown in the pool. She also didn't fear Tammy picking on her as she sat in the lounger beside Gage. He would never allow her to get picked on. Everyone knew that they were going to get married one day. She had what these other girls wanted: a real relationship with a man who would probably be going on to play professionally.   
  
You would think the girls on the cheer squad would realize a few truths from that. Sam, as she was called, was there with a bare face, yet she was still beautiful. She was also bigger than the other girls there, just like I had been. It was probably how we hit it off so well. She was perhaps size twelve, as she looked to be about a size down from me.   
  
She had a very curvy body and was clearly comfortable in her own skin. It wasn‚Äôt just because she knew that Gage had her back. She was very confident. She had chosen a bikini, too, to emphasize her slim waist. It was her breasts and hips that made her the slightly larger size she was, and Gage made no secret that he liked how she looked. Gage was possessive of Sam; everyone here knew she was off limits.   
  
After Tripp got out of the pool, he glanced at his brother and Sam. It was like a lightbulb suddenly came on. He immediately turned back around and looked right up at my window. It was scary that he seemed to know exactly which room was mine. I doubt he felt me watching them. How could he possibly know that I was watching the group of them? I think seeing Sam reminded him of what happened at school this morning.   
  
My blinds were open, but I was sure he couldn‚Äôt see me. His slow smile was incredibly creepy to me. I froze in place, refusing to move or close my blinds. Doing either of them would alert him that I was indeed watching them. It seemed like it didn‚Äôt matter to him anyway. He seemed to be able to sense that I was there. He started posing for me, which drew everyone‚Äôs attention to him. They are all incredibly confident in their appearance. Their hard work shows, and they don‚Äôt mind showing it off.  
  
Now, they are all looking up at the window to my room. I couldn‚Äôt move. I couldn‚Äôt even breathe. I honestly don‚Äôt think they could see me. There was no way. The slats on my shutter blinds were tilted at a specific angle, mostly closed. It was to prevent them from being able to see into my room. Yet, it allows me to watch them unnoticed. Well, until now. Tripp was positive that I was watching them. He even turned away from me to pose again, like he was some sort of bodybuilder.   
  
Both he and Alden are now posing for me. They are trying to one-up the other. Tripp‚Äôs mocking voice called, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, Addison. The cold water might make it look smaller, but I want to show you how much bigger and better I am than your mystery guy. I can come over now if you want a go with me.""  
  
He then grabbed his c\*\*k in his hand and thrust himself towards me. The group‚Äôs laughter was loud. What hurt the most was that even Garrett was laughing along with them like he was; the mystery guy. His parents rushed out of the house to see what was happening with all the yelling. They looked around in confusion about why Tripp was yelling and everyone else was laughing at his antics. It wasn't funny at all. My heart sinks with the knowledge that Garrett had lied to me last night, from beginning to end.   
  


# Uninvited Again

Chapter 2  
  
Addison‚Äôs POV  
  
Three Days Earlier  
  
I sat on my dresser to watch everyone at the pool party next door. It was Sunday, and I had not been invited to the party as usual. It was already hot here in Frisco, Texas, as it was the middle of May. I wasn‚Äôt too upset about not being invited. As far as I could see, it was the usual jerks invited. Half the football team, and several members of the cheer squad were all there. All of them vying for the football players' attention. They had been out there since two p.m. and showed no signs of the party being over any time soon.  
  
I had been studying at my desk when the noise started outside. My finals are tomorrow, and I wanted to end the school year right. I have spent most of my time doing what was needed for college. Volunteering was a big part of that, as well as having a high GPA, to get into The University of Texas in Dallas. I spent my morning helping out at the local senior citizen's home. I enjoyed interacting with them, and Mom always came with me. I had everything I needed to get in and had already been accepted. I didn‚Äôt need to volunteer anymore, but I kept on. I enjoyed spending time with them, as we had made several friends there. I've learned a lot from them.  
  
I have lived here, next door to the Pearson family, my whole life. I had been friends with Garrett since we could crawl. He was three months older than me, so he had turned eighteen a few months back in February. He was standing with his friends and laughing about something as they waited for Mr. Pearson to finish with the burgers and hot dogs. Tammy came out of the house in the tiniest bikini that I have ever seen in my life. The way Garret‚Äôs eyes followed her around made me want to throw up.  
  
I am turning eighteen tomorrow and would be lying if I said I wasn‚Äôt looking forward to it. I was ready to go to college and leave this town far behind. When I leave, I will only miss my mother, my two friends, and the people at the nursing home. We have already promised to keep in touch after I leave. I climbed down off my dresser and headed to grab a shower. I wanted to study after dinner to make sure I was ready for the finals.  
  
I was already locked in as the Valedictorian. It didn‚Äôt matter if Allison Henry got full marks for everything. She was too far behind to be able to take it from me. I know it pissed her off, but it was nothing personal. I had goals that I wanted to achieve and to do that, I needed to earn as many scholarships as possible. I didn't want my mother to have to stress about it. All she asked of me was to do my best. So, that is what I did. I always tried to make her proud of me.   
  
I was not as excited about my birthday as I could have been. I was completely prepared for the tests. That was not the issue; my birthday came with both joy and sadness. I was going to finally be eighteen, and an adult. But I was also going to have the reminder that Mom and I were all alone in the world. My father passed away from cancer when I was about to turn three years old. My mother still wears her wedding ring to this day. The love she still has for him is strong.  
  
She still loves and misses him. I have always hoped to have the same kind of love that they shared. I thought I had found it in my best friend, but I was wrong. I have always played with the children of our next-door neighbors. The Pearsons were good friends to my parents. They helped Mom through the mourning process after losing my father.   
  
I have had a crush on Garrett since I was thirteen. Before that, he was my best friend. We did everything together. I was a bit of a tomboy. I climbed trees, learned to shoot guns at the range with him and his father, and had paintball wars with him and his younger brother until I turned fifteen at the end of my freshman year of high school.  
  
Up until I was suddenly shown that I wasn‚Äôt good enough to be around Garrett anymore. Things had become tense between us. Garrett turned his back on me and let his friends start bullying me. I can remember when it happened very clearly. It was the last month of our freshman year when Tammy Daniels showed up. Her father was the new assistant principal, as the old vice-principal had a health emergency and retired. They had moved here from Tennessee. She took one look at my best friend, and that was all it took.   
  
I felt sick about being replaced. She was everything that I wasn‚Äôt: slim and gorgeous. She had long blonde hair and big blue eyes. She looked lovely and sweet, but she was anything but. She always managed to look perfect. Her makeup was always flawless, and I felt like the hunchback of Notre Dame next to her. It was evident from the start that he wanted her, and it didn‚Äôt take long for that to happen. We found out the hard way. Mom watched their house for them as they went to a family reunion in Galveston.   
  
Garrett had football camp and was supposed to spend the weekend with his best friend, Alden. I saw the light in his room come on. His room is directly across from mine. I saw the light come on in his room. I was shocked to see him and Tammy sleeping together that night. After they were done, they both left. It broke my heart to see him with her. I saw Tammy at school the next day, and her smile let me know that she knew I had seen them together. I just rolled my eyes at her and headed for class.   
  
It was a well-known fact that most of the cheer squad wanted to get with the guys who were slated to go pro. That was always their goal, but to me, that was no goal at all. Why didn‚Äôt they set their own goals? Why didn‚Äôt they have dreams to accomplish for themselves? Why did they all want to be dependent on someone else to make them happy? Things were hard for us when I was younger. They got easier, but I didn't want to depend on a man. I wanted to make my own way.  
  
As I showered, I wondered again what made Garrett turn his back on me. He wasn‚Äôt just my best friend. I had always fantasized about him taking me to prom. I wanted him to tell everyone he loved me and I belonged to him. The dream seemed so real that it hurt to wake up and realize it hadn't been real.   
  
I dried off, wrapping my long auburn hair up in a towel. I gave myself a hard look in the mirror. I liked my full lips despite them getting unwanted attention. I didn‚Äôt mind the scattering of freckles on my cheeks and a few on my nose. I could always cover them with makeup. I was attractive, but I wouldn‚Äôt say that I was beautiful. My emerald green eyes looked dull and sad, and I knew why. Each time I see Garrett with Tammy, it hurts my heart. I knew it was time for dinner as I could smell the delicious food as I headed downstairs. I was surprised that she had made my favorite dinner of enchiladas as I came to the table.   
  
‚ÄúI wanted to surprise you, Addison. You would have been expecting them tomorrow, so I made them today,‚Äù my mother said with a mischievous smile.  
  
‚ÄúThanks, Mom,‚Äù I replied as I sank into the chair beside her. This helped. My mother always seemed to know when I was having a hard time. I have an issue with comfort eating, which is its own vicious cycle.   
  
My mother prayed over our meal, and we dug in. My mother has been and always will be my biggest supporter. No matter what, she has always been there for me. It has been me and her against the world for the last fifteen years. Yesterday was the fifteenth anniversary of my father's passing. He died two days before my third birthday, and I knew that it made it even harder for her to celebrate my birthday each year.   
  
My mother asked questions about my plans for the future. My mother was involved in my life. She only had one friend, our next-door neighbor, Tandy Pearson. This was part of the reason that Garrett and I were such good friends. We have been together since we were babies. Mom and Mrs. Tandy would get together to shop, meet for coffee, and just hang out in our backyard.   
  
My mother had turned our backyard into an oasis. It had lush greenery and an abundance of colorful flowers. My mother had a large gazebo built towards the back of our property. There was a bridge you walked over to get to it, with a large Koi pond that ran about thirty feet long. It was three feet deep in most of the area, as my mother loved those fish. They provided her with comfort when she wanted to relax. Mom worked at home. She never had to leave the house, as far as I knew. She always seemed to have money these days. Things were more challenging when I was younger, but starting at about age ten, things became much easier for us. She said the extra income was from my father‚Äôs life insurance.  
  
I always believed that as a child. We lived in a nice home in an upper-middle-class neighborhood. We live comfortable lives. I don‚Äôt know how she does it. We aren‚Äôt wealthy, but we aren‚Äôt scraping by either.   
  
‚ÄúAddison, after you graduate, I want to talk to you about us moving back to Dallas,‚Äù my mother said hesitantly.   
  
‚ÄúBack to Dallas? I've never lived there, so how could it be back to Dallas, Mom?‚Äù I replied. My analytical mind immediately corrected what she had just said.   
  
‚ÄúBut I did,‚Äù my mother softly replied.   
  
I am interested now, as she never talked about her past. She usually kept things about me when we spoke and always avoided talking about anything before meeting my father. I have to admit I was getting a little nervous at how she looked at me.   
  
‚ÄúYou can tell me now, Mom,‚Äù I responded. I wanted to know what she was going to say. I was curious, and I just wanted to know what was going on.   
  
‚ÄúIt can wait, honey. No rush. It is not like you are starting college tomorrow. You have your finals tomorrow, and I want you focused on those. I can‚Äôt tell you how proud I am of you, Addison. Your father would have been just as proud of you, too. You are my pride and joy, and I hope you never forget that. Let‚Äôs just get past your finals and celebrate your birthday, and we will discuss it after that, OK?‚Äù my mother asked. I nodded in agreement. It was her call, as she was the one who wanted to talk in the first place.   
  
We spoke a little longer before I returned to my room to study. I noticed movement as I walked up to my desk in front of my window. I looked over into Garrett‚Äôs room, and I really wished I hadn‚Äôt.  
  


# A Nasty Surprise

Chapter 3  
  
Addison‚Äôs POV  
  
Was he seriously screwing Tammy with a house full of guests?  
  
She was bent over, holding his desk to support her, and he was pounding into her. I don‚Äôt know how she noticed me. Knowing her, she was probably waiting for me to show up. She knew finals were tomorrow, yet she was inside his room instead of studying. She immediately turned to look at me. Her smile said it all. She was glad I had caught them together. It was clear that she probably set this show up for me to see. He didn‚Äôt stop or even notice that I was standing there. He had just slid his swim trunks down, and her bikini bottom had also been pulled down. His hands were on her hips, and he was focused on what he was trying to do.   
  
I knew I probably had a deer in the headlights look on my face, but now that she had an audience, she bent down lower and pushed herself back towards Garrett. She was obviously egging him on. I can see him get even more aggressive with his thrusts. I don‚Äôt know what she said to him, but whatever it was, he was encouraged to go even faster than I thought possible. Tammy grabbed one of her breasts and cried out as he continued to thrust into her. She wanted me to enjoy the show, and that knowledge broke me out of shock.   
  
She wanted to embarrass me, but she was the one who should be embarrassed. I quickly closed my blinds, but I guess Garrett noticed the movement himself, as he seemed to stop mid-stroke and gape at me as I approached my window. I snapped my blinds closed and headed to my bed. I bit my lower lip as I tried to calm myself down. There was a vast difference in knowing they were sleeping together, but seeing them in action together was jarring. I had caught them before, but my brain could make excuses for him unless they shoved it in my face. I know Garrett was stunned to see me at my window, but I doubt it stopped them. They are probably back at it again. I am not going to look. I honestly don't want to know.   
  
I always knew Tammy was a snake. From the first moment I met her, she had shown me who she was. She was always speaking her ugly comments in my ear to keep others from hearing her and seeing who she was. She was the vice principal's daughter, and he doted on her. He had to, as she was his daughter, but I saw nothing good in her. She cheated on Garrett every chance she got. Even going to frat parties without him, and ending up in bad situations. There was a lot of proof, as pictures would get leaked, and she would be hooking up with some guy in the background. This last time around, she was hooking up with two guys.  
  
The worst part? Garrett always forgave her. I guess she had a gold-plated v\*\*\*\*a or something, as cheating was always a deal-breaker for me. I wanted the man I loved to love back just as much. I wanted him to want to take care of me, just like I was going to take care of him. I wanted our love to be just like the wedding vows stated, ‚ÄòForsaking all others.‚Äô That is what I wanted, what I have always wanted. To feel adored, to be cared for, to be protected. For me to be above everyone else as far as my husband was concerned. Or is asking my husband to show me how much he loves me too much to expect? That is all that I've ever wanted. I am beginning to suspect that it may not be easy to find anymore.  
  
I got up early. I could not focus last night, so I will study this morning before the tests. That way, it will be fresh in my mind. I grabbed my book bag and headed downstairs. I had my usual outfit on‚Äîa pair of jeans and an oversized hoodie. I started wearing them, even in the hotter months after Tammy arrived. I got sick of her calling me out about my ""horrid"" auburn hair color. Both my mother and I have the same auburn color. Tammy started calling me the McDonald's mascot name, and that nickname followed me around for years. I hated it, so, of course, it stuck.  
  
I loved our shared hair color, but being the only person in school with this auburn color made me stand out. That was not a positive for me, at all. I had even thought about coloring it just to get Tammy and her friends to stop. Thankfully, my mother talked me out of it. I covered it up, only taking the hood off during class and eating lunch. Amazingly, for the most part, it is out of sight, out of mind, and that worked out well for me.   
  
‚ÄúHappy birthday, Addison! I made your favorite breakfast. I will be driving you to school today. I need to pick up a few things for your birthday. Do you want me to pick up a cake? Or would you rather I bake you one?‚Äù she asked.   
  
‚ÄúIf you have the time, I would rather have your famous strawberry cake,‚Äù I replied with a smile. I dove into my scrambled eggs before grabbing a few slices of bacon and a piece of toast. I knew that I needed the protein to get through the day. Mom was always a big help in understanding that on test days, I needed complete focus; I didn‚Äôt need to crash.   
  
We headed out to the garage, and I set the alarm as Mom opened the garage door and the car. We were a great team. I buckled up and grinned. My birthday had started out great. Well, at least I thought it did until we backed out of the garage. I saw Garrett walking to his truck. Before I could turn away, he glanced over. He flushed when he saw me. I guess he was embarrassed at my having seen the show last night. I just turned my face away from him until we got to the street. Mom drove smoothly down the street, asking a few more questions on the short trip to school.   
  
She lets me drive her car to school on days she doesn‚Äôt want to drive. The school is only a few miles from our home, and I am a good driver. When my mom pulled up at school, I went to run off. She grabbed my hand and stopped me before saying, ‚ÄúAddison, I have a present for you before you go. I got this on my eighteenth birthday. I want to hand it down to you now. I will explain it more this weekend. But take care of it. It is precious to me.‚Äù  
  
I was surprised to see a box containing a beautiful sapphire ring in my hand. It had two small diamonds on either side of the stone. It was lovely and unexpected, and I already loved it. ‚ÄúThanks, Mom. I will always take care of it.‚Äù It slid right onto my ring finger on my right hand, and it was a great birthday present.   
  
‚ÄúThat isn‚Äôt the only thing you have coming to you today. This is a big birthday. I will pick it up and then grab what I need to make your cake. See you at three, Addison,‚Äù my mother told me. I leaned over to hug her, and she kissed my temple.   
  
""Love you, Mom,"" I told her as I ended the hug.  
  
‚ÄúJust remember this, my sweet girl, nothing these kids say to you matters, not in the long run. Right now, it is hard. High school is tough; just know that five or ten years from now, none of this matters anymore. You did your best, and you made us proud. Your success makes others jealous. You were born to succeed, my angel. I want you to spread your wings and fly so high that no one can touch you. Life can be hard; just know that it will get easier. You have less than one more week of school, and we are out of here. I believe that you can play hooky a day or two before graduation. You won‚Äôt lose your spot. Well, at least that is what Principal Carson told me,‚Äù she said with a wink.   
  
""Don‚Äôt worry about me, Mom. I've got this,‚Äù I replied with a smile. I heard loud music playing before I saw Garrett parking his truck a row away from us. I need to get going now. I didn‚Äôt want to run into him.   
  
‚ÄúBye, Mom. Love you,‚Äù I chirped as I got out of the car.  
  
‚ÄúBye, Addie. I will see you after school,‚Äù Mom told me, waving goodbye as I shut the door. I quickly headed towards school. I could see Tammy and her merry band of followers heading for the same door I was. I changed directions rapidly. They hadn‚Äôt seen me yet. Thankfully, their discussion on exactly which color was the perfect lip color was very engrossing.   
  
I didn‚Äôt hesitate as I picked another door to enter. It was closer to my classroom anyway. They would hang out and talk, and I didn't have time for their drama. I needed to study. I don‚Äôt have time to waste on them. If it was one thing my parents instilled in me, it was a strict mindset. My father mentioned it each year in the birthday videos he made for me. Mom always lets me watch them after school if my birthday isn't on a weekend. It was very emotional to see him, and I would not have been able to focus on my finals if I had watched it this morning.   
  
So, each year, after I got home, we would go to the dining room table, and Mom would light my candles. She would sing me happy birthday, and I would make a wish. Then we would have a piece of cake and then watch my father‚Äôs video. Mom transferred them to discs and downloaded them. That way, I would always have them. I knew that my education was important to them both. I wanted to make my mother proud of me. Remembering what she said made me smile again.   
  
I was so focused on studying that I didn‚Äôt hear anyone approach. The next thing I knew, my book was tossed onto the floor, and my hood was yanked back off my head.   
  
‚ÄúDid you enjoy the show, p\*\*\*\*\*t?‚Äù Tammy asked me.   
  
‚ÄúDo you enjoy putting on a show? You would have shut the blinds if you didn‚Äôt want to be seen. Well, that assumes that you are smart enough to operate the blinds. I am, so that is exactly what I did, so I didn‚Äôt have such a disgusting view,‚Äù I replied calmly. I wasn‚Äôt the one in the wrong here.   
  
‚Äúb\*\*\*h, what did you just say?‚Äù Tammy asked in stunned surprise.   
  
‚ÄúHere, let me speak slower so you and your minions can understand. Garrett has the same blinds that I have. They can be opened or closed. When you go to have s\*x, I would suggest closing them. I can assure you that no one wants to see it,‚Äù I replied with a grimace. I know I hadn‚Äôt wanted to.   
  
""You b\*\*\*h!‚Äù Tammy said and reared back to slap me.   
  
Her hand froze in midair when someone yelled, ‚ÄúStop right there, Tammy. What do you think you‚Äôre doing?",1,1746891161.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False
1kjczcg,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1kjczcg/help/,Help,"M37&F42 single mom of one. We have been working together for 2yrs and in the span of two years it's been a long journey. What started as friends turned into a situation. From the begining I have always been attracted to her. One day I grew some balls and I told her how I felt which she initially brushed me off. As time went by. We became closer and closer. We stared leaving work together and since I don't drive. She would give me a lift home. What started as a lift home turned into long drives listening to music. One night on one of our long drives. We went to the park walked around and it was flirty and playful. From that day, we started getting closer and closer to the point other colleagues mentioned it. At this point, I thought. Why not ask her out on a date. Being that when we were together. We would talk about how funny it would be for us to go ice skating as I never been  and she has. We talked about going for walks, bike riding etc. Now every time I ask her hey let's go on such and such a day she would say yes then a couple of days leading to date day. She says such and such happened we can't go. Now sometimes I know things happen but It was just weird that something always happens. To me it was a bit flaky croissant vibes but at the same time. We talk regularly on the phone for hours. Sometimes even 8 hrs so I was confused as to how we can have so much chemistry and yet she's being flaky. This did not happen once but numerous times. Dropping me home wasn't an issue but when time came to hang out not just when we leave work. She would give an excuse. Her famous phrase is I dont have time for her. I make so much time for her it's crazy sometimes I even lose sleep just to talk to her on the phone. To make things worse sometimes she would get upset at me for no apparent reason at all. I would let a day or two go by and I  would call her talk to  talk to her and calm her down then we're back in good terms. This has happened numerous times. Now my birthday recently came up and before I left for my holiday to the states which is a whole different time zone we had a little moment at work and she said she will miss me. She told me I should make time and call her. I promised her I would which I did. Now while on holiday, we talked about when I come back we should meet up. Which she said yes to. I wasn't gone for long but my holiday was for 10 days. Now two days before my return. I woke up as normal while on holiday messaged her as normal. Which she responded. Some lovey dovey texts back and forth. From nowhere, she drops a bomb on me via text saying She didn't want to talk to me anymore because I don't make time for her. That shit threw me off. If anything I was livid. So I told her something in the lines of. I couldn't understand why she felt that way when I am clearly creating time while on holiday in a different time zone. I then messaged her that if that's how she felt so be it. Her response was ""Perfect"". That right there fucked me all the way up. Since I was flying back in two days. I messaged her I will call her when I land but got no response. When I landed I called her like I said I would no answer. At this point I thought not to bother her since I will see her at work. Now between that moment and the time I had work two days went by. Within those two days as one can imagine I was distraught.  I asked Chatgbt what to do and it suggested to go no contact. So I put on a brave face and went no contact. When we finally went back to work. It's like I did something so bad and she wouldn't even talk to me unless it's work related. Which fucked me up again. So at this point am fucked up all over. So I decided ok. Match her energy. I went ghost and only talk to her about work which is a convo that lasts max 2min. The truth of the matter is though. I miss her deeply and I thought what we had was deep and real but a big butt. I can't help but feel like am being manipulated. I can't help but feel played. I can't help but feel disrespected when I have been nothing but genuine and caring. Am talking she would go to her office and find coffee and pastries before she starts work kinda ting. Which she would respond with an affectionate gesture. Where did all that shit go? I would hate to think she's a narcissist but am starting to feel like she's one. I need help. Help understand what could possibly be happening here as I fail to believe she could be that cruel to me for nothing and for so long to string me along. I don't cheat or flirt with other women. Is this what they mean when they say good guys finish last? Am not perfect and I have a a crazy past in the streets so I have been through it all homelessness, jail, fights disowned by family members but AV done the work and am proud of it. Am not that guy no more. I make a conscious decision to be a honest and genuine person no matter what I do but this shit right here? This shit right here my ü•∑üèæü•∑üèæ (Katt Williams voice. If you know you know) cut me different. A part of me wants to revert to my old me because the old me was strong and didn't give a fuck about nada but at the same time it took so much work to be the person I am today. No therapy involved just good ol' self reflection and making better decisions. Can anyone offer any advice or share  if they went through something similar and how they dealt with it because am in love with her and I think she knows it leave alone feel it. I miss her and I want her back. Everyday without her feels like my balls and ass are itching at the same time and am agitated and can't even seat still. I need help y'all. Did she even care about me in the first place? Does she miss me? Is this a front she's putting up to protect her ego but deep down she's growing through the same thing?  

I forgot to add. Today I decided to talk to her and asked her if she's ok and if everything is good. Her response I was everything is perfect. How? How can it be perfect when you ghost me for taking a holiday for my bday which I still stayed in communication with her. For those reading this and you ghost and play games. That shit is evil and childish so please stop because a part of wants revenge. A part of me wants to see her go what am going through to understand the gravity of the situation.

I'm looking for someone to play coop games with (we were here, it takes two, split fiction, ...) or any other kind of multiplayer games. I find that it's a great way to break the ice and get to know each other slowly while playing together. For now I'm mostly looking for friendship but I'm not opposed for it to develop into something more if the feelings are there. It would be best if you live in Europe in order to avoid struggling with time zones. I'm open to meet and have a drink/meal together if we live close to each other. I'm also looking to travel to another country so if you live in an interesting place to visit that might be a good occasion to meet in the future.

Here's some info about me :

I'm 29, I live in France near Paris. I work as a software developer. Appearance side, I have brown eyes and hair.

I like videos games, mostly RPG and indie games but also coop games and multiplayer ones (what a surprise, right ?). I like reading and tabletop RPG.

I like running  (I'm participating to some running events throughout the year to motivate myself to continue) and a bit of bouldering.

I tend to be more of a homebody as I like to stay at home chilling especially during winter where I can be comfy watching TV with a plaid and some coffee. But I also like from time to time to move outside to see a friend or all other kind of occasion.

I really like animals, even though I don't have any at the moment so feel free to send me a pic of your pet if you have any.

I have an electric Cuisinart burr grinder.  But the amount of coffee it grinds is pretty finicky. I have no control over the weight. Just to grind  2,4,5 or 8 cups worth of coffee,   Etc.  and it tends to grind up a lot of coffee at once (more than 25 grams)

The grind quality itself seems OK, and I can adjust it from coarse to fine. 

I guess the question is should I stick with this grinder and just toss what is left when it grinds too much? Or should I invest in an affordable manual burger grinder?. If so, do you have any recommendations for an affordable manual burr grinder in the $50 range? ",2,1746890617.0,pourover,7,1.0,False

1kjcs3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1kjcs3s/2_mo_old_gas_or_reflux/,"2 mo old, gas or reflux?","My 2 month old is eating 4 to 6 oz every 2-3 hours, both formula (Enfamil gentlease) and breastmilk (off dairy, eggs,coffee, chocolate, and broccoli), directly from breast and expressed.  He always eats sitting in a ~45 degree angle and he is held upright for ~15 minutes after each feed. He also takes gas drops with every feed and probiotics once a day.

When eating he sometimes makes these jerky movements and pulls away from the breast or bottle, then cries. When stopping mid way through the feeding to burp, he starts crying (before and after producing a burp). 
During other feedings, he eats just fine but still gets fussy during the burping. He rarely spits up during burps or feedings.

Sometimes he‚Äôd wake up from naps crying really bad. After holding him in the colic position (only position that works in those cases), he calms down and off-gasses a bit. Other times, he off-gasses with no pain whatsoever, even smiling while lying on his back.

What‚Äôs throwing the pediatrician off is that he sleeps at night. A stretch of 6 to 8 hours, no problems, no fussiness. I‚Äôm posting this here in the hopes that someone with a similar experience can enlighten us.

-Decent weatherproofing & traction for PNW streets & trails with medium rain.

-Can camp & do light hiking/single night backpacking in them in inclement weather) - no space/want for specialized hiking boots. I have running shoes for sunny day hikes - rarer in western WA

-Look good enough to wear out/to work to the office (they don‚Äôt care what I wear, but I don‚Äôt want to be wearing tech hiking boots on dates/to work

1kjcpxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kjcpxa/might_the_jura_x10_espresso_machine_be_the_best/,Might the Jura X10 Espresso Machine Be the Best Workplace Coffee Solution Review?,"Testing the Jura 15669 X10 Espresso Machine gave me one of the most enjoyable coffee experiences to date. This high-end appliance stands out due to its sleek modern design, robust functionality, and ability to cater to the coffee preferences of a diverse crowd. Ideal for settings like offices, small catering venues, or even for personal use if you‚Äôre serious about your coffee, the Jura X10 doesn‚Äôt just prepare coffee; it crafts an experience. Featuring 35 coffee specialties and the ability to handle up to 100 drinks daily, this machine is an impressive addition to any coffee setup.

**Build Quality and Aesthetic Appeal**

The Dark Inox finish instantly caught my eye. It complements modern interiors, looking more like a centerpiece than a machine destined for the corner of a counter. Its dimensions‚Äî14.7"" D x 18"" W x 18.5"" H‚Äîmay not make it the most compact option out there, but it fits well in most kitchens or office break rooms. The dark metallic finish gives off a premium vibe, and despite its bulk, it doesn‚Äôt feel intrusive. With a weight of 31 pounds, it‚Äôs not moving anywhere quickly, but that heft adds to the durable, high-quality feel.

**Ease of Use**

Operating it is a breeze thanks to the touch-sensitive 3.5‚Äù color display. The buttons are intuitive, making it quick to whip up your favorite espresso or frothy latte even without prior experience. My colleague (who isn‚Äôt particularly tech-savvy) managed to figure it out with minimal help. I appreciated that the machine combines modern technology with a few hard-touch buttons‚Äîbeyond the aesthetics, it adds to its durability, as touchscreens can sometimes be a bit fragile in high-use environments.

**Highlights**

- Cold Brew Technology introduces a unique feature with cold-extracted coffees.
- Built-in P.A.G.2+ grinder ensures beans are ground to the perfect consistency.
- Large water tank and bean holder, reducing the frequency of refills.
- One-touch buttons for classics like Americano, cappuccino, and more.
- Suitable for personal or small-scale professional use.

[Check Jura 15669 X10 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0dlpx3clk/)

**Customization and Performance**

Flexibility is where this coffee maker shines. By tweaking strength, milk-to-coffee ratio, and even foam settings, it caters to different tastes. My family members joked that our kitchen now feels like a personalized coffee shop, with each of us having our custom settings. The cold extraction process was a game-changer‚Äîit brewed a cold coffee that was smooth, rich, and far from the watered-down versions you typically get when using ice.

The machine‚Äôs pulse extraction process (P.E.P.) delivers professional-grade espresso in both taste and appearance. Consistency is key in coffee making, and I found the Jura X10 excelled in this regard. Whether it‚Äôs the first pull or the tenth, the quality is unwavering. That said, if you‚Äôre looking for your ‚Äúmorning coffee on the go,‚Äù this machine‚Äôs brewing consistency might spoil you for anything less.

**Pluses**

- Flexibility with coffee customization for personalized tastes.
- Stylish design blending into modern kitchen environments or offices.
- High-capacity reservoir for water and large coffee bean container.
- Exceptional cold-brew functionality.
- Fully automatic and user-friendly interface.

**Areas of Concern**

While incredibly functional, there are aspects that could see improvement:

- The size might be prohibitive for smaller kitchens or spaces.
- Cleaning it thoroughly takes a bit of effort, removing accessible parts carefully for maintenance.
- Price point makes it an investment‚Äînot for casual coffee drinkers.
- Noise from the grinder, though not unusual, might bother users sensitive to sound.

**Competitive Options**

In the realm of coffee machines, direct competitors like the Breville Oracle Touch and the De‚ÄôLonghi Dinamica Plus come to mind. The Breville delivers a closer barista-like experience, but it lacks the impressive cold-brew feature of this model. On the other hand, the Dinamica Plus is more space-efficient, making it ideal for tighter setups, though it doesn‚Äôt provide the same level of beverage variety.

What sets this espresso maker apart is its inclusion of advanced extraction technology combined with intuitive usability. While others may outperform it in price or compactness, few match its ability to deliver consistent, high-quality coffee beverages across multiple varieties.

**Smart Spending**

Considering its features, robust build quality, and versatility, the Jura X10 strikes a decent balance between luxury and value. Cheaper machines abound, but they often compromise on either durability, customization options, or taste. This is not the case here, as each drink feels worthy of the price paid for the machine.

If you‚Äôre building a coffee station for a small office or creating a professional-grade setup at home, this product justifies its position in the higher price range. On the flip side, casual coffee drinkers may find similar satisfaction from less-expensive alternatives.

My husband Nathan Carter hasn't touched me once in five years of marriage.  
  
If my skin accidentally brushed against his, I'd be punished by soaking in disinfectant for a full day.  
  
The resulting rashes and sores made me cautious, always careful to keep my distance.  
  
Until one day, I saw it‚Äîa lipstick stain on his collarbone.  
  
And when I reached out‚Ä¶ he didn't punish me this time.  
  
I thought maybe he was finally overcoming his aversion to me.  
  
But the next day, I found myself listed as an item at an exclusive auction attended by the city's wealthiest elites.  
  
The item up for bid? My VIRGINITY.  
  
\---  
  
I clutched my coat, the paper bag in my hand holding ointment for my inflamed skin.  
  
From the room at the far end, laughter echoed‚Äîeach burst louder than the last.  
  
Their voices hit me like a thunderclap.  
  
""She actually dared to touch where Zoey kissed him. Who does she think she is? Just looking at her makes me sick.""  
  
""You have waited forever for that kiss, and Stella had the nerve to put her hands on him? She needs to be taught a lesson.""  
  
Then I heard Nathan sneered: ""A lesson? Please. That old virgin would beg for some rich bastard to auction off her purity!"" His voice dripped with venom. ""You have no idea how desperate she is‚Äîlike she'll die without a man inside her!""  
  
With that, the laughter grew even louder.  
  
""Zoey is allergic to the smell on Stella's body, and she will feel nauseous when she smells it. That's why you disinfects after every contact."" someone sneered. ""And poor Stella actually thinks she's unclean!""  
  
""This auction's doing her a favor!"" Another voice jeered. ""Finally gets to lose that pesky virginity. Bet she's thrilled!""  
  
The roof nearly shook from their mocking laughter.  
  
I bit my lip hard, my fists clenched so tight my nails dug into my palms.  
  
It took everything I had to stay standing.  
  
For years, I'd believed myself contaminated‚Äîevery night, I'd soak in disinfectant baths.  
  
Over time, my skin had deteriorated‚Äîinflamed, red, covered in sores that never fully healed.  
  
Nathan had the marital bed replaced with two singles, terrified of catching whatever I supposedly had.  
  
When I'd demanded answers, he'd simply claimed he was a germaphobe.  
  
All this time...  
  
All this suffering...  
  
So... Just because of Zoey Miller! Because my very existence disgusted her!  
  
What a joke!  
  
The realization hit like a knife to the gut.  
  
Hot tears of humiliation streaked down my face as those vile words echoed in my skull, shredding what little dignity I had left.  
  
I married Nathan through an arranged marriage, but we'd known each other since childhood.  
  
I'd made excuses‚Äîhis ""germaphobia"" was a medical condition.  
  
So I was patient. I accommodated every quirk.  
  
Five years of swallowing my pride, of begging for scraps of affection... only to be trampled into the dirt...  
  
The pain was so overwhelming that it made me sober.  
  
With numb fingers, I dialed Nathan's grandma.  
  
""Grandma. Nathan has betrayed me. The auction in the city center two days later will prove that.""  
  
""Let me go.""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
I got home very late to find Nathan waiting on the couch.  
  
When our eyes met, something was different.  
  
Gone was his usual coldness‚Äîinstead, there was an unmistakable hunger in his gaze.  
  
Then I saw it:  
  
A lipstick-stained coffee cup.  
  
A scrap of lace lingerie peeking from the cushions.  
  
My breath caught, my heart feeling like it was being torn apart.  
  
""Haven't you always wanted to touch me? Five years, and I don't believe you've never wanted to.""  
  
I stared in shock at the desire darkening his gaze.  
  
What game was he playing now?  
  
Didn't I disgust him?  
  
Wasn't he supposed to be a germaphobe?  
  
Remembering the conversation I'd overheard, my face hardened.  
  
""I'm tired. I need to rest.""  
  
As I tried to leave, he yanked my arm roughly.  
  
He shoved me against the wall and, like a man possessed, ripped my clothes to shreds.  
  
I stood naked in the cold air, shivering from head to toe.  
  
The next second, he pushed me into the master bedroom and locked the door from outside.  
  
His cold voice drifted through: ""I have work to do. Stay put until morning.""  
  
I realized then‚ÄîI pounded on the door frantically, but it was useless.  
  
Standing naked, I felt completely vulnerable.  
  
I searched the entire bedroom but couldn't find a single piece of clothing.  
  
Even the sheets and curtains had been removed.  
  
Suddenly, a bright light pierced through the transparent windows, dancing across my beasts.  
  
I focused my eyes and saw several men in the villa opposite fighting over binoculars, practically climbing over each other to get a look.  
  
""That's her‚ÄîStella! The virgin they're auctioning off! Props to Nathan for letting us preview the merchandise before we drop serious cash at the auction. This is fucking epic!""  
  
""Let me see, let me see! Holy shit, she's smoking hot! Don't know if we can outbid those rich old bastards.""  
  
""Who cares about winning? We're getting a free peep show right now! That's a win in my book, hahaha!""  
  
I stood frozen in place.  
  
Their lecherous stares were like needles piercing my skin, causing excruciating pain with nowhere to hide.  
  
I hugged myself tightly, trembling in the corner.  
  
Then Nathan's voice came from downstairs.  
  
""Stella actually thought I wanted her. You should've seen the look in her eyes‚Äîlike she wanted to devour me right there. Disgusting!""  
  
There was also the sound of disinfectant spraying between the words.  
  
""Don't worry, Zoey, baby. You're the only one who gets to touch me. I won't let myself get dirty.""  
  
Soon, the sounds from downstairs became increasingly explicit.  
  
I hugged my body, feeling completely dead inside.  
  
Tears welled in my eyes but never fell.  
  
Time passed minute by minute as I curled up in the corner, neither daring to fall asleep nor willing to face reality.  
  
Not until midnight did Nathan unlock the door, acting as if nothing had happened.  
  
He casually tossed out: ""Oops, got so wrapped up in my work I totally forgot about you. Better get dressed before you catch cold.""  
  
He tossed me a robe like feeding scraps to a dog, then his phone suddenly rang.  
  
Looking down, he muttered, ""That's weird. Why's Grandma checking out of the hospital? Her condition hasn't improved.""  
  
I stayed silent.  
  
Just then, his phone buzzed again. In an instant, I caught a glimpse of a text that made my blood run cold:  
  
""Bro, those nude videos are doing wonders. Some loaded geezer already bid $300,000 grand‚Äîdude's pushing 70 years old! Stella's cherry-popping night is gonna be epic LMAO!""  
  
It hit me then‚Äîthere were hidden cameras in the bedroom.  
  
Everything. Every single thing had been recorded‚Äîmy nakedness, my humiliation, my screams after my dignity was crushed.  
  
My heart went numb, stunned into a cold stillness that felt like it would never thaw.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
""Take a shower. I'm taking you to an auction. Heard there's a special item everyone's after tonight. Let's check it out.""  
  
His words sent an electric shock through my body.  
  
""I'm not going. I don't want anything.""  
  
Hearing my refusal, his face instantly darkened: ""You're going whether you want to or not. All you do is stay home cooking and cleaning‚Äîpeople might think you're angling for the housekeeper's job. Get your ass out there and see how the real world works!""  
  
I looked at my ravaged hands and suddenly found it all absurd.  
  
All these years, to accommodate his germaphobia, I'd washed the sheets three times daily, laundered his clothes by hand.  
  
Turns out in his eyes I was nothing but... a maid.  
  
Seeing me lower my head in silence, his patience snapped completely. He shoved me into my designated ""disinfectant"" tub.  
  
After washing, he steeled himself to dry me off, disgust written plainly across his face.  
  
Once I was dry, he went through his own disinfection routine before dragging me to the car.  
  
At the auction venue, people mingled with drinks, buzzing about the upcoming event.  
  
As soon as she spotted me, Zoey rushed over with a smile, examining my hands carefully.  
  
Both hands, long exposed to disinfectant, were pale with a reddish tinge, skin paper-thin and covered in rashes.  
  
""Pfft, what delicate hands you have, Stella. I hear Nathan can't even bear to touch you‚Äîprobably scared he'll break you or something?""  
  
Someone immediately burst out: ""Ha! More like he just doesn't want to touch her. I mean, come on‚Äîfive years married and still a virgin?""  
  
Another round of roaring laughter rose in waves, mercilessly drowning me.  
  
I frowned, my face burning with humiliation, and spoke coldly: ""You done?""  
  
Nathan clicked his tongue, his dark eyes filled with displeasure: ""They're complimenting you. Don't be ungrateful.""  
  
Seeing my expression still hadn't softened, one of the guys at the table picked up a glass and handed it to me:  
  
""Come on, Stella, don't be such a buzzkill. He was just hyping you up. Here, try this‚Äîit's expensive stuff.""  
  
I looked around. Every pair of eyes was fixed on me.  
  
I remembered that their plan to auction off my virginity tonight.  
  
Coldly pushed away the offered glass, I said, ""I don't drink.""  
  
Nathan's knuckles whitened around his glass, barely holding back his anger:  
  
""Fine, refusing a toast only to drink a forfeit. This is exactly why I say you've lost your damn mind cooped up at home‚Äîcan't take a joke, won't drink, what the hell do you want?""  
  
I took a step back, meeting his gaze with deadly seriousness:  
  
""That's my question. What the hell do you want, Nath‚Äî""  
  
Before I could finish, I felt a sharp sting‚Äîa needle jabbing into my lower back.

1kjcnww,https://i.redd.it/6zyvqz6o1zze1.jpeg,Shades of coffee steam valve early review,"Received it a few days ago. 
Only took 15 minutes to install. (Never disassembled the machine before.)

SoC installation video tutorial is very clear. My old valve was tricky to remove (machine is 2 years old), just like they warn in the video, but if you prepare the right tools, you'll get the job done. 

On the actual usage - it doesn't drip, so that's a big win. :) Also, I swear the steam power improved, I guess the leaking also causes a slight loss of pressure on an already weak steam GCP.

On the stiffness - yes, the SoC valve feels less smooth than the stock one, but it doesn't annoy me at all. It's more of ""different"" feel than ""bad"" feel. 

SoC valve also has one advantage that no one mentiones compared to stock. The steam cuts off a slight turn before it feels fully shut. So you don't have to apply any physical effort to close it. Which will probably prolong it's life.

tl:dr - If you were on the fence, it's worth it. The stock replacement valve isn't much cheaper and installation is straightforward if you watch the tutorial videos in advance.",6,1746890281.0,gaggiaclassic,0,1.0,False

I actually arrived at the church on time (miracle), found parking near the entrance (double miracle), said hello to the few family members I recognized, and then the whole ordeal began.

After about 20 minutes of standing and pretending to follow along, I thought: fuck it. I told my mom I‚Äôd be outside, slipped out, got in my car, and drove to the nearest gas station for coffee and cigarettes. I figured no one will even notice I‚Äôm gone, right? 

Well. When I came back, there was a freaking ambulance in the church driveway. WTF.

Turns out some guy had fainted right next to my family and hit his head. Hence the ambulance.  
And yeah ‚Äì the mass just carried on like nothing happened.

I decided to lie and told my family I‚Äôd gone back to the car to grab my power bank because my phone was dying.

BUT THEN. One of my cousins (that sneaky bastard ‚Äî he had shown up super late on purpose, as he later admitted without a shred of remorse) had seen me driving off to the gas station. So when people finally noticed I was missing, he just went:  
‚ÄúMrijka? Don‚Äôt worry, we saw her in her car earlier. She‚Äôs probably having trouble parking or something.‚Äù

So even though I had successfully hidden the cigarette butt and the coffee cup in my bag, I still had to confess the truth, because I was too dumb and panicked to come up with a second lie on the spot.

So yeah.  
I admitted I went for coffee in the middle of the mass.  
The silence was awkward as fuck.

Jesus Christ.

Super good videos that gave me the FO76 itch. So, I paid the fallout 1st subscription and got on to try and raid for the 1st time, my toon was level 326 bloodied heavy gunner, completely not setup for the raid. On 5/7/2025, I acquired the last piece of best in slot gear that was available from the raid and no longer need to raid, which was the emergency protocols mod for the torso Vulcan power armor. I went from a full overeater's with random stats on a T65 with a Bloodied explosive .50Cal to an infinite VATS build with Full Overeater's Vulcan armor, +2 AGI on my 2nd star for all pieces, thru-hikers on all pieces, and then I decided to do a mix of Limit Breakers, Scanners, Aegis, for my 4 star (3LB, 1 SC, 2AEG) with the brand new Gatling Plasma meta gun (new mods included) with the bloodied effect, increase in attack speed, reduction in AP drain, and Conductors. I was even able to get the new Gimbal mods for the Vulcan PA arms that increase accuracy from hip fire and sighted fire. I can make all Vulcan PA and at this point pretty sure any mod that came out for the PA in the raid. I'm now level 525 and the amount of mod boxes I have is a little nuts. (5 Conductors!)

\*\*I did all of this while still going across state lines on one of those weekends to see family. I also did this after work, I work from 7am to 5pm, M-F. I did this by starting the raids MYSELF rather than trying to join a raid or waiting for a raid. I made sure I watched the videos as I'm an old raider and still have the mindset of knowing before experiencing the raid, Thanks WoW... I server hopped if there wasn't enough interest in raiding on that server and BOOM! Best in slot in like two weeks, which is pretty awesome for FO76, Bethesda loves the long grind for its player base but they are definitely loosing up with this ideology in the raid.

Sure there were some ignorant peoples and even rude peoples, but they would ALWAYS excuse themselves at some point in the raid allowing more friendlier waster landers to join and get it done. Or I trained them on how to raid. Most of this was done without comms too. So, be patient and persevere my waste landers.

I had my first psychiatrist meeting on thursday morning and i was so nervous. 

For some reason i woke up feeling so insanely depressed, like more than usual. I cried the whole journey there and while i was in the waiting room. I‚Äôm a big crier i cry a lot, but this - was the most i‚Äôve ever cried, it was uncontrollable. 

When the psychiatrist called me in i couldn‚Äôt speak for the first 15 mins i had to get my mom to speak for me because i was incoherent. I told him about how i was feeling and i gave him more or less a backstory on my life up till this point and he was very understanding and he truly validated that i‚Äôve been through a lot in my life. 

We talked without my mom for a while and eventually i was laughing through tears. We decided on 6 weeks of therapy to begin and take it from there. 

Afterwards i was still crying lol anf my mom took me to get coffee and a giant cookie, i felt like a kid but in a really good way. We went home and i went to sleep because i was so exhausted and had slept 2 hours the night before.

Thing that I liked in particular is that there is no minimum spend (Have got the discount on as low as Rs 280 purchase) and there is no limit on how many times you can get the discount. Although not sure how long this deal will be there.",2,1746889763.0,CreditCardsIndia,1,1.0,False

Getting out of the locker room Xavier met back with Drew, changed back into his casual wear and his gear back in his bag. The two of them stood in the Kimyo martial arts building and the older of the two began to praise the winner.

‚ÄúHell yeah dude! Told ya it‚Äôd be fine. You won that thing handedly and the crown fixed you right up.‚Äù

‚ÄúI feel like if I even trip, I‚Äôll lay on the floor comatose for the rest of the day.‚Äù

‚ÄúEh. Have some electrolytes, you‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù Drew handed his friend a sports drink to have. Xavier took the bottle and opened it to down it as fast as he could.

The gulps he got felt like a shock back to stability for himself, but he knew that it was a temporary one and that he needed better rest.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù a third voice came to join the conversation.

He seemed to be a Japanese man, a little bit taller than Xavier but not as tall as Drew. Probably around the same age as Drew. Black short hair and some blue eyes, deeper in color than what was usual, with a fairly well shaped build to him. He stood a respectable distance from them while still being close enough.

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù Xavier responded. He questioned on why the man wanted to talk to them.

‚ÄúThe name‚Äôs Rin Kusakabe, they call me ‚ÄòThe Blue Oni‚Äô.‚Äù

‚ÄòAh.‚Äô Drew and Xavier thought, both also tensing up a bit.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the Red Oni‚Äôs brother right?‚Äù Drew asked.

‚ÄúYep.‚Äù He responded.

Drew put some steel into his voice spoke some more, ‚ÄúLook, your brother lost fair and square. If you want to get a get-back you‚Äôll have to mess with me too, and I‚Äôm not a human.‚Äù

Rin put a small hand up in his defense, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm after. My younger brother is a big boy and he‚Äôll be fine. He can sleep the loss off. I just want to talk to him a bit.‚Äù He nodded a over to Xavier.

The two relaxed a bit. Since a fight was coming they didn‚Äôt have much to worry about. They also both thought ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre the older brother?‚Äô The size difference was a bit jarring for them.

‚ÄúWhat do you want to talk about?‚Äù Xavier walked closer and asked.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm from the ‚ÄòOni-Family Gym‚Äô. We try to find good talent and honestly you did a good job. Usually just because you beat one of our own doesn‚Äôt mean we take interest, even if it was someone from the family. But you‚Äôre human and you just beat Matthew ‚Äì *That‚Äôs* impressive. So, I thought it might be a good idea to extend a hand. You could join us and get more fame and experience than you could continuing solo. What do you say?‚Äù

The only one that seemed to be impressed by the offer was Drew, his eyes widened by the surprise of it. Xavier‚Äôs face remained neutral however.

He gave his response, ‚ÄúThanks but, I don‚Äôt do gyms.‚Äù

Drew looked his way, raised an eyebrow but didn‚Äôt push on the choice.

On Rin‚Äôs face was a look annoyance, a bit of confusion but mostly annoyance.

He asked, ‚ÄúReally? You don‚Äôt do gyms?‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, not my thing.‚Äù Xavier was still plain faced, even his voice was neutral.

Rin stood and paused for a moment, ‚ÄúLet me ask you a personal question then: Why do you do this then?‚Äù

*Now* Xavier was the confused one, ‚ÄúDo‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúThese fights. I doubt it‚Äôs for the money ‚Äì you have talent items, you‚Äôre either already rich or have connections. So why do you fight in them?‚Äù

Xavier merely gave a shrug and an answer, ‚ÄúPartly what you already said: The experience. I need to learn how to better fight and these help me while not being too dangerous.‚Äù

At his words Rin‚Äôs face now became‚Ä¶ slanted. There were a few different feelings in it, but it was jumbled up and hard to tell. Xavier would even swear he saw his blue eyes glow ever so slightly. Then he spoke once more.

‚ÄúKid, let me give you some words; Fighting by yourself like this doesn‚Äôt really help, because it doesn‚Äôt have any meaning to it. If you want to get power, you have to test yourself more and more, you have to get pushed by those around you. Fighting like *this*, it‚Äôs always gonna be on your own terms and you can always just quit. You‚Äôve got to put some true purpose into your efforts and you‚Äôve got to find out why you *actually* want to get stronger, else you‚Äôre not gonna grow.‚Äù Rin then turned and left; a single wave was his goodbye.

Xavier blinked a few times. Something was racking his brain, something within Kusakabe‚Äôs words were reaching him. He was questioning.

Drew stood there, he didn‚Äôt make any arguments for or against. He just stood beside as he saw him be confused.

‚Äú‚Ä¶You‚Äôre really not going to take the offer?‚Äù

Xavier gave glance, snapping back, ‚ÄúEh, they probably just want to figure out my gear nothing actual.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe. Come lets get going.‚Äù

The two walked outside and back over to Drew‚Äôs car, getting in and Drew driving out. Xavier laid back in his seat to rest. Looking out the window and talking to a nagging thought that was in his head.

\-

The drive wasn‚Äôt too long; enough time to rest but not too much for boredom. They arrived at the house of one of Xavier‚Äôs friends and was his dropped off. He got out of the car and said his peace to Drew as the latter drove off to handle other things.

He entered the home ‚Äì not needing to knock ‚Äì and saw his friends hanging out on the L-shaped couch.

On one seat was Lucas DeSilva, messing with a floating ball of water he conjured up. He was tan-skinned, had auburn hair that went a bit past his neck, and had a soul-patch on his chin. Relaxing as he usually did and in his typical casual wear.

Next to him was Zack Monroe, playing through an FPS. Hair styled in a short mohawk, wearing his black punk shirt and jeans. For being a kimyo though he was short, coming in at 5‚Äô7 at most, and he obviously didn‚Äôt have the body of a fighter, his skin was almost even pale from how much he spent indoors.

‚ÄúSup,‚Äù was all he needed to say to his friends. He left his pack on the floor and plopped onto the longest section of the couch, laying full-body on it.

Lucas gave the most heard response, ‚ÄúXavie! Welcome back man!‚Äù and Zack merely gave a ‚ÄúSup,‚Äù for his friend.

The three of them have been friends for a while. Xavier knew Zack since they were eight, and had been friends ever since. They met Lucas in their sophomore year of high school, he was a new student to the school, and they started to hang. The three had become a tight-knit friend group and had even decided to go to the same community college after graduation. They hung out together and go to the same college together. ¬†

‚ÄúHow was the fight friend? You get the pay-day?‚Äù Lucas asked.

‚ÄúI won; Paycheck‚Äôs in my bag.‚Äù Xavier gave a half-gesture to his bag in his answer.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt get too beat up did you?‚Äù Zack asked this time as he still played.

‚ÄúNothing the crown could heal. Thing drained me though, gonna be burned out for a bit.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo bad you don‚Äôt have chi,‚Äù Zack continued, ‚ÄúCould actually fuel it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah and a talent would be really helpful too ‚Äì no shit numbs nuts,‚Äù Xavier snipped at his friend. Zack snorted at the anger.

Xavier laid back and rested some more, absent mindedly watching the game Zack was playing. In his mind he was having some repeating thoughts, nagging ideas that he couldn‚Äôt let go. Talking to himself ultimately.

He looked towards his friends and continued his thoughts.

‚ÄúHey ‚Äì if you guys could start up your own gym, would you?‚Äù

The question got both of their attention, and confusion.

‚ÄúLike for working out?‚Äù Lucas asked.

‚ÄúNo, I mean ‚Äì a kimyo gym. For fights and all that.‚Äù

Lucas pause for a moment, pinching his chin and wondering, ‚ÄúMmmh. It depends: if I have some decent help and you guys around it might be cool. I‚Äôd be interested.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd just like another place to hang out, wouldn‚Äôt you?‚Äù Xavier chuckled and smiled at his friend.

¬†‚ÄúAre you actually thinking about opening up you own gym, Xavie?‚Äù Lucas quirked a brow up at his friend.

Xavier sat up a bit and rubbed the back of his neck, ‚ÄúI-its just some‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a ‚Äòwhat if‚Äô thing you know? Just some maybe-‚Äù

Lucas cut in, ‚Äú-Xavie, why would *YOU* want to open up a gym?‚Äù

Xavier was pushed into an actual position now, ‚Äú‚Ä¶the same reason I‚Äôm doing the fights: To get better at fighting. You know, so I can follow in my dad‚Äôs footsteps.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Lucas said, ‚ÄúWell, if you did start up gym I think it‚Äôd be fun to join. Maybe I could actually cut loose with my talent for once.‚Äù To enunciate his point he spun his finger in a wide circle above him a summoned more water to float in the air, it following his finger and rippling there.

Zack then paused his game and set his controller on the coffee table in front of him, ‚ÄúPersonally ‚Äì I‚Äôd maybe join. I‚Äôd like to get a few ranks in, get some skill in my talent.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo ‚Äì you guys would join me in joining a gym.‚Äù It was less a question a more Xavier speaking out loud. He slowly was starting to convince himself. He didn‚Äôt want to *join* a gym; he was still human and his power was based on his Talent Items ‚Äì not compatible with many gyms and he couldn‚Äôt trust most near his gear. But the idea of being apart of one tempted him. Whether it was always there or something about Ren‚Äôs words for earlier convincing him, he didn‚Äôt know.

*‚Äò‚Ä¶why you Actually want to get stronger.‚Äô*

‚ÄúMaybe we can do it,‚Äù he said out loud once more.

Zack however started to interrupt, ‚ÄúOkay, l-listen. As fun as an idea as this all sound, could we actually do it? Like, legitimately. There a bunch of things that we need to deal with before we can even start training: We‚Äôll need a building, equipment, other people other than us. Well need a BUNCH of money to even start working towards it and I doubt you‚Äôve saved-up enough. Hell, we‚Äôll need an actual trainer to help us. Neither of you two are the best fighters or teachers, and my Obelisk is really that good for any combat, much less in a ring.‚Äù

Xavier was pause by Zack‚Äôs points. He took a bit to think, chewing on his tongue to figure it out.

‚ÄúWell ‚Äì there‚Äôs always my dad‚Äôs connections. We could get the K.O.D.E to give us some starter funding, maybe. We could also start low on the equipment side, we don‚Äôt need a lot of gear, just enough to help use train. As for a trainer‚Ä¶. Drew help us.‚Äù

At the last part both Lucas and Zack rolled their eyes. They were friends with Drew as well, but that also meant that they knew him. They knew he was the right choice, but not their favorite one; He was what they needed but not what they wanted.

Xavier added some backing to his words, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs strong, knows what to do, and he‚Äôs got connections himself. He‚Äôd be a help.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, yeah,‚Äù Lucas said, ‚ÄúSo, we got the vagueities of a plan set. We going in on this.‚Äù He gave a smile to his two friends, looking between the two waiting for an answer.

Zack gave a few more words out, ‚ÄúOkay, listen: Maybe this could work out but, to what end? How long are we going to do this for? Xavier look, I can see Lucas going into this, he‚Äôd fit well, make a career out of it. Me though. You know how I am; this isn‚Äôt exactly my thing man. What‚Äôs the end point of this, what‚Äôs the goal to this really?‚Äù

Xavier‚Äôs lips parsed a bit before the right words came out, ‚ÄúTo see how high we can climb.‚Äù He looked his friend in the eyes as he said that, and a memory came out between the both of them. Zack face looked a bit in pain as he realized the point he made. His dropped down before he gave in, ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm in‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing this?‚Äù Xavier asked his two friends.

‚ÄúIf isn‚Äôt any problems setting it all up than yeah, I‚Äôm sticking around.‚Äù That was Zack‚Äôs answer.

‚ÄúOf course, man, come on? Man! This is gonna be sick!‚Äù That was Lucas‚Äôs answer.

Xavier gave one last smile, ‚ÄúAlright then. We‚Äôre doing it.‚Äù

The first steps of the climb were taken.

Chapter 1: Abandoned the Engagement Ceremony   
  
Standing in front of the mirror at Silver Rose Bridal Shop, I watched as Linda, the stylist, fussed over my engagement dress.    
  
The delicate silk fabric flowed like moonlight against my skin, making my silver-white hair shimmer under the boutique's warm lighting.   
  
""You two are simply perfect together!"" Linda gushed as she adjusted the dress's hem. ""The heir of Silver Moon Pack and the heir of Storm Pack - it's like a fairy tale!""   
  
I couldn't help but smile at her words. Alex and I had come such a long way from our days at the orphanage.   
  
""We grew up together in the neutral territory orphanage,"" I explained, watching Linda's eyes widen with interest. ""Neither of us knew our true identities until we were fifteen.""   
  
""Oh my! What a beautiful story!"" Linda clasped her hands together excitedly. ""Found by your respective packs and discovering you're both heirs! And then becoming mates at eighteen - it's destiny!""   
  
The memory of that moment when we both awakened as wolves and felt our mate bond snap into place still made my heart flutter.    
  
Looking at my reflection, I touched the crescent moon birthmark on my collarbone - the mark that had identified me as the true heir of Silver Moon Pack.   
  
""The young girls in both packs are so envious,"" Linda continued as she worked. ""You're their ideal love story - childhood sweethearts who turned out to be destined mates!""   
  
I smiled softly, remembering how Alex had always protected me at the orphanage. Even before we knew what we were to each other, he had been my guardian, my rock.   
  
""The engagement party is in three days, right?"" Linda asked, pinning up another section of the dress.   
  
""Yes, both packs will be there to celebrate,"" I confirmed, excitement bubbling in my chest.   
  
The fitting room door opened slightly, and Alex poked his head in. His storm-gray eyes lit up when he saw me.   
  
""You look stunning,"" he breathed, stepping fully into the room. He was already dressed in his engagement suit, looking devastatingly handsome.   
  
Linda excused herself with a knowing smile, leaving us alone. Alex approached me slowly, his eyes drinking in every detail.   
  
""I can't believe you're mine,"" he whispered, wrapping his arms around my waist from behind. His lips found my neck, sending shivers down my spine.   
  
I turned in his arms, bringing my hands up to his chest. ""We've come so far from those days at the orphanage...""   
  
His lips were just about to meet mine when his phone rang shrilly. The moment shattered as he pulled back to check the screen.   
  
I saw Isabella's name flash across it before he answered. My good mood instantly evaporated.   
  
""What's wrong?"" Alex's voice was tense as he listened. ""Isabella, calm down...""   
  
I could hear her hysterical voice through the speaker. ""Since you're going to propose anyway, you don't need me anymore! I'm in so much pain... I can't take it anymore!""   
  
Rolling my eyes, I stepped away from Alex. ""Another suicide threat? How original.""   
  
Alex shot me a pleading look, but before he could respond, his phone pinged with a message. The color drained from his face as he looked at it.   
  
""She's in the bathtub... she's cut her wrists..."" he muttered, already moving toward the door.   
  
I grabbed his arm. ""Don't you dare leave! She does this every time we try to be intimate. She's never actually hurt herself - it's all manipulation!""   
  
""Aurora, please understand,"" Alex begged, his eyes torn. ""I have to make sure she's okay. We still have three days until the engagement party. I'll be back in time, I promise.""   
  
""If you walk out that door today, there won't be an engagement,"" I threatened, my voice cold.   
  
He hesitated for a moment, then gently removed my hand from his arm. ""I'll make it up to you. I just need to handle this.""   
  
I stood there in my beautiful engagement dress, watching Alex's back as he rushed out of the bridal shop without a second glance.    
  
My hands trembled as I tried to hold back the tears threatening to spill.   
  
Linda, the stylist, knocked gently on the fitting room door. ""Miss Aurora, are you alright? Would you like help removing the dress?""   
  
""Yes, please,"" I managed to whisper, my voice barely steady.   
  
As Linda helped me out of the dress, I couldn't stop thinking about how Isabella always seemed to have perfect timing.    
  
Every intimate moment between Alex and me was interrupted by her dramatic suicide threats.   
  
""Such a shame Mr. Storm had to leave so suddenly,"" Linda commented sympathetically while hanging up the dress. ""The dress looks absolutely stunning on you.""   
  
I didn't respond. What could I say? That my fianc√© had just abandoned me for another woman? Again?   
  
Once alone in the changing room, I began removing my makeup with trembling hands. The carefully applied foundation and mascara smeared under my angry swipes.   
  
A soft knock interrupted my thoughts. ""Aurora? It's Hazel.""   
  
Relief flooded through me at the sound of my best friend's voice. Hazel walked in, her emerald eyes filled with concern.   
  
""Alex called me,"" she explained, pulling me into a tight hug. ""That i\*\*\*t cousin of mine asked me to keep you company.""   
  
I let out a bitter laugh. ""How thoughtful of him to arrange a babysitter.""   
  
Hazel's face darkened with anger. ""I can't believe he left you here for that manipulative witch again. I already gave him a piece of my mind over the phone.""   
  
""What did he say?"" I couldn't help but ask.   
  
""He just kept repeating that Isabella saved his life and he owes her,"" Hazel rolled her eyes. ""Come on, let's get out of here. You need food and a friend right now, not this fancy prison.""   
  
She practically dragged me to a nearby restaurant, ordering my favorite comfort foods without even looking at the menu.   
  
""Look,"" Hazel said gently as we waited for our food. ""I know Alex loves you. He's just... caught up in this twisted sense of obligation to Isabella.""   
  
Deep down, I knew she was right. Alex and I had grown up together, protected each other. He did love me. But knowing that didn't make his constant choice of Isabella over me hurt any less.   
  
Just as I was starting to calm down, my phone rang. Alex's name flashed across the screen.   
  
""Aurora?"" His voice was tense. ""Isabella's condition is critical. The doctors say she lost a lot of blood...""   
  
My heart dropped. ""What are you saying?""   
  
""I... I can't make it back in three days for the engagement ceremony. We'll have to postpone-""   
  
""Postpone?"" I cut him off, my voice rising. ""There will be no engagement in three days, Alex. And there won't be one in the future either!""   
  
""Aurora, be sensible,"" he sighed in that condescending tone I'd grown to hate. ""Don't make a fuss about this. I have to go.""   
  
The line went dead before I could respond. I stared at the screen,my hand shaking with rage.   
  
""Alright,that's it,"" Hazel declared,pulling me up from my seat. ""We're going to the club. You're drinking tonight, Aurora. I don't care if I have to carry you home. You're not sulking in this restaurant all night.""   
  
The club's music pounded like a steady drumbeat against my skull, the rhythm doing little to drown out the chaos in my head.    
  
My hands gripped the edge of the bar as I swirled the amber liquid in my glass. Drink after drink burned down my throat,but none of it burned away the deep ache in my chest.   
  
""I can't believe this,"" I mumbled,more to myself than to Hazel,who was watching me with growing concern. ""Three days. Our engagement was three days away. And he‚Äîhe just... left.""   
  
Hazel placed her drink on the countertop with a sharp clink.    
  
""Aurora, the man's a fool, alright? And I swear,if you weren't already ripping him apart in your head,I would have marched straight to that hospital to knock some sense into him.‚Äù   
  
I laughed bitterly,tipping my glass back and polishing off the rest of the alcohol. ""Knocking sense into Alex? Good luck. If anyone knows how stubborn he is,it's me.‚Äù   
  
Hazel started to speak again,probably to tell me to slow down on the liquor,but I cut her off. ""Hazel,"" I said, setting my glass down harder than necessary.    
  
""Do you know what's the worst part? It wasn't just today. It wasn't just Isabel. This‚Äîthis whole thing has been building for years. And I let it happen.‚Äù   
  
Her frown deepened. ""Aurora,you can't blame yourself. You've given Alex more than anyone else ever has. More than he probably deserved,if we're being honest.‚Äù   
  
""Exactly!""I snapped,laughing humorlessly again. ""I gave him everything. Everything, Hazel.‚Äù   
  
Memories flooded back. I remembered being sixteen, standing before the Storm Pack council. They had sneered at me, called me 'that orphan girl from neutral territory.'   
  
""It's absurd that he should be considered as heir,"" one elder had said. ""An illegitimate pup with no ties to the Luna's line? It's an insult.""   
  
But I hadn't flinched. ""The moment Alex awakened as his wolf Asher, the pack bond recognized him. If the bond accepts him, why can't you?""   
  
I had found every loophole to force them to consider his candidacy. That day, Alex's name was put forward as a legitimate contender.   
  
""You're amazing, Aurora,"" he'd whispered afterward, gripping my hands tightly. ""I couldn't have done this without you.""   
  
But that was just the beginning.   
  
For two years after, I kept fighting his battles. When other heirs sabotaged his training, I stayed up helping him recover.    
  
When his Luna stepmother blocked his resources, I exposed her corruption. Every victory he'd achieved had come at a price - one I'd paid willingly.   
  
At eighteen, when our mate bond formed, I thought it had all been worth it. Destiny had written our story in the stars.   
  
""How did we get here,Hazel?""My voice cracked slightly,bringing me back to the present. ""I held his hand every step of the way,and now he's... he's holding someone else's.""   
  
Hazel softened visibly,leaning closer with a rare seriousness in her voice. "" You got him to the top, and now he's too blinded by guilt for Isabella to value what you've given him. But worse than that,""    
  
she hesitated, her tone gentler now, ""he might not even realize how much he's hurting you.‚Äù   
  
I wanted to argue,to fight back against her words,but I couldn't. It felt too raw,too true.   
  
I reached for yet another drink,but Hazel snatched it away before I could.    
  
""Come on,"" Hazel pulled me up. ""If you're going to drown your sorrows, we're doing it on the dance floor.""   
  
I threw myself into the crowd, letting the music batter through my thoughts. But eventually,the motion,the noise,the heat‚Äîthey overwhelmed me.   
  


# Chapter 2: Proposal to the Future Alpha King

Chapter 2: Proposal to the Future Alpha King   
  
(Aurora's POV)   
  
The club's pounding music and flashing lights were starting to make my head spin. Despite Hazel's attempts to get me dancing, I couldn't shake the crushing weight of betrayal pressing down on my chest.   
  
""I need to use the restroom,"" I mumbled to Hazel, pushing away from the crowded dance floor.   
  
She grabbed my arm, concern evident in her emerald eyes. ""Are you sure you can make it there alone? You've had quite a bit to drink...""   
  
I waved her off, trying to appear more steady than I felt. ""I'm fine. Just... wait here.""   
  
The world tilted dangerously as I made my way through the dimly lit corridor. My wolf, Cora, whined softly in my head, sharing my distress and disorientation.   
  
My thoughts drifted back to Alex. How many times had I supported him? How many battles had I fought to help him secure his position as heir?    
  
And this was how he repaid me ‚Äì by abandoning our engagement for Isabel's latest manipulation.   
  
""Alex..."" I whispered, tears blurring my vision. ""Why am I not enough?""   
  
The alcohol was making everything fuzzy around the edges. Through my tears, I spotted a tall figure at the end of the corridor. The familiar broad shoulders and commanding presence made my heart leap.   
  
""Alex?"" I called out, stumbling forward. ""You came back...""   
  
I practically fell against him, breathing in his scent. But something was different ‚Äì this wasn't Alex's usual storm and pine scent. This was deeper, more intense, like dark woods after midnight.   
  
""I knew you'd come back,"" I slurred, clinging to his shirt. ""You always protected me at the orphanage. Remember? You were the only one who cared...""   
  
My drunk mind didn't register his stiffness or silence. All I knew was that I needed to say what had been burning in my heart.   
  
""I love you so much,"" I confessed, tears falling freely now. ""But why do you keep choosing her? Am I not worth fighting for? After everything we've been through...""   
  
I lifted my face, intending to kiss him. But as I moved, I lost my balance again. Strong arms caught me before I could fall.   
  
The sudden movement brought me closer to him, and in my drunken state, I did something incredibly foolish ‚Äì I kissed him.   
  
For a split second, I felt him tense. Then, ever so slightly, he responded. His lips were firm but gentle against mine, nothing like Alex's familiar kisses.    
  
The scent of dark woods intensified, and something about it made Cora stir restlessly within me.   
  
Wait... this wasn't Alex's scent at all.   
  
I pulled back slightly, trying to focus my blurry vision. Instead of storm-gray eyes, I found myself staring into intense golden ones that seemed to glow in the dim light.   
  
This definitely wasn't Alex.   
  
The stranger's face was aristocratic and unfamiliar, his expression unreadable as he studied me. He was holding me carefully, like I might shatter if he gripped too hard.   
  
""I believe you have the wrong person,"" he said quietly, his voice deep and smooth.   
  
Mortification hit me like a bucket of ice water. I had just thrown myself at a complete stranger and kissed him!   
  
I tried to step back, but my legs weren't cooperating. I stumbled again, and once more, his strong arms prevented my fall.   
  
The combination of alcohol, embarrassment, and emotional exhaustion was too much. Before I could stop myself, I pressed my face against his chest and started crying.   
  
I felt his body stiffen at my continued proximity, but he didn't push me away. Instead, after a moment's hesitation, one of his hands started gently patting my back.   
  
""I'm so sorry,"" I sobbed into his obviously expensive shirt. ""I thought you were... I didn't mean to...""   
  
My words were cut off as another wave of dizziness hit me. The last thing I remembered was the feeling of being lifted, strong arms cradling me as if I weighed nothing.   
  
The stranger had picked me up in a princess carry, and through my alcohol-hazed mind, I caught a glimpse of his face ‚Äì beautiful but stern, those golden eyes still studying me with an intensity that made Cora whimper.   
  
Then everything went black.   
  
\--------   
  
A groggy haze wrapped itself around me like a suffocating blanket as consciousness slowly pulled me from the depths of sleep.    
  
I groaned and blinked against the sharp morning light spilling in through the windows.   
  
Where... was I?   
  
My eyes fluttered open fully, taking in the unfamiliar space around me. A modern, well-furnished living room. Soft, warm tones on the walls and polished wood floors.   
  
I was lying on a plush sofa, one I certainly didn't recognize. Someone had draped a blanket over me, and in front of me on the coffee table sat a steaming cup of tea, fragrant and inviting.   
  
My heart stuttered.   
  
""Alex?"" I called instinctively, the name slipping from my lips before I could stop it.   
  
The emptiness that greeted me in response hit like a punch to the stomach. And just like that, the events of last night slammed into me like a freight train.   
  
Alex. Isabella.   
  
The scene at the bridal shop. The brutal conversation over the phone. His forsaking me for her without a second thought.   
  
The pain in my chest returned full force. Only now it carried an entirely new blend of emotions.    
  
Shame burned hot on my cheeks as fresh, mortifying memories unraveled. The club. The stranger. That kiss.   
  
Oh god.   
  
Closing my eyes tightly, I curled further into the blanket, my breath hitching painfully. This hangover was nothing compared to the ache of betrayal that twisted deep in my chest.   
  
The soft click of a door opening startled me. I froze as heavy footsteps approached the living room.   
  
‚ÄúAh, you‚Äôre awake.‚Äù   
  
That voice‚Äîthe deep, commanding one from the corridor‚Äîsent an electric jolt through me.   
  
Opening my eyes, I hesitated, peeking. There he was. The man from last night.He offered me no smile, no apology for carrying me off like a stray cat the night before.    
  
Instead, he studied me with an expression I couldn‚Äôt quite read, holding that same calm authority that was unsettlingly steady.   
  
‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶‚Äù My voice shook. Like an i\*\*\*t, I trailed off before anything coherent formed. What could I even say?   
  
He arched a brow. ‚ÄúI was wondering if you‚Äôd remember.‚Äù   
  
I groaned inwardly, clutching at the blanket. Of course, he remembered.   
  
""You..."" I clutched the blanket tighter, mortification burning through my veins.   
  
The man's golden eyes studied me with an intensity that made me want to sink into the sofa and disappear. A teasing smile played at the corners of his lips.   
  
""I must say, that was quite an interesting way to introduce yourself last night,"" he said, his deep voice carrying a hint of amusement.   
  
I groaned, covering my face with my hands. ""I am so sorry about that. I was drunk and mistook you for someone else...""   
  
""Yes, I gathered that much when you started talking about the orphanage,"" he replied, settling into an armchair across from me.    
  
""Though I must admit, I'm curious about why such a beautiful female Alpha was drinking alone in a club.""   
  
My head snapped up at his words. How did he know I was an Alpha?   
  
As if reading my thoughts, he gestured to my crescent moon birthmark, visible above the neckline of my wrinkled dress. ""That mark is quite distinctive. If I'm not mistaken, you are the lost daughter of the Silver Moon Pack? The current Alpha heir?""   
  
I shifted uncomfortably under his piercing gaze. There was something familiar about him, but my hungover brain couldn't quite place it.   
  
He looked at me teasingly, ""It seems you don't remember who I am at all, which is regrettable, I even attended your return ceremony.""   
  
""Marcus?"" A plaintive howl echoed through my mind as Cora, my wolf, suddenly recognized him.   
  
The realization hit me like a bucket of ice water. Marcus Black - the heir to the Shadow Pack, the largest and most powerful wolf pack in existence. He had attended my return ceremony to Silver Moon Pack years ago.   
  
My face burned hotter. Not only had I drunkenly kissed a stranger, but I had kissed the future Alpha King!   
  
""I see recognition has finally dawned,"" Marcus said, his golden eyes glinting with amusement. ""Though I must say, your proposal last night was quite... unexpected.""   
  
""My what?"" I choked out.   
  
""Don't you remember?"" He leaned forward, his expression playful. ""You were quite insistent about wanting to marry me. Something about proving a point to someone named Alex? If I'm not mistaken, Alex is the Alpha heir of the Storm Pack? I heard he's your fianc√©? Am I right?""   
  
Oh god. Kill me now.   
  
But a defiant spark ignited in my chest at the mention of Alex's name. The pain and humiliation of his betrayal rushed back, fueling a reckless courage.   
  
""Well,"" I said, lifting my chin. ""The offer still stands.""   
  
Marcus's eyebrows shot up. ""Excuse me?""   
  
""You heard me,"" I met his gaze steadily. ""I'm proposing to you. Properly this time, without the alcohol.""   
  
He studied me for a long moment, then let out a low chuckle. ""You do realize that remarrying after a mate bond is illegal in wolf law?""   
  
""Who said anything about remarrying?"" I challenged. ""The mate bond with Alex was never officially registered with the Pack Council.""   
  
His expression turned serious. ""You're the heir to Silver Moon Pack, and I'm the heir to Shadow Pack. Do you even know who I am?""   
  
Cora howled again in my mind, and suddenly everything clicked into place. Marcus Black - Alex's greatest rival and the person he hated most.    
  
Not only was Marcus the legitimate heir to the most powerful pack, but he had everything Alex had always wanted - loving parents, unquestionable authority, and the respect of all wolf packs.   
  
A plan began forming in my mind. What better way to solve my engagement crisis and get back at Alex than by accepting a proposal from his worst enemy?   
  
""I know exactly who you are,"" I said, a determined glint in my eyes. ""And I think we could help each other.""   
  
Marcus leaned back, intrigued. ""How so?""   
  
""You need a Luna for your pack, don't you? I'm a pure-blooded Alpha female with healing abilities. And I..."" I took a deep breath. ""I have an engagement ceremony to attend three days later, I can‚Äôt cancel it.""   
  
""Ah,"" he said, understanding dawning in his eyes. ""So this is about revenge.""   
  
""Not just revenge,"" I argued, sitting up straighter. ""It's a mutually beneficial arrangement. I get to maintain my dignity and avoid a scandal, and you get a qualified Luna candidate for your pack.""   
  
Marcus's lips curved into an amused smile. ""You make an interesting case. But why should I choose you? Every Alpha's daughter would jump at the chance to be my Luna. You, on the other hand, are an orphan with a failed engagement and pack elders who are probably already plotting to remove you from your position.""   
  
His words stung, but I refused to let it show. My hand was already on the doorknob, ready to leave with whatever dignity I had left.   
  
""Thank you for your hospitality and the tea,"" I said coolly. ""I apologize again for last night's misunderstanding.""   
  
Just as I was about to turn the handle, his voice stopped me.   
  
""Aurora, wait.""   
  


# Chapter 3: Arranged Marriage

(Aurora's POV)   
  
""I cannot accept your dismissive attitude,"" I said firmly, turning away from the door to face Marcus. My pride as an Alpha female refused to let his words slide.   
  
Marcus lounged in his chair with casual elegance, his golden eyes tracking my every move. ""Oh? And why is that?""   
  
""Because you're wrong about me,"" I lifted my chin defiantly. ""Being an orphan doesn't make me weak. It made me stronger.""   
  
A flicker of interest crossed his aristocratic features. ""Enlighten me.""   
  
""You think I need your help? That I'm desperate?"" I let out a bitter laugh. ""I'm offering you a mutually beneficial arrangement. But if you're not interested, there are plenty of other options.""   
  
Marcus raised an eyebrow. ""Are there? With only three days until your supposed engagement party?""   
  
His words stung, but I wouldn't let him see how much they hurt. ""I would rather stand at that engagement ceremony and announce its cancellation myself than beg anyone for help.""   
  
Something shifted in his expression - was that respect?   
  
""That's quite bold,"" he commented, studying me with renewed interest. ""Most wolves in your position would be scrambling to save face.""   
  
""I'm not most wolves,"" I stated firmly. ""I'm the heir of Silver Moon Pack. And I'd rather face public humiliation with my head held high than crawl to anyone.""   
  
A small smile played at the corners of his mouth. ""Now that's more like the Alpha female I remember from your return ceremony.""   
  
I blinked, surprised by his words. ""You remember that?""   
  
""Of course,"" he nodded. ""You stood before the entire pack council at fifteen, claiming your birthright without a trace of fear. It was... impressive.""   
  
Memories of that day flooded back - standing before those stern faces, declaring my right to lead despite years away from the pack. I'd been terrified inside, but never showed it.   
  
""That same spirit is what helped Alex become heir,"" I said softly, more to myself than him. ""I fought every battle, cleared every obstacle...""   
  
Marcus's eyes narrowed slightly at the mention of Alex's name. ""Yes, I heard about your role in his rise to power. Quite the dedicated mate, weren't you?""   
  
The bitterness in his tone surprised me. ""You sound almost angry about it.""   
  
""Not angry,"" he corrected. ""Disappointed, perhaps. To see such strength and determination wasted on someone who clearly doesn't deserve it.""   
  
His words hit too close to home. I turned away, fighting back the sting of tears.   
  
""Well,"" I managed, keeping my voice steady. ""That's in the past now.""   
  
Marcus stood suddenly, his tall frame commanding attention. ""Is it? Are you truly ready to walk away from everything you built?""   
  
""I already have,"" I met his gaze squarely. ""The moment he chose Isabella over our engagement, he lost any claim to my loyalty.""   
  
A long moment passed as Marcus studied me, his golden eyes unreadable. Finally, he spoke.   
  
""Very well,"" he said quietly. ""I'll help you.""   
  
My heart leaped, but I forced myself to remain calm. ""What made you change your mind?""   
  
""Your pride,"" he answered simply. ""It's refreshing to meet someone who won't grovel, even when backed into a corner.""   
  
Hope flickered in my chest, but I stayed cautious. ""What's the catch?""   
  
""The catch?"" A slight smirk curved his lips. ""I don't just want an engagement, Aurora. I want marriage.""   
  
I stared at him, stunned. ""Marriage?""   
  
He said it as casually as commenting on the weather, his golden eyes never leaving my face. ""Yes. A proper union, not just a show for revenge.""   
  
""But... why?"" I stammered, thrown off by his sudden proposal.   
  
Marcus shrugged elegantly. ""My family has been pressuring me to choose a Luna. You're a pure-blooded Alpha female with impressive abilities. It makes sense.""   
  
I studied him carefully, noting his perfect features, commanding presence, and the power that seemed to radiate from him. Hazel had once called him the sexiest man in all the territories, and I could see why.   
  
His eyes darkened slightly as he caught me staring, and I quickly looked away, flustered.   
  
""Wouldn't this be detrimental to you?"" I asked, trying to regain my composure. ""My pack isn't exactly in the best position, and my status...""   
  
""My family doesn't need to marry for connections,"" he cut me off smoothly. ""Besides, having a stable Luna would reassure the packs under my rule.""   
  
I understood his meaning. There had been rumors about Marcus - whispers that the most mysterious seer among the wolf packs had prophesied he would never find his true mate.    
  
It had made some pack members uneasy about his future leadership.   
  
As I considered his offer, I weighed the benefits. His wealth and power would help stabilize my pack. It would let me defy Alex publicly. I could even share the burden of managing my parents' pack with Sarah...   
  
But life had taught me to be wary of things that seemed too perfect.   
  
My hand returned to the doorknob, ready to leave while my reason was still intact.    
  
""Thank you for the hospitality and the tea. I apologize again for the misunderstanding last night, and regarding the suggestion just now, I think we were a bit impulsive, so I'll pretend I never heard it.""   
  
Just as I turned around, his voice stopped me again.   
  
""Aurora, wait.""   
  
I sighed deeply in my heart, turned around slowly again, and looked at him, and there was even a trace of secret joy in my heart?    
  
Marcus's insight was as sharp as a blade. His golden eyes narrowed slightly as he studied my face, obviously noticing my unease about the marriage proposal.   
  
""You're hesitating,"" he said softly. ""Let me explain something.""   
  
He stood up, walked over to me and took my wrist, ""If you can, please sit down and listen to me.""    
  
I obediently sat down on the couch. And I watched as he gracefully settled back into his chair.    
  
Even that simple movement carried an air of authority that made my wolf Cora stir restlessly.   
  
""The main reason for this proposal is my grandmother,"" Marcus revealed, his expression softening slightly at the mention of her. ""She raised me after my parents became too busy with pack duties.""   
  
This was news to me. I'd always assumed the heir to the Shadow Warriors had a perfect upbringing.   
  
""That prophecy about me never finding a mate?I believe you have also heard about it."" He continued, his voice taking on a bitter edge. ""It's been weighing heavily on her. She falls ill frequently, worrying about my future.""   
  
His vulnerability in that moment caught me off guard. It was strange seeing this powerful man show such genuine concern for his grandmother.   
  
""She raised you?"" I asked softly.   
  
Marcus nodded, his golden eyes distant. ""My parents are very loving and love me very much. But when I was young, they were also very busy, it was my grandmother,she gave up everything to ensure I would become a worthy heir. Now in her old age, her only wish is to see me find a mate.""   
  
Something in his voice made my chest tighten. I understood what it meant to carry the weight of others' expectations.   
  
""That's why I'm proposing this arrangement,"" he continued, his business-like tone returning. ""It would give her peace of mind, and solve your current... situation.""   
  
He pulled out a document from his briefcase. ""I've already drawn up a prenuptial agreement. Everything will be clearly defined and transparent.""   
  
""Overnight, you drafted a document?"" I was a little surprised, ""You're not even sure you really need this document.""    
  
""This is the difference between me and others, isn't it?A Alpha king has never waged an unprepared war."" He chuckled lightly, ""So, shall we take a look? Confused little wolf.""   
  
I took the papers with trembling hands. The terms were surprisingly generous - protection for my pack, shared resources, clear guidelines for dissolution if needed.   
  
""This would be an arranged marriage,"" Marcus stated firmly. ""We would both maintain our independence while fulfilling our duties. Your wishes would be respected.""   
  
His methodical approach and open transparency began easing my doubts. This wasn't some emotional entanglement - it was a practical solution.   
  
""You've thought this through,"" I murmured, scanning the documents.   
  
""I always do,"" he replied simply. ""The Shadow Warriors don't act without careful planning.""   
  
I weighed the benefits in my mind. Protection for my weakened pack from one of the strongest territories.    
  
An alliance that would silence my critics. A mate who seemed more interested in pack politics than emotional complications.   
  
And yes, the satisfaction of showing Alex exactly what he had lost...   
  
The power of the Shadow Warriors behind me would ensure no one could challenge my position again. It was almost perfect.   
  
Almost.   
  
Because there was one complication I couldn't ignore - the way Cora kept reaching for Marcus's wolf.    
  
My animal side's unusual responsiveness to him made me wary. This supposedly purely political arrangement felt more complicated than it should.   
  
Marcus must have sensed my hesitation. He leaned forward, his golden eyes intense.   
  
""There's something else you should know,"" he said quietly. ""The Shadow Warriors have an ancient ritual - a modified mate bond that can be dissolved if both parties agree.""   
  
My breath caught. ""What?""   
  
""It's more like a pack alliance than a traditional mate bond,"" he explained. ""But there's a catch - we must live as true mates for one year before it can be dissolved.""   
  
""What do you mean by a true mate? What kind are you referring to?"" My voice was a bit shrill, and my face felt warm, so I'm sure it was flushed.   
  
""Don't misunderstand, we just live together in the pack house and handle pack business together. I won't force you to do anything else."" Marcus smiled and teased me.   
  
As he spoke, our wolves kept reaching for each other, adding an undercurrent of tension to our supposedly businesslike discussion. The air between us felt charged with something I wasn't ready to acknowledge.   
  
""I think... this does sound like a good choice."" I was a bit hesitant, and Cora was quite displeased with my hesitation, howling in my heart, making me feel rather strange, ""Alex is our destined partner, why are you not accepting him now?""   
  
""We don't want wavering partners,"" Cora roared.   
  
""So, confused little wolf, what is your choice?"" Markus looked at me quietly.",1,1746889661.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

""Freya, Mr. Whitemore signed off on your resignation papers, but he didn't notice it was you leaving. Want me to let him know?"" The HR director's voice came through the phone, concern evident.  
  
Freya's eyes lowered as she replied softly, ""No need. Just leave it as is.""  
  
""But you've been his right hand for four years! He values you more than anyone and totally depends on you. Are you absolutely sure about quitting?""  
  
HR was practically begging, but Freya just offered a small smile.  
  
""Nobody's irreplaceable in this world. My parents aren't doing well, and I need to head back home to settle down. Since Mr. Whitemore approved it, I'll handle the transition. I'll be gone in a month. Thanks for checking.""  
  
After hanging up, Freya went back to sorting through her things. She'd lived in this penthouse for three years. Not too much stuff, not too little‚Äîjust keeping essentials and tossing the rest.  
  
As the room emptied, she felt momentarily disoriented, memories washing over her like waves.  
  
Eight years ago, Freya‚Äîa small-town girl from a modest family‚Äîgot into Harvard and became best friends with New York heiress Elena Whitemore.  
  
Despite their completely different backgrounds, they clicked instantly‚Äîattending lectures together, grabbing lunch, hitting the shops‚Äîpractically joined at the hip every day.  
  
Gradually, Elena brought Freya into her world, introduced her to family, and unwittingly, Freya fell hard for Elena's brother, Jasper. But she buried those feelings deep, never breathing a word to anyone.  
  
After graduation, Elena took off to study in Paris. Freya stayed in New York, landed a job as Jasper's assistant‚Äîall to be near him.  
  
Then came that night when someone slipped something into Jasper's drink. Freya was about to call 911 when he pinned her against the wall, his control gone as his mouth claimed hers.  
  
After a night together, she woke to find him by the window, his sharp profile haloed in cigarette smoke, brooding and distant.  
  
Hearing her stir, he turned. ""You're into me, aren't you?""  
  
Freya instinctively wanted to deny it, but he continued, his face expressionless.  
  
""You blush whenever I walk in. You know all my likes and dislikes. You jumped at becoming my assistant right after graduation...""  
  
""Don't tell me that's all coincidence.""  
  
His words left her face burning, from embarrassment or guilt, she wasn't sure which.  
  
In the heavy silence, he suddenly handed her a card.  
  
""Last night shouldn't have happened. I'm in love with someone else and can't return your feelings or take responsibility. Elena mentioned you come from a modest background‚Äîthere's enough money on this card to set you up for life. Let's both forget this ever happened.""  
  
Freya was stunned. Then she remembered he'd repeatedly called out a name in bed: Mia. Mia Carter.  
  
From Elena, Freya knew Mia was Jasper's unforgettable first love. He was so hung up on her that even after she dumped him and moved abroad, collecting a string of rumored boyfriends, he insisted on waiting for her return.  
  
Freya recalled Elena's eye-roll: ""The Whitemores are known for being cold fish. How did my brother turn into such a hopeless romantic? Waiting all these years, saying everyone else would be 'settling' because he refuses to settle.""  
  
Feeling this in her bones, Freya suddenly found her courage and called after Jasper as he headed for the door.  
  
""I don't want your money. I just want a chance. Please, just try being with me. If she never comes back or... if she does return but you still can't move on, I'll walk away. I promise.""  
  
Faced with her lovesick gaze, Jasper paused for a beat before muttering, ""Whatever,"" and walking out.  
  
From that day forward, Freya was his assistant by day and his lover by night. They left their mark in his office, his Maybach, against the windows of his penthouse. Four years passed with no one knowing about their arrangement, and she told herself she was happy.  
  
Until his birthday a few days ago. Freya had planned several surprises to celebrate. But as midnight approached, instead of Jasper, she got a notification from his social media‚Äîan account he'd never used before.  
  
""Best birthday gift? Getting back what I lost.""  
  
The forever-silent Jasper Whitemore had posted a photo of himself kissing Mia Carter beneath exploding fireworks.  
  
Seeing this, the blood drained from Freya's face, her chest tightening. With one last desperate hope, she called him.  
  
Mia answered. After saying ""hello"" several times to silence, she called out: ""Jasper, who's this Freya Kingsley calling you and not saying anything?""  
  
A moment later, his deep, cool voice came through the speaker: ""Nobody important. Ignore it. Come back to bed, babe.""  
  
In that moment, Freya knew her exit cue had arrived.  
  
She packed her things, ready to leave, when she ran into Jasper at the door. Since they'd been sleeping together regularly, Freya had been staying at his place for convenience‚Äîbut now, she couldn't stay another night.  
  
Seeing her with her bags, his eyes narrowed slightly, but he made no move to stop her. ""Found a place?""  
  
""Yeah, my old apartment. Talked to the landlord‚Äîjust for a month.""  
  
At this, Jasper frowned. ""A month? What for?""  
  
Freya started to explain, but he seemed to lose interest, merely saying, ""I'll drive you.""  
  
She tried to refuse, but he insisted.  
  
""It's dumping snow out there, and it's late. If anything happened to you, Elena would kill me.""  
  
Freya reluctantly got into his car. Once, they'd been intimate countless times in this vehicle, but now she barely recognized it. The interior was plastered with cute plushies, Hello Kitty seat covers, and snacks everywhere...  
  
She could hardly imagine this serious, standoffish man transforming his car into something so cutesy.  
  
Noticing her stare, Jasper offered a brief explanation: ""Mia's into this stuff.""  
  
Freya got his meaning and stayed quiet for a long while before responding softly.  
  
""You finally got her back. I'm happy for you, Mr. Whitemore.""  
  
Jasper hadn't expected that response. His eyes darkened, and he said nothing more.  
  
Halfway to her place, Mia called, wanting to build a snowman with him. He pulled over, clearly eager to go to her, but hesitated when he glanced at Freya.  
  
Understanding his dilemma, Freya opened the door. ""I'll grab a Uber from here, Mr. Whitemore.""  
  
He nodded and got out to help with her stuff. Her hands slipped, and the box crashed to the ground. As he bent down, the streetlight illuminated its spilled contents, freezing him in place.  
  
Love letters addressed to him but never sent, candid photos she'd secretly taken, things he'd tossed that she'd rescued and treasured...  
  
Freya's heart hammered as she scrambled to gather everything.  
  
""Sorry about that.""  
  
Without a word, Jasper got back in his car and sped away.  
  
Freya waited in the snow for ages but couldn't get a ride. Trying to lug her box home, she was hit by an electric scooter.  
  
The collision left a nasty gash on her calf, blood staining the snow. Watching the hit-and-run driver disappear, she gasped with pain, lying in the snow for what felt like forever.  
  
When she could finally move, she limped through the snow for four hours before reaching her apartment.  
  
After patching up her wound, she checked her phone to find a message from Jasper, sent after he'd left:  
  
\[Stop being so obsessed with one guy. There are plenty of fish in the sea. Don't hang all your hopes on me.\]  
  
Freya stared at this message for a very long time.  
  
At dawn, she went downstairs, set fire to the box, and burned everything inside it. The love that had burned fiercely in her heart for eight years turned to ashes alongside those mementos.  
  
Jasper Whitemore, I'll grant your wish.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
After a quiet weekend, Monday morning rolled around, and Freya arrived at work on schedule.  
  
She handled her usual tasks, including notifying Jasper about his upcoming meeting. Approaching his office, she glanced through the partially open door and stopped cold.  
  
Mia was sitting in Jasper's lap, feeding him the other half of her cookie. The famously germaphobic CEO actually ate it with a smile, then gently kissed her fingertips.  
  
""You were talking about craving these yesterday, so I stood in line for three hours this morning. Worth it?"" His voice had a tenderness Freya had never heard before.  
  
""Mmm, they're perfect‚Äîsweet but not sickeningly so. You used to trek across town for these all the time. Now you're literally running a corporation. Can't you just send someone to get them?"" Mia wiggled her foot as he massaged her ankle.  
  
The look on Jasper's face was pure devotion. ""Anything that matters to you, I handle myself. Always.""  
  
Mia's face lit up as she wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him. He pulled her closer, completely lost in the moment.  
  
Watching them, Freya felt like she'd been punched in the chest, a bitter ache spreading through her. Her fingernails dug deep into her palms, leaving bloody crescents behind.  
  
As the meeting time approached, Freya composed herself and knocked lightly.  
  
""Mr. Whitemore, your meeting's about to start.""  
  
Hearing her, Jasper tensed slightly and started to rise, but Mia tugged him back down.  
  
""Don't go yet. Five more minutes?"" She gave him puppy-dog eyes.  
  
Her playful plea melted his resolve instantly.  
  
""Push the meeting back two hours,"" he called out.  
  
This meeting involved a collaboration between major New York corporations that was crucial to the company's future. Freya knew its importance and couldn't help adding:  
  
""The CEOs from Verdean, Aurex, and Vireon are already in the conference room...""  
  
""God, Jasper, your assistant is such a buzzkill! Can't she take a hint?"" Mia rolled her eyes dramatically.  
  
Jasper's expression hardened instantly. ""I said postpone it two hours. Nothing comes before Mia, got it?""  
  
Freya felt like she couldn't breathe. In the end, she simply closed the door and walked away.  
  
Everyone in their circle knew Jasper was a workaholic machine. No matter what was happening personally‚Äîeven right after surgery‚Äîhe'd drag himself in to finish his work.  
  
Yet here he was, risking relationships with major partners because of a little whining. This was completely new territory.  
  
Did he really love Mia that much?  
  
Freya pulled herself together and walked into the conference room to face the waiting executives.  
  
The Whitemore empire was powerful enough that these CEOs, despite being pissed, wouldn't directly criticize Jasper. Instead, they unloaded on Freya.  
  
She took their verbal abuse silently, head down.  
  
After an excruciating two-hour wait, Jasper finally showed up. As Freya left the conference room on legs that felt like jelly, Mia called out to her.  
  
""You're Freya, right? Jasper says you make killer coffee. Everyone looks dead on their feet‚Äîwhip up some for the whole floor? Mine with ice, no sugar.""  
  
Knowing her place in the hierarchy, Freya headed to the break room without protest.  
  
Two hours later, she finished preparing over four hundred cups, delivering them one by one.  
  
After just one sip, Mia's face darkened. She hurled her mug straight at Freya's head.  
  
The ceramic smashed against Freya's forehead, opening a nasty gash. She let out a gasp of pain and dropped to the floor, clutching her wound.  
  
Not satisfied, Mia grabbed more mugs and kept throwing them.  
  
Bruises bloomed across Freya's body as ceramic shards sliced her skin. Coffee soaked through her clothes, mixing with bright red blood dripping onto the floor.  
  
Despite the blinding pain, she could only curl into a ball, protecting her head and chest.  
  
The office went dead silent. Nobody dared step in as Mia continued her meltdown. They all kept their distance, watching in horror.  
  
The commotion brought Jasper out of his office. He surveyed the chaos and Freya's crumpled form with narrowed eyes.  
  
""What the hell happened?""  
  
Seeing him, Mia instantly switched to victim mode. ""Jasper, I asked her to make me coffee. I'm on my period, and she deliberately put ice in it. My cramps are killing me now.""  
  
Seeing her teary eyes, Jasper's face darkened immediately.  
  
""You've worked for me for four years and can't handle a simple coffee order? Or do you have some problem with Mia?""  
  
Freya raised her deathly pale face to explain, but he didn't give her the chance. He called over another assistant.  
  
""Dock her entire month's salary and quarterly bonus. Send a company-wide notice and have her make a public apology at next week's all-hands.""  
  
With that, Jasper draped his jacket over Mia's shoulders and led her away.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
As Jasper vanished down the corridor, the tears Freya had been fighting finally broke free.  
  
She forced herself up, wincing as she grabbed a broom and mop to tackle the mess of shattered ceramic and coffee.  
  
A few sympathetic coworkers came to help, their eyes full of pity.  
  
""I clearly heard her say 'with ice, no sugar.' How's she flipping this on you? Did you tick her off somehow?"" one whispered.  
  
""Like she needs a reason?"" another muttered. ""Everyone knows she's a total princess. Throws a fit over nothing. Half our circle can't stand her, but with Jasper in her pocket, nobody dares say boo.""  
  
""Man, I've never seen him this crazy about anyone. Freya, just watch your back. We're regular folks‚Äîwe can't compete with trust fund babies. With Jasper backing her play, we just have to eat whatever crap they serve us.""  
  
Freya appreciated their support, but their words left her emotionally tangled.  
  
Once, when a client tried blaming her for their own mistake on a contract, Jasper had stood rock-solid behind her. He'd believed in her completely, fighting until her name was cleared.  
  
But now? Mia drops one casual lie, and he doesn't even fact-check or let her explain. He just assumes she's at fault.  
  
After years of dedication, handling countless fires for him‚Äîdidn't she deserve that basic trust?  
  
Or in his world, did right and wrong not matter as long as Mia was happy?  
  
The thought left her heart feeling like raw hamburger.  
  
It took forever to clean everything before dragging her battered body home.  
  
She had barely stepped out of the shower when her phone lit up with Jasper's name.  
  
""Bring over some Advil and heating pads.""  
  
She threw everything together ASAP and headed to his penthouse.  
  
In just days, the once sleek space had transformed completely. The cherry tree his grandfather planted‚Äîgone, replaced by tulips. The black and white furniture he'd always preferred‚Äîswapped for pink and yellow pieces he used to mock. Display cases now showcased jewelry, designer bags, and gifts...  
  
Pure Mia, through and through.  
  
Freya took it all in silently before knocking on the bedroom door.  
  
Jasper opened it, grabbed the stuff, and finally glanced at her face.  
  
With the coffee cleaned off, her injuries looked brutal, making him pause.  
  
""Jesus. Have you had that checked out?""  
  
Freya just shook her head.  
  
He rubbed his temple, his tone softening slightly.  
  
""Look, Mia was just feeling like garbage. She wasn't gunning for you specifically, so don't take it personally. I'll add what I docked from your pay to your Christmas bonus. Get those wounds looked at‚Äîif they're bad, take a few sick days. I'll sign off on it, no red tape.""  
  
""That won't be necessary. At the end of this month‚Äî""  
  
Freya tried telling him about her resignation, but he cut her off, shoving a card into her hand.  
  
""Just do what I'm telling you. I need you to put together a welcome-back thing for Mia, so rest up and heal.""  
  
The words died in Freya's throat.  
  
She nodded, took the card, and turned to leave.  
  
As the door swung shut, she caught Mia's voice:  
  
""Babe, is that tea ready? Can you come rub my stomach?""  
  
""Coming right now. Just lie still and don't move, okay?""  
  
Hearing his tender tone, Freya smiled bitterly.  
  
Her own cramps were brutal too‚Äîshe'd actually passed out at work multiple times and been rushed to the ER.  
  
When he found out? Just a signed time-off form. No visits, no tea, no heating pads.  
  
Back then, she'd told herself he was swamped with work.  
  
Now she got it‚Äîhe just didn't give a damn.  
  
After leaving, Freya hit up urgent care for basic treatment.  
  
She crashed at home for a few days before getting bombarded with party specs from his assistant.  
  
Everything from floral arrangements to dessert selections to server uniforms came with ridiculous requirements.  
  
With just three days to pull it off, Freya pushed through her exhaustion to make it happen.  
  
After running herself ragged, the party kicked off at 7 PM sharp.  
  
Mia floated in wearing some couture masterpiece, immediately becoming the room's center of gravity.  
  
Guests swarmed her with compliments, feeding her ego.  
  
""It's been ages, but you're still that same knockout, Mia. Even a 'casual' welcome-back party looks like the Met Gala‚Äîclearly Jasper's still completely whipped!""  
  
""Remember college when some poor schmuck asked Mia out? Jasper literally got the guy transferred! He shredded love letters on sight, and when people talked smack about Mia, he put those dudes in the hospital!""  
  
""Everyone knows Mia's his kryptonite‚Äîthe one he can't resist! Look at that ice she's wearing‚Äîgotta be worth a couple million! And that dress is one-of-a-kind. Jasper's always been 'price is no object' when it comes to keeping Mia happy!""

1kjcbyk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kjcbyk,$KENDU- Writing crypto history!,"Memecoins used to be a fun and unique side of the crypto industry. Coins that barely or didn‚Äôt have any utility, coins that were created for or by a meme and rode their humorous aspect all the way to the stars. 

Unfortunately memecoins have turned into something dark. Coins created with one reason only, to make a quick buck over someone else‚Äôs back. 
From the obvious rug pulls to honeypot‚Äôs and every other scam in between. To the coins that aren‚Äôt direct scams but use techniques like market manipulation to lure new investors in, only to dump on them and take their money. On top of that stories of traders making millions lures new investors in.
Memecoins have turned into a sea of gambles, where it‚Äôs almost impossible to win. Most of the time you‚Äôre better off going to the casino. A far stretch from what they were once meant to be. They have always been a risk investment (obviously), just not one where you couldn‚Äôt win.

Fortunately every once in a while in that sea of gambles an actual project surfaces. One that isn‚Äôt build just to screw people over. One that has grown into a community which doesn‚Äôt sit on its ass and hopes for a pump, but a community that works harder and harder everyday to make sure the project succeeds. 
We‚Äôve seen before that coins with communities come out on top, even when people doubt them at first. Look at the giants, $Doge, $Shib or $Pepe for that matter.

$KENDU is taking it one step further, aside from being a coin with one of the chillest and most active communities around, $KENDU is establishing itself into a brand! Where creativity and hard work is not only appreciated, it‚Äôs encouraged.
What makes $KENDU different is its not only active on the socials, although we have a massive presence to be proud of! We are actively building IRL!
From Kendu energy drinks, Kendu coffee, Kendu beer. To sponsoring the Miami groves music festival! What this community has already achieved is nothing short of amazing!
All that is happening at a Mc of only $18m
Imagine the possibilities when we‚Äôre at way higher levels! It‚Äôs hard not to be excited about $KENDU!

I‚Äôm not here to beg you to pretty please buy our a bag of our coins. There are enough projects doing just that. 
We are different! I‚Äôm writing this to show you that you don‚Äôt have to gamble money away, to show you that there are still projects to believe in! 

Check out out subreddit, our website and especially our Telegram. Lurk around for a bit or a while, feel it out for yourself. Then decide if you want in! 
We‚Äôre excited to have you join the pack!
Although we encourage work we aren‚Äôt forcing anybody to do anything. You‚Äôre welcome to just chill if that‚Äôs what you like!

We don‚Äôt gamble, we work! $KENDU

My husband of nearly 30 yrs at the time had taken his last breath.

I had to watch him die...he is our of pain or whatever they fucking say but that isn't a comfort either. No, I wouldn't want him to be in pain just so I can say I have a husband. Also no I didn't want him to leave...he had to leave, though, but he left a year before I had found out I'm very ill...with an incurable disease. I would just have appreciated the support ... But looking back, and seeing how our relationship was back then and how it would have not gotten any easier (he was in pain) if he had stuck around somehow...I don't know if he would be the best person to call my support. My 26 yr old son holds that honor and title ... And I'm SO grateful for him. He pushed me to do stuff I really didn't want to do...and he's just there for me and his siblings still at home. 

I'm incredibly sad today, and even my coffee is bitter and unpalatable, no matter how I tried to fix it up. I am at the Mall, where I'm usually happy to be, but today I don't want to talk with anyone or interact with anyone. Also, I'm medicated to my eyeballs to keep me calm so I couldn't hold a conversation if I tried r n. I am very sedated and calm. (Good thing!) I can still function just fine also. I might grab a smoothie and chill. 

Can I get some support as I mourn my loss, 2 yrs ago today? I miss him so much. He was also my motivation to stay alive...until he turned abusive as dementia (I suspect bc his parents had it bad) took hold and his medical problem almost literally exploded on us (his intestines died, causing septic shock and death).

Thank you. As a widow ... I'm going thru this husbandless, but I'm not going thru this alone. That includes my health challenges.

Thanks all.

I'm going to cry now...in public...oh joy lol.ü´£ü´£ü´§",3,1746889337.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

1kjc85d,https://i.redd.it/ka36kv1uxyze1.png,"Understanding Today‚Äôs Economy What‚Äôs Driving Growth, Inflation, and Your Wallet","The economy touches every aspect of our lives‚Äîhow much we pay at the pump, the rents we negotiate, and even the price of our morning coffee. In the aftermath of pandemic-era stimulus and aggressive rate hikes, the U.S. economy now faces a period of ‚Äústeady as she goes.‚Äù Below, we break down the current picture, what it means for you in the near term, and what to watch in the months ahead.

**1. Where We Stand: Growth, Jobs, and Prices**

* **GDP Growth** Real U.S. GDP shrank **0.3 percent** in Q1 2025 (January‚ÄìMarch), the Bureau of Economic Analysis's first quarterly contraction since early 2022.
* **Employment** The unemployment rate was unchanged at **4.2 percent** in April 2025, continuing a narrow 4.0‚Äì4.2 percent band since May 2024 [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/empsit_05022025.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
* **Inflation** Consumer prices (CPI-U) rose **2.4 percent** over the 12 months ending March 2025‚Äîthe weakest annual increase since September 2021 [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

**2. What‚Äôs Driving Today‚Äôs Trends?**

1. **Supply-Chain Realignment** Firms are reshoring and diversifying suppliers to avoid future disruptions‚Äîeven if it means higher costs in the short run.
2. **Monetary Policy** The Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate hikes since 2022 have cooled demand, and with inflation near target, further increases now look unlikely unless prices spike above 3 percent.
3. **Fiscal Headwinds** Elevated federal debt from pandemic relief and infrastructure spending may limit new stimulus, reducing growth.

**3. How It Affects You Right Now**

* **Housing Costs** Mortgage rates near 7 percent have slowed home-buying, yet rents in many metros remain stubbornly high, squeezing household budgets.
* **Everyday Goods** Groceries and gas have eased slightly but stay above pre-pandemic levels. Strategies like bulk buying and discount apps can help stretch your dollars.
* **Savings & Investments** Higher yields on savings accounts and CDs offer opportunities for cash reserves, even as equity and bond markets remain sensitive to shifts in rate-cut expectations.

**4. Near-Term Outlook (Next 3‚Äì6 Months)**

* **Interest Rates** The Fed has signaled a pause through summer 2025. However, an unexpected rise in energy costs or wage pressures could prompt another hike.
* **Consumer Spending** After a strong spring travel season, spending may plateau without fresh fiscal support. Watch retail sales reports and consumer confidence surveys for early signs of a slowdown.
* **Labor Market** Job openings remain elevated, but hiring may cool if firms become more cautious. Wage growth will likely moderate toward 3‚Äì4 percent annually, easing payroll strains.

**5. Challenges on the Horizon**

* **Geopolitics & Trade** Tensions over technology exports and energy security could re-ignite supply-chain bottlenecks and increase prices.
* **Climate Shocks** Extreme weather‚Äîwildfires, floods, hurricanes‚Äîthreatens crops and infrastructure, with ripple effects on food costs and insurance premiums.
* **Workforce Transformation** Automation and AI rollouts will boost productivity but demand substantial upskilling and training investments.

Amelia  
  
It's already midnight, and my anniversary is officially over. I've been waiting for hours for my husband to come home. I've been calling his phone, but it's still off. I pace around the living room, wondering what I should do at this point. The best option would be to call his parents to let them know and ask for their help in finding him. But they'll probably think I'm making a mountain out of a molehill. They've never liked me. Despite not coming from a renowned family, they always wanted their son to marry a woman of a higher economic status, so to them, I'm not good enough.  
  
We got married twelve years ago, right after graduating high school. A slip-up with birth control led to the moment every woman dreams of. I married the man of my life when I was only eighteen years old. Nine months later, the second love of my life arrived, little Antonio. He was a little ball of flesh, pink and round. Everyone said I looked like a little girl playing with dolls.  
  
Two years later, Liliana arrived. The apple of my husband's eye. While Antonio was blond and his facial features were very similar to mine, Lili was a beautiful redhead, almost identical to her JuanLu. They both inherited their father's beautiful green eyes.  
  
Our life together was always harmonious. At nineteen, he became a responsible man who studied and worked to provide us with everything we needed. So I can say that we have been very happy.  
  
The sound of the phone snaps me out of my thoughts.  
  
""Hello?"" I answer with some concern.  
  
""Good evening, I'm calling because the owner of this phone was in an accident, and this is the last number he received a call from. Please, if you are a family member or acquaintance of this person, we would appreciate it if you could come to Lenox Hill Hospital as soon as possible.""  
  
I couldn't even utter a word. The phone slipped from my hands and fell to the floor. This can't be happening. Juan Luis has been in an accident. I immediately go upstairs to get my purse. The kids aren't home because, wanting to surprise my husband, I sent them to sleep at my mother's house. I grab my car keys and rush to the hospital. Twenty minutes later, I arrive at the reception desk. I don't know who to ask, so I inquire with the first person who crosses my path.  
  
""Good evening, miss, excuse me, who can give me information about a patient who was just admitted?"" The person kindly points me to the place where they provide patient information. I practically fly over there.  
  
""Sir, good evening, I received a call that Juan Luis Pe√±a was admitted a short while ago. Can you tell me where I need to go?"" The man types something into his computer. After long minutes, he looks up at me.  
  
""Indeed, Mr. Juan Luis Pe√±a arrived accompanied by his girlfriend. They were both in a car accident. They are still being evaluated, as the gentleman has not yet regained consciousness. You can go down that hallway to get more information.""  
  
Out of everything he said at the end, I couldn't hear anything else. He told me that Juan Luis and his girlfriend were in an accident. His girlfriend? What girlfriend?             
  
I quickly thank him and head towards the place he indicated. My heart starts to race. I think it knows that what I'm about to find is going to shatter it completely.  
  
""My love, wake up. Come on, honey. We were having such a good time.""   
  
Before entering the room, I hear those words. No, I don't think they're for my husband. He would never do this to me. However, when the door opens, I freeze at the scene before me.  
  
Juan Luis is lying on a bed, unconscious, as if he were just sleeping. A young, slim blonde woman clings to him, trying to wake him up.  
  
""My love, come on, don't be lazy, wake up. Look, your witch of a wife must be looking for you. And I don't want her to find you here. Come on, honey. Wake up, and I promise we'll keep making love like we were doing a while ago.""  
  
I can't listen anymore. I leave the room and lean against the wall outside, so as not to collapse. So that's why he wasn't answering me. That's why he wasn't coming home. Tears soon well up in my eyes. I rub them away forcefully, as if to see if what I just witnessed wasn't just a dream. Or rather, a nightmare.  
  
Two nurses approach, chatting among themselves, paying no attention to me.  
  
""They say the couple that just came in was being very affectionate, and that's why they crashed. Either they couldn't wait to get to where they were going to do their thing, or they were coming from somewhere and didn't have enough, hahaha.""  
  
Their words pierce my ears and my heart. I ask myself now what I should do. I decide to sit on one of the benches outside for family members. I'll wait for my husband to wake up. I don't want to interrupt him with his girlfriend inside.  
  
Two long hours pass, during which the pain in my heart continues to grow. The hope that it's all just a misunderstanding fades with each passing minute. Another half hour later, a doctor enters. The woman comes out of the room. She looks at me and smiles maliciously. She obviously knows who I am and is rubbing it in my face.  
  
I decide to go in and ask about Juan Luis's condition. I know he doesn't need me by his side, but knowing he's okay will allow me to leave. He doesn't need me by his side.  
  
""Good evening, doctor."" The doctor turns to look at me. My husband is now awake and gives me a strange look. He knows I'm going to find out about his secret.  
  
""Go ahead, and you are?"" I give him a fake smile and answer with a lie.  
  
""I'm Mr. Pe√±a's relative. They called me to let me know about the accident."" My husband's eyes widen in surprise.  
  
I don't think he was expecting my answer.  
  
""Alright, you can come in. Mr. Pe√±a is doing well; now that he's awake, we can see that there's no brain damage. Both he and his girlfriend are in good condition. I suggest they spend the night here, and I'll discharge them tomorrow."" He starts writing something on his notepad and excuses himself.  
  
When we're alone, my still-husband gives me a look that I can't quite decipher: anguish? pain? shame?            
  
""Amelia, I..."" he begins to say, when suddenly the blonde enters again.  
  
""Honey, they told me I'm fine. I'm going to stay here tonight, but I asked to sleep with you. That way we can leave together tomorrow.""  
  
The woman pretends not to see me, but she's very aware of my presence.  
  
""Katty, please. Go to your room. This is my wife.""   
  
The blonde turns to look at me, wincing slightly.  
  
""What is she doing here? Why did you call her? I'm your girlfriend now, and you're getting a divorce very soon. Tell her to leave, honey.""   
  
She approaches the bed where my husband is lying and takes his hand. My gaze falls on that spot. He doesn't pull away but on the contrary, he gives her hand a gentle squeeze.  
  
""Please, Katty, let me talk to her.""   
  
The girl lets go of him and walks towards the door. As she passes me, she gives me a slight shove. I can't react at this moment. I think I'm in shock because I can't even move.  
  
""Amy, I'm so sorry. This wasn't the way I wanted you to find out. I swear I never wanted to hurt you. It's just something I couldn't help. Forgive me.""   
  
Hearing that word, it feels like my body is starting to thaw after being frozen. Tears begin to flow uncontrollably.  
  
""You're sorry? Really?"" I angrily wipe away the tears that are still streaming down my face.  
  
""Forgive you? No, I can't. I'll never forget or forgive what you've done to me. If you didn't love me anymore, this wasn't the way. You should have ended our relationship first. That's not how you do things. I've known you for fifteen years. You know I would have understood. I know that sometimes love doesn't last forever. But you preferred to do everything behind my back. But if that's what made you happy, that's your problem. Don't ask me to understand when it never crossed my mind to ever cheat on you. Don't worry. Just as our life together began on a day like today, it ends on the same day. And don't worry, I'll never stand in the way of a divorce. You're young, and you deserve to be with the woman you choose. And if that's no longer me, I'll step aside.""  
  
At that moment, the door to the room opens to let in my mother-in-law. She's accompanied by the woman who helped destroy my home.  
  
""Son, my God! What happened to you?"" The woman completely ignores me and leans over her son.  
  
The girl goes with her and positions herself on the other side of the bed. I'm the only intruder here.  
  
Not wanting to be humiliated any further, I grab my purse and walk out. I walk out of that room and out of his life.  
  


# 2. We are going to divorce

2. We're Getting a Divorce  
  
Amelia  
  
How do you explain to two almost teenagers that their father has left home to start a new life with someone else, when your own heart hasn't even understood it yet?  
  
That night, when I got home, I started to destroy everything I had prepared for our celebration. I didn't care about getting rid of the ""valuable"" tableware that JuanLu's mother gave us a few years ago. That woman doesn't deserve my consideration. She never saw me as her son's wife, but she did accept his lover. Wow!  
  
Here, the only stupid one was me. Now I realize that those meetings he was coming home from very late lately were about her. Or when he had to leave suddenly without specifying where he was going. It was all because now he had someone else to please. I was so stupid and trusting. I never expected him to fall in love with someone else, when I always only had eyes for him and our children.  
  
I decide to call my mother to ask her not to bring the children over.  
  
""Mom?""  I try not to sound so affected, but I don't think I can help it. She's sure to notice and ask me, and I'm not ready to tell her yet. Not yet, and I don't know when I will be.  
  
""Hi, honey!  Did you have a good celebration? ... Although you sound sick.""  
  
If she knew how I felt, she wouldn't try to joke with me, but it's not her fault I'm unhappy.  
  
""No, Mom, I think I'm getting a cold. Please, let the kids stay at your house today. I'll pick them up tomorrow, or you can bring them later."" I need to cut this short. She's very intuitive and knows I'm hiding something.  
  
""Amelia Fuentes. Something's wrong and you don't want to tell me. Am I wrong?""  
  
As if her words were a switch being turned on, tears and sobs begin to flow uncontrollably. It didn't take much for my pain to appear this way.  
  
""Did you fight with JuanLu?""  
  
""Please, Mom, I'm not ready to talk about this. Don't ask me any more questions. When I'm ready to tell you, I will. But I can't now.""  
  
The sobs almost prevent me from speaking, leaving my voice choked. I know I'm scaring her, but I really can't say it out loud. My heart hurts so much that I think it will stop from so much suffering at any moment.  
  
""It's okay, honey, I won't pressure you. When you're ready, you know Mom will always be there for you.""  
  
I sit down, although I can't see myself. But if they see me like this, they'll worry, and my father will probably look for JuanLu to complain. I don't want any confrontation between them.  
  
After all, he's my father and Juanlu, the father of my children.  
  
""Thanks, Mom, and please, don't say anything about this to my father or the kids.""  
  
I don't say any more, so she'll hang up and let me continue to vent my pain. When the call ends, I throw myself on the bed and curl up in a fetal position. Today I will drain my pain. But tomorrow I must recover. I can't make my children suffer by seeing their mother like this, when they will be struggling with their own sorrows. I don't realize if it's day or night. I'm so tired of crying that I suddenly fall asleep.  
  
Amy, promise you'll always love me.   
  
Promise.  
  
Because if you stop loving me, I could die, and I don't think you want to be responsible for my death. I promise you'll always be the owner of my heart.  
  
Silly, you shouldn't make those promises. What if you meet someone else and fall in love? Will you be able to take responsibility for my heart dying?   
  
Never, Amy, I'll never stop loving you. I repeat, you'll always be the only owner of my heart, my soul, and my life. Only you, darling.  
  
I wake up, and I realize I'm still crying. How long will I be like this? No, I can't let myself be defeated. If he's already moved on to someone else, I can't stay stuck. I decide that I won't let his betrayal destroy me.  
  
Without strength, I get out of bed and head for the shower. I have to get dressed and go get my children. I'm not the only one who will suffer from this situation. I have to think about them. Although JuanLu will always be their father, they are used to his constant presence. I have to talk to them as soon as possible, or JuanLu's mother will get ahead of me. I know her. I know she must be very happy, but I won't give her the pleasure of seeing me defeated.  
  
When I finish showering, I put on comfortable clothes and head to my parents' house. They will be very sad because, unlike my now almost ex-husband's parents, mine love JuanLu very much. He made them believe that I would always be happy and well by his side. But it was just cheap talk.  
  
I take the car keys and go to pick up my children. When I arrive, I park but don't get out immediately. I still have to think about how to say things so they won't be as traumatic for everyone as they were for me. I take a deep breath to work up my courage and then get out of the car. I open the house with my own key, and I can see that everyone is in the dining room, having lunch.  
  
""Mommy, Mommy!""  
  
My children run towards me. They hug me, and the warmth I feel comforts me a little.  
  
""Hello, my loves. Keep eating your breakfast.""  
  
After giving me a kiss, they go back to the table. My father doesn't say anything, but my mother can't keep quiet, so she calls me by my name without caring about anything.  
  
""Amelia, come with me to the living room.""  
  
I get up and follow my mother. It's not easy what I have to tell her, so I take a breath before speaking, before she starts asking questions.  
  
""Mom... Yesterday I found out that Juan Luis is cheating on me. He has another woman, and his mother knew. They had a car accident, and they called me from the hospital because he was unconscious. He didn't bother to deny it. We're getting a divorce, and as you can understand, this is killing me. And I have to tell the kids, and I don't know how.""  
  
I say the last sentence almost unable to speak. The tears come back to my eyes. The pain contorts my face into a grimace. My mother takes me in her arms as she did when I was little. She strokes my hair, and I can vent my sadness.  
  
""Are you sure your marriage can't be fixed?"" she asks me while I'm still in her arms.  
  
I shake my head, so she just sighs deeply.  
  
""I really thought what you two had was forever. When he talked to us when you got pregnant, he promised us he would always love you, that's why we agreed to you getting married so young. But apparently, his 'forever' had an expiration date. But you must not let yourself be defeated. Cry all you have to cry and then, stop. Your children don't deserve to see their mother broken and their father happy with another woman. In the future, you will be Lily's example.""  
  
My mother is right. I have to recover as soon as possible. I don't want my children to suffer because of their father. She hands me a napkin, and I wipe my eyes.  
  
We go out to join my family at the table, although I only drink coffee. I'm not in the mood to eat. I wait for the kids to finish and let their food settle. After noon, I decide it's time to talk to them.  
  
""Mom, do you have a cold? Your eyes are red.""  
  
My little Antonio. He's so kind and handsome. I'm sure when he grows up, he'll break many hearts. It's in my hands to make him a good man, to respect the girl who will be his partner. Meanwhile, my Lily is quiet. She's very perceptive; she probably already knows that something serious is going on in our family.  
  
""No, son, I don't have a cold. The truth is, something happened. Something very important.""  
  
I wait a second to catch my breath.  
  
""Your father and I are getting a divorce.""  
  
I see their faces turn pale with the impact.  
  
""Mom, are you kidding?"" My daughter, who adores her father, jumps up as if propelled by a spring.  
  
""Does my face look like I'm kidding?"" She shakes her head, visibly affected.  
  
""You're old enough so I'm not going to hide anything from you. Your father met someone else. He's decided to give that woman a chance, and I'm not going to interfere with his happiness. We've been married for twelve years, but that doesn't mean what we have is forever. At least that was the idea at first, but apparently, fate has other plans for us. Please, I ask you to understand. He'll never stop being your father; he'll just stop being my husband. Once everything is official, we'll see how the arrangements for you two will work. For now, he won't be living with us anymore. Do you understand?"" The traitorous tears return to my eyes.  
  
I know it hurts them as much as it hurts me, and it will mean a change in their lives, but at some point, they'll get over it.  
  
We'll get over it.",1,1746889012.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

1kjc4a7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI__Stories/comments/1kjc4a7/catfish_morning/,Catfish Morning,"# Catfish Morning

Joe woke up just before the sunrise, his internal clock steady as ever. There was no alarm, no phone, no modern noise to rattle him awake‚Äîjust the subtle shift in the air, the slow lightening of the sky beyond the canvas of his old green tent. He rubbed the sleep from his eyes, stretched until his back cracked in satisfying protest, and crawled out into the dew-soaked world.

It was too early to fish, but that didn‚Äôt matter. Timing was part of it, and Joe had been living this way for long enough to know the rhythm of the lake like he knew the lines on his palms. Besides, by the time he got his flat-bottom boat ready‚Äîthe one he had built with his own calloused hands‚Äîthe sun would have burned off the last of the morning mist.

He started a fire just big enough to heat a tin of water for coffee, the flames licking around a battered percolator he'd had for twenty years. It let out a happy sputter as it brewed, and Joe took down his tent methodically, folding and packing with practiced efficiency. Everything had its place. His boat, which he called *The Wren*, was a little thing‚Äîjust enough for him, a cooler, and a pole or two‚Äîbut it was sound, and it had taken him across hundreds of quiet mornings like this.

The fire hissed as he stamped it out, and he pushed the boat out beyond the scraping line, his bare feet numb against the cold, pebbled mud. He wore old jeans‚Äîfaded and frayed at the bottom‚Äîand no shirt. No shoes either. Shoes were just a liability out here. They got wet, and he‚Äôd be wet anyway. The water was part of him now.

With a grunt, Joe swung himself into the boat, the slight motion causing the mist on the water to ripple. As he settled in, the sun finally crested the trees, spilling gold onto the lake. The mist shimmered like some ethereal curtain being drawn back. The lake responded with stillness, an ancient silence broken only by the creak of *The Wren* and the occasional bird waking up to sing.

It was going to be a catfish morning. The top feeders wouldn‚Äôt show for a while‚Äînot until the sun got higher and the water warmed and stirred. Catfish, though, were different. They were already awake, slow and deep and ancient as the silt at the bottom. Joe knew where to find them‚Äîthree holes, spaced across the southern side of the lake, where the big ones lived and rarely moved.

Joe cast his first line into the water just as the coffee hit his blood. He exhaled through his nose, slow and deliberate, as the float gently tapped the surface once, then settled.

He didn‚Äôt speak. There was no one to speak to. But that was fine. He liked it that way. Silence was a companion now, not a void.

He‚Äôd once had a very different life. A wife, a house with gutters that always needed cleaning, two cars in the driveway, and a job that kept his phone buzzing at all hours. All that had collapsed in slow motion over a decade‚Äîfirst the layoff, then the foreclosure, and finally the realization that he had built his life like a man stacks cards in the wind.

He had come out here just to think. That was five years ago. He hadn‚Äôt left.

Joe checked his line. A small tug. Something curious but not committed. He let it be. Patience was everything. The lake rewarded those who didn‚Äôt rush it. He checked the sky. The sun had risen high enough now to scatter the mist. The water lost some of its glassy sheen, and a gentle breeze stirred the surface.

The catfish struck the second hole just after 8:00 a.m.

Joe's arm jerked in instinct, and he braced his feet. This one was strong. Not fast like a bass or jittery like perch. Just steady, stubborn weight‚Äîlike reeling in a tire that didn't want to be caught. He smiled through his teeth. This was why he came.

Minutes passed in slow battle. The fish stayed deep, scraping the bottom and pulling sideways, but Joe knew how to angle it, how to wait. Eventually, the fish broke the surface with a slap, its whiskers twitching in protest.

Joe pulled it in, laying it gently on the board at the center of the boat. ""Not bad,"" he muttered. It was a big one. Fat. Maybe twelve pounds. But not old yet. Not the kind that gets that blue-gray hue of age, the one that tells you the fish is more legend than dinner.

He looked into the fish‚Äôs eye. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not ready,‚Äù he said, and unhooked it gently, slipping it back into the water.

The catfish didn‚Äôt thrash. It slid back into the depths like a shadow returning home.

By noon, Joe had caught and released five more. None were quite right. He wasn‚Äôt looking for the biggest. Just the one he felt was meant for tonight.

And then he found it‚Äîor rather, it found him.

The bite came fast, almost casual. Joe pulled, expecting a small one, and then the resistance hit. Not weight, not drag‚Äîjust pressure. Heavy, immovable pressure. He braced again, adjusting his position. This one wasn‚Äôt just big. It was clever.

The fight lasted fifteen minutes. Joe‚Äôs arms ached, and sweat trickled down his spine. But when it surfaced, he knew. It wasn‚Äôt the largest, but it had eyes like still water‚Äîcalm, resolved. There was a dignity to this fish. It had lived long enough. It had fed generations of smaller fish. And now it would feed him.

He whispered a thank you and placed it in his cooler with care.

Back on shore, the sun beginning to sink low again, Joe cleaned the fish with practiced reverence. His hands moved automatically‚Äîslice, scrape, rinse. He built another fire, a bit larger this time, and laid out the catfish with seasoning he carried in a tin.

As it cooked, the air filled with the rich, earthy aroma of the lake and fire and meat.

Joe leaned back against a log and watched the horizon.

He didn‚Äôt think about the past much anymore. Life was simpler now, not easier, but clearer. He owned nothing but what he carried. He needed nothing but what he caught. There were no clocks, no bills, no traffic. Just wind, water, and quiet purpose.

He ate in silence, pulling each bite apart with his fingers. The fish was perfect‚Äîfirm, sweet, cooked just enough. He thought about saving some for later, but finished it all. There wouldn‚Äôt be another like that soon. That was part of the deal.

When the stars blinked into view, Joe rolled out his sleeping bag on the shore instead of setting up the tent again. The night was cool and clean, the frogs singing from the far bank. He stared at the sky until the constellations swam.

And then, in that final moment before sleep, he smiled. Tomorrow would be another catfish morning.

And he‚Äôd be ready.",1,1746888794.0,AI__Stories,0,1.0,False

**Summary: The Pit of meaninglessRubbish**

""meaninglessRubbish"" (John, mid-20s) is trapped in a vortex of **crippling social anxiety, relentless unemployment, and suffocating parental control,** all obsessively documented on his bleak YouTube channel. His life is a monotonous, financially barren grind, punctuated by disastrous forays into self-improvement and tortured interactions with the online world.

His entanglement with fellow YouTuber ""Hidinginmyroom"" (HIMR/Daniel) is a **festering wound.** What began as a naive belief in shared misery devolved into a cringeworthy IRL ""meet-up"" in Japan where MR felt dismissed and humiliated. This was followed by perceived public mockery from HIMR, cementing MR's view of HIMR as a hypocritical drama-monger. The fallout includes MR's own small YouTube channel being **haunted by HIMR's drama-obsessed fanbase,** derailing his attempts to share his own ""meaningless rubbish."" Even another YouTuber meet-up (with ""ZimZam"") became another expensive HIMR-centric disappointment. This whole ""HIMR Parasite"" saga is a brutal lesson in online toxicity and MR's inability to escape being a footnote in others' dramas.

Professionally, MR is **castrated.** Fired from an office job for looking at ""3D printed guns"" (a game reference), an event leading to stress-induced hair loss and a police visit, he's since faced years of rejection. Course after course (data analysis, marketing) yields **zero employment.** His parents **actively sabotage job opportunities** they deem ""unsuitable"" (like a Sainsbury's cleaning job), trapping him in a cycle of dependence.

Socially, beyond the HIMR disaster, he's **terrified of women.** His expensive, self-funded trips to Japan are brutal self-flagellation exercises to approach them, usually ending in anxiety attacks (shaking legs, nausea) or being stood up. At home, he's a **prisoner in his parents' dilapidated house** (shower broken over a year, faulty internet constantly disrupting his streams), where they control his disability money and infantilize him. He can't afford to move out. His YouTube channel is a public diary of this despair, most viewers clicking off in under a minute. He is ""fed up and defeated,"" acutely aware of his ""meaningless rubbish"" existence, with no viable escape in sight.

**MR's Financial Black Hole: Concise & Brutal Tally of Wasted Cash**

""meaninglessRubbish"" (John) has systematically **incinerated thousands of pounds Sterling (GBP)** ‚Äì scraped from his meagre ¬£300-¬£390/month UK Universal Credit ‚Äì on disastrous Japan trips and other pointless expenditures, deepening his financial oblivion and despair.

**I. THE JAPANESE MONEY PIT (Primary Financial Drain):**
*   **A. ""SELF-IMPROVEMENT"" TRIPS (At least 4 Solo Osaka Ventures):**
    *   **Individual Trip Cost:** ~**¬£1,200 GBP** (Flights ~¬£900; Grim Airbnb ~¬£300).
    *   **Subtotal (4 trips):** ~**¬£4,800 GBP.**
    *   **Outcome:** Amplified social terror, profound failure.
    *   **Specific Waste within Trip:** Additional **~¬£150 GBP** for a bullet train to Tokyo to meet ""ZimZam"" (YouTuber), deemed a pointless, HIMR-obsessed ""waste of money.""
*   **B. THE CATASTROPHIC MISSED FLIGHT:**
    *   **Cost:** **¬£1,500 - ¬£2,000 GBP** (funded by selling personal stocks) after his brother was a no-show for a pre-flight meet-up.
    *   **Outcome:** Pure financial devastation.

**TOTAL ESTIMATED BRUTAL FINANCIAL WASTE ON JAPAN ALONE (GBP):**
**¬£6,300 - ¬£6,800 GBP.**

---

**II. OTHER RETARDED FINANCIAL SPENDS & LOSSES (Often Fuelled by Boredom/Despair, Especially in Japan):**

*   **A. LITANY OF DISAPPOINTING JAPANESE CONVENIENCE STORE FOOD/DRINK:**
    *   **Consistent Pattern:** Numerous small purchases of ""weird,"" ""artificial,"" ""bland,"" or ""horrible"" items.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   ""Weird watery coffee,"" ""artificial"" apple juice.
        *   **Plum-flavored seaweed sticks** (binned ‚Äì ""really salty"").
        *   ""Deep fried brown sugar snacks"" (weird, burnt tasting).
        *   The infamous **""Japanese slop"" cup noodle** (generic, salty, disappointing, despite being a pricier ""top shelf"" option, contained a ""mystery meat cube"").
        *   ""Weird sweet potato thing"" (not filling, sweetness ruins it).
        *   ""Chicken and leek skewer"" (leek ruins chicken).
        *   **""Red bean drink""** (bitter then sweet, with weird bean bits, binned).
        *   **""Cheese cup noodle""** (artificial cheese, ""tasted weird"").
        *   The utterly revolting **PICKLED EGGS** (insanely vinegary, horrible, jar hard to open, spilled juice everywhere).
    *   **Impact:** Adds up to significant waste on unsatisfying crap.

*   **B. SYMBOLIC HIMR BEER INCIDENT:**
    *   **Cost:** Price of one beer.
    *   **Action:** Bought beer to give to Hidinginmyroom (HIMR). After perceived humiliation, **POURED BEER DOWN THE SINK** in frustration.
    *   **Impact:** Small financial waste, potent symbol of dashed hopes.

*   **C. TECH CASUALTIES (Indirect Financial Loss from Japan):**
    *   **Damage:** Laptop battery **FRIED** by faulty electrics in cheap Japanese Airbnb.
    *   **Impact:** Cripples a key hobby/escape; necessitates future expensive replacement.

1kjbyod,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kjbyod/does_the_breville_grind_control_coffee_maker/,Does the Breville Grind Control Coffee Maker Deliver the Ultimate Brewing Experience Review?,"**Stylish and Functional Design**  
The Breville BDC650BSSUSC Grind Control Coffee Maker immediately caught my attention with its sleek, brushed stainless steel design. It‚Äôs modern but not flashy, and it fits perfectly with the other stainless steel appliances in my kitchen. At 16.3 inches tall, it‚Äôs not overly bulky, so it fits nicely under my cabinets. The LCD display is easy to read, displaying essential information like grind settings, brew time, and the number of cups selected. It genuinely feels like a premium product when you interact with it, from the buttons to the well-crafted carafe.  

**Steep and Release Technology**  
This machine isn‚Äôt just about aesthetics‚Äîit‚Äôs built with innovative features like the Steep and Release Technology. I‚Äôve tried brewing directly into the thermal carafe, a travel mug, and even a regular tall cup, and each time, the flavor profiles remained consistent and balanced. I could almost taste the essential oils being extracted from the beans, offering vibrant flavors I don‚Äôt usually get with other drip machines.  

[Don‚Äôt miss Breville BDC650BSSUSC deals‚Äîcheck Amazon here.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b00vggvqci/)  

**Integrated Adjustable Grinder**  
One thing that sets this coffee maker apart is the built-in grinder. I can easily adjust the grind size to match the type of beans I‚Äôm using, whether it‚Äôs a darker roast from South America or a lighter, floral Ethiopian coffee. There are eight strength settings to choose from, which is perfect depending on whether I‚Äôm brewing for myself or guests who prefer something milder. Being able to choose pre-ground coffee as well is a nice touch for days when I just want to toss in beans quickly and go.  

**Programmable Auto Start**  
The programmable auto-start feature has been life-saving on busy mornings. I usually set the machine to start brewing about 10 minutes before my alarm goes off, so I wake up to the wonderful aroma of freshly brewed coffee. It maintains a consistent temperature throughout the brewing process, which is crucial for the perfect cup of coffee.  

**Positives**  
- Adjustable grind options to match bean type and personal preferences  
- Thermal carafe keeps coffee hot for hours without the burnt taste  
- Programmable auto-start for convenience during hectic mornings  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- The brewing process can be noisier than some competitors  
- Cleaning the grinder requires extra effort due to coffee residue  
- Bulky design might not suit smaller kitchens  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other coffee makers like the Cuisinart DGB-900BC Grind-and-Brew or the DeLonghi Dinamica, the Breville stands out in terms of grind customization and brew versatility. While the Cuisinart offers a slightly lower noise level, it lacks the Steep and Release Technology that makes brewing directly into different vessels so effective. The DeLonghi has a sleeker automatic milk frothing option, but that feature is unnecessary for drip coffee lovers like me. On the downside, the Breville does feel heavier and less compact compared to its peers.  

**Budget-Friendly**  
In terms of its value proposition, this coffee maker is a strong contender. Its ability to combine a quality grinder, customizable settings, and a well-insulated thermal carafe mean you‚Äôre getting multiple products rolled into one. While admittedly priced on the higher side, its features make it worth every penny depending on your brewing needs. [Curious about Breville BDC650BSSUSC cost?

1kjbxy1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1kjbxy1/some_questions_as_a_potential_tourist/,Some Questions As A Potential Tourist,"Shalom my beautiful fellow Jews, and to everyone from Israel. I hope you are keeping safe and well.

We came to Israel in March 2022 for our honeymoon and had an amazing time, and we are thinking of coming back again, potentially around the mid to end April 2026 time (last time we came was during Purim and we loved it so this time we want the Yom HaAtzmaut experience to get our full Zionist excitement out). If you don't mind, I have a few questions which I would appreciate being answered, if possible. To note, I am a British Jew, and I do not understand Hebrew writing and would very much appreciate any responses to be in English, if possible? I might have a lot of questions, but even answering one would be much appreciated.

1. Do all buildings have shelters? If there is a situation like rockets being sent over, what is the protocol for this? I'm disabled (no mobility devices but a slow walker with lots of health conditions) so would I have to run long distances? Do sirens last so long that toilet usage may be an issue?

2. We would have to rent a car like we did last time, again due to my disabilities and a need to go places from door to door. We noticed parking was quite expensive and difficult to find on-street parking. Is this the same situation and does anyone have any tips on how to secure parking, regardless of cost?

3. Most travel insurance companies are not covering Israel right now, due to the war. Does anyone know of any companies which cover insurance in Israel, specifically healthcare insurance?

4. We are thinking of staying in Tel Aviv again, using Tel Aviv as our base, but doing a couple of nights in Eilat as my husband enjoys diving (I would either relax or go shopping whilst he dives). We are also thinking of doing a few drive trips to Jerusalem. Can anyone recommend which hospitals in Tel Aviv, Eilat and Jerusalem tend to have good quality of care, in case I end up in the ER? (I have a medical condition whereby flare ups lead to hospitalisation). If I have the names of some hospitals, I can plan accommodation quite nearby.

5. We want to visit where Nova happened on 7th October 2023 to pay our respects. Does anyone know what address we would input into our GPS? 

6. Some of the routes driving southbound are quite close to Gaza and are on the Gaza Envelope, Ashdod and Ashkelon. Are these areas safe to drive through and just sound scary, or would you recommend avoiding outright? If so, which other alternative routes could be taken to avoid the 4 highway?

7. I have an overwhelming appreciation of the IDF and feel like I want to thank IDF heroes who I see walking about, and possibly if I see visiting places for food or coffee maybe paying their bill out of appreciation. How would this be viewed? Would they feel offended, or be welcome to the gesture?

8. I'm absolutely praying all remaining hostages come home urgently and are back in Israeli soil. However, if unbearably any hostages may still be remaining in Gaza... how can I, a Jewish tourist in Israel, support the ""Bring Them Home Now"" campaign whilst in Israel? How do people usually show solidarity, especially when it is possible to come across loved ones? 

9. When we last visited, Waze automatically changed to Hebrew writing and we had to use Google Maps instead as we cannot read Hebrew. Is there a setting in Waze to keep writing in English (such as ""Ben Yehudah Street"" for example)?

10. Finally, how do Israelis generally celebrate Yom HaAtzmaut inside Israel? Is it possible to celebrate in both Jerusalem and Tel Aviv on the same day?


Thank you in advance for taking time to read my post, and for anyone able to kindly answer any of my questions.

1kjbxjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1kjbxjw/a_list_of_incredible_projects_in_ethereum/,A list of incredible projects in Ethereum,"Here's a list of incredible projects in Ethereum:

There's **ZKP2P**, which runs on the Base execution protocol. It allows any web event to be used as an input in a self-executing smart contract. That means a payment on Web2 or a centralized payment system like Venmo or Revolut can be used ‚Äî trustlessly ‚Äî to execute a token swap on Ethereum. It's permissionless, it's trust-minimized, and it works by proving fiat payments without exposing any private data. In other words, this becomes an on-ramp that doesn‚Äôt require a centralized peer-to-peer fiat-to-crypto platform. It just uses Ethereum.

The next project I‚Äôm very interested in is **Aztec Network**. This is a rollup-based execution protocol that settles to Ethereum and is built from the ground up to allow privacy. Privacy is the biggest missing element right now in the blockchain space, and Aztec has completely committed itself to making it a normal part of blockchain-based finance. It lets developers build smart contracts where inputs and outputs are encrypted by default, using a system they‚Äôve built around their custom AVM and the Noir language. It‚Äôs aiming to make privacy programmable, not just bolt it on.

Next up is **Tornado Cash**. Tornado Cash is the most widely adopted privacy protocol in the world. It‚Äôs also suffered the most intense state-level attack any protocol has ever faced. The U.S. government actually sanctioned it, adding immutable smart contract addresses to its SDN list. Those sanctions were later struck down in federal court after a long legal fight. Developers were criminally charged under the previous administration, and those charges may now be on the way out under the new Republican administration. But regardless of how the cases unfold, the sheer intensity of the attack shows the potential that Tornado Cash has to disrupt global finance. Ethereum already lets people transact peer-to-peer by default. But when you add privacy, those peer-to-peer payments become usable in any context. You can pay your contractor, your barber, your rent, or your coffee ‚Äî without exposing sensitive financial history to your counterparty.

The next one I'm very interested in is **MegaETH**. MegaETH is a totally modular project ‚Äî really a full execution environment ‚Äî that uses EigenLayer and EigenDA for its data availability. Validation and consensus are handled by Ethereum, and execution is done on its own high-throughput EVM. By taking the best from every part of the modular stack, it achieves the greatest scalability of any blockchain in history, all while staying fully Ethereum-aligned. Even its off-chain data availability is cryptoeconomically secured via restaked Ether. EigenLayer shows that Ethereum‚Äôs modular scaling roadmap isn‚Äôt just feasible ‚Äî it allows for a system that will eventually exceed the scalability of centralized Web2 apps. And it proves that restaked ETH can act as economic glue, aligning off-chain systems with Ethereum‚Äôs trust model.

The next project I‚Äôm very excited about is the **ZKVM** being created by RISC Zero using RISC-V. They‚Äôre building a system that can prove an entire Ethereum block with a zero-knowledge proof. That means even very lightweight devices will be able to validate full Ethereum blocks without running a full node. That opens the door to Ethereum eventually scaling to 10,000 transactions per second, without compromising hardware accessibility or end-user verifiability.

Then there‚Äôs **Base**. Base is right now the leading Ethereum execution protocol. It rolls up on Ethereum using the Optimism stack. It has no token, so it‚Äôs fully ETH-aligned, and it‚Äôs backed by Coinbase ‚Äî arguably the most important company in crypto. BASE is proving that the Ethereum scaling roadmap is the best in the world, and it‚Äôs bringing Ethereum‚Äôs magic to the entire world. Coinbase‚Äôs laser focus on UX is essential, especially now that scalability bottlenecks have been largely solved with the maturation of the rollup construct.

And finally, **BlackRock‚Äôs BUIDL fund**. This one might be the most institutionally important. BlackRock launched a tokenized fund ‚Äî on Ethereum. It holds U.S. Treasuries, distributes yield daily, and it already surpassed $1.5 billion in assets. It‚Äôs the first time the world‚Äôs largest asset manager issued a fund directly on a public blockchain. That‚Äôs not just adoption ‚Äî it‚Äôs anchoring traditional finance to Ethereum. And it signals that the Ethereum settlement layer is credible enough for institutions managing trillions. It‚Äôs hard to overstate how big that is.

There are many more Ethereum projects that I am very excited about, but these are the first few that come to mind.

*Tylen*

In the daylight, this place in the city held new marvels, and Tylen could barely keep from running into Torp or tripping over his own feet. The brick and stone that was so widespread still amazed him, though now, being further from the main square, he did see many places that used wood. Even then, it was often fortified by stalwart stone settings, or mixed in with brick.

The music carried louder now, enough to sound like a pleasant melody just out of hearing, rather than the nightly whispers of ghosts. He was awed by the sheer height of things. They had come out of some inn; jam-packed next to several other buildings, it rose four entire stories above him once he was on the street, and it was not even the tallest in sight. He felt like they would tumble down at any moment.

Color and smell assaulted him like circus performers. Spices he had rarely sniffed, except for when his mother or Hal had brought them seemed commonplace. Shops with specific and purposeful colors appeared to correlate somewhat to their wares; a golden-yellow shop emitted the sweet, doughy smell of yeast, while a more reddish and brown shop smelled of earth, chocolates, and coffee.

In the street, and in such a number he bumped into many, were throngs of people more varied than he had known possible. Men in armor, women in colorful clothing or‚Ä¶little clothing. His cheeks colored and he looked away. There was so much.

After twisting their way through the busy thoroughfare, they entered the main square. It was far earlier than it had been when Tylen arrived the day before, and the line to the war was long indeed.

He saw Torp shaking his head and raised his eyebrows.

‚ÄúYoung boys,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúYounger than you, for many of them. They are rash.‚Äù

He considered the line, seeing several that seemed exactly his age. ‚ÄúI am not?‚Äù

Torp gave him a hard, searching look. ‚ÄúYou could not be convinced otherwise. Many of them could, with the right‚Ä¶words.‚Äù

For a moment, he worried Torp had gleaned some aspect of what he had used to channel the Weave, but he was already hurrying on. Tylen went after him, and re-examined the line.

Maybe Torp was right. He couldn‚Äôt place his finger on it, but for some of them, especially the younger ones, there was a look in their gaze. A certain flick to the eyes, a posture in the shoulders. They were there, but thinking of things elsewhere. In that way they were like him, but remembering how he had stood there, he knew what he had thought of. Or rather, hadn‚Äôt. That was it, perhaps. They stood in line and thought of what was to come next, while he had stood in line and tried not to think of why it was the only place left for him.

Passing the square, a building dominant like a mountain loomed vast into the sky. Three pillars of enormous size rose like daggers from the ground, and in slanted fashion met the great awning stone roof. High, high in the air under that roof birds flew in a second sky, and perhaps wondered where the sun had gone. Beneath it, sprawling and luminescent, Runes.

They grooved the earth in marble channels of impossible craftsmanship, and from them glowed a rainbow of color. Trees and flowers and people went around them, and it was like the glow infused them.

‚ÄúWell?‚Äù

Tylen started, realizing he had stood still in awe while Torp went on. He hurried forward again, and they came to the side of one of the Runes. Then he noticed a curious thing.

‚ÄúWhy are there more than four?‚Äù

‚ÄúSharp, kid. Not all of them are known. You know your myth?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy‚Ä¶‚Äù He swallowed. ‚ÄúMy mother told me many. She said that Runewriting was lost in the Black Isle.‚Äù

Torp eyed him a curiously long time after that. ‚ÄúHm. Yes, well, that is partly true and will suffice for now. In any case, only the largest four here can be Traced. The others, if painstakingly carved onto things, may have other effects when infused, but--‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs what your wooden blocks were.‚Äù

He grinned. ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs what I wanted them to be, anyways. Now. To this first one, place your hand on it.‚Äù

Tylen knelt, and realized his pack was not with him. Panicked, he clutched his pant-leg, and with relief found that both the crest and yarn were there. He did love the sword, but he was content to chance being away from the sword. He placed his hand on the carved sigil.

A rush of prickling on the inside of his head staggered him, and he fell back onto the ground. It was like he had briefly stared at the sun; an imprint of the Rune floated in the middle of his vision before fading away.

Then he heard a sudden chorus of voices. He glanced around. Most people nearby, who seemed to have been there largely for the scenery and peace, looked at him expectantly.

‚ÄúTorp‚Ä¶what do they‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúTrace it. Call the Weave, and let it fill the shape.‚Äù

Oh. And everyone knew he had just learned it.

Reaching for the Weave, he found again that while a bit easier, with all the people around him he could not easily summon it. When some began to look away, the prick of shame pushed him over the edge, and he pulled at the hand of the shadow.

He went Down.

The rage of Weave flooded his senses. It burst from his skin and he glowed momentarily, a brief flash of green. Then he fought back the blackness that crept around his vision, and is settled into a grey. Letting the Rune‚Äôs image fill his mind, he pushed the Weave into it. Slowly, but surely, a wispy grey and silver Rune appeared in front of him.

A small smattering of applause met the Rune‚Äôs appearance, and feeling self-conscious, he let his concentration lapse and released the Weave back to Aath. In doing so, the Rune faded, and he felt a tremendous surge of magic flood him. This Weave took much less effort to direct, and he understood now why Torp had been able to make the stone heat up so fast.

Where was Torp? Looking around, he realized he could not see him. Before he had a chance to cry out or move, a hand shot out of his peripheral, offering to help him up.

‚ÄúHello young man.‚Äù The gritty voice said it like an order. ‚ÄúJoining the Warcrest?‚Äù

I wholeheartedly believe that the human brain struggles to process things past a certain point. Where, as a defense mechanism of sorts, it numbs itself to the severity of the events it bore witness to. I've even considered if I¬†*can*¬†speak about what happened. Truthfully, I don't think I carry enough evidence for it to matter in the end whether I publicize it or not. After all, I'm not supposed to be alive.

\-

I distinctly remember feeling nauseous as we flew from the small Canadian port out to the remote cabin on the lake that my father had rented for the nearly ten day trip. The sea plane was rocked by turbulence and the spotty flying of our pilot, Hugo, who was entrenched in conversation with my dad. The two men sharing a childlike wonder for the 'great outdoors' as men their age tend to do. I couldn't say I was bound for the same path, unfortunately. I had diverted from the family tradition, instead opting for the path of a starving artist. My dad had tried early on to sway me toward what he enjoyed, enlisting me into the cub scouts, and subsequently the boy scouts, but gave up around when I had turned twelve as my enthusiasm couldn't have been more absent. I knew he wasn't upset necessarily, just a bit sad that I couldn't bond with him on the same level.

The eventual landing that followed on the lake couldn't rip my dad and Hugo apart as they exchanged further stories and anecdotes. Unloading our gear from the aircraft was seemingly second to the conversation.

Eventually, the two exchanged pleasantries before Hugo clambered aboard his vessel and departed, leaving us on the dock of the isolated Yukon cabin.

""Hey, kiddo, mind helping me move these boxes over to the side? I wanna make sure that it's all separated for when Emmett gets here."" My dad gestured to a few large, plastic wrapped cardboard boxes mixed in with our own supplies.

""Who?"" I asked, thumping my way over as my boots knocked their way across the old wooden dock.

My dad taped his forehead with his fingers playfully.

""Mr. Clifton! My bad. Still refer to him by Mr. Clifton, okay?"" he said, lifting a larger box above his gut and carrying it over to its designated spot.

Mr. Clifton, as I'd been informed, was the man who actually owned the property. He had lived out on that lake for most of his adult life alongside his wife, who I was told was the joyful personality that Mr. Clifton simply couldn't produce and hold within his own demeanor. The couple lived a few miles down the shore of the vast lake in a modest hand-built house. The boxes that my dad had brought were partial payment for using the cabin. Bringing a restock of supplies to the Cliftons on our flight in to reduce the number of trips Hugo would otherwise have made. Two birds with one stone.

I proceeded to relocate the boxes for a few minutes when we were both made privy to the sound of an incoming engine across the lake. We both turned to face the outstretch of water to see a small motorized fishing boat making its way toward our position.

""There he is."" my dad noted, waving an outstretched arm above his head.

The water craft gently came to a slow rumble as it aligned itself with the dock, the gentle wake from the motor splashing against the shore of the lake. Aboard the boat stood Mr. Clifton, and to my surprise, Mrs. Clifton. My dad made his way over to the boat, assisting the white bearded man with tying the vessel to the dock post. He turned to me, gesturing a hand to come over and help. I snapped out of my daze of observation and jogged on over to the trio.

""James, this is Mr. and Mrs. Clifton,"" my dad said as he helped Mrs. Clifton onto the dock.

I extended a hand out, being initially greeted by the warm, gloved hand of Mrs. Clifton.

""Hi there! It's nice to meet you, James. I hope you and your father enjoy it out here. It's a wonderful time of year."" she said, her face lighting up as she spoke. She had the energy in her voice that I didn't expect from someone her age, but it was comforting to hear.

""It's nice to meet you too, Mrs. Clifton."" I replied.

I then turned to her husband with an extended hand once more. The man patted my dad on the arm before facing me, eyeing me up and down before embracing my hand with his own worn and calloused one. The strength of his grip caught me off guard for a simple handshake.

""Come on, give me a real handshake."" he said, squinting his eyes. I squeezed his hand in return to the best of my ability, but I felt my strength wouldn't matter in the face of the armored palm he had built up.

""Ah, good enough. Work on it."" He shook his head, turning to face my father. ""You finally put some meat on ya'. Makin' me look up to see ya'.""

My dad chuckled. ""Sorry I haven't been out here as much-""

""Ah, shush."" Mr. Clifton patted my dad's arm once again.

""You know, your dad used to come out here with your grandpa way back. He and Emmett used to take him out on the trails. They all used to go fishing and hunting together."" said Mrs. Clifton, turning to me.

""You been huntin' before?"" Mr. Clifton interjected, looking over as he raised one of the supply boxes in his arms.

""Once or twice,"" I replied, anticipating another judgmental jab from the old man. Surprisingly, it never came. He simply pursed his lips and nodded before hopping down into his boat and setting down the box.

""Oh, Emmett!"" Mrs. Clifton exclaimed, ""Can you grab the Tupperware I brought?""

Mr. Clifton muttered something under his breath before reaching into one of the boat's storage compartments and revealing a sealed plastic Tupperware. He extended his arms out and Mrs. Clifton eagerly took the container into her grasp.

""As a little welcome gift, I made you boys some maple sugar cookies!"" She exclaimed, holding her offering out to us. I smiled and accepted, transferring possession of the cookies.

""Thank you so much, really."" I replied, holding the container close to me as though I'd been gifted some incredible treasure. In retrospect, they might as well have been. I don't think any cookie has come close to the quality that Mrs. Clifton made for us that day.

""Mhmm. That's the best of the best right there."" Mr. Clifton interjected, letting out a coarse wheeze of a laugh.

""Is there anything you need from us while we're here? Things need to be done around the property?"" my dad asked, handing Mr. Clifton another box.

""Hmm. Well, just keep the place clean. Don't leave yer' trash easily accessible outside. You know, we got bears in the area. Sneaky bastards'll go through your trash and- Well, just take care of the place. Same rules it's always been."" Mr. Clifton scratched his balding head of hair as he searched for anything else he may have missed.

""Works for us, we'll keep the place in good order."" my dad chuckled.

""Oh, there's satellite phones inside that I made sure to get for ya'. Two of 'em, so you're both set should something happen. Best way to reach us too across the way if you two need anythin'."" added Mr. Clifton.

""Sounds good. Thank you again, been wanting to get this one out of the city for a while. He's gotta get out of that studio apartment once and a while."" My dad nudged my arm teasingly, side eyeing me for my reaction. I forced a small smile.

Mr. Clifton loaded the last of the supplies he needed into the boat before extending a hand out to Mrs. Clifton. She smiled and took his hand, stepping down into the boat as it gently swayed in the lake's wake.

""It was so nice to see you again, Benjamin, and it was wonderful getting to meet you as well, James."" said Mrs. Clifton, clasping her hands together.

My dad nodded and waved his hand to the couple before leaning down to assist in releasing the boat from the dock and tossing Mr. Clifton the rope.

""Get home safe! It was great seeing you both."" he responded, putting his hands on his hips.

""It's a great time to fish for trout, get out yer' gear while ya' can! Oh, and the pike are massive!"" called out Mr. Clifton as he brought the boat's engine to life, beginning to drift back out into the deeper waters of the lake.

I waved as well, joining my dad as we watched the elderly couple cruise off, a gentle slipstream following their engine and tumbling ashore.

My dad and I eventually got to work moving our belongings into the cabin. The front door being our first major obstacle as Mr. Clifton had installed the most intricate lock system I had ever seen for such a door. I assumed it was to prevent any curious bears from entering while the place was vacant, but I was no expert. I just figured that people weren't exactly a common occurrence all the way out here.

As much as I wasn't an avid outdoorsman, or even someone who left the city much, the place grew on me rather quickly. September brought about the beginnings of the autumn foliage which decorated the mountains in beautiful shades of yellow and orange that gradually assimilated the summer's green. The sunset crept in as we brought our unpacking to a close, bouncing rays of gold, and eventually pinks, purples, and oranges over the mountains and across the serene surface of the lake.

I remember watching the last of the daylight slip away as dusk oved to take its place. The calls of the loons echoed across the water, breaking through the ambience of smaller birds and insects that had sung their tunes since we had stepped off the seaplane. The thumping of my dad's boots across the dock caught my attention as he made his way to the folding chair next to mine.

""Hear that?"" he asked, coming up from behind me. I turned my head to look back at him, a brow raised.

""What? The loon?""

""Well, yeah. But everything.""

""What about it?""

""It's a good sign. When the woods are alive like this, it means there's probably no big predators in the area. Nothing for the little guys to worry about."" He placed he tray of Mrs. Clifton's cookies down on the small table between the chairs. ""Granted, we'll be heading deeper into the property than right here, but it's one of the good signs for hunters.""

He shoved one of the cookies into his mouth and took a seat next to me. I nodded, taking one for myself as well.

""Like bears?"" I asked, looking around at the woods behind me.

""Grizzlies, wolves, stuff like that,"" he said through chews. "" You warm enough, kiddo? It's gonna get colder real fast. I've got gloves in the house if you need 'em.""

I nodded again, holding up the hot chocolate that rested between my warmed hands. ""I'm fine.""

""Well, let me know,"" he insisted.

""Will do.""

We both sat quietly for a small while, taking in the scenery.

""How're things with you and that girl? What was her name?"" my dad asked.

I pursed my lips. ""Liz.""

""Yeah, her.""

""We broke things off back in March.""

""Oh, I didn't know you two-"" He sighed. ""You didn't tell me.""

I hesitated before responding, finding whatever wording I could. ""I know. Sorry.""

""You know, you can call me to tell me about this kind of thing. I know we don't live in the same state anymore, but,"" he placed his hand on my shoulder and swayed it gently, ""I'm still your dad.""

I swallowed the surprised grief that crept up my throat. ""I know.""

He ruffled the back of my hair with his palm and leaned back into his chair.

""My girlfriends when I was your age were crazier, don't worry. Did I ever tell you about Monica?""

""No.""

""Well, you'd know if you called more."" He smiled. ""But to tease the best part, your mom came and busted her lip at a party when Monica got drunk and wouldn't leave me be. Most attractive thing I'd ever seen, I asked her out the next week. Your mom was a tough, mean, momma bear! Except to me, of course.""

I smiled faintly. I could see my dad's line of sight had drifted out onto the lake. He sighed, grabbing another cookie off of the tray. I joined him, watching as the sun dipped behind the mountains completely, letting the cool tones of the evening sky blanket the land.

We sat on the dock for a few hours, sprinkles of conversation interrupting the silence as we enjoyed the ambience of the Yukon. Darkness had fully engulfed the atmosphere and the largest array of stars I had ever seen emerged to blanket the night sky. Occasional shooting stars broke through the static pinpoints of light and faded as fast as they appeared. As the night seemed to come to a close, we both spotted¬†*it*.

""You see that?"" I asked, leaning forward and pointing out across the lake and into the sky.

Through the sea of constellations, a brighter light emerged. It lingered in the sky unlike the shooting stars, growing more prevalent as it came into view. It silently and slowly arched across the sky at about the height of a commercial airline at first, but my dad and I both watched as it seemingly got closer to the earth below. The faintest of rumbling could be heard as the light grew in intensity. A mix of what appeared to be the orange glow of a flame as well as an array of smaller lights that seemed more ingrained in the object. This was my best guess from squinting to see it. Its speed became more apparent as it got closer, carrying with it the faint rumbling.

""The hell?"" My dad stood up from his chair and walked the rest of the few feet down the dock. We both watched as the object disappeared from view behind the mountain across from us, followed by a sudden, but muffled and distant thunder that echoed over the rolling mountain in the night air.

""Was that a plane or something?"" I asked, standing up as well. ""Should we call someone?""

My dad's puzzled expression turned to face me as I joined him. ""I don't know, maybe a satellite?""

""Satellites break up in the atmosphere. It wouldn't look like that, it'd be more like a bunch of fire balls."" I continued watching the mountain as if something would follow up to whatever we had witnessed. ""I saw it on the news before.""

""You saw the fiery bits though?""

""Yeah, maybe it was the plane's engine. Like something got damaged?""

""Maybe. Could've been something like the afterburners on jets. Saw those a lot in Kuwait.""

My dad and I stood there for what felt like a static eternity before he turned back to the cabin and rubbed the salt and pepper stubble that adorned his face.

""We'll see how things are in the morning. If it's got people on board, there's definitely gonna be a recovery effort. Crazy stuff."" He gestured for me to follow him back inside. ""C'mon. We gotta be up bright and early tomorrow morning.""

I turned to him and nodded.

The rest of the night brought nothing of note. The sounds of the wilderness persisted until I, at some point, fell asleep on one of the most uncomfortable beds I'd ever had the misfortune of sleeping upon. Helped in no part by the itchy wool blankets that adorned it.

The next morning greeted me with the intoxicating smell of cooked bacon, eggs, and coffee that wafted through the wooden cabin. I groaned as I pulled myself from bed, hitting the cool wooden floor and being made aware that I likely needed thicker socks.

After making the necessary accommodations, I trudged my way down the creaky wooden hall to the kitchen where my dad was already up and running. Upon the gas powered stove, old cast iron pans sat bearing the source of the aromas.

""Morning."" I mustered groggily.

My dad turned, a smile lighting up his face as I came into his view. ""I knew my cooking would get you up.""

He reached for one of the empty ceramic mugs on the counter top and poured me a fresh cup of coffee, the steam still rising from the surface of the liquid. I took it into my cold hands eagerly as though I had never known such warmth.

""Breakfast should be ready in just a minute. Two sunny-side-up eggs for you sounds good?"" My dad lifted the finished bacon from the pan and placed it onto the growing stack on a nearby plate.

""Yeah. Yeah, that's good.""

""Don't get so excited,"" he said sarcastically, ""Go outside and get some fresh air. Wake yourself up.""

I nodded and trudged across the main cabin space, slipping on a pair of slides and pushing open the creaky back door that led out to the dock area. I took a deep inhale as I walked out onto the grass, lifting the warm mug in hand up to my lips with a hesitant sip as to not scald my mouth so early on into the trip. The sun was just faintly rising over the mountains, casting rays of fresh light across the woods and breaching the morning haze that hung in the atmosphere.

As I spent a few minutes coming back to consciousness in the morning air with the help of the sun and caffeine, it struck me. I hadn't quite taken notice when I awoke or when I made my way outside initially, but something seemed out of place, or more so absent altogether.

The day prior, without interruption, a symphony of wildlife sounds hung in the air. Even initially after the odd event last night, the world remained alive and well in its chatter. But now, around the time morning birds should be casting their calls out into the breeze along with every other inhabitant of the woods, there was nothing.

I looked around, taking in the scenery around me. Visually, nothing appeared off. But there it was, or more so¬†*wasn't.*¬†The lack of any sound aside from the breeze and the gentle waves of the lake. Nature had gone silent.",3,1746887833.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

Hey fam, have you ever found yourself staring at the calendar wondering where all that time went? **If you‚Äôre over 50, it can be a little unsettling**, right? But guess what? This isn‚Äôt the time to hit the brakes ‚Äì it‚Äôs the moment to upgrade that mindset and embrace vitality in ways you might not have even considered.

I mean, let‚Äôs face it. At this age, it‚Äôs not about just surviving; it‚Äôs about thriving! Imagine looking back in ten years and saying, ‚ÄúWow, I really made the most of my time!‚Äù Instead of thinking it‚Äôs too late, how about we flip the script? Here are a few tips to cultivate that zest for life (and maybe even your next big adventure)!

### 1. **Embrace Curiosity**
**Remember when you were a kid and everything felt like a big adventure?** Pairing curiosity with your experiences can keep your mind sharp and eager. Try something new! Take that cooking class you‚Äôve been eyeing or join a book club. You never know what passion could ignite!

### 2. **Set Realistic Goals**
**I can‚Äôt stress this enough:** *Set realistic goals. Stay focused. Go home satisfied*. This is such a simple mindset tweak! Breaking down big dreams into smaller, manageable bites can be super freeing. Let‚Äôs say you want to travel more ‚Äì instead of planning a month-long trek to Europe, why not start with a weekend road trip? Baby steps are still steps forward!

### 3. **Stay Active**
**Physical activity is like magic for your mood!** Whether it‚Äôs gardening, walking the dog, or hitting the gym, just keep moving. Picture this: a lively dance party in your living room or that blissful feeling after a yoga session. *Who wouldn‚Äôt want to feel energetic and alive?* 

### 4. **Surround Yourself with Positivity**
**Life is too short for negativity, am I right?** Mingle with positive, inspiring folks who lift you higher. Ditch those energy vampires! Maybe it‚Äôs a friend, a club you join, or even an online community like this one! Let's cheer each other on as we take on this incredible chapter.

### 5. **Practice Gratitude**
**It‚Äôs easy to get bogged down by daily stress, but what if you spent five minutes a day reflecting on what brings you joy?** It can be as simple as that cup of coffee you love or the sunrise you caught this morning. Shifting focus to gratitude invites in positivity in a whole new way.

### 6. **Challenge Your Limits**
**Have you ever thought about how far you can push yourself?** Just because you hit a milestone in years doesn‚Äôt mean you have to stop trying new things or challenging your brain. Pick up a new language or start a DIY project. It‚Äôs never too late to shock yourself with what you can accomplish!

So, what do you think? Do these ideas resonate with you? Let‚Äôs chat about this because the idea of **cultivating vitality post-50** is just too good not to share! *And who knows? Maybe you‚Äôll inspire someone else to embrace this wave of positivity too!*",1,1746887592.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False
1kjbo41,https://www.reddit.com/r/macbook/comments/1kjbo41/advice_please/,Advice please,"Greetings all

Work is buying me a Macbook. There is no fixed budget and this is oddly a problem making my decision more confusing.

My use is light in including powerpoint, spreadsheets, word documents, email and the like. I will also watch some youtube, run some apps and maybe occasionally catch a netflix show (and game even more rarely).

I am confused between the 13"" Air and 14"" Pro, both being portable with acceptable footprints for a small table at a coffee shop for example.

I know the Pro would be most people's choice in this situation with Promotion and maybe even the M4Pro chip.

But. I cannot. Get around. The weight of the Pro compared to the Air. It's a small difference numerically but I can feel it in my bag which I actually tested. More importantly I often walk to meetings with \*just\* the laptop and then the weight difference is very very real.

I feel like going with the Air as I personally cannot tell a big difference between the Air and Pro screens. The Pro HDMI port to connect to screens for presentations and dongle-lessly to boot is lovely since I will use that a lot. Is there anything else I am missing by going with the Air?

Any inputs or advice would be welcome from this knowledgeable community so I don't have regrets next week when I ask work for one of these.

Thank you",1,1746887587.0,macbook,1,1.0,False

As a doubt (and someone who has tried every 'miracle' measure), I decided to test it properly for 30 days. Here's the raw truth ...  

  My lemonade protocol 

- 1 large organic lemon (juice)  
- 12 ounces hot water (not boiling)  
- First thing every morning (before coffee/meal)  
- Any other diet/exercise change (to separate the effect)  

 What did you work (science-supported benefits) 
1.  Better digestion 
   - Lemon citric acid stimulates stomach acid (if you have a slow digestion)  
   - My blotting is reduced by 10 days  

2.  Hydration Boost
   - Drink 2x more water daily (lemon taste cheated my brain!)  

3. Skin Glow 
   - Vitamin C increased collagen production (my acne mark slightly faded)  

  what not happened (Myths busted)   
1.  No ""magic"" fat burn 
   - Lost only 1.2 lbs (possibly water weight)  
   - Zero effect on belly fat (Dexa scan confirmed)  

2. Not a detox 
   - Your liver/kidney naturally detoxes - no food/drink changes  

 Watch out for 
- Tooth enamel erosion (use a straw!)  
-  angry  

 Pro Tip: 
For the benefit of real weight loss, with lemonade pair:  
- 30 grams of protein snacks within 1 hour  
- After drinking 10-minute walk distance (increases metabolism)  

final decision: 
Good for digestion/hydration, not hack of weight loss. Save your money on the ""Lemon detox"" scam!",15,1746887534.0,WeightLossAdvice,2,0.76,False

The restaurant doesn‚Äôt do reservations on weekends. But there is an online waiting list. I checked all morning until 915. There was no wait. On our way at 945, I checked again. The wait was 45 mins to an hour. 

He raised his voice at me for not making a reservation and for not keeping an eye on the waitlist. He‚Äôs good at getting people to do things for him, so he‚Äôs been able to get a reservation on weekends at this place. But when I told him two days ago that they won‚Äôt let me make a reservation, he didn‚Äôt offer to help. 

This morning, I woke up at 530 with our 18 month old toddler. It‚Äôs an early wake for her. She has a molar coming in. So I helped her get back to sleep. Then I had some coffee, showered, got myself ready, woke my husband up at 730 and 745 to take the dog out and get ready. He took his time and even ate before we went for brunch. He wasn‚Äôt even ready until 940. 

Then at 8, I woke up the baby. I fed her and took care of her all while prepping her things for the restaurant (snacks, cutlery, sticky plate, binds, some toys) and constantly checking the online waitlist. 

I explained to him that it‚Äôs difficult to watch the toddler, especially when nothing is baby proofed in our house, and keep checking the online waitlist. I tried my best without any help. He said his morning was hard enough with having to wake up early and taking the dog out. He said if I couldn‚Äôt keep watch, someone else in my family should have. 

My husband hasn‚Äôt done in overnight with our daughter in a year. He hasn‚Äôt done a morning with her where I can sleep in ever. He can‚Äôt even watch our daughter on his own for more than hour without losing her patience with her, letting her cry while he plays games on his phone, or falling asleep. 

There‚Äôs so much pressure to have another child, especially from his family and our mutual friends. But no one sees this stuff. No one sees the way he behaves when we‚Äôre alone. He comes off as such a caring father and great person to everyone. But silently this is how I‚Äôm treated and no one understands except a few of my close friends.

I reached out to see how he was only to know that he got married a week ago. I am glad to know he found the right person but I do often times wonder why would he leave me? I accepted his past, made him his favorite meals,made sure his home smells good, made his coffee and kept it on the table. I was the happiest with him. At the end, he decided to leave. I wonder did I do something wrong that he made this decison. It hurts to feel that I was never the chosen one. ",6,1746887369.0,ExNoContact,7,0.88,False

Pain dr recommended I get my GP to refer me to a rheumatologist to look into fibromyalgia and EDS

GP discouraged me from EDS (basically it's extremely hard to even get assessed without family history but how would my family ever get assessed given they don't have family history) but was on board with fibro. (Ontario, Canada. Americans: I always get a ton of well-meaning but completely unhelpful advice, none of this has anything to do with insurance & the system is different than yours.)

Anyway gp referred me to a rheumatologist . Couple weeks later I get a call from gp office saying my referral was rejected by the rheumatologist, and that all rheumatologists will reject this referral, and I should go to a pain doctor instead

Who I'm... Already going to... Who suggested this in the first place... and who has absolutely nothing to offer me by way of relief (other than a specific muscle relaxant that I researched and specifically requested).

I explained that I was already seeing a pain doc, and the pain doc was who recommended I ask my GP for the referral, and my GP is the one who chose to refer me specifically to rheumatology. I said I don't know what to tell you because I don't know what specialist I'm supposed to go to for this and it was the GP's decision. Like how am I supposed to know? Why the fuck is it on me to know which specialty diagnoses a fucking disease? She asked if I wanted to make another GP appointment and I said idk I'll think about it and call you back sometime.

I'm at the end of my fucking rope with this shit.

I'm thinking it's not worth fighting for this diagnosis. It seems like there's nothing they know how to do about it anyway other than things I'm already on for chronic migraine (SNRI, anti cgrp, tizanidine).",4,1746887069.0,Fibromyalgia,4,0.83,False

1kjbgai,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1kjbgai/cabin_on_the_lake_part_1/,Cabin on the Lake (Part 1),"I've sat here for more time than I care to admit attempting to put this into words: a cohesive structure. I wholeheartedly believe that the human brain struggles to process things past a certain point. Where, as a defense mechanism of sorts, it numbs itself to the severity of the events it bore witness to. I've even considered if I¬†*can*¬†speak about what happened. Truthfully, I don't think I carry enough evidence for it to matter in the end whether I publicize it or not. After all, I'm not supposed to be alive.

\-

I distinctly remember feeling nauseous as we flew from the small Canadian port out to the remote cabin on the lake that my father had rented for the nearly ten day trip. The sea plane was rocked by turbulence and the spotty flying of our pilot, Hugo, who was entrenched in conversation with my dad. The two men sharing a childlike wonder for the 'great outdoors' as men their age tend to do. I couldn't say I was bound for the same path, unfortunately. I had diverted from the family tradition, instead opting for the path of a starving artist. My dad had tried early on to sway me toward what he enjoyed, enlisting me into the cub scouts, and subsequently the boy scouts, but gave up around when I had turned twelve as my enthusiasm couldn't have been more absent. I knew he wasn't upset necessarily, just a bit sad that I couldn't bond with him on the same level.

The eventual landing that followed on the lake couldn't rip my dad and Hugo apart as they exchanged further stories and anecdotes. Unloading our gear from the aircraft was seemingly second to the conversation.

Eventually, the two exchanged pleasantries before Hugo clambered aboard his vessel and departed, leaving us on the dock of the isolated Yukon cabin.

""Hey, kiddo, mind helping me move these boxes over to the side? I wanna make sure that it's all separated for when Emmett gets here."" My dad gestured to a few large, plastic wrapped cardboard boxes mixed in with our own supplies.

""Who?"" I asked, thumping my way over as my boots knocked their way across the old wooden dock.

My dad taped his forehead with his fingers playfully.

""Mr. Clifton! My bad. Still refer to him by Mr. Clifton, okay?"" he said, lifting a larger box above his gut and carrying it over to its designated spot.

Mr. Clifton, as I'd been informed, was the man who actually owned the property. He had lived out on that lake for most of his adult life alongside his wife, who I was told was the joyful personality that Mr. Clifton simply couldn't produce and hold within his own demeanor. The couple lived a few miles down the shore of the vast lake in a modest hand-built house. The boxes that my dad had brought were partial payment for using the cabin. Bringing a restock of supplies to the Cliftons on our flight in to reduce the number of trips Hugo would otherwise have made. Two birds with one stone.

I proceeded to relocate the boxes for a few minutes when we were both made privy to the sound of an incoming engine across the lake. We both turned to face the outstretch of water to see a small motorized fishing boat making its way toward our position.

""There he is."" my dad noted, waving an outstretched arm above his head.

The water craft gently came to a slow rumble as it aligned itself with the dock, the gentle wake from the motor splashing against the shore of the lake. Aboard the boat stood Mr. Clifton, and to my surprise, Mrs. Clifton. My dad made his way over to the boat, assisting the white bearded man with tying the vessel to the dock post. He turned to me, gesturing a hand to come over and help. I snapped out of my daze of observation and jogged on over to the trio.

""James, this is Mr. and Mrs. Clifton,"" my dad said as he helped Mrs. Clifton onto the dock.

I extended a hand out, being initially greeted by the warm, gloved hand of Mrs. Clifton.

""Hi there! It's nice to meet you, James. I hope you and your father enjoy it out here. It's a wonderful time of year."" she said, her face lighting up as she spoke. She had the energy in her voice that I didn't expect from someone her age, but it was comforting to hear.

""It's nice to meet you too, Mrs. Clifton."" I replied.

I then turned to her husband with an extended hand once more. The man patted my dad on the arm before facing me, eyeing me up and down before embracing my hand with his own worn and calloused one. The strength of his grip caught me off guard for a simple handshake.

""Come on, give me a real handshake."" he said, squinting his eyes. I squeezed his hand in return to the best of my ability, but I felt my strength wouldn't matter in the face of the armored palm he had built up.

""Ah, good enough. Work on it."" He shook his head, turning to face my father. ""You finally put some meat on ya'. Makin' me look up to see ya'.""

My dad chuckled. ""Sorry I haven't been out here as much-""

""Ah, shush."" Mr. Clifton patted my dad's arm once again.

""You know, your dad used to come out here with your grandpa way back. He and Emmett used to take him out on the trails. They all used to go fishing and hunting together."" said Mrs. Clifton, turning to me.

""You been huntin' before?"" Mr. Clifton interjected, looking over as he raised one of the supply boxes in his arms.

""Once or twice,"" I replied, anticipating another judgmental jab from the old man. Surprisingly, it never came. He simply pursed his lips and nodded before hopping down into his boat and setting down the box.

""Oh, Emmett!"" Mrs. Clifton exclaimed, ""Can you grab the Tupperware I brought?""

Mr. Clifton muttered something under his breath before reaching into one of the boat's storage compartments and revealing a sealed plastic Tupperware. He extended his arms out and Mrs. Clifton eagerly took the container into her grasp.

""As a little welcome gift, I made you boys some maple sugar cookies!"" She exclaimed, holding her offering out to us. I smiled and accepted, transferring possession of the cookies.

""Thank you so much, really."" I replied, holding the container close to me as though I'd been gifted some incredible treasure. In retrospect, they might as well have been. I don't think any cookie has come close to the quality that Mrs. Clifton made for us that day.

""Mhmm. That's the best of the best right there."" Mr. Clifton interjected, letting out a coarse wheeze of a laugh.

""Is there anything you need from us while we're here? Things need to be done around the property?"" my dad asked, handing Mr. Clifton another box.

""Hmm. Well, just keep the place clean. Don't leave yer' trash easily accessible outside. You know, we got bears in the area. Sneaky bastards'll go through your trash and- Well, just take care of the place. Same rules it's always been."" Mr. Clifton scratched his balding head of hair as he searched for anything else he may have missed.

""Works for us, we'll keep the place in good order."" my dad chuckled.

""Oh, there's satellite phones inside that I made sure to get for ya'. Two of 'em, so you're both set should something happen. Best way to reach us too across the way if you two need anythin'."" added Mr. Clifton.

""Sounds good. Thank you again, been wanting to get this one out of the city for a while. He's gotta get out of that studio apartment once and a while."" My dad nudged my arm teasingly, side eyeing me for my reaction. I forced a small smile.

Mr. Clifton loaded the last of the supplies he needed into the boat before extending a hand out to Mrs. Clifton. She smiled and took his hand, stepping down into the boat as it gently swayed in the lake's wake.

""It was so nice to see you again, Benjamin, and it was wonderful getting to meet you as well, James."" said Mrs. Clifton, clasping her hands together.

My dad nodded and waved his hand to the couple before leaning down to assist in releasing the boat from the dock and tossing Mr. Clifton the rope.

""Get home safe! It was great seeing you both."" he responded, putting his hands on his hips.

""It's a great time to fish for trout, get out yer' gear while ya' can! Oh, and the pike are massive!"" called out Mr. Clifton as he brought the boat's engine to life, beginning to drift back out into the deeper waters of the lake.

I waved as well, joining my dad as we watched the elderly couple cruise off, a gentle slipstream following their engine and tumbling ashore.

My dad and I eventually got to work moving our belongings into the cabin. The front door being our first major obstacle as Mr. Clifton had installed the most intricate lock system I had ever seen for such a door. I assumed it was to prevent any curious bears from entering while the place was vacant, but I was no expert. I just figured that people weren't exactly a common occurrence all the way out here.

As much as I wasn't an avid outdoorsman, or even someone who left the city much, the place grew on me rather quickly. September brought about the beginnings of the autumn foliage which decorated the mountains in beautiful shades of yellow and orange that gradually assimilated the summer's green. The sunset crept in as we brought our unpacking to a close, bouncing rays of gold, and eventually pinks, purples, and oranges over the mountains and across the serene surface of the lake.

I remember watching the last of the daylight slip away as dusk oved to take its place. The calls of the loons echoed across the water, breaking through the ambience of smaller birds and insects that had sung their tunes since we had stepped off the seaplane. The thumping of my dad's boots across the dock caught my attention as he made his way to the folding chair next to mine.

""Hear that?"" he asked, coming up from behind me. I turned my head to look back at him, a brow raised.

""What? The loon?""

""Well, yeah. But everything.""

""What about it?""

""It's a good sign. When the woods are alive like this, it means there's probably no big predators in the area. Nothing for the little guys to worry about."" He placed he tray of Mrs. Clifton's cookies down on the small table between the chairs. ""Granted, we'll be heading deeper into the property than right here, but it's one of the good signs for hunters.""

He shoved one of the cookies into his mouth and took a seat next to me. I nodded, taking one for myself as well.

""Like bears?"" I asked, looking around at the woods behind me.

""Grizzlies, wolves, stuff like that,"" he said through chews. "" You warm enough, kiddo? It's gonna get colder real fast. I've got gloves in the house if you need 'em.""

I nodded again, holding up the hot chocolate that rested between my warmed hands. ""I'm fine.""

""Well, let me know,"" he insisted.

""Will do.""

We both sat quietly for a small while, taking in the scenery.

""How're things with you and that girl? What was her name?"" my dad asked.

I pursed my lips. ""Liz.""

""Yeah, her.""

""We broke things off back in March.""

""Oh, I didn't know you two-"" He sighed. ""You didn't tell me.""

I hesitated before responding, finding whatever wording I could. ""I know. Sorry.""

""You know, you can call me to tell me about this kind of thing. I know we don't live in the same state anymore, but,"" he placed his hand on my shoulder and swayed it gently, ""I'm still your dad.""

I swallowed the surprised grief that crept up my throat. ""I know.""

He ruffled the back of my hair with his palm and leaned back into his chair.

""My girlfriends when I was your age were crazier, don't worry. Did I ever tell you about Monica?""

""No.""

""Well, you'd know if you called more."" He smiled. ""But to tease the best part, your mom came and busted her lip at a party when Monica got drunk and wouldn't leave me be. Most attractive thing I'd ever seen, I asked her out the next week. Your mom was a tough, mean, momma bear! Except to me, of course.""

I smiled faintly. I could see my dad's line of sight had drifted out onto the lake. He sighed, grabbing another cookie off of the tray. I joined him, watching as the sun dipped behind the mountains completely, letting the cool tones of the evening sky blanket the land.

We sat on the dock for a few hours, sprinkles of conversation interrupting the silence as we enjoyed the ambience of the Yukon. Darkness had fully engulfed the atmosphere and the largest array of stars I had ever seen emerged to blanket the night sky. Occasional shooting stars broke through the static pinpoints of light and faded as fast as they appeared. As the night seemed to come to a close, we both spotted¬†*it*.

""You see that?"" I asked, leaning forward and pointing out across the lake and into the sky.

Through the sea of constellations, a brighter light emerged. It lingered in the sky unlike the shooting stars, growing more prevalent as it came into view. It silently and slowly arched across the sky at about the height of a commercial airline at first, but my dad and I both watched as it seemingly got closer to the earth below. The faintest of rumbling could be heard as the light grew in intensity. A mix of what appeared to be the orange glow of a flame as well as an array of smaller lights that seemed more ingrained in the object. This was my best guess from squinting to see it. Its speed became more apparent as it got closer, carrying with it the faint rumbling.

""The hell?"" My dad stood up from his chair and walked the rest of the few feet down the dock. We both watched as the object disappeared from view behind the mountain across from us, followed by a sudden, but muffled and distant thunder that echoed over the rolling mountain in the night air.

""Was that a plane or something?"" I asked, standing up as well. ""Should we call someone?""

My dad's puzzled expression turned to face me as I joined him. ""I don't know, maybe a satellite?""

""Satellites break up in the atmosphere. It wouldn't look like that, it'd be more like a bunch of fire balls."" I continued watching the mountain as if something would follow up to whatever we had witnessed. ""I saw it on the news before.""

""You saw the fiery bits though?""

""Yeah, maybe it was the plane's engine. Like something got damaged?""

""Maybe. Could've been something like the afterburners on jets. Saw those a lot in Kuwait.""

My dad and I stood there for what felt like a static eternity before he turned back to the cabin and rubbed the salt and pepper stubble that adorned his face.

""We'll see how things are in the morning. If it's got people on board, there's definitely gonna be a recovery effort. Crazy stuff."" He gestured for me to follow him back inside. ""C'mon. We gotta be up bright and early tomorrow morning.""

I turned to him and nodded.

The rest of the night brought nothing of note. The sounds of the wilderness persisted until I, at some point, fell asleep on one of the most uncomfortable beds I'd ever had the misfortune of sleeping upon. Helped in no part by the itchy wool blankets that adorned it.

The next morning greeted me with the intoxicating smell of cooked bacon, eggs, and coffee that wafted through the wooden cabin. I groaned as I pulled myself from bed, hitting the cool wooden floor and being made aware that I likely needed thicker socks.

After making the necessary accommodations, I trudged my way down the creaky wooden hall to the kitchen where my dad was already up and running. Upon the gas powered stove, old cast iron pans sat bearing the source of the aromas.

""Morning."" I mustered groggily.

My dad turned, a smile lighting up his face as I came into his view. ""I knew my cooking would get you up.""

He reached for one of the empty ceramic mugs on the counter top and poured me a fresh cup of coffee, the steam still rising from the surface of the liquid. I took it into my cold hands eagerly as though I had never known such warmth.

""Breakfast should be ready in just a minute. Two sunny-side-up eggs for you sounds good?"" My dad lifted the finished bacon from the pan and placed it onto the growing stack on a nearby plate.

""Yeah. Yeah, that's good.""

""Don't get so excited,"" he said sarcastically, ""Go outside and get some fresh air. Wake yourself up.""

I nodded and trudged across the main cabin space, slipping on a pair of slides and pushing open the creaky back door that led out to the dock area. I took a deep inhale as I walked out onto the grass, lifting the warm mug in hand up to my lips with a hesitant sip as to not scald my mouth so early on into the trip. The sun was just faintly rising over the mountains, casting rays of fresh light across the woods and breaching the morning haze that hung in the atmosphere.

As I spent a few minutes coming back to consciousness in the morning air with the help of the sun and caffeine, it struck me. I hadn't quite taken notice when I awoke or when I made my way outside initially, but something seemed out of place, or more so absent altogether.

The day prior, without interruption, a symphony of wildlife sounds hung in the air. Even initially after the odd event last night, the world remained alive and well in its chatter. But now, around the time morning birds should be casting their calls out into the breeze along with every other inhabitant of the woods, there was nothing.

I looked around, taking in the scenery around me. Visually, nothing appeared off. But there it was, or more so¬†*wasn't.*¬†The lack of any sound aside from the breeze and the gentle waves of the lake. Nature had gone silent.",2,1746886982.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

1kjbdxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/XRPWorld/comments/1kjbdxq/bitcoin_vs_xrp_what_every_new_investor_needs_to/,Bitcoin vs. XRP: What Every New Investor Needs to Know Before Buying Crypto,"
When most people hear the word Bitcoin, they think of innovation, freedom, or perhaps even getting rich. But the truth is, Bitcoin isn‚Äôt what many people believe it is ‚Äî and it certainly isn‚Äôt positioned to become the money of the future. That role is more likely to go to a digital asset you may not have heard as much about: XRP.

Bitcoin was originally introduced in 2008 as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system ‚Äî a way to send value online without a bank. Sounds great in theory, but in practice, it hasn‚Äôt worked out that way. Over time, Bitcoin has become too slow, too expensive, and too inefficient to function like real money. Transactions can take minutes or hours, fees can spike unpredictably, and the system uses more electricity than some countries.

To compensate, supporters shifted the narrative, branding Bitcoin as ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù‚Äîa store of value rather than a usable currency. But this pivot reveals the truth: Bitcoin failed at being money. And because of its structural limitations, it will continue to fail in that role.

The Truth About Bitcoin‚Äôs Limitations
Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äústore of value‚Äù pitch wasn‚Äôt the plan.
Bitcoin was introduced as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, not as a form of digital gold. The idea of it being a store of value only emerged after the original plan‚Äîto serve as a decentralized digital currency‚Äîproved too difficult to scale. This narrative shift was not intentional innovation but rather a compromise born from technical failure.

It doesn‚Äôt really do anything.
Unlike newer blockchains that offer smart contracts, decentralized apps, and integrated finance tools, Bitcoin has a single function: transfer and store value. There are no built-in features that allow developers to build on top of the network or expand its capabilities, making it a passive, inflexible system.

Mining is centralized.
Though Bitcoin was designed to be decentralized, mining has become concentrated in the hands of a few large mining pools, often located in countries with cheap electricity and limited regulation. This contradicts the claim that Bitcoin is truly trustless or evenly distributed, since most transaction validations are controlled by a small number of entities.

Early adopters benefit most.
Bitcoin's structure heavily favors those who got in early. The vast majority of coins are held by a small percentage of wallets. As new investors join the market, their capital tends to flow toward enriching those early holders‚Äîcreating a wealth concentration dynamic not unlike that of pyramid schemes or insider markets.

The community can be dogmatic.
The Bitcoin community often exhibits an extreme form of loyalty that discourages open criticism or discussion about the coin‚Äôs flaws. Competing technologies are frequently dismissed or attacked, and dissenting voices are marginalized. This kind of dogmatism can hinder technological evolution and stifle innovation.

Price manipulation is real.
Numerous studies and market analyses have shown that Bitcoin's price is frequently influenced by large injections of unbacked stablecoins, especially Tether (USDT), as well as wash trading on unregulated exchanges. This creates artificial price floors and surges, deceiving retail investors into thinking demand is higher than it actually is.

It‚Äôs an environmental liability.
Bitcoin‚Äôs proof-of-work model requires enormous computational power, leading to energy consumption that surpasses some countries. This creates a significant environmental burden, especially when compared to modern networks that achieve the same result using a fraction of the energy.

It‚Äôs too slow and too expensive to use practically.
Bitcoin transactions can take 10 minutes to an hour or more to confirm, and fees can rise dramatically during periods of congestion. This makes it impractical for everyday use, such as buying a coffee, paying a bill, or transacting across borders in real time.

It‚Äôs not quantum-resistant.
Bitcoin relies on cryptographic standards that are theoretically vulnerable to quantum computers. Once quantum capabilities become mainstream, Bitcoin‚Äôs security could be at risk. Unlike more adaptive networks, Bitcoin is difficult to upgrade due to its rigid community governance structure.

Why XRP Is Built for Real Utility
XRP was created to solve the problems Bitcoin couldn‚Äôt. It runs on the XRP Ledger, a high-performance blockchain that uses a consensus protocol instead of mining. Transactions settle in 3 to 5 seconds, cost a fraction of a cent, and use negligible energy. The network can handle thousands of transactions per second‚Äîmaking it scalable for global financial use.

XRP is divisible into drops (1 XRP = 1,000,000 drops), just like Bitcoin has satoshis. But unlike Bitcoin, XRP is actually usable for microtransactions in the real world. It‚Äôs fast, cheap, and efficient enough for daily use.

Most importantly, XRP was designed to work with banks and payment systems, not against them. It functions as a bridge currency, making it easy to transfer value between different fiat currencies globally without needing to hold reserves. This solves a major issue in global finance: liquidity.

XRP is also ISO 20022-compliant, meaning it aligns with new global financial messaging standards. It‚Äôs ready to be integrated into traditional financial systems, giving it an edge in regulatory and institutional adoption.

Because of its lightweight and fast infrastructure, XRP could even function via satellite or in off-world environments. Its potential isn‚Äôt just global‚Äîit‚Äôs interplanetary.

The XRP supply is capped at 100 billion tokens, with a significant portion held in escrow and released gradually. A small amount is burned with each transaction, introducing a sustainable deflationary mechanism. The XRP Ledger has never been hacked and is already in use by financial institutions worldwide.

Conclusion: The Future Belongs to Function
Bitcoin started the crypto revolution, but it‚Äôs clear it won‚Äôt lead the next one. Its design flaws‚Äîlimited scalability, energy waste, centralized mining, and poor adaptability‚Äîhave made it more of a digital relic than a real currency of the future. It sparked the movement, but it isn‚Äôt fit to lead it anymore.

XRP is everything Bitcoin isn‚Äôt: fast, cheap, scalable, sustainable, and built for real-world‚Äîand even off-world‚Äîuse. It‚Äôs ready to integrate with modern financial systems and solve real problems today, not just serve as a speculative asset.

If the future of money is global, real-time, regulated, and technologically advanced, XRP‚Äînot Bitcoin‚Äîis the tool designed for the job.",1,1746886799.0,XRPWorld,0,1.0,False

# 2 Samuel 10:9

* *When Joab saw that the battle was set against him both in front and in the rear, he chose some of the best men of Israel and arrayed them against the Syrians.*[](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Samuel%2010&version=ESV)

This is a picture of life in this world. Wherever we turn, we face enemies. Joab teaches us a lesson in warfare. He prepared to face both the enemies in front and those behind. He never turned his back on an enemy.

This teaches us that Christians should never expose their backs to the enemy. We should always face our challenges head-on.

Another valuable lesson from Joab is that he chose his best men to fight the hardest battles, to face the most dangerous enemies. Our great Captain, Jesus, gives His toughest battles to His strongest soldiers. If we feel like our temptations are harder than others‚Äô or that our enemies are more difficult to overcome, we should remember that Christ picks His bravest soldiers to face the hardest fights.",1,1746886677.0,TheDailyDose,0,1.0,False
1kjbbyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1kjbbyr/unsure_what_to_do_im_really_struggling/,Unsure what to do I'm really struggling,"I'm really struggling. Me and my boyfriend moved pretty fast. We felt a deep connection quickly and things were great. Around 6months I was living with my family and they were moving to 5 hours away. 

I didn't want to be away from him and neither did he so we got an apartment together. Things were good for a little then we started to argue a lot. Yelling, cursing, him storming out. Things were tereible We weren't communicating as well as I wanted I would try to talk and he just wanted to be left alone.

This put a strain on our relationship. I found out he had been cheating. He had an old post when he was with his ex about looking for a third and started answering comments and messaging women on there some pictures we had a big fight. He claimed they never sexted and it was just asking what each other was looking for and them wanting to see what he looks like and I saw a message saying he was ok to meet up.

I found out because I had a really bad feeling and looked through his phone. (I had full trust in him and had never done this till then) I found the post which was clearly old but the messages weren't. I didn't see everything he took it from me and we sat down and talked. He answered every painful question I asked and didn't blame me for any of it. He claims he was never going to meet anyone and just wanted an escape.

He took responsibility for his actions and said he had never cheated before and said he just wanted to get away from our situation of always fighting and that it was an escape. 

I see why he did it we were in a really bad spot. though I don't condone it. After that I was heartbroken and went into fix it mode I told him if he wanted any chance of this to work he would need to stop using that social media and social media in general, go to individual counseling, couple's counseling, not make anymore female friends, not go out for a couple of months for us to work on just us, I can see his phone anytime with or without permission. And that I have a foot out the door saving to potentially leave him.

He did everything I asked. He supported me and comforted me. He never blamed me and was remorseful. I truly believe he is sorry for hurting me and what he did. After that it was hard but things took a complete 180. 

Things were great we were communicating so much better, no yelling, no cursing, we gave each other space when needed. I started trusting him more and he went out on his own more. I didn't check his phone every other day. He would bring my flowers every month on our anniversary day. He would bring me coffee every week. He would rub my feet, give me massages,try to get us to go out clean and cook for me since I am very busy with college and a full-time job.

I felt like things were kinda normal this was over a year we had been working on our relationship. A few weeks ago I just felt distant. Awkward like things were weird between us. I think I was depressed and overwhelmed with school, work, my mom's health declining, then our relationship it was too much. I started back on antidepressants but I broke up with him.

It really hurt and I wasn't 100% sure it's what I wanted but things felt weird like I was feeling numb. I went to counseling which is helping but now I'm just unsure if I want to stay broken up. We live and work together we have 10 months on our lease. I truly believe he is a good man and a good partner who make terrible choices. But I'm struggling on what to do. I love him and he loves me we agreed for now to stay broken up and work on ourselves and maybe we could come back together. 

He wants me to trust him again and stop looking though his phone he gets emotional and tells me it was bad choices but it has never happened again and that he is very sorry. And hopes I can trust him again. He still always gives it to me when asked but I can tell he is hurt. I love him and all of this is really hard and confusing.

1kjbaw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PatioParadise/comments/1kjbaw6/are_omelaza_patio_loveseats_the_best_choice/,Are Omelaza Patio Loveseats the Best Choice? Must-Read Review on Outdoor Comfort!,"Testing patio furniture is one of my favorite hobbies, and the Omelaza B08QD8FFZF patio bench didn‚Äôt disappoint with its vibrant promises and design. As I set it up in my backyard, I was excited to see if it lived up to the hype. This outdoor glider comes in a stunning peacock blue, making it a lively addition to any garden, patio, or lawn. Its olefin fabric cushions seemed promising in both durability and comfort.

**Design and Style**  
The first thing that caught my attention was the patio bench's sleek design paired with its splash of peacock blue color. The gourd-style embellishments on the armrests provide a whimsical yet modern touch, leaving me impressed. This loveseat‚Äôs style fits multiple settings‚Äîwhether you want it by the poolside, in the garden, or even on a small porch. It‚Äôs versatile enough to enhance both outdoor and indoor aesthetics. At 47.24 inches in length, it‚Äôs spacious enough for two people, but it doesn‚Äôt take up an unreasonable amount of space. 

**Ease of Assembly**  
Assembling furniture can sometimes be a nerve-wracking ritual, but this bench surprised me. The package contains clear instructions, and all tools and hardware are provided, minimizing any extra hassle. While a second pair of hands speeds up the process, I managed to assemble it solo in about an hour and a half over the weekend, fueled by caffeine and determination. Picturing myself enjoying coffee on this glider as I built it kept me motivated. 

[Check Omelaza B08QD8FFZF price on Amazon.](https://patioboutique.com/p/b08qd8ffzf/)

**Cozy Features**  
The 3.9-inch thick cushions are where this patio bench truly shines in comfort. The olefin fabric feels luxurious to touch and boasts weather resistance, which is a lifesaver for someone like me who forgets to bring cushions indoors when it drizzles. I appreciated the straps on the cushions, keeping them firmly in place so that they don‚Äôt slide off when the kids excitedly hop onto the bench. While seated, the gentle gliding motion feels heavenly, making it ideal for relaxing mornings or lazy evenings.

**Advantages**  
- The peacock blue color adds a pop of vibrancy to any space.  
- The sturdy wrought iron frame supports up to 500 lbs, perfect for two people.  
- Glider mechanism offers a dual purpose: a stationary bench and a swinging experience.  
- Weather-resistant fabrics ensure longevity for outdoor use.  

**Bad Points**  
- The height isn‚Äôt adjustable, which might not suit everyone‚Äôs comfort preferences.  
- Assembly is easier with two people, which might not be feasible for everyone.  

**Performance and Durability**  
Taking performance into account, the durability of this bench blew me away. After testing it for a few hours daily over two weeks, the material showed no signs of wear. Steel frames with powder coating keep it rust-resistant, even when exposed to morning dew and light rain. However, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend leaving it uncovered during heavy downpours. The connecting rod at the base provides added stability, which reassures me every time the kids tumble onto it during their play sessions. It‚Äôs the kind of furniture piece that can take some abuse and still hold strong.

**Rival Brands**  
Comparing this patio loveseat to others in its category, I found that many competing products lack the combination of style, comfort, and durability offered here. Similar items at this price point often sacrifice comfort, introducing thinner cushions that aren‚Äôt as breathable or securely fitted. That said, a few premium brands offer more elaborate swing mechanisms and customizable aesthetics but at a much steeper price. If you‚Äôre after affordability without compromising quality, this glider hits just the right notes.

**Affordable Quality**  
Is this patio bench worth its price tag? In my opinion, it is. You‚Äôre getting a visually appealing, highly functional piece of furniture at a fraction of what some luxury brands charge. While it‚Äôs certainly an investment, the durability, comfort, and aesthetic value it brings to your outdoor space make it worthwhile. While there are cheaper alternatives, they rarely match the fabric quality and stability of this model.

What Jesus teaches about Living with a servant‚Äôs heart

Introduction
------------

Have you ever wondered what it truly means to live with a servant‚Äôs heart? In today‚Äôs fast-paced world, the idea of servanthood might seem counterintuitive. Yet, embracing this mindset opens the door to a life rich in purpose and fulfillment. Jesus teaches us that greatness is found in serving others, and this perspective transforms how we interact with the people around us.

Imagine a life where lifting others becomes your source of joy, where simple acts of kindness ripple out and impact the world in profound ways. This is the life Jesus invites us into‚Äîa life filled with compassion, humility, and love. Stay with us as we explore how living with a servant‚Äôs heart can enrich your life and those you touch each day.

Bible Verse
-----------

‚ÄúFor even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.‚Äù ‚Äî Mark 10:45 (NIV)

Meaning
-------

This verse is a powerful reminder of Jesus‚Äô mission on earth. He, the King of Kings, did not seek to be served but chose instead to serve others, ultimately sacrificing His life for humanity. His example urges us to evaluate our own lives and consider how we can emulate His selflessness and love.

A servant‚Äôs heart is not about being passive or weak; it‚Äôs about choosing to put the needs of others before our own with genuine humility. By doing so, we reflect the love of Christ and find true greatness.

Jesus‚Äô teachings challenge us to redefine success not by status or power but by our ability to positively impact others. The humility and grace He exemplified encourage us to step away from self-centered ambitions and to live a life enriched by service to others.

Embracing a servant‚Äôs heart leads us to deeper connections, fuels our purpose, and allows us to walk in the footsteps of Jesus. It invites us to see others through compassionate eyes and respond with love and action.

Actions to Take
---------------

‚Äì Volunteer in your community or church to help those in need.

‚Äì Practice listening actively, ensuring others feel heard and valued.

‚Äì Perform random acts of kindness, such as paying for someone‚Äôs coffee or leaving an encouraging note.

‚Äì Reflect on your daily interactions and ask yourself how you can be more selfless.

‚Äì Offer your time and talents to support those around you without expecting anything in return.

Journal Prompts
---------------

‚Äì How can I serve others in my daily life?

‚Äì What does living with a servant‚Äôs heart mean to me personally?

‚Äì Reflect on a time when someone served you selflessly. How did it impact you?

‚Äì In what areas of my life can I practice more humility and servanthood?

‚Äì How do I feel Jesus is calling me to serve today?

Prayer
------

Dear Lord, thank You for the ultimate example of love and service You have shown through Jesus. Help me to live each day with a servant‚Äôs heart, putting others before myself. Grant me the wisdom to know where I am needed, the courage to step out in faith, and the humility to serve with joy. May my actions reflect Your love and bring glory to Your name. Amen.

Recently I‚Äôve changed my attitude toward dating and I would rarely ever go on a dinner date for a first time meet and greet because great relationships have come out of that approach. Anyone who likes you will
Like you because of your genuineness not what you can give them. For the past 6 months I‚Äôve pivoted from a coffee, bar, or social setting meeting to planning dinner dates instead to mix up things and be open minded.

In my last 6 months I think dinner dates took
things into the wrong direction. They were less creative and didn‚Äôt bring the best out of me nor my dates. They also were costly ranging from 150 - 200+ Including nice tip. And the connections lasted about 2-3 dates before things fazed out. By no means is this because we had dinner but because a stronger connection wasn‚Äôt created prior and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôd opt for more useful date ideas that will help a person who is interested in getting a better idea before both invest into spending time with each other.

Here‚Äôs why I will never do dinner dates not unless a connection is established and will convert back to a more simple approach. This is not for anyone who enjoys doing a dinner date when meeting someone for a first time that‚Äôs absolutely fine for you. 
* Dinner dates can be very costly and create the wrong intentions
* Dinner dates don‚Äôt equal a better connection (don‚Äôt believe what anyone tells you)
* It‚Äôs hard to get to know someone when your eating and not actually engaging and talking 
* Dinner dates can set the wrong precedence over time especially if it‚Äôs not what you enjoy doing every time 
* If there is no connection this may create an awkward moment 
* Dinner should be a special milestone after you get to know someone when both parties show interest in moving forward

Here are some alternatives to dinner that has worked better and built a more sound connection than going on dinner dates 
* Coffee/ tea shop with some light snacks 
* Bar which serves wine and maybe some small appetizers 
* Park walk 
* Picnic and both can agree upon bringing something 
* A phone or video date chat
* Ice-cream and a hang by the water/river 
* Museum is great cause you can get a good idea of things the person likes art wise 
* After any of the above a good old school slice (who doesn‚Äôt like pizza) 

Here‚Äôs some risky first date ideas
* Movie theater 
* Family get together
* Going to someone else‚Äôs home without meeting 
* Club / lounge 
* Comedy show (good date idea but after getting to know someone) 

Hope this helps someone who is on the fence and know you can take in slow and anyone who doesn‚Äôt accept it is not for you.",6,1746886489.0,dating_advice,8,0.75,False

**Why This Pick?**

With two relatively new pitchers on the mound for both teams this evening, I think we‚Äôll see another high-scoring affair here at hitter-friendly Coors Field. Bradley Blalock (8.03 ERA) will start for the Rockies, while Stephen Kolek will make just his 2nd start for San Diego. It‚Äôs no secret that Colorado‚Äôs pitching staff has been a mess; I imagine this will be another case of the Padres running up an early score and the Rockies batting a handful in once San Diego‚Äôs bullpen takes over. I‚Äôm on this encounter to see at least 12 runs, friends.¬†

1kjb9cw,https://www.reddit.com/r/coldemail/comments/1kjb9cw/last_year_i_tested_these_4_cold_email_tweaks_and/,Last year I tested these 4 COLD EMAIL tweaks and closed $527k in closed deals for clients.,"just wanted to share a breakdown of how we approach ab testing in cold email copywriting most people

focus on tiny stuff like should i say hey first name or hello first name truth is that barely moves the needle what actually matters are the offers.

the outcomes the problems and the value props we test those over and over....

1. offers are the core of the email what are you helping them do and how can you say it in a way they care about one offer we used to crush was hey we helped another recruiting agency land so many deals they had to hire more recruiters want me to send the video of how we did it no hard pitch just curiosity and value
2. outcomes work when tied to mini case studies example hey not sure if youd be interested but we helped another dental company add 30k in revenue last month want to see how we did it people love specific outcomes
3. problem sniffing is underrated look for signals like company size or recent growth and mention the pain points they are probably feeling one time we scraped websites that had lots of support articles for csv imports and sent emails like hey noticed you have 7 support articles mentioning csv imports curious if that is something you want to make easier that got crazy reply rates
4. we also break down value props into save time save money or make more money everything b2b is basically one of those sometimes we even build full lead magnets like offering 5000 free leads or a list of verified prospects for free just to hook the prospect in and use scrapeamax by leadamax to scrape unlimited lead lists for less than my coffee budget

and my favourite move when nothing works give away the farm if your offer is struggling offer it for free

if no one says yes it is the offer not your cold email campaign we use fake domains to test insane free offers to validate what people want without risking client brands

all of this works because we try to be doctors not used car salesmen ask the prospect

if they have a problem and offer to help rather than just blasting features example hey other companies like yours struggle to sync data between crm and payment processing is that a challenge for you too

this is how we approach testing and campaign troubleshooting hope this helps anyone else running cold email outbound always happy to swap ideas or hear what others are testing right now",0,1746886440.0,coldemail,4,0.5,False

1kjb92o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gaza/comments/1kjb92o/reportage_voices_from_a_starving_land/,Reportage: Voices from a Starving Land,"Since the beginning of the war on Gaza, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about the people trapped under siege. No food, no water, no electricity, no income‚Äîand no way out. Three months ago, Israel announced a complete siege on Gaza and its people: elderly, children, women, the sick, the disabled, and the men. All crossings were closed, and nothing was allowed to enter the Strip‚Äînot even financial support. Israel also shut down all money transfer offices, cutting Gazans off from any outside help.

Out of curiosity and empathy, I turned to TikTok. I searched for real people in Gaza, wanting to understand how they survive, how they find the strength to speak, and especially‚Äîhow they still smile. Their smiles were pure, despite hunger and pain. That touched me deeply.

At first, I watched their videos and lives in silence, randomly during the day and mostly in the evenings, scrolling before sleep. I wanted to learn more‚Äîthen I wanted to connect. And one day, I did.

A Cry for Bread

A woman from central Gaza caught my attention. She kept liking my posts. Curious, I visited her profile‚Äîeverything she posted was about survival. I reached out: ‚ÄúHi sister, how are you? Is there anything I can do for you?‚Äù

She replied with tears. Nadia, 39, unmarried, never employed, with absolutely no income, lives with 22 others in one house. She was starving but too shy to say so. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a child,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúbut I‚Äôm so hungry and haven‚Äôt eaten in days.‚Äù I had tears in my eyes. I couldn‚Äôt take another sip of my tea‚ÄîI gave her my full attention. She asked if we could talk over the phone. I said yes.

She explained how flour was everything. It‚Äôs not sold by the kilo but in 25 kg sacks‚Äîand even those were rare. In the past few days, the price jumped from $300 to $800. I offered to help. In my mind, I planned to donate $100‚Äì200. She said, ‚ÄúPlease, buy us bread. It costs $300. We haven‚Äôt tasted it in so long. The kids need it.‚Äù I agreed to send the $300. She said PayPal was still working in her area, and her niece had an account. I tried, but it failed. She begged me not to give up. ‚ÄúYou gave me hope. Don‚Äôt take it away. Please‚Äîwe‚Äôre hungry.‚Äù

Eventually, through a friend, we managed to send her $10. She immediately used it to buy two 500g bags of pasta and cooked them‚Äîjust enough for one meal for the whole house. Nothing for tomorrow.

More Voices, More Hunger

I spoke to others‚Äîlike Yousef, a young man in the south who goes live on TikTok daily. Not for fun, but for survival. ‚ÄúThis is how we earn‚Äîby going live, hoping someone will join and send us TikTok gifts,‚Äù he told me. I learned TikTok takes 50% to 70% of donations. A $100 gift may only bring $25 to the person in need.

Yousef is the eldest of five and responsible for the entire family, including his parents. He said his aunt‚Äôs tent caught fire, and soon she and her family will move into his.

I asked about their struggle‚Äîbeyond the indiscriminate killings and the collective punishment of the total siege now entering its third month. How do they survive? Is it a money issue or a supply issue? ‚ÄúBoth,‚Äù they said. Even with money, there‚Äôs barely anything to buy. Here‚Äôs what I found:

Flour: $800 for 25 kg, if available at all‚Äîthe most expensive item in Gaza, and its price increases by the hour.

Water: $1 per cup, $30 per bottle.

Milk: $22 per liter.

Eggs: $40 for 30, or $1.50‚Äì$2 each.

Vegetables: $10‚Äì15 per kg.

Oil: Corn oil only‚Äî$20 per liter.

Tea: $15 per box.

Coffee: $70 per kg.

Sugar: $30 per kg.

Pasta: $5 for 500g‚Äîoften crushed to make flour.

Cheese and bananas: Don‚Äôt exist.

Meat, beef, poultry: Unavailable. Fish is extremely rare and very expensive.

Meals: One per day, usually lunch. No breakfast. No dinner.

A Name Behind the Numbers

Electricity? Cut since October 2023. Phones are charged using solar energy‚Äîif the sun is out. Otherwise, no way to connect with the outside world.

When I asked about water, I was told people start lining up at 4 a.m. Trucks come twice a week. The water is of the lowest quality‚Äîundrinkable anywhere else‚Äîand it tastes awful. There is no organized distribution: first come, first served. The strong take more. The weak get none. Yet this is what people drink and give to their children.

Relief packages may arrive every one or two months: a bit of oil, pasta, and canned food. No flour for five months. These small packages last about 10 days‚Äîassuming only one meal is eaten per day.

Yousef, son of Gaza, is 19. Sweet, lively, hopeful, and polite. He dreamed of being a footballer. He trained with a team before the war, along with his cousin Mustafa, who now lives in a neighboring tent. Now, he‚Äôs starving‚Äîlike everyone else.

‚ÄúWe will rebuild it again, no matter what.‚Äù

I also spoke to Zaid, a smart, lighthearted architect in his late twenties from Gaza. When I asked him how people get money, he explained that Vodafone Cash via Egypt is the only reliable method. But it‚Äôs complicated. A Gazan must know someone trustworthy in Egypt. The donor sends money to this person via bank transfer, MoneyGram, PayPal, or Western Union. That person deposits it in Vodafone Cash and receives a receipt. The Gazan recipient must go to a Vodafone branch with a copy of the receipt to cash the money‚Äîand immediately use it to buy food.

‚ÄúBread is a symbol of life here,‚Äù Zaid told me. ‚ÄúWhen kids cry at night from hunger, a piece of bread helps.‚Äù He also explained the challenge of cooking. They need firewood, but there‚Äôs barely any. Starting and maintaining a fire‚Äîeven just to boil tea‚Äîis an exhausting task.

I‚Äôll include the social media details of my new friends in Gaza in this article for anyone who wants to follow or support them.

We take many things for granted: food, water, cleanliness, security, justice, and home. Lately, we‚Äôve come to treat the suffering in Gaza and Palestine as if it were normal. We watch the unbelievable and pretend it is nothing. This is a final call‚Äîbefore it‚Äôs too late‚Äîand we find ourselves unable to forgive our silence.
