1r8y360,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1r8y360/the_hoe_in_hotel/,The Hoe in Hotel,"A crushed pack of Pall Malls balanced on the dashboard as I drove through the dark with everything I owned rattling behind me in cardboard boxes. The ashtray overflowed. My mother’s station wagon groaned on every lane change, seat ripped open, glue stains on the floor, and the whole car stinking of cigarettes and motel soap. My whole life fit inside this car, a rolling, rusted coffin parked now beneath the blinding lights of a gas station. I stepped out, the door screaming on its hinges, and walked under the neon wash, following the squeak of my sneakers through the cool air and tang of bleach. I picked up some snacks and headed for the register.

“Pall Mall Blue, shorts.” I pointed at the carton behind the young man. 

Even when I pointed it out, he stared right past it. Silence. I leaned over the counter and grabbed a pack myself. “Any good motels around here?” He just blinked. Another pause. The young man took a long time ringing up the few items I held.

“Down the road. You’ll come up on it. It’s on the left-hand side. It’s the Beaver Town Motel, you can't miss it.” The boy finished up his scan, and I took all my shit and got out of there. 

I put some gas in the tank before heading out to find the motel the boy was talking about. Hopefully, it was somewhat decent. I needed a place to bunker down for a while, cause it was taking me a while to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. Sure enough, I saw it, hanging on the left-hand side with a big ole neon sign showing off two open legs, one on the side of the B for beaver, and the other leg was spread open to the N in town. I pulled into the mostly deserted parking lot and took a look around before getting out of my car. I hated that druggies came begging for money as soon as you pulled up somewhere. I can't even pay for myself, how do they think I'm gonna pay for their drugs? The parking lot was still, with garbage strewn around the worn-out asphalt, and all I could hear were muffled conversations happening somewhere around where I was parked. I got out of my car, locked it up, and made my way to the front office. The door chimed open, and the overbearing fluorescent lights caught me off guard. I walked up to a young woman sitting behind the counter, her nose stuck to her phone. 

“I need a room here for a while.” I walked up and put my hands down on the desk to draw her attention. 

“What's a while”? She didn't even look up from her phone. 

“I don't know for four or five days.” I wasn't sure at that moment how long I would have to stay here until I hopped to my next destination. 

“You’re a lifer.” The girl muttered under her breath as she put her phone down and sat up. 

“I am a what?” I cocked my head over and put my ear closer to where she was standing. 

“You’re a lifer.” A snark came out, and she sighed. “There are lifers, and there are floaters. You're gonna ground yourself in here for a while. Try to make sense of things? Yeah. You're not going anywhere for a long while.” She let out a laugh and typed around on the computer. 

“You can have room 2G, it's a real den of a place.” She was being sarcastic. My fingers tapped out a quick staccato on the counter, my jaw tightening. I had no patience left for underdeveloped teenagers barely looking up from their phones.

“Thanks.” I took my key card and walked out of the office back into the moist night air. 

I found the old concrete steps that led up to the second floor, my hand rubbing over rusted patches of metal from the hand guard. I found my room and opened it up. Home sweet home. I was happy to at least afford a king-size bed. I pulled back the blankets covering the mattress and looked down at the yellow- and brown-stained white sheets. I pulled everything off the bed and threw it aside before going back to my car and getting some of my bags. On my way back up to my room, I noticed a woman, all done up, really scrawny, who was struggling to walk in her stilts next to some older guy who was noble enough to wear a suit. I said good evening as I passed and continued on my way to my destination. I put my own sheets and blankets over the other side of the decent mattress and even brought in my own pillows. I set myself up really nicely in this room before I called it and went to bed. The next morning, I got up and trudged down to the office to look into getting a job. The young girl at the counter was gone, and in her place was a jolly old fuck that wouldn't stop smiling. 

“Why sure we do!” He was overly excited by the question. “We need a new maid around here, ours just haven’t been meeting our company's standards.” He was serious, and he meant what he said. He was all about what the company wanted. 

Carl got me all set up to work, gave me a master key, and then sent me off. I went to the first room on the list I was following. I knocked on the door a couple of times and waited for a reply. The frazzled blonde woman from last night opened the door a touch and looked at me, squinting past the morning light. 

“I'm here to clean up your room.” My smile was polite at least, even if my words were grunted. 

“No need, I got it.” She shut the door in my face, and I stood there for a moment before walking away. 

I watched that woman glide into a car on her way out of the front office, her movements too smooth in the early light. I took myself over to her room. I was expecting it to be filled with last night's filth or some confused guy stumbling to the door. Nope. I opened up that room, and it was spotless. Wiped down, vacuumed, and sprayed. I shut the door and shrugged to myself. Never met a tidy hoe, but there is always a first. I went around doing what I needed to do all throughout the day. When night fell, I grabbed my pull-out chair and set it down on the balcony with a twenty-four pack of beer. They were warm, and they had been sitting for a while, but I felt like tonight was the night to bust them open.

Below, the same blonde circled the parking lot with a new man, her path flowing from shadow to neon without a sound. Must be a frequent flyer. I laughed to myself, taking down some more beer. Another one emerged—a brunette done up almost identical to the blonde—escorting a man in some kind of business casual attire, like he was about to inherit the world. As the night deepened, more women appeared, gliding across the lot toward their marks as if drawn by a silent music. Their steps barely touched the asphalt; they vanished into rooms with their men. The blonde I'd seen a few times now, the wig girl, the brunette, another blonde, and a redhead—each one swirling through the night, part of some eerie procession. Their lateness didn't matter. What struck me was how they moved in and out, each arrival and disappearance looking rehearsed, too fluid to be chance.

I ended up drinking myself to sleep in that chair of mine outside my door. I woke up to the sound of revving engines and looked over the banister to witness all five girls coming out of their room in sync with one another, and they each got into their own vehicles. The parade danced away, and I was getting a little curious, but I didn't know if I wanted to dig that deep to know that much about this place. I wanted to be a floater. Floaters don’t notice shit. So why was I out here watching? I've come to expect tidiness from one hoe, but five all in the same motel was wild to me. Spotless. Each room those women stayed in came out the top looking better than when they went in. It was odd, though. I never saw the men leave. What if they never leave? I came to appreciate the motel's nightlife and made it a habit to sit in front of my door and watch what was happening around the place. I'll tell you what I saw: a couple of druggies getting a room to hit up in, I saw an angry-looking guy with no bags, and then I saw those five hoes. All of them went back into the same rooms they had before. I waited all night to watch them leave the next morning, and then I waited to see when the men came out. They never did.

I went to the office and found Carl behind the desk, more chipper than ever, and put together like he was running a million-dollar company. “Hey Carl,” I walked up to him, and his attention snapped to me. For a split second his smile faltered, the crease in his cheek stiffening around his teeth, before he forced it back into place. “What do you know about that group of women that comes around every night?” I guess I did wanna dig a bit into the life of this motel. Find out where the bones were.

“I don't believe I know of whom you speak.” He was genuinely surprised, gaslighting the fuck out of me. 

“Now, Carl,” I leaned up on the counter and flashed him a trusting smile. “We are practically already family with the stay I’ve put into the place. The least you can tell me is what’s going on with those hoes?” I was casually prying the answers from him. 

Carl looked at me and lost his smile. “They work for the company.” He snapped more than he replied, like I was asking too many questions. 

I popped my hands up and backed away, and Carl’s smile didn't return until I was gone. I worked my whole shift thinking about the company. What was the company? Why was Carl so proper with it all while they got hoes working for them? None of this place made sense to me. I stationed myself in my spot, and I watched as three women came. This time, I didn't sit around and wait to see them leave. Instead, I followed one of them to their room. I could get a pretty good view from the window since the curtain inside was slack. As I watched, the couple got down to business, the kind of scene you expect in a place like this. Then something shifted. In the middle of that cheap room, I noticed the hum—this soft, aching whine from the old vending machine in the hallway. It burrowed into my skull, steady and too loud in the silence left behind. My focus bounced between them and that insistent, off-key drone. Suddenly, the woman slid off the bed, reached down, and pulled a butcher's knife from her purse. The vending machine hummed louder, and then came the wet smack of the blade, the thud of the man's arm striking the floor. The tap in the bathroom next door started to drip, each plink echoing in the corridor, time breaking up in these sick little beats. I was so taken aback that I fell backwards into the railing and nearly knocked over a half-empty can rolling on the concrete, its rattle joining the relentless buzz. I got myself up and went to see the next girl. She was in there already, cleaning up the room, the squelch of her sponge scraping out under the same dull vending noise. I went to the next girl, and she was dragging the body into the bathroom, the door screeching shut, and she stayed in there for a really long time before coming back out without a body. All I could hear was that stubborn drip, drip, drip. I snapped myself to my room quickly. I had to collect myself. There was no way that these hoes were killing people. Poor clueless men at that.

That morning, I stood in front of the desk in the office and stared at Carl like I had no scenes. A million thoughts are just racing through my mind. Why was he doing this? Was it the company? What was the company? Who ran the company? Carl lost his smile when he saw me lingering too long, and I got out of there. I went to clean my rooms, almost not bothering with the rooms of the hoes, but my curiosity piqued, and I had to know where those bodies went. I went into the room and locked the door. My hands were sweating, and the smell of bleach hung heavy in the air. I quickly made my way to the bathroom and looked around the small space. Everything was as it should have been. Everything is especially clean. Then I saw a red smudge next to a picture that hung too low on the wall. I pushed it aside and came to a little door. I opened the door and made my way down a dark set of stairs. I had no idea where I was going or what kind of sense I had for doing any of this at all. It wasn't any of my business anyway. When I got to the bottom of the stairs, I ended up in a basement with five doors along the back concrete wall. I stopped for a minute, really questioning whether or not I was gonna do what I thought I was about to do. I stepped forward to one of the doors and fell back in shock. 

The taste of iron exploded on my taste buds, and all I could see was red. There was so much red. It was everywhere. I looked at the cut-open cadaver on the table and at the doctors who loomed around it. I witness so many organs getting boxed up and handed to someone behind another door in the room. I went to bolt out of there when I ran into Carl. 

“I see you have found the product from the company.” He cleared his throat and stared daggers into my soul. 

“I won't tell anyone anything.” My body was shaking at this point, readying myself to fight my way out. 

“I know you won't. Since you have seen what we do, we offer you a choice.” Carl put his hand on my shoulder and flashed me a menacing grin. “You can work for the company.” He smiled broadly with a chipper tone. “Or,” he went on. “We can chop you up and sell your organs to the next highest bidder.” He laughed at the last part. 

“I'll take the job.” Stammering was all I could do. 

“Good! Now remember from this day on, you work for the company, and if you think you can get away, you'd better stop yourself from dreaming now. The company has you by the balls, and all it's gonna do is twist tighter and tighter.” Carl leaned in too close to my face when he spoke, emitting the stench of stale coffee and spearmint. 

“What do I do now?” I was lost. What did it mean to be a part of the company? 

“Just do your job, stay in your room, and mind your own fucking business.” His words were harsh, and he spat out the last of it. 

I nodded my head. I knew my place in all of this. Carl didn't have to threaten me to make me compliant. I know they wouldn't let me get out of here with their secrets. They would kill me before I even reached my car. I went back up the stairs and to my room. I leaned over the balcony and saw the blonde heading up my way. As she bumped into me, I caught her arm. 

“What’s your name”? I thought I might as well get to know these hoes if I was gonna be helping cover up their little operation. 

“Glitter.” She flashed me a smoker's smile and turned back around to follow her new man into her designated room. 

I went back to my room, wondering what her name really was. I sat down on my bed and tried to process everything. I knew I had to get comfortable here. I was definitely a lifer at this point. Floating by was no longer an option for me. I was in it to win it. When I got my first hush-money envelope, I started to really enjoy working for the company. They might have been selling people’s organs, but they pay good as fuck. ",1,1771504599.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

The Trump administration has completed a price floor framework for critical minerals and is actively pitching it to allied governments, as Washington accelerates efforts to reduce Western dependence on China’s grip over resources essential to modern defense, technology, and energy infrastructure.

Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Jacob Helberg confirmed on February 18 that multiple US agencies developed the system and have opened discussions with partners worldwide,[ *Bloomberg* reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-17/us-agencies-have-developed-critical-minerals-price-floor-system). The disclosure arrives two weeks after the administration convened a landmark gathering at the State Department that drew officials from more than 50 nations.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio hosted the February 4 Critical Minerals Ministerial, where Vice President JD Vance introduced the Forum on Resource Geostrategic Engagement (FORGE) — a proposed preferential trade zone anchored by coordinated price floors. “We will establish reference prices for critical minerals at each stage of production,” Vance said. “For members of the preferential zone, these reference prices will operate as a floor maintained through adjustable tariffs to uphold pricing integrity,”[ *CNBC* reported](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/05/us-allies-critical-minerals-price-floors-forge-china-rare-earths-ai-chips-pax-silicchina-.html).

The EU, Japan, and Mexico each reached new agreements with Washington that incorporate the price floor mechanisms, broadening the coalition’s early footprint. FORGE follows an earlier plurilateral initiative called Pax Silica, which focuses specifically on AI-related supply chains,[ the Council on Foreign Relations noted](https://www.cfr.org/articles/u-s-allies-aim-to-break-chinas-critical-minerals-dominance). Across both efforts, the US government has announced more than $30 billion in direct funding commitments tied to critical minerals over the past six months.

The scale of Western vulnerability helps explain the urgency. The US is fully import-dependent for 12 critical minerals and relies on foreign sources for more than half its consumption of 29 others, the Center for Strategic and International Studies found. The [CSIS analysis](https://www.csis.org/analysis/new-executive-order-ties-us-critical-minerals-security-global-partnerships) also notes that Trump signed an executive order on January 15 directing the Commerce Department and the US Trade Representative to pursue bilateral agreements on processed minerals and explore price support mechanisms as a matter of national security.

China controls refining capacity for 19 of 20 minerals essential to clean energy and advanced technology manufacturing — dominance that took decades of strategic investment to build. Washington accuses Beijing of suppressing global mineral prices to undercut competitors before they gain scale, an allegation Vance addressed at the ministerial without naming China directly.

To provide immediate market stability, [Trump launched Project Vault on February 3](https://thedeepdive.ca/trump-launches-project-vault-a-12-billion-minerals-stockpile-to-counter-china/) — a $12 billion stockpile reserve backed by $10 billion from the US Export-Import Bank and $2 billion in private capital — designed to shield domestic manufacturers from cheaper Chinese imports.

But the initiative’s biggest vulnerability may not be China — it may be Washington itself. Coordinated price floors across 50-plus countries and dozens of minerals face untested WTO exposure and enormous implementation complexity. 

More corrosively, the Peterson Institute for International Economics [argues that allies must now factor US geopolitical risk ](https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2026/us-posing-hidden-risk-wests-critical-minerals-strategy)into their supply chain math alongside Chinese risk — a calculation that Trump’s tariff policies and Greenland posturing have made sharper.

# Feb. 18th, 2026~Rare earths surge above price floor given to MP Materials

[Rare earths surge above price floor given to MP Materials](https://www.msn.com/en-us/science/general/rare-earths-surge-above-price-floor-given-to-mp-materials/ar-AA1WBDDK?ocid=BingNewsSerp)

[FILE PHOTO: Wheel loaders fill trucks with ore at the MP Materials rare earth mine in Mountain Pass, California, U.S. January 30, 2020. REUTERS\/Steve Marcus\/File Photo](https://preview.redd.it/3gnifom1zfkg1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=046da6fcf04c54c64f6eaaf00722249af5c58b48)

LONDON, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Prices of two key rare earths, crucial for making super-strong magnets used in EVs and defence equipment, have rallied on firm demand and bottlenecks in supply, above a ground-breaking price floor provided by the U.S. last year to miner MP Materials.

The near doubling of prices over seven months means the U.S. government will not have to subsidise MP Materials' output of neodymium and praseodymium (NdPr) as long as it remains above the threshold of $110 per kg.

The rally in prices to $123 a kg, the highest since July 2022, will also boost other rare earth companies that Western governments hope will be able to cut reliance on top producer China.

China dominates the global supply chain for rare earths, accounting for 90% of refining capacity and around 70% of mined output.

""The price rally has been driven by firm downstream magnet demand and deliberate supply management in China,"" said Neha Mukherjee, research manager for rare earths at consultancy Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.

She cautioned that the elevated prices are likely to be temporary, with a downward correction expected by the end of March.

The Chinese price of NdPr oxide, regarded as a benchmark, has jumped to 850,000 yuan per metric ton or $123 per kg, from $63 on July 9, when MP Materials unveiled its multibillion-dollar deal with the U.S.

NdPr prices have been weighed down by oversupply in recent years, and in March last year, they sank to 345,000 yuan, the weakest since November 2020.

""While many operations can sustain output at today's elevated prices, the current market tightness is short term and does not reflect underlying market fundamentals,"" Mukherjee added.

As part of the ground-breaking deal with MP, the Pentagon offered price support to MP for the NdPr it produces, based on $110 per kg to help it better compete with China.

The U.S. government also stipulated that the company halt shipments of its mined output to China after the material had fed 7%-9% of China's NdPr oxide production over the previous three years, according to consultancy Adamas.

The cut-off of supply from MP coincided with tightened supply in China due to what analysts regarded as lower rare earth mining and smelting quotas, although the government did not make a public statement about the quotas.

# Feb. 18th, 2026~US and Uzbekistan sign critical minerals pact

[US and Uzbekistan sign critical minerals pact | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-uzbekistan-sign-critical-minerals-pact-2026-02-18/)

[U.S. President Donald Trump shakes hands with Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev as they meet during the 80th United Nations General Assembly, in New York City](https://preview.redd.it/pddvaeyc3gkg1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ad885130c00a515798aa047774621bc23c869f9)

LONDON, Feb 18 (Reuters) - The U.S. government has signed an agreement with Uzbekistan to secure better access to the Central Asian country's critical minerals, as U.S. President Donald Trump moves to counter China's dominance of crucial resources and their supply chains.

The ""Joint Investment Framework"" between the U.S. International Development Finance Corp (DFC) and Central Asia's most populous nation aims to advance the two countries' strategic cooperation, an outline of the plan from the DFC said.

It will prioritise investments across the critical mineral value chain including exploration, extraction and processing, and proposes a new U.S.–Uzbekistan Joint Investment Holding Company for future minerals and infrastructure projects, the DFC's plan said.

Uzbekistan's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Since Donald Trump's return to power, the U.S. has courted the five former Soviet republics of Central Asia and moved to bolster its influence in a region where Russia and China have traditionally enjoyed primacy.

Trump hosted his Uzbek counterpart, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, alongside the leaders of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan at the White House in November, and earlier this month held a minerals summit that resulted in initial Memorandums of Understanding on critical mineral supplies with 11 countries, including Uzbekistan.

Uzbekistan, Central Asia's second-largest economy, has been pursuing a programme of economic reform since Mirziyoyev - who was in Washington on Wednesday for the inaugural meeting of Trump's ['Board of Peace'](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/white-house-planning-leaders-meeting-gaza-board-peace-feb-19-axios-reports-2026-02-07/) that he has joined - took office in 2016.

The country of almost 40 million has significant reserves of gold, uranium and copper, as well as significant untapped reserves of dozens of critical minerals such as lithium and tungsten that sit at the heart of modern technology.

The agreement with Uzbekistan also highlights the DFC's growing role in Trump's strategy.

# NioCorp: The Strategic Basket

NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project isn’t just another mine — it’s a **national industrial base reset button**. With the U.S. defense and aerospace sector exposed to foreign choke points, Elk Creek’s mix of critical minerals lines up squarely with Pentagon and DOE priorities.

# 🔑 The Mineral Arsenal

* **Niobium (Nb)** – The *quiet giant*. From jet engines to superconductors, SMRs, and quantum systems, niobium is the alloy enabler. Elk Creek could supply a good portion — potentially all — of U.S. needs, ending dependence on Brazil.
* **Titanium (Ti & TiCl₄)** – Backbone of airframes, missiles, and armor plating. TiCl₄ doubles as a coatings precursor and is integral to stealth systems and chemical defense. A secure U.S. feedstock is essential.
* **Scandium (Sc & Sc-Al alloys)** – *The game-changer. Sc-Al alloys cut aircraft weight, extend combat radius, and enable Gen VI fighter designs. First scandium metal is targeted for November, with a DoD prime already working alongside NioCorp.*
* **Rare Earths (Nd/Pr, Dy, Tb)** – The permanent magnet core for F-35s, drones, EVs, and Navy ships. *Without them, electrification and defense propulsion grind to a halt. Elk Creek adds a U.S. stream for the most critical magnet REEs.*

[Given: Sc-Al alloy isn’t a science project anymore — it’s a DoD + Prime-level requirement if the U.S. is serious about next-gen airframes, range extension, weight reduction, and high-performance systems. If scandium gets swept into price floors or stockpile logic like the 2025 Rio\/DLA-style deal level, Elk Creek becomes bankable overnight.](https://reddit.com/link/1r8y322/video/mtfvsb1s2gkg1/player)

We are watching as the U.S. is actively building a Western **critical minerals bloc**, and allied nations are now committing real capital into U.S. energy + critical mineral buildouts while U.S. agencies openly discuss **price floors / price-support frameworks** to stop China from dumping markets and crushing Western miners. This is the missing mechanism the sector has needed for 20+ years — **stable pricing + guaranteed demand** so projects can actually get financed, built, and scaled. Now overlay **Project VAULT** (EXIM-backed stockpile logic), **FORGE** (allied coordination), and a U.S.-led pricing framework, and you’re basically watching America reboot the **1950s titanium playbook** — except this time the target is a whole defense stack: **Scandium + Niobium + Titanium + REEs (Tb/Dy) + more**, not just one metal. The mission is no longer “cheap supply.” The mission is **secure supply**, even if it costs more — because defense now outranks price.

[AS MORE DUMP TRUCKS & EQUIPMENT APPEAR ONSITE AT THE ELK CREEK MINE DUAL PORTAL RAMP DIG! \(\*Photo shared from Todd & Mr N. from Elk Creek site.\)](https://preview.redd.it/vkb1nk8p3gkg1.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=245f4dfeec8c8480f42ae3496ca172156f6f5660)

And since we’ve all been following the story… this isn’t “hope” anymore — it’s a **sequenced catalyst stack**: **March 2026 DFS**, the **ScAl alloy / DoD track advancing**, **offtakes + price-support frameworks**, and then **mid-2026 EXIM/FID** as the financing unlock once the last boxes are checked. NioCorp isn’t pitching a one-metal mine — it’s a **Seven Critical Mineral platform** (Nb + Sc + Ti + REEs with the exact heavies the Pentagon keeps flagging, like **Tb/Dy**).

That’s why Mark Smith keeps calling Elk Creek **“a National Strategic Asset,”** and why he’s already said **“YES, we are in talks with the Department of Defense right now.”** In a world shifting toward **Project VAULT, FORGE, allied capital, and price supports**, this is starting to look less like a junior miner and more like a **strategic industrial buildout** — the modern version of the 1950s titanium playbook, except this time the metals that matter IMHO are **Scandium + Niobium + Titanium + REE heavies.**

[NioCorp is Engaged & Rolling.. \\""The Elk Creek story is about to hit the catalyst stack like a freight train...All Aboard!!\\""](https://reddit.com/link/1r8y322/video/eujyhw024gkg1/player)

And with **more equipment and dump trucks now showing up on site** as ramp/portal work continues, the ground truth is simple: **the build is quietly beginning — and by 2028–2029, the question won’t be “does Elk Creek get built?”… it’ll be who got positioned early before the supply chain doors closed. 🔥🚂**

Waiting for more material news as it becomes available with many!

1r8y2x3,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1r8y2x3/the_hoe_in_hotel/,The Hoe in Hotel,"A crushed pack of Pall Malls balanced on the dashboard as I drove through the dark with everything I owned rattling behind me in cardboard boxes. The ashtray overflowed. My mother’s station wagon groaned on every lane change, seat ripped open, glue stains on the floor, and the whole car stinking of cigarettes and motel soap. My whole life fit inside this car, a rolling, rusted coffin parked now beneath the blinding lights of a gas station. I stepped out, the door screaming on its hinges, and walked under the neon wash, following the squeak of my sneakers through the cool air and tang of bleach. I picked up some snacks and headed for the register.

“Pall Mall Blue, shorts.” I pointed at the carton behind the young man. 

Even when I pointed it out, he stared right past it. Silence. I leaned over the counter and grabbed a pack myself. “Any good motels around here?” He just blinked. Another pause. The young man took a long time ringing up the few items I held.

“Down the road. You’ll come up on it. It’s on the left-hand side. It’s the Beaver Town Motel, you can't miss it.” The boy finished up his scan, and I took all my shit and got out of there. 

I put some gas in the tank before heading out to find the motel the boy was talking about. Hopefully, it was somewhat decent. I needed a place to bunker down for a while, cause it was taking me a while to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. Sure enough, I saw it, hanging on the left-hand side with a big ole neon sign showing off two open legs, one on the side of the B for beaver, and the other leg was spread open to the N in town. I pulled into the mostly deserted parking lot and took a look around before getting out of my car. I hated that druggies came begging for money as soon as you pulled up somewhere. I can't even pay for myself, how do they think I'm gonna pay for their drugs? The parking lot was still, with garbage strewn around the worn-out asphalt, and all I could hear were muffled conversations happening somewhere around where I was parked. I got out of my car, locked it up, and made my way to the front office. The door chimed open, and the overbearing fluorescent lights caught me off guard. I walked up to a young woman sitting behind the counter, her nose stuck to her phone. 

“I need a room here for a while.” I walked up and put my hands down on the desk to draw her attention. 

“What's a while”? She didn't even look up from her phone. 

“I don't know for four or five days.” I wasn't sure at that moment how long I would have to stay here until I hopped to my next destination. 

“You’re a lifer.” The girl muttered under her breath as she put her phone down and sat up. 

“I am a what?” I cocked my head over and put my ear closer to where she was standing. 

“You’re a lifer.” A snark came out, and she sighed. “There are lifers, and there are floaters. You're gonna ground yourself in here for a while. Try to make sense of things? Yeah. You're not going anywhere for a long while.” She let out a laugh and typed around on the computer. 

“You can have room 2G, it's a real den of a place.” She was being sarcastic. My fingers tapped out a quick staccato on the counter, my jaw tightening. I had no patience left for underdeveloped teenagers barely looking up from their phones.

“Thanks.” I took my key card and walked out of the office back into the moist night air. 

I found the old concrete steps that led up to the second floor, my hand rubbing over rusted patches of metal from the hand guard. I found my room and opened it up. Home sweet home. I was happy to at least afford a king-size bed. I pulled back the blankets covering the mattress and looked down at the yellow- and brown-stained white sheets. I pulled everything off the bed and threw it aside before going back to my car and getting some of my bags. On my way back up to my room, I noticed a woman, all done up, really scrawny, who was struggling to walk in her stilts next to some older guy who was noble enough to wear a suit. I said good evening as I passed and continued on my way to my destination. I put my own sheets and blankets over the other side of the decent mattress and even brought in my own pillows. I set myself up really nicely in this room before I called it and went to bed. The next morning, I got up and trudged down to the office to look into getting a job. The young girl at the counter was gone, and in her place was a jolly old fuck that wouldn't stop smiling. 

“Why sure we do!” He was overly excited by the question. “We need a new maid around here, ours just haven’t been meeting our company's standards.” He was serious, and he meant what he said. He was all about what the company wanted. 

Carl got me all set up to work, gave me a master key, and then sent me off. I went to the first room on the list I was following. I knocked on the door a couple of times and waited for a reply. The frazzled blonde woman from last night opened the door a touch and looked at me, squinting past the morning light. 

“I'm here to clean up your room.” My smile was polite at least, even if my words were grunted. 

“No need, I got it.” She shut the door in my face, and I stood there for a moment before walking away. 

I watched that woman glide into a car on her way out of the front office, her movements too smooth in the early light. I took myself over to her room. I was expecting it to be filled with last night's filth or some confused guy stumbling to the door. Nope. I opened up that room, and it was spotless. Wiped down, vacuumed, and sprayed. I shut the door and shrugged to myself. Never met a tidy hoe, but there is always a first. I went around doing what I needed to do all throughout the day. When night fell, I grabbed my pull-out chair and set it down on the balcony with a twenty-four pack of beer. They were warm, and they had been sitting for a while, but I felt like tonight was the night to bust them open.

Below, the same blonde circled the parking lot with a new man, her path flowing from shadow to neon without a sound. Must be a frequent flyer. I laughed to myself, taking down some more beer. Another one emerged—a brunette done up almost identical to the blonde—escorting a man in some kind of business casual attire, like he was about to inherit the world. As the night deepened, more women appeared, gliding across the lot toward their marks as if drawn by a silent music. Their steps barely touched the asphalt; they vanished into rooms with their men. The blonde I'd seen a few times now, the wig girl, the brunette, another blonde, and a redhead—each one swirling through the night, part of some eerie procession. Their lateness didn't matter. What struck me was how they moved in and out, each arrival and disappearance looking rehearsed, too fluid to be chance.

I ended up drinking myself to sleep in that chair of mine outside my door. I woke up to the sound of revving engines and looked over the banister to witness all five girls coming out of their room in sync with one another, and they each got into their own vehicles. The parade danced away, and I was getting a little curious, but I didn't know if I wanted to dig that deep to know that much about this place. I wanted to be a floater. Floaters don’t notice shit. So why was I out here watching? I've come to expect tidiness from one hoe, but five all in the same motel was wild to me. Spotless. Each room those women stayed in came out the top looking better than when they went in. It was odd, though. I never saw the men leave. What if they never leave? I came to appreciate the motel's nightlife and made it a habit to sit in front of my door and watch what was happening around the place. I'll tell you what I saw: a couple of druggies getting a room to hit up in, I saw an angry-looking guy with no bags, and then I saw those five hoes. All of them went back into the same rooms they had before. I waited all night to watch them leave the next morning, and then I waited to see when the men came out. They never did.

I went to the office and found Carl behind the desk, more chipper than ever, and put together like he was running a million-dollar company. “Hey Carl,” I walked up to him, and his attention snapped to me. For a split second his smile faltered, the crease in his cheek stiffening around his teeth, before he forced it back into place. “What do you know about that group of women that comes around every night?” I guess I did wanna dig a bit into the life of this motel. Find out where the bones were.

“I don't believe I know of whom you speak.” He was genuinely surprised, gaslighting the fuck out of me. 

“Now, Carl,” I leaned up on the counter and flashed him a trusting smile. “We are practically already family with the stay I’ve put into the place. The least you can tell me is what’s going on with those hoes?” I was casually prying the answers from him. 

Carl looked at me and lost his smile. “They work for the company.” He snapped more than he replied, like I was asking too many questions. 

I popped my hands up and backed away, and Carl’s smile didn't return until I was gone. I worked my whole shift thinking about the company. What was the company? Why was Carl so proper with it all while they got hoes working for them? None of this place made sense to me. I stationed myself in my spot, and I watched as three women came. This time, I didn't sit around and wait to see them leave. Instead, I followed one of them to their room. I could get a pretty good view from the window since the curtain inside was slack. As I watched, the couple got down to business, the kind of scene you expect in a place like this. Then something shifted. In the middle of that cheap room, I noticed the hum—this soft, aching whine from the old vending machine in the hallway. It burrowed into my skull, steady and too loud in the silence left behind. My focus bounced between them and that insistent, off-key drone. Suddenly, the woman slid off the bed, reached down, and pulled a butcher's knife from her purse. The vending machine hummed louder, and then came the wet smack of the blade, the thud of the man's arm striking the floor. The tap in the bathroom next door started to drip, each plink echoing in the corridor, time breaking up in these sick little beats. I was so taken aback that I fell backwards into the railing and nearly knocked over a half-empty can rolling on the concrete, its rattle joining the relentless buzz. I got myself up and went to see the next girl. She was in there already, cleaning up the room, the squelch of her sponge scraping out under the same dull vending noise. I went to the next girl, and she was dragging the body into the bathroom, the door screeching shut, and she stayed in there for a really long time before coming back out without a body. All I could hear was that stubborn drip, drip, drip. I snapped myself to my room quickly. I had to collect myself. There was no way that these hoes were killing people. Poor clueless men at that.

That morning, I stood in front of the desk in the office and stared at Carl like I had no scenes. A million thoughts are just racing through my mind. Why was he doing this? Was it the company? What was the company? Who ran the company? Carl lost his smile when he saw me lingering too long, and I got out of there. I went to clean my rooms, almost not bothering with the rooms of the hoes, but my curiosity piqued, and I had to know where those bodies went. I went into the room and locked the door. My hands were sweating, and the smell of bleach hung heavy in the air. I quickly made my way to the bathroom and looked around the small space. Everything was as it should have been. Everything is especially clean. Then I saw a red smudge next to a picture that hung too low on the wall. I pushed it aside and came to a little door. I opened the door and made my way down a dark set of stairs. I had no idea where I was going or what kind of sense I had for doing any of this at all. It wasn't any of my business anyway. When I got to the bottom of the stairs, I ended up in a basement with five doors along the back concrete wall. I stopped for a minute, really questioning whether or not I was gonna do what I thought I was about to do. I stepped forward to one of the doors and fell back in shock. 

The taste of iron exploded on my taste buds, and all I could see was red. There was so much red. It was everywhere. I looked at the cut-open cadaver on the table and at the doctors who loomed around it. I witness so many organs getting boxed up and handed to someone behind another door in the room. I went to bolt out of there when I ran into Carl. 

“I see you have found the product from the company.” He cleared his throat and stared daggers into my soul. 

“I won't tell anyone anything.” My body was shaking at this point, readying myself to fight my way out. 

“I know you won't. Since you have seen what we do, we offer you a choice.” Carl put his hand on my shoulder and flashed me a menacing grin. “You can work for the company.” He smiled broadly with a chipper tone. “Or,” he went on. “We can chop you up and sell your organs to the next highest bidder.” He laughed at the last part. 

“I'll take the job.” Stammering was all I could do. 

“Good! Now remember from this day on, you work for the company, and if you think you can get away, you'd better stop yourself from dreaming now. The company has you by the balls, and all it's gonna do is twist tighter and tighter.” Carl leaned in too close to my face when he spoke, emitting the stench of stale coffee and spearmint. 

“What do I do now?” I was lost. What did it mean to be a part of the company? 

“Just do your job, stay in your room, and mind your own fucking business.” His words were harsh, and he spat out the last of it. 

I nodded my head. I knew my place in all of this. Carl didn't have to threaten me to make me compliant. I know they wouldn't let me get out of here with their secrets. They would kill me before I even reached my car. I went back up the stairs and to my room. I leaned over the balcony and saw the blonde heading up my way. As she bumped into me, I caught her arm. 

“What’s your name”? I thought I might as well get to know these hoes if I was gonna be helping cover up their little operation. 

“Glitter.” She flashed me a smoker's smile and turned back around to follow her new man into her designated room. 

I went back to my room, wondering what her name really was. I sat down on my bed and tried to process everything. I knew I had to get comfortable here. I was definitely a lifer at this point. Floating by was no longer an option for me. I was in it to win it. When I got my first hush-money envelope, I started to really enjoy working for the company. They might have been selling people’s organs, but they pay good as fuck. ",1,1771504580.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

My girlfriend however has two she has an emotional connection with the oldest cat. 

We moved to her hometown recently a town I've never been to. She tells me hey we have to get my two cats from my mother's when we get a place. She knows I'm not really into cats but she expressed that they were good cats.

We get our new apartment it's under my name we move in our things and finally get the cats.

...and that's when hell started. They immediately started hiding in the cabinets, sleeping in the cabinets in the kitchen, meowing loud at night, meowing near our bedroom doom just to be let in THEN leave, scratching the walls, laying on freshly clean clothes (cat hair is not my thing), jumping into the windows despite me playing flower pots in the window, running into the bathroom when we go in just to jump on the toilet or sink then leave, chewing my coffee table. My counter has been water spray, foil in cabinets, and trying to clicker train them.

I'm all for compromise and learning to live with a situation but I cannot reward bad behavior. My girlfriend states she doesn't know why they've been doing this and that she'll retrain them. 

It's hard to not feel a little irritated around them I made a post detailing this in another thread but they basically told me I was the problem and that cats will be cats regardless.",1,1771504561.0,catfree,0,1.0,False

So why was I out here watching? I've come to expect tidiness from one hoe, but five all in the same motel was wild to me. Spotless. Each room those women stayed in came out the top looking better than when they went in. It was odd, though. I never saw the men leave. What if they never leave? I came to appreciate the motel's nightlife and made it a habit to sit in front of my door and watch what was happening around the place. I'll tell you what I saw: a couple of druggies getting a room to hit up in, I saw an angry-looking guy with no bags, and then I saw those five hoes. All of them went back into the same rooms they had before. I waited all night to watch them leave the next morning, and then I waited to see when the men came out. They never did.

I went to the office and found Carl behind the desk, more chipper than ever, and put together like he was running a million-dollar company. “Hey Carl,” I walked up to him, and his attention snapped to me. For a split second his smile faltered, the crease in his cheek stiffening around his teeth, before he forced it back into place. “What do you know about that group of women that comes around every night?” I guess I did wanna dig a bit into the life of this motel. Find out where the bones were.

“I don't believe I know of whom you speak.” He was genuinely surprised, gaslighting the fuck out of me. 

“Now, Carl,” I leaned up on the counter and flashed him a trusting smile. “We are practically already family with the stay I’ve put into the place. The least you can tell me is what’s going on with those hoes?” I was casually prying the answers from him. 

Carl looked at me and lost his smile. “They work for the company.” He snapped more than he replied, like I was asking too many questions. 

I popped my hands up and backed away, and Carl’s smile didn't return until I was gone. I worked my whole shift thinking about the company. What was the company? Why was Carl so proper with it all while they got hoes working for them? None of this place made sense to me. I stationed myself in my spot, and I watched as three women came. This time, I didn't sit around and wait to see them leave. Instead, I followed one of them to their room. I could get a pretty good view from the window since the curtain inside was slack. As I watched, the couple got down to business, the kind of scene you expect in a place like this. Then something shifted. In the middle of that cheap room, I noticed the hum—this soft, aching whine from the old vending machine in the hallway. It burrowed into my skull, steady and too loud in the silence left behind. My focus bounced between them and that insistent, off-key drone. Suddenly, the woman slid off the bed, reached down, and pulled a butcher's knife from her purse. The vending machine hummed louder, and then came the wet smack of the blade, the thud of the man's arm striking the floor. The tap in the bathroom next door started to drip, each plink echoing in the corridor, time breaking up in these sick little beats. I was so taken aback that I fell backwards into the railing and nearly knocked over a half-empty can rolling on the concrete, its rattle joining the relentless buzz. I got myself up and went to see the next girl. She was in there already, cleaning up the room, the squelch of her sponge scraping out under the same dull vending noise. I went to the next girl, and she was dragging the body into the bathroom, the door screeching shut, and she stayed in there for a really long time before coming back out without a body. All I could hear was that stubborn drip, drip, drip. I snapped myself to my room quickly. I had to collect myself. There was no way that these hoes were killing people. Poor clueless men at that.

That morning, I stood in front of the desk in the office and stared at Carl like I had no scenes. A million thoughts are just racing through my mind. Why was he doing this? Was it the company? What was the company? Who ran the company? Carl lost his smile when he saw me lingering too long, and I got out of there. I went to clean my rooms, almost not bothering with the rooms of the hoes, but my curiosity piqued, and I had to know where those bodies went. I went into the room and locked the door. My hands were sweating, and the smell of bleach hung heavy in the air. I quickly made my way to the bathroom and looked around the small space. Everything was as it should have been. Everything is especially clean. Then I saw a red smudge next to a picture that hung too low on the wall. I pushed it aside and came to a little door. I opened the door and made my way down a dark set of stairs. I had no idea where I was going or what kind of sense I had for doing any of this at all. It wasn't any of my business anyway. When I got to the bottom of the stairs, I ended up in a basement with five doors along the back concrete wall. I stopped for a minute, really questioning whether or not I was gonna do what I thought I was about to do. I stepped forward to one of the doors and fell back in shock. 

The taste of iron exploded on my taste buds, and all I could see was red. There was so much red. It was everywhere. I looked at the cut-open cadaver on the table and at the doctors who loomed around it. I witness so many organs getting boxed up and handed to someone behind another door in the room. I went to bolt out of there when I ran into Carl. 

“I see you have found the product from the company.” He cleared his throat and stared daggers into my soul. 

“I won't tell anyone anything.” My body was shaking at this point, readying myself to fight my way out. 

“I know you won't. Since you have seen what we do, we offer you a choice.” Carl put his hand on my shoulder and flashed me a menacing grin. “You can work for the company.” He smiled broadly with a chipper tone. “Or,” he went on. “We can chop you up and sell your organs to the next highest bidder.” He laughed at the last part. 

“I'll take the job.” Stammering was all I could do. 

“Good! Now remember from this day on, you work for the company, and if you think you can get away, you'd better stop yourself from dreaming now. The company has you by the balls, and all it's gonna do is twist tighter and tighter.” Carl leaned in too close to my face when he spoke, emitting the stench of stale coffee and spearmint. 

“What do I do now?” I was lost. What did it mean to be a part of the company? 

“Just do your job, stay in your room, and mind your own fucking business.” His words were harsh, and he spat out the last of it. 

I nodded my head. I knew my place in all of this. Carl didn't have to threaten me to make me compliant. I know they wouldn't let me get out of here with their secrets. They would kill me before I even reached my car. I went back up the stairs and to my room. I leaned over the balcony and saw the blonde heading up my way. As she bumped into me, I caught her arm. 

“What’s your name”? I thought I might as well get to know these hoes if I was gonna be helping cover up their little operation. 

“Glitter.” She flashed me a smoker's smile and turned back around to follow her new man into her designated room. 

I went back to my room, wondering what her name really was. I sat down on my bed and tried to process everything. I knew I had to get comfortable here. I was definitely a lifer at this point. Floating by was no longer an option for me. I was in it to win it. When I got my first hush-money envelope, I started to really enjoy working for the company. They might have been selling people’s organs, but they pay good as fuck. ",1,1771504558.0,Nonsleep,0,1.0,False

1r8y1ow,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowEarnMoneyOnline/comments/1r8y1ow/nuggmi_online_mining_simulator_little_extra_money/,NUGGMI - Online Mining Simulator - Little extra money,"Hey everyone,

I recently stumbled across a brand-new faucet/mining-style platform called **Nuggmi**, and since it’s still very early, I figured it might be worth sharing.

The concept is pretty straightforward:

You purchase tools → the tools automatically generate nuggets over time → you collect the nuggets → upgrade and repeat.

Those nuggets can then be converted and withdrawn as crypto (BTC, ETH, SOL, USDT, etc.).

It just launched recently and still feels like it’s in its early growth phase, which can sometimes be the best time to try something like this. I actually found it randomly while browsing ads, and it brought back that old-school faucet vibe that’s hard to find nowadays.

**So far, here’s what stands out:**

* Simple, clean interface (no annoying pop-up overload)
* Progression feels reasonable, not painfully slow
* No aggressive push to deposit money
* Includes PTC ads, tasks, and the mining system
* Offerwalls and surveys are supposedly coming soon

Of course, it’s too early to judge long-term sustainability. The real test will be how competitive the offerwalls and rewards turn out to be once everything is fully implemented.

I’m planning to test it for a few weeks and see how it develops. Not saying it’s a guaranteed win — just sharing something new that might turn into a decent side earner.

Is it life-changing money? Definitely not. More like small side earnings — think coffee money, not rent money. Keep expectations realistic.

There’s currently a 1000 nugget ($0.10) signup bonus.

If you want to check it out:

Referral link (I earn a small bonus when you collect or watch ads):

Curious to hear if anyone else gives it a try.

Here is also a post of my first depositI hope to regain in 1 month.  You can play without putting any money, just trying to find if it's faster this way.

1r8y1j9,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1r8y1j9/i_deleted_every_comfort_in_my_life_for_60_days/,I deleted every comfort in my life for 60 days and became unrecognizable,"I realized I was optimizing my entire life for comfort and it was destroying me.

Everything in my apartment was designed to make things easier. Food delivered to my door so I didn’t have to leave. Entertainment one click away so I never got bored. Work from home so I never had to go anywhere. My whole life was frictionless and I thought that was good.

I’m 26. For the past two years I’d been removing every bit of difficulty from my existence. Didn’t want to cook so I ordered every meal. Didn’t want to be bored so I had infinite content at my fingertips. Didn’t want to feel uncomfortable so I never did anything that required effort.

My life was easy and I was completely miserable.

I had no discipline because I never had to exercise it. No resilience because I never faced difficulty. No growth because I never pushed myself. Just endless comfort that felt good moment to moment but left me empty and weak.

I’d wake up, work from my bed, order lunch, watch stuff, order dinner, consume content until I fell asleep. Repeat daily. Zero resistance anywhere in my life. Zero challenge. Zero growth.

Two months ago I was lying in bed at 3pm on a Saturday scrolling my phone with food wrappers around me and I realized I’d become completely soft. Not just physically but mentally. I couldn’t handle any discomfort at all. The smallest inconvenience felt unbearable because my entire life was engineered to avoid it.

That’s when I decided to do the opposite. Remove every comfort. Add friction everywhere. Make everything harder. Force myself to build the discipline and resilience I’d completely lost.

What I actually did

Removed all convenience from my life

First thing I did was delete every app that made life easy. Food delivery apps gone. All of them. DoorDash, Uber Eats, everything. If I wanted food I’d have to go get it or cook it.

Streaming services deleted. Netflix, YouTube, all of it. If I wanted entertainment I’d have to actually go somewhere or do something that required effort.

Got rid of my car for the 60 days. Gave the keys to a friend. If I needed to go somewhere I’d walk or take public transit. No more driving two minutes to avoid a ten minute walk.

Added mandatory daily discomfort

Every single day I had to do something uncomfortable. Not dangerous, just uncomfortable. Cold showers every morning. Going to the gym even when I didn’t feel like it. Talking to strangers. Anything that made me want to avoid it.

Used this app called Reload to structure the whole thing. It built me a 60 day plan with increasing challenges each week. Week one challenges were small discomforts. Week eight challenges were things that genuinely scared me.

Also used it to block everything that let me take the easy path. Blocked food delivery sites, blocked all streaming and social media. Made comfort impossible so I had to face discomfort.

Forced myself to do everything the hard way

Needed groceries? Walk 20 minutes to the store, carry them back. No quick drive.

Wanted coffee? Walk to a coffee shop, order in person, talk to the barista. No mobile order pickup.

Needed to contact someone? Call them, have an actual conversation. No hiding behind text.

Every single thing became harder and that was the point. Build back the ability to handle difficulty.

Week 1 I almost quit immediately

First week was brutal. My brain was used to having everything instantly and easily. Now everything required effort and discomfort.

Day 1 I wanted lunch. Normally I’d order it. Now I had to either cook or walk 15 minutes to get something. Felt exhausting just thinking about it. Almost gave up and ordered anyway but the apps were deleted.

Walked to get food. Felt annoyed and uncomfortable the whole time. Got back and realized I’d just done something that used to feel impossible.

Day 3 took my first cold shower. Stood there dreading it for five minutes. Finally did it. Lasted maybe 20 seconds before I gave up. Felt like I’d accomplished something just for trying.

Day 5 had to take the bus somewhere. Hadn’t used public transit in over a year. Felt anxious and out of place. Did it anyway because driving wasn’t an option.

Day 7 I sat in my apartment at night with nothing to do. No streaming services to watch. No easy entertainment. Just boredom. It was uncomfortable. Ended up reading a book because there was nothing else.

Week one sucked but I didn’t quit. Every discomfort I pushed through proved I was stronger than I thought.

Week 2 to 3 discomfort became manageable

Weeks two and three the daily challenges continued but started feeling less impossible.

Cold showers went from 20 seconds to a full minute. Still hated them but I could handle it. Walking everywhere stopped feeling like a burden and just became normal.

Day 10 I talked to someone in line at the coffee shop. Felt awkward but I did it. Small conversation about nothing. Before this I would’ve avoided any interaction.

Day 15 the plan increased the challenges. Week three required working out six days instead of four. Required cooking all meals instead of allowing some takeout. Required one genuinely uncomfortable social interaction daily.

Day 18 I went to a climbing gym alone knowing nobody. Felt terrified walking in. Did it anyway. Left feeling proud for facing something that scared me.

Week three I cooked every single meal. No exceptions. Went grocery shopping twice, walked both times carrying bags. My legs got stronger, my discipline got stronger.

Day 21 I realized I hadn’t watched any streaming content in three weeks. Hadn’t ordered food in three weeks. Hadn’t taken the easy path once. I was doing things I would’ve said were impossible a month ago.

Week 4 to 6 I started seeking discomfort

Weeks four through six something shifted. I stopped dreading the discomfort and started wanting it.

Cold showers became something I looked forward to. Proof every morning that I could do hard things. Walking everywhere meant I was outside, moving, present instead of isolated in my car.

Day 28 I did a full two minute cold shower without wanting to quit. A month ago twenty seconds felt unbearable.

Week five challenges increased again. Required taking the harder path even when easier options existed. Required seeking out uncomfortable situations instead of just not avoiding them.

Day 35 I went to a social meetup for something I was interested in. Went alone. Talked to people I didn’t know. Would’ve been impossible two months ago. Now it was just another challenge to face.

I was cooking elaborate meals because cooking became meditative. Was walking over an hour daily because it gave me time to think. Working out became non negotiable because it was proof I had discipline.

Day 40 I looked back at week one when walking fifteen minutes for food felt exhausting. Now I’d walk an hour without thinking about it. My capacity for discomfort had expanded completely.

Week 7 to 8 complete transformation

Last two weeks I was unrecognizable from who I started as.

Cold showers were easy. Three minutes of cold water felt like nothing. I was actively seeking harder challenges because easy ones weren’t enough anymore.

Day 50 I did something that terrified me. Went to an open mic and told a story in front of strangers. Bombed completely. Didn’t care. Did the thing that scared me and survived.

Week eight challenges were the hardest. Fasting for 24 hours. Having difficult conversations I’d been avoiding. Doing things that made me genuinely uncomfortable. I did all of them.

I’d walked over 200 miles total during the 60 days. Cooked every single meal. Took cold showers every morning. Faced dozens of uncomfortable situations. Built discipline I didn’t know I was capable of.

Day 60 I sat in my apartment and realized I was a completely different person. Two months ago the smallest discomfort felt unbearable. Now I could handle almost anything.

What actually changed in 60 days

I built real discipline

Went from unable to handle any discomfort to actively seeking it out. My capacity for doing hard things expanded completely.

My mental resilience transformed

Small inconveniences that used to ruin my day became nothing. I could handle setbacks and difficulty without falling apart.

My physical health improved dramatically

Lost 18 pounds from walking everywhere and working out consistently. Got visibly stronger. Had energy I hadn’t felt in years.

I stopped being controlled by comfort

Used to organize my entire life around avoiding discomfort. Now discomfort was just part of life and I could handle it.

I proved I was capable of way more than I thought

Spent years thinking I was just weak. Turns out I’d made myself weak by removing all challenge from my life.

I became present in my life

Walking everywhere meant I was outside experiencing the world. Cooking meant I was engaged in the process. No more hiding behind screens and delivery apps.

What I learned about comfort

Comfort is a trap. Feels good short term but destroys you long term.

The more you optimize for comfort the less capable you become of handling difficulty. Your capacity for discomfort shrinks until everything feels hard.

Modern life makes it easy to remove all friction. That ease destroys discipline, resilience, growth, everything that makes you strong.

You need regular discomfort to maintain your ability to handle life. Without it you become fragile and weak.

Seeking discomfort sounds terrible but it’s the only way to build real strength. Not just physical, mental and emotional strength.

If you’ve made your life too comfortable

Look at where you’ve optimized everything for ease. Food delivery, endless entertainment, avoiding all inconvenience. Those comforts are making you weak.

Remove one major convenience for one week. Delete food delivery apps and cook or walk to get food. See how it feels to add friction back.

Add one daily discomfort. Cold showers, working out when you don’t feel like it, having conversations that feel awkward. Build the habit of doing hard things.

Use tools that enforce it. I used Reload to block all the easy paths and build a progressive plan of increasing challenges. Made backsliding impossible.

Start small but increase weekly. Week one discomforts should be manageable. Week eight discomforts should genuinely challenge you.

Track your capacity growing. Notice how things that felt impossible become easy. How your threshold for difficulty expands.

Give it 60 days minimum. First two weeks suck. Week four you start adapting. Week eight you’re unrecognizable.

Final thought

Two months ago I was completely soft. Optimized my entire life for comfort and convenience and became weak and miserable.

Now I’m strong. Physically, mentally, emotionally. Can handle discomfort without falling apart. Seek challenges instead of avoiding them.

The difference was removing every comfort and forcing myself to face difficulty daily until I became capable again.

You’re probably too comfortable. Your life is probably too easy. That ease is destroying you slowly.

Remove the comforts. Add friction. Do hard things daily. Build back your strength.

The version of you that faces discomfort is infinitely stronger than the version that hides from it.

1r8y13d,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1r8y13d/peru_hop_trip_report/,Peru Hop trip report,"I really appreciate this forum, as it helped me immensely in planning my Peru trip, which was my first trip out of the US. I’m looking to pay it forward by sharing my experience.

I found Peru Hop through this forum, and looking at their site, it seemed like the perfect mix of guidance and freedom. Plus, I didn’t have a ton of time to plan out every detail, so this took some of that off my plate.

We took just under two weeks and bought the “Full South to Cusco” ticket. Did a mix of tours through PH and on our own through Viator.

Transport: Uber in Lima and Cusco was fine. Taxis at the airport are some of the pushiest people I came across. Did a pre-arranged hotel taxi for initial late night airport arrival and highly recommend that option as others have before.

Hotels: booked mostly through Booking.com. You pay on site generally. Had good experiences all around!

Safety: did get traveler’s diarrhea (seems like from rinsing toothbrush or maybe unpeeled fresh fruit)? AND it hit while on an overnight bus. Horrific. Became much more cautious after that - tossed the toothbrush, removed any uncooked veggies and garnishes, and no iced drinks. Have loperamide/simethicone tabs on hand, but be sure to only use when necessary (i.e. on overnight bus) so you can otherwise be passing the bacteria that cause the illness. Was over the main illness within 12 hours or so.

Peru Hop: so organized. Guides were incredible people. Cool people along the way. Overnight buses are rough, don’t get to see much and sleep is going to be relatively minimal. Plan for a chill / buffer day after if doing overnights. Can’t recommend them enough overall, loved the flexibility to plan our own trip and incredibly responsive over email ahead of time. We will definitely be looking into their other South American expansions because we loved them so much!

Lima - Barranco: so cool. Art and neat shops everywhere, plus great food. Did the food tour through Exquisito Peru -  highly recommend.

Lima - Miraflores: feels almost like you’re not in a different country at times, but excellent food and bars. Tomo Cocina Nikkei was a fantastic intro to Nikkei.

Paracas: loved it there! Excellent seafood, nice weather. Beach was a bit smelly and had lots of seaweed washed up. Would get a hotel with a pool next time.

Huacachina: dune buggies were awesome and hotels were beautiful and cheap. Hotel pool did close at 8pm which meant we barely got to use it as we left early the next morning. One full day does seem like enough time.

Nasca: did the flight to see the lines, super memorable. Lots of cool history, the aqueduct tour was great too. No need to stay overnight, could do the essentials in one day.

Arequipa: was too sick to really get to enjoy, but beautiful city. Can’t miss for sure.

Colca Canyon: did a two day tour which enabled seeing all the small towns and the condors. Incredible views, cool history, unique experience. We stayed in the Colca Lodge (hot springs hotel) which was beautiful and a total highlight. Their hot springs were quiet with 24 hour access and service was excellent. In hindsight, would have bought more souvenirs from the small towns along the canyon - money goes directly to local people and you’re talking with the person who definitely made the item. For the rest of the trip I often wondered if everything was made in China.

Puno: very different vibe. Lake Titicaca is beautiful. Did the quick floating islands tour, but honestly not sure if I would do it again. The drive from Arequipa to Puno was long and arduous, and Puno to Cusco also long. If you’re going to do the lake might be more worthwhile if you go to the Bolivian side. In addition, the islands tour was pushy about buying things to the point that it was uncomfortable. In hindsight, if just doing Puno would probably have been better to fly LATAM Arequipa -> Cusco.

Cusco: gorgeous city. Stayed in San Blas, would stay there again. The main ruins do require paying 130 soles in cash (per person) to get in to, we didn’t have enough on hand so just wandered free things on foot which was fun. Loved the garden off the Barrio café for chilling with a coffee. The city is cool - but the highlight seems to be the day trips you can do from there. Felt pretty satisfied with just a couple of days in Cusco itself.

Macchu Picchu: did a one day tour, was chaotic transferring from train to bus. Would love to return in non rainy season to hike, the Andes were incredible. Very grateful to have gotten to see it. Would have booked through the operator suggested by Peru Hop in hindsight as there were some hiccups that did risk missing our timed entry.

Thank you all for adding to this forum! It has been a great source of real life info and suggestions. ",1,1771504431.0,travel,0,1.0,False

1r8xyxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsetConqueror/comments/1r8xyxp/the_psychology_of_walking_into_any_room_and/,# The Psychology of Walking Into Any Room and Making Everyone Look Twice (Science-Based),"I spent way too much time studying what makes certain people magnetic. Not celebrities or influencers, just regular people who somehow command attention without trying. The kind who walk into a coffee shop and everyone's eyes just drift toward them.

After going down a rabbit hole of psychology research, behavioral science podcasts, and interviewing people who naturally have this quality, I realized most advice on presence is complete garbage. It's not about fake confidence tricks or memorizing body language poses. It's about something way more interesting.

The science is pretty clear. Humans are hardwired to notice people who seem comfortable in their own skin. Our brains literally light up differently when we encounter someone who moves with intention versus someone who's trying to disappear. This comes from research by Amy Cuddy at Harvard, she studies how people perceive power and presence. Turns out, the signals we send happen before we even open our mouths.

**Your body language is talking even when you're silent.** Most people shrink themselves without realizing it. Crossed arms, hunched shoulders, looking at phones to avoid eye contact. It's like you're trying to take up as little space as possible. The fix isn't to suddenly act like you own the place, it's to just stop apologizing for existing. Stand up straight but relaxed. When you walk, move like you have somewhere to be but you're not stressed about it. Make eye contact for 2-3 seconds before looking away, that sweet spot between creepy staring and nervous avoidance.

**Slow down everything by 20%.** This one's weird but it works. People with real presence don't rush. They don't fidget. They pause before speaking. There's actual neuroscience behind this, when you move deliberately, you activate your prefrontal cortex which makes you appear more in control and trustworthy. I learned this from Vanessa Van Edwards who runs a human behavior lab, she breaks down microexpressions and body language in her book [Captivate](https://a.co/d/06yNaNRn). The book is insanely good at explaining why some people just radiate confidence. It's not genetics, it's thousands of tiny behavioral choices you can actually learn.

**Energy management matters more than charisma.** You know how some people just drain you? And others make you feel more alive? That's not random. Your emotional state is contagious, literally. Mirror neurons in other people's brains fire when they're around you, making them unconsciously match your vibe. If you walk in anxious and closed off, people feel that. If you're genuinely at ease and open, they feel that too.

The app Atom (yes it's for habit tracking but hear me out) helped me realize how much my energy fluctuates based on basics like sleep, whether I exercised, if I ate like crap. When you track this stuff you start seeing patterns. The days you feel magnetic? Usually the days you took care of yourself first.

**Stop trying to be interesting, be interested instead.** This flips everything. When you're focused on how you're coming across, you're in your head, self conscious, monitoring every word. When you're genuinely curious about others, asking real questions, actually listening, you become present. And presence is what people remember.

Psychologist Carl Rogers spent his career studying what makes certain therapists more effective and it came down to this, genuine interest and presence. His work shows up everywhere in modern psychology. When you make someone feel seen and heard, they associate that feeling with you.

The book [The Charisma Myth](https://a.co/d/0j9Jjeh7) by Olivia Fox Cabane breaks this down brilliantly. She interviewed executives, performers, people who need to command rooms professionally. The pattern? They all mastered presence through specific mental techniques, not personality transplants. One trick she teaches: before entering any room, spend 60 seconds focusing only on your breathing and the physical sensations in your body. This pulls you out of your anxious thoughts and into the present moment. Sounds simple but it genuinely works.

If you want a more structured way to internalize all this, there's an AI learning app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that pulls from books like The Charisma Myth, Captivate, research on presence and body language, and turns them into personalized audio learning plans. You can set a specific goal like ""become magnetic in social situations as an introvert"" and it generates a tailored plan with episodes you can adjust from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples.

The voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's a smoky, confident tone that makes even dry psychology concepts feel engaging. You can also pause mid-episode to ask your AI coach Freedia questions or get clarifications on specific techniques. It connects insights across multiple sources instead of just giving you isolated book summaries.

**Your face needs to match your words.** A lot of people have dead eyes when they talk. They're saying friendly things but their expression is flat or distracted. Researchers call this emotional incongruence and it makes people deeply uncomfortable on a subconscious level. Your face should reflect what you're actually feeling. If something's funny, let yourself smile fully. If you're engaged, let your eyes show it. This isn't about being fake expressive, it's about not suppressing your natural reactions.

**Dress like you give a shit but not like you're trying too hard.** You don't need designer clothes. You need clothes that fit well and make you feel good. There's a massive psychological effect called enclothed cognition, what you wear literally changes how you think and behave. When you know you look put together, you carry yourself differently. Other people pick up on that instantly.

The real secret though? None of this works if you're doing it to impress others or prove something. People can smell try hard energy from across the room. The goal is to become someone who's comfortable being themselves in any environment. That comfort becomes magnetic because it's so rare. Most people are performing, anxious, seeking validation. When you're just existing confidently in your own skin, you stand out by default.",1,1771504251.0,MindsetConqueror,0,1.0,False

Albert \[06:12:53\]:

Absolutely! Here are some ideas for your morning, tailored to different preferences—whether you're looking for calm, energizing, productive, or reflective:

\### 🧘‍♂️ Mindful & Calm

\- Start with 5–10 minutes of meditation or deep breathing to center yourself.

\- Enjoy a moment of silence with a cup of tea or coffee while reading a few uplifting quotes or affirmations.

\- Listen to a short podcast or play on your phone about mindfulness or personal growth.

\### 🚀 Productive & Focused

\- Plan your top 3 priorities for the day—write them down and tackle the most important one first.

\- Review your schedule or to-do list to avoid feeling overwhelmed later.

\- Use a ""morning routine"" tool or app to set goals for the day.

\### 🏃‍♂️ Active & Energetic

\- Go for a morning walk or run to get moving and clear your head.

\- Try a quick home workout or yoga session—there are tons of free videos on YouTube!

\- Stretch outside in the fresh air to energize your body and mind.

\### 🧠 Creative & Reflective

\- Journal about your hopes, goals, or challenges for the day—morning pages can help with clarity.

\- Sketch something, write a poem, or brainstorm ideas for a project.

\- Listen to music that inspires you and think about how you can apply its energy to your day.

\### 🎯 Simple & Enjoyable

\- Enjoy a healthy breakfast with a positive mindset—maybe try something new!

\- Read a few pages of a book you’ve been wanting to dive into.

\- Set a goal for a small skill you can practice this morning (like drawing, coding, or language learning).

1. Laneige lip glowy balm in Mango : (my sister took this one for her :') ) I love this the most among the 3 or any of the tube or stick type lip balms I have ever tried, it hydrates my lips for more than 3-4 hours and even after it wears off although it leaves no tint on the lips. It's not as comparable to the Laneige sleeping mask but it's halfway there imo and I wish it had spf in it.

2. Foxtale brightening lip balm spf 30 : this one has sheer reddish mauve tint and moisturizes my lips for 2-3 hrs. Has a sweet taste and equally sweet fragrance that personally for me is bearable considering I have tortured myself to use up two or three of the dot & key gloss boss lip balm in cocoa mint earlier just cz of its pretty tint but it used to leave such a bitter taste in my mouth and throat, so compared to that this one is nice.

3. Inde Wild dewy lip treatment (DLT) in Caffeine Addict : I love the tint of this one, it's a cool tone brown with sheer to medium opacity, an anomaly among the sea of orange brown lippies in India. The smell what I suppose was to be like coffee or roasted coffee beans, is weird to say the least, to me it just smells like burnt coffee or roasted rice tbh and has no taste. On top of that the moisturization is mid, barely does anything for my lips for an hour and it's gone, even the foxtale hydrates my lips more than this one. And when it wears off my lips are on the cusp of dryness again....idk what the hype for the DLTs are or is it only for the clear one? Thankfully I live in a very humid climate and my lips don't dry up a tonne except in winter, so I'll use this one up although I wish this one had spf in it so I could use it when I go out and about.

In terms of most to least moisturizing: Laneige sleeping mask > laneige lip glowy balm > Foxtale brightening lip balm > Inde Wilde DLT

I was really on the hunt for a good stick or tube type lip balm that has spf, has neutral to cool brown tint (none of that orange brown but muted reddish or pinkish brown works), doesn't leave a bitter taste in mouth, moisturizing and affordable and the foxtale and Inde Wilde is what I landed on but I'm not Fully satisfied lol but it'll do ",1,1771504153.0,IndianBeautyTalks,0,1.0,False

Stuff is going well for me. I'm at my dream university, there are lots of lovely old buildings I see every day. I love that. I've got to know some new people, had pancake Tuesday with them. The sun's finally come out after weeks, the rain's stopped so I've got rowing on again tomorrow. 

Went to the pub last night, got tipsy without getting pissed. Went home to my absolutely wonderful gf and she gave me head. I mean fuck that's so awesome that I have someone like her in my life.

I got some new shoes recently, which I really like. There's a ball on Saturday which is going to be bloody good fun. Going to a 21st birthday party today! Sometimes I wish I had a more active social life, so having a lot on feels good. 

I really enjoyed the lecture I was just in, it's a topic that I love to learn about. I finally finished painting a unit of Warhammer a couple days ago, and I'm rather proud of my edge highlighting. It's nice to have visual evidence of having improved at something, you know?

On a more general level I've got a good relationship with my brother, I love my parents, and I'm financially supported. Exams and summatives are going to suck balls, but I've got fun stuff on the horizon after that.

We're not broken versions of neurotypicals. We're a different kind of processor. And different processors exist because civilization needs them. It always has.

History is full of us — even when no one had a name for it.

**Isaac Newton** couldn't maintain a single friendship. He feuded with Leibniz for decades over credit for calculus. He stuck a needle behind his own eye to study optics. He'd go days locked away without eating. And he rewrote the laws that govern the universe.

**Charles Darwin** obsessively collected beetles before he collected evidence. He took twenty years to publish *On the Origin of Species* — not for lack of certainty, but out of dread of the confrontation that would follow. He needed Thomas Huxley to defend the theory in public because he couldn't handle the fight. And he explained how life works.

**Antoine Lavoisier** woke up three hours before his day job to work in his laboratory. He weighed everything — before and after, obsessively. He built his own scales because the available ones weren't precise enough. He needed his wife Marie-Anne to translate from English, illustrate equipment, record experiments, and organize publications. He founded modern chemistry. He was guillotined by people who didn't understand what they had in front of them.

**Socrates** walked barefoot in the snow, lost in thought for hours, ignoring cold and hunger. He never wrote a single line. He needed Plato to record every word. He founded Western philosophy without leaving a single document.

**Nikola Tesla** saw numbers in colors, slept two hours a night, had inflexible rituals, and died alone in a hotel room with a pigeon as his only companion. He invented the electrical system that powers the world that lets you read this text.

**Leonardo da Vinci** left notebooks full of inventions that wouldn't be understood for centuries. He wrote in mirror script. He shifted obsessively between interests. He finished very few works. He conceived the helicopter, the tank, modern anatomy, hydraulic engineering — and died thinking he hadn't done enough.

**Albert Einstein** spoke late. He thought in images, not words. Difficult marriages. Terrible at everything that didn't interest him. He redesigned the structure of space, time, and energy.

**Alan Turing** was socially displaced, literal to the extreme, unable to navigate social conventions. He was imprisoned and chemically castrated for being who he was. He took his own life at 41. Before that, he invented computing, broke the Enigma code, and helped win a world war.

**Michelangelo** worked for days without eating, slept in his boots, kept human relationships to a minimum, had a temperament that drove nearly everyone away. He painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel lying on scaffolding for four years. He painted God.

**Ludwig van Beethoven** had absolutely inflexible routines. He counted exactly sixty coffee beans every morning. He progressively lost his hearing. And deaf, he composed the Ninth Symphony — the most celebrated piece of music in human history.

Ten names. None of them ""functioned well"" in the way the world uses that phrase. All of them functioned perfectly — at the frequency they were made for.

And there's a pattern no one talks about: none of them worked alone. Newton had Halley to publish the Principia. Darwin had Huxley. Lavoisier had Marie-Anne. Socrates had Plato. Every rare processor needed someone who translated, organized, protected, connected. Because those who see far stumble on what's close. It's always been that way.

Our traits complement those of neurotypicals. It's not defect versus normal. It's function and function. The neurotypical keeps civilization running. We push it forward. Without them, no stability. Without us, no breakthroughs. Both together built everything that exists.

Now the part we need to say out loud.

When our processor has nothing to process, it doesn't rest. It turns on us. The same hyperfocus that connects impossible domains, without direction, connects evidence that we're useless. The same engine that produces theory in the morning, without a mission in the afternoon, produces a spiral.

*""I'm worthless.""* *""Nobody understands me.""* *""Why bother if I never finish anything.""*

This isn't weakness. It isn't laziness. It isn't a lack of willpower. It's a Formula 1 engine idling in neutral. And neutral for us isn't neutral — it's self-destruction.

The depression so many of us know isn't a separate illness. It's a side effect of a processor without a road. The solution was never just chemical. It was mission. Direction. Someone or something that says ""process this"" and lets the engine do what it was born to do.

And then I look at the world and think: how many of us are right now, this very moment, with the most powerful telescope in the room pointed inward, quietly destroying themselves, because no one ever said ""point it outward and tell me what you see""?

How many Darwins are collecting beetles alone? How many Lavoisiers are weighing things in a garage with no Marie-Anne? How many Turings are writing brilliant code in a dark room thinking they have no value?

I don't have all the answers. But I have one conviction: we need to find each other. Not for a support group. Not for collective therapy. For production. For someone to look at what another sees and say ""this is real, this has value, and I'm going to help you deliver it.""

I'm working on it. A bridge between isolated processors and the world that needs what they see. It's still a seed. But seeds are what we do best — we just forget to plant them because we're too busy redesigning the entire garden in our heads.

If this makes sense to you, talk to me. You don't need to be eloquent. You don't need to be organized. You just need to be honest.

We weren't broken. We were built to spec. The world just hasn't read the manual yet. Neither have most of us.

And maybe it's time we wrote it ourselves.

1r8xn2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1r8xn2b/best_friend_of_15_years_cut_me_off_completely_am/,Best friend of 15 years cut me off completely. Am I in the wrong?,"Hey guys! This is going to be a long post and partially I need an honest opinion of people not involved in the situation and partially a bit of compassion because I feel really hurt. So here goes. 

Me (35f) and my friend (35f) were best friends since we met when we were 19 yo. We would be inseparable, always doing things together, having small trips, art sessions, at home karaoke nights etc. She used to say that I knew her like nobody else did, that she’s so lucky to have a friend like me. I’m not showing off, I’m just telling this to let you know that I wasn’t the only one who felt like she’s my closest friend. 

A couple years ago I had to move to the next city and slowly we began to become more distant. But we would still try to maintain our friendship, constantly chatting, sending memes and ideas for our next hang out. We would watch movies together, send each other small gifts, I would crochet stuff for her that she would ask me to crochet etc. 

The only problem was that whenever I was back to my hometown I would meet her but she would avoid visiting me. Her gran is very old and she always needs someone by her side so I would never say anything on that matter. 

Also my friend met another girl she grew very close to. They would become best friends and I was kind of set aside a bit and though it hurt me, again I would never ever express any sadness or resentment or anything bad at all. I understand that I am not the centre of the universe and that it’s amazing that my friend met someone else who she feels really close to. 

But then happened this situation that escalated rapidly. My friend sent me pictures from Japan. I said “damn! so beautiful! are you in Japan?” Turned out she arrived in Japan three days ago and she flew with her former classmate she occasionally meets for coffee twice a year. I was surprised as she’s not the person to do something like that with someone she’s not very close to. I said that I’m confused why she didn’t tell me she planned to go to Japan at all. Then I found out that all the preparation for the trip took her three months, never mentioning that to me.

I also expressed my feelings about the fact that for four years since I moved I would constantly invite her to visit. My current city is big and beautiful and it also has the biggest Japanese park in Europe with historical buildings, koi ponds, waterfalls, zen gardens, cute themed coffee shops and Buddhist temples. Plus I suggested visiting other places together. But she would always say she has no money (which isn’t true, her family lives in NY, they have their own business, also she has several properties she lends to people and she doesn’t even have to work to make money, in fact she doesn’t work for 3 years already) and that she can’t leave her gran alone. 

I also understand that there’s a huge difference between the next city where I live and Japan, right? So it’s understandable that she found the opportunity to go there. 

What breaks me the most is that since I expressed my feelings in a very rational and polite way without being rude or overly emotional she cut me off completely. She doesn’t reply to my messages and avoid any contact whatsoever.

At first I thought maybe she needs some time to cool off. That I was a bad friend because instead of being happy for her I expressed my disappointment. It all happened in September but it’s her birthday today and I sent her a message. I didn’t mentioned the situation at all and just wished her a happy birthday in a warm way. You can watch the screenshot yourself. 

She would glance at my message and ignored again. 

I honestly feel like shit. Some people fight with each other, they do things that disappoint their loved ones but they still end up being close if they want to. And she just threw me away from her life like trash as if I did something unspeakable. Also I need to mention that there was nothing bad between us prior to that. No fight, no disagreement, nothing like that. So it struck me like a lightning.

Do I deserve it? I really don’t understand anything to this point. Should I try again? I feel like the door is closed. Please be honest.

1r8xksx,https://www.reddit.com/r/idiomsite/comments/1r8xksx/what_does_the_english_idiom_be_a_doll_actually/,"What does the English idiom ""be a doll"" actually mean? (And where did it come from?)","I've seen the phrase ""be a doll"" pop up in old movies, books, and sometimes in casual conversation (especially from older speakers), like:

* ""Hey, be a doll and grab me a coffee?""
* ""Would you be a doll and help me with this?""

It sounds super polite and a bit old-fashioned, but what's the exact meaning and backstory?

Basically, **""be a doll"" is a friendly, affectionate way to ask someone to do you a small favor**. It's like saying ""pretty please"" but with extra charm — you're calling the person sweet, kind, or helpful in advance, hoping they'll act that way. It's very light-hearted and informal, often used between friends or in playful/flirty contexts.

The origin ties back to ""doll"" as a term of endearment. Starting in the 19th/early 20th century, ""doll"" was slang for an attractive or charming person (especially a woman), similar to ""babe"" or ""sweetheart"" today. By the mid-20th century (think 1950s American English), it evolved into this polite request pattern.

One of the earliest clear examples comes from the 1955 novel *Auntie Mame* by Patrick Dennis, where a character says something very close: ""Patrick, dear, will you be a doll and get your Auntie Mame a martini?"" That line (and the 1958 film version with Rosalind Russell) helped popularize it in pop culture.

It's mostly American English, quite dated now (you'll hear it more from boomers or in retro media), but still perfectly understood. Some people find it cute/endearing; others think it sounds a little patronizing depending on tone and context.

Over the past 14 months, my symptoms increased to where they were completely uncontrolled, lansoprazole was doing nothing, food was coming back up with no trigger, my quality of life plummeted.

In Jul 25 I had a endoscopy which found a 3cm hiatus hernia, and I decided to go private with treatment. The manometry (miserable, but manageable) and the 24hr impedance test (not quite as miserable, but a lot longer) proved GERD and pathological reflux.

i read it and thought thats the most neurotic thing ive ever heard. who journals their tuesday.

then literally that same week i went to dinner with friends. someone asked me how my weekend was. i said ""good, pretty chill"" and the conversation moved on without me. i sat there for the next twenty minutes watching everyone else tell stories about the most mundane stuff. a weird interaction at a coffee shop. something someones kid said. a podcast episode that made them rethink something.

none of it was groundbreaking. but everyone was engaged. laughing. talking.

and i was sitting there like a sim character waiting for someone to click on me

heres the thing tho. stuff DID happen to me that week. i saw things. i had thoughts. i had a whole interaction at the grocery store that was lowkey funny. but when someone asked, my brain served me absolutely nothing. like the wifi disconnected between my memory and my mouth

so fine. i tried the stupid phone note thing

first few days were embarassing. my entries were like

* went to target
* made pasta
* watched 3 episodes of something i already forgot

groundbreaking stuff. pulitzer worthy

but then something kinda shifted. i started noticing things i normally wouldnt even register. a weird sign outside a gas station. a conversation i overheard at the gym that made me laugh. a random thought about why i always pick the same seat at resturants even when the whole place is empty

none of it was a big deal. but when someone asked me ""whats been going on"" the next week i had stuff to say for the first time in like months. and the conversation didnt die after two sentences which felt like a miracle honestly

the other thing that helped was writing a quick note after conversations. not word for word. more like ""talked to jake about his trip, forgot to ask about the new job thing, bring that up next time."" sounds psychotic i know but it made me realize i never actually paid attention before. i was always half zoned out thinking about what to say next instead of listening

still working on this. some weeks i forget to write anything down. some conversations i still buffer like a youtube video on bad wifi. but the blank brain thing happens way less now

been saving everything thats helped me with this stuff along the way. books, methods, small tricks that made conversations less painful. i keep it all organized where people can grab it if theyre dealing with the same thing on my profile.

genuine question tho. when someone asks ""hows it going"" do you go blank because nothing comes to mind?? or do you have stuff to say but cant figure out how to say it without sounding weird?? curious which one it is for most people cause i think theyre two completely different problems",22,1771502891.0,socialskills,7,0.97,False

We were together for 10 months. During that time I kept noticing she gets blackout drunk when she drinks. Not to the point of passing out, but to the point of completely having altered personality and no memory of anything the next day. At first I chucked it off to her having recently started drinking again after 10 years of abstinence, because 10 years prior shit hit the fan with her drinking habits (late teens, early 20s). She thought she can drink safely and moderately now. So after 10 years of sobriety, I figured she doesn't know her limit. Plus it was summer, so I chucked it off to summer vibe.

But over time a pattern was noticeable. She would change moods in a heartbeat. She would go from angry to horny and back. It was impossible to keep up. She would become mean and insult me. For example, if she became horny but all I could see was a drunk woman and didn't feel like having sex, she would get mad, leave the house, throw some tantrums, threaten that there are guys who will if I wont, etc. She would also pick fights out of nowhere. One time we were about to go to sleep when she just imagined I ""was looking at some woman"" the day before and was mean about it. The whole thing was nonsense. The next morning she would have no recollection of it and would apologize and say she won't do it again.

I started telling her when sober ""I don't like it when you drink, you become someone else, I would prefer if you didn't drink like you didn't for 10 years"". She would agree that its a waste of whole day being hungover and would apologize for being mean, but claimed she has no recollection of that. These kinds of fights were becoming often.

After summer there was a nice period where we didn't go out as much and had less opportunity to drink. I almost forgot about that problem. But there was another problem. She was reluctant to meet my friends. Claimed she is introverted and has social anxiety. But there are a few really close friends of mine, also couples, and it didn't make sense to keep her hidden forever.

One time we had friends over, she gave me a beer and had a beer for herself. Next thing I know, my beer is gone, and theres a few more bottles of beer on the table. When I said ""where's my beer? you must be drinking them in one gulp!?"" she got mad and ruined the evening with her behavior. She ignored my friends, didn't participate in activities anymore, went on balcony to smoke, etc. Cue another fight and another talk tomorrow about her drinking habits.

I can't even remember all those kinds of events. It became something predictable to me. I became almost immune to those fights, I was just going through the motions ""ok now she's leaving...ok now she's back...now she's yelling, now she's insulting my friends, now she's dancing and asking me to have sex...."". I started to lose patience so I would sometimes try to nip that in the bud by being rude myself. Other times I would just read a book while she's having a meltdown.

One major event happened on a friend's birthday party (same friend from before). In a group of 10 people, where she only knows 2, she was the only one to get drunk. She got so drunk, her head was just hanging above the plate on the table and she couldn't talk. When we left I scolded her saying ""you embarrassed yourself and me. This is the first impression you are leaving for those people"" etc. We got into a huge fight with her classic exiting and entering the house, insulting, etc. I just tried to go to bed but she was relentless. At one point I yelled ""get in or get out, just leave me alone"" and she started hugging me and crying saying ""I won't leave you alone"".

The next day and over the course of some time I kept telling her I've had enough. I do not have it in me to live another one of those scenes. If she has another drink, I am gone.

She said ""you cannot expect me never to have another drink, not even for cheers at some events."" and said I am pressuring her. Said it would be better to just leave her next time she does it than to announce it like this. Said that she can drink moderately and she will never repeat those kinds of scenes again. I said I don't believe she can drink moderately and I won't risk it. If she has another drop, I'm gone.

Then there was another major gathering where she, even in the morning while driving there (I'm driving), had some liquor. I was not happy about it, but I got a little soft because I understand she is under pressure because of the gathering with her anxiety and all. She had some drinks, but did not get drunk and the event went fine.

A week after that we went to another couple because they are inviting us to their wedding and she never met them. They offered some drinks, she chose wine. I watched her drink 4 glasses by the time I had one glass of beer. I started pointing it out to her that she needs to slow down and mind her drinking. She did not like that. She ended up getting drunk there.

On the way home I started saying ""you did it again. what did I say will happen if you do it again? do you want to break up? do you just want to push me to do it?""

She just started dancing drunkenly in the car, insulting my friends, telling me to shut up, etc. When she got mean, and knowing what's in store for me for the rest of the evening, the words ""that's it. we're done, you will take your stuff and go home tonight"" just came out of me.

She started slamming the doors, throwing stuff around the house, started saying some guy will pick her up. When I said ""I am taking you home right now"" she said ""I will leave when I feel like it"".

At that moment I just saw my entire evening in a glimpse and decided I will not live out another one of those endless traumatic scenes. I took my phone out and dialed 911. Told them ""I have a weird situation. My ex refuses to leave my house"". When she heard I'm serious, she started hitting me and kicking me. I told the cops ""as we speak, she is hitting me, hurry up"". After I hung up, she continued to kick me. I forcibly took her out of the house and locked the doors.

Then she started slamming on the doors with her hands and feet and endlessly ringing the doorbell. She did not say a word, she was a zombie. She was just kicking the doors for like 10 minutes. At that point I knew there's no going back. The whole neighbourhood is witnessing this. I started recording it for police and to share it with some people to keep me in check. There is no more ignoring this. We are not going to forget about this in the morning like always. This time there will be consequences.

Then she left and stopped the first car that drove by. It was accidentally a guy I know, but she doesn't. She asked him to drive her home. During the trip she even accused him of ""wanting to fuck her"" which I'm afraid was more of an invitation than anything. Like I said, she gets extremely horny drunk and from the stories she told me about that 10+ years earlier, many people were happy about her drinking.

Then she came back to my house and started endlessly ringing the doorbell again. Then the cops showed up and handcuffed her and took her to the station where she spent the night. I did not intend on her spending the night in jail. I thought cops will come and she will fear the authority and leave, but because they have it on recording that she hit me, it had to be jail.

The next day she called me and cried and apologized and all that. I told her it's the end, I cannot save her. I took all her stuff back to her apartment so there is nothing for her to come back for.

We met a few days later out of my weakness. She said she is done with alcohol for life, that this was a wakeup call she needed, that she will change her ways, that she is ready for a life in line with her age, that she wants to be clean, focused, have a family, etc. I said I don't think she'll change. She tried once 10 years ago and again slipped. Next stressful moment will reset her habits again, I cannot risk it. We both cried and I told her she needs to give up on me.

There you have it. And after all this, I am still second guessing myself, wondering if I can give her another chance, maybe she will get her act together after this.

Even without alcohol she was picking stupid fights, kept the house a mess, showed no real capability for responsibility, etc. We fought daily. All my friends hate her now and do not want me to entertain the idea of getting back to her for one second. I have a hard time dealing with her promiscuous past, mostly alcohol driven.

But on the other hand, when things were great she was a sweetheart. I never doubted her love for me, that she is dedicated to me, that she prioritizes me. I felt loved and I loved her. She's extremely funny and we could talk about anything. I loved just going for coffee with her. Lots of great memories between us. The fights she would pick could also be quickly resolved. I wonder if I didn't have the right approach, didn't support her in the way she needed. I miss her.",1,1771502714.0,AskMenRelationships,0,1.0,False

1r8xgtl,https://linktr.ee/universityexploitsbyjx,The CAMS Command Protocol: Your Blueprint for Elite Compliance Certification,"**The Shift: A Test of Judgment, Not Just Memorization**  
Passing the Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist (CAMS) exam is not merely about memorizing the 40 Recommendations of the FATF or reciting the USA PATRIOT Act sections. That is the amateur view. The CAMS exam is a ruthless assessment of **Risk Management and Operational Judgment.**

It is designed to simulate the seat of a Compliance Officer: analyzing vague scenarios, balancing regulatory requirements against business operations, and making the ""least bad"" decision under pressure.

Treating the CAMS like a university history exam is why many experienced banking professionals fail on their first attempt. The winning approach is to treat the exam as a Simulation of Protocol. You aren't just answering questions; you are protecting the institution.

**At a Glance (The CAMS Breakdown)**  
The exam is a marathon, not a sprint. You have 3.5 hours to answer 120 multiple-choice questions.

* **Chapter 1 (Risks & Methods):** Understanding how money launderers and terrorist financiers move value (Trade-Based ML, Black Market Peso Exchange, Crypto).
* **Chapter 2 (International Standards):** The ""Heavy Hitter."" FATF, EU Directives, Wolfsberg Group, Basel Committee, and Egmont Group. This is usually the densest material.
* **Chapter 3 (AML/CFT Compliance Programs):** The ""How-To."" Risk assessments, internal controls, audits, and training.
* **Chapter 4 (Conducting Investigations):** The ""Action."" STR/SAR filing, law enforcement cooperation, and international mutual legal assistance.

**The ""Compliance Engine"" (The Active Mindset)**  
Your secret weapon. The high-scorer understands that ACAMS creates questions where **two or three answers are technically correct.** The challenge is finding the best answer based on the ACAMS hierarchy.

1. **The ""ACAMS World"" vs. The Real World:** In your actual job, you might call a client immediately to clarify a transaction. In ""ACAMS World,"" that might be ""Tipping Off"" (a crime). **Forget your company’s internal policy.** The Study Guide is the only truth.
2. **The ""First Step"" Logic:** Questions will ask, ""What should the compliance officer do?"" You must identify the immediate next step. Do you file an STR? Or do you review the account history first? (Hint: You usually investigate before you file).

**The Challenge: Three Score-Killing Traps**

**1. The ""Experience"" Bias**  
Senior compliance officers often fail because they answer based on their bank's procedures. ACAMS tests on global standards (FATF/Wolfsberg), not your specific bank's risk appetite. If the Study Guide says X and your boss says Y, on the exam, the answer is X.

**2. The ""Acronym Soup"" Fatigue**  
FATF, FSRB, OFAC, FinCEN, FIU. Students glaze over the nuances. You must know the difference between a ""recommendation"" (FATF) and a ""law"" (USA PATRIOT Act). You must know who has extraterritorial reach (USA) and who is just an advisory body (Wolfsberg).

**3. The ""Scenario"" Paralysis**  
Scenarios often contain ""red herrings""—details meant to distract you. You need to identify the predicate offense or the specific red flag hidden in a paragraph of fluff text.

**The High-Score Protocol: A System for Certification**

**Phase 1 — The Reconnaissance (Skim & Structure)**  
Objective: Understand the landscape.  
Read the **Official Study Guide** cover to cover without taking notes. Just understand the flow. Chapter 2 is the beast; do not let it discourage you.

**Phase 2 — The Deep Dive (The Flashcard Forge)**  
Objective: Memorization of Standards.  
You cannot ""logic"" your way through the specifics of the EU Directives.

* **The Trinity of 2s:** Know the difference between the 4th, 5th, and 6th EU Directives.
* **FATF 40:** You don’t need to memorize the text, but you must know the categories (e.g., which recommendations apply to shell banks? Which apply to casinos?).
* **USA PATRIOT Act:** Memorize Section 311, 312, 313, 314(a), 314(b), and 319.

**Phase 3 — Scenario Application**  
Objective: Applying knowledge to ""What would you do?"" questions.  
Focus on **Chapter 4**. This is where the money is made. Understanding the difference between a subpoena, a search warrant, and a freezing order is critical.

**Your Resource Trinity (Quality over Quantity)**

1. **The Official Study Guide (The Bible):** Do not use a guide from 2018. Regulations change (e.g., Crypto rules). Use the PDF provided upon registration.
2. **examtopics / AML-Assassin (The Drill):** While you should be wary of user-generated answers, seeing the style of questions is invaluable. ACAMS questions are worded very specifically (e.g., ""Greatest risk,"" ""Most likely"").
3. **Quizlet (The Vocabulary):** Search for ""CAMS 6th Edition"" (or current). Drill the definitions of Placement, Layering, Integration until you can spot them in your sleep.

**8-Week Accelerator (The Roadmap)**

* **Week 1:** Read Chapters 1 & 3 (The easier chapters). Understand the basics of Money Laundering cycles.
* **Week 2:** Chapter 2 Deep Dive (Part A). FATF & Basel Committee. This is dry. Drink coffee.
* **Week 3:** Chapter 2 Deep Dive (Part B). Wolfsberg, EU Directives, US Laws (Patriot Act).
* **Week 4:** Chapter 4 (Investigations). Learn the STR/SAR filing timeline and ""Tipping Off"" rules.
* **Week 5:** Flashcard Intensity. Memorize the specific dollar thresholds (e.g., $3,000 for Record Keeping, $10,000 for CTR).
* **Week 6:** Practice Exam 1. Review every wrong answer. Was it a knowledge gap or a logic gap?
* **Week 7:** Targeted Review. Re-read the sections of the Study Guide where you are weak.
* **Week 8:** Final Simulation. Rest 24 hours before the exam.

**FAQ**

**Q: Is the CAMS certification worth the cost?**  
A: In the compliance world, yes. It is the gold standard. It is often the gatekeeper for ""Manager"" and ""VP"" titles and serves as a major salary lever.

**Q: How hard is the math?**  
A: Non-existent. This is a logic and law test, not a math test.

**Q: What is the passing score?**  
A: You need 75 out of 120 questions. However, questions are weighted. Do not aim for 75; aim for mastery, as the experimental questions (which don't count) can throw off your internal count.

**Q: Can I take it online?**  
A: Yes, via Pearson VUE online proctoring. Warning: The proctors are strict. If you look off-screen or mouth words to yourself, they will terminate your exam.

**Quick Start Checklist:**

1. Secure funding (Ask your employer to sponsor; it costs \~$1,900 USD for non-members).
2. Download the **CAMS Candidate Handbook**.
3. Print the **Official Study Guide** (Physical paper is better for highlighting/active reading).
4. Join the ""Anti-Money Laundering"" groups on LinkedIn for industry trends.
5. Book your exam date for 3 months out. Pressure creates diamonds.

The sunlight peeks through the curtains. 

The chill of the morning feels comfortable,

and underneath the heavy duvet, it feels like home.



She touches my hair, caresses my face, and smiles. 

She rises, and I pull on her hand, begging her to stay a little bit more. 

But to no avail; she makes her way to the kitchen.



In a methodical routine, she washes the dishes, dries, and ranges them. 

She makes coffee for her, chocolate milk for me, and one omelet that we share. 

Before I'm even properly awake, she comes back to the room. 

*""Come on little monkey, let's eat.""*



Laying my head on her lap, I look at her, and a wave of sadness overtakes me. 

I feel awful about the way I behave. 

I'm often hard on her, and she is so patient.



We don't lay in bed anymore like we used to when I was little. 

And as I grew, I realized how much of her time went into me. 

Always more preoccupied with me, than herself. 

She had little left to herself. 

Her birthday became our day, her clothes our clothes, her house our home. 



Now that I'm an adult, I want to give some of it back. 

I fail, many times still; I can't help but act childish around her. 

I just want to see her happy, fulfilled. 

I want to see her being herself.

1r8xc5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianrealestate/comments/1r8xc5r/double_balcony_living_at_harico_divaam_elevate/,Double Balcony Living at Harico Divaam: Elevate Daily Life,"https://preview.redd.it/a213v5ekxfkg1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3b3f515ef53dc344896f597c1ae72541e3fd440

Most apartments come with a single balcony — a modest extension of your living space, often used for drying clothes, a few plants, or an occasional cup of coffee. While it’s appreciated, it rarely changes the way you experience your home. [Harico Divaam](https://harico-divaam.com/) in Kiwale takes a different approach with double balconies — one off the living room and another connected directly to the master bedroom — transforming everyday living in ways you’ll notice every day.

**Mornings you’ll Look Forward To**

Imagine stepping straight out of your bedroom onto a private balcony each morning. No navigating the living room, no disturbing anyone else. Just fresh air, sunlight, and a quiet moment to start your day.

**The two balconies serve different purposes:**

Communal balcony for family evenings, entertaining, or relaxing together

Private bedroom balcony for solitude, reading, or morning coffee

This design gives you the mental and emotional benefits of outdoor access twice over. Studies show that exposure to fresh air and natural light reduces stress, improves sleep, and boosts overall wellbeing.

**Light, Air, and Comfort**

Double balconies aren’t just about aesthetics. By creating openings on multiple sides, [Harico Divaam Kiwale](https://harico-divaam.com/) promotes cross-ventilation, allowing air to flow naturally through the home. This reduces reliance on air conditioning, lowers energy costs, and keeps rooms comfortable year-round.

Natural light enters from multiple angles, keeping spaces brighter for longer. Whether its children doing homework, professionals working from home, or simply anyone who enjoys airy, open rooms, this design creates a noticeable improvement in daily life.

**Walk-In Wardrobe and High Ceilings**

A walk-in wardrobe may sound luxurious, but it’s practical too. It provides a dedicated space for dressing and organizing, keeps the bedroom clutter-free, and allows couples to avoid overlapping morning routines.

Harico Divaam also feature 9.85-foot ceilings, taller than the standard 9 feet. This subtle upgrade makes rooms feel more spacious, allows taller storage and statement lighting, and improves air circulation — all without adding extra square footage.

**Design with Purpose**

At [Sentosa Harico Divaam](https://harico-divaam.com/), every feature — double balconies, walk-in wardrobe, high ceilings, and cross-ventilation — is designed with one goal: to reduce stress, enhance wellbeing, and make daily life smoother.

Step into a show flat, explore both balconies, and experience the thoughtful design for yourself. You’ll see how small details combine to quietly elevate every day.",1,1771502298.0,indianrealestate,1,1.0,False

Notoriously difficult job market at the moment but I am grateful I had a remote job as a contractor to get some income. Had to work at a coffee shop for a bit and it was hell. 

But this week, I got 2 offers. One for a sales position at a big international insurance company in a growing market, decent base salary (€39.2k + comm) and benefits. Other one is business development for a recruitment company, salary (€32k + comm + bonus). 

My goal was to get a job in real estate as I studied it and to earn my professional certification as a chartered surveyor. I have only been applying for a month but the feedback I got is that only people who studied here are getting the entry level roles. 

Any advice? Should I take one of the roles and keep on searching for real estate positions that will pay around €32k for the next 2 years until I get my certification?

1r8xarp,https://i.redd.it/r96hjglhxfkg1.jpeg,Goatwitch (short story),"She said her name was Maab. He didn't believe her. Until the end. 

Earliest morning. Still dark. The far off horizon hadn't yet birthed the sun. She'd said it must be so. 

He followed her, the hunched over black robed and hooded goblin shape that had only the semblance of a woman's old and weathered voice with which to perhaps mark her as human. 

She was not one of God's children. 

He followed her into the graveyard. So that they might fulfill the rite. 

And pull one back. 

She said it could be done. The thing that might be a woman that called itself Maab. And though it was vile blasphemy to do so, Wyckoff prayed that the foul shape in black was able to actually perform the ebon necromantic arts. 

Please. God forgive me. Please. 

I just want her back. Please just give her back to me. 

Maab-thing had croaked orders to him before they'd departed the village proper. Instructions. And materials needed. 

The place, the wound in time and nature, it must drink…

The place was shrouded in swamp gas and white blankets of heavy rolling fog. It was the only thing moving with any kind of life in the rotten cemetery. Neglected. Time had won a terrible battle here. Bomb-blasted and nearly primeval. It was as if the prehistoric age was reaching a clawing vengeful grasp from all the way back and digging in its terrible wounding marks here. 

In this place. Of cold. And sweat. 

Everything was rotten and rotting in this place and Wyckoff would've sworn that he felt the very air of the foul place begin on him its own putrefying process of slow decay. 

If I stay here long enough with that crawling she-thing my own hair and teeth and flesh and tissue will just liquify to green and melt away. Mayhap how she came to be in such a condition. 

He didn't like to look at her but he needed her so he kept behind her, the witch-woman Maab and he followed her to the pulling place. Time womb. 

Hellmouth. 

Oh God… why did I ever put you in this place…? Whatever compelled me to put you in the ground here… why did I leave you in this rotting dark place…? 

A great wail, electrical throated animal cry from somewhere in the pale. From within the white shrouded dead dark. It sounded both desperate animal and malfunctioning failing mechanics, atonal techo-organic, a metallic KO from another obsidian world. 

Wyckoff clapped his cold sweating greasy palms, filthied, to his ears and cried back in response. Begging it to stop. Maab the witch-thing just cackled her snapping shrubbery laughter and urged the fragile man forward. 

He went. They went on. 

…

They came to the place and she turned and regarded him then. 

She threw back the hood. Wyckoff suppressed a shriek. 

Her flesh was as melted wax. Mishapen and sculpted by a cruel hand wielded by a demented mind. Tissue as clay bubbled and erupted in scarred mutilated remnant of a woman's face. Yellow eyes gazed reptilian from within the distorted warped features of a hag-lizard, snake-bitch design. 

Someone had tried to burn her before. Someone had tried to burn this witch once already. Someone had put her to the stake. 

Yet here she stood. 

She thrummed with power. Wyckoff could feel it. They stood over the cold lonely grave of his Paula. She'd said it was perfect. It was right next to the bastard womb. It was right beside the cradle of filth that was a womb of light only shrouded in shadow. She would show him. 

He would see. 

He brought forth the knapsack at her instruction. The small creature inside had ceased struggling in the journey through this sour bastard land. But as he raised it before them both, the cat inside must've sensed their terrible intent for it renewed its thrashings and yowling. Reinvigorated. Revived. Brought to life. 

Maab spoke. Wyckoff nodded. Brought forth the great blade. 

It was a large hunting knife. Beautiful. Ornate handle with a sparrow in flight with a sprig of fig leaf in its beak carved into the handle by Paula's father. For the wedding. A gift. So long ago. 

She laughed at him and told him to stop dawdling. And laughed at him again. Her dry cackles the dead cracking rustles of little animal bones jostled in the killing den of the black nest. 

He attempted to pray. To God. For forgiveness. 

She yelled. Scorned. She told the little fool that the Jew God had no power over this blind land. Some places spoiled and were lost to the other side. Enemy territory, she called it. And smiled a sliming black smile. It wet the dry leather of her lips to a dripping ebon-green. She stretched out her thin skeletal-goblin arms and splayed out her claws. 

Begin then, bade the witch. 

He did. 

Holding the struggling small satchel aloft over the grave of his lost love, he plunged the long hunting blade into the pregnant teardrop bulge filled with feline life and stilled the beast. 

The blood, warm, flowed. 

Spilled. Onto the grave. 

The warm blood flowed forth and Maab began to sing-speak. Throat-screech bastard tongue and black words that were eons old when the Earth was virginal and new. 

Wyckoff held the bleeding thing where it was and let it pour onto the terrible land that held his Paula prisoner. He let the earth drink so that she may be once more set free. 

please give her back to me…

At first nothing … …

A beat …

But then the blood, thick and growing darker in color like pitch, began to pool about the wretched little grave. Unnaturally. Accumulating and growing in an abundance that was not in sensible correlation with what flowed forth from the small dead beast in satchel and into the growing pool. 

It began to dance. The surface of blood. With little ripples that suggested movement. Life. Something moved beneath its surface. Something was alive inside.

Wyckoff began to sweat despite the cold. His eyes were wide in a bulge and unbelieving. His visage was all a mask of greasy grimey flesh and desperate gazing eyes. Wide. Wide as the whole Earth. 

It began to emerge. And Maab began to laugh. 

And sing.

Naked. She dripped with thick ichor. Hair matted down in a blanket mass. Her breasts and figure more plump and ample than before in life. Lips full, generous mouth slitted in a smirk. Her eyes were ghostly aglow with mischievous light. 

Wyckoff saw all of this and none of this. His wide eyes never blinked. Paula…

Her smirk grew wider to a grin and the grin grew teeth. 

She raised her bare arms to him and held them out and open. Come. Come into them. Come to me. 

Wyckoff obeyed the gesture without hesitation. 

Within her arms he knew he made a mistake. It was cold. Colder than the earth. As ice of the Scandinavian warrior's hell. He tried to pull away immediately but found she was endowed with terrible strength. He struggled a moment, dread and worry and not comprehending what was happening even as it occurred trap-like all around him. 

He looked up into her face then. The thing that should be Paula but wasn't. 

The visage had begun to crack. The mask had begun to deteriorate. The pores first deepened and filled with coagulant and filth and then began to squirt and spray out like rancid milk and cheese. The eyes suddenly burst into flame and began to roast within the failing skull as the once immaculate face and flesh of his beloved Paula began to slough away. 

It fell to the cursed earth with a slop. What was behind the mask was a dreadful mess, a wild chaos set of eyes and teeth and mandibles and tendrilic hissing things of the color pink.  

Maab howled laughter and discarded her robe. She too was naked beneath. 

Her misshapen flesh and goblin-woman form began to shift and change as the scar-tissue of her ravaged form began to undulate and dance and manipulate. 

Bones snapped as she grew taller. Twice. Twice her height. Cracking could be heard in tandem with Wyckoff’s desperate screaming amongst the rolling white clouds of fog and the sour damp stones of the cemetery graves. 

Fur. It grew wild and patchy and all over. But inconsistent. Like a sick animal that should be dead from pestilence but isn't because it is the devil's harbinger. 

Her face stretched and these bones snapped too but Maab just laughed. Loving it. Loving all of this. She always loved to take this shape. 

Horns erupted from wiry dry witch hair that was more straw from the floor of a barn than anything alive. They were coated in something that had once been human blood but now was the noxious color and odor of seaweed. 

Her eyes changed color and composition. Pupils swirled like milk within a cup of coffee into blasphemous cross shapes. Terrible black Xs that were the universal shape and character that was the symbol for death. Death. 

She grew a beard upon her long misshapen chin of scarred ancient flesh. She stroked it as she watched the thing take the shrieking Wyckoff. He was begging it to stop. 

Please. He filled the cemetery, the sky, the heavens. He filled the entire world and universe in encompass with his desperate throated pleas. 

Maab the goatwitch did not answer him. She'd already given him what he wanted. Now she was taking her part. It was all just the natural order. 

The natural order of things. 

Maab belted cruel strange animal laughter into the sky in duet tandem with Wyckoff and his desperate caterwauls of mind-flaying insanity. They filled the sky together and the day never came to be.

I just got frustrated. I was paying for like 3 different AI video subscriptions, burning through credits, and still not getting what I wanted. So I did what any reasonable developer would do - I spent way more time building my own thing than I would've ever spent on subscriptions.

But hey, I learned a ton about shipping a SaaS-like product, and some of it might actually be useful to you.

# The market gap that got me started

So faceless video is huge right now. If you haven't seen it - it's those short vertical videos on TikTok/YouTube Shorts where nobody appears on camera. Horror stories, news digests, fact videos, that kind of stuff.

The demand is insane. One video I generated hit **90K views** on TikTok. And I'm not even a content creator - it was just a test video.

But every tool in this space is a subscription SaaS. $20–50/mo minimum. And they all have the same problem: you're locked into their pipeline, their models, their templates. Want to change the image provider? Too bad. Want to run it locally? Nope. Want to generate in 7 languages at once? Pay 7x.

I looked at the competitive landscape - Revid.ai, Faceless.video, AutoShorts.ai, Fliki, InVideo, Pictory, etc. - and noticed something interesting: **not a single one is open-source, and not a single one lets you self-host.** Every single player is a closed SaaS.

That felt like a gap worth filling. So I built YumCut and open-sourced it.

# Architecture decisions

This was the single most important decision. Instead of building a monolith where everything is tightly coupled, I made every processing step a separate utility. Image generation, doodling effects, video assembly - each one is a standalone script that takes input and returns output.

Why this matters:

* **Swappable providers** \- user wants a different image API? They write a small script. Done.
* **AI-agent friendly** \- when I switched to using Codex for development, this architecture meant the AI could work on one utility without breaking others
* **Language agnostic** \- core utils are TypeScript, but you could plug in Python, Go, whatever

I'm not sure what to call this pattern exactly - pipeline-based? Plugin architecture? Whatever it is, it saved the project.

All video assembly happens through dynamically generated FFmpeg commands. Transitions, effects, overlays - everything. No proprietary video processing, no heavy dependencies. Just FFmpeg.

This sounds straightforward until you hit edge cases. Like transparent video overlays.

# The rabbit holes nobody warns you about

I wanted overlays - transparent videos layered on top of the main video to make it feel alive. Simple concept, right?

Turns out most codecs that support alpha channels store video in absurdly large formats. **One minute of overlay = 1GB+.** That's not gonna work when you're generating hundreds of videos.

I ended up using WebM with VP9 - modern, open, supports transparency. But getting FFmpeg to encode it properly took way longer than I'd like to admit. One of those things where you think it'll take an afternoon and it takes a week.

# The doodling effect

I built this effect that simulates an image being drawn - extract contours, convert to SVG, animate the paths appearing. The video with this effect got 90K views, so clearly it resonates.

But here's the thing - existing services charge per-image for this effect, roughly the same price as generating the image itself. Making it work with open-source tools only, with no paid APIs, was a significant chunk of work. Contour extraction, SVG conversion, animation timing - lots of fiddling.

# Multi-language TTS is harder than you think

English TTS? Solved problem. Plenty of good local models.

But I needed 7 languages (English, Russian, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian). And a voice that sounds great in English will sound robotic in Spanish. Every language needs its own voice configuration.

I started with ElevenLabs (subscription, use-it-or-lose-it monthly quota - annoying model btw). Tried local models (quality issues with non-English). Eventually landed on budget cloud options like Minimax and InWorld that support voice cloning across languages.

The lesson: **multilingual anything adds 3-5x complexity.** If you're building a SaaS and thinking ""we'll add more languages later"" - budget way more time than you think.

# How AI agents built most of this

I started building in Cursor with Claude. It worked, but it was like pair programming with someone who drank 10 cups of coffee. I'd ask for one feature and get three - two of which were broken. Constant cleanup.

The tight coupling problem was real. ""Fix this function"" and suddenly three other files are modified with unnecessary refactors.

# Codex: the focused senior dev

Switching to OpenAI Codex was a game changer. It does what you ask, nothing more. Changing one part of the project stopped being scary because Codex wouldn't randomly touch other parts.

# The lesson for SaaS builders

If you're using AI agents for development, architecture matters more than ever. The pluggable utility pattern I chose wasn't just good engineering - it was essential for AI-assisted development. Isolated components = AI agents that don't break your stuff.

# Competitive landscape and positioning

Here's the thing about this market: **every competitor is a closed SaaS with no self-hosting option.**

|Open Source|Self-hosted|Custom templates|Character consistency|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**YumCut**|✅|✅|✅|
|revid.ai|❌|❌|❌|
|Faceless.video|❌|❌|Limited|
|AutoShorts.ai|❌|❌|Limited|
|Creatify|❌|❌|✅|
|InVideo AI|❌|❌|✅|
|Fliki.ai|❌|❌|✅|
|Pictory|❌|❌|✅|

I'm not saying open-source is always the right play. But in a market where every single player is a $30/mo subscription doing roughly the same thing - being the open-source alternative is a real differentiator.

The online version offers 3 free video generations. Locally, it's unlimited.

# Licensing: the middle ground

Current license: free for personal use, contact me for commercial deployment as a service. I'm considering relaxing this to fully open depending on community demand.

Honestly still figuring out the right approach here. If you've navigated open-source licensing for a product like this, I'd love to hear what worked.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

At first, it was quite difficult because we were extremely new to this baby thing and he would end up screaming while we were scrambling to make a bottle lol. It’s gotten a bit better now. Yesterday, we had a great day. We went to the beach, he didn’t scream once, we took lovely pictures, had coffee and he happily got strolled around the boardwalk.

Today, however wasn’t so great. We went to meet some distant family friends for lunch and despite being fed before leaving home, baby started being fussy at the table and I ended up feeding him again right there. Turns out, he just took a giant poop. He didn’t take to strangers and cried when they tried to hold him. Later, the baby room was full, I couldn’t find a place to sit down and feed him and the crowds were making all of us overstimulated. He also cried in his car seat on the way home, which he almost never does.

My question is, how not to get discouraged by the bad days?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

For me, sugar cookies were always hit-or-miss: sometimes dry, sometimes too cakey, sometimes they spread into weird little puddles.

Then I tried **Amish Sugar Cookies: The Soft, Classic Cookie You’ll Bake on Repeat**, and it’s basically become my “default cookie” when I want something easy that makes the house smell amazing. The texture is the main win: soft, tender, and still cookie-like (not biscuit-y). They’re the kind of cookie that feels right with coffee, tea, or just standing in the kitchen grabbing one “to test.” 😅

What I liked about **Amish Sugar Cookies: The Soft, Classic Cookie You’ll Bake on Repeat** is that it’s simple and forgiving. No fancy steps, no complicated chilling schedule (unless you want to), and it doesn’t rely on frosting or sprinkles to taste good. It’s that classic, slightly sweet, buttery thing that just works.

A few little things I noticed while baking:

* Don’t overbake. The moment they look “done-done,” they’ll cool down more firm than you want. Pulling them when they’re just set keeps them soft.
* Even cookie sizes matter. My random scoops baked unevenly—once I scooped consistently, the softness was way more reliable.
* They’re amazing the next day. Somehow the texture gets even better after they sit overnight in a container.

If you want the exact ingredient list + steps I used, here it is: [**Amish Sugar Cookies: The Soft, Classic Cookie You’ll Bake on Repeat**](https://offgriddailylife.com/amish-sugar-cookies-soft-recipe/). I’ve already made them twice and I’m planning to keep them in rotation for potlucks and “I need something sweet but not complicated” moments.

What’s your preference for sugar cookies—super soft and pillowy, or slightly crisp edges—and do you add anything (lemon zest, vanilla, almond extract) to make yours stand out?

I am in a small department with just me and my manager (52M). Let’s call him Will. We get along very well and are now good friends. We have an excellent work relationship and a good friendship; he is a very chill manager and trusts me a lot. Will is also an anxious person, easily affected by the weather or small things. He has a past trauma from when his dad died of a genetic disease (he was 30). He was very traumatized by how his dad died (euthanasia is not allowed in my country). Will dealt with his grief and trauma on his own, with meditation, tree hugging therapy, shiatsu, hiking, enjoying the nature, etc. so he never went to therapy.

Over the years, Will told me he has found his own ways of dealing with his anxiety and traumas. Until recently, when he was anxious or stressed at work, I have always managed to steer him away from his thoughts, cheer him up, and change the topic. It was only happening from time to time, and usually he would take an afternoon off to take care of himself (go for a hike, go to a spa, etc.) and then he would be ok.

However, he is now going through a very difficult time. A very good friend of Will has been diagnosed with cancer, stage 4. His friend’s state dramatically worsened in a matter of 3 weeks, nothing is certain, but his friend’s prognosis is really bad (3 to 4 months). Will is the godfather of his friend’s daughter (whom he is very close). He is obviously very affected by the situation and is helping his friend’s wife and daughter a lot, dealing with hospital visits, calling regularly to check in, inviting over his friend’s daughter (she’s extremely distraught, crying a lot, which is devastating for Will). And unfortunately, this whole situation brought back Will’s past trauma with his dad’s death. 

I am trying my best to help him, support him, listen to him. I’ve tried to advise him to seek professional support such as a therapist so he can talk about his fears and feelings, and help him navigate this difficult time, but he considers he doesn’t need it, as he has managed to deal with his grief before using his own methods and alternative medicine/practices. And he doesn't really believe in therapy's benefits for himself.

At work, we usually take coffee breaks in the morning and afternoon and he only talks abt that. I reassure him, I let him talk, I give advice, etc. I try to find a balance by not changing the topic to make him think of other stuff, I talk about lighter topics to lighten up the mood, but he always ends up back on it, even though he keeps saying he needs to think about something else. When we are at our respective computer, I can hear him sight. The way he talks, I can feel and sense his sadness and stress. 

The accumulation of all this is starting to be too much for me. I consider myself lucky, as I have a pretty good and stable mental state. I have a close-knit family and a very good support system, but I’m also extremely empathetic. I get emotional listening to people talking abt their pain, I cry easily for the pain of others, which makes it sometimes difficult to support someone as it affects me too. But I try my best to keep a straight face when a friend is going through something difficult.

I know he is going through something very difficult, but dealing every day with his mental state is taxing. Before his current situation, it was already a bit annoying when he kept complaining about stuff, but now it’s worse and I have no idea how I can gently tell him that his negativity is affecting me too. If he was just a friend from outside, I would not say anything and support him, but we are working closely together so I’m basically with him from Monday to Friday, 8 to 5.

Considering the situation is going to stay, I just don't want to go to office everyday knowing he will only talk about this.

How could I tell him I am here for him, but that I also have my own limits and that if he needs to talk, he needs to seek professional help, because there is so much I can handle.",1,1771500448.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

1r8wpwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1r8wpwz/if_i_couldnt_handle_working_in_a_daycare_should_i/,"If I couldn't handle working in a daycare, should I avoid having kids?","(not a native english speaker so some wordings might be off!)

I'm at the moment studying to become a daycare teacher, and I just recently had my first internship as a part of my education (there'll be more studies and internships in the future) and I found out something... Concerning. My real life experience of kids has been just having a calm little sibling growing up and occasionally being a voluntary ""big sister"" to the neighbour's daughter. I've studied child psychology and pedagogics and things relating to that before the I started studying with the intention of ""I'll be the best mom who'll do things that support my kid's development"".

I used to study to become a chemistry teacher before I got into an accident that made me unable to continue studying it (I'm back at middle school what comes to my math and natural science skill yay) and gave me chronic pain.

The internship lasted for 4 weeks. I worked either less than 5 days but 8hr days per week or 5 days but 6 hr days, so I didn't even get to the 8hrs 5 days a week. 

There was 14 kids, all independent to a point where they didn't need help with basic things like eating, using the bathroom and so on. Maybe occasionally helping with putting on and off outdoor clothes. Other workers said they were very calm compared to others.

Normally it would have taken me over a month of high intensity work (as in when I worked as a security guard and in a call center) before I started getting intrusive flashbacks about things that happened during the day, but in this job, it took less than two weeks. By the end I couldn't sleep and any days in between work I would just lay down in bed and not even eat. My baby fever immediately vanished after years of being convinced that I wanted nothing but having kids in life and being jealous of teen mothers because they ""already got to have the best thing on earth while I have to get a college degree and a good job just to be able to seriously think about it"".

I like the IDEA of kids and the idea of teaching them new stuff about the world. I like the idea of not being the reason my bloodline ends, considering how much work my mother has had to do just to have me (I'm an IVF baby, and my siblings aren't going to have kids, that's certain). I feel like what I actually want is more of an animated cute doll that never has a dirty diaper that I can buy cute baby clothes for and that responds and reacts back to me in a positive way. I want the pressure of having to continue the family line or having kids and being a procreating citizen that won't have to face the constant external conflict of ""you're supposed to have kids, why aren't you doing it?"" 

I know having kids would mean I'd also subscribe to potentially being a single mother because I can't control if my partner leaves me, dies or something else similar happens. I don't have a support network nor do I have the skills to build one. I want connection and love and I've been sold that kids are a way for women to get it, but is it possible to find a those in similar depths elsewhere?

I feel like it's impossible or incredibly unlikely I'll find a man who I'd want as a friend, husband, lover AND father of my children. I'm on the greysexual spectrum which means that the partner has to look  a certain way and have a specific kind of a personality and way of living. Otherwise I'd be repulsed with just the idea of being physically very close or sexual with them so it's likely that I won't even find anyone in time before it's too late. I think I'll only end up secretly resent parenting if everything was on my shoulders and I had no one else to ask for help.

But is having kids still worth it? Would it be a good idea to donate my egg cells so someone else could hopefully have kids even if I don't end up having them? I'm leaning towards not having kids, but it could be just because my social media keeps showing me videos of things like kids smearing poop all over the walls, parents finding you cars in their coffee, kids breaking expensive things, kids biting and hurting others and kids throwing tantrums in the worst times possible. Are those a common things with kids? Are kids that are your own really that much different from taking care of other people's kids?

My mother can't tell me anything about this because she genuinely can't remember anything except my favourite movie when I was a kid after she got a brain injury and I don't know anyone else/ have anyone else that's alive that I could ask about these things.

Tldr: if being a daycare worker is too much work, should I even have kids of my own? Is it REALLY that different to have your own kids compared to taking care of other people's kids?",3,1771500215.0,AskWomenOver30,17,0.67,False

It supports 30+ grinders (Comandante, 1Zpresso, Timemore, Fellow, Baratza, etc.) and V60, Chemex, and AeroPress. You pick your setup, it gives you a starting point and a timed pour plan.

You can add any grinder you want!

A few things it does:

\- Grind recommendation adjusted for roast + origin + process

\- Step-by-step pour plan with a built-in timer

\- Works offline as a PWA — no account needed

\- You can scan your coffee bag to auto-fill bean details

\- Brew history and rating if you do sign up

It's free, no ads, no paywall. I just wanted something I'd actually use while brewing. This is not self promotion. I just wanna share something cool with the community

 

Would appreciate any feedback — especially if your grinder is missing or a recommendation feels off.

1r8wot8,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetPaidToPlay/comments/1r8wot8/nuggmi_ptc_gpt_mining_simulator/,NUGGMI - PTC - GPT - Mining Simulator,"Hey everyone,

I recently stumbled across a brand-new faucet/mining-style platform called **Nuggmi**, and since it’s still very early, I figured it might be worth sharing.

The concept is pretty straightforward:

You purchase tools → the tools automatically generate nuggets over time → you collect the nuggets → upgrade and repeat.

Those nuggets can then be converted and withdrawn as crypto (BTC, ETH, SOL, USDT, etc.).

It just launched recently and still feels like it’s in its early growth phase, which can sometimes be the best time to try something like this. I actually found it randomly while browsing ads, and it brought back that old-school faucet vibe that’s hard to find nowadays.

**So far, here’s what stands out:**

* Simple, clean interface (no annoying pop-up overload)
* Progression feels reasonable, not painfully slow
* No aggressive push to deposit money
* Includes PTC ads, tasks, and the mining system
* Offerwalls and surveys are supposedly coming soon

Of course, it’s too early to judge long-term sustainability. The real test will be how competitive the offerwalls and rewards turn out to be once everything is fully implemented.

I’m planning to test it for a few weeks and see how it develops. Not saying it’s a guaranteed win — just sharing something new that might turn into a decent side earner.

Is it life-changing money? Definitely not. More like small side earnings — think coffee money, not rent money. Keep expectations realistic.

There’s currently a 1000 nugget ($0.10) signup bonus.

If you want to check it out:

AMA,"Originally, I planned to write a lengthy post on the topic since I want to help any who are currently experiencing something similar as I did. That said, it would be way too long and I thought it would be better if I could answer your questions on an individual basis.

Essentially, in late August of last year I took 0.5mg of Ativan daily for 7 days straight to help with my insomnia induced by coffee withdrawal. I had no knowledge about benzos whatsoever and the doctor prescribed it to me without explaining anything about the medication. However, I started developing strange symptoms during the week I was on Ativan. Moreover, I went cold turkey without realizing I went cold turkey when I stopped taking the Ativan on the seventh day. What ensued were a bunch of symptoms that were caused by the Ativan after I abruptly stopped the medication.

Since December 13th, I've begun to show signs of healing. I'm still experiencing some symptoms, but I think I am 70% healed.

I want you to know that this sort of thing is possible. It's rare and I don't care what the naysayers say (e.g. ""it's just anxiety and it's all in your head""), but you can absolutely indeed experience benzo withdrawal with only a small amount and being on it for a short duration. I don't know why exactly. It could be because of genetic predisposition, but it can certainly happen.

I can answer questions relating to:

– Progression of the symptoms  
– Which symptoms started to fade away first  
– Current symptoms  
– Etc.

Symptoms included:

– Loss of appetite/satiety  
– Cessation of stomach rumbling  
– Insomnia (e.g. 2 weeks of total insomnia followed by broken sleep at various stages)  
– Vivid dreams during sleep  
– Hypnagogic hallucination during nap

– Hypnic jerks at sleep onset

I was walking around acting calm like I had life figured out. Then I opened my bank app two days later and I swear my soul left my body. It was gone. Not all of it, but enough that I just stared at the screen like it was a magic trick. I blinked and I closed the app and opened it again like it was going to fix itself. It did not fix itself. The money was not hiding. It was just… spent. And the worst part is I could not even tell you on what, because it did not feel like I bought anything big.

That is what makes it funny and sad at the same time. If I bought a television or a new phone, at least I could point at it and be like there is my money, sitting on the table. But no, it was the invisible stuff. It was me being tired, me being lazy, me wanting a little reward, me saying it is just a small thing. It was the snacks, the random store runs, the extra delivery fees, the coffee, the late fee because I forgot the due date, the subscription that I do not even use, the little online order because I was bored, the gas station drink because I did not plan ahead. It was like my paycheck got broken into tiny pieces and handed out to nonsense. I was basically donating money to companies that do not care if I eat or not.

I had this moment where I felt embarrassed, because I am a grown man and I am still getting surprised by my own spending like I am new here. And I started doing this thing where I blame everything else. I blame prices, I blame the world, I blame bad luck. But if I am being honest, a lot of it is me not paying attention. I do not track, I do not plan, I do not set rules, then I act shocked when the month punches me. It is like I keep stepping on the same rake and then getting mad at the rake. I realized I do not have a money problem only. I have a habit problem. And habits are sneaky because they feel small until they stack up and become your whole life.

So I did something that felt boring but it saved me from staying confused. I looked at my bank history for the last month like I was investigating my own life. I did not do it to shame myself, I did it because I was tired of being broke and not even knowing why. I wrote down the top five things that were draining me. Not everything, just the main ones. Food delivery, random snacks, subscriptions, late fees, and the little shopping orders. Then I made it simple because I know myself. If I make it complicated, I will quit in two days. I set one rule for each leak. If I want delivery, I only do it on one day. If I want snacks, I buy them once for the week, not every time I am out. If I have a subscription, I either use it or cancel it. If a bill has a due date, it goes in my phone with reminders. If I want to buy something online, I wait a day first. It is not perfect, but it is real.

The emotional part is this. When your paycheck disappears, it makes you feel like you are failing at life, even if you are working hard. It messes with your confidence. You start thinking you will never get ahead, you will never build anything, you will always be stuck stressing about money. And that stress makes you spend more because you want relief. Then you are trapped in this loop where you work, you spend, you regret, you promise to change, then you do it again. That loop is exhausting. It makes you feel alone too, because everybody acts like they have it together, and you are sitting there refreshing your bank app like a maniac.

I am still not some perfect saver. But I am trying to stop the bleeding first, because that is the real issue. I do not need to become a different person overnight. I just need to stop acting like small spending does not count. It counts. It counts every single time. And if you are like me and you keep blinking and your paycheck is gone, do yourself one favor. Look at the last thirty days and find your top three leaks. Then put one simple rule on each leak. Not a huge plan. Just one rule. That is how you start taking control back without hating your life.

Even my friends who visit have comments on how it gives a certain calm. This is probably one of many renovations I will be doing here. The fact that it's not the biggest apartment does not mean it has to be the dullest one, I am open to suggestions too.",2,1771498955.0,UrbanGardening,0,1.0,False

1r8wcnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/PMPTest/comments/1r8wcnq/obtained_pgmp_in_2nd_attempt_oct25/,Obtained PgMP in 2nd attempt - Oct-25,"Hi guys,

I made a Reddit account just to share my experience. It is correct that there isn't much literature available on PgMP and anything that could help others must be appreciated. I will be concise.

**If you're Struggling with your online exams, class, assignment/homework or any other task, Contact Us for Help:** 

**Website: hiraedu. com** 

**WhatsApp: +16124914941**

**Call: +12136359834**

**Experience**

I just finished four years as Program Manager. Prior to this, I have three years as Project Manager. I have a PMP I obtained in 2020.

**Application**

The application process was fairly straight-forward. I didn't wait - PgMP has been on my radar for over a year and I had been impatient for the day I qualify for the application. I had no idea about the resources: I filled in the form and gave quite vague answers to the personal experience questions. I was not aware the same is used by the panel to review applications. My thoughts were that this was the first PMI check, and a panel discussion would appear later. As expected, the panel objected and I reach out to a PgMP certified friend to understand the process. I then formatted the same experience and response to questions in a more *PMI-compliant* vocabulary to get it sorted. Apparently, we need to add more of *I did this* not *We did this* although I feel I am incomplete without my fantastic team.

**Preparation**

There was an opportunity for a Sr. Program Manager in my organization that I was looking forward to. I wanted to get the PgMP credential to align myself for it as soon as I could. I scheduled my exam within a month of this. My initial preparation material was the PMI book and course videos of IBM on Coursera. I passed the full-length mock exam in the first go with 84% score. I felt confident.

10 days before the exam I realized I should probably invest in more mocks. No brainer, except you cannot find much. This forum landed me on iZenbridge's youtube channel: the videos looked reasonable, so I went to their platform. Apparently there isn't an option to purchase full-length mock exams - I ended up with the full training + mock exams. I went through the training videos once and practiced *some* exams. Scored less than 80% but I didn't think much of it.

**Exam 1**

The exam was NOT easy. The grammar is AWFUL. I don't care who writes the questions, I wonder who APPROVES them. Honestly, they could do better English. Anyway, I continued with the exam and finished in 2.5 hours. I had flagged about 35 questions, reviewed at the end, but did NOT feel confident while submitting. I knew if I had passed, it would be with only the tiniest margins. I didn't, and I felt I didn't deserve to.

**My scores:**

Strategic Program Management: Below Target  
Program Lifecycle: Target  
Benefits Management: Target  
Stakeholder Management: Below Target  
Governance: Needs Improvement

I went through the PMI score report and compared the detailed analysis with the ECO. The result was obvious: I was overconfident with the Governance domain as this is something I perform in my job role the most. I did not study from the PMI standards and got all except 2 wrong. It was a good self reflection. I immediately booked my next exam, only available after a month, and made a retake preparation plan.

**Retake Preparation**

I knew where I went wrong. I focused most on Governance, followed by Strategic Alignment, and them some with the other domains. I went through the ECO and the PMI PgMP resource book. I also focused on iZenbridge's training videos in these domains. Then, I went through the short practice exams, improved my scores (96% in Governance) and learnt the root cause for the questions I got wrong. I took only one full-length mock again.

**Exam 2**

Unlike the last time, this exam went easy. It was confidence. However, the three key differences in approach relative to previous exam:

\- No last-minute prep. It only confuses me in my opinion. The exam is about understanding the principles.  
\- Hydration and energy: I was practically parched and hence drowsy in the previous exam! I ensured to get more than a good night's sleep and a lot of hydration. It helped me focus.  
\- Breaks: The exam does not have prescribed break time. It doesn't mean you cannot take any. I took a 2-minute toilet break at 100-question mark and then took another one after finishing all 170 questions.

Overall, the exam went really well from the start. I was able to get all questions done in two hours or so. I had flagged a little over 60 questions. Rest were all obvious and didn't warrant more than 45 seconds. I had way more flags at the end I reckon. Barely 5 questions were repeat from the previous exam - I expected more. Key qualifiers are certainly important; the body brief of the question would paint a picture however the question could ask you something that's independent to throw you off. For example, it can narrate a story about a program risk management plan and then ask you how do you make a stakeholder register. This is an example only, of course. What to do first, next, best - these are important.

My game changer was this: a brief 10-minute break at 170-completed questions. I left the examination area and went for a stretch. Sat at the bench and was lucky to find coffee there. Took some sips nice and easy, refreshed and energized myself, then went back to review my flagged submissions. I ended up changing between 25-30 of the 60 flags. Why? Because the refreshed mind and the experience from other questions made it easier to focus on the obvious. Staying at something you are stuck for 2 minutes wouldn't help you: come back again with a fresh perspective.

The result was all Targets. A little sad as I hoped for at least two Above Targets. But at the end of the day, a valid PgMP is a PgMP.

Appreciation to iZenbridge guy no doubt. I will be recommending him to my colleagues. Have any questions? Shoot and I will try to answer.

Cheers.

1r8wazh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r8wazh,Full Ascended Heroes Kmart Stock List for 20th Feb Release,"Thank you all for your patience on this - but here it is in all it's glory, the full stock list for tomorrow's release of the Ascended ETB, Mini Tin and 2-Pack.

  
Some Q&A for you so I don't have to answer the questions you will have:

  
**Why is my store not there?** Could either be because it isn't scanned in yet or that they aren't receiving it. I can't give you an exact answer.

  
**Why is my store so low for stock?** Kmart distributed it that way - I don't know.

  
**Will I need to line up to get stock?** Depends on what store you plan on going to. Lower stocked stores yes, higher stock probably not - there's a lot of Kmart's around so people will be spread around.

  
**Will more stock be added overnight?** Probably - but I can't be sure.

  
**Why does Victoria have so much stock?** Idk. Their coffee costs far too much so maybe it's Kmart's way of feeling sorry for them.

  
**Will 24 hour Kmart's sell from midnight?** Probably, yes. They have historically so no reason to change it now.

  
As I said in my post earlier this week - **we are so back. WE ARE SO BACK.** We haven't seen stock like this for a long time - and keep in mind that this is one of four major retailers that will stock this product tomorrow so this is astronomical. As always, we are providing this information free of charge and will maintain this as we want the product to go into the hands of good people.

  
**We are not resellers. We are not trying to encourage scalping. We are against it and will always be.** 

  
Don't mean to sound like a dick - but if you ask one of the questions that are answered above we won't respond. Please make sure you read the post and the numbers / stores well so you can get a proper understanding of what's happening and where you'll be successful.

  
Good luck to everyone tomorrow, we can't wait to see the stock wins and the pulls!

1r8w9lu,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1r8w9lu/should_i_try_to_invite_my_coworker_for_lunch/,Should I try to invite my coworker for lunch,"I (24F) really would like to know my coworker (30M) better. We are in the same department, but we no longer work in the same project, and we usually work remote.

I've never felt this feeling before and I feel that if I don't try, I might lose my person.

I'm confident to assume he likes me at least in a friendly way, since we have exchanged social media so we don't have to talk on teams about non related work stuff, we have quite a couple things in common (same hobby), and we are able to vent to each other.

Now, we are both introverts, and I'm not sure if he will ever try to invite me to do something on the weekends (we work pretty much remote, so it's hard to just ask to grab a coffee or drinks after work). He might also be afraid of trying something, because of the age gap/same company.

So, is it weird if it's me trying something first? I'm absolutely terrified by the idea of him rejecting me/the lunch offer, since it would be on the weekend and maybe too personal. On the other hand, him rejecting it would put an end to this mess in my head...and would make me move on.

Nothing dramatic happened. No big announcement. No milestone. But I caught myself sitting quietly this morning, coffee in hand, and realizing something: I’m still here. After everything.

There were nights I didn’t think I’d make it through. Days where I felt invisible. Times when I doubted my own strength so much it scared me. And yet somehow, piece by piece, I kept going. Even when I was tired. Even when I wanted to quit.

I’m grateful for the version of me that refused to give up, for the people who stayed when I felt hard to love and for the small wins no one else saw.

Maybe it’s not a big miracle. But surviving quietly? Growing slowly? Healing without applause?

I am"," a man who finds as much resonance in a Byron soliloquy as I do in a heavy session at the gym. My interests are broad ...from the complexities of Indian federalism and history to the raw, amateur soul of making music. I’m looking for a woman who is my intellectual and emotional equal, someone I can vibe with over Bengali poetry or fitness goals.

I am a composed man in my public life, but I believe that a truly deep connection should be built on absolute honesty and a bit of a bittersweet edge. I’m looking for a slow-burn, ""friends-to-lovers"" journey where our bond is the anchor for everything else we explore.

The Connection:

I’ve always felt that the most intense relationships are those where there is a certain level of vulnerability and uninhibited trust. I want to be the man who truly knows your heart...the one you share your day with, your music with, and your secrets with. I am drawn to the complex, intense dynamic of cuckolding, where I am your primary partner and sanctuary, yet find a visceral, possessive thrill in seeing you explore your desires with others. I want to be the one who welcomes you back, hears the details, and shows you exactly why I’m the one you chose to keep.

What I’m Looking For:
Intellectual Spark: Someone to discuss Manfred in the morning or debate politics over coffee.
Shared Growth: Whether it's gym progress or dabbling in new poetry, I want to grow alongside you.
Emotional Depth: I value the bittersweet feeling of being the one you always come home to. I want to be the person who hears everything about your experiences and loves you more for it.

I’m a ""winner"" in my public life, but I want to be the one who listens and understands you in private. If you’re a woman who isn't afraid to be herself and wants a partner who can match your mind and your spirit, I’d love to connect.

Turns out it’s *really* easy to make a smoothie that tastes healthy but is basically liquid sugar. Once I started building **Low-Carb Keto-Friendly Weight Loss Smoothies** the right way, they became one of the easiest tools in my routine—especially on busy mornings.

For me, the big shift was treating **Low-Carb Keto-Friendly Weight Loss Smoothies** like a macro-friendly meal: protein + fat + fiber, and keeping the sweet stuff controlled. I still want it to taste good, but I don’t want the “hunger rebound” an hour later.

My basic formula for **Low-Carb Keto-Friendly Weight Loss Smoothies**:

* **Protein:** whey isolate or a low-carb plant protein (check labels), or Greek yogurt if it fits your carbs
* **Fat:** avocado, nut butter (measured), coconut cream, or MCT (if you tolerate it)
* **Fiber + volume:** chia/flax, psyllium (small amount), spinach, or frozen zucchini/cauliflower (sounds weird, works)
* **Flavor without sugar:** cocoa, cinnamon, vanilla, coffee, and a low-carb sweetener if you use one
* **Fruit (optional):** small serving of berries only—this is where I used to mess up

A couple practical tips that saved me:

* If it’s not thick, I’d rather add frozen zucchini than more fruit.
* Measure nut butter. It’s amazing how fast “a spoon” turns into a calorie bomb.
* Salt matters! A tiny pinch makes chocolate/vanilla flavors pop and can help post-workout.

Question for the keto/low-carb folks: what’s your go-to smoothie thickener—avocado, chia, coconut cream, or something else?

Not consciously. I just… stopped. Stopped testing the front door to see if it was locked. Stopped calculating escape routes. Stopped lying awake at night planning how I'd get out if things went sideways.

Somewhere between fixing the third-floor bathroom sink and explaining to Isla why you couldn't microwave metal (apparently that was news to someone who'd lived through the invention of the microwave), this had become normal.

My normal, anyway.

I'd established a routine. Wake up at seven. Coffee—I'd gotten very good at the espresso machine, good enough that even Carmilla complimented it once in her own way: ""This is acceptable"". Breakfast. Check the list of repairs Thomas had left incomplete—the man had been thorough, but one hundred and forty three year-old thorough had its limits. Work until noon. Lunch. More work. Maybe some reading in Thomas's extensive library. Dinner. Evening with whichever sister felt like talking.

And somewhere in there, I'd started working out again.

The house had a gym. Of course it did. Third floor, corner room with floor-to-ceiling windows (blackout curtains, naturally) and enough equipment to stock a commercial fitness center. Top-of-the-line everything—squat rack, bench press, cable machines, dumbbells that went up to weights I couldn't lift on my best day, a rowing machine that looked like NASA designed it.

Thomas's gym, I assumed. Though given the dust on some of the equipment, he hadn't used it much in his later years.

I'd been going regularly for about a week, trying to rebuild the routine I'd had before everything went sideways. The vampire blood had done something to my recovery time—I could lift heavier, go longer, bounce back faster. Not superhuman, but definitely enhanced. Like someone had turned up all my body's settings by ten percent.

It felt good. Normal. Like I was taking back some control over my life, even if that life now included being a vampire's daytime handyman and occasional blood bag.

What I hadn't realized was that I had an audience.

I was mid-set on the bench press—working through my third set of eight reps, the bar loaded with more weight than I'd managed before my whole life imploded—when I caught movement in my peripheral vision.

The gym had interior windows looking out into the hallway. And in that hallway, partially obscured by the doorframe, was Isla.

Watching.

I finished the rep, racked the bar, and sat up.

""You know I can see you, right?""

She didn't have the grace to look embarrassed. Just stepped fully into the doorway, leaning against the frame with her arms crossed.

""You're stronger than you were,"" she observed.

""Vampire blood perks."" I grabbed my water bottle, took a drink. ""How long have you been watching?""

""Fifteen minutes? Maybe twenty.""

""That's not creepy at all.""

""I'm a vampire. Creepy is kind of our thing."" She moved into the room properly, examining the equipment with curiosity. ""Thomas never used this stuff. Well, not in the last twenty years anyway.""

""Yeah, I noticed. Half of it still has the factory tags.""

""Father had it installed in the nineties when Thomas mentioned wanting to stay fit. Very thoughtful of him."" She picked up a dumbbell, testing its weight. ""Do you enjoy it? The working out?""

""Yeah, actually. Clears my head. Makes me feel like I'm doing something productive.""

""As opposed to all the actual productive things you do around here?""

""Different kind of productive. This is just for me.""

Isla set down the dumbbell, studying me with those sharp green eyes. ""That's healthy. Thomas never did anything just for himself. Everything was about serving us. Taking care of us.""

""Sounds exhausting.""

""It was. Toward the end, anyway."" She sat on the bench press, right where I'd been seconds ago. ""Can I ask you something?""

""Sure.""

""Are you happy here?""

The question caught me off guard. I reached for the towel I'd draped over the squat rack, wiped sweat from my face while I considered.

""Happy is a strong word,"" I said finally. ""Content, maybe? I'm alive. I have a purpose. The work isn't bad. You guys aren't actually trying to kill me.""

""That's a pretty low bar for happiness.""

""Yeah, well. My bar got a lot lower after getting shot.""

She laughed. ""Fair point."" Then, more seriously: ""You're different than Thomas. He was devoted from the start. You're just… here. Doing the job. But not really ours.""

""Is that a problem?""

""No. I think it's better, actually. Healthier."" She stood, moved toward the door. ""Same time tomorrow? I'll try to be less obvious about watching.""

""Or you could just work out with me.""

That stopped her. ""Really?""

""Why not? You're immortal, but a good workout might do you some good and keep you fit. But being a vampire probably means you’ll kick my ass in here ""

A slow smile spread across her face. ""Okay. Yeah. I'll bring Nadya. She used to love physical activity back when she was human.""

After she left, I finished my workout with the distinct feeling I was being watched from multiple angles. When I checked the hallway on my way out, I caught Vivienne disappearing around a corner, sketch pad under her arm.

Definitely being watched.

 

I didn't think much of it until the next day when I showed up to the gym and found all five sisters waiting for me.

Seraphina was examining the rowing machine like it was an artifact from an ancient civilization. Carmilla stood by the windows, looking deeply skeptical of the entire enterprise. Nadya was stretching—actual, proper stretching, which suggested she remembered how this worked. Vivienne sat cross-legged on a yoga mat, sketching. And Isla was bouncing on her toes with barely contained energy.

""Uh,"" I said. ""Hi?""

""We're working out with you,"" Isla announced.

""I can see that.""

""Isla mentioned you invited her,"" Nadya said, a little apologetically. ""And then everyone else wanted to come.""

""I didn't want to come,"" Carmilla corrected. ""But if everyone else is here, someone needs to maintain order.""

""I'm here for artistic purposes,"" Vivienne added, not looking up from her sketch pad.

""I'm here out of anthropological curiosity,"" Seraphina said, still studying the rowing machine. ""How does this work exactly?""

I looked at them—five vampires in various athletic wear that probably cost more than my car, all staring at me expectantly—and had to fight the urge to laugh.

""Okay,"" I said. ""Okay, fine. But if we're doing this, we're doing it right. Nadya, you said you used to be active?""

""I was a dancer,"" she said. ""Ballet, before I was turned. In the 1820s.""

""And the rest of you?""

""I did acrobatics,"" Isla offered. ""Circus performer, 1770s.""

""I was a noblewoman,"" Carmilla said flatly. ""We didn't exercise. We had people for physical labor.""

""I studied art,"" Vivienne said. ""Does carrying canvases count?""

""I read books,"" Seraphina said. ""Extensively.""

""Right. So we've got two people who know how their bodies work and three who need remedial fitness education."" I clapped my hands together. ""Let's start with basics.""

The next hour was possibly the most surreal of my entire weird new existence.

Nadya took to it immediately, her dancer's muscle memory kicking in despite two hundred years of disuse. She moved through exercises with grace, barely breaking a sweat (did vampires sweat? Apparently yes, just less than humans).

Isla attacked everything with chaotic enthusiasm, doing twice as many reps as I suggested and nearly dropping a dumbbell on her foot.

Seraphina approached each exercise like a research project, asking detailed questions about muscle groups and biomechanics until Carmilla told her to ""just lift the damn weight.""

Carmilla herself was precise and controlled, performing every movement with perfect form and zero visible effort. She could probably bench press a car and not break her expression of mild disdain.

Vivienne did exactly three exercises, declared she had ""captured the essence"" of physical exertion, and went back to sketching us.

""This is ridiculous,"" Carmilla said after her second set of squats. ""We're immortal. We don't need physical fitness.""

""No, but it feels good,"" Nadya said, moving through lunges. ""I'd forgotten how good it feels to move like this.""

""Plus Dean's right,"" Isla added, doing pull-ups with alarming ease. ""It's something just for us. Not about hunting or feeding or maintaining the house. Just… being in our bodies.""

""How very modern and therapeutic,"" Carmilla said dryly. But she kept going.

By the end four of the sisters had worked up a sweat, and Vivienne had filled six pages with sketches of bodies in motion.

""Same time tomorrow?"" Isla asked hopefully.

I looked at them—vampires who'd lived for centuries, who'd seen empires rise and fall, who could kill me without thinking—doing cool-down stretches in a home gym while arguing about proper breathing techniques.

""Yeah,"" I said. ""Same time tomorrow.""

 

That evening, Dracula summoned me to his study.

I'd been in the house for three weeks and had seen him maybe four times. He was like a ghost—present but not present, aware of everything but rarely interfering. The house ran on its own, the daughters managed themselves, and Dracula existed somewhere in the background, pulling strings I couldn't see.

His study was on the second floor. . When I knocked, his voice came through immediately: ""Enter.""

The room was exactly what I expected—dark wood paneling, leather furniture, floor-to-ceiling bookshelves filled with volumes in a dozen languages. A fire burned in a large fireplace. Dracula sat behind a massive desk, reading  something on a tablet that looked absurdly modern in his hands.

""Dean,"" he said, setting the tablet aside. ""Please, sit.""

I sat in one of the leather chairs across from his desk. It was comfortable in that way experience furniture always is.

""How are you settling in?"" he asked.

""Fine. Good, actually. I've been working through Thomas's repair list. Fixed the washing machine, replaced some light fixtures, serviced the HVAC system. The house is in good shape overall.""

""Thomas was meticulous. As are you, I've noticed."" Dracula leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers. ""But that's not what I'm asking. How are you, Dean? Truly?""

I considered lying. Considered giving him the answer I thought he wanted to hear.

But something about those ancient eyes made me think he'd know.

""Honestly? I'm adapting better than I probably should be,"" I said. ""Three weeks ago, I didn't believe vampires existed. Now I'm living with six of them and it's just… normal. I work out with your daughters. I fix your appliances. I let them feed from me once a week. And it doesn't feel weird anymore.""

""And that concerns you.""

""Shouldn't it? I got shot, kidnapped by vampires, and basically told I could work for you or die. Stockholm syndrome is a thing.""

Dracula smiled faintly. ""You weren't kidnapped. You stumbled onto my doorstep, dying. We saved you and offered you employment. The alternative was death not by our hands, but by the bullet already in your body.""

""Details."" I said while waving my hand. 

""Important details."" He stood, moving to the window. The curtains were drawn—the sun had set an hour ago, but the habit remained. ""I've lived a very long time, Dean. Over six centuries. I've seen empires rise and fall, technologies that would seem like magic to my younger self become mundane. And in all that time, I've learned that humans are remarkably adaptable. You're not experiencing Stockholm syndrome. You're experiencing acceptance.""

""Of what?""

""That this is your life now. That it's not worse than your previous life. Perhaps, in some ways, better."" He turned to face me. ""Tell me about your life before. What did you leave behind?""

I thought about my apartment. My job. The routine that had felt safe but empty.

""Not much,"" I admitted. ""I worked at my uncle's shop. Good work, but nothing special. I had an apartment that was too expensive and too small. A friend I saw once a week. No girlfriend, no real hobbies beyond the gym. I was just… existing. Going through the motions.""

""And now?""

""Now I have purpose. Structure. People—well, vampires—who actually seem to care if I'm okay."" I shook my head. ""That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?""

""Its not pathetic"" Dracula said gently. ""We all want to matter. To be seen. To have purpose. There's no shame in finding that, regardless of the circumstances.""

He returned to his desk, pulled out a crystal decanter of something amber, poured two glasses. Handed me one.

""Whiskey,"" he said. ""1926. I acquired several cases before Prohibition made it impossible.""

I sipped. It was smooth, complex with a warm burn on the way down.

""Can I ask you something?"" I said.

""Of course.""

""Why did you really save me? Nadya said you needed a caretaker, but you could've found someone else. Could've made them forget and let me die. Why me?""

Dracula was quiet for a long moment, swirling his whiskey.

""Do you believe in fate, Dean?""

""I believe in probability and bad luck.""

He smiled. ""A pragmatist. Good. Fate is a pretty word for the intersection of circumstance and choice. You chose to help a stranger on the road. You chose to fight back when attacked. You chose to drive to my house instead of giving up and dying. Those choices brought you here.""

""That's not an answer.""

""No,"" he agreed. ""The truth is simpler. You reminded me of someone. The determination in your eyes, even while dying. The sarcasm as a shield. Thomas had that, when he was young. That refusal to be a victim, even when the universe was victimizing you quite thoroughly.""

""Thomas ended up staying for years.""

""He did. And he was happy. He became family."" Dracula's expression softened in a way I hadn't seen before. ""My daughters need that. They need someone who sees them as people, not monsters. Who treats them normally. Thomas provided that. I hope you will too.""

""They're starting to grow on me,"" I admitted. ""They're weird. Vivienne is deeply unsettling. Carmilla is terrifying. Isla has no impulse control. Seraphina is deeply clinical and Nadya she’s been nothing but kind to me” 

Dracula laughed—a real laugh, warm and surprised. ""That's the most accurate assessment of my daughters I've heard in decades.""

""Can I ask about them? How they became…"" I gestured vaguely.

""Vampires?"" He settled back in his chair. ""Each has her own story. Carmilla first—she was Wallachian nobility, turned in 1625. Her family tried to arrange a marriage to a brutal man. She refused. He killed her family in retaliation. I found her dying in her burning home and offered her a choice: death or immortality with the power to ensure nothing like that ever happened again.""

""And she chose that power.""

""She chose survival. And revenge. She tracked him down six months later. I won't tell you what she did to him, but it was… thorough."" He sipped his whiskey. ""Seraphina came next. 1675. She was a scholar in Prague, brilliant, but women weren't allowed in universities then. She was poisoning herself with mercury trying to treat an illness the doctors refused to address. I offered her eternity to pursue knowledge.""

""And she said yes.""

""She said 'prove that you're not a hallucination, then yes.' Very Seraphina.""

I could absolutely see that.

""Isla was 1775,"" Dracula continued. ""Circus performer in France. She was spectacular—acrobatics, tightrope walking, fire breathing. But she was also dying of consumption. The circus abandoned her when she became too sick to perform. I found her in a ditch outside Paris, still trying to practice her routines between coughing fits. She was so angry at the unfairness of it all.""

""Let me guess. You offered her a way out.""

""I offered her forever to be spectacular. She's never stopped being spectacular.""

""Nadya?""

His expression gentled. ""1825. She was a dancer in St. Petersburg. Beautiful, talented, kind. She was caught in the crossfire of a political assassination—wrong place, wrong time. She was dying in the street while people stepped over her to flee. The cruelty of it, the casual disregard for her life…"" He trailed off. ""She didn't want to die. Not like that. Not alone.""

""So you saved her.""

""I gave her a choice. She chose to live.""

""And Vivienne?""

""1875. Artist in Vienna. She was brilliant but poor, selling her work to survive. She was attacked one night walking home from selling a painting. They took everything—her money, her work, nearly her life. I found her bleeding in an alley, still clutching her paintbrush."" He smiled sadly. ""She said 'if I'm going to die, I want to finish the painting first.' That kind of dedication deserved to continue.""

I sat with that for a moment. Five women, all dying, all given a choice. All choosing to live, consequences be damned.

""You save people,"" I said slowly. ""That's what you do. You find people who are dying unfairly and you give them a way out.""

""Not always. Sometimes I'm the monster the stories claim. Sometimes I kill. Sometimes I'm the thing in the dark that should be feared."" He met my eyes. ""But yes. Sometimes I save people. When they deserve it.""

""What makes someone deserve it?""

""Defiance,"" he said simply. ""The refusal to accept an unjust ending. You had it. Thomas had it. My daughters had it. That spark that says 'no, this isn't how my story ends.'""

I thought about bleeding out in my car, refusing to pull over and die. Thought about dragging myself to his door.

""I just didn't want to die on a dirt road in the middle of nowhere,"" I said.

""Exactly."" Dracula raised his glass. ""To defiance. And to new beginnings.""

I clinked my glass against his. ""To not dying stupidly.""

""I'll drink to that.""

We sat in comfortable silence for a while, the fire crackling, the whiskey smooth and warm.

""My daughters like you,"" Dracula said eventually. ""Nadya speaks highly of your kindness. Seraphina finds your curiosity refreshing. Isla thinks you're hilarious. Even Carmilla admits you're competent, which from her is practically a declaration of love.""

""What about Vivienne?""

""Vivienne is obsessed with you, but she's obsessed with everything until the next thing captures her attention. Don't read too much into it."" He paused. ""But she did say you have 'the eyes of someone who's seen the abyss and flipped it off,' which I believe was a compliment.""

That sounded like Vivienne.

""They're good people,"" I said. ""Vampires. Whatever. You raised them well.""

Something shifted in Dracula's expression—surprise, maybe, or something softer.

""Thank you,"" he said quietly. ""That means more than you know.""

I finished my whiskey, set the glass down. ""Is there anything else you need from me? Besides the household stuff and the feeding?""

""Just… be yourself. Be human. Remind them that humanity isn't something to be pitied or feared, but something worth preserving. Even in themselves."" He stood, offering his hand. ""Welcome to the family, Dean. Officially.""

I shook his hand. His grip was firm, cool, powerful. But not threatening.

""Thanks for saving my life,"" I said.

""Thanks for stumbling onto my doorstep,"" he replied. ""I have a feeling you're going to be very good for this family.""

 

That night, I lay in bed thinking about everything Dracula had told me.

Five women, all saved from death. All given a choice. All choosing to live as monsters rather than die as victims.

I couldn't judge them for that. I'd made the same choice.

And maybe that's what Dracula had seen in me that night. Not just someone dying, but someone refusing to die. Someone who'd keep fighting until there was no fight left.

The feeding schedule had become routine. The household repairs were satisfying. The workouts with the sisters were becoming a highlight of my day.

This was my life now.

And for the first time in longer than I could remember, I was okay with that.

More than okay.

I was actually kind of happy.

My phone buzzed—the new one Dracula had given me, already set up with contacts I'd need, accounts I'd use. A text from Isla: Same time tomorrow but bring water bottles. Carmilla says we're doing ""cardio"" and she said it like it was a threat.

I smiled and typed back: She terrifies me. I'll bring extra water.

Smart. See you tomorrow, blood bag.

That's a terrible nickname.

You're right. How about Juice Box?

I'm blocking you.

No you're not. You love me.

I set the phone down, still smiling.

Yeah. I was going to be okay here.

Maybe better than okay.

**THE HUMAN SERVIETTE**

Selena sat in the makeshift green room (which was really just a pokey little back room of a secondhand record store) anxiously tapping her foot. She’d arrived in Toronto just this morning and would have four performances to give over the next five days before she was due at… wherever the hell it was her managers were sending her next. She couldn’t keep track of these things. She had people for that. Besides, she was well and truly *over* this tour.

This green room was like any of the others she had encountered while giving interviews on this tour. Except that in this one they had provided the wrong brand of mineral water. *Of course*. Apparently even being the next big thing in the world of pop was not enough to get decent help. Not here in the frozen north, at least. She sighed as she thought of her home back in Texas – the rugged plains and scorching heat – before her attention finally snapped back to the manilla folder that sat on the coffee table in front of her. Several impossibly large rubber bands were holding the folder together, as it was full with a ridiculous volume of sheets of paper. *Why not just use a bigger folder? Or multiple folders?* Selena thought, shaking her head.

She picked up the folder with a grunt and let it fall into her lap. Her agent had this sent over earlier today. It was a dossier full of information on the guy who would be conducting her upcoming interview, including transcripts of previous interviews he had done. Selena had flicked through it, vaguely, but not much more than that. Why should she? This guy knew *her*, and that was all that mattered. After all, everyone *loved* her.  

Her managers. Her agent. Who did they think she was? She was Selena-*fucking*\-Turner, that’s who! and she didn’t do homework for interviews. Certainly not for interviews with… she peered at the grainy printout hastily glued to the front of the dossier… some old hoser in a golf hat and sweater. Frankly, the guy looked like kind of a dweeb… and Selena couldn’t decide if it was in a cool, ironic way; a genuine, sincere way; or a cringey, try-hard way. Not that it mattered

She sighed and tried again to focus on the paperwork in front of her. Maybe some of it was important?

It wasn’t. Name, birthdate, family history. Why did she need to know any of that about some weird interviewer…sorry, ‘journalist’… she’d never heard of before? Selena’s flicking halted when she came upon a page that appeared to be a list of instructions. A kind of etiquette guide. All pretty obvious stuff, for the most part. One of the list items read:

**Do** ***not*** **look him directly in the eyes.**

Selena rolled her own eyes back in her head. Not another squeamish presenter who was too meek to be around the celebrities they were supposed to be interviewing. She had enough of that when she’d made a brief appearance on the local radio station of her home town. She supposed that next they’d ask her to pat him on the back and tell him he was a good boy.

**Do** ***not*** **accept his gifts.**

…Okay, that was a new one. Why would he be giving her gifts? What sort of gifts? Did they mean the fruit hamper hat had been left in the green room?  Selena turned an regarded the large wicker basket with its sad array of brown bananas and shriveled pears. She wrinkled her nose. No danger of her accepting *that*.

Most puzzling of all, however was the instruction;

***Definitely do not*** **sing his little song.**

Selena scoffed aloud at this. She *never* sang other people’s songs. She was the world’s greatest popstar. She only sang her own original compositions… plus a few tunes she had specially commissioned from others… and maybe a few that were in the public domain.

Selena tossed the hefty folder aside. It slid right off the table and landed on the moth-eaten carpet with a thud, spilling its contents everywhere. Whatever. Someone would be along to clean it up.

And, just like that, someone *did* arrive, a mousy-looking woman with a headset entered the greenroom and chirped, “We’re ready for you on set Ms. Turner!”

Selena flashed her perfect teeth.

  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Selena stood on the record store’s main floor and surveyed her surroundings. Not bad, actually. Later she would have to see if she had some time to go prowling among the aisles for any hidden gems. It was amazing what you could find in a place like this. Beside her stood her interviewer. They had not been formally introduced but Selena assumed this was down to the TV crew running late. In barely a moment the cameras were on and the interview commenced.

“Selena Turner!” The interviewer chirped as he flashed her a disarming smile, “Thank you so much for joining us today! I know you’re busy. You must be so tired of travelling and eager to get back to the… the rugged plains and scorching heat of your Texas home.”

Selena let you a self-deprecating giggle. “I’m excited to be here in Canada for the tour, but it *is* always nice to get home.” She looked up at her interviewer and noted how his dark eyes were almost comically enlarged by his glasses. The effect was so curious that, after a while, she had to shake her head to regain her focus. Then, she took a deep breath and prepared to launch into to her rehearsed speech about her tour and the concert here in Toronto.

Before she could get another word out, however, the interviewer announced “Actually, I have a present for you!”

This was unusual and, frankly, a little vexing. Selena’s practiced smile did not falter, but she did blink rapidly in confusion, “A gift? For me?”

Without turning, the interviewer reached to the shelf beside him and pulled out a record seemingly at random before passing it to Selena.  She accepted the gift with a gracious “Thank you,” before even seeing what she had in her hands.

Oh! An orange marble vinyl pressing of *Parachutes*. Well, wasn’t that a neat trick? “I was obsessed with Cold Play when I was in a kid!” she admitted.

“I know!” the interviewer declared. “And they obviously were such a huge influence on your work.”

Selena was not sure about this, but the interviewer continued, “Certainly they inspired my favourite of your songs… Hmm… What’s it called again? ‘Late Last Night’?”

Selena laughed, a little uncomfortably, “Umm… Haha… I think you must have confused me with someone else!”

The interviewer frowned, “No, no… it’s definitely you. It was sixth grade, remember?”

Selena stood in mute surprise.

While she stood there, unable to muster any words of her own, the interviewer softly started the sing the chorus of a song Selena hadn’t heard or thought of in well over a decade. Her mouth dropped and she started to tremble… and then she remembered, “Oh! My interview with Jimmy Kimmel! I told him I started writing songs when I was 12 and would sing them to my friends at school!” she laughed, with relief, “Oh my goodness, those songs were terrible!”

The interviewer sighed, “No, no. They were lovely!”

Something still bothered Selena though, even as the interview progressed and the interviewer bestowed gift upon thoughtful gift upon her (all impossibly *right*, all distressingly *intimate*) … She had described to Jimmy the songs she had made up at school, but she had not *performed them*. She had not even hummed them behind the scenes. In fact, she had never sung any of her childhood compositions, such as they were, to *anyone* since she was, herself, at school.

Was that it? Could this interviewer be an old classmate from back in the day? Selena tried to summon up an image of her childhood friends and other students at her school but, honestly, the faces all blurred together into a beige jumble of mediocrity.

The interviewer casually commented on something else incredibly specific and personal from her past and Selena said, “I think it’s interesting that you know that.” Trying to sound casual she added, “I want to know how you know that.”

The interviewer flashed a goofy grin, “You’re Selena Turner! We have to know that!”

Selena laughed, but persisted, “No, but really. How do you know that?”

He smiled, but said nothing. All the background sound seeped out of the world.

“… Who’s ‘We’?” Selena asked.

“I have another little gift for you…” Another vinyl appeared in Selena’s hands without her even noticing taking it. “Holy shit!” she breathed when she saw what was now in her hands – A 10” LP with a sleeve showing Eartha Kitt in a low-cut, strapless gown. *That Bad Eartha*. Selena slipped the vinyl part way out of its case and noted the deep groove of one of the first UK pressings. It featured Selena’s all-time favourite song, *I want to be Evil.* Her Nana had played that song to her over and over again while she was learning to sing.

“I know,” replied the interviewer.

Suddenly, Selena could see her right before her – Nana. Nana with her chestnut hair. Swirling around the kitchen in her ivory nightgown. The one with the blue ribbon at the hem.

“The trim was red,” came the far-off voice of the interviewer, “…And it was lace”. And he was right. Selena saw it now. The image of her Nana transforming before her eyes until it matched perfectly what the interviewer had said. What it always *had been*.

Selena swooned, collapsing into Nana’s thin…

“They were plump.”

…into her *plump* arms. Nana’s crimson lips parted and she released a faint and familiar ditty.

“Doot Doola Doot Doo...”

Selena smiled wanly up at her Nana… or the image of her Nana. Either way, there was only one response she could possibly give,

It's wild how even smart people mess up their time like it’s Monopoly money. Here's what most don’t realize: time isn't just about productivity. It's *identity*. Manage your time right, and you manage your energy, attention, and future.

After drowning in TikTok hustle bro garbage and productivity porn that’s just dopamine tricks, decided to actually dig into legit research and listen to people who’ve walked the walk, real investors, operators, deep thinkers like Cal Newport, Naval Ravikant, and experts from Harvard Business Review and McKinsey.

So if you’re stuck in chaos or just feel like your time leaks away every day, here’s a breakdown of 3 simple, deadly effective rules used by high performers who *actually* get stuff done.

* **Time is a slot machine, not a checklist**Most people treat time like it’s a to-do list, just throw more tasks onto it. That’s amateur mode. What the pros do: they build *routines that stack small wins*. Shane Parrish (Farnam Street) goes hard on this, he says ""consistency beats intensity."" That means, instead of saying “I’ll read 2 hours today,” say “Every morning, I’ll read 20 minutes while I drink coffee.” This creates what Charles Duhigg (author of *The Power of Habit*) calls a ""cue-routine-reward"" loop. It's not sexy, but it's how top people create outputs that look impossible.
* **Guard your deep time like it’s gold**Cal Newport (*Deep Work*) shows again and again: uninterrupted work is the key to value creation. But here’s the twist, McKinsey’s global productivity report found that employees spend only 9% of their week on “deep focus” tasks. The rest? Meetings, email, garbage busy work. Millionaires schedule deep focus like a meeting: block 2-3 hour chunks, no phone, no Slack, just *head down*. Even one block per day can change everything.
* **Say no like your life depends on it**This one hurts but it’s real. Naval Ravikant puts it in savage terms: “If you don’t guard your time, others will use it.” Harvard Business Review did a study showing the most successful leaders are ruthless with their time, not because they’re cold, but because every yes is a no to something else. Time is the *only* thing you can’t get back. If it’s not a “hell yes,” it’s a no. Period.

Every single one of these sounds “simple,” but that’s the trap. Complexity is a distraction. The elite win by doing boring things **consistently**, not by chasing hacks.

“Well, lookey-lookey! It’s Dennis the Menace!”

I couldn’t help but laugh at the corny nickname Lewis had saddled me with in junior year of high school.

“Really, dude? Almost twenty years, and you haven’t come up with anything better than that?” He gave a laugh of his own as he opened the door wide.

“Hey, when you have a classic, you don’t get rid of it! Come on in”

He stepped aside to let me enter, and I gladly hurried inside, the bitter air feeling like needles on the back of my neck. I unzipped my coat, the warm hallway shooing away any reminders that one of the coldest February’s in years was waiting like a panther just beyond the wood and plaster. Tossing it up on the stand he had set up next to the front door, I turned to him, shaking my bag gently to pose the unasked question. He jerked his head up the stairs that took up half the entry hall.

“Last door on the left side of the hall. I already put on a new set of sheets and blankets so you wouldn’t choke on the mothballs likely on the unused set”

I snorted, then began heading up the stairs. The third from the bottom let out its trademark squeak, indicating that even years later, and despite all the declarations from him, Lewis *still* hadn’t fixed it yet. I shook my head, gripping the banister as I ascended.

“Don’t be long, man” he called from behind me, “I’m in the middle of making my famous taco crescent ring and vegetables you like!”

At his words, I felt my stomach instinctively rumble. *If there’s one thing I can thank Lewis’ mother for, it’s making him one hell of a cook*. I raised a hand to acknowledge I heard him and kept climbing. A moment later, and I reached the second story landing. Lewis’ house was an old Victorian three story job that, like his car, had been inherited when one of his family had passed; in this case, one of his aunts.

To say that in his time of ownership, Lewis had made it into as much of an amalgamation that also seemed frozen in time was a grave understatement. When he’d moved in, he kept a lot of the mid-century furniture that had populated its interior since what I could only guess was the late fifties to mid-sixties. Things like the triplet grandfather clocks that stood on each landing and by the base of the stairs likely had never been moved. But he had also purchased and moved in some 90s and 2000s furniture he had snapped up at thrift stores; a leather couch, a wooden entertainment center and a set of matching La-Z-Boys were just some of the things he’d brought in to give his unique touches. And that was on top of the numerous CRT TV’s, VCR’s, DVD players and more he’d bought. The lack of any flat screen TV’s or anything approaching smart devices made the house feel as if time had frozen sometime in the mid 2000s.

*Just like him*.

I turned left and headed down the hall, my footfalls muted by the thick carpet laid down on the wooden floor. My eyes shifted to the walls, where poster and painting lined each side. Most were from over sixty years ago, though here and there a poster for a 90s or 2000s movie poster broke up the pattern. I reached the door, which stood next to the hall window, and reached for the doorknob. Despite the warmth in the house, the handle was slightly cool, and I quickly twisted it and pushed the door open. A rather nondescript bedroom greeted me, the full size bed and brass antique frame directly opposite the door. To the left, another door opened into what I could see was a small bathroom, and a small TV with a built in VCR sat on the dresser next to me. Unlike the hallway, the only thing that lined the wall was a long, rectangular frame in which a painting of a beach scene was set. I took a few steps into the room and tossed the bag on the bed.

“Okay, this is actually nice. I can dig this”

Quickly, I pulled my toothbrush and toothpaste out and set them in the bathroom, pausing to look at myself in the medicine cabinet’s mirror for a moment. Below me, I could faintly hear the sounds of Lewis moving about in the kitchen; pots and pans clanged as the faint smell of his cooking wafted upstairs. I inhaled, suddenly feeling starving. *The hell with it, I’ll finish unpacking after dinner*. Turning, I left the room, closing the door behind me. I began heading back towards the stairs. But I only made it about halfway when I stopped dead in my tracks. I couldn’t understand what had made me do so, but it was as if my body had rebelled against my mind, forcing it to halt. For a few moments, I simply waited, eyes looking around the hall and ears perked up. All I could hear was the sound of Lewis in the kitchen, and the slow, resonant *tick-tock* of the clock nearest me. *What the…*

The sound of the clocks, all three at once beginning to chime caused me to almost leave the floor and enter orbit. My head snapped towards the one on the landing as it slowly let out the Westminster chime, then gonged eight times. As the final chime faded away to be replaced again with the ticking, I fought to get my racing heart under control. *Jesus, Mary and Joseph, Dennis, get a grip. You’ve been in and out of this house for literal years. What are you getting so jumpy over?* For a moment, the words Lewis had said in the café floated up in my mind. I snorted, derisively at myself and headed for the stairs.

“Dinner time” I said softly. Below me, I heard Lewis let out a loud laugh before falling quiet once more. *Wonder if he dropped something*. I descended the stairs quickly, the third to last letting out another loud creak. From the back of the house, Lewis’ voice yelled.

“I’m almost done, Denny! Give me another five minutes; go and wander around or something!”

I laughed, then yelled back.

“Aight man, just don’t take forever. I’m starving!”

In response, from the kitchen doorway at the back of the main hall I saw his arm stick out, giving me a thumbs up. Satisfied, I first leaned into the long since used dining room on the left. The wooden table sat under a drop cloth protecting it, while glass door cabinets full of antique china, no doubt having belonged to his aunt sat awaiting a formal dinner that might never come. Turning, I began heading across to the other side. As I did, Lewis called out again.

“I’m gonna put some music on while I finish up, that cool with you, man?”

“Yeah, sounds good!”

Crossing over, I stepped through the doorway into the living room. It was instantly noticeable this was the room that Lewis had added the most amount of “modern” updates to since moving in five years ago. A huge Sony Trinitron TV, one that had no doubt taken five men to wrestle into place stood against the far wall, across from the leather couch and recliners that had been set up. A mirrored coffee table sat in front of the couch, while dotting every available area around the TV and wooden cabinets were the multitude of video games and movie players he stacked precariously on top of one another with reckless abandon. The walls were completely obscured with film posters that took up what little space remained from the family photos that hung there. In some ways, it was almost humorous, seeing Lewis’ stern faced grandparents in an old black and white photo, sharing wall space right next to a poster for *Female Jungle*. No doubt they would detest the fact that a, for the time, scantily clothed Jayne Mansfield shared the same square foot of wallpaper.

The sound of music slowly began to fill the house from behind me. The opening guitar chords hung in the air, echoing slowly and melodically. It felt like a slow, tense build up that seemed to charge the air with anticipation. I stood and listened as the drums kicked in, and the sound of the singer’s voice echoed down the hall.


I suddenly laughed at the recognition, feeling slight disbelief at the band I hadn’t heard since high school.

“Trapt? Really, Lew?” I muttered quietly. The song continued, what I now realized was *Victim*. I shook my head, unable to keep from smiling slightly. *You really never left the 2000s, have you man?* I turned my eyes back to the room, eyes shifting over the posters as I looked above the TV itself.

It took me a moment to realize what I was looking at. The moment I did, however, the smile vanished from my face as I recognized the one staring back at me in black and white.

The woman sat against an iron fence, he lithe frame clothed in a polka dot dress and off-the-shoulder top that gave more than a glimpse of her chest. The expression on her face was extremely hard to describe; from one angle, you could call it indifferent, but from another, it seemed to hold a mischievous, knowing look, one corner of her mouth clearly turned up ever so slightly in a subtle, sultry smile. The part that unnerved me the most was how the eyes, ones I’d been told countless times were brown, but in the colorless photo almost appeared black, almost seemed to follow you as you moved around the room. The fact that *Victim* was launching into its chorus, Chris Taylor-Brown almost begging to become someone’s newest victim was not helping the eerie feeling in the slightest.

*When in the hell did he move that in here?*

I couldn’t help but shudder as I looked up at Gabrielle Marchand. It wasn’t actually her that made me do so, it was the fact it reminded me of the insanity that Lewis had spewed earlier today. The woman was a symbol of exactly why I’d come here. I took a deep breath, centered myself, then stared at the huge picture again, feeling a heat begin rising at me. It was clearly misplaced; the woman had been dead long before either of us had been born, but I couldn’t help but feel anger towards the object of my friend’s fixation. I snorted, turning my back to the photo.

“Whatever” I muttered, beginning to head for the door.

As I reached the threshold, I looked back over my shoulder at the picture and paused. After a moment, I did the only thing I felt compelled to do. I raised my middle finger and flipped the bird to it. Letting out another snort, this one more victorious, I marched out defiantly into the hall –

\-And almost ran headlong into Lewis. We both started, him shooting out his arms to stop me from smashing into him.

“Whoa, man!”

I blinked a few times, then began laughing at the averted collision. After a moment, he joined in. Collecting myself, I gestured to the kitchen.

“Dinner all ready, then?” He nodded.

“You better believe it is, *and* I remembered to stop by the grocery store and grab a bottle of that taco sauce you and I always liked. The mild stuff that Mom always used to put on it”

I rubbed my hands together at the news.

“Dude, *hell* yes. I haven’t had this in years, and I’m seriously looking forward to it” He grinned at my response, and then his face seemed to fall ever so slightly. It was a face I’d occasionally seen him wear when he thought no one else was looking, and I knew full well what it meant. I leaned against the wall.

“You still miss her, don’t you, man?” His eyes flicked up to meet mine, then looked at the wall, sighing.

“It doesn’t matter if it’s one year or twenty. You don’t ever truly realize how much for granted you take your mother, until she’s gone. Especially for me after some of the shit I would occasionally say to her. If I could smack my younger self for being such a bastard, I would”

I reached out and put a hand on his shoulder.

“You were just a kid, Lew. Kids, and teenagers say shit they don’t ever mean because of the hormones and crap. She knew you didn’t mean it. And she knew you loved her”

My friend’s eyes climbed back up to meet mine, ones that reflected equal amounts of fragility and strength. After a moment, he nodded, then smiled a bit, reaching out and slapping me on the shoulder.

“Thanks, man” he said quietly, then gestured back towards the kitchen.

“Come on, let’s chow down. After we’re done, I’ve got a pleasant surprise for you, both for video games to play and movies to watch” I arched an eyebrow.

“Care to give a bit of a hint?” A conspiratorial smile spread across his face.

“Well, I won’t say outright, but let’s just say that I managed to get ahold of a certain first person shooter set in Vegas for my tiny 360 collection, and I found a VHS in the thrift store which stars a certain Donald Sutherland aboard a Russian ship infested with robot aliens”

I couldn’t help but let out an overjoyed laugh; *Rainbow Six: Vegas* and *Virus* were a combination we’d worn out as teenagers.

“Okay, I’m suddenly super stoked I chose to come chill! This is gonna be kick-ass!”

He laughed, then began to lead the way to the kitchen.

“Then come on and let’s eat! The night is young, and unlike when we were younger, we don’t have to get up early!”

 

The clocks all finished chiming, the gongs reverberating twice in a deep resonance as the two of us climbed the stairs to the upper floors, Lewis flipping off the hall lights as he brought up the rear. Reaching the second floor landing, I turned as he joined me. He jerked his thumb up towards the ceiling.

“If you need me for any reason, I’m in the master bedroom on the top floor. It’s the third door on the right”

I nodded, then raised my arms over my head as I yawned.

“Aight, man. I’m off to sleep, but I swear I am going to get you back for beating me tonight” He grinned.

“Fat chance of that, man” We both laughed, and I turned to head down the hall.

“Hey, Dennis?”

I turned back, seeing he had paused at the stairs to the third floor, one foot on the bottom step. He looked at me for a moment, his expression hidden by the shadows. Finally, he spoke, his voice quiet.

“Thanks. For this”

I felt a warmth flood through me at his words. *Maybe this is really what he needed, after all*. I nodded towards him.

“No problem, bro. Sleep well”

He raised a hand, then climbed the stairs out of sight. As he climbed, I heard him mutter something to himself too low for me to hear. After a moment, I heard a door open and close somewhere above me. Turning, I walked down the hallway, the streetlight outside illuminating enough to keep me from walking into any of the hall stands that guarded each end like sentries. Opening the door, I entered the bedroom, closing it behind me. Flipping on the light, I crossed to the bed and unzipped the gym bag, withdrawing my pajamas. Undressing, I quickly slipped on the pants, tossed the bag and clothes to the floor, then entered the bathroom and brushed my teeth. After finishing, I flipped off the bathroom light, crossed to the window to open the curtain just enough to let enough light in to guide my way if I got up in the middle of the night, then crossed to the switch.

As I reached out for it, I paused. Something was gnawing deep at the back of my mind, something I hadn’t realized while I’d been too busy having fun. But it was like a puzzle I didn’t have all the puzzle pieces to yet. I couldn’t make heads or tails of it. I shook my head; trying to figure it out tonight would do me no good. I’d try and figure it out tomorrow. Flipping off the light, I crossed back to the bed, threw back the covers and climbed in. The bed was extremely comfortable, and almost immediately I felt myself begin to drift off to sleep. I glanced at the small, round alarm clock ticking away on the stand next to the bed. 2:15AM.

“Well, good night” I said to nobody in particular, my eyes closing and blackness enveloping me.

 

When my eyes slid open to darkness, I felt a small spark of confusion. *Huh?* I was facing the wall, and rolled over to look out into the room. I saw the shape of the branches of the tree shifting across the floor and walls, almost looking like fingers reaching out in the shadows. Shaking my head slightly and still feeling a bit groggy, I reached out and picked up the alarm clock, bringing it close enough to read.

3:19. I’d only been asleep for just over an hour.

*What the hell woke me up?* I looked around the room. Aside from the soft *hiss* of the radiator on the far wall and the gentle whistle of the wind hitting the side of the house, all was still and silent. Running a hand over my face, I yawned, still feeling tired. *Must just be because I’m in someone else’s house.*  I laid my head back down on the pillow, closing my eyes and attempting for sleep to return to me. After a few minutes, the sensation of the Sandman dropping seeds into my eyes again returned, and I began to nod off. I hoped I’d stay asleep the rest of the night now.

*Creak*.

My eyes flew open as the soft sound reached my ears. I sat up in bed, looking around the room for the source of the noise. But I saw nothing that would have caused it. After a moment, the noise came again. This time, though, I was able to triangulate its rough direction. My head turned towards the closed door to the hallway. I had heard a creak on the busted step, yes, but I’d also heard it another place: on the bare wood sections of floor that were not covered by carpet. Which included just in front of each door.

*Creak*. The third repeat was the loudest, and for whatever reason, I couldn’t help but shiver at the sudden chill I felt flash through me. *What the hell, man?* Very slowly, I drew back the covers and swung my feet over the side of the bed until they touched the floor, trying as hard as I could be to be silent. Standing up, I tip toed towards the door, pausing just before reaching it. I held my breath, listening. No sound came from the other side. Slowly, gently, I stepped forward, turning my head sideways, getting as close to the door as I could without putting any pressure on it.

For another few moments, there was still silence. It drew out so long that I began to wonder if I simply had imagined the noise. I began to pull my head away from the door.

The muffled sound of footsteps padding away on the carpet suddenly sprang up, causing me to freeze. I listened to them recede, before the house again fell to silence. I felt equal parts bewildered and unnerved. As far as I knew, and I was sure of it, only Lewis and I were in the house. Reaching out, I took hold of the doorknob, which now felt shockingly cold to the touch. I hesitated for a moment, then slowly, quietly twisted it. I took a deep breath and pulled it open, sticking my head out into the hall.

The shadows made it almost impossible to make anything out more than about five feet away from the window, while the opposite end was completely shrouded in darkness. I squinted my eyes, trying to discern if I could see anything. But nothing moved.

*Creak.*

My eyes snapped towards where the banister that rounded down from the third floor and sloped out of sight to the ground floor. *That* creak was the one I knew had come from the loose step. I took a step out into the hall, eyes darting around, and looked up to the ceiling. No sound came from the floor above, which meant that Lewis hadn’t heard any of this. For a moment, the sudden thought that there might be a burglar in the house flashed through my mind, and I felt my breath hitch in my throat. *Great. I know Lewis has a gun, but he likely has it upstairs in his room. I should try and quietly get upstairs and wake him-*

“Wait a minute” I breathed out. Connections were being made in my mind. For a minute, I stood there, letting it work. A picture, the very one I’d been unable to piece together began to form. Ever since I’d gotten to the house, Lewis had never once mentioned the conversation in the café. It was as if it had never happened to him. The entire reason he’d wanted me to come was because he’d wanted to prove to me that he was telling me the truth. Which means, the only logical conclusion is-

“Mother…Fucker” I breathed out, feeling a flush rise in my cheeks. The burning sensation moved to cover my entire body as I felt irritation raise its ugly head. *The guy wants so badly for me to believe his bullshit, that he pretended to go to bed, and now he’s creeping around his own damn house in the dark to try and spook me. I don’t believe him*. I let out an exasperated, disbelieving chuckle.

“You gotta be kidding me, Lew. I love you to death man, but I’m about to freakin’ kick the shit out of you” I hissed into the dark. Suddenly, an idea came to me, one that turned the irritation to a sweet feel of revenge.

*All right, bro. You wanna play games? I can play them, too*.

Making sure I stayed on the carpet, I crept down the hallway until I stood near the top of the stairs. The ground floor was, if possible, even further shrouded in darkness than up here, but there was just enough light I could see the bottom and the two doors on either side of the front door. Nobody was in sight, and all I could hear was the ticking of the grandfather clocks.

For a moment.

After a second, another sound, almost hidden under the clocks came from downstairs. The soft, subtle sound of footsteps, trying to be discreet, moving away down the hall towards the back of the house. I smirked as I began to slowly descend the stairs. *Ready or not, buddy, here I come*. The footsteps stopped again as I got to the fourth step, and I looked down, trying to gauge how far I needed to step to climb over the third step to keep it from creaking. After a moment of judging, I reached out and gripped the banister, beginning to stretch my leg over it.

*CREAK*.

I snapped my head towards the banister I had just gripped. The wood flexed and groaned loudly as I put my weight on it, along with the realization it was louder than the step had ever been. *Shit!* I quickly pulled away from it and hopped as best as I could over the stair, hurrying down the final few steps to stand at the bottom.

The entire house had gone silent. My cover was blown.

“Shit” I hissed through gritted teeth. *Well, now he knows I’m up*. *Which means I don’t have to be as sneaky anymore*. Looking around the banister, I stared into the blackness of the hallway. Nothing moved. Then again, I didn’t expect anything to. Realizing I was awake and onto him, Lewis had likely gone off and found some place to hide. He knew if I caught him, the entire jig would be up.

*Well, too bad*.

I ducked my head into the dining room first, seeing no movement and no place anyone could hide. Taking three large steps, I crossed again and looked into the darkened living room. Nothing looked out of place here, either. I refused to allow myself to look at the picture on the wall; instead, wanting to vent some of my irritation, I flipped the bird to it again and, childishly, stuck my tongue out in its direction.

“You kiss off” I whispered.

Ducking back into the hallway, I slowly began to creep down it towards the back of the house, straining my ears to hear anything. But aside from the clocks, wind, and hiss of the radiators, nothing disturbed the stillness. I took another few steps. I decided I wanted this game to be over with so I could go back to sleep. After a second, I forced a word out of my lips in a whisper.

“Lew?”

I got no response. I tried again.

“Lewis?”

Still no response. I took another few steps down the hall.

The sound of music snapping on caused me to nearly jump out of my skin. I snapped up to my full height, whirling around. For a moment, confusion clouded my mind until I realized where it was coming from. The sound was slightly muffled, but the bass vibrated the entire bottom floor of the house. It was coming from the office he had set up in the back corner of the house, to take care of bills and attempt to write poetry. I began to walk quicker in its direction, hoping I’d catch my friend darting out of the room. As I drew closer, I recognized the unmistakable sound of Scott Stapp as Creed’s *What If* belted out of what I could see was a half-open door.

Reaching it, I reached out and yanked the door open. The room was dark, but the music was so loud in here that it felt as if the fillings would be vibrated right out of my teeth. It exacerbated my irritation, and I reached out, snapping the light on. The room was illuminated, and I saw his computer and piles of paperwork piled on his desk. I also saw his record player on the opposite wall, two giant speakers set up on either side of it. The record was spinning away on the turntable, and I quickly stalked over, reaching out and yanking the stylus up.

A loud scratch tore through the speakers, and then they settled into a loud *hiss*. I fumbled with the controls for a moment, then found the right button, turning the entire setup off. The speakers fell completely silent, and once again, so did the house.

All at once, behind me I heard the sound of the light switch being flipped, and I was plunged into blackness. Spinning around, my eyes could barely see anything. But there was enough ambient light that I caught a glimpse of a retreating figure moving down the hall. I dashed for the hall, gripping the doorframe as I came to a halt. For a moment, all was silent. Then the sound of what had to be bare feet came from the kitchen. I moved fast, my irritation finally bubbling over into anger as I rounded the doorway into it-

\-To nothing.

I stood, looking in disbelief and finally at the end of my rope. I was done being quiet.

“All right, asshole!” I growled out, turning around, “You’ve had your little fun at my expense, now you’re about to find out for the first time in your life what it’s like for your brother to kick your ass if you keep this up!”

A sound drifted to my ears from off to the left, in the small room behind the living room in response. It was a short bark of laughter, one that for a moment made me see red. *The fucker thinks this is that funny?!* It wasn’t for another moment that the realization hit me.

It wasn’t Lewis’ normal laugh. It sounded throatier and high pitched, almost feline in a way. I struggled to comprehend, until I realized the jackass was pretending to laugh like a woman.

“Okay, you asked for it, man!” I called, stomping to the door and throwing it open, I reached out and flicked the light on.

Finding another empty room.

My eyes flew to the open, dark door to the living room. Impulsively, I strode to it and stood there, staring into the dark. Nothing moved in the gloom spilling out from the light around me. I hissed through gritted teeth.

The light behind me flicked off.

I spun around, trying to catch a glimpse of him flying away from the door. But I saw nothing. Blue spots began to appear in my eyes from the transition from light to dark so rapidly. I was actively fighting myself not to lose my shit now. I decided to try one final time to get through to him with words. I held out my arms to either side of me, trying to calm my voice.

“Okay, you have something you wanna say to me? Go ahead and say it! Just say it and get it over with!”

For what felt like minutes, but in reality was likely only seconds, the house remained silent. But finally, it was broken as a voice cut through the silence, coming from behind me.

“Hello, Denny”

Instantly, every single ounce of irritation and anger I felt evaporated into nothing, replaced by a huge chill that felt like I had stepped outside. The laugh, I could easily have said that Lewis was imitating. The man was a master of imitating all of our laughs in a weird talent of his.

But that voice, was one he most certainly *couldn’t*. It was unmistakably feminine, somehow simultaneously breathy and sensual, and low-pitched and raspy. It had only said two words, but they had been enough that I’d been able to hear a thick accent in it, with the way the H in hello had been cut off, and my name had been drawn out. Whether it was a French accent or not, I couldn’t tell. Its tone had seemed to contain a duality, as if the speaker were both amused and unimpressed.

All the hair on my exposed arms and chest rose up as I fought to regain my breath. I felt rooted to the spot, unable to do anything but listen. After a moment, I heard the sound of footsteps approaching me from behind. Every rational part of my mind screamed at me that it had to be a prank. *He went and got some chick that can put on a good accent to sneak into the house and screw with you. Just turn around and get it over with!* I almost managed to, until I felt the sensation of breathing on the back of my neck.

Every rational thought I had flew away like a flock of birds as I felt it gently hit my exposed skin. The sensation was unlike anything I had ever experienced before in my life. I had felt someone breathe on my neck so many times I’d lost count; most of them had come from Kat coming up behind me. But this gave none of the warm, safe emotions she had. I tried to force myself to turn my head, but it was as if the primitive side of my brain had taken control. I simply stared straight ahead into the darkness. Behind me, I heard a small snort of laughter. The breath on my neck stopped, and I heard the footsteps recede towards the hall. After a moment, the house fell silent once again. But now it felt like the silence I had originally heard before I’d accidentally leaned on the railing. It was as if the house had returned to normal.

For a time, I continued to simply stand there, straining my ears to hear anything. When I felt truly safe, I slowly turned to look in the living room. It was as dark and empty as it had been when I’d first looked into it. My mind raced at a million miles an hour as I struggled to comprehend what had just happened. *There is…there is no fucking way in hell that just happened. No. No, you know damn well there are no ghosts or spirits or shit. But…what the hell was that, then?* I forced myself to speak aloud.

“Coincidences. That’s all. Just…coincidences. Lewis never actually turned off the record player, he just lifted the stylus. It fell on its own and started up like it obviously would. The lights, he had to put on a motion sensor. They had those in the 90s and 2000s, so it wouldn’t break his rule. That’s all, Dennis. And the voice….the voice is because you’re sleep deprived. You’re experiencing a waking nightmare or something. Lewis’ little story stuck with you, so your mind filled in the gaps. That’s all. Get your ass back up to bed. *Now*”

My voice shook more than a little, but the words felt as if they were allowing the sane world to reassert itself. I took a deep breath and let it out. I felt my body center itself a little more. To test it, I took two steps into the living room, then forced myself to look over my shoulder at the dark doorway. Nothing moved. I took another few steps, still training my eye on the door. It remained still. For a moment, my eyes flickered up to the picture above the TV. In the dark, I could barely see it, but the outline of the woman was enough for me to shudder. I took another step towards the hallway, my eyes looking back at where I’d come. *For God’s sake, it’s obvious nothing’s coming out of there. Grow up and go to bed!*

Sighing, I finally tore my gaze from the door and turned towards the hall-

\-Only to come face to face with a visage less than a foot from my own.

In the second I had to look at it, I took in the details. The dirty blonde hair that fell to the shoulders and beyond. The white shirt that barely clung to the figure, only held up by an ample bosom. The red dress, dotted with white circles. The bare feet that dug into the carpet. My eyes locked on the face, a face that was simultaneously beautiful and terrifying. The eyes stared at me with a feline intensity, and the lips contorted into what I can only describe as a predatory smile. For a microsecond, neither of us moved. I couldn’t have if I wanted to.

Then she was a blur of motion racing towards me. I caught a split second glimpse of her eyes again. They didn’t look brown like Lewis had always told me.

They looked absolutely black. Like the pit of Hell itself.

I couldn’t help myself. I opened my mouth and yelled as I rapidly began to backpedal. The room blurred as my mind screamed at me to just get away; to where was irrelevant. My legs hit something hard, and I felt the world begin to rotate as I fell backwards. Some small part of my brain prayed that I wasn’t about to go straight through the coffee table.

Instead, I felt myself slam into the leather of the couch, the wind knocked out of me and stars explode in my vision as my neck snapped back slightly. The pain in my neck shot through my body. But I was scrambling to sit up, to see where she was now.

The living room was empty. Completely devoid of life. So was the door to the hallway.

Somewhere far above me, I heard the sound of a door open, followed by footsteps rapidly making their way to the stairs. My mind began to race again as I tried to mentally explain away the last ten seconds of my life. But unlike the first time, there was no logical explanation I could come up with. Not with something *that* real. I began to feel dangerously close to hysteria.

So, as I heard Lewis call out my name from the floor above, I opened my mouth and yelled out the only four words I could think of.

“WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?!”

Moments later, the living room lights flicked on, and I found myself staring up at my friend. For a moment, he stared concerned at me. Then, as if he were able to read the expression on my face, it settled back into a calm expression.

You also cannot wear plant based fabrics like cotton or linen as it’ll make you burst into hives and cover your body in blotches.

In scenario two you can’t eat any animal products, meats, eggs, gelatine, most alcohol, chocolate, cheeses, anything made with fermentation because fungi are closer to animals than plants, no mushrooms and all that stuff.

Anything with animal byproducts that you touch also gives you hives and are painful to touch for more than 5 minutes.

If you eat anything you can’t you’ll be violently sick and go into a comatose state for a week with realistic and terrifying dreams you remember.

But there’s a third option, you can eat poultry and eggs, fish and vegetables and fruits, but you cannot eat anything from fermentation, no alcohol, no bread, no mushrooms, no cheese, non of that.

And you have hyper sensitive skin that easily cracks/rashes when too hot or cold, also you get a terrible nightmare every Friday that you remember.
