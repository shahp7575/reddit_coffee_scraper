Additionally, I have NO clue what the first step would even be to start working towards it. Here it goes:

I live in the US on the Mass/NH line. It‚Äôs relatively rural but very accessible, about an hour to Boston. My town has 10k people with a median household income of $106k/year, which seems to be the normal for the communities around me as well. 

I would like to open a plant shop/cafe that also sells locally crafted items.

I‚Äôm imagining a shop similar to a garden center but less commercial and more boutique, if that makes sense.

There‚Äôs nothing like that in my area. The closest thing would be House by the Side of the Road in Wilton NH, about 30 miles north of me. It‚Äôs my favorite place to shop for both houseplants and vegetable starts for my garden, but they offer a very wide array of other plants, too. In addition to plants they have a section of decor and trinkets, and they offer shoppers free popcorn. 

The local garden store is a very small Agway that sells a lot of plants and garden items but also a lot of animal feed and such. However, they do workshops in the summer which I do think is a great idea. 

I would envision my shop to be a very small nursery, nothing large scale at all. I would purchase plants wholesale from a local wholesaler and grow them myself when I can. I would sell house plants year round, and vegetable starts/fruit trees in line with those seasons. The cafe would be small, offering a few selections of coffee and tea. I‚Äôm not sure it would even have food. A few pieced together chairs and tables to give it a cottage-y feel. I would approach local artisans to have space for their products.

I‚Äôm well versed in gardening, and planning to take the master gardener‚Äôs course next year. Of course, I have a lot to learn but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve really enjoyed learning for about 10 years.

Anyways, I just don‚Äôt know what to do with all of this. I THINK my next step is establishing an LLC, getting a tax ID and start selling plants I purchase wholesale from my house/on Facebook marketplace. This will probably either confirm my idea, or make me realize I‚Äôm all set with it. I‚Äôd also like to get more involved in my community‚Äôs farmers markets and craft fairs, which would be great networking.

If I see my therapist on Monday and get a phone call on Tuesday that I've been reassigned to a new therapist, it really hurts me, and not just because I have to ""start over"" telling them my story. I had a lot of childhood trauma, and I still have issues with attachment. So being repeatedly ""abandoned"" by therapists without being able to say goodbye has really hurt me. I had therapy today and told the person this and it looks like I'm not a good candidate for therapy, generally. I'm wondering if there's any modality though where it's okay to not want your therapist to drop you?

Going to start an entry-level bank teller job next week making $40k/year.,"I'm having severe buyer's remorse and think my T10 MBA was a waste. I worked in T3 consulting pre-MBA, got into a T15 MBA in the full time program. I interned in a strategy & ops role at a famous tech company over the summer of 2022. But my return offer got rescinded in the Fall of 2022 during all of the layoffs.

I tried recruiting for other roles after the rescinding, but kept on getting rejected. Same with after I graduated. I'd get interviews, and even make it to the final round. But I never got the final offer. I asked for feedback and people would always say ""we liked you, and you have potential, but we found someone with years of the exact same relevant experience as this role.""

My initial target role was strategy, then once there were no roles there, I tried marketing. That didn't work. So then I pivoted to F500 corporate finance where I got a lot more traction and final round interviews but no offer. I tried different sectors like healthcare, pharma, government, government contracting, defense, retail, CPG, etc., and no bite.

I constantly use my MBA's career center, did a lot of networking and coffee chats with classmates and alum, asked for referrals which people gave me. But it didn't help. The career center can't magically give you a job. All they do is review your resume and do mock interviews. The ""connections"" they have seem overrated. I paid for a career coach, but similarly, they can just only provide feedback that you can get by easily googling as opposed to landing you a job.

The market is way too flooded right now with extreme competition for white collar roles. It's hard to compete against people with direct relevant experience to the open roles.

It's been nearly a year and a half since graduation from the MBA, and I need some income as well as health insurance. I tried temp placement agencies like Robert Half but they ghosted me. I even applied to my old company's consulting role at the same level and got rejected - same thing with other consultancies. They're not hiring.

So I decided to pick up an entry level bank teller role in my local city. At least it gives me benefits and a steady income. And pay back the $200k in MBA loans I took out. 

So yeah, I just feel for me the MBA even at a full time T15 program was a total waste. I'm now making way less than I did before the MBA. I'll still look for better places but I've semi given hope to be honest.",5,1731032858.0,MBA,6,0.78,False

I don't want to accept that fasting isn't for me.

Mostly problems getting to sleep, less so with staying asleep, clearly linked to anxiety and poor sleep hygiene. Bad sleep -> too much coffee is a death spiral. Started with Melatonin in high school, then to xanax (rx'd for anxiety), ambien (ugh), lunesta, gabapentin, and finally trazodone for the last 5ish years (100 mg -> 200mg -> 50 mg).

Trazodone gave me horrible morning grogginess, migraines, ringing in my ears, weird low blood pressure spells, and a whole bunch of other nasty side effects, but it was the least bad of everything before it. But it never fully worked: I had like a 20 minute window to get to sleep. Too early and my mind would start spinning; too late and I'd miss the effective window. If I double dosed I'd need to sleep until 10am the next day.

It really let me down in the last year or so: lots of anxiety linked to things outside of my control, and my sleeping was worse than it had ever been. So I quit. I tapered down to 25 mg and then stopped.

The first week was rough. I chose to do it during a slow period at work. I was sleeping like 3-4 hours max. We don't have AC and I just could not get comfortable, tossing and turning, weird dreams, irritable. Weeks 2 and 3 were better, then slow and steady improvement since then. I felt like my skin was hurting.

Well, 6 months out, and I've literally never been sleeping better in my life. I have more energy during the day and somehow, I'm more tired at night. The tinnitus and migraines have slowed. I'm drinking less coffee, exercising more, and am just generally happier (ironic since it's supposed to be an antidepressant). 

I recognize that I might have not been as successful if I had done this earlier, but I wish I had dropped it years ago. It might have saved me a lot of trouble last year.

I have blue hair, and someone said we 'looked good' together she DEMANDED we take a selfie together because we looked so good. This is not the first time she has demanded we have a photoshoot together 

I had ONE cup ready to get a coffee for myself. She saw me, walked over and stole my cup out of my hand and made herself a coffee saying 'You're trying to keep me longer at work, aren't you!' whilst smiling and grinning at me

She will bring me coffee in the morning and says we're 'Besties' she uses this term for people who are dating mostly but sometimes just to refer to as friends. 

We had a minor falling out over something dumb and she insisted we weren't besties or 'more than friends' anymore. However she slipped up and said i was her bestie today.

We finally did it over a coffee date yesterday, and what I was hoping would give us a ray of hope, actually did more to shatter my existing hopes. He selected very few, had a judgmental attitude towards me when he saw some of the stuff I selected, and told me later that he felt uncomfortable discussing sex, and would prefer not to discuss his kinks/fetishes. He went on to say  he believes love in a marriage shouldn't be affected by whether or not sex is present, and that he doesn't want to be ""controlled"" by bodily desires. He is very religious and spiritual, and I am absolutely connecting the two here. He said he doesn't think of sex as a bad thing, and is willing to work on improving our sex life, but his entire motivation comes from 'this is my duty towards my wife'.

1gm7olk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gm7olk,Kingslayer has Fallen - Welcome my new life ,"When my team and I arrived in the mountain village of Nuevo Mundo in southern Bolivia, we were in for a real culture shock. The village was so secluded that it attained a legendary status among the people of the Inca Trail, or Camino Inca. Supposedly, the entire village was built in the mountains by people left homeless or displaced by the drug war against Santa Blanca. The fact that the village was a thing wasn‚Äôt news to me.

What was news to me was how the village came about: according to legend, the village had been built entirely out of the wrecks of planes that had crashed in the Andes. Supposedly, if one were to overlook the mountains at night, one might potentially see the light beams of those there trying to blind the pilots, so as to crash their planes. 

I found it hard to believe at first, but it wasn‚Äôt until after he set foot in the village that I realized the stories I had heard were true.

Entire homes had been built out of crashed planes and airplane parts, complete with running water and heat. 

I had first been told about Nuevo Mundo by Miguel Cuya, a lieutenant in the Bolivian resistance movement known as the Kataris 26. After the DedSec team exposed a massive conspiracy that was connected to a plot to frame me for murder, the decision was made for my team and I to leave the hot-spots of Bolivia that were heavily occupied by the nefarious Santa Blanca Cartel, and flee to the mountains of southern Bolivia, where the chances of encountering Santa Blanca got slimmer and slimmer the farther down you went.

I had mixed feelings about living in a village made almost entirely from airplane wreckage, but over time he grew used to it. 

I checked the calendar app on my cellphone. Three weeks. It had been three weeks since we‚Äôd moved to Nuevo Mundo. 

And we still were not used to the cold weather. Sure, I had an insulated sleeveless jacket with a built-in heater but even I knew it wasn‚Äôt enough to prevent frostbite. Oh well. At least I had coffee to keep me warm.

Inca Camina was a mountainous province, and one with the highest elevation, which helped to explain both the low population of people, the almost total lack of UNIDAD outposts and the mediocre occupation force fielded by the Santa Blanca cartel. Located on the west mountain chain, the province peaked at about five thousand meters. The province had only one industry: llama farms.

Nuevo Mundo wasn‚Äôt the only village in the province either; Julpe Alto and Inca Chaca were home to more animals than people, with Nuevo Mundo being only the most recent village to be established in the province.

The province also was notable for its many mountain passes leading to Peru, along with the remnants of ancient Incan roads, with one of them leading to Incan ruins. The province had railroads that led directly to Peru.

I could have taken any of the trains directly to Peru and left Santa Blanca behind.

The only reason why I didn‚Äôt was because he didn‚Äôt want anything in connection to the conspiracy involving Miguel De Los Monteros‚Äô murder following him there.

Exactly one month ago, I was part of an operation spearheaded by the hacktivist organization DedSec to investigate the corruption of Miguel De Los Monteros, a corrupt Bolivian police officer. Somehow the operation went wrong and DedSec wound up being framed for the murder.

Thanks to the Kataris 26, my team and I were able to uncover and expose a massive conspiracy that was linked to Officer De Los Monteros‚Äô assassination. It took a massive, incredibly violent crusade across multiple provinces in Bolivia to prove I wasn‚Äôt involved with the assassination of Officer De Los Monteros, and it ended with my buddy Aiden Pearce and I shooting the guy who led the entire operation in cold blood.

While whacking the guy in charge meant the end of the operation in Bolivia, we knew that it wasn‚Äôt by any means the end of the war. It was only a matter of time before whoever sent those people would catch on to the fact that their field commander was dead, and that we were the ones behind it.

Thus explaining why we were in Nuevo Mundo. The farther away we were from Santa Blanca-occupied zones, the better.

Plus we didn‚Äôt even know if there were other teams of those mercs prowling around. Sure, the mercs we faced were decimated but we knew better than to think they were the only team that was sent to Bolivia. There could be at least three or four different teams in Bolivia just waiting for the perfect opportunity to ambush us if we weren‚Äôt careful.

It wasn‚Äôt all bad: we got regular updates from the Kataris 26 and what they were up to. We even got to accompany them on supply raids whenever possible. 

One time I even got to pilot a stolen helicopter. I‚Äôm no skilled chopper pilot but at least I have a license and can avoid crashing into things. Just don‚Äôt tell Marcus Holloway. He‚Äôs a horrible helicopter pilot. Don‚Äôt believe me? One time he helped steal a Santa Blanca helicopter, only to crash it into the side of a mountain within a matter of minutes.

BREAKING NEWS: Helicopter reported stolen from Media Luna!

At about 5:45 PM local time, UNIDAD forces were called to MOB Condor in Media Luna after a helicopter was reported stolen. The helicopter, which contained cargo of an unknown nature, was due to be shipped to Montuyoc Province from Media Luna the next day. No comment was received from either UNIDAD commander Pablo Baro Rebolledo or Santa Blanca‚Äôs leader El Sue√±o. 

A preliminary investigation has revealed that the theft is not connected to the assassination of Unidad officer Migue De Los Monteros that occurred nine months earlier.

Author‚Äôs note: Apologies if the images are misleading (they show Jock Bentley and company in Caimanes when the text indicates they relocated to Inca Camina). They are supposed to be from a period of time prior to Jock Bentley and company relocating to Inca Camina. 

Hope this helps clear things up!

Until next time, Ghosts‚Ä¶

Backstory: After TTC for a little over a year, my husband and I (both 34) went to an RE. My cycle is consistently between 28-30 days, I have been tracking and confirming ovulation (days 16-18) since we started trying, and have always had a very regular period. 

After bloodwork and an ultrasound, the RE informed us I had less eggs than is ideal for my age and he would like to start Clomid. My husbands tests came back normal and my HSG showed my tubes are open. We decided to start with a round of Clomid/TI before proceeding with IUI. We were unfortunately not successful, and I was looking forward to trying again this next cycle. However, my period came in the form of brown spotting with what looked like coffee grounds and barely lasted 2 days. I also had zero cramps, headaches, or other PMS symptoms. I mentioned this to the RE and was told it was normal. I went for bloodwork in order to begin the next round of Clomid, and was told my estradiol was too elevated 2 days in a row. 

This month is now basically a wash. My ovulation tracker showed an LH rise and ""peak fertility"" today (days earlier than I would expect). I'm still waiting to confirm ovulation, but I've had no noticeable CM, which has never been an issue. I'm just feeling so frustrated at this point because while we were struggling to get pregnant before, I took comfort in the fact that my body was cooperating in other ways. Now it feels like I ruined what actually was working and I'm scared my cycle will never go back to normal. The RE office is acting as though this is the most common thing, but I can't find many similar stories when searching online. Anyone else experience similar?

We had a good crowd So that made it slightly less annoying than normally when I have to take care of all of the crappy people because he goes and avoids them. 

One of the residents brought me wings for dollar ring night so that was my dinner. I love all of the cool ones that think of us like that. Of course I bought them a few beers (on the house)  back to help balance it out so it doesn't cost me anything. Right now I'm going to get my coffee for the night and go home and smoke a little and pass the fuck out. I am just so exhausted. I got up this morning to make sure our made it to the bus and I ended up going back to sleep until 10:30 in the morning. I never do that. Or at least I have it in a while. It just seems like no matter how much I rest and sleep I just can't catch up. I'm not eating. Very good and all of that because I'm just stressed out and everything is out of whack. 

I miss you bunches. I'm sorry to hear that you were so sick and I hope that you are feeling better and that work isn't killing you too much. I miss talking to you and I hope I get to hear you soon. I will write again tomorrow.

1gm7hru,https://www.reddit.com/r/throneandliberty/comments/1gm7hru/small_scale_battles_dominion_events_and_arena_is/,Small Scale Battles (Dominion Events and Arena) is it even worth taking into account current state of PVP as a Non GS user.,"I'm a XBow/Dagger user, and every time I go against a GS user, I get CC so hard, that I might as well go grab a coffee instead of spectating the GS user finishing his combo as I can't do anything to stop. I get it, it is Rock Paper Scissors, and I'm building Ranged/Magic Evasion, but I can't do anything once I get stunned. It's a one sided battle and unfun.  
If I go arena and thee opposite team have a SnS/GS and my team does not, the match is pretty much already defined. It's not even worth to try and win. I'm not using the Smoke Screen Specialization for Melee Evasion, but even that skill had the specialization, it has like 1 min cooldown maxed out, where GS users can CC much more often.  
SnS/GS are tanky, and have a massive damage output, which also does not help.  
Is it that hard to reduce CC duration, and increase stun resistance to immense values after being stunned, preventing being stunned over and over?   
Because with the current state of pvp I don't even want to play small scale pvp, and besides that it's either Large Scale against Zergs or Riftstones and Boonstones if they are contested/matched and if both guilds are on same standing, both in gear and players online.  
The stun is not an issue only for GS users, Vortex Tornado is also another issue, where like 5 players rotate between casting Vortex Tornado, constantly CC tons of people at the same time, and flash wave healing and dealing dmg, which should be different specs, with only 1 active.

  
They are going to implement more PvP events, instead of fixing PvP, making new PvP events with the current meta, will only show that PvP is not fun.  
If you get tired of PVE content and want to try something different, the only thing you can go is PVP, and well if you aren't a GS user, depending on matchup the experience will not be good, and if you go against a guild full of staff users casting Vortex Tornado, it's also not fun.

I never properly played Large Scale PVP, as for now my GvG we were majorly outnumbered and sometimes outgeared, so on that topic I might be accurate, but as a bomber although i'm can output a lot of dmg, i'm death after, and need to infiltrate the backline. Whereas other classes are easier to play and can outperform harder ones (No offense), but on my alt i'm staff/bow and PVE is easier, just cast any spell of CD and be a statue on backline less likely to take damage.",0,1731031076.0,throneandliberty,3,0.5,False

Or, more specifically, the DJ formerly known as Erich Zann.¬† He‚Äôs changed his name; his Spotify and YouTube all his socials have been nuked.¬† He‚Äôs definitely left New York.¬† But he‚Äôs out there somewhere.¬† Making more of his strange, disynchronous, yet hypnotic music.¬† Building a new fanbase.¬† Luring them in, before‚Ä¶ well, a repeat of what happened at The P\*\*\*\*\* in Bushwick. ¬†

Twenty-nine people dead.¬† An electrical fire, the investigators claimed.¬† Faulty wiring.¬† You know how it is with these poorly-maintained, converted warehouses.¬† A fire, the local news repeated.¬† ‚ÄúFire‚Äù was the story they were sticking to.¬† If anyone from the FBI or the CIA or any shadowy X Files agency knows any better, they aren‚Äôt saying anything at all. ¬†

\*\*\*\*\*

A bartender buddy of mine, Andy, recommended me for the DJ Erich Zann gig. ¬†

*Dude you up to work a concert in Bushwick?*¬† He‚Äôd texted me.¬† *A guy called last night, said he found my business card.¬† But I‚Äôm already booked on the Lower East Side.¬† Pays $100 for the night, plus tips.¬† Really small gig, shouldn‚Äôt be much work.*

I said I‚Äôd do it.¬† I recognized the address.¬† The P\*\*\*\*\* was an old warehouse at the ass-end of Bushwick, wedged into a corner between the Queens County border and the cemetery, surrounded by other abandoned warehouses - tagged up, with metal-roofed awnings and those huge roll-up doors you see on industrial properties.¬† The owners had re-wired and re-designed the inside, to be rented out for art shows, concerts, and club nights. ¬†

Andy sent me a photo of the event‚Äôs promotional flier.¬† It was shiny black, with a childlike drawing of a stick-figure girl leading a huge, fluffy monster on a leash.¬† The design appeared cute at first glance, but the longer you looked at it, the more disturbing it became.¬† The monster's crudely-drawn human face was too large for its body.¬† Its toothy mouth seemed less a friendly smile than a threatening sneer.¬† *DJ Erich Zann.¬† 10pm.*¬†

I spent some time internet-stalking DJ Erich Zann.¬† The guy played up the mystique, for sure.¬† I found only one photo of the DJ himself, and it wasn‚Äôt a particularly revealing one.¬† Just a man, in a Cthulhu mask and turtleneck, standing behind a sound board, with long sleeves and gloves on his hands. ¬†

I clicked into his YouTube.

*DJ Erich Zann*, the profile read.¬† *We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity.* ¬†

H.P. Lovecraft.¬† He‚Äôd also stolen his stage name from an H.P. Lovecraft story.¬† Adorable.

I hit play on a video titled Asenath #14.¬† 25K views; 1,500 likes; comments disabled. 

The music started slow and low, pounding bass over a hazy, barely-perceptible electronic rumble.¬† On the video screen, against an empty background, bits of white light swirled and exploded and pulled back together, then split into pulsating stars in primary colors.¬† A trilling instrumental melody stretched over the repetitive bass-line, rising and falling and shooting off into a million different directions, as the colorful stars on screen spun like pinwheels, light blending and shifting and modulating, before a frenetic piping overcame the instrumental tapestry‚Ä¶

‚ÄúWow!¬† FIFTY percent off!¬† Bill‚Äôs Better Secondhand Furniture post-Labor Day sale!‚Äù

I muted my laptop as an ad replaced the hypnotic EDM melody.¬† Asenath #14 had been really short. ¬†

Except, it wasn‚Äôt.¬† Asenath #14 was 33 minutes, 45 seconds long. ¬†

I frowned.¬† No way I‚Äôd listened to that song for over a half an hour. ¬†

\*\*\*\*\*

I called the number Andy gave me; no one picked up.¬† So, around eight thirty, I walked from the train station to The P\*\*\*\*\*, down an alley to the back parking lot and employee entrance.¬† There was clearly something going on - I could hear the *thud, thud, thud* of electronic bass.¬† But, unlike every other time I‚Äôd worked the venue, there were no roadies trudging in and out with heavy equipment.¬† There were no people around at all. ¬†

No cars in the back parking lot either, except for one camper van.¬† That, in and of itself, wouldn‚Äôt be surprising - plenty of touring musicians live out of vans.¬† But this one was odd because it was completely blacked out.¬† I‚Äôm not talking about tinted windows.¬† Someone had taken the effort to cover every spot where light might seep through with opaque, dull black material. ¬†

*Asshole‚Äôs committed to the aesthetic*, I thought.

Even stranger, the rolling door of the loading dock was still closed and locked.¬† As was the employee door. There was a handwritten sign posted there: ABSOLUTELY NO ENTRY UNTIL 10PM.

My next thought was the one that, in a roundabout way, saved my life.

It went: *screw that upside down, backwards and sideways.* ¬†

The promo fliers said the event started at 10:00.¬† Which meant, the moron who‚Äôd posted the sign assumed I‚Äôd be able to set up a full bar while dealing with a line full of guests wanting to get liqueured up before the show.¬† Lucky for me, I‚Äôd poured wine at a gallery popup at The P\*\*\*\*\* two weekends before.¬† And I‚Äôd forgotten to return the key.

The way The P\*\*\*\*\* is set up, the bar is in a separate, smaller backroom, connected to the showroom by a squat hallway.¬† The employee door opened into the backroom, where I found my crates of liquor already deposited on top of the bar.¬† The throbbing bass line I‚Äôd heard outside emanated from the showroom, rhythmic and looping.¬† I saw moving shadows.¬† I assumed the tech guys were all in there. ¬†

I got to work organizing bottles as the last of the summer evening light faded to darkness, bass booming in my head, guiding my movements like a conductor.¬† An hour later, I had to pee.¬† I didn‚Äôt want to annoy the roadies, or piss off whoever didn‚Äôt want me in The P\*\*\*\*\* before ten, but the venue‚Äôs only bathrooms were in the showroom, and the building was isolated amongst a sea of empty warehouses, and my only other option was to whip it out in the parking lot. ¬†

So I went.¬† At the end of the hallway, I froze.

There were figures setting up the stage, but they weren‚Äôt roadies.

They were pitch-black automatons shaped like naked, featureless, sexless humans; mannequins at the mall become animate.¬† Their skin looked the consistency of clay.¬† They moved fluidly, more organic than robotic.¬† There were six of them.¬† Each had arms and legs and, in lieu of a head, a cube-shaped protuberance emitting small peals of grey smoke as they lifted crates of lights and arranged amps on the main stage.

I yelped.¬† I backpedaled.¬† My foot caught on something; I stumbled, a weight gave way, and the music stopped.¬† I realized the looped bass-line had come from a laptop, plugged in on the floor.¬† I‚Äôd tripped over it.¬† I‚Äôd hit a button or two.¬† I‚Äôd killed the music. ¬†

SLAM!¬† CRASH!

Metal framing was dropped.¬† The sound board hit the elevated stage with a hollow THUD!¬† Everything the claylike, pitch-black, humanoid faux-roadies had been carrying fell to the ground.

As the faux-roadies themselves melted, like butter in a pan, into gelatinous black puddles.

\*\*\*\*\*

After The P\*\*\*\*\* incident - after that night - I scoured the internet for people who knew DJ Erich Zann.¬† People who could explain to me who he actually was.¬† Or who he‚Äôd been before he was DJ Erich Zann.

*He kinda just appeared on Spotify in 2021*, one Redditor wrote.

*I thought he was an AI*, said another. ¬†

*Didn‚Äôt he die in a fire at his concert in Brooklyn?*¬† Asked yet another.¬† *I dunno, maybe start there?¬† His family must‚Äôve said something.*

His family - if they existed - hadn‚Äôt uttered a word.¬† I‚Äôd scoured the internet for an actual photograph of DJ Erich Zann, or even a recording of his voice, and came up with nothing. ¬†

Finally, User Gregg87 direct messaged me.

*DJ Erich Zann was my roommate*, he wrote.¬† *I‚Äôll be in NYC next week for Tech Week.¬† I can tell you everything.* ¬†

\*\*\*\*\*

Gregg87 is a real guy, with a real name and a family and a life in Pasadena, California.¬† But for privacy purposes, I‚Äôll refer to him here as, simply, Greg.¬† Greg is an aerospace engineer with a Master‚Äôs degree.¬† We met at a quiet coffee shop in Williamsburg.¬† He‚Äôd known DJ Erich Zann while they were both college students in the late two thousands.¬†

‚ÄúJames Hadley,‚Äù Greg told me.¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs his real name.‚Äù

James Hadley and Greg shared a Pasadena apartment, a few blocks from the university they both attended, during Greg‚Äôs senior year of college.¬† James, though a year younger, was already three years into a Ph.D. program in theoretical physics.¬† Their residential situation had been arranged by university student services; for half a semester, Greg said, it felt more like living with a skittish cat than another young adult.

James spent every minute he wasn‚Äôt on campus barricaded in his room, working through equations or practicing his electric violin with headphones in.¬† Whenever he inadvertently found himself in the same room with Greg, he‚Äôd lower his eyes and scurry away like a cockroach in the light. ¬†

Greg felt sorry for him.¬† He made it his mission to befriend his reclusive roommate, approaching the task as one would set about domesticating a feral pet.¬† Greg stopped studying in his room; instead, he‚Äôd arrange himself on the couch in the common room, hook his laptop to the TV, and play old Star Trek episodes as background noise.¬† On the rare occasion James emerged from his room, Greg would invite him to sit and watch.¬† At first, James might linger for a few minutes.¬† Then, he started sitting down beside Greg.¬† Finally, after a month of warming up, he brought own work into the common room so they could study together.¬† When that became comfortable, James - at long last - began to speak.

‚ÄúIt was school stuff, at first,‚Äù Greg told me.¬† ‚ÄúHis area was string theory unification‚Ä¶ universe-building stuff, the interchange between particle physics and a potential tapestry of infinite planes‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not even sure I can explain it correctly.¬† Eventually, though, I got him to open up about his life outside his research.¬† You know, his family.‚Äù

James Hadley had been the beloved only child of successful parents.¬† When they‚Äôd realized their seven-year-old could solve advanced algebraic equations and play Mozart on the violin, they lobbied James‚Äôs small private academy to skip him from second grade to seventh. He excelled both academically and musically, but his relationship with other children was a source of anxiety.¬† The bigger boys in the neighborhood bullied him for being ‚Äúweird,‚Äù while his pre-teen classmates treated him as more spectacle than friend. ¬†

Finally, his parents pulled him out of school altogether.¬† His mother - a professor at Cal State LA‚Äôs School of Education - taught him at home until, aged thirteen, James was accepted into a prestigious university.¬† His mom and dad switched off driving him to and from college, even after he finished undergrad and began his Ph.D. coursework, until that year.¬† That year, his parents both died: his mother, in March, after a long battle with breast cancer; his father, in July, from a sudden heart attack.¬† Without them, James felt alone in the world.¬† They weren‚Äôt just family; they‚Äôd been his cheerleaders, his most enthusiastic supporters, his only friends.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to live in society,‚Äù James admitted to Greg.¬† ‚ÄúI want friends my own age.¬† I want to go to parties, to socialize, to find my people.¬† I just‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow about music?‚Äù¬† Greg asked him.¬† ‚ÄúMaybe try and find a band to play with.‚Äù

James took that advice to heart.¬† He bought himself a guitar and practiced in garages with stoners he met on Craigslist.¬† But it wasn‚Äôt a fit.¬† The guy wasn‚Äôt built to be a rocker - he was too self-conscious, too anal, a black hole of charisma.¬† Then, Greg had an epiphany.¬† Electronic music was still relatively niche then, still geeky.¬† James was intrigued.¬† A cousin of Greg‚Äôs bought ProTools to mess with as a hobby, then lost interest; Greg convinced him to sell his entire setup to James at a discount.¬†

‚ÄúAs a DJ, he could play a character,‚Äù Greg explained.¬† ‚ÄúHe could venture out into the world, be the life of the party, surround himself with people - without bursting his bubble.‚Äù

And it worked.¬† It worked better than Greg could‚Äôve ever imagined.

James, a musical prodigy with technical skills, took to ProTools like a duck to water.¬† The ability to produce sounds no human voice or human hands could produce, for him, was the purest form of creation.¬† His music blended sounds and rhythms together that shouldn‚Äôt have mixed, yet did, into hypnotic harmonies that transfixed listeners.¬† Greg connected him to high school buddies at other LA universities; soon, James had built a small following and a solid side hustle as a frat party entertainer.¬† He went through a few names: DJ Schrodinger, StarboyXJH, Majorana Fermion. ¬†

‚ÄúIt should‚Äôve stayed that way,‚Äù Greg said wistfully.¬† ‚ÄúI thought he was happy.¬† But James always wanted more.‚Äù

One night, Greg was out studying at a friend‚Äôs house when he got a text from James.¬† *Come home now*, the text read, with twenty exclamation points.¬† Greg did as he was told.¬† When he arrived, he found his usually-restrained roommate bouncing around like an excited puppy.

‚ÄúYou have to see this!‚Äù he exclaimed, dragging Greg into his room and shutting the door.¬† He turned out the lights, typed a few keys on his computer, and closed his eyes as music flowed forth. ¬†

‚ÄúThere was a recorder, piping over a string quartet, over a brass band, over a bass line that sounded like a train approaching‚Äù Greg said.¬† ‚ÄúI thought I heard screaming cats in there somewhere, too.¬† All the different melodies came together, then broke apart, then‚Ä¶ curved.¬† Can music curve?‚Äù

Mesmerized, Greg eventually realized he was no longer in James‚Äôs room. ¬†

They were outside - he felt the warm air against his face - on an alien planet with a rich maroon sky.¬† Obsidian-black tundra stretched forever into the distance on all sides, dotted with throbbing golden orbs emitting the feeling of rough sandpaper.¬† James stood there with him and, before them, a black swamp bubbled.¬† Tar-like globules crawled out.¬† Like snakes to a snake charmer, or flowers to the sun, they reached with wormy black tendrils towards the music, and began to sway in time with the rhythm. ¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how long it lasted,‚Äù Greg said.¬† ‚ÄúTime meant nothing.¬† Then, I was back in James‚Äôs room, balled up on the floor.‚Äù

As soon as the room stopped spinning and Greg regained his ability to speak, he demanded James tell him what he‚Äôd done to them.¬† James grinned from ear to ear.

‚ÄúThe promise of string theory,‚Äù he said.¬† ‚ÄúI manipulated matter with my music.¬† I changed our vibrations.¬† I took us to another dimension.‚Äù

‚ÄúShit, James,‚Äù Greg stammered.¬† ‚ÄúWhat if‚Ä¶ what if we couldn‚Äôt get back?¬† Or if we got hurt or something?‚Äù

James smiled wider.¬† ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to worry about that.¬† We‚Äôre ghosts there.¬† Nothing could touch us.‚Äù

Greg had to admit: the experience of transporting himself to another dimension, through music, had been cool.¬† Soon, James incorporated interdimensional tourism into his live sets.¬† He conjured up bubbly pink jungles with cute flying felines, or forests full of multicolored plants and bugs that resembled the drawings of sugar-high kindergarteners, or stark rocky seashores where blood-red waves met a blanket of thick, blue snow.¬† He gained himself a reputation, amongst Southern California sorority girls and underground EDM fans, as the DJ whose music could generate hallucinations without drugs. ¬†

James should‚Äôve been happy.¬† Yet still, he wasn‚Äôt satisfied.

On a rainy winter night, Greg returned home late.¬† He heard violin music emanating from James‚Äôs room.¬† The song was fast and frenetic, jumping around from high octaves to low, jarring and nerve-rattling.¬† Tired and annoyed, Greg went straight to James‚Äôs room and shoved open the door.

Lights flashed from his computer, which James was connected to via his headphones.¬† Acoustic violin at his chin, James‚Äôs hands danced like dying spiders, racing up and down the neck of the instrument.¬† His eyes stared straight ahead, bloodshot and unthinking.¬† On his face, an expression of unspeakable pain and horror.¬†

Greg ran to him and pulled off his headphones, accidentally dislodging them from their jack in the process.¬† Music - the music that had driven his roommate to his current state - filled the room.¬† And Greg felt himself tugged violently into James‚Äôs nightmare. ¬†

They were trapped in an endless cave, illuminated only by a greenish glow.¬† Metallic spikes, jagged stalagmites, covered the walls and ceiling and floor, jutting out as though to impale prey.¬† A milky-white substance, the consistency of glue, moistened the spikes like saliva. ¬†

A grey thing lurked behind James. ¬†

A faceless man, made of grey liquid steel.¬† Bubbling and dripping and re-congealing, it arms wrapped around his waist, leaving his arms free to fiddle like a madman.¬† It bent its hulking form, head over James‚Äôs head, lips locked to his temple as though it were drinking him. ¬†

Greg froze, so disturbed by the liquid steel monster he didn‚Äôt immediately notice the small creature sniffing at his feet.¬† It was a thing the size of a puppy and the shape of a hamster, resembling a sentient steel wool sponge.¬† It opened a mouth, much too large, and flashed dripping grey teeth like the surrounding stalagmites.¬† It stared up at Greg with gelatinous yellow eyes. ¬†

Then, the world spun.¬† Everything went black.

Greg woke sometime later, sprawled on the floor of James‚Äôs room, behind his desk, surrounded by silence.¬† A trickle of blood dripped down his forehead.¬† He pulled himself to his knees and fell against the wall, eyes clinched shut, grasping for a timeline.¬† James got stuck in another dimension.¬† Greg heard the music, he went there too.¬† They were supposed to be ghosts; nothing was supposed to touch them.¬† But something did, a creature of molten metal, and it attached itself to James.¬† Greg passed out.¬† As he fell, his body slammed against James‚Äôs computer, cutting the music and launching them back into their appropriate reality.

*James.*¬† Where was James?

Greg forced his eyes open.¬† James lay on the ground hear him, breath shallow, eyes wide and distant.¬† Greg crawled to him.¬† James‚Äôs lips moved. ¬†

‚ÄúA thousand,‚Äù he muttered.¬† ‚ÄúA thousand.¬† A thousand.‚Äù

Then he fell quiet, and his eyes finally closed. ¬†

Greg couldn‚Äôt wake his roommate.¬† He dragged him to bed, wrapped him in blankets, and watched him for hours, terrified he‚Äôd stop breathing.¬† Finally, exhausted, Greg fell asleep in James‚Äôs desk chair.¬† When he awoke the next morning, James was gone.

He found his roommate in the kitchen, brewing a pot of coffee, smiling.

‚ÄúWhat the heck, James?‚Äù¬† Greg stammered.¬† ‚ÄúLast night‚Ä¶ what was that?‚Äù

James eyed Greg strangely.¬† ‚ÄúUm, nothing happened last night?¬† I have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about.‚Äù ¬†

Greg gaped.¬† He reached up and felt the welt over his eye, scraped off dried blood, just to remind himself he hadn‚Äôt dreamed the entire thing. ¬†

‚ÄúYour violin playing!‚Äù he insisted.¬† ‚ÄúThe cave with all the spikes.¬† The metallic lava man‚Ä¶eating you.¬† The steel wool guinea pig?¬† You don‚Äôt remember any of this?‚Äù

James shrugged.¬† ‚ÄúGet a therapist, man.¬† I think you‚Äôre hallucinating.‚Äù

As he turned his back, Greg saw an odd mark on James‚Äôs neck.¬† A bruise the size of a hickey.¬† Grey and shiny, like a smudge of silver metallic paint.

After that day, James became a different person.

Wallflower James, who lived in sweats and anime t-shirts, began wearing polos and styling his dirty-blonde hair.¬† Shy James, all of a sudden, attracted an entourage of frat boys who‚Äôd carry his DJ equipment and chill with him at dive bars.¬† James, who‚Äôd previously spent his free nights reading pulp sci-fi and commenting on classical violin blogs, cultivated a Facebook wall full of photos from drunken club nights, his arms draped around inebriated girls in short dresses.¬† Virgin James, who couldn‚Äôt look a woman in the eye without blushing, now texted Greg three times a week to stay out of the apartment - because James would be occupied there with a one-night playmate. ¬†

‚ÄúI should‚Äôve been supportive, I guess,‚Äù Greg admitted.¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôd been trying to lure him out of his comfort zone.¬† But that cocky womanizer with bottle service - he wasn‚Äôt James.‚Äù ¬†

It was nearly May by then, and Greg had been accepted into MIT for a Master‚Äôs program.¬† He‚Äôd also begun dating his future wife.¬† With finals looming and his roommate inflicted with douchebag brain worms, he was more than happy to spend his days in the library and his nights with his girlfriend.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôd basically moved out already‚Äù, he said.¬† Then, he sighed.¬† ‚ÄúA professor of mine lent me a book, and I‚Äôd forgotten about it.¬† I wanted to return it before the school year ended.‚Äù

Determined to collect the borrowed book, Greg reluctantly returned to the apartment he shared with James - for the last time, he promised himself.¬† But as he approached the door, he felt¬† and heard the familiar rumbling of an EDM bass line. ¬†

*Great*, Greg thought.¬† *He must have a lady friend over.*

To save himself from an unsolicited porn soundtrack, he hooked his earphones up to his iPod and blasted 90‚Äôs hip-hop as he unlocked the door.¬† Quick as he could, he located the book under a pile of menus, then did a round of the common space, picking up random odds and ends he didn‚Äôt want to leave behind. ¬†

Then, *Party Up* by DMX was interrupted by a woman‚Äôs scream.

Greg acted on instinct.¬† He ran to James‚Äôs room and forced his way through the locked door.¬† In the process, his earphones were torn from his ears.¬† And James‚Äôs music dragged him, kicking and screaming, into oblivion. ¬†

He was back in the subterranean cave with jagged spikes and the ghostly greenish glow.¬† The spikes, ever so slowly, moved.¬† Curled and extended, refracting the hazy green light into colors and shades Greg couldn‚Äôt describe with words.¬† The milky-white glue substance extended from spike to spike like a spiderweb, dripping down in thick globules.¬†

And James was there.¬† He stood stock-still, the faceless grey liquid steel man behind him.¬† Embracing him.¬† Moist, metallic tentacles wrapped around his arms and legs and torso, gripping his neck and face like long-fingered hands.¬† Bleeding into his skin.¬† Enveloping him, like a defective superhero‚Äôs suit.¬† The grey man was James.¬† James was the grey man.¬† His eyes were wide, bulging, and empty.

There was a shuffle at his feet.¬† Greg looked down - and doubled over with nausea.¬† What was left of a brown-haired young woman lay on the ground.¬† Her throat had been torn out; her head folded back unpleasantly, unspooled muscles and tendons splayed like streamers. ¬†

A creature buried itself in her chest.¬† In a gruesome second, Greg recognized the thing as the steel wool hamster, now the size of a Rottweiler.¬† Its metal fur curled menacingly like a tangle of barbed wire.¬† It jerked upwards, turned its large face towards Greg.¬† Its putty yellow eyes glowed with malice.¬† It clutched a hunk of red meat between jagged teeth.¬† With a turn of his stomach, Greg realized the chunk of flesh was the dead girl‚Äôs heart. ¬†

The creature tossed its head, swallowing the heart whole.¬† Then, it redirected its rabid attentions towards Greg. ¬†

It lunged. ¬†

Greg, in a fit of survival instinct, grabbed his earbuds and forced them into his ears.¬† James‚Äôs reality-altering EDM creation was blocked out by DMX.

The steel wool monster gnashed its teeth angrily, pressed up against an invisible force field, restrained like a dog on a chain.¬† Greg turned up the volume on his iPod.¬† He knew he didn‚Äôt have much time.¬† Avoiding the living spikes, he found his way to James‚Äôs computer.¬† He tore wires, slammed the laptop against the wall, kicked and stomped and smashed the expensive sound board until it was reduced to a shattered hunk of plastic and rubber and metal. ¬†

Finally, he pulled out his earphones. ¬†

He‚Äôd returned to James‚Äôs room.¬† The air smelled like pennies, with an under-scent of sulfur.¬† The girl‚Äôs destroyed body rested in a pool of blood and entrails.¬† And of course, there was James.

James lay on his back, bloodshot eyes wide and unblinking.¬† As Greg stood over him, he barely seemed to breathe, his chest contracting weakly under a pit-stained tank top.¬† Greg saw a new marking on his arm - a long, blue-grey bruise.¬† Like the hickey on the back of his neck, it caught the light like rusting metal. ¬†

His lips moved.¬† He forced out words. ¬†

‚ÄúNine‚Ä¶hundred.¬† Ninety five.¬† More.‚Äù

Greg fled the apartment.¬† He banged on a neighbor‚Äôs door, called the police.¬† The cops arrived to find the young woman, dead, on the bedroom floor. ¬†

James had disappeared.

\*\*\*\*\*

‚ÄúThe Bushwick concert, that wasn‚Äôt the first,‚Äù Greg insisted.¬† ‚ÄúThere‚Äôve been others, in South America.¬† Ibiza.¬† He keeps moving.¬† Keeps changing his name.¬† He never allows himself to get too popular.¬† It‚Äôs always small shows‚Ä¶ thirty people or less.¬† Because if he were some big celebrity‚Ä¶‚Äù

*He‚Äôd attract too much attention.*¬† Yeah.¬† Fame would be anathema to a creature like DJ Erich Zann.¬† Best to chip away slowly, a couple dozen doomed fans at a time. ¬†

‚ÄúWhat did it mean?‚Äù I asked Greg.¬† ‚ÄúThe last thing he said to you.¬† Nine hundred, ninety five more.‚Äù

Greg met my eyes.¬† *He knew.¬† He knew I knew.* ¬†

‚ÄúThat girl,‚Äù he said.¬† ‚ÄúHer name was Devyn Slade.¬† She‚Äôd been an art student, recently aged out of foster care.¬† And she wasn‚Äôt his first, either.‚Äù

What composure remained on Greg‚Äôs face broke down.

‚ÄúFour other girls went missing, around the same time.¬† Over the next few years the police found all of them, buried in shallow graves on opposite ends of the county.¬† They never connected the dead girls back to James, not officially.¬† But‚Ä¶ well, I did.¬† Because they‚Äôd been mauled.¬† Their hearts torn out of their chests.‚Äù

\*\*\*\*\*

Greg‚Äôs story ended there.¬† Mine‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt.

That night, at The P\*\*\*\*\*, I‚Äôd killed the music. DJ Erich Zann‚Äôs black automaton roadies melted into gelatinous black puddles.

Heart stuck in my throat, stomach in knots, I eased over to a puddle.¬† I extended a toe.

*Bump, bump, bump.*

The bass started up again.¬† The puddles bubbled in time with the music.¬† Gummy arms popped out of the mess, pressed against the ground, formed torsos.

‚ÄúI said, no entry until ten.‚Äù

I whirled, away from the re-emerging humanoids and towards that grating, robotic, alien voice.¬† My pulse pounded in my ears.¬† Beads of perspiration formed on my palms and the back of my neck.¬† My neurons rejected my eyes, and I couldn‚Äôt breathe. ¬†

James Hadley - DJ Erich Zann - stood in front of me, shirtless and bare-faced. ¬†

His flesh - if you could call it flesh - alternated between metallic blue-black patches that refracted light and rotting dark-green tissue that sloughed, hanging off him, dripping foul-smelling liquid.¬† Bits of his arms had disintegrated, revealing silver-stained muscle.¬† He had no nose and no lips and no teeth, just gaping black holes.¬† He was bald; black mold extended across his scalp.¬† His bulging eyes, cloudy-white, stood out in bas relief - and, though I couldn‚Äôt see pupils, I felt fury laser-focused on me. ¬†

Footsteps, behind me.¬† His black putty roadies had stabilized. ¬†

And they‚Äôd blocked all the exits.

What saved my life that night was a combination of luck and the venue owners‚Äô carelessness.¬† I‚Äôd bartended many events there.¬† So I knew, behind the stage, a secret trapdoor and hidden staircase lead to the basement.¬† I knew the basement was accessible via another staircase that opened, through cellar doors, to the street.¬† And I knew the owners constantly forgot to lock said cellar doors.

I ran, then walked, then collapsed into a heap and cried.¬† Then ran again, walked, cried, rinse and repeat, until I sank onto a bench along Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights, legs too numb to move.¬† I should have, I realized then, called the police. ¬†

*The police would‚Äôve thought I was high*, I told myself.¬† *And even if they‚Äôd believed me, it wouldn‚Äôt have made any difference.*

\*\*\*\*\*

Twenty-nine people died at the concert.¬† The youngest was nineteen; the oldest, fifty-one.¬† They were students, baristas, poets, stockbrokers, teachers, biologists, taxi drivers, spouses, and parents.¬† Music lovers, who‚Äôd only wanted to lose themselves for a night. ¬†

Their loved ones were told they‚Äôd all died in an electrical fire, due to rats biting through the wires.¬† The press, outside of a few local outfits, didn‚Äôt pay the incident as much attention as I thought it deserved.¬† Who cares about a few dead hipsters, right?¬† But many people - family and friends, reporters, low-ranking cops and paramedics who‚Äôd seen the aftermath - weren‚Äôt satisfied with the answers they were given.¬† And, as often happens when answers are scarce and higher-ups shut down, certain individuals started asking questions a little louder. ¬†

For instance, if all twenty-nine victims died in a fire, why had autopsies revealed no smoke in their lungs?¬† Why were the bodies they‚Äôd recovered, recovered in pieces?¬† How had an electrical fire torn limbs from sockets with the force of an elephant, or bitten into chests with jaws as wide as a shark‚Äôs?¬† Why was every single recovered torso missing its heart?

And - as a frustrated investigator asked, while showing me a photograph I‚Äôm sure he wasn‚Äôt supposed to reveal - what was the meaning of the words written on the wall?

I stared at the words, scrawled in jagged letters, as though by the nails of a broken and bleeding hand.

I have a I phone 11 and I‚Äôve only had it for a little over a year, it hadn‚Äôt been causing me problems until recently. I started getting a lot of spam calls and I started picking them up for fun, usually it would just be silence or heavy breathing before they hung up. I never really thought much of it until my phone started working weird, the text would just stop W√∂rking suddenly and then the buttons would press themselves deleting my text but never typing new ones. I still thought nothing but then I swear I started too see the text you can‚Äôt change changing. Then it just would randomly beep at me, periodicitly throughout the day. And one day I was on Snapchat just looking at myself in the camera and in the corner an icon like the screen recoding thing but a different outline. But when I scrolled up to see what I hit there was nothing, I scrolled back down and the icon was gone. I checked my canera roll and nothing. After all that HAPPNED I was in the hospital for my mental health but an unrelated problem. I didn‚Äôt have my Phone for 4 days and when I got back it was worse. The keyboard stoped working obviously. Everytime I click it it‚Äôll hit two or the buttion doesnt even work. The letter m often just does not work. It still randomly beeps at me. I have a large amount of storage taken up but my apps definitely don‚Äôt add to that. And now I‚Äôm just generally paranoid about my phone. But if I don‚Äôt have it I don‚Äôt feel safe.

The problems with this
All of this started after I got out of the psych ward. I was in there for 2 ish weeks and had changed antipsychotics 3 times while in. I also smoke weed multiple times a day while on antipsychotics, I have hallucinated before.

I also want to mention that my Alexa was hacked in the past as well, it would wake me up in the middle of the night chanting that I needed too drink tea or coffee. I would often get up unplug it because it wouldn‚Äôt be quiet any other way. I would find it throughout my room hidden away because I‚Äôm scared of it. Aparently I showed my family this and they saw it happen so I‚Äôm pretty sure this actually happened.

1gm79f5,https://www.reddit.com/r/VaushV/comments/1gm79f5/just_want_to_add_my_two_cents_to_vaushs_talk_on/,Just want to add my two cents to Vaush's talk on discipline today,"Vaush is not setting an expectation too high - he is saying that we each need to be the best version of ourselves that we can be. You don't have to be THE strongest, but you do have to be YOUR strongest. If you care about helping the cause and organizing, you will have much more to give when you have taken such good care of yourself that 'your cup runneth over'. 

On vices: be honest and compare 

'me with a nicotine/alcohol/cannabis habit' 

VS 

'me (exactly the same otherwise) but without that habit'

It is objectively true that that habit does not make you stronger or more able than you otherwise will be. I personally love to get high but I stopped in August and found shortly after that I was lacking nothing by giving it up. 

On health: cardiovascular health is the absolute, base-level, FOUNDATION of all aspects of our health, both physical and mental. Your blood's capacity for oxygenating your muscles and brain determines the size of your budget that you work within to do all your work. I started off by running during covid lockdowns, but then I ran so far that I hurt my knee, so then I got a bike from Target (low budget) and this bike has become my medicine. If you take up cardio, you will gain mental clarity and physical endurance that you never knew was possible. Not only that, but your body systems and emotions will be better regulated and you'll be more comfortable in your own skin. Plus, it gets you high on endorphins when you're done, so this is pretty much the one good addiction that exists. 

You don't need to get there all at once. Just make progress in the right direction. To make it sustainable long-term you need to give yourself a smooth ramp from where you are to where you want to be. A ramp that's made of fun - not self-punishment. Begin with something that's small and enjoyable and just have a little more fun each time you come back to it. Let it stretch out and build naturally. That is conditioning - don't burn yourself out! 

I don't know you but if you're in this community I have love for you. As a treat, a little bit of coffee and chocolate are good too.

Saw the doctor again 2 weeks ago.. BP was very high (170/110).  Started blood pressure medication‚Ä¶ lower reading since has been 148/87 (taken with my own monitor at home.

I‚Äôm overweight, but my weight has been stable for a while (1+ year)

Regular doctors and specialists where I live in Tampa, Fl just can't get it to stop.  Finally found out about the chronic cough clinic at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Fl. Had some testing done,  more in December. Wonderful doctor there. Silent reflux is one suspect,  pending some testing to prove it or rule it out. I have some other lung issues and allergy issues besides coughing. 

So I have a question. Coffee. Has everyone here have up on coffee,  or do you still drink it,  and just take meds and just avoid other known foods?",1,1731030302.0,SilentReflux,0,1.0,False

‚ÄúI'm telling you she wouldn't stop talking about it, I kinda have to believe her at that point.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo then it's official?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI mean I haven't seen her place yet, but she spends a lot of time at mine.‚Äù

‚ÄúStrange, I don't want to sound like an asshole, but I thought she was dead. Were you just waiting for her to return home?‚Äù

The bright light of the sun took over the void of the dingy strip mall. Rudy leaned against the wall with her hands on the pockets of her lab coat. Brian just stood there in silence trying to think of what to say. 

‚ÄúIs that coat mandatory?‚Äù Rudy did a twirl as she pushed her short hair to the side.

‚ÄúNo but it makes me look professional, gotta working in a place like this.‚Äù The light conversation continued until a glass door burst open. 

‚ÄúAre you the husband?‚Äù A dental assistant called Brian over as Rudy went back into her office. Brian didn't want to explain himself and just nodded his head. The assistant led him inside as a dentist brought Sofia out. Sofia was stumbling and trying to grab onto someone.

‚ÄúOk she's perfectly fine, the drugs just seemed to hit her hard, oh and no solid foods for three days.‚Äù The dentist went over the essentials as Brian pulled her outside.

‚ÄúWho am I holding on to?‚Äù Sofia looked around confused as he led her to the car. 

‚ÄúIt's me Brian I'm taking you home.‚Äù Sofia climbed into her seat as her face pressed against the window. Brian climbed into the driver's seat before buckling her up tight. As the car got onto the road Sofia shook, grabbing everything to stabilize herself. 

‚ÄúHelp! I'm being kidnapped!‚Äù Sofia shouted as her head rang from side to side. Brian slowed down the car as Sofia grabbed the dash. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not kidnapping you, it‚Äôs me Brian.‚Äù Sofia grabbed onto Brian‚Äôs arm as he pulled into the parking lot. ‚ÄúLook everything is fine, you just left the dentist.‚Äù Sofia grabbed her head trying to figure out what was going on. ‚ÄúI better call your girlfriend down here.‚Äù Sofia turned shocked. Her eyes lit up. Brian called up Doge as she watched Sofia carefully. 

‚ÄúOmg I have a girlfriend.‚Äù Sofia grabbed her face like it was falling apart. Before Brian knew it Doge was behind the car. Brian gestured her around to Sofia‚Äôs side. 

‚ÄúYeah, would you like to see her?‚Äù Sofia almost melted thinking about his words. ‚ÄúJust look out that window.‚Äù Brian couldn‚Äôt help but laugh as he directed her to the window. Brian was enjoying this way too much. As Sofia turned to the window she saw Doge. Doge was just standing there with a broken smile as she looked through the window. Sofia turned back to Brian with a child-like smile. 

‚ÄúWow wow wow, she‚Äôs looking at me, OMG she's so cute.‚Äù Sofia‚Äôs hands grabbed the air in front of her as she screeched like a schoolgirl. Brian reached over and opened her door. 

‚ÄúHi.‚Äù Doge‚Äôs one word and beautiful smile almost made Sofia collapse in place. 

‚ÄúYou should kiss her.‚Äù Sofia started to panic at Brian‚Äôs words. 

‚ÄúI can do that?!‚Äù Sofia turned to Doge as she leaned in. Doge gently kissed her cheek before planting on her lips. Brian couldn't help but film this on his phone. Brian quietly remarked how fun it would be if Liam was here. Sofia pulled away melting in her chair. Doge just stood watching with a bright smile. Sofia's voice shot up like she just hit puberty. ‚ÄúYou're so pretty.‚Äù Sofia leaned out of the car, almost falling into Doge. Brian pulled Sofia back as he leaned over her.

‚ÄúYou better go check on the food, I'll get her upstairs,‚Äù Brian said, unbuckling Sofia. Doge waved goodbye to Sofia before heading inside. 

‚ÄúWhere is she going?!‚Äù Sofia smashed her face against the glass. Brian could help but laugh as he got out of the car. As he opened her door her mood shifted. Sofia was sobbing.

‚ÄúSofia what's wrong?‚Äù Sofia lunged out of the car grabbing onto Brian. Her nails dragged on his shirt.

‚ÄúNo I kissed‚Ä¶.fuck‚Ä¶‚Ä¶don't tell my wife.‚Äù Sofia scrambled to her feet as she scaled the side of the building. Brian just followed her.

‚ÄúWife? Sofia, everything is fine, take my hand.‚Äù Sofia just shook her head as he moved around the building. 

‚ÄúDon't tell Doge I kissed another girl please.‚Äù Brian paused at her words as he watched her secret spy across the wall to the entrance. As onlookers caught sight of her Brian ran up taking her hand and throwing her arm around him. 

‚ÄúWhat's this about a wife?‚Äù Sofia just shook her head at his question. She stumbled onto her feet pulling away from Brian.

‚ÄúWhere's my Doge, Brian where is she?‚Äù Brian reassured her that she was in the apartment as Sofia walked fast up the stairs. Sofia burst into the apartment. Doge, wearing an apron, turned to the door as she was stirring a big pot of pudding. ‚ÄúDoge! I want kisses!‚Äù Doge turned down the burner as she presented herself in front of Sofia. Brian squeezed by them into the apartment as he took the spoon from Doge.

‚ÄúI can take over the‚Ä¶..‚Äù Before Brian could finish his sentence the girls were already gone and their door slammed shut. Brian just quietly walked to their door. ‚ÄúSofia be careful your mouth is still healing!‚Äù Brian heard nothing and went back to stirring the food as a text hit his phone. Amber was on her way over. Brian flicked on music as he moved the pot of pudding into the fridge. Brian's eyes scanned the fridge as he pulled out lettuce, tomato, and beef. Brian pulled together three big sandwiches. As he cut them into triangles a knock hit the door. Brian opened the door as Amber walked inside.

‚ÄúHow's Sofia?‚Äù Brian wrapped the sandwiches in lettuce after buttering the bread. 

‚ÄúLoopy as fuck, but I think she calmed down, her and Doge are having alone time right now.‚Äù Brian stuck a toothpick through each sandwich before placing one in front of Amber. 

‚ÄúOoooo, I didn't know I was dating a five star chef.‚Äù Amber leaned over the counter as they shared a kiss. Brian placed the rest of the sandwiches in the fridge. ‚ÄúI haven't had a lot of homecoming, you know being on the road.‚Äù As Amber dug into her food Brian leaned over the bar.

‚ÄúSo tell me what happened after you left?‚Äù Amber wiped mayo from her lips as she thought about his question. Brian's hair dropped in front of his face as he waited. 

‚ÄúI just drove, and drove, and before I knew it, it had been a year and that turned into five, I knew I couldn't just come home, but I missed everyone.‚Äù She stopped as she took another bite. ‚ÄúI just couldn't think straight.‚Äù Brian moved around the bar as he hugged her. 

‚ÄúHey it's ok, I'm not mad, I'm just curious.‚Äù Brian relaxed her as he sat next to her. ‚ÄúWanna tell me about the tattoos?‚Äù Amber rolled up her sleeve to show off the handful of random tattoos. 

‚ÄúOn her birthday every year I get one of her tattoos, this will be the one year that I don't because I got them all.‚Äù Brian ran his hand over her bare arm tracing the tattoos. Brian dragged his hand up her body until he was rubbing her cheek. ‚ÄúYou know there's not a day I don't think about her.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù Brian's soft words came with a kiss to her cheek. Brian grabbed her hand as he licked mayo off her lips. As they embraced themselves the bedroom door opened. Sofia pulled herself around her door as she shut it.

‚ÄúMan I feel great, and I'm hungry,‚Äù Sofia's words pulled her into the kitchen as she opened the fridge. ‚ÄúOoooo sandwich.‚Äù Brian quickly stood up, closing the fridge.

‚ÄúNo solid food, we made pudding, and there's applesauce in there.‚Äù Brian's words brought sadness.

‚ÄúUhhh ok fine, Amber beer?‚Äù Sofia asked, as she opened back up the fridge.

‚ÄúUmmm, I'm in recovery, so that will be a no.‚Äù Sofia just made a quick duck face as she pulled out an applesauce. 

‚ÄúDo we need to get rid of alcohol in this house?‚Äù Brian asked, as he rubbed her back. Amber sat up biting into her sandwich. 

‚ÄúNo no, it's fine.‚Äù Brian took her words as he walked to the living room pausing the music. Brian's mind quickly jumped to something Sofia said earlier only to be pulled back as Amber dropped into the couch. ‚ÄúHey Brian I see your worry, don't be, I haven't been drunk or high in two years.‚Äù Brian just pulled his hair back before sitting on the couch. Brian laid back as Amber tested on him. 

‚ÄúOh Rudy says high by the way.‚Äù Brian's mind sparked as he remembered something. Amber has a million questions but Brian only knew how to answer two. Sofia just watched them from converse on the couch as she ate her applesauce. As applesauce dribbled from her mouth Doge entered the kitchen.

‚ÄúOh good, you're here, eat this.‚Äù Sofia pulled a sandwich from the fridge. ‚ÄúI need the taste of something that isn't this,‚Äù Sofia said, as she stabbed her sauce. Doge unwrapped her sandwich a bit before taking a monstrous bite. Sofia just watched longingly as she licked her lips. Sofia quickly dragged the food away from her face. ‚ÄúGimmie kisses.‚Äù Sofia grabbed her lips with hers trying to taste as much as possible. 

‚ÄúHey, no solid food!‚Äù Brian shouted from the couch. Sofia just ignored him as they kissed. Amber couldn‚Äôt help but laugh as she watched. 

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs feeding her like a bird.‚Äù Amber‚Äôs words rolled her onto her back with laughter. Brian stopped her laughter with his lips. Everyone stopped in motion as a knock hit the door. Sofia pulled herself off of Doge and walked to the door. As she opened it Liam bolted inside. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm home!‚Äù Liam ran into the living room stopping as everyone looked at him. As he stood still PJ walked out of his room letting Liam pick him up. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be in my room.‚Äù And like that he was off. Standing in the doorway waiting patiently was Janet. 

‚ÄúSorry if he was a handful Mom.‚Äù Sofia hugged her mom tight. Janet turned the hug around forcing her way into the apartment. 

‚ÄúNonsense Liam was great, Diana sweety come give me a hug.‚Äù Doge quickly wiped her face as Janet pulled her into a hug. Janet scanned the room as she saw Amber laying in Brian‚Äôs lap. Janet‚Äôs feet moved as she plopped herself in front of them. ‚ÄúWhere's my hugs?‚Äù Amber just shifted in place.

‚ÄúI don't feel like getting up,‚Äù Amber cooed, with the voice of a damsel in distress. Janet didn‚Äôt even hesitate. She just bent down smothering Amber with her hug. Brian just sat letting everything happen.  ‚ÄúOh my you're so warm Janet.‚Äù Amber rolled onto her front once Janet pulled herself up. 

‚ÄúLiam, come give Grandma a hug!‚Äù There was a silence that followed. Janet stood impatiently waiting until Sofia stepped in. 

‚ÄúLiam, come tell Grandma what you want for your birthday!‚Äù Sofia‚Äôs words made feet move. Liam bolted out of his room as Janet wrapped him up in her arms. As Liam struggled to escape her grasp, conversation continued around them. 

‚ÄúIs it that time of the year already?‚Äù Brian asked, as he sat up more. Amber pulled herself upright as Doge joined them by the couch. 

‚ÄúI think so,‚Äù Doge said, as ate her sandwich. 

‚ÄúOh I don‚Äôt want to leave! But I must! Goodbye love you all!‚Äù Janet said her goodbyes as she set Liam down. Everyone wished her a goodnight as she left. As everything settled down PJ joined the pair on the couch. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting late. I better not overstay my welcome.‚Äù Amber‚Äôs words rolled out as she pet the cat. Brian softly ran his hand through her hair as he looked into her eyes. 

‚ÄúYou could stay here tonight?‚Äù Amber almost ignored his question but his gaze kept her attention. 

‚ÄúBut I should really go to my apartment.‚Äù Brian his arm around her head. 

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt even sleep there, you know I‚Äôd like to see your apartment.‚Äù The conversation became stale as Doge dragged herself to the kitchen. Sofia was sniffing a sandwich laying in front of her. Doge just wrapped it up putting it back in the fridge as she pulled out the pudding. Doge made a little bowl and set it in front of Sofia. 

‚ÄúI want real food,‚Äù Sofia said, in a grumpy tone as she crossed her arms. Doge just stirred the pudding a bit before raising the spoon. 

‚ÄúCome on, show me those lips.‚Äù Doge‚Äôs words make Sofia blush as she tried to look away. As the spoon got closer Sofia opened her mouth letting the pudding enter. Sofia licked up the spoon as Doge pulled it out of her mouth. ‚ÄúGood girl.‚Äù Sofia grabbed her cheeks feeling embarrassed. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk to me like that in front of people.‚Äù Sofia wanted to crawl inside herself but Doge encouraged her to eat a little more. Suddenly Liam appeared out of nowhere. He jumped into Sofia‚Äôs lap. ‚ÄúLiam, don't jump on me right now!‚Äù 

‚ÄúBut I want pudding too.‚Äù As Liam spoke up about his want of pudding Doge gave him a spoonful. 

‚ÄúHey that‚Äôs my pudding!‚Äù Sofia shouted, trying to get Doge‚Äôs attention. But she never lost it as Doge continued to feed both of them. On the other side of the room Amber pulled herself onto her feet. 

‚ÄúI really must go, but I will miss you.‚Äù Brian walked Amber out of the apartment as he reciprocated her words. Brian just hung on the door like a love sick school girl. Brian‚Äôs eyes dropped to the floor. 

‚ÄúYou know I haven't even seen her apartment yet,‚Äù Brian said, as she rubbed the back of his neck. No one responded to him as the strange feeding took place. Brian just walked over leaning on the bar. 

‚ÄúEmpty,‚Äù Doge said, showing the empty bowl. Liam just jumped off his mom‚Äôs lap as he bolted to the couch. Sofia wiped her mouth before turning to Brian. 

‚ÄúListen, sometimes people are just going through things at their own pace.‚Äù Sofia took a pause. Her eyes dropped to the floor as she thought about her words carefully. ‚ÄúAnd sometimes, people are holding onto things that they just have to live with, there are things so powerful that people don‚Äôt say them out loud or that would make them real.‚Äù Sofia‚Äôs speech seemed to come out of nowhere. Before Brian could ask anything she slipped off her stool hiding her face as she moved to the couch. Brian thought about things he did not say out loud for that exact reason. 

Sofia pulled Liam into her lap as cartoons filled his sight. Brian just pulled himself into a stool as he watched Doge join them on the couch. Brian‚Äôs eyes saw them in a perfect frame. He just watched them quietly until Liam spoke up. 

‚ÄúDad, come watch TV with us.‚Äù Brian moved across the floor until he was blocking their view. ‚ÄúDad you're in the way!‚Äù Brian shook his tooshie back and forth. 

‚ÄúAm I in the way now?‚Äù Doge and Sofia couldn‚Äôt help but laugh at Brian‚Äôs tomfoolery as Liam shouted for him to move. Brian shook his legs to the couch as he plopped down next to them ruffling Liam‚Äôs hair. Brian just smiled as he sat comfortably with his family watching TV. 

The time seemed to fly by. Brian was starting to nod off on the couch before Liam jumped on his lap. Liam requested a story before bed and Brian couldn‚Äôt say no. Brian scooped him up in his arms carrying to the bathroom as Sofia ran the bath. Liam removed everything before climbing into the tub. Toys filled the tub as Brian pulled a book out on the toilet. Brian started from where he left off the previous night. 

And there he was proud and tall. With sword in hand he met her gaze with a whimper of strength that immediately faded as he handed her a flower. Wilebee was a tower of a man but a gentle of a person, so gentle that men who were not smart did not fear him and men who were smart respected him. The flower showed off kindness that most men did not show, but his sword showed a braveness that most men tried to be. Alliana was the only girl of poverty in the region. Something connected them. Wilebee made it his mission to make sure she was taken care of and looked after cause if not it would be his job. 

‚ÄúDad? What happen to Alli-a-na‚Äôs parents?‚Äù Brian froze. He just closed the book and pulled his hair back. 

‚ÄúThey're not around bud, she is an orphan.‚Äù Brian poured water over Liam's head with the pitcher. 

‚ÄúOh like you?‚Äù There was no hesitation.

‚ÄúWell yeah, and just like with her and Wilebee, I have a new family now.‚Äù Brian soaped up his hands running it through Liam‚Äôs hair. Once Brian dried his hands he kept reading. 

His job as the town guard was never easy, but she made it worth it. And worth it it was. Her smile may have not lit up a room but it did light up Wilebee's heart. 

When the bath was all done Sofia pulled together pajamas for Liam. PJ made his presence known as he strutted into the room following everyone. PJ couldn't help but chase everyone's feet which didn't last long as Sofia picked up the cat stuffing it under Liam's blanket. The pair wished Liam a goodnight before leaving the room. As Brian stepped back he noticed a very absent Doge. 

‚ÄúYou turning in?‚Äù Brian asked, as Sofia moved to the couch. Sofia flicked on the television as he pet the seat next to her.

‚ÄúNaw come, let's watch something.‚Äù Brian followed her words as he sank in next to her. Sofia scrolled through the endless void of movies and shows as they engaged in small talk. Prying eyes watched from an open door. Doge stood silent in her doorway watching as the pair relaxed on the couch. Doge just pulled herself inside hiding her faint smile. 

One movie later and the pair fell asleep in their arms. One sleep later and the pair woke up in each other's arms. Sofia and Brian pulled themselves awake as the sun crept in. A couple coffees later and they were outside on the balcony. Brian was leaning over the edge watching cars pass by. 

‚ÄúHey I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have kept that from you.‚Äù Her words fell on silence as Brian just pulled himself up. ‚ÄúI shouldn't keep thinking I can do everything myself.‚Äù Sofia set her cup down before resting on the rail. 

‚ÄúIt's probably my fault for thinking that you were completely fine and I was the only one struggling.‚Äù The two shared simple words as more bodies woke. Doge dragged her tired body to the patio door. 

‚ÄúHey sorry I didn't come to bed last night.‚Äù Sofia‚Äôs words came with a hug and a kiss as she pulled Doge into her lap on a patio chair. Doge just rubbed her tired eyes. ‚ÄúSo you and Amber have plans today?‚Äù Brian pulled around a chair sitting in it backwards.

‚ÄúI guess she just said I'll see.‚Äù Sofia rolled her eyes as she pulled Doge‚Äôs hair away from her face. Everyone seemed lost in thought until Sofia spoke.

‚ÄúI want to take you out.‚Äù Brian turned as Doge perked up, surprised. ‚ÄúI want to give you the perfect day.‚Äù Doge just stumbled on her words trying to get anything out. Sofia turned Doge to face her. ‚ÄúHey, will you let me pamper you today?‚Äù Doge looked like she wanted to faint. 

‚ÄúI..I‚Ä¶I‚Ä¶‚Äù Brian could have easily left. This moment was beautiful though and he wanted to enjoy it. Sofia pulled Doge‚Äôs hair behind her ears as she gazed into her eyes. 

‚ÄúI'm sorry if I've been neglecting you,‚Äù Sofia said, as she rubbed Doge's cheek. Brian could take the hint and decide now was his time to leave, closing the door behind him. The blood in Doge's face spiked. ‚ÄúYou're so cute you know that.‚Äù Sofia brushed a finger over Doge‚Äôs trembling lips. Doge‚Äôs body became stiff as she bit her lip. Without  notice Doge stood up, turning away from Sofia. 

‚ÄúI'd love to go out with you today! I have to get ready!‚Äù Doge bolted inside with her yelling before running back to the door. ‚ÄúThank you for the compliment! I think you're cute too!‚Äù Doge smashed her eyes shut as she yelled at Sofia. Doge just rushed inside eager to get ready. Sofia just tested her chin on her fist. 

‚ÄúHaa she's so adorable,‚Äù Sofia said, as she traced circles on the table with her finger. 

An hours time passed as everyone got ready. Doge pulled her hair back into a ponytail tail letting her bangs float above her eyes. She pulled on a tank top under an orange flannel. Blue jeans perfected the look. In the same vein Sofia pulled a high ponytail high on the back of her head. A sleeveless light blue shirt with horizontal cuts crawled up the stomach covering her chest as she threw a dress coat over it. Dress pants come on next before applying light make up. One room over Brian just brushed his hair and pulled on a black T-shirt and black jeans. Lastly, he pulled on a simple coat with a zipper. Oh but there was one room left. Liam danced back and forth on his feet as he pulled on a graphic T of a bear and cargo shorts. 

‚ÄúOk, ready!‚Äù Everyone shouted as they left their rooms. Everyone‚Äôs eyes dropped to Liam who was looking up at everyone.

‚ÄúWhere are we going?‚Äù Brian didn't know exactly how to answer. Sofia just straightened herself out before grabbing Liam's hand.

‚ÄúWe are going to have a day out, today it's all about you and Doge.‚Äù Sofia shot Brian a look reassuring him everything was fine. Once everyone hit the stairs they split. Brian waited on the street as everyone else piled into the minivan. Brian just watched them leave. 

It took twenty long boring minutes until the van arrived. Amber honked the horn grabbing Brian's attention. He smashed himself into his seat as she slammed her feet on the gas. Brian held on to whatever he could as they left the apartment complex in their dust. 

‚ÄúSo where are we going?‚Äù Amber just kept her eyes on the road almost ignoring Brian.

‚ÄúWouldn't you like to know.‚Äù Amber puckered her lips out teasing him as she pulled onto the highway. The pair drove past a small restaurant as another van pulled into the parking lot. 

Sofia unbuckled Liam as Doge grabbed their purses. They headed inside the restaurant as Liam's eyes lit up. It was noisy but calm at the same time. As they were seated the waiter brought Liam crayons. 

‚ÄúI'm really glad you're here with me,‚Äù Sofia said, grabbing Doge‚Äôs hand. Doge just looked at her menu with a faint smile as she decided on what to order. Liam traced around a picture of a dog with the color red as another dog made isn't known. 

The van stopped outside what looked like a junkyard. As Brian looked out his window a dog jumped at him. 

‚ÄúRelax, Scaps is safe,‚Äù Amber said, as she grabbed Brian's hand. As he left the car, Scraps leaped into his arms. The happy dog wanted all the attention in the world and Brian pushed him to the floor scratching his belly giving it to him. 

‚ÄúWhere exactly are we?‚Äù Amber just pulled Brian along as she explained everything.

‚ÄúI go to this program here, basically addicts smash stuff as they get out all their frustrations.‚Äù As they entered the building a voice welcomed them.

‚ÄúAmber! Good to see you.‚Äù Standing behind the counter was a big man with big mutton chops. His voice was loud and booming.

‚ÄúHello Herman, this is my boyfriend Brian.‚Äù Herman reached over the counter, almost squeezing Brian's hand. ‚ÄúI was wondering if we could get some alone time in the back.‚Äù Herman pulled back thinking. Before he could decide Amber slipped him a bill.

‚ÄúAlright then just be careful,‚Äù Herman said, as he opened the back door for them. Amber led Brian through the stacks of junk cars and electronics. They moved into a clearing as Amber pulled up some safety goggles. As they covered their eyes Amber pulled up a sledgehammer. 

‚ÄúOk just think about everything that's on your mind right now, then smash one of these.‚Äù Amber handed him the hammer as she pointed at a TV laying on the ground. He stood hesitant, not sure exactly what to do. Amber shouted encouraging him to take his emotions out on the electronics. 

Brian pulled the hammer up as he thought about the eggs he burned, the cat poop he's had to clean up, and the traffic he's been stuck in. As he smashed his hammer into the screen glass shot everywhere. He felt all this weight rush off of him in an instant. He took another swing as Amber jumped for joy. Brian pulled the hammer over his head like it was a spear as she screamed out his emotions. Amber dragged another TV into view as sports changed into cartoons.

A server seemed to be watching patiently as she swapped the channel on the TV. Liam's eyes flicked above him as he watched a familiar show play in the restaurant. Sofia waited for a refill of her drink as Doge picked at her salad. 

‚ÄúSo Ricky has been calling me, he wants me to come back to work.‚Äù Sofia paused her bite as she turned to Doge. ‚ÄúI don't know, it sounds like he needs me, but I don't know.‚Äù Sofia just grabbed her hand.

‚ÄúBut you don't need him, I don't think you should think about it anymore, besides did he even ask about Kitty, did he call her?‚Äù Doge sat up more. 

‚ÄúNo, he just called me.‚Äù The waiter interrupted them refilling their drinks before Doge continued. ‚ÄúAnd I don't want to go back, I shouldn't have to, I don't have to do what other people say.‚Äù Doge‚Äôs voice picked up as Sofia tried to relax her. 

‚ÄúOk calm down sweetie, no one is making you do anything, your life is up to you.‚Äù Doge relaxed as she remembered where she was. Her face blushed as she stared at her plate. Sofia softly whispered an add on to her sentence as Doge wanted to crawl into own shirt like a turtle. 

‚ÄúI'm done, I'm done.‚Äù Liam raised his empty plate excitedly waiting for what was gonna happen next. ‚ÄúWait, I have to pee.‚Äù Doge took Liam to the bathroom as Sofia walked to the counter to pay. As Sofia rifled through her purse a voice called out to her. 

‚ÄúSofia?‚Äù She paused as this voice pulled her back to another time. ‚ÄúIt is you.‚Äù Standing a few feet away was a tall, lengthy woman dressed in a beautiful black dress. Her hair was pulled into a tall bun. Her eyes scanned Sofia as she found her card. ‚ÄúDo you remember me?‚Äù Sofia didn't infact remember her. How could she forget? 

‚ÄúLike I would forget you, Nadia, you stood me up at prom.‚Äù Sofia's voice was a bit shrill. 

‚ÄúWoah, that's harsh, didn't expect a scene, damn way to make me feel bad.‚Äù Sofia paid for her food, keeping her eyes off Nadia. ‚ÄúI'm sorry I was never as brave as you.‚Äù These words angered Sofia. She wanted to burst out with the worst things she could think of saying until another voice caught her attention. 

‚ÄúMommy I'm done!‚Äù Liam ran to Sofia as Doge followed. 

‚ÄúHe just won't sit still,‚Äù Doge said, as she ruffled his hair. Sofia kissed Doge as Nadia‚Äôs eyes over scammed them. 

‚ÄúWow you look like a happy family.‚Äù Nadia‚Äôs words fell flat as she walked to the exit. Liam couldn't help but ask who that was. Sofia's ears lost all noise as she caught a glimpse of herself. In the reflection of the metallic wall she saw all three of them standing together. Her mind froze on the happy family that was them. 

‚ÄúWho was that?‚Äù Liam asked again, bringing Sofia's mind back. 

‚ÄúJust someone I went to school with,‚Äù Sofia said, as she pushed Liam towards the exit. 

 ‚ÄúWhere are we going next!‚Äù Liam wanted to run out the building but Sofia held onto his shirt. 

‚ÄúYou are going to the park.‚Äù Liam was jumping at Joy as a familiar face stood at the door. Kitty pulled off the door as they exited the building. 

‚ÄúGuess who's taking you to the park?‚Äù Kitty asked, as she threw up jazz hands. Liam hugged Kitty before trying to run ahead of her. Sofia pulled out a twenty and handed it to her. ‚ÄúI'll bring him home safely.‚Äù And just like that Liam and Kitty were gone.

I know you can mail frozen goods but I know there are different restrictions on cooked meat/eggs/dairy. I wont be home cooking anything it will all be store bought, packaged.
Im trying to see if certain items are ok since they are store bought.

Heres some ideas for things I might send
-taco shells, taco seasoning, tortillas 
- frozen pork tamales, from the store again I wont be home cooking anything.
-various salsas specifically mrs.renfros brand
-poptarts
-chips (fritos, funyons, crackling)
-100 grand candy bars
-little debbies cakes

I spend 98% of my time by myself, doing life tasks such as shopping, exercise and hobbies by myself, I have learnt to accept it and just enjoy doing what I want, not having to cater for others, however the feeling of doing it all alone is the issue. I want someone to come look round shops with me, I want someone to join in on a run with me, someone to sit by the river or just have a wander round. Cook with etc. 

I find the day to day very boring and lonely, the classic Disney meeting of two characters is so far from reality that just going out everyday and putting yourself in a day to day situation is not enough for anything to come from it. So the cycle continues. 

People don‚Äôt talk, girls don‚Äôt seem interested, I say I enjoy doing these things but it would be nice to have a conversation with someone who doesn‚Äôt feel forced to speak back of us waiting for you to move on.. speaking to a cashier at a shop or the coffee girl who is making my take away tea is pretty much all the interaction I get, is definitely taking its toll, especially as I thought moving to a new-ish city will present many opportunities for meeting people, but that fades with every passing day. 

So idk what to do, suck it up as I have done for as long as I can count, or try a Reddit post and see what advice can be helpful.

1gm71bl,https://www.reddit.com/r/dandruff/comments/1gm71bl/really_good_dandruff_removal/,Really good dandruff removal ,"So I've been struggling with dandruff for a long time now and I've tried everything under the sun, but nothing worked. Except for this. I used flaxseed and aloe gel ( also with a shampoo brush) and it removed almost all my itching! It's better than the dandruff treatment at the salon. Here's the recipe: 
You need 
Flaxseed
Aloe gel or aloe plant 
Water 
Shampoo brush 
Hair dye brush/ oil applicator ( optional )
A blender
And a saucepan 
First- 
Take 2 parts flaxseed and 1 part water and put it into the saucepan 
Optional - add 1 ginger knob and 2-3 cloves ( whole ) into the water 
Second- boil for 30 mins, and every 15 mins, check the consistency. It should be as that of an egg white. If it's too loose, let it boil longer. If it's too hard, put it back on the stove, add some water little by little and keep stirring until the eggish consistency ( but remember, if you are using an oil applicator,it best to have it a bit watery.)
Third- after boiling, let it cool for an hour. 
Fourth- after cooking, you can either strain it with a cheescloth, coffee filter or a fine mesh strainer to just get the gel, no seeds because trust me, I've done it without straining and the seeds got everywhere and even ruined the clothes I was wearing. 
Fifth- pour your gel into a container if you plan on using it in the future.
Sixth- take the aloe leaf ( if using leaf) and peel it in half, then scoop out the gel-like part inside ( only use one leaf )
Seventh- put that ( aloe ) in a blender and blend it until it's nice and foamy ( if you are using aloe gel, skip the fifth and sixth parts ) 
Eighth- if using aloe gel, put 1 parts aloe gel and 2 parts flaxseed gel ratio. If using homemade aloe gel ( foamy ) pour the foam into whichever container you have stored your flaxseed gel and mix it thoroughly.
Ninth- brush your hair thoroughly.
Tenth- if you are using an oil applicator, pour your mix into it and start applying from your roots to your ends. If you are using hair dye brush, dip it as you would hair dye and apply from your roots to your ends. If you are only using your hands, scoop up the gell with your hand and apply it from your roots to your ends. 
Eleventh- once you have applied it thoroughly, put on a shower cap and wait 15min to an hour. 
Twelfth- wash it off in the shower and also use your shampoo applicator and/or hands to really get all the dandruff out 
Note: while the shampoo applicator is good, I used my hands more and I have nails so it helped soothe my itching faster. Ofc this might not work for you, but I thank mainly my hands. 
Thirteenth( optional, I did not do it )- you can use shampoo and conditioner regularly.
Fourteenth- wrap your hair up in a towel or blow dry or any other way of drying it.
Now this is mostly it but there is something else I have to add
If you didn't use the shampoo and conditioner like me, you might get residue on your scalp and locks. I took that out with a lice comb.

Anyway that is it, you can try this recipe just with the flaxseed also, that works amazing too, also warning, the aloe mixed with the flaxseed smelled so bad when I did it, maybe it won't smell bad with pre made aleo gel, but I don't know. If you tried it, please tell me how it worked! Thanks for reading this!",1,1731029664.0,dandruff,0,1.0,False

I am currently a 3rd year student nurse and on my second last placement ever. I have been struggling with thoughts of uncertainty when it comes to nursing the whole duration of my course however, it is getting worse as the time of qualifying gets closer. I have been unlucky in placement environments and only had 1 acute ward placement. I find that the nurses are reluctant to show me how to do anything and when I don't know how to do something they are shocked as I am in year 3.. how am I supposed to know if no one will show me? An example of this being the nurses making up IV medications and I asking if I could help and them saying no and that I have to go help the nursing assistants with teas and coffees for patients. In no way am I saying that is beneath me either because I am happy to do so but when I am missing out on learning opportunities it's not very fair. This coupled with patients being abusive to me and some of the staff in placement environments being the most horrible people I have ever encountered I don't think nursing is for me anymore. 

  
So with that being said, I am wondering if anyone has left nursing and what their experience was? Or if anyone can give me words of encouragement to stick it out and that it gets better? I am so ready to throw the towel in. ",2,1731029536.0,NursingUK,0,1.0,False

Something with three walls and a floor that will take up about half of a small bookshelf, and will be a replica of those old Victorian ""cabinet of curiosity"" rooms, the ones that are essentially a curio cabinet scaled up to full room size. As part of that, I want to put in a wood floor, with actual wood.

From what I'm reading, it looks like a relatively simple matter; pick your wood, stain it, let the stain dry, glue it down, trim the overhang at the edges. Possibly color the sides with a dark marker before placing them to give the effect of deeper floor cracks. It seems like, as long as I don't put too much glue on and I take my time with placement, it shouldn't be all that difficult. But I have this nagging feeling that there's a reason there are non-wood alternatives, and maybe it isn't that simple. Are the alternatives (paper, peel-and-stick premade wood floors, etc) just for convenience, and this is a simple-but-tedious task, or is there some hidden trouble waiting to happen? 

Does anyone have a recommendation for where to get 1:12 scale wood flooring, while I'm here? I know you can use coffee stirrers or popsicle sticks, but I think I want to get something made to be more consistent.

We woke up together this morning and he slinked off my chest to go watch his dad make coffee. We were making breakfast and I noticed he wasn't rubbing around our legs like usual. So I started looking around for him and didn't see him in any of his regular spots so I started shaking treats. He didn't come so my partner and I started to panic and search for him in hiding spots. I checked by his cat tree and noticed the window he watches birds from had the screen busted through. He was gone. 
It's 8pm now and he's been gone since 11am. I've been outside all day shaking his treats and telling the neighbors. I found 4 other cats including one pregnant orange stray who kept eating the food we've left out for him. 
At 2pm I fucking saw him, my neighbor and I were searching and spotted him right behind our garage/the neigbors fence!! I shook his treats but he didn't come, so my neighbor started coming around into his yard in case he came in the fence. Which he tried to do, but got scared of our footsteps because the leaves are crunchy and took off into the thick bamboo that another neighbor uses as a fence. He just took of into it so quickly. I was so close to him and I didn't get him. I can't get the image of his fuzzy belly and chubby legs hopping off into the unknown. 
My neighbor and I eventually broke through the bamboo but he wasn't on the other side , which is a huge park like yard. At the end of the huge yard is the busiest street.  I hope he's just still hiding. 
It's very cold out now and he has to be so hungry. 

I have his litterbox outside, I've set up 2 live traps, with his food inside and his blankies over them. He is chipped and we've posted about him on nextdoor. Is there anything else we can do? 
How do I stop looking and just go inside? Just take a shower? Just eat dinner? Just fall asleep without him on my face? I can't fathom doing any of that right now 


UPDATE: I immediately caught the pregnant orange cat, which is great because now she won't be eating the food for Pepper. But now what do I do with her? I can't just let her out because she keeps creeping around our house, marking territory and eating his food. I can't bring her in my house because she is aggressive in her fear. It is too late to drop her off somewhere. I can't just leave her in the trap overnight, what do i do with her ? I just wanted her to be Pepper ",0,1731029435.0,CatAdvice,1,0.5,False

### Part 7: A Debrief Over Coffee

Mouse Capone and Archimedes Featherstone found themselves in a small, quiet caf√© tucked away in a corner of Lower Manhattan. It was far from the towering skyscrapers and the high-stakes world of Monkey Tycoon, and for once, that was a relief.

The air smelled of roasted beans and pastries, a stark contrast to the tension-filled office they had just left behind. They sat at a corner table, away from the few patrons scattered throughout. A steaming cup of coffee sat between them as Archimedes carefully adjusted his spectacles and studied Mouse‚Äôs expression.

""You handled yourself well back there,"" Archimedes said, his voice calm and measured. ""Considering the situation, we could‚Äôve lost much more.""

Mouse let out a long breath, leaning back in his chair. ""Maybe. But we didn‚Äôt win, did we?""

Archimedes took a thoughtful sip of his coffee. ""Winning, in this line of work, is often less about the clean outcome and more about surviving with your principles intact.""

Mouse scoffed, staring out the window at the bustling city beyond. ""Iver Swan. Who would‚Äôve thought a swan could be so slick? He played us like amateurs, Arch.""

""He's clever, no doubt,"" Archimedes agreed, his fingers tracing the rim of his cup. ""But he's playing a long game. He has the schematics, but they're no good to him until he can find the right buyers‚Äîand that takes time. Time we can still use to our advantage.""

Mouse frowned. ""Monkey Tycoon didn‚Äôt seem too thrilled with that idea. He‚Äôs thinking about what Swan will do with those documents once they hit the market. That‚Äôs years of work gone in a flash. And the money? We‚Äôre talking tens of millions‚Äîmaybe more.""

Archimedes nodded slowly, setting his cup down. ""True. But consider this‚ÄîSwan is sitting on a ticking time bomb. He‚Äôs got to find a way to offload the information without making too many waves. He can‚Äôt cash in without drawing attention, and that means he‚Äôs going to be cautious, maybe even sloppy.""

Mouse rubbed his temples. ""But he still won. And we were sent in to protect that briefcase, not let some smooth-talking swan make off with it.""

Archimedes smiled faintly. ""Did he win? Or did we buy enough time to shift the board in our favor? Swan‚Äôs got a piece of the puzzle, but he doesn‚Äôt have all of it. There‚Äôs still a chance to turn this around.""

Mouse paused, looking at the professor. ""You think there‚Äôs more to this than we know, don‚Äôt you?""

Archimedes leaned forward slightly. ""The Temporal Callosum project wasn‚Äôt just about those documents, Mouse. It‚Äôs about the idea behind them. Monkey Tycoon can adapt. He always does. What Swan took‚Äîit‚Äôs valuable, yes, but it‚Äôs not the end. It‚Äôs a spark, nothing more.""

Mouse sat quietly, processing the professor's words. He knew Archimedes was right. Swan might have the documents, but the bigger game was still being played, and the final move hadn‚Äôt been made yet.

""Okay,"" Mouse said, leaning forward. ""What‚Äôs the next step? We just let him walk away with those plans?""

""For now,"" Archimedes replied. ""We regroup, keep our eyes on the broader picture. Swan will surface again, and when he does, we‚Äôll be ready. We don‚Äôt need to catch him now. We just need to outlast him.""

Mouse chuckled softly. ""You make it sound simple.""

Archimedes smiled, his wise old eyes twinkling. ""It never is. But if anyone can handle it, it‚Äôs you and the crew.""

The two sat in silence for a moment, letting the weight of their mission settle between them. Outside, the city roared on, indifferent to the high-stakes game they were caught up in. But inside that caf√©, for just a brief moment, the world felt a little smaller, a little more manageable.

Mouse leaned back and took a sip of his own coffee. ""You‚Äôre right, Arch. We‚Äôll be ready when Swan makes his next move. But next time, I‚Äôm making sure we‚Äôre the ones who get the last laugh.""

Archimedes nodded in agreement, and together, they sat, silently preparing for whatever came next.",1,1731029328.0,u_hdfidelity,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been using around a pack of Velo 10 mg nicotine pouches (UK) every day since I used them to quit smoking in late 2020. My decision has come mostly out of a growing deep paranoia about my health and a great desire to free myself from the pouches clutch.

I haven‚Äôt quit cold Turkey but instead started using 6mg On! Pouches for the last week until today, where I transitioned down to 4mg nicotine gum. 

I spent the entire morning at my office job in a complete malaise, brain fog, unable to concentrate on anything. As the day went on my irritation has grown to the point where literally the smallest things have been able to set me off. That and a complete inability to sit still, my muscles are constantly tensing , specifically in the lower body.

I‚Äôve really come to consider these things the absolute devil. When I smoked, there was at least the requirement for me to get up and stop whatever I‚Äôm doing, not to mention the drastically lower nicotine content. The way in which nicotine pouches are able to perfectly complement the consumption of literally every enjoyable aspect in life is completely overwhelming: sitting down for a movie or video game, pouch; starting a piece of work, pouch; start of car journey, pouch; just had my first drink at the pub or night out, pouch; finishing a task, pouch. Hell, like cigs, I even use the little fuckers to regulate my bowels, my morning ritual for the last 4 years consisting of a post coffee Velo and a shit. Not to mention the craving for one post meal, I‚Äôve actually gained weight in the last few years because I know that I‚Äôll be able to have and enjoy a pouch far more if I‚Äôve filled my stomach recently.

But I‚Äôve come to completely resent the grip these bastards have had on my life, I  don‚Äôt even get the same social benefits from them I would get when I smoked. At least I got to chat to fit Alt girls in smokers circles when I smoked.

Anyways, this is the most committed I‚Äôve been to a quit since I started all the way back. It definitely becomes easier to start the process when you feel disdain for every additional pouch you stuff into your upper lip. Would really like to hear from any UK folks who‚Äôve quit or are in the process, who could share their experiences. I‚Äôve seen some chat on here about grind coffee pouches, which I think I could really benefit from, but haven‚Äôt seen anything like that for sale here. If anyone could share any additional strategies I‚Äôd be most appreciative, I‚Äôve recently started a new graduate job and I‚Äôm very concerned with limiting the impact my quitting might have on my job.",3,1731029056.0,QuittingZyn,0,1.0,False

Does this sound like a good itinerary? Is there any specific activities you would/wouldn‚Äôt recommend?

My time in Antigua is basically split up into 4 half days (so ~2 days), I am just planning to spend my time by walking around to see the Architecture. Will this fill my time or is there any specific activities I should do in Antigua?

Also, any good restaurant recs in Panajachel?

When instantly putting them on they seem a little bit under XM4 ANC performance, but after a few seconds I feel like they adapted and maximize its ANC performance, and then theyre superior than the XM4. its like at first XM4 cancell 85% and QC Ultra 80%, but then after those seconds QC Ultras get to a 90% cancellation.

Anyone can tell me if its normal? Or it should be a HUGE difference between these two? Or im just crazy, Just goy my QC Ultra a few hours ago, so it would be of help.

Prior to this we were friends and were seeing other people because neither of us thought the other one was interested and put it down to just friendship for a long time (denial is great). One of the people that he was seeing before me left town about 2 months before we started dating and before we made it official, there was a mention that she was due to visit again for a fly by trip and they'd meet and go for a coffee. I wasn't okay with it but said yes because we were unofficial and weren't sure what was happening at the time. He told me afterwards, a few months into us dating that they never met for coffee because he told her that he was now seeing someone (me) and it wouldn't be appropriate. I've recently found out that the reason they didn't meet for coffee was because she never came back at all. I feel a bit caught off guard and confused. I know that my bf loves me very much and his actions and behaviours always follow this through. We've just celebrated our one year anniversary and I've met and stayed at his parents, met his friends, everything is a green flag. So I'm really confused by why he would just not say that they didn't meet cos she didn't visit. I know they don't talk anymore and she's moved abroad permanently so my question is, it even worth raising? Why would he give this reason and not the real reason they didn't meet?

Initially, it felt strange not scrolling through the endless stream of news and updates as soon as I woke up. Instead, I used that time to meditate for a few minutes, make myself a coffee, and enjoy the quiet moments before diving into the day. By the end of the week, I noticed a significant drop in my stress levels and a greater sense of calm throughout my mornings.

  
This small change made me realize how dependent I was on my phone to fill every free moment. It was almost automatic to grab it without thinking. Freeing up those early morning hours encouraged me to be more intentional with how I spend my time. Now, I can actually enjoy looking out the window and soaking in the morning light rather than diving into the digital noise.

  
It's still a work in progress, but replacing that morning scroll with a more mindful routine feels like a personal victory. I'm curious if any of you have tried something similar and what your experience was like. Have you discovered any other benefits or challenges after unplugging during specific parts of your day?",7,1731028422.0,nosurf,2,1.0,False

Karena pada nganggur malem jumat ga ngapa2in kita akhirnya memutuskan buat spend the night ngopi di cafe deket hotel. Seperti biasa obrolan yg awalnya masalah remeh temeh berubah jadi topik berat setelah lewat jam 11 malem. 

Nah, semalem kami ngobrol masalah versi lain Indonesia, yaitu Indonesia Federal. Kebetulan di tim gw ada 2 kubu yaitu Federalis dan Unitarian (It's okay, iki bukan makar kok, obrolan tim gw kalo ga kerja emang kadang kontroversial tp cm penggelitik otak doang).

Gw sendiri dari dulu cenderung lean to federalism than unitary. Kami ngobrol dan berdebat sambil kasih skenario2 buat saling refute dan counter-refute. Tapi ternyata ada salah satu hal yg bikin gw dumbfounded sama landasan pikir temen gw yg sama2 federalis. 

Dia mendasarkan pilihannya pada fakta bahwa selama orde baru unitary ga bagus buat daerah asalnya, karena seloha menjadi anak tiri: Fair. Daerah asal dia memiliki konsep etno-religi yang cukup kental, dan ini hanya bisa dijaga eksistensinya dalam kerangka federalis ala US: Fair. Walaupun demikian dia merasa porsi pengaturan keuangan nasional untuk saat sudah tepat, mengingat pemerintah daerah itu kompetensi dan integritasnya naudzubillah: Fair (btw ini menyambung SWF Prabowo kemarin, dia lebih rela SDA daerahnya dikelola SWF ini daripada dikelola pemdanya). Tapi dengan kuasa lebih bisa mengatur internalnya dia merasa daerahnya akan lebih ""nyaman"" (kata dia) karena orang tidak akan dipaksa hidup dalam cara hidup orang2 di Jawa pada umumnya dan Jakarta pada khususnya, tl;dr ada hal2 yg secara budayanya acceptable tapi ga bisa dilakukan karena ini menurut pusat masuk ke SARA: Fair.

Tapi, yg bikin gw kaget adalah ketika lawan kami (unitarian) nanya: ""Lu sadar kan kalo yg lu minta ini beneran dilakukan, maka Bali bisa legalize LGBT dalam semalam dan lu ga akan bisa ngelakuin apapun? Batam tiba2 akan bikin casino? Indonesia ini tiap2 daerah punya moral guidance masing2. Lu udah siap menerima kalo lu nanti harus hidup merantau di daerah yg hukumnya 180 derajat berbeda dari rumah lu?""

Gw pribadi udah mikir ttg hal ini dari lama dan justru inilah yg bikin gw mendukung federalisme, karena pikiran nakal dan jahat gw adalah 'nanti akan ada negara2 bagian yg bisa gw kunjungi dan jadi safe haven gw buat ngelakuin hal2 yg ga diperbolehkan di negara bagian asal gw.' (Not unlike orang indo yg cari safe haven ke Thailand). Masalahnya adalah temen gw federalis tadi kaya kena stun beberapa saat sebelum akhirnya bisa jawab pertanyaan ini.

Nah gw pengen tau nih di sini ada kaum2 unitarian dan federalist ga? Menurut redditors gmna? You're all smart. I wanna hear your opinion abut this.",17,1731027978.0,indonesia,30,0.84,False

   * this year: 1.5-2 hours zone 2 training / week, weight lifting 5x/week
* mental health: 
   * last year: great, not currently seeing a counselor but in a very good place most of the time, not too much stress
   * this year: same

  
So here I am a year later and happy to report still feeling great. Notable changes were dropping my beta blocker (which I was extremely scared to do!) and ceasing to take supplements. Note: ending beta blocker was under supervision and recommendation of my cardiologist, not YOLOing here. I'm also drinking a lot more coffee but not like a troubling amount.

I still don't know what the secret sauce is but If anything I am doing it might be the extremely consistent exercise routine? I literally don't miss a day unless traveling. Maybe just good biological luck after almost a decade of bad luck. 

  
Anyway, thought you all mind find this interesting. Cheers!",3,1731027743.0,PVCs,2,1.0,False

Jerry endorses an energy drink he has never had & is caught with coffee.,"Kramer - gets salsa labeled ""hot"" does a Kramer freak out. Goes to Jackie, they make a case about ""hot"" meaning reasonably hot.

Torn between either: George wants to be let go because the severance package is great but HR wants him to stay. OR George continues to show up but has no duties anymore but gets a paycheck.

Elaine's boyfriend is like Fabio with long luxurious silky shiny hair. She loves to play with it.. when she asks what he does he is oddly secretive about his routine saying he doesn't want it to get out. He even locks his bathroom cabinet and brings a locked overnight bag when he stays over. She goes to great lengths to try and figure it out. 

Jerry's paid to endorse Power Buzz, a new energy drink. They get on his case for drinking water during his routine and being seen drinking coffee at Monk's. He tries the drink and is buzzed.

It ends up where Kramer as usual doesn't get a payout but the company agrees to change its recipe and remove a specific hot pepper from it. 

It turns out that pepper and the juicy part of the salsa was crucial to Elaines BFs hair routine. He freaks out when he hears the news. The light bulb goes off and Elaine hoards the last jars of salsa before they're recalled out of spite.  Without it he gets dry and frizzy. 

It ends with Elaine with great hair dumping him.

And it's letting myself hide, when I need to, instead of pushing myself to look ""normal"" and ""business as usual"".

Avinash and her ""popat"" thing were all also going on side.. it kept going on and unfortunately today Vivian became the receiving end of it. I am not  his fan but him being biased towards Avinash wasn't even a fraction of the issue. It was BB that got her. BB is a show for mental strength endurance, strategies and mind games and she is a victim of it. I hope she seeks help and her husband was right that she is not made for the game. I hope BB lets her go out of the game in peace. 

Also, BB should change the theme of the show from food politics to something else. Biasedness is another issue that now even HMs have started to notice with the constant taunts. I can see people giving up already like Bagga cried in the episode and said he is done. Chum mentioned in livefeed that she wants to go to her home. I hope BB diverts from food and moves to regular tasks and stop rubbing the ""laadla"" thing and make one guy the enemy for HMs and be a receiving end of this misdirected anger.

I made 2 avocado toasts with a fried egg today and I ended up only eating 1 because I couldn't stomach it or became repulsed lol

Afterward, I got myself a coffee and ended up drinking 3/4 of it.

For some context, I'm a 33 year old male living in Nottingham. My girlfriend (who coincidentally also has RCPD) and I travelled down to London for the procedure with Dr lucy Hicklin at the Nuffield Parkside hospital in Wimbledon in November 2024 after countless hours research into the procedure i chose to go woth Dr Lucy purely on a financial basis. I have self funded the procedure with no medical insurance. I thought I'd document the aftereffects to help better educate anyone thinking of having the procedure themselves. 
I understand cost may play a big factor in others' decision on this procedure so here are the numbers: ¬£700 paid directly to Dr. Lucy in the consultation room. For 100 units of Botox it was ¬£207 totaling ¬£907 for the whole thing. I may be wrong, but I believe the cost for 50 units is ¬£150. 

Day of procedure - Monday 4th November 2024
Procedure due at 1730. Consultation with Dr lucy who asked lots of questions about symptoms and my personal history such as alcohol consumption, diet, exercise routines etc. Diagnosed there and then with having RCPD. Dr lucy explained there isnt a clicical test for RCPD, its diagnosed symptomatically. She then explained the procedure and possible side effects. I asked for 100units however Dr lucy said there is no evidence to suggest 100 is more effective than 50. Procedure very quick! Machine to check for crichopharangeal muscle connected above collar bones. Needle inserted, and a quick sniff and swallow later, its all done. For 100 units, its a needle either side of the throat, 50units a side (however Dr Lucy missed the muscle on the second injection, resulting in a 3rd. This wasn't her fault, and was due to the right side probe coming off) Not painful at all, just feels strange, like pressure. Over in seconds.  Slight Soreness to outside of neck - like bruising. No burps but lots of throat gurgles. Went to bed fine around 10pm, no issues. 


Tuesday 5th November 2024 
Woke up 0700. Neck muscles feel very tight and sore, like I've been punched in the side of the neck. Went for breakfast in the hotel. Immediately noticed i had to swallow twice to clear food properly. 1 tiny little micro burp but not sure how I did it. Ate foods I know cause the gurgle intentionally. 2 cups of coffee. Finished breakfast. Felt bloated but not as much as normal. May have been placebo. Micro burps feel like popping candy stuck in the throat. Micro burps throughout the day at random times. Around the 24 hour post procedure mark, fizzing in throat and what felt like a trapped air bubble (I'm feeling these a little more but don't know how to release them) also a micro burp unexpectedly whilst talking. Had a big drink of Pepsi in the evening and can feel gas trying to escape while I'm drinking (again, I don't know how to release it). Had some food in the evening. Quite difficult to swallow, had to have water close by to chase down every mouthful as food seemed to be getting stuck. Went to bed and slept fine. 

Wednesday 6th November 2024
Nothing much happened when I first woke up. Got on with my day as normal. Noticed a few throat fizzes early morning. Then... at 10.15am l, after a few cups of coffee and a little to eat, I did a burp! Now, it wasn't huge and I have no idea how I pushed it out, but it worked. Few more little fizzers throughout the evening but again, very unpredictable. Really struggled with swallowing this evening. Had to chase every mouthful of food down with water. Went to bed around 11pm.

Thursday 7th November 2024
Holy cow. Slept terrible. The reason being I woke myself up burping. Coffee in the morning proved relatively uneventful. Took the kids to school and had a breakfast roll and coffee in town - incredibly diffictlult to swallow this. Few more burps throughout the morning then went to sleep ready for a night shift. Up around 4pm and had tea at 5. Slow swallow continues and more burps but still unpredictable and still not sure how to release them. Then... at around 10pm... ive cracked it! I somehow worked out that when I feel that fizz in my throat, if I put my chin on my right shoulder and just relax... THE MOST WONDERFUL, LONG, LOUD, DISGUSTING NOISE EVER IMAGINABLE is emitted. But man it feels so good. I'm writing this about an hour after eating along with about a litre of water having done approximately a thousand huge burps. No bloating, no throat gurgles, no need to lie down, no pain, no wind. It's amazing. And i know it's only going to get better. 
This, so far, truly is life changing. For some it may seem trivial - it's just a burp. But having been blighted by this for 30 years, the relief is indescribable. 

I understand this only covers a few days post procedure and many may wish to know how I've got on in the future. I'm more than happy to answer any questions on your own quest for the belch.
