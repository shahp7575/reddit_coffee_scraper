On day one I skipped coffee and had matcha instead and I wasn‚Äôt as anxious that day. Last two days I had coffee and was kind of high strung. 

Doing tasks has been easier. Today I came home from work and was hungry and found myself just cooking up some rice and beans and I didn‚Äôt have to will myself to do it.

I have a job that's alright with coworkers I love and a fiance that lives almost an hour away. In January I set the goal to be moved out by the end of the year. We're tired of living so far apart and, as much as I love them, I am ready to not live with my TBM family. I got sick a few times this summer, so that set me back a bit, but things are actually coming to fruition now. I downloaded the rental apps a few weeks ago, got a feel for what i can get in my price range, and bided my time. 

This week I heard a few rumors that a spot would be opening in a different location of the same company that is 20-30 mins from fiance. So, I let my supervisor know I was interested in relocating if a position became available. Two days later someone in that office put in their 2 weeks. It's a great opportunity and with a 10% raise I can afford to live completely on my own.

I haven't heard anything from my supervisor yet, so I don't want to get excited prematurely. However, I'm starting to second guess myself. I'm confident I would do well and look forward to more freedom, but the last time I tried moving out it didn't go to plan...

After that I was super depressed, my ex husband ended up in jail, I moved home, our marriage was annulled (due to *fraud* on his part), changed my phone number, and I've been here since. In that time I have doubled my salary and paid close to $25k in debt while also saving to move out. When I first moved back, I also went back to church full force and stayed pretty active until about 2 years ago. Home has been cordial, but tense.

I know isnt super church-y/ex-church-y and I'm hoping it doesn't get taken down. Your girl just wants to sip wine, do crafts, and get a coffee machine in relative peace.

Thoughts?

My husband and I have been married for 3 years but we have been together for almost 9 years. He comes from a blended family (so it‚Äôs his dad, stepmom and 3 sisters.) At the beginning, everything was good.. I got along with the family and quite enjoyed their company. Though I started to realize that his family would never really try to coordinate holidays with my side of the family. We were just sort of told when Christmas/Thanksgiving/Easter/Mother‚Äôs Day/Father‚Äôs Day lunches or dinners would be and would be expected to be there. For years, I attended all holidays and events that they organized and then I would pass by to see my family afterwards for coffee/dessert. My family never complained but sometimes, by the time we got there, a lot of my family members would have already left. There were times that I would spend time with his parents for fathers/mothers day rather than my own parents.¬†

Fast forward to when my husband and I (at the time boyfriend) were looking for a house together. His dad put his two cents into EVERYTHING. Told us what we need to have in the house, what we didn‚Äôt need, etc. I don‚Äôt mind the advice, but there were a lot of instances where my partner and I had decided on something, then he would talk to his dad and change his mind and THIS would cause disagreements between us.¬†

When we got engaged and were planning the wedding, his dad demanded we did this and that and everything in between. We decided to have a kid free wedding, he argued against it. We wanted the ceremony at 12, he argued against it. We decided to have a no shot wedding reception, he argued against it. We even decided against a late night station to save money, and his dad called me the week before the wedding and kept telling me I had to get a late night station for the guests! When I said that my fianc√© and I discussed it and decided against it, he called the venue behind our back to find out how much it was. He tried to say to me that my husband was telling me no, but deep down he wanted this late night station. I eventually broke down from stress and just said ok.¬†

When it came to our house, my parents helped out financially and when we asked if his parents could help, they promised us a certain amount of money. 2 days before closing, we needed that money and they told us that they couldn‚Äôt afford to give it to us. (Meanwhile, they had ripped out their kitchen and fully renovated it, redid their front and backyard.)¬†

My parents helped out financially with the wedding, and again they said they couldn‚Äôt (and then proceeded to buy new trucks, expensive furniture for their house and take trips.) Now I would have no problem if they genuinely couldn‚Äôt afford to pitch in - everyone is in a different position financially. Though, it always appeared that they had money to spend for everything else AND they could also make demands.¬†

I had asked all his sisters to be bridesmaids in my wedding, because I wanted to get close and form a bond with them. One of his sisters in particular (I‚Äôm going to call her Jen,) barely came to any bridal get-togethers, rarely responded in the group chat and acted miserable most of the time.¬†

Flash forward to after the wedding, Jen started to become very different with me. At family get-togethers she would barely speak/look at me. I would try to still make conversation with her regardless, but there were times when I asked her a question and she wouldn‚Äôt even look up off her phone. Sometimes I texted her to ask her a question and she wouldn‚Äôt respond for 24 - 48 hours. I started to feel so awkward going to events with her there. Even my husband noticed it.¬† I spoke to his other sister about it (I‚Äôm going to call her Emily) and she said she noticed it as well. My husband‚Äôs father also noticed it. Despite all this, I continued to still try with her.¬†

Fast forward a year and a half, I got pregnant. Throughout my first trimester I was so sick/nauseous. Jen got engaged. She did not ask me to be a bridesmaid. I was a little upset because I really thought I would have been in the wedding party, (my husband was asked) but obviously accepted it. The closer it came to the wedding, I really wasn‚Äôt doing well with my pregnancy sickness. The family organized a mother‚Äôs day breakfast at 8am because his step-mother had to be at work, I told them I was not going to attend because I really didn‚Äôt feel well in the mornings. I sent her a message to wish her a happy mothers day that morning though and we still took part in the gift. My husband stayed home with me to make sure I was ok. Then Father‚Äôs day came, they organized another brunch, but I had plans to be with my father. So my husband went with his father and I went with mine.¬†

I also have to add in here that Emily is a big texter. She likes to make small talk through text everyday. She will start as early as 7:30am and go until 9pm at night. If there is a natural end to the conversation, she will start it back up again. She texted me every single day during my pregnancy asking me how I was feeling. At first I thought it was nice of her to think of me, but then it became overwhelming.¬† I am not a big texter, but I would just go with it because I knew she was being nice, but being nauseous and tired, I really just wanted to rest. Eventually, I did tell her twice, very subtly and politely that being on my phone was making me nauseous and I wasn‚Äôt a big fan of texting. She did not ease up on the texting. At one point my husband asked her to pull back a bit with the texting because I was getting overwhelmed, she still didn‚Äôt stop. She would also ask me every week to get together for coffee/walks and I would repeatedly say to her that I wasn‚Äôt up for it being so sick. She would ask me every day ‚Äúare you feeling better today?‚Äù until I would just push myself and get together with her so I could then be left alone. (Of course this cycle repeated every new week.)¬†

For Jen‚Äôs wedding, I stayed home from the rehearsal as I was still super sick. My husband, who was in the wedding, went to the rehearsal but then didn‚Äôt stay for he dinner; he came home to make sure I was ok. Come the wedding day 2 days later, I attended the ceremony and the reception alone (because again, my husband was in the wedding). I was not only dealing with pregnancy sickness but I also had a cold. I still attended and stayed until after midnight and had a good time. When I got to the reception, my husband was so angry because he told me that they had organized family photos and no-one had told me to be there early to take part in it. The family photos were taken and I was not included. My husband also told me that they were going to announce ‚Äúa special dance‚Äù after the couples first dance and tell everyone to ‚Äúgrab their someone special.‚Äù They told my husband that he was to go and grab his step-mother and to not tell me about it. I do not know why but I am glad my husband did tell me in advance so I wasn‚Äôt blind sided by this. The following morning, they did a dinner because it was nearing Jen‚Äôs birthday. I did not attend because I was throwing up and had a migraine, but I texted her wishing her a wonderful day and I was sorry I couldn‚Äôt make it.¬†

For our pregnancy, we decided to do a gender reveal party. We picked a date and told everyone about¬† it. My family was good to attend, his family told us that that date date wouldn‚Äôt work for them and that a different date would be better. So we rescheduled it. Then again, the new date was not good for them, so we rescheduled again‚Ä¶..and again. We had to reschedule our gender reveal party 3 times to accommodate them and which then meant that MY sister couldn‚Äôt attend. We planned it for 7pm. Emily texted us at 7pm when we were waiting for her and had told us she were going to be late and hadn‚Äôt even left the house yet.¬†

We got invited to Jen‚Äôs sister-in laws wedding. We were to RSVP online. I completely forgot about rsvping and the day after we were due to respond, Jen sent my husband and I a message saying ‚ÄúWedding planning is stressful and we should not put any other unnecessary stress on the bride. The answer is yes or no, advise her now or respond to the wedding invite online.‚Äù At this point I had reached my limit. I sent Jen a message privately telling her that her message was unnecessarily rude and that she could have reminded us in a nicer way. I also said it seems that she had some sort of issue with me and I don‚Äôt know what I did. I told her that other people in the family noticed it and that she should tell me what I did because I was not going to feel uncomfortable and stressed out anymore while I was pregnant. 2 days later I got a 2 page text from her saying, giving me a timeline dating back 3 years of ‚Äúeverything I‚Äôve ever done wrong,‚Äù saying I was entitled, disrespectful and I ‚Äúcame and went as I pleased‚Äù because I had missed a few events due to being sick while pregnant. I had shown disrespect to every single member of the family. She told me that I was ‚Äúacting like a victim in a problem that I created.‚Äù There was no mention of the fact that the reason why I didn‚Äôt attend these few events was due to being pregnant and sick. There was no acknowledgement that for 8 years, we put my husband‚Äôs family first for all holidays and mine just got whatever time we had left over.¬†

Some more background information to note: my husbands father, as I said was very invasive in our relationship. Whenever we made a decision, he‚Äôd call my husband and try to make him change his mind or tell him that we should be doing something else. Some of our mail was still being sent to his house and he would open it and look through it (after being asked not to.) For weddings, he would call my husband up and ask how much money we were putting in the card - if he didn‚Äôt like what we decided on, he‚Äôd try to get him to put more. For our wedding, my husband had a stag and at the end of the night, my FIL took it upon himself to pay the venue girls a large amount of money, without discussing it with my husband.¬†

I got quite close to his sister Emily and would confide in her in a lot of personal things. When Jen sent me the 2 page text, a lot of the things I confided in Emily in were written in that text and were twisted to make me look bad. I came to realize that maybe I couldn‚Äôt trust Emily like I thought I could.¬†

I would ask the family to come to me with any important information instead of telling my husband because he always forgot and I wouldn‚Äôt get the info. I had been asking them to do this for years. They completely disregarded this and I would continue to find things out last minute, then they would blame me for ‚Äúnot communicating properly.‚Äù Emily would coordinate family gifts without asking us if we felt comfortable putting in certain amount¬† of money - she would just tell us the amount we owed for the gift. I told my husband that we would do our own gifts from now on to which he agreed. When he told Emily this, she was upset and asked him ‚Äúwhy are you pulling away from the family?‚Äù¬†

Going back to the note from Jen, after receiving it, I didn‚Äôt respond because I felt I needed to remain stress free for the remainder of my pregnancy. So I left it alone. Emily pretended it never happened and when I asked to talk to her about it, she basically told me she agreed with everything that was written in the note. I reminded her that the things I was being blamed for (not attending events) weren‚Äôt being done to be rude or disrespectful, but because I was dealing with pregnancy sickness. She disregarded that. ¬†

I struggled for a few weeks trying to comprehend being blamed for so much and being made out to be a problem in the family, when all I was trying to do was make it through a horrible first trimester.¬†

A few months later, I was having my baby shower, Jen did not attend nor did she send a gift or a card. Then she announced that she was pregnant, I sent her a congratulations text.¬†

Come this past thanksgiving, my husband and I decided that for once, we would attend the thanksgiving meal with my family and then pass by his family after. (Note, I am currently 8 1/2 months pregnant at this stage.) We had dinner with my family and then left to go to his family. The other siblings were leaving, I said hi to Emily and I said hi to Jen (despite there being tension) to which she completely ignored and turned away from me. I shook it off, and we went into the house to visit with his parents. When we decided to go home, his parents said they want to talk to us. I figured it wold be about the tension with Jen. They then proceeded to rip into me for an hour and a half, saying I owed their daughter an apology.. how I was rude to not come to certain events, etc. I said, ‚Äúbut I didn‚Äôt come because I was sick.‚Äù To which my MIL said ‚ÄúI was pregnant once too.‚Äù I was crying the whole time and my MIL said she didn‚Äôt understand why I was so upset. I asked them if they saw the 2 page note Jen sent me after I had asked her to let me know what I had done to her, and they said yes they read it, but it was written out of ‚Äúemotion.‚Äù Whereas my text to her, letting her know that her initial message to us was not very nice, was ‚Äúhurtful.‚Äù (I will also note that my husband got very angry with his parents and was defending me the entire time.) I also have to mention here that after Emily and my father in law had both previously stated they saw how Jen acted towards me and noticed the tension - they now both said they never thought she had a problem with me, making me believe I imagine it.¬†

After an hour and a half of this, I said to my husband that I wanted to go. They tried to ‚Äúcomfort‚Äù me by saying they ‚Äúcared about me.‚Äù They then proceeded to ask me ‚Äúso do you want us to come to the hospital when you have the baby?‚Äù  
When we got home, I was so upset and my husband said it was time to take a break from his family. I told him that I love him but If it wasn‚Äôt for the baby, I would have to walk away from the marriage because I can‚Äôt deal with how invasive his family is. As of now, I am due in 2 - 3 weeks, and I have blocked his entire family. I have felt a lot more at peace and like I can breathe. His family has cause me immense stress this entire pregnancy and I just can‚Äôt take it anymore. I told my husband I want nothing to do with them for a while, and he understands. I do not know what to do when our baby is born because I know they will demand that they see their grandchild.¬†

Am I crazy/delusional or are they toxic and gaslighting me into thinking I‚Äôm the problem??  
(PS. There are a lot of other horrible things that they have done that I haven‚Äôt mentioned, but I promise I have not left anything out that I have done that would cause them to feel a certain way about me. I have always done everything they wanted, attended all events/holidays,(except the few when I was sick) participated in gifts, etc.)¬†

1g6x3n5,https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/comments/1g6x3n5/gf_f23_is_angry_that_i_m26_hanged_out_alone_with/,"Gf [F23] is angry that I [M26] hanged out alone with a female friend [F23], am I the bad guy? ","Hi folks, long time lurker and first time poster. My gf and I have been in a relationship for years now. While we have had our ups and downs, I‚Äôm totally dedicated and loyal to her and want to marry her sometime soon in the future, as soon as she is done with her higher education. I genuinely love her and see a future with her.

My female friend Sarah and I have been friends for the past couple of years, honestly as long as I‚Äôve been dating my gf. Her family and my family are friends as well, and I have always looked out for Sarah‚Äôs younger brother and mentored him, as their father passed away due to cancer. Whether it‚Äôs providing career advice, writing letters of recommendation, job referrals, or even financially assisting the family at rare times, I‚Äôve always casually looked out for Sarah and her family when I am able to. I was raised by a single mother and know personally how hard it can be. My gf is aware of me helping out this family in the past, and has met Sarah a couple of times but is by no means close to her in any way. 

Recently my gf went on a week long trip to Atlanta for work. During this time Sarah got into a car wreck. Luckily she wasn‚Äôt injured. We decided to hang out on the weekend and grab some coffee or boba and catch up, talk about some of the issues her family and her were facing recently, and see if I could do anything to help them out. We have hanged out in the past before but always in a group setting. 

On the day Sarah and I were going to hang out, I texted my gf about me having plans to hang out with Sarah. She asked if it was just going to be her, and I responded with ‚ÄúRight now yes, but her siblings might join like they‚Äôve done in the past tbh.‚Äù I then asked ‚ÄúIs that fine with you‚Äù to which she responded ‚ÄúDo whatever you want.‚Äù 

Uh oh. I knew she was troubled if she said that. I immediately said ‚ÄúIf this makes you uncomfortable I can cancel right now‚Äù, as well as ‚ÄúI just want to be transparent with you‚Äù. She kept responding with ‚ÄúNo‚Äù and stonewalling me, saying she was fine. Eventually I just took her word for it, picked up Sarah, and we went to a cafe I enjoy 30 minutes away in a nearby city, where I paid for the coffee and we chatted. I updated my gf when I arrived at the coffee shop, telling her the name of the coffee shop (she never responded). After our conversation I updated my gf that I‚Äôm heading back to drop Sarah off, and I then proceeded to take Sarah home. I then texted my gf that I was going to go hang out with another male friend of mine and then went on with my day. 

My gf has come back from her trip to Atlanta and is now extremely upset at me for hanging out with Sarah. She is saying that I went on a date with Sarah and cheated on her. Her main argument is that I didn‚Äôt tell her that Sarah‚Äôs siblings didn‚Äôt come along when I picked her up so it was just us alone, that I picked her up and dropped her off, paid for her coffee, and went to a nearby different city but didn‚Äôt specifically mention I was going to a nearby city. Furthermore, my location via Snapchat was not on, but this is due to me having a week ago bought a new phone and I didn‚Äôt set up my location via Snapchat yet. 

After thinking about it, I can see her point of view. It does look bad. If that happened in reverse to me, where a man picked up my gf, took her out to coffee, paid for her drink, and my gf‚Äôs location was off, it would seem suspicious and I would be upset as well. It‚Äôs the perfect storm.  

I picked up Sarah and dropped her off since her car was totaled, and paid for the coffee since she‚Äôs going through financial hardship right now. I was just genuinely just trying to be a good guy and help out a friend, and have no romantic feelings whatsoever towards Sarah. I do however feel that my gf is going to far of accusing me of being a cheater and saying I went out on a date with Sarah. We were just hanging out and seeing if I can help her and her family out. Being accused as a cheater and her repeatedly saying I went on a date with her is causing me emotional pain and anxiety. I don‚Äôt think a cheater would announce he is going to hang out with a girl, provide some level of updates, and even say he can cancel the hangout if she‚Äôs uncomfortable with it. I even tried to give her a chance to communicate with me even before the hangout, which she refused to do so. 

I‚Äôm not excusing myself however. I could‚Äôve communicated more clearly, let my gf know of the city I went to instead of just the cafe name, provided more updates throughout the time I was hanging out, and made it clear it was just me and Sarah. For these mistakes I do sincerely feel bad and own up to them, and have  apologized to my gf. I‚Äôm not trying to discredit her feelings, they are valid. But I‚Äôm still continuously hurt but what my gf is saying about me being a cheater and going in a date with another woman. I would never in a million years cheat on my gf, yet here she is accusing me of this.

We have taken some time apart to cool down and think. Am I being unreasonable here in saying that I‚Äôm not a cheater and did not go on a date with Sarah? Or are my gf‚Äôs accusations too much?

Any guidance, advice, or feedback are appreciated. I will own up to any mistakes I have made. ",2,1729298392.0,amiwrong,0,1.0,False

My dad (70 years old) informed me earlier that he has spent all of his pension and he only has ¬£30k in a savings account, which he reckons will be gone within 2 years. Then he'll only have the state pension as his only form of income.

I literally can not comprehend how financially irresponsible he has been. He's always had the attitude of he won't be able to take the money with him when he's dead, plus he sees it as it's his money that he's worked hard for so he'll spend it as he sees fit. Well, he's spent it.

He hasn't even got anything to show for it. He retired at 55. Not because he had a load of money, but because he just didn't want to work any more. I think he had around ¬£350k in his retirement pot when he retired in 2008. My parents got divorced 2014 and his pension pot got halved. He took out loans to pay the legal fees and he was ordered to pay most of my mum's legal fees. 

After the divorce, he refused to live in a cheap 1 bed place, so he took out a buy to let interest only mortgage of ¬£120k to top up his savings to buy a 2 bed bungalow. The bank found out after a few years that he was living in the BTL property so they gave him an ultimatum to pay up or get evicted. He ended up selling the bungalow to some equity release company who gave him ¬£150k for the property. It was worth double that. He's able to live in it until he dies. He paid off the mortgage he had and put the rest into savings.

He used to be a hardcore smoker and, at his worst, was spending ¬£1k a month on cigarettes (smoking 100 fags a day). He's basically been doing this forever. He quit last year, partly because he had a health scare (he's fine) and partly because he ran out of money.

He goes to a cafe most days and will spend a tenner on coffee and lunch. Probably averages out to ¬£200-¬£250 a month on this alone.

Not to mention his bungalow is in an absolutely terrible state. Every single surface has layers upon layers of browny yellow tar/nicotine stains. The carpets are all worn, the kitchen cabinets are all falling apart, his toilet leaks and always has a puddle of water around the floor, plus the bathroom is 40 years old and the tiles are coming away from the wall. The whole place needs gutting and then totally decorated, but he has no money to do any of the work that needs to be done.

I don't have any money to help because I've got my own mortgage and bills to pay. Plus, even if I did, I resent how utterly terrible he's been with his money I probably wouldn't help anyway.

I‚Äôm a junior in high school, and there this senior girl in my AP physics class. She is also taking the same calculus class as me but during a different hour.
I think she is very intelligent and interesting and we‚Äôre definitely friends. I got her number roughly a month ago, before our fall break.
When we do text, which we do usually around a couple times a week or more, the conversation lasts around an hour or two. It‚Äôs almost always me initiating the conversation, but she always replies immediately, so I think she just doesn‚Äôt think about me much on her own hahaha. She‚Äôs very friendly to me and smiles and waves before she sits down next to me. She does initiate conversations equally in person. We talk during (my teacher doesn‚Äôt like that so much) and after class and she walks me to my next one.

We both are currently struggling in physics, so I asked her if she wanted to study with me. She said yes immediately and suggested a coffee shop, and said she‚Äôs free tomorrow. So we‚Äôre going tomorrow. I‚Äôm really excited and she‚Äôs really cute. It‚Äôs not a date, I know that for sure, but it‚Äôs something. This is going to be my first time seeing her outside of school.

I‚Äôve just never attempted to pursue a crush, but I feel like this might work out if I do things right. My questions are: How do I let her know that I‚Äôm interested in her? When do I let her know? How do I do that without making her uncomfortable if she doesn‚Äôt feel the same?

I want to make it clear that I would be disappointed if she rejected me, but I would be happy to stay friends with her. 

I‚Äôve liked her from the start, as soon as I met her. Usually it takes me several months to find someone attractive. I have no indication that she‚Äôs also interested in me, but I also have no indication that she isn‚Äôt. This is new to me",1,1729298302.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke. It was our song remastered",1,1729298109.0,Tik_tok_stories,0,1.0,False

Not to mention my little camp stove. 

When I went in to donate plasma this morning my weight has actually gone up 5 lb in the last month. I go in at the same time of the week twice a week, my eating habits have become routine, so I know it's not anything to do with how much food I have in me it's an actual measurable weight gain.

Every Tuesday and Friday morning I go in and get my blood money lol. After that my routine is the same I go out get a pack of smokes, head to the McDonald's and get whatever deals I can afford for right around five or six dollars. It's usually early morning, mainly because I'm not supposed to smoke before donating because of blood pressure reasons, so I get a breakfast sandwich, sausage egg and cheese McGriddle is my favorite with a hash brown and a hot coffee. And because I'm a little bit lazy when I have that tiny bit of extra money I eat McDonald's for my next meal too. Today I even had a caramel frappe oh man it's been so long since I could afford one of those, so fucking good, oh my God, anyways.

Like usual just wanted to share this little bit of joy with anyone else out there who's struggling, hoping all of you can find something to bring you a little bit of Joy too. You are My people and I love you.

I have been doing little physical exercise as I have been working 70 hour weeks and have been scared of burning out (happened a lot in the past with workload and excersize)
The physical changes are great, but the reason for this post is the affects it has had on my life. 

I have been ridden with anxiety the last 15 years, it's been a nightmare, the last 5 of which have been making me avoid living a normal life. Always had depression but about 5 years ago it really hit rock bottom. I spent the past 6 years running my business and pushing through everything. No time or energy for hobbies, ditching on plans due to panic attacks and inability to cope in social situations. 

I previously did keto for 2 years and it was great, but the anxiety and depression were still fairly bad. 

In the past 4 weeks I have not only been able to keep up with the stresses of running my incredibly busy business, but I have stopped napping daily, having panic attacks, I have found old passions and hobbies and actively partaking in them again. I'm sleeping better, actually feel proud of achievements I'm hitting where as before it all felt hollow. 

For anyone considering doing this with mental health issues, please stick with it for a good bit. We are all different and this isnt for everyone, but I have never felt so good in my life.

Nice little side note, the big push for me to do this was to bring my blood pressure down. It's come from an average of 165/95 - 143/84.

All was well until she was basically screwing him over for drop off back to her trying to push it for another night while dash had to work very early the next morning. She decided to say that if he left my house with mino she would call the police for abuse because it‚Äôs cold out (she didn‚Äôt pack him anything warm) or abandonment.

1g6wvit,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1g6wvit/trouble_coping/,Trouble coping,"My partner and I have had a really bizarre and rough 5 years. I won't go into all the details, but I will focus on what is going on now. My partner had post partum depression from the birth of our daughter (now 5), until our son turned 1 ( now 2 and a half). This lasted about 3 years. While I am sympathetic to this and what she went, I wish I could have helped, plus there is a big safety issue for her and the children. I just kept telling myself she was tired and when the kids started sleeping the night she would come back to reality.
My partner works a rotating shift at a hospital. Due to the time she leaves and returns from work she doesn't see the kids and I am essentially a single parent those days.
About a year ago when she had gone back to work after maternity leave for about 6 months I came to her asking if she could look for work closer to home. I let her know myself and the kids were struggling with her absence. She accused me of attacking her choosen profession. This lead to 5 major fights over the last year. 
Around April I laid out all the issues I was having with our relationship and that things needed to change. I decision to stop relying on her for anything. 
My partner is not very technically inclined. In May she was having problems with her phone and storage and asked me to help. When checking the storage I found 250 plus notes. I started going through them to see if a bunch could be cleared. I found a note written the night I laid out all the issues. This note was 2 paragraph long and detailed what a verbally abusive alcoholic I am. I was shocked. I did a quick key word search on the phone and found she had copied and sent that note to 10 different people on different dates over the month up until the day before. I decided to not mention it and stick to my plan. 
Around my birthday in July, she had an opportunity to go on a girl's trip on my actual birthday. She hadn't been on a trip like this since pre kids. I encouraged her to go. She felt bad about missing my birthday. I said as a gift to arrange a date where someone else could take the kids and we could have 5-6 hours of time just two of us to relax and be intimate which she agreed to. 
Two weeks after my birthday nothing had happened plan. She brought up being scared of that day because she thought I meant 5 hours of straight sex. I reassured her that was not what I meant and that I would not be able to perform for that long. 
A month has passed since the birthday and this had not happened. I had also noticed a trend of her declining intimacy on a weekly basis. She declined intimacy and could tell something was bothering me so she pressed the issue. So I let her know the trend I was seeing and that we had not done the birthday plan. She accused me of only caring about sex. I let her know that was not the case and that I did not feel cared about, wanted or attractive to her. She proceeded to fight me for the next hour in front of our children to the point our daughter had to ask us to stop fighting and for her to specifically stop yelling at dad. She eventually came to the conclusion we were speaking a different love language.
Two nights later she went on a girl's night. They went to see the movie it ends with us. She had gotten a new phone that I had set up for her. I asked her if she wanted the old phone wiped so she could trade in or sell. She declined wanting to keep it as a back up. The phone would turn itself on randomly I'm guessing due to the age of the phone. It would start receiving active notifications. It was very annoying and I would have to turn the phone off again. That night she started receiving im's from another guy. I understand looking is an invasion of privacy, but I had to look. It was one of the last guys she dated before me. She had initiated the conversation. I decided to keep the phone with me at this point. 
The following Monday she put there conversation into vanish mode which sent me spiralling. I took the day off work. Whole putting the kids to bed I had 2 beers. She turned off vanish mode stating she lost whatever had been written because she didn't understand how to use it. I fell asleep with our son on my chest. She got home from work and accused me of being drunk in front of the kids.
The next night she went to her friend's house after work. I requested couples counseling at this point. She agreed via text. At this point based on what I was seeing and what she was saying I believed she was being coached by the group of friends, multiple of who had recently or currently been going through a divorce.
The next day she sent an IM to the guy again detailing that I am a verbally abusive alcoholic and suggesting they go for a coffee and hang out. She compared herself as the main character from it ends with us and stating that movie really put things into perspective. He brushed her off claiming busy schedule. 
I'm not sure if it was getting brushed off that, but she came home changed. She apologized for how she had been acting, stated she wanted to work on us. She also admitted to a spending addiction at this point. I agreed to that. I wasn't sure if I could get over her attempting to reach out to another guy. She didn't know I knew this part yet. I rationalized it by telling myself she hadn't done anything physical with the person. 
Two weeks went by and things seemed okay. Then she started IM the guy again. Suggesting multiple dates they should go catch up. I did not know what to do at this point. 
One of the things she had told me was that her family did not want to come to our house or be around me because of me being verbally abusive to her. We ran into a situation where we were both stuck at work and had no one to pick up our kids. I had to call her mom for help which she was more than glad to do. 
I came home first. I decided to apologize to her mom. I took responsibility for the comments I had made over that year and was deeply ashamed of them. I let her know that these comments were made during fights where I was advocating for myself or our children, this is all true. Her mom let me know that she was not coming around because she didn't believe her daughter. They knew me and the story they were being told did not add up. Knowing the story she apologized to me for what her daughter had put me through and did not want me to leave. She suggested I speak to her sister. Same conversation with the same result. At this point I decided to confront her and I did that night. 
She backpedaled and apologized like crazy. Since the confrontation she has agreed to counseling and has been sucking up. 
I let her know I am trying but I am struggling. I feel betrayed and slandered by the person who is supposed to love me. I let her know I need answers to the note and why she sent it to so many people. I let her know it seemed like she would call me those things to anyone who would listen. She claims she has updated those people verbally. I also let her know I need an answer on why she would reach out to another guy, disclose those things and suggest a meet up. To me it seems like she was attempting to hook up with him by making herself out to be the victim. She claims he had been a good support in the past, pre me, and that she was looking for advice, which I have a hard time believing. 
I am struggling. There is a lot more to this story, including emotional abuse and manipulation, eating disorder, and other things done by both of us. But this story is already seeming long enough. I feel betrayed, and that my trust is broken. I still love her and am trying to make this work for my kids. She has seemed genuine, but I still feel like I'm being lied to. We are about to start therapy and I had a few questions I'm hoping for some help on.
1. She attempted to meet up with another person, but I called her out on it and stopped it before it could happen. I've found a bunch of resources about actual cheating, but nothing about failed attempts to. Is there a term for this or any resources on something like this?
2. Aside from monitoring everything she does how do I trust her again? ",1,1729297688.0,therapy,0,1.0,False

This is right before the shit hits the fan yet again with the kid-on-motorbike murder and all of the killings in jail simultaneously etc. later on.

Twice, Walt does a really effective job of manipulating his extended family members.

One is when he weaponizes his knowledge of Skyler's affair with dimbulb Ted. This is after Skyler does her sinking to the bottom of the pool thing. Walt is potentially in deep shit here but handles it beautifully.

Walt throws Marie and Hank off the scent by revealing to Marie that Skyler banged Ted, chalking up Skyler's semi-not-really suicide attempt to her being despondent over Ted's ""household accident"" and paralysis or whatever.

The second is when Walt needs to bug the DEA office. Walt comes in with a (literal) Skyler sob story about how ""She says that I'm a bad influence on the kids. And ah, I'm not good for them. She thinks I'm a bad father."" Of course all of this throws Hank for a loop and he goes to get Walt a coffee, allowing Walt to bug the office.

***Monday*** 

It was after dark by the time Alfie Rincon and his pet hedgehog made it back to the automotive spray painting warehouse that they were using for their base of operations. There were more people on site than there had been when he left, and they all looked exceedingly ‚Ä¶. leg-breaker-ish.

He swallowed and moved through the thugs to the small apartment at the back that he‚Äôd shared with three other men for almost the last month. ‚ÄúWell?‚Äù Cody Singer demanded as he crushed out a cigarette the second he entered the room.

Alfie tightened his grip on Spike (who was still napping happily in his beanie home), willing himself to report even though the words burned like acid on the back of his throat.

*I‚Äôm sorry, Doctor Williams‚Ä¶* ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt go after his boss, Doctor Khai.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not a nameless nobody. He‚Äôs the older brother of the owner, Skylar Hart, and he‚Äôs a US military doctor on loan. If he and his pregnant wife were to suddenly disappear, people with access to much bigger weapons and the wherewithal to use them are going to start poking into our employer‚Äôs business. Especially if the good doctor and his wife turn up later, murdered.‚Äù

Cody swore and kicked the nearest thing to him, which happened to be the coffee table. It skated through the sea of empty pizza boxes and bounced off the far wall on the other side near the cots.

Alfie‚Äôs breath caught at the angry display, for Cody was usually the calm one of their group. The complication of enemy firepower for the sake of an information source clearly wasn‚Äôt sitting well with the man. With that realisation, Alfie suddenly thought of something that could potentially save Dr Williams. ‚ÄúWilliams now has private security too,‚Äù he said, trying to make it sound off-handed instead of the Hail Mary he saw it as.

Cody swung around to face him. ‚ÄúFucking ‚Ä¶ *what?!‚Äù*

*Yes!* Swallowing not only to hide his glee but also his fear of having to face Cody alone like this, he added, ‚ÄúHe says it‚Äôs courtesy of a rich friend who doesn‚Äôt want him riding the subway alone at night. I‚Äôm guessing Wilcott‚Äôs the one behind it since he‚Äôs the marker that‚Äôs fallen ass-over-tit into money, but the whole time I was there, the bruiser was too, and he really creeped me out ‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because you‚Äôre a black hat. Everybody with a third dimension to them creeps you out,‚Äù Jamie, another of their team, quipped from over on the computer wall.

Alfie was tempted to flip the guy off, except he was right. Like most dark web hackers, he had terrible people skills. ‚ÄúI think the guy was armed, and if Khai‚Äôs military as well, chances are he is too. That‚Äôs two armed men with Williams at all times. If anyone tries to grab Doctor Williams from work, it won‚Äôt be a matter of walking in there, brandishing a gun, and walking out with him. There‚Äôs going to be a huge scene.‚Äù

‚ÄúKhai might not be armed,‚Äù Jamie called out, this time turning to face them. ‚ÄúThe military doesn‚Äôt like it when their soldier boys go armed while native.‚Äù

*Shut up, dude!* ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs still military, with all their training. Not some country bumpkin that got roped in to help his sister. If we go in guns blazing, he won't freeze and do as he's told.‚Äù

Cody turned towards Alfie with his hands fisted against his hips. ‚ÄúWhat exactly did Williams tell you?‚Äù

Alfie brightened. ‚ÄúHe said Spike‚Äôs gonna be‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI meant about the bodyguard, idiot! I don‚Äôt give a flying fuck about your damn walking pincushion. Is the guard always with him, or are there times when he‚Äôs not? We need something to tell our employers!‚Äù

Alfie flinched like he‚Äôd been struck. He‚Äôd been working with these guys for a while now, and once his boss was pushed too far, the guy was just as likely to stab Spike with a steak knife for being in the way. The man was cool as a cucumber most of the time but had all the empathy of a wrecking ball once that patience ran its course.

*I‚Äôm really sorry, Dr Williams.* ‚ÄúH-He said the bodyguard sits in the reception when he‚Äôs not needed by whoever he actually works for.‚Äù

And with that revelation, Cody relaxed and smiled an unfriendly smile. ‚ÄúGood. So, there *are* windows to be exploited. Assuming that his newly minted ‚Äòrich friend‚Äô *is* Wilcott, we already have his schedule, so finding and exploiting that window should be child's play.‚Äù

‚ÄúPayday, here we come!‚Äù Clay Moss‚Äîthe fourth and final member of their team‚Äîcackled.

Alfie cuddled Spike close and said nothing. *I‚Äôm sorry, Dr Williams.*

‚ÄúGood thing all the bad shit hangs off Wilcott,‚Äù Jamie said, typing furiously into his computer. The itinerary of Trevino‚Äôs youngest marker appeared on the large wall screen. ‚ÄúBetween someone bankrolling him, this unknown torturer paying too much attention to him, *and* the fact that he goes to the only school in this stinking city that‚Äôs located behind a set of US Navy boom gates,‚Äù the hacker shook his head. ‚ÄúIf our choices are between grabbing that guy and the one that only has one off-duty military guy in another room‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter,‚Äù Cody said, moving back towards the computers to read the screen. ‚ÄúIf what Alfie said is true and the driver stays with Wilcott until Williams is dropped off and picked up from school ‚Ä¶ bring up a street map of New York City.‚Äù

Clay typed, and a detailed map replaced the list.

‚ÄúHighlight the vet clinic and the school Wilcott goes to.‚Äù

Two bright red dots appeared on the image.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I thought. We don‚Äôt know who gets dropped off first in the mornings, but the Wilcott kid finishes school at three, and Williams works until after five. That‚Äôs at least an hour or two round trip in the afternoon. If our employer gets their people into position by two and wait for him to leave, that‚Äôs their window.‚Äù

*God, I‚Äôm so sorry, Dr Williams.*

\* \* \*

‚ÄúIf I were to ask what everyone knows about this brand Sam has, would any of you answer me?‚Äù Mom asked of the whole table once we‚Äôd all sat down to eat. I now understood all the extra chairs that I broke my neck on yesterday in my dressing room, as our number had grown to seat Tiacor, Larry, *and* my guys. That left fourteen different people she could question, including six full divine and two hybrids.

The true gryps glanced at each other, and even I could tell they were talking amongst themselves. That didn‚Äôt bode well for them because if I could see it, Mom would be all over it.

‚ÄúEither speak out loud or leave the table and converse somewhere else,‚Äù she said, using her fork like a pointer that moved from one to the next until she‚Äôd encompassed all five of them, including Tiacor. ‚ÄúYou will not do the equivalent of speaking behind your raised hand at this table. It‚Äôs rude.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù Larry said on behalf of them all. ‚ÄúSince you want to know, we were actually discussing your lack of faith and trust in your son and his father.‚Äù

*Ooooh, crap,* I thought, straightening in my seat. Over Mom‚Äôs head, I saw Dad do likewise.

‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù Mom growled, her invisible hackles rising to the challenge.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pregnant with three divine hybrids, Miss W,‚Äù Kulon added, cutting off the older true gryps. ‚ÄúWhat possible reason could they have for keeping a situation that might compromise your pregnancy from you?‚Äù

His mockery was clear, and the way Mom folded her arms, I knew this would go from bad to worse in a matter of seconds. It was like watching a tornado starting to form. ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm very aware of how much they don‚Äôt want me to worry about anything, but nobody gets to decide that for me except me.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot if it doesn‚Äôt pertain to you,‚Äù Tiacor answered. ‚ÄúIf those men wish to keep something between themselves that has no bearing on you, you have no grounds to demand that information from them. It‚Äôs between them. So, our original discussion still stands. You either trust the men in your life, or you don‚Äôt.‚Äù

Dad and I looked at each other before he gave me a very discreet head shake, warning me not to wade in.

I thought that was weird, given the huge deal he‚Äôd always made over the importance of making our stand. *Why is he letting the true gryps fight for him?*

And then I looked at it through different eyes. The kind that was used to overseeing everything from on high, like a chess master ‚Ä¶ or the eldest son of a living War Goddess. If a rook wanted to intercept a queen and it was for the king‚Äôs benefit; let him.

That, and it also kept Mom from yelling at *us.*

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not an issue of trust. I know my boys, and I know exactly how far they‚Äôll go to protect me from something, even if that mindset is ridiculously flawed. They‚Äôll break their own legs to prevent me from suffering so much as a splinter. For goodness sake, I watched Llyr go through thrall withdrawal just to teach Sam the pain involved with that. So if that means I have to be proactive against their idealised stupidity, I will be.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd maybe we can heal from a broken leg even quicker than you can heal from a splinter, Mom,‚Äù I said, entering the fray anyway. Because stuff it. If she wanted to make a stand, then dammit, she would know what she was really up against. Dad and I weren‚Äôt human, with Dad having no human DNA at all. The man didn‚Äôt even have a soul to speak of. He had *power.* Divinity. The differences between him and Mom were like ice water and boiling water, with me in the middle having a nice warm bath with dips into the extreme temperatures every now and again.

‚ÄúWe can,‚Äù Dad agreed. ‚ÄúA broken bone is repaired in a matter of hours. A splinter will continue to mar your skin for days.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo not the point I‚Äôm making here.‚Äù

‚ÄúHowever, it *is* the point everyone else is making, Ivy,‚Äù Dad insisted, stunning the hell out of me. I couldn‚Äôt remember the last time Dad called her by her real name. ‚ÄúEven the worst possible thing imaginable is merely a few days of excruciating pain before it is over for me. My powerbase is set, and nothing is going to happen to it. I will stand between you and everything else right now because unlike you, I *will* survive it. Likewise, Sam has a better chance of surviving it than you because he shares my divine bloodline.‚Äù

Dad brushed the back of his knuckles against her cheek, following her when she pulled away from him and towards me as if she didn‚Äôt want to be touched until the contact was made. ‚ÄúYou have only one job right now, babe. Just one. Live for those three babies. Let Sam and me handle everything else.‚Äù

Mom‚Äôs lips pinched and she glared at Dad vexedly as he spread his fingers to cup her cheek, but the biggest shock was that she didn‚Äôt lose her mind at him.  The Mom I knew would‚Äôve turned violent by now.

I tried to school my expression, knowing I wouldn‚Äôt change my mind about the brand no matter what she found out.

I would endure a hundred cigarette burns to keep her from being taken from me‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶and that‚Äôs all there was to it.

","I had the duo switch. And it was a hard fought battle but I gave up starbucks a week before my surgery. I used to get a Trenta iced coffee every single day for years. 

Anyway, I‚Äôve been having a terrible time post op with liquids. My stomach hates water, it always feels like it‚Äôs ‚Äúdropping‚Äù and then my stomach hurts for about 5 seconds after. I‚Äôve tried all temps of it. Then I tried Gatorade can‚Äôt stand the artificial tastes. I‚Äôve always hated every crystal light, but one. So I‚Äôve tried that for a few days but it was a chore to drink. I hadn‚Äôt been able to get in more than 15 oz since my surgery in a single day. 

So I thought what about unsweetened tea. So I went to sonic and got one. I was like no calories no sweeteners, I‚Äôm good. And I was able to get in 32 oz in one day! I was so excited to finally hit my personal liquid goal. So I got one the next day. Same thing happens. And then I looked it up and it has about 200 mg caffeine for what I‚Äôm drinking?!! I‚Äôm devastated. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

I purchased a **Zotac RTX 4080 16GB AMP Extreme Airo** from an authorized shop in BD on August 6, 2023. Living in a poor third-world country, buying this GPU wasn‚Äôt easy; it cost me **a fortune of $1,572.** Just over a year after buying it, on **October 3, 2024**, I experienced something extremely shocking.

I was simply watching a YouTube video with 5-6 Chrome tabs open when I suddenly heard a ""frrr, frrr, frrr"" noise. When I looked at my PC, to my shock, I saw **actual flames** inside my PC case!

Thankfully, my main power cord was right next to my desk, and I immediately disconnected it. At first, I thought the fire was coming from the PSU (**MSI MPG A1000G PCIE5 1000W 80+ Gold**). But when I took a closer look, I found a large soot mark on the glass door of my **Thermaltake View 51 TG case**. I opened the case and discovered that around **1 cm** of the **GPU‚Äôs circuit board** at the edge was severely burnt.

https://preview.redd.it/y3u0w7euslvd1.jpg?width=8000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81fba14abe0790d90dfce7174020972c0c7b6411

I‚Äôve always treated this GPU with great care: **no overclocking, no tweaking, no gaming.** It was primarily used for **light video editing** (FB reels for clients), where the GPU faced minimal pressure. However, I had plans to use this GPU for more graphics-intensive tasks in the future, especially once I had the chance to learn software like Autodesk Maya.

Additionally, my apartment is equipped with an **over-voltage circuit breaker** that trips if the voltage goes above 250V. The weather was completely normal at the time, and I have a **dedicated grounding line** specifically for my PC and its peripherals.¬†

[The over-voltage circuit breaker usually displays 10-15V more. Right now, it‚Äôs showing 243V, but the actual voltage is 228V.](https://preview.redd.it/qnvwaw20tlvd1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df4dcab5c1abd42a16ca98dc9d69884460faff58)

I also use HWInfo to monitor temperature info on my Windows 10 taskbar. My case lighting provides me with **temperature information:** it stays blue when the temperature is 50-60¬∞C, turns yellow when it exceeds 70¬∞C, and becomes fully red when it hits 90¬∞C. At the time of the incident, **it was blue.** Which made sense because I wasn‚Äôt doing anything heavy, just watching a YouTube video with a few open tabs.

https://preview.redd.it/4oaupph2tlvd1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=201a6205058295aba5abd021723ff8ebd4b28440

I live in a two-room apartment alone, where there is **no cooking** (except tea and coffee). I use it mainly as my office and have made sure that **no cockroaches (either American or German), lizards, or mice** can live here. That‚Äôs why I have the courage to keep my large PC case on the floor to ensure **maximum airflow.**

So, despite all these precautions, why did my GPU suddenly **catch fire?** What‚Äôs worse, had I not been near my PC and quickly disconnected the power cord, the fire could have easily **spread to the rest of the PC and possibly my entire apartment!**

I‚Äôve been reading about other Zotac users on Reddit who have faced similar issues, and many have reported receiving **defective, refurbished cards** in return. That would be a nightmare for me. In a country like mine, where the parcel system is very complicated, I simply can‚Äôt afford to spend more time and energy dealing with such a hassle again.

I hope Zotac will send me a **brand new, non-refurbished, defect-free** card to prevent any further trouble. If I receive a defective product, I‚Äôll have no choice but to create YouTube videos **exposing this dreadful incident** and Zotac‚Äôs poor handling of such issues.

Update on this post here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/s/fZZkXK4FEj

So it went to court. Boomer took the stand in her own defense. 

This is her story:

It's a day after a major snowstorm. Innocent boomer is driving around town when she gets an emergency phone call from her boomer friend, so she pulls into the only space she can find which also happens to be an accessible (handicap) space.. 1 out of 3 spaces, and the other 2 are not yet plowed out. The ""emergency"" is her boomer friend calling to tell her she hasn't been plowed out yet.

Officer (me) comes along and tells her to finish up her phone call and leave because she doesn't have a permit.

She finds the fact that the other 2 accessible spots haven't yet been plowed out is unacceptable and she needs answers, so she decides to turn off her car and go into the coffee shop after the officer (again, me) to ask why these spots aren't cleared yet, nevermind that her car is still parked in the only one that *is* clear.

The officer is very mean and nasty to her, so she returns to her car... then decides to go back in again, and this time the mean officer comes out and writes her a ticket.

/end scene

(That's not how things actually went down, but it still makes her look dumb, so I'll take it)

The judge is like ""...wut?"" and so starts asking her questions, like how did she know this call was an emergency, why didn't she just, like, leave the spot when she was done, what does the officer have to do with unplowed parking spaces, and, most importantly, why did she feel entitled (judge's word, not mine) to stay in that space to go into the coffee shop and argue?

Boomer lady talks over judge, doesn't listen to judge telling her she doesn't care about her snowed in friend (everyone here gets snowed in after storms, it's a fact of life) and keeps talking about her snowed in friend, pisses judge off.

Judge tells her: 1, not allowed to pick up your phone and look at it while you're driving (boomer told her she doesn't have/know how to use Bluetooth) to decide whether or not it's an emergency. 2, being snowed in and old isn't an emergency. 3, boomer lady doesn't seem to listen to instructions and comes off as argumentative based on judge's observations from her being on the stand, so she doesn't buy that the officer was mean and nasty and feels there's much more to this story, even makes a point to tell boomer that the officer cut her a break in the beginning as per her own story.

Judge found her guilty, told her she was entitled and reamed her out for the phone and sitting in the accessible to argue.

Boomer puts up her hand and says she wants to add more to her testimony. Judge says, ""No, we're done,"" and ends session.",11,1729297030.0,BoomersBeingFools,3,1.0,False

I live in Kansas City, but I've spent most of my life in the NYC metro. I moved here in 2015 for a great job, and I've been here since. I live alone in a nice, modern home in the South Hyde Park area. I love living inside the city and don't see myself living far away from an urban area.

I'm handsome, slim, and in great shape. I have deep, dark eyes and dark hair peppered with greys. I keep my facial hair short and well-groomed. I don't currently have any tattoos or piercings.

I pass regular background checks due to my job so you know I'm not shady. I have no debt or unpaid bills. I'm not addicted to anything. I don't need to be taught basic adult skills like how to care for myself or my home. You won't have to pick up after me or take an overwhelming share of the mental load. I've even kept my plants alive for years! Hopefully, you've got stability and minimal drama in your life. Ideally, you're independent and have a job that you enjoy. 

Politically, I'm a very passionate progressive/liberal. If you have some ""conservative"" values, that may not necessarily be a source of conflict. However, if you're a supporter of the modern Republican party and the MAGA movement, we are not a good fit. I'm not a religious person, but it is okay if you are as long as you can accept that I am not. Lastly, I do not have children and would prefer to date someone without children or whose kids are older and independent.

Except for a fulfilling relationship with a loving partner, I have a happy and comfortable life that doesn't want for anything. I'm capable, confident, independent, and have my life together. I want to meet someone with the intent of developing an enduring relationship. We can proceed at a pace that makes sense for us.

-------------------------
**Some things I enjoy:**

* **Food**: I have a very adventurous palate and love trying new foods. I avoid eating at the same restaurant twice to force myself to broaden my food experiences. If you're a vegan/vegetarian, that's fine! I'm open to the idea of some version of vegetarianism myself. I'm a competent cook, but I don't enjoy cooking. I'd prefer a partner who does. I promise that I'm great at doing the dishes and cleaning up in the kitchen.

* **Fitness**: My health is important, especially as I get older. I exercise regularly and also run. I'd love someone who prioritizes their health and fitness as well.

* **Coffee**: My COVID project was learning to appreciate coffee. My home ""cafe"" looks like a meth lab. I love it. I'll make you a great, fresh cup of pour-over in the morning. 

* **Riding**: I own a modern-retro scooter (a la Vespa) and enjoy riding it around the city. Don't worry, you do not need to get on the scooter if you don't want to. I promise I ride safely and with proper gear, and never speed or get on the highway.

* **Therapy**: I have been seeing a therapist for about half a year, and I'm finding it invaluable. After my previous relationships failed, I felt it was important to work on myself and set up future relationships for success. I think everyone would benefit from therapy at various points in their life.

* **Politics**: I'm a ""political junkie"". I frequently read articles and listen to podcasts. I also have a great deal of interest in the Supreme Court.

* **Movies**: I'm a huge cinephile and enjoy going to the theater. 

* **Music**: I love live music. I'm tolerant of most genres but gravitate towards indie, pop, and EDM. I like discovering new music, so if you want to share something you're vibing to and think I might like it, please share it with me.

* **Gaming**: I love to play board games with a group or my partner. I especially like games that involve some sort of social component and intuition, like The Resistance. Going out for trivia nights at bars is also one of my favorite things to do. I sometimes play single-player video games that allow me to stop at any time.

* **Cleanliness**: I'm probably the tidiest man you'll ever meet. I keep both my home and myself tidy. I'm something of a minimalist as well. I am not a big fan of collecting tons of trinkets and knickknacks and would not do well with a hoarder.

* **Drugs**: I have no dependencies or addictions whatsoever. I only drink socially and in moderation. I don't smoke *anything*, and I don't want to date someone who smokes a lot of anything. It smells gross and makes you taste gross. I sometimes enjoy a low-dose edible or a psychedelic. It's okay with me if you casually enjoy alcohol, marijuana, or ""lighter"" drugs more often than I do. 

* **Traveling**: I'm more of a homebody, but I like road trips. I want to drive across the country in a camper someday. I enjoy hiking and ""glamping"", but don't love prolonged camping. I would be agreeable to traveling far and wide with a partner.

It is perfectly fine if you don't share all my interests. I want you to be your own person with your own passions. As long as we align on our core values and ideals, the rest is not all that important.

------------
Please be serious about meeting in person. I don't want to text endlessly. If you're interested, feel free to reach out to me via chat or Reddit mail (preferred). **Please include a picture of your face with your message and describe yourself physically**. It's not much different than if we were on a dating app. I **will** ask for a picture if you didn't include one to start. Being weird about this would lead me to believe you're not serious and I'll likely move on.

------------
If you're **long-distance** (i.e. more than 2 hours away) and still interested, feel free to message me, but *only if* you're willing to make an actual effort to meet me in person after chatting for a bit. Ideally, you're in a position where you'll be able to relocate to Kansas City to live with me in a hypothetical future in which we're both committed to one another.

1g6wj4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoSleepOOC/comments/1g6wj4d/on_the_topic_of_events_and_consequences/,On the topic of Events and Consequences,"I'm sure like most people posting questions in this sub, an author posting a story may have some challenges meeting the guidelines for posting an acceptable horror story that fits the scope of r/NoSleep. I wanted to touch on *Events and Consequences*, and how to avoid the potential consequence of having your post removed because your square shaped story didn't fit into the round hole of r/NoSleep.

# Events Guidelines

>On r/nosleep, an ""event"" is when the main/posting character experiences something scary, such as encountering a ghost at work or finding a corpse in the trunk of their newly-purchased car.

>The event must be a major plot point in the story. This applies to every post on r/nosleep, including every part of a series; if any part of your story/series lacks an event, it'll be removed.

# Consequence Guidelines

>On r/nosleep, a ""consequence"" is an experience which follows the event as a direct result, such as the ghost you encountered at work has followed you home and is constantly hurting you or the corpse you discovered in your car's trunk turns out to be a murder victim and yours was the only DNA found on it so you're now on the run from the police.

>The consequence must be a major plot point in the story. This applies to every post on r/nosleep, including every part of a series; if any part of your story/series lacks a consequence, it'll be removed.

I believe it is stated that a horror story can be written without *consequences*, but a r/NoSleep story must have them. Your square shaped story could be perfectly scary in its own right, but just needs to find another hole / sub to live in. I think authors need to understand that when getting into r/NoSleep and need to properly identify it themselves. But there are nuances and it isn't always easy to define.

Both of these topics are subjective, as all art is. I want to take the examples given in the guidelines and kind of pick them apart.

# Events Examples:

>My Tinder/Bumble date took me somewhere secluded and romantic to tell me they're a serial killer and attack me.

>On my way home from work, I was jumped by a werewolf and mauled horribly.

>Last week at the coffee shop, the barista called out my name and someone else, who looked exactly like me, reached for my coffee at the same time I did.

Horror is the goal, right? These events have a different levels of severity. Being mauled by a werewolf? Extremely violent and traumatic and definitely a trigger going to a consequence. 

Going on a date and finding out they're a serial killer? I would say is close to the werewolf (in that the attack happened immediately after), but lured in with a false sense of safety first. 

Finding an unsuspecting twin in a coffee shop? Its a shock, but is it horrifying? This is what I would like to touch on. What if the event is even more subtle than this? Leaving breadcrumbs for the reader to discover the event happened earlier via a horrifying realization? 

Does an event have to innately be 'Horrifying' in the moment? I would argue that it doesn't have to be *in the moment*. But the event should set up the main character for a *consequence* that will follow before the story's conclusion. Here is a scenario of a subtle event that I would think be acceptable:

>I was messaging my significant other to meet up later at a friends place I haven't met yet. They messaged me the address and I agreed I'd be there later that evening after work.

In the moment? Not terrifying. But as an author, this is the event that *should* lead to a terrifying *consequence*. Because without a following *consequence*, this event is meaningless. This leads us to consequences.



# Consequence Examples:

>My date tried to kill me after telling me they're a serial killer; we were in the middle of nowhere with no one around to help me. I barely survived fighting off my ""date"" and made it to the nearest road, where a passing motorist found me and offered to call 911. Then I noticed the guy in the back seat of the car was the serial killer and had to run again.

>A cloud covered the full moon, allowing me to escape from the werewolf; when I got home, I noticed a bite mark on my shoulder and that patch of skin began to itch.

>My ""identical twin"" turned out to be my doppelganger, who started following me everywhere I went and has been trying to kill me ever since. I'm in hiding but don't know how long I'll be safe.

Its clear that the cases for the serial killer and werewolf have obvious consequences. Either a killer is attempting turn you into the ending of a 80s slasher flick or you are cursed with lycanthropy to become a monster yourself. Both events leaving a lasting consequence on the character. The doppelganger? What turns from a curious happenstance of someone looking just like you into being stalked by a skinwalker like person to be killed and replaced. All of these outline a direct consequence to the character. But must it *directly* be that way? Let me bring up my example again, but this time the *consequence*.

>I make it to my significant other's friend's apartment and knock on the door. The door opens and an angry, burly man lets me inside of the apartment and I find my significant other beaten, gagged and tied to a chair. Next to them is another person I don't know in the same state. I am given a gun and told to shoot the person I don't know. If I refuse, they would shoot my significant other  and let the other free. Either way, I would be released after.

This, I feel, outlines a *consequence* for the action of showing up to a friends house the character didn't know and is given a horrible moral dilemma. While the lasting *consequence* does not directly affect the main character, it affects those they care about. No matter what happens, they get to walk free and tell the tale to r/NoSleep but are burdened with the memory of a horrible choice. 

So, to bring focus to the whole point of this post. Where is the line for what can be determined an *Event* or a *Consequence?* Allowing the reader to piece things together instead of spoon feeding them a direct narrative creates interesting story telling. World building can be done, but still wrapped up within 40k words. 

But when walking the narrow line, how do you define where that line is when defining what an event and consequence is?

I've come across a bit of a moral dilemma. There is a police officer I've had a few encounters with, and I'm wanting to ask for his number.

For context I (28F) was recently attacked by a neighbor at the end of September. The assault happened about a block from my house, it's a neighbor that let's her dog run wild around the neighborhood. The dog is malnourished and mangey, and doesn't let anyone but it's 'mom' touch it. The dog had attacked my porch cat the day prior, and when I saw it was loose again I went to the house to either
 A.) Catch the dog and bring it to animal control
B.) Get one of the kids to bring the dog inside
C.) Get the owner to bring the dog inside 

No one was home, so I tried option A. About 10 minutes of a round and round chase adjacent to a scene from Tom and Jerry, the owner pulls up in an Uber and immediately starts yelling at me for 'charging at her dog'. We argue back and forth before she throws a coffee in my face and tackles me like shes doing a belly flop at the pool. In hindsight I think she may have been intoxicated, the hair trigger in which she snapped from verbal to physical can only be explained by intoxication or extreme anger control issues. I promise there was no smack talk, no swearing, no 'yo mamas' or anything that would warrent someone to start swinging. 
But I digress. Someone saw me getting my a$$ beat and called the cops. 

*Enter the police officer that this post is all about*

An hour after I dusted myself off and limped home, an officer knocked on my door responding to the 911 call. He took my statement and photos of the injuries (I'll admit I accidentally flashed him a bit. There was a bite mark right on my ribs and I just yanked my shirt up without even thinking about the fact that I didn't have anything on under it. Given this, I don't want the officer to think I was intentionally trying to flash him and cross a boundary) 
I did kinda of check him out, I really like red heads, plus he had very interesting tattoos. But I didn't really think about him much after that. Until yesterday that is. Yesterday I went to the police station in order to pick my assailant out of a line up. And giiiiirl let me tell you, the butterfly's I was feeling. At first I thought it was the nerves of being in a police station to begin with, cops do tend to make me a little nervous, especially in groups. But thinking about it, it was him making my stomach do flips. And it could be wishful thinking on my part, but I felt like he was subtley giving me 'the eyes' during our brief interaction. I tend to be the type of person to miss obvious come-ons and have a hard time clocking when someone is flirting with me. However I did feel ~something~ weather it be my own projected attraction or something more.

I didn't see a wedding band, but I do know people in high risk jobs such as his won't wear one while on duty. Would it even be ethical to ask him out for a date? He's technically on the job, it feels very morally gray. Could it be negatively reflected on me and my on going assault case? Cause a conflict of interest or make it seem like I'm trying to further my own means by flirting? Should I wait until the case has been resolved in court?
And how would I even go about asking him out? Call up the station and ask to be transferred to him? Leave my number for him at the front desk? 
Any advice, insight, or stories of similar situations are welcome and appreciated. I will do my best to update this thread as things develop. ",1,1729295893.0,okstorytime,0,1.0,False

I was originally going to do this for the entire modern era so far, but then that would‚Äôve taken a really long time.

Before you proceed, there are some points I have to make...

‚Ä¢ For this part and future Series‚Äô parts, I‚Äôm not including any of the villains, yet I would still occasionally include characters who are not really evil but have done something bad, or even characters with a jerky attitude.

‚Ä¢ Each character is fitted with a quote, but their quote is said by them in the episode that they are representing and not their entire tenure.

‚Ä¢ Please don‚Äôt take this seriously, as a bunch of the following points are used for comedy purposes.

Anyway, let's proceed...

/ / /

1) The Ninth Doctor

First Seen: Grabbing Rose‚Äôs hand and telling her to run from the plastic men (because Autons aren‚Äôt mentioned by name in the episode).

Last Seen: Regenerating into Ten after kissing Ro-THAT WAS A GENETIC TRANSFER.

3) Charles Dickens

First Seen: Feeling old, while waiting for his stage call, and feels like he‚Äôs seen it all.

Last Seen: On BBC Breakfast, where he‚Äôs interviewed about his new Christmas Special, A Christmas Carol.

‚ÄúWhat the Shakespeare‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

/ / /

4) Mickey Smith

First Seen: Having lunch with Rose, while having fun with her.

Last Seen: Hugging Martha, which is just what she needed after their encounter with a Sontaran and Ten.

Last Seen: Facing extermination with dignity, after gaining proof that the Daleks know who she is.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a very violent young woman.‚Äù

/ / /

6) Adam Mitchell

First Seen: Being a witness to Van Statten firing someone for having an opinion.

Last Seen: Failing to live a quiet life, since his mum snapped her fingers and opened his head.

Fun Fact: He was kicked out of the TARDIS for breaking rules, even though the Doctor was ‚Äòin charge‚Äô.

‚ÄúGreat big alien death machine defeated by a flight of stairs.‚Äù

7) Cathica Santini Khandeni

First Seen: Along with Suki, as they both meet a test who‚Äôs asking them a lot of obvious questions.

Last Seen: Discussing with Nine on what‚Äôs to come about of Satellite 5‚Äôs future after Max had been destroyed.

‚ÄúOh no, you don‚Äôt. You should have promoted me years back.‚Äù

8) Pete Tyler

First Seen: Getting married to Jackie, where his daughter and her time traveling friend are present.

Last Seen: Dying on a road with a blond girl by his side.

Fun Fact: He was shorter than Rose thought he would be, and that‚Äôs not the only thing about him that surprised her.

9) Jack Harkness

First Seen: Using his binoculars to check through the night sky during the Blitz, and soon catches sight of Rose.

Last Seen: Leaving Thirteen with a recorded message after her and her gang to stop the Dalek armies. She doesn't mind.

/ / /

10) Nancy

‚ÄúYou think so, Ernie? Then answer this. Jim is sitting there right next to you. So who‚Äôs typing?‚Äù

/ / /

11) Idris Hopper

First Seen: Asking Nine if he‚Äôs going to book an appointment to see the Mayor.

Last Seen: Trying to stop Nine from seeing the Mayor.

Fun Fact: He‚Äôs polite to everyone he‚Äôs with, yet he apparently is over protective of the Mayor, which could hint that he‚Äôs a Slitheen too.

‚ÄúThe Lord Mayor says thank you for popping by. She‚Äôd love to have a chat, but, er, she‚Äôs up to her eyes in paperwork. Perhaps if you could make an appointment for next week?‚Äù

/ / /

12) Rodrick

First Seen: Guiding a confused Rose to her podium on the Deadly Weakest Link.

Last Seen: Getting exterminated by the Daleks due to his selfish attitude.

Fun Fact: During his life, he never found out what actually happened to all the eliminated contestants on the Deadly Weakest Link (including Rose).

‚ÄúRight, that‚Äôs the end of tactical voting. You‚Äôre on your own now.‚Äù

/ / /

13) Lynda Moss

First Seen: Being Nine‚Äôs support when he‚Äôs transmatted onto the Killer Big Brother House.

Last Seen: Thanks to a Dalek exterminating the glass, she got killed by open space.

Fun Fact: After being accepted to join Nine in the TARDIS, she says that she wouldn‚Äôt get in the way, but he wouldn‚Äôt even mind if she did get in the way. Rose, however, would mind about that happening. As for Jack, well...we should already know what he would think.

1g6vzro,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1g6vzro/my_aa_meetings_are_getting_dark_part_1/,My AA meetings are getting dark (part 1),"Hey guys, first time poster here. To make a long story short I got into an accident while drunk, and got sentenced to 50 hours of AA and community service along with a hefty fine with a suspended license dangling off the side of this shit sundae. The minor details don‚Äôt matter for the context of this story so I won't speak on it. So yeah, it's a Friday night. Prime time for bar hopping but here I am sitting in an artificially lit room with bad coffee, and slightly worse company. Not to say that they were bad people, but why would we be compatible? I know, alcohol isn't all there is to life, and I agree with you. But this place is such a downer that I can't help but feel a little ill will. It's better than the county so I can't really complain that much. It's my first night though, maybe one or two of the folks will grow on me. 

‚ÄúI'd like to start off this meeting by addressing the new person in our group. Would you like to introduce yourself?‚Äù

He passes me this brightly colored stick with a feather tied to it with neon string.

‚ÄúUh the name is Mike, and I got court ordered to be here. I know I'm supposed to say I'm an alcoholic but honestly I just like drinking. I don't have a problem with it, I'm just here for my hours.‚Äù

I pass the stick back to the group leader

‚ÄúWell, thank you for sharing Mike, I just want to remind you that if you want those hours signed off you have to participate.‚Äù

I nod submissively 

‚ÄúAlright, who wants to go first?‚Äù

As the group trades experiences, and the talking stick amongst each other I see this woman walk in. She looks pretty from a distance, but when she gets closer you can tell that she's not keeping up with herself. Dirty clothes, a faint smell. She sits next to me since that was the only free chair there was. 

‚ÄúLet's take a moment to welcome the new face in the room, Brian can you pass the talking stick to her?‚Äù

Brian passes the talking stick to the mystery woman but she slowly extends her arm like she's hesitant about the mere act of speaking a word. Though she does take it after a moment. 

‚ÄúHi everyone my name is Evelyn, and I have a drinking problem.‚Äù 

Everyone murmurs a hi Evelyn, I parrot the crowd after a short delay. 

‚ÄúIt all started about two weeks ago. Before that I wouldn't even consider having a drink if it wasn't the weekend. I don't know what changed in me but I started having these intense migraines that for some reason only alcohol could soothe. It spiraled from there, and here I am horribly sober, and unsure if this is the right choice. The doctor said I'm fine, and everything checks out but I don't know.‚Äù

The group leader chimes up after motioning for the talking stick.

‚ÄúThank you for sharing Evelyn, and no, you made the right decision. Life is hard but alcohol only makes life that much harder.

‚ÄúWhat a load of crap.‚Äù I thought. The only thing that makes a bad day good is a cold beer.

‚ÄúWe go by the twelve step program here at AA Evelyn, are you familiar with it?‚Äù

She shakes her head

‚ÄúWell the first step to being alcohol free is to admit that we are powerless in our addiction. And the second step is to acknowledge there is a power that can restore us to sanity.‚Äù

Evelyn motions for the talking stick which The group leader handed happily.

‚Äúgive yourself over to a higher power?‚Äù

They pass the stick again. Talking stick? More like a passing stick. Jesus, this 50 hours of this is going to drive me insane. 

‚ÄúYes, it doesn't have to be a specific religion. Any belief will work.‚Äù

She closes her eyes in acknowledgement. He continues to say that they go by the buddy system. That means that everyone has one person in this group that they can rely on so that they're not going through the twelve steps alone. And wouldn't you guess it, everyone already has a buddy. So it would only be natural that I became Evelyn's buddy. Meeting ends, I get my first two hours signed off. I turn to the door, and when I get out I see Evelyn smoking a cigarette. She looks kinda happy. 

‚ÄúYou got another one of those?‚Äù

She hands me her pack, and I pull one out. I pull out a lighter and light it. I handed her pack back to her.

‚Äúthanks.‚Äù

I grunt as I exhale the smoke.

‚ÄúYou're welcome.‚Äù

We both stand there for a weird amount of time without talking. I break the silence.

‚ÄúSo, uh want my number? Since we're buddies now it'll just be easier.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

She hands me her phone and I put in my number. 

‚ÄúIt was my first night too.‚Äù

I mumbled out. The cold air stinging my lips as I breathe out to speak. 

‚ÄúIt was? Why are you here? By choice or‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúI got court ordered to. Two hours down forty eight to go.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat sounds rough. Don't worry I'll make it easy for you.‚Äù

She smiles cutely. I blush slightly from her reply. 

‚ÄúDon't worry about it, I can handle it.‚Äù

With that I put out the cigarette with my boot, and I said goodbye. 

Now let's fast forward to the next week since nothing of real importance happened. She didn't call, or text besides one text about half a week in. She just said that the twelve step program was helping her. I'm glad that this program actually does help people who want to quit get over their dependency with alcohol. I go into the next week with a renewed sense of vigor. I have someone counting on me to get them where they need to be. I walk in about five minutes early, the usual suspects are walking in, some are getting what I'm assuming to be a cup of motor oil. I look around the room for Evelyn. And there I saw her, in the same seat she was in before. I walk up to sit down next to her.

‚ÄúHow ya doin‚Äô?‚Äù 

She turns around, and I see a different woman. Not physically, but there is this light in her eyes that wasn't there before. 

‚ÄúYeah I'm great! My migraines even went away!‚Äù

She says beaming ear to ear.

‚ÄúHey that's great Evelyn! I'm happy to hear that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can't wait for the third step!‚Äù

She says it in a frantic tone. I thought at the time that she was just extremely motivated for self improvement, but now I'm not so sure.

The group sits down, and the group leader holds out the talking stick. Its neon colors are an utter eyesore. 

‚Äúwho wants to start first?‚Äù

Evelyn perks her hand up first with alarming speed that only I seem to have noticed.

‚ÄúI would love to start.‚Äù

The group leader smiles and hands her the talking stick

‚ÄúI'm so happy to see you doing so much better Evelyn.‚Äù

Evelyn grabs the stick with both hands. Her knuckles are turning white.

‚ÄúHi Evelyn here, I've been sober for one week, and I have to be honest I've never felt better! I need to know what the third step is.‚Äù

She passes the stick to the group leader as quickly as her hands would allow. The group leader takes it without regard to those twitchy movements. Was he trying to be polite? 

‚ÄúThe third step is to give yourself over to that God, utterly and completely.‚Äù

She closes her eyes and smiles hard. I thought this was insane. How is everyone just accepting this without even a grimace?

The rest of the group goes on as normal, I barely got my hours in with how distracted I was from that whole thing. When it finished I tried to just head to the bus stop. When Evelyn shows up from around the corner.

‚ÄúHey buddy! Where ya goin‚Äô?‚Äù

I put on a facsimile of a smile even though I felt a growing unease with her presence. 

‚ÄúOh I'm heading to the bus stop to go home.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can drive you!‚Äù

She says with that same grin, that light I once saw turned into a glint of madness with the way she was bending and moving like she was doing ballet moves while getting ready to play a round of football.

‚ÄúN-No I'm fine. Thanks though.""

I'm ashamed to admit it as a six foot man that weighs 215 pounds but this petite woman is scaring me. And there was no way I was going to let that woman know where I live. 

‚ÄúAw, why not? I just wanna show my buddy how much I care about them.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I'm fine, I like the walk home. It's really nice out tonight.‚Äù 

The smile twitches for a moment as she holds her eye contact.

‚ÄúWell if you insist!‚Äù

She snaps back to being animated again. 

‚ÄúGet home safe buddy.‚Äù

This is where we're caught up with the story. The next meeting is in a couple of days, and Evelyne just messaged me that she's embraced the third step. I'm not sure if being free is worth it.

When I got home, found that my wife decided to have a ""watch"" theme celebration. Should have known when she gifted me a pair of socks last night with watches all over them the direction this was going, lol. The picture below shows just a bit of my haul...A Man and His Watch book, a couple of watch themed coffee mugs (another vice of mine,) a watch gear inscribed ring and my first ever G-Shock 5600, the second most worn watch in space. She questions my sanity about the time I spend on this infernal habit, but she is absolutely an enabler who has bought me more watches than I have bought myself. Hope you all had fantastic days as well.

Does any one know of a textbook or book that lists the lingo used in sensory evaluation or just in taste testing in general? I was fortunate enough to land an R&D position and we do a lot of sensory evaluations and at a times I find it hard to find the proper words to describe what I am tasting. As of now, I have resources regarding lexicons for coffee and sensory science text books as well.

1g6vx5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minneapolis/comments/1g6vx5e/bike_lane/,Bike lane ,"F32 - Not sure who is right or wrong in the situation but you absolutely NO right to walk up to my car. 

Driving down lyndale (honestly bikers shouldn‚Äôt bike down lyndale or lake street, it‚Äôs super dangerous)

White, hipster looking dude was in the middle of the road, I told him it‚Äôs safer to use the bike lane (yes, there is a bike lane on lyndale) and he said something but didn‚Äôt hear. I turned into the parking lot that‚Äôs located behind caffetto coffee shop and he followed me and walked up to my car. 

First off - the privilege to walk up to any car is insane! White privileged to think it‚Äôs okay to do that without consequences.

My PTSD kicked in and I pulled out my mace as I exited the vehicle. He started screaming saying he had the right of way - at this point, I don‚Äôt care who is right or wrong, don‚Äôt walk up to me or my car.

I screamed and said - ‚Äúback up or I‚Äôll mace you, don‚Äôt fucking try me‚Äù over and over again. He wouldn‚Äôt back down, even as I walked away. To the point we‚Äôre both in a screaming match. People came out to hold him back and LIE to say I almost hit him on lyndale. 

He was inches from my face and all I said over and over again, to get out my face or I‚Äôll mace you. He then asked if I was sober. Like, how is that revenant? Also, I was completely sober. At this point I was shaking and just screaming to get him away from me. Couple people came out to calm him down, to talk to him like I was wrong in the situation. It was unbelievable.

Anyway,

I‚Äôm pro bike lanes! I think it‚Äôs amazing we‚Äôre able to create these bike friendly spaces for bikers but damn, don‚Äôt walk up to me and my car, that‚Äôs fucking privilege, people get killed over that.

1g6vvff,https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/1g6vvff/living_with_step_kids/,Living with Step kids ,"I recently got a house with my partner and his two boys. I‚Äôm having a VERY difficult time getting used to it and transitioning to this new life. 

For one, the house is so negative. Both boys fight constantly, about anything and everything. The older one who‚Äôs 7 constantly teases his little brother who‚Äôs 3. He pushes him, makes fun of him, etc. we‚Äôve both talked to him, put him in time out, taken away privileges when this happens and make him apologize, but it never stops. He says he likes doing it because it‚Äôs funny. 

Both boys throw HUGE fits if they‚Äôre told they need to do anything. For example, brushing teeth or cleaning up their toys. 

The older one also blows up if something goes wrong, or if he‚Äôs angry, and he gets angry pretty often. Last weekend, he put together his Lego wrong and said ‚Äúthis is stupid‚Äù, threw it, and then ran to his room and slammed the door. He has extreme reactions to small things and doesn‚Äôt know how to control his emotions. 

In addition to this, I absolutely love kids, and kids usually have always loved me, but I can‚Äôt seem to make a connection to either one. They both don‚Äôt say hi to me, or ask me for help, they only want their dad. He always makes them say hi and give me hugs, but they won‚Äôt go up and do it without him asking them. He says they like me, and I‚Äôm sure they do, but they don‚Äôt show it like other kids do. (I was an elementary teacher for 6 years, and was around hundreds of kids). 

My partner doesn‚Äôt seem to make them do jobs around the house, which I think is super important, like taking their plate to the sink when they‚Äôre done, or cleaning up their room, putting their clothes in the hamper. 

The other night, while my partner was trying to read them a story, the older one started throwing these decoration pumpkins I had on our coffee table. Like why? Why does he think he can do that? It made me sad because I had just got them last week and they were mine, and then he just acted like he didn‚Äôt care.

Lastly, this might be small in comparison to other things. But my cat doesn‚Äôt come out when they‚Äôre over. They yell, they‚Äôre loud, and my cat is terrified of them. She won‚Äôt come out until they go to bed at night. She won‚Äôt eat or drink all day because she avoids going out into the house.

I wish this transition was easier, I wish they could just be GOOD, just to be good, not because they‚Äôre told to. I wish they had it in them to be nice human beings. I‚Äôm concerned that I won‚Äôt ever transition into this family, and worry that I‚Äôll feel this way for years to come. ",1,1729294636.0,stepparents,5,0.67,False

By that I mean being able to find players to assist without a password and not having to pour a cup of coffee while you wait so you can stay awake.

I can only imagine what it was like to quick search for chalice dungeon coop and just... be summoned. No questions asked.

The game is great, but the sickly multiplayer scene is, frankly, a drag.

I don't really NEED help. I just wish I could fight a boss with other people, without having to put up a frigging ad in the newspaper, you know?

1g6vtbu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CameraWorksReviews/comments/1g6vtbu/best_drone_for_beginners/,Best drone for beginners,"You definitely don't want to drop a ton of cash right away, so I'd recommend starting with something like the DJI Mini 2 if you‚Äôve got a bit of a budget‚Äîit‚Äôs lightweight, 4K video, and is super easy to fly. If you want something cheaper, ill provide a solid list for you:

# 1. DJI Mini 2 ‚Äì The Premium Choice

* **Flight time**: 31 minutes
* **Camera**: 4K video, 12MP photos
* **Range**: 10km

The **DJI Mini 2** is the gold standard for beginners who want a reliable, feature-packed drone. The camera shoots in 4K, which means your vacation videos will look so good you might just become the family photographer by default. With a 31-minute flight time and 10km range, this thing can go the distance‚Äîliterally.

**Why it‚Äôs great for beginners**: It‚Äôs lightweight, easy to fly, and comes with **intuitive controls**. Even if you‚Äôve never flown a drone before, you‚Äôll feel like a pro in no time. Plus, the DJI Fly app is super user-friendly, giving you all the help you need to get airborne quickly.

# 2. Ryze Tello ‚Äì The Budget Pick

* **Flight time**: 13 minutes
* **Camera**: 720p video, 5MP photos
* **Range**: 100m

The **Ryze Tello** is perfect for those who want to dip their toes into the world of drones without draining their bank account. It‚Äôs simple, affordable, and fun to fly‚Äîideal for beginners and even kids.

**Why it‚Äôs great for beginners**: It‚Äôs controlled via a smartphone app, which makes flying a breeze. Plus, it‚Äôs compact and light, so you can fly it indoors without worrying about knocking over your favorite houseplant. The 720p camera isn‚Äôt going to win any awards, but it‚Äôs perfect for first-timers who just want to get a feel for the controls.

# 3. Holy Stone HS720E ‚Äì Best Value

* **Flight time**: 23 minutes
* **Camera**: 4K UHD video, 13MP photos
* **Range**: 1km

Looking for something with a bit more oomph? The **Holy Stone HS720E** offers excellent value for money, with a 4K camera and a ton of features usually reserved for pricier models. It‚Äôs equipped with GPS and an impressive 23-minute flight time, making it a great middle-ground option.

**Why it‚Äôs great for beginners**: The **GPS feature** helps stabilize the drone, making it easier to fly without worrying about drift. It also comes with **Follow Me mode**, so you can have it tail you like a loyal puppy while you jog, cycle, or show off at the beach.

# 4. Potensic T25 ‚Äì Best for Stability

* **Flight time**: 10 minutes
* **Camera**: 1080p HD video, 9MP photos
* **Range**: 300m

If you‚Äôre someone who prioritizes stability (and who doesn‚Äôt when it comes to flying?), the **Potensic T25** might be your go-to. It‚Äôs got GPS and altitude hold, which keeps it from bouncing around mid-air like a kid on a sugar rush.

**Why it‚Äôs great for beginners**: It‚Äôs built for **steady flying**, making it easier to control, especially for first-timers. The 1080p camera offers good video quality for the price, and it even has **one-button return-to-home**, which means fewer chances of losing your drone to the neighbor‚Äôs tree.

# 5. Hubsan H501S ‚Äì The All-Rounder

* **Flight time**: 20 minutes
* **Camera**: 1080p video, 10MP photos
* **Range**: 300m

The **Hubsan H501S** offers a little bit of everything for beginners. With a 1080p camera, GPS, and **Follow Me mode**, it‚Äôs a solid drone for those who want an affordable, feature-packed option without going overboard on the budget.

**Why it‚Äôs great for beginners**: This drone gives you a **balanced mix** of features without being overwhelming. The **Follow Me** and **altitude hold** features are ideal for newbies, and the 1080p camera is great for capturing some solid footage without needing to upgrade your entire computer to process 4K video.

# Comparison Table: Best Drones for Beginners

|**Drone**|**Flight Time**|**Camera**|**Range**|**Best For**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|DJI Mini 2|31 mins|4K video, 12MP|10km|Premium features and long-range flights|
|Ryze Tello|13 mins|720p video, 5MP|100m|Budget-friendly indoor flying|
|Holy Stone HS720E|23 mins|4K UHD, 13MP|1km|Value with premium-like features|
|Potensic T25|10 mins|1080p HD, 9MP|300m|Stability and ease of use|
|Hubsan H501S|20 mins|1080p video, 10MP|300m|All-rounder with balanced features|

# Understanding Drone Regulations

Before you get too excited and start launching your new drone into the sky, there‚Äôs one thing you absolutely need to know: **drone regulations**. Yes, I know‚Äîrules aren‚Äôt fun. But trust me, understanding the legal side of drone flying can save you from hefty fines, awkward conversations with law enforcement, or worse‚Äîhaving your drone grounded permanently. Plus, if you ever want to fly beyond your backyard, knowing the rules is crucial.

# 1. Do You Need to Register Your Drone?

If your drone weighs **over 250 grams** (about half a pound), you‚Äôll need to register it with the **Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)** in the United States. Luckily, registration is cheap (around $5), and it‚Äôs a one-time deal that lasts three years. It‚Äôs like registering your car‚Äîonly way simpler and with fewer trips to the DMV.

|**Drone Model**|**Weight (grams)**|**Need to Register?**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|DJI Mini 2|249g|No|
|Ryze Tello|80g|No|
|Holy Stone HS720E|460g|Yes|
|Potensic T25|185g|No|
|Hubsan H501S|410g|Yes|

As you can see, some drones like the **DJI Mini 2** are built specifically to avoid this registration requirement, coming in just under the weight limit. That means you can fly right out of the box without any extra paperwork.

# 2. Where Can You Fly Your Drone?

Not everywhere is fair game when it comes to flying drones. Here are the main rules to keep in mind:

* **Stay below 400 feet**: This keeps you clear of most manned aircraft, like helicopters and planes.
* **Always keep your drone in sight**: No, you can‚Äôt send it off to scout for you while you‚Äôre sipping coffee at a distance. You need to be able to see it at all times.
* **Stay away from airports**: Airports are a no-fly zone, and flying near one without permission can land you in serious trouble (and not the fun kind). You must stay at least **5 miles away from any airport**.
* **Don‚Äôt fly over people**: Especially big crowds. It‚Äôs not only dangerous, but also illegal in many areas.
* **Respect privacy**: Flying your drone into your neighbor‚Äôs backyard or peeping through windows is a surefire way to have the police knocking on your door. Keep it respectful and legal.

# 3. Special No-Fly Zones

Certain areas, like **national parks, military bases**, and **government buildings**, have strict no-fly policies. These areas are restricted for a reason‚Äîwhether it's for security, safety, or just preserving peace and quiet for wildlife (because even bears deserve some chill time).

To make things easier, the **FAA** has a handy app called **B4UFLY** that shows you where you can and can‚Äôt fly. It‚Äôs like having a drone pilot‚Äôs map in your pocket, so you never accidentally take off in a restricted area.

# 4. Do You Need a License?

If you‚Äôre just flying for fun, good news: **no license required**! However, if you‚Äôre planning to fly your drone for business purposes‚Äîlike filming real estate properties, weddings, or making some sweet drone cinematography for YouTube‚Äîthen you‚Äôll need a **Part 107 license** from the FAA.

The **Part 107 exam** isn‚Äôt too difficult, but it does require studying. It covers everything from weather patterns to understanding airspace restrictions, so be prepared to hit the books (or Google).

# 5. Penalties for Breaking Drone Rules

Nobody likes penalties, but if you ignore drone regulations, you could face fines of **up to $27,500** for civil violations and even **criminal charges** in extreme cases. Yikes!

So, as cool as drones are, it‚Äôs crucial to respect the rules of the air. **Stick to legal flying areas**, follow the height restrictions, and you‚Äôll be in the clear.

# Beginner Drone Accessories You Might Need

So, you‚Äôve got your shiny new drone, and you‚Äôre ready to become the next big thing in drone photography (or at least impress your friends). But before you head out for your first flight, there are a few **essential accessories** that can make your drone-flying experience even better. Whether it‚Äôs extending your flight time or protecting your investment, these extras are worth considering.

# 1. Extra Batteries ‚Äì Stay in the Air Longer

Drones, especially beginner models, don‚Äôt have the longest flight times‚Äîmost offer anywhere from **10 to 30 minutes** on a single charge. If you want to spend more time soaring through the skies and less time waiting for a recharge, **extra batteries** are a must-have. Trust me, the last thing you want is your drone running out of juice just as you‚Äôre about to nail that perfect shot.

* **Pro tip**: Make sure the extra batteries are compatible with your specific drone model. Some brands, like DJI, offer **official battery packs**, while others may have third-party options available.

|**Drone Model**|**Flight Time (Single Battery)**|**Recommended Number of Extra Batteries**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|DJI Mini 2|31 minutes|2 extra batteries|
|Ryze Tello|13 minutes|1 extra battery|
|Holy Stone HS720E|23 minutes|2 extra batteries|

# 2. Propeller Guards ‚Äì For the Clumsy Flyers Among Us

If you‚Äôre like me, you might be prone to a few crashes in the early stages of your drone flying career. **Propeller guards** are the best way to protect your drone from these inevitable bumps and bruises. They‚Äôre especially useful for indoor flights or when you‚Äôre flying in areas with obstacles (like trees, poles, or curious pets).

* **Bonus**: They can also help keep people safe. You definitely don‚Äôt want a runaway drone smacking into someone, and these guards will help soften the blow.

# 3. Carrying Case ‚Äì Protect Your Drone On the Go

If you plan on taking your drone to different locations (and you should‚Äîit‚Äôs way more fun!), a **good carrying case** is essential. It‚Äôll keep your drone, controller, and accessories organized and protected from bumps, drops, and bad weather.

* Look for cases that are **custom-molded** to fit your drone model, especially if you‚Äôve got a higher-end model like the DJI Mini 2. Many cases even come with extra compartments for your **batteries, chargers**, and **propeller guards**.

# 4. Landing Pad ‚Äì Not Just for Show

If you‚Äôre flying in areas with grass, dirt, or sand, a **landing pad** is a great accessory to have. It gives your drone a **smooth, clean surface** to take off from and land on, preventing dirt and debris from messing with the propellers or camera.

* **Pro tip**: Some landing pads come with reflective material, making it easier to spot your landing zone when flying in low-light conditions.

# 5. Spare Propellers ‚Äì Because Accidents Happen

Even with propeller guards, there‚Äôs always a chance you might damage or break a propeller‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôre still getting the hang of things. Having **spare propellers** on hand will save you from having to cut your flying session short. Most drone kits come with a few spares, but it‚Äôs always a good idea to stock up.

* Make sure you buy the **correct size and type** of propellers for your drone model. Not all propellers are universal, so check your manual before ordering replacements.

1g6vp31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mildlynomil/comments/1g6vp31/losing_it/,Losing it,"Long post. I'm venting, but if anyone has a similar experience, please feel free to share insight.

My boyfriend's mother came to stay with us for a few months this summer and will be returning to Egypt this weekend. It's the first time I met her and she...is so sweet! She barely speaks English (and I barely speak their language, tho BF is trying to teach me), but I can tell she has nothing but the kindest intentions. She lives for four things: her kids, her favorite soccer team, the Egyptian version of telenovellas, and, the big one, cooking food for people.

I can't keep her out of the kitchen. If I am working in the kitchen, she will ask if she can help. She took it upon herself to make sure coffee is made when we wake up, every day, without fail. If we don't specifically make plans for dinner, dinner will be made by 5pm, without fail. She will serve large portions of the most carb-and-protein-heavy food I've had in a long time. I have gained, and this is true, 30 goddamn pounds since she arrived.

Before she came to visit, BF and I would eat out about once a week, I'd cook when I have the time, and we'd eat dressed up leftovers, takeout, or semi-scratch or frozen meals the other 4ish nights. We also normally only ate one meal a day. BF doesn't have an active job and doesn't eat much in general and I am often too busy to get a solid lunch so I snack here and there until dinner. Having MIL cook seemed like a bit of a godsend... at first.

I can't wait for her to leave. Why?

Reason #1: I'm tired of the food she makes. A lot of it is super good, but it's also ethnic and my body is craving variety. She has several dishes on rotation but she makes so much of it that we will be eating leftovers for days before it's gone. She also microwaves everything. She doesn't put the pan back in the oven for a bit, she doesn't add a little milk or broth to help rehydrate it, she just nukes it. 

Reason #2: I want to be able to clean my kitchen and know it will stay that way. I have the day off this coming monday and I know I will spend the whole day wiping flour off of every spice bottle, cleaning the fridge, re-organizing cabinets, deep cleaning the range and the oven, and scrubbing the floor. I tried staying on top of the mess for the first few weeks, but I quickly burnt out and I've been settling for wiping counters and sweeping when I have the chance. I'm just too busy and too exhausted most days to basically deep clean the kitchen every night. I know I'm neurotic, I know it's gonna suck just as much if/when kids happen, but in the meantime, my kitchen is mine and if you're going to be in there, please, for the love of the moon, I'm begging you, leave it how you found it.

 Reason #3: I want to eat food without pulling hair out of my mouth. I was able to get past this for a bit, but every time I see another hair in my food, I lose all enjoyment in what I'm eating.

Reason #4: I knew she didn't wash her hands while she cooks. That was evident from the oil and flour coating every spice bottle we own and some of the dishes. Last week, I was standing outside the bathroom and heard the toilet flush immediately before she opened the door. I haven't been able to enjoy her food since.

I have tried to teach her a few habits when it comes to cleaning like wiping off the range as soon as she spills something. That lasted about a week. The language barrier makes it super tough to communicate. I'm trying to learn but Arabic is one of the most difficult languages for an English speaker to learn. She also can't understand me half the time, and using a translator app is cumbersome at best. Our deepest conversations are over text, and I know she translates every word.

I've talked to BF about my concerns and hang-ups. He said he thinks she has a learning disability. He also said his father used to beat her because she couldn't keep the house clean. Hearing that killed me. 

She will probably be coming to visit again next year, but she really wants to live here full-time. I will probably have a different job (hopefully with fewer hours) and will be better able to establish firm boundaries (hopefully in Arabic) , but BF said he would want to get her an apartment if she moved, which should help. Our bedroom has also not seen as much action since she's been here, and I'm hoping my drive comes back when she leaves.

Tl;dr: I am super neurotic and just can't with MIL's hygiene, specifically around food.

As someone who's been through the process and learned a ton along the way, I thought I'd share a more detailed guide to help you navigate the exciting world of blogging.

So, grab a cup of coffee and let's dive in!

# 1. Find Your Niche and Voice

* **Identify your unique angle:** What fresh perspective can you bring to your chosen niche?
* **Know your audience:** Research who you're writing for and what they want to read.

# 2. Select the Right Platform

* **WordPress:** Great for customization and scalability. Perfect if you want full control.
* **Medium:** Ideal for writers who want to focus solely on content without worrying about technicalities.
* **Ghost:** A happy medium between WordPress and Medium, offering simplicity with some customization options.
* **Substack:** Excellent for newsletter-style blogs with built-in monetization features.

Consider factors like ease of use, customization options, and potential for growth when making your choice.

# 3. Secure Your Online Identity

* **Choose a memorable domain name:** Make it relevant to your niche and easy to spell.
* **Set up professional email:** Use your domain name (e.g., [you@yourblog.com](mailto:you@yourblog.com)) for a polished look.
* **Claim social media handles:** Ensure consistency across platforms to build your brand.

# 4. Design Your Blog

* **Start with a clean, responsive theme:** Mobile-friendliness is non-negotiable in 2024.
* **Prioritize readability:** Choose fonts and colors that are easy on the eyes.
* **Incorporate your branding:** Use consistent colors, logos, and imagery across your site.
* **Optimize for speed:** A fast-loading site is crucial for user experience and SEO.

* **Craft SEO-friendly titles and meta descriptions:** These are crucial for attracting clicks from search results.
* **Use header tags (H1, H2, etc.) effectively:** This helps both readers and search engines understand your content structure.
* **Internal linking:** Connect your posts to keep readers on your site longer.

# 9. Monitor and Analyze Your Progress

* **Set up Google Analytics:** Track visitor behavior, popular posts, and traffic sources.
* **Pay attention to engagement metrics:** Comments, shares, and time on page can indicate what's resonating with your audience.

Then last weekend, I was out when I saw him with another guy at a restaurant having an intimate dinner. It's just the two of them hugging and flirting with each other. When I saw that, I felt so hurt and went home early since I was with my co-workers at that time.¬†

We've been on 2 dates since I saw him with another guy, and I still enjoy his company and am still in love with him. However, the jealousy's killing me, and I can't really open up about it with him since we are not in a relationship. Last night, we were cuddling on the bed when I asked him what our relationship was, and I finally told him that I had feelings for him and if he felt the same way. He told me that we should just take things slow enjoy the moment and eventually get there. I asked him that since we do not have a label yet, are we allowed to go out with other people. He got angry and told me that we should focus on each other. He also told me that I am the only one for him and he has not been happier with his life now that we're seeing each other. He was asking me if I liked him since I asked that question and if I was seeing someone else while we were dating. I reassured him that I love him; he's the only one, and I haven't gone out with anyone else since we started seeing each other. I also asked him if he had seen someone else since we started going out, and he denied it.¬†We made up after that and had the most amazing sex.

It still bothers me that he lied about seeing someone else, and I don't want to confront him about it as well since technically we are not in a relationship yet. I am really confused right now since I told him on our third date that I wanted monogamy, and he said that he wanted that as well. Do you think his date with that guy was a one-time thing? Do you think he has changed his mind after going out with that guy, and now he just wants to date me?¬†Do you think it would be crazy for me to want to have a label on our relationship? I do not want to act crazy or possessive since I do not want to push him away since I really really love him.

Sorry for the grammatical mistakes since English is my second language. Thanks!

1g6v3o3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCAS/comments/1g6v3o3/allergy_safe_portable_foods_low_histamine/,Allergy safe portable foods (+ low histamine?),"I'm a working college student, which means I do NOT have a lot of free time to do extensive cooking/food prep and I need portable food. I leave home at 7:30 or 8:30 in the morning and sometimes don't get back until 10 pm; the extra weight of carrying a lunchbox isn't ideal, but if it really is the only option I still need some foods that don't need to be refrigerated to get me through until I'm off work. My lunch box is always thoroughly warm by the time I'm through my shift at 7 or 8 pm.

So here's the problem: I have a lot of food allergies. They're not 'true' allergies (none show up on blood testing), but I didn't even know I had them until I did skin testing and reacted to 34/80 tested food allergen samples and not a single environmental. And the foods in question include some stuff that's REALLY hard to avoid.

I've prioritized avoiding pork and dairy since they're more severe than the others and just reducing my intake of the grains, but I'm trying to work towards entirely cutting out all of my known allergens from testing so I can do elimination diet-style testing and figure out any changes, identify other new allergens that may have cropped up, identify specific reactions, etc as well as generally feeling better. I haven't observed specific reactions to some of these allergens but for the vast majority I initially thought they were false positives, until I ate large enough amounts of them and had specific, noticable reactions that confirmed I do in fact have an allergy or intolerance. Dairy protein gives me horrid eczema especially on my face, pork causes very bad bloating and stomach pain, raspberries result in nasal passage swelling that causes breathing problems, etc.

This is all with zero regard to histamine content in food as well ‚Äî so my question is, does anyone have suggestions for food items or recipes that meet the points I need them to? Or that meet them AND are low histamine diet friendly? Bonus if they're cheap and don't taste like chalk, I'm poor.

I especially have been struggling to find high protein content foods since I'm trying to build muscle (I'm supposed to get minimum 60g protein a day, ideally more like 140g which is hands down not possible right now). Beans, lentils, chicken, and eggs are cool and all but beans and lentils tend to leak moisture from the containers I've tried + don't taste great cold, chicken is not safe to eat anymore by the end of a 15 hour day, and I can't eat nothing but boiled eggs for protein. Protein shakes have issues with spoilage (I often make protein shakes with straight pea protein powder, sugar or honey or allulose to taste, frozen fruit, and plant milk), and tofu is kind of weird and miserable to eat unflavored and unseasoned and I don't really know what to do with it that doesn't require like, stovetop cooking? I don't know if you can really meal prep fried tofu but eating too much oily/fried food doesn't make my stomach feel good either. Edamame has also had the same issue as the beans with moisture leakage.

I still haven't figured out the bread situation either. Sandwiches or wraps of some kind seem like the ideal portable food for lunches or breakfast but I have yet to find a bread recipe without rice, corn, wheat, or potatoes - most have multiple of them. I tried modifying a gluten free bread recipe that had the lowest reliance on allergens I'd found, and it came out far too crumbly to use for sandwiches (to be fair, I also don't have xanthan gum or agar but I replaced any starches/binders I didn't have with the ones I did, which in this case were an egg, more chia seeds than originally called for, and like a teaspoon of arrowroot starch I think? Or tapioca? Or maybe I gave up and put potato starch, don't remember).

Please offer any suggestions yall have!!!

List of allergies -
fruits and vegetables:
Apricot, banana, blueberry, cantaloupe/muskmelon, coconut, raspberry, lettuce, potatoes (both sweet and white specifically tested)

nuts and seeds:
All nuts (except almonds and cashews, specifically teated and did not react), sesame.

grains:
Barley, corn, rice, whole wheat

spices:
Cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla

seafood:
TL;DR on this was all seafood. There were a handful I didn't react to, both finned and shellfish, but I reacted to the ambiguous ""fish mix"". Not worth the risk esp when expensive and very perishable, except maybe salmon (specifically tested, did not react). 

misc:
Coffee, milk & milk protein (casein), pork",1,1729292345.0,MCAS,4,0.67,False

1g6uxps,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1g6uxps/i_feel_like_i_am_the_only_sane_one_in_my_family/,I feel like I am the only sane one in my family,"Or maybe I'm just the black sheep and I'm pretending I'm not? My mother, father, grandparents, siblings‚Äì They all just lived their lives, some even growing up or living with me for years, without thinking of me once, when I always considered them for everything. 

It feels weird and cringey to type out, let along say out loud, but I got the feeling again today. 

Just for an example: Whenever one of my family members would be having a rough time from mental illness, be it depression, anxiety, etc, I would always try to listen to them from a place of understanding and let them talk everything out. Then I would try to cheer them up. I know how to, I know these people. They tell me how much they appreciate it and there's all the warm cozy connection that happens after. 

But when it comes to me needing someone to lean on? Everyone is mysteriously silent. I talk and confide in them, but all they do is stay completely silent and not react, before bringing something else up entirely or even talking to someone else. I thought maybe I was reminding them of unpleasant things? Most of the things I talk about aren't very dire. And if things are, they just... Don't react to that, either. 

They react the same to whether I joke about making my coffee too sweet (or with sarcasm in that case) the same way they react to me talking about not having heat for the last week.

Just staying quiet for a pronounced amount of time, and then bringing something else up. And it's not like everything that leaves my mouth is a complaint, either. They only act like this when I try to speak seriously with them.

The fact that I would never do something like that to someone, lets me know that there are other people in the world who actually give a shit. I am not special. But... Why my own family? I'm either the only sane one or I'm insane because of how I feel over their collective behavior. They all do it. I don't know why. I feel like I'm being gaslit, as much as I hate how that word's being used. They all make me feel like I am the only person in the world who doesn't deserve to be seen or heard or comforted.

Someone who shares my anxiety of driving, who will apologize over and over for freaking out and is met with nothing but reassurance from me, seems to just brush off my own anxiety when I talk about it. That just happened today, and it hit me. So I felt the urge to make this post. 

It sucks. I always felt like I could never count on another person, while everyone around me would brag about how they were always there for me and all of that. But when it came to *being there* in any way that didn't involve mild physical labor that could be seen by others, it seems like they were all uninterested. It didn't get brought up, but favors would still be asked of me whether I was in a position to help or not. 

My head hurts. 

Thanks for reading this far. Just wanted to vent, I guess.
