1pv6zf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ChristianBFreeman/comments/1pv6zf6/when_real_is_enough/,When real is enough,"I asked the Lord—again—why He brought you into my life.

I’ve asked several times, actually. I’m persistent like that.

The answer never changes.

“You needed someone real to talk to.”

That was it. No thunder. No burning bush. Just the spiritual equivalent of a shrug.

Someone real, He explained. Someone who tells the hard truths. Someone who’s lived through the tough, the ugly, the beautiful, and still shows up with coffee and opinions. Someone who knows life doesn’t come with instructions, just warnings printed in very small font.

“But why,” I asked, “send me a beautiful young woman?”

The Lord didn’t even pause.

“Why not?”

Fair point. Annoyingly fair.

I told Him I wasn’t asking for anything in return. No grand expectations. No dramatic destiny. Just a conversation from time to time. Maybe a laugh. Maybe a moment where the world makes a little more sense. And the unspoken agreement that if things ever get heavy, neither of us has to carry it alone.

Why talk to you, you might ask?

Because you’re interesting.

Because you listen.

Because you’re real.

Because you’re raw.

And apparently, according to the Lord, that’s more than enough reason.",1,1766643581.0,u_ChristianBFreeman,0,1.0,False

1pv6yjq,https://i.redd.it/o4edk722ma9g1.png,Found Hubby's Love Nest—His Mistress Called Me MOM!,"I've closed billion-dollar deals without flinching.





But ""mom""? That word hit different.





Still married, and he's already got her meeting the family?





Something dark coiled in my gut. I smiled back.





""Hi.""





""Come in. I'm Jasmine.""





First thing I see—huge U.S. map covering the whole wall. Red strings everywhere, pinning photos of them kissing. Every pin marks a trip.





Dozens of them. Coast to coast.





She notices me staring. Smiles wider.





""It's our travel board. He takes me somewhere new every month.""





So this started way earlier than I thought.





She takes my coat like we're friends. Hangs it up real careful.





Hands me coffee—perfect temp.





I scan the place. Downtown prime real estate, 2,000 square feet, this finish level? Fifty mil easy.





""He bought this for you?""





Her cheeks flush. ""Yeah.""





""Lucas said it's my PhD gift.""





Ten years married. Never celebrated one holiday. Not one piece of real jewelry.





My birthday? Store-bought cake and a text.





I told myself love just settles. Gets comfortable.





Bullshit. Love doesn't settle. It just moves on.





She shifts on her feet. Finally works up the nerve.





""Ma'am... we're serious. Will you give us your blessing?""





Thought I was numb.





My chest still tightened. Words slipped out.





""How'd you meet?""





Jasmine lights up. And suddenly I remember—that night I was burning with fever. We were already loaded, but he bolted for some ten-grand deal.





Because she texted: ""Miss you.""





""Ma'am, when he first saw me, he said I lit up his whole world.""





""And he's so smart—scary smart. Fixed this massive tech problem for my dad's company. Took him one look.""





""So... will you say yes?""





Big hopeful eyes locked on mine.





I leaned back, lips curving.





""You know he's married, right?""





She blinks. Bites her lip.





""Lucas told me... he doesn't love her. It's just business. No real feelings.""





""He said she's older than his aunt. No personality. Turned herself into a guy. Her skin's disgusting.""





I rub my calloused palms—scars from hauling cheese sacks in the startup days.





Every night back then, he'd rub thick cream into my hands. Massage them till I fell asleep.





Called me the backbone of everything we built.





""Honestly, what man would want that?""





""Plus they're divorcing anyway. I don't mind waiting—long as he loves me.""





My hand freezes mid-air. Coffee cup trembling.





We met through friends. Love at first sight. Lucas told everyone I was his dream girl.





He swore he wouldn't marry me till he made it. We ran the cheese biz together—no sleep, no breaks. I went gray overnight. Looked fifty at thirty.





One night, drunk as hell, he dropped to his knees sobbing. Kept saying sorry.





So even when I had no time for salons, I dyed my hair religiously. For him.





The chaos in my chest goes still. Ice cold.





I came. I saw. I compared.





It's not about her being better.





He just stopped giving a damn.





If there's no love? Let's burn it all down.





Chapter 2





I was about to answer when Jasmine's phone rang. She put it on speaker.





Lucas's voice came through—low, smooth, tender. I'd never heard him sound like that.





""Baby, you hungry? Got your favorite lobster bisque. Be there in fifteen.""





I knew that place. Three-hour wait, clear across town.





Once when I was laid up with a busted ankle, craving something light, I mentioned it.





He was sitting by the bed peeling an apple. Didn't even look up.





Jasmine went full lovesick puppy, blowing kisses at the phone.





""Love you so much, babe!""





While they cooed at each other, I slipped into the bathroom.





Men's toiletries everywhere—more than we had at home.





I texted my assistant Emily. Told her to pull every goddamn transaction Lucas made in the last year.





He's burning my money on her? That bastard's gonna pay.





Just as I'm about to head out, Lucas's voice echoes from the hall.





""Look what else I got you.""





Jasmine squeals. ""The sapphire from yesterday!""





""I only looked at it once and you bought it!""





""Well, I've got a surprise for you too!""





She skips over, taps on the bathroom door all mysterious-like.





""Ma'am, you done in there?""





I shut off the faucet. Opened the door.





Jasmine bounces between us, arms flung wide.





""Perfect timing! Huge news—let's celebrate together.""





""Hubby gave me sapphires. I'm giving him a baby!""





My whole body locks up. I snap my head toward her.





After Luke was born, I wanted a daughter so bad.





He always had excuses. Turns out he just didn't want one with me.





Lucas is grinning—until his eyes slide past Jasmine and lock on mine.





His smile dies. Pupils shrink. Like I'm the one who crashed their little paradise.





""What the hell are you doing here?""





I walk back to my seat. Let my eyes drift between them.





My silence pisses him off.





He pulls Jasmine behind him.





""You got a problem? Take it up with me. Leave her out of it.""





Jasmine looks confused. Tugs his sleeve.





""Isn't she your mom?""





Lucas freezes. Then laughs—cold, mean.





""Sweet girl, your eyes aren't wrong. She does look old as hell.""





""But she's my wife.""





Jasmine's face cycles through shock, horror, realization. Hands fly to her mouth.





""Mrs. Winston... I—I didn't mean—""





""I'm so—""





She stammers, face turning red.





Lucas wraps an arm around her, glares at me.





""Don't apologize to her.""





""Chloe. Get out.""





Jasmine peeks out from his chest. Eyes me with a smug little glint.





I drain the last of my coffee. Grab my coat. Walk right up to her.





""Your request earlier? I agree.""





Elevator doors start closing. Lucas bolts out, jams his hand in to stop them.





He's staring at me—thrown off because I'm not yelling. There's panic in his eyes. Just a flicker.





""Chloe, this is... it's complicated.""





""You know pregnant women can't handle stress.""





""Divorce would wreck us financially. She's not a threat to you.""





Lucas knows I treat the business like my kid. Divorce means splitting everything.





He's threatening me.





I know he won't let go till I respond.





I hum softly. Wave him off.





Lucas relaxes.





Suddenly a trash bag lands at my feet.





""Take this down on your way out.""





The second the doors start closing, I kick it back out.





Does this asshole really think I walked in here unprepared?





Chapter 3





I drove back to the office. Pulled out the divorce papers I'd been sitting on.





Truth is, I drafted them the first time I caught him messing around.





Love just took a little longer to die than trust.





Back then, Lucas sliced himself open—literally—swearing on his blood it'd never happen again.





I stood there staring at the puddle spreading across the floor, my barely-showing belly, our startup just taking off. Made the ""rational"" choice. Let it slide.





""Mrs. Winston, they're here."" Emily knocked.





After some back-and-forth, I sold every share I owned.





Yeah, the factory was my baby. But once something's rotted through? Not worth keeping.





I only wanted one thing—my kid.





My phone alarm went off. Time to pick Luke up from preschool.





Except Lucas beat me there.





Jasmine was crouched next to my son, holding up some massive Ultraman cotton candy.





Luke's face lit up in a way I'd never seen.





""Who do you like more, sweetie—me or Mommy?"" Jasmine's voice dripped sugar.





Luke giggled, poked her dimple.





""How about I become your mommy? And give you a baby brother to play with?""





My son nodded hard. Stood on his tiptoes to kiss her cheek.





Lucas scooped Luke up with one arm, took Jasmine's hand with the other. Walked them across the street.





He saw my car. Eyes flicked to the driver's seat.





Paused on my face for half a second.





Then got in his car with them.





I sat there, brain buzzing static. AC blasting my face red.





Took forever to snap out of it.





Lucas wanted me to see that.





Ever since Luke started preschool, he'd been dodging my hugs.





I thought it was because I was too strict. Now I know better.





Turns out the ""perfect family"" I thought we had? Just my own delusion.





Too bad Lucas miscalculated. Thought I'd keep swallowing this shit for Luke's sake.





Nobody—nobody—is stopping me from walking out.





Got home. Luke was playing with the remote-control car Jasmine gave him.





Lucas came up behind me like nothing happened. Wrapped his arms around my waist.





""You wanted a daughter, right?""





""I'll give you one tonight.""





His guilty little peace offering made my skin crawl.





I shoved him off.





""Save it for Jasmine.""





Lucas thought I was still pissed. Started pawing at me harder, trying to get a rise.





Our old routine—fight, fuck, forget.





Not this time.





He grabbed the back of my neck. Shoved me forward.





Got too close—the cheese smell baked into my skin made him turn his head on reflex.





The more I fought, the harder he gripped.





BANG.





My head slammed into the wall.





Everything spun. He grabbed the back of my skull instinctively.





His phone rang.





Few seconds later, he let go. Face went cold.





""Fine. Your choice. Saves me from popping pills just to get it up for you.""





Didn't need to guess who called.





Lucas changed shirts, doused himself in cologne. Threw one last line over his shoulder on his way out.





""Enough drama. Don't forget to prep the cash for next week's company party.""





Every year he loved playing big shot—handing out year-end bonuses in cash.





Half the time he miscounted. Caused all kinds of employee drama.





One year I got mugged on the way to pick up the money. Ended up in the ER.





Now he's burned through the company accounts on Jasmine.





Where the hell's he gonna get the cash to save face?

He invited me to a party months ago and when I went I thought he was really cute when he was drunk and I just really wanted to talk to him and impress him I guess?

•doing a sunrise/sunset walk

• grabbing a coffee or lunch

1pv6uyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1pv6uyl/switched_from_tea_to_coffee_last_year_need/,Switched from tea to coffee last year — need guidance to start with ground coffee,"Hello,

So last year I slowly shifted from being a daily tea drinker to coffee. Initially it was very basic — Nescafé with milk, those ₹2 sachets. It felt nice and did the job. Then I tried Bru and honestly… it tasted way better than Nescafé to me (again with milk).

Out of curiosity, I tried black coffee with Bru, and surprisingly I liked it. That’s when things started getting interesting.

The real game changer for me was Davidoff Espresso 57. I tried it black and it was hands down the best black coffee I’ve ever had. After that, everyone I spoke to told me the same thing: once you start drinking ground coffee, instant coffee will feel terrible.

Now here’s where I’m stuck.

From what I understand, making black coffee with ground coffee takes more time and effort. I work in an office, so I can’t really do long brewing processes there. Still, I really want to try ground coffee at home at least.

When I started looking into it, I got confused :
	•	Too many brewing methods
	•	Too much equipment
	•	Too many types of coffee and roasts

From whatever I’ve read so far, French press seems like the easiest and most beginner-friendly option — but I honestly have no real idea how it works, what coffee to buy, grind size, brands, etc.

So I wanted to ask this sub:
	•	Where should I start as someone coming from instant coffee?
	•	Is French press actually a good first step?
	•	Any beginner-friendly ground coffee recommendations (especially for black coffee)?
	•	How did you start your coffee journey?

Any advice, suggestions, or even mistakes to avoid would be super helpful. Thanks in advance! 🙏",1,1766643099.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False
1pv6tes,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pv6tes,Capri's Davao: A perfect example of how a restaurant should handle complaints and compared to Basilico (4/5),"Ate at Capri's with my GF and the place is absolutely beautiful. Not only does the space look great, it smells great and as soon as we walked in we had such great service from the host and our waitress.

The free bread was okay but we didn't finish it as we wanted to order a lot. Our appetiser was the Salpicao. This one was well balanced with the perfectly acidic and well seasoned tomato and the peppery watercress to balance the richness of their ranch and the bread it was on was thick enough to hold everything in without being too thick or toasted too hot that it would be too hard but overall it was something we could've avoided ordering and out experience wouldn't have changed much. 3/5

We also ordered drinks, my GF ordered a coffee and I ordered a mocktail. These two came out great and the mocktail was so fresh. 5/5

So here are where things take a turn. We noticed that our pizza was done but they held it at the pass so that we could get all dishes at once. I brought this up with our waitress and they had the pizza reheated. I like the flavor of the dough, it's really clear that they let the dough proof and rest so that there is the yeasty flavor that really shines. The toast of the pizza is less prominent compared to Basilico though. I prefer the pizza at Basilico for its texture but taste wise Capri takes it. 3.7/5 (If Capri can get the texture and toast better it'd definitely be a 4/5 because their ingredients are definitely top quality.

Capri salad had some pieces of chicken that were dry but overall the lettuce was so fresh and it had the perfect amount of dressing that the salad wasn't drenched in dressing but enough to coat each leaf giving it a beautiful flavor. 4.2/5

The Pork chop was very unfortunate. It was overcooked on one side and had absolutely no color on the other side. I raised this to our waitress and she came back asking us if we wanted to get another side or another try of the pork chop while heartily apologizing on behalf of the chef for the cook of the porkchop. I appreciated this gesture but politely asked if they could just mark it off the bill which they agreed. The dish itself was 2/5 for the cook, but if it was perfect it wouldve been a solid 4/5 as well. Service made it 5/5 though.

Our last dish was the panna cotta. The texture was perfect and though the strawberries were more tart than sweet it actually worked to the benefit of the dish. 4.3/5

  
Additional Note:  
I will always celebrate great service and this is what we got at Capri's. I really felt the genuine care of when the porkchop wasn't cooked well and I don't usually get that at other restaurants where the service staff don't actually know what to do in those situations.

IMHO, When we go to restaurants and can spend up to 4x the minimum daily wage of the average Filipino, we deserve quality and attention to detail. I'm really fortunate to be able to afford these meals and my heart goes out to those who really save up to have a good experience with their loved ones and they deserve consistency and care.

I work 16hrs between 2 jobs so 80 hours total in a week. I can say honestly I be drained like a zombie when I get off work . I work 2pm-10pm then 10:30-6:30am.

I get off work and go home get in bed thinking everything is fine . I Get woken up out my sleep around 7:40am  to a yelling screaming girlfriend because her car wouldn’t start and she wanted to go get coffee before work. We live in Michigan so the beginning of the winters hit our cars hard. The cold kills the battery & most times it’s just time for a new battery.

Anyways she’s yelling screaming waking me up saying she’s about have a panic attack Just doing the most!! (She could have just took my car, we have multiple cars)

I eventually get up in rage not understanding why she’s acting like this over something so simple. We start arguing I tell her stop bitching…

She runs over to me face to face and ask me who I’m calling a bitch while taking her index finger and shoving it right in my eye(she said not intentional, but by pure accident) she cut my eye lid open inches from my eye ball. I was bleeding pretty bad. She kept apologizing saying she didn’t mean to hurt me .

Not directed to anyone in particular. Just floating in the air, and somehow landing on me. Like I’m part of the machine.

At my previous job, whenever a few other female coworkers were out, the responsibility of making coffee would quietly shift onto me. The strange part is, I don’t even drink coffee. I don’t know how to make it well. Yet people would stand near the machine, waiting, as if my presence alone meant I was supposed to handle it. I remember feeling confused and uncomfortable, wondering when this became my role.

Once, a coworker patiently showed me how to brew coffee “properly,” explaining that it would make things easier for everyone in the future. He wasn’t trying to be rude, but that was the moment it clicked. I never volunteered for this role. I wasn’t good at it. I didn’t enjoy it. I was just absorbed into it because that’s how things had been running.

Eventually, they stopped asking altogether. My coffee was often too weak or too strong, and I rarely drank it myself. Still, the expectation lingered. When I didn’t move right away, the room would go quiet in that awkward way, like I’d failed an unspoken test. Coffee turned into a measure of cooperation, of whether I was “easy to work with,” of whether I fit in.

What bothered me most was realizing how many small, unofficial tasks work like this. No one assigns them, but someone always ends up carrying them. Over time, they blur your boundaries and make you forget that opting out is even possible.

I don’t mind helping. I don’t hate coffee. I just hate being assumed. I hate being placed into a role without choice. A workplace feels much lighter when people who want coffee simply make it themselves, instead of calling someone’s name and expecting her to step in.",2,1766642048.0,TheBigGirlDiary,0,1.0,False

My friend always adjusts to her girlfriend’s preferences (beach, camping, nature trips), but when my friend wants simple dates like going to the mall, parks, games, or coffee things that make her inner child happy her girlfriend refuses, saying it’s tiring or not her thing.

I told my friend that if she’s constantly hurting or they’re no longer aligned, they should seriously talk about it or reconsider the relationship. But at the same time, I know it’s not really my place to interfere. It’s just painful to watch someone you care about suffer every day.

They don’t ask to be important.

They don’t warn you that they’ll stay.

That day was like that.

It began with small things; coffee, mostly.

At Roastary.

Too crowded now, you said. You don’t really go there anymore.

We waited outside for a bit, an awkward start but soon enough I was so absorbed in talking to you that I missed our turn in the queue entirely. By the time I realised, we were already late going in. I didn’t mind. I don’t think you did either.

I chose the indoor seating. A mistake, maybe. It was loud. I think now I would’ve picked outdoors. There was also a small fumble on my part, I should’ve offered you the chair first. I didn’t. Not because I didn’t care, but because I already felt strangely at ease around you, as if formalities had quietly stepped aside.

We ordered our first coffee, something new. New for me.

And then I noticed it, the way you placed a tissue under your glass so the table wouldn’t get wet. A gesture so ordinary it could’ve gone unnoticed. Except it didn’t. It told me something about you before I realised I was listening.

I kept the bill.

I still don’t know why.

Maybe I wanted proof the day wasn’t imagined.

There’s no picture from that day.

Only memory, doing its imperfect work.

We talked, and then we walked.

No destination in mind. Just movement. Just time stretching gently instead of rushing past us.

While we walked, you mentioned a Casio AQ240, how you wanted to try it on before deciding. I liked that about you. The patience in wanting to feel something before claiming it. I liked that you carried treats for cats. I liked that you loved animals. I do too.

We wandered again.

We found a spot by the lake at Rabindra Sarobar, letting the silence sit with us instead of filling it. You didn’t seem afraid of quiet. Neither was I; though at first I kept wondering what else to say, before realising you were perfectly content just being there.

Later you took me to Evabrew. Your go to cafe you said, between lavender coffee and banana chocolate cake, you recommended I watch Life of Chuck.

We shared a silence, broken only by my smile, an awkward realisation of the million tiny chances that had put me right there, that day, with you. I remember details I didn’t know I’d keep, the purple sweater, maroon lipstick, the way you placed your glasses down on the table, how you brushed your hair behind your ear when you listened. Your smile felt gentle, unguarded, your laugh effortless, something I didn’t want to interrupt. You showed me your knitted Mobius shawl, talked about your crafts. I don’t know if I said it clearly then, but you have so much talent. I remember you saying you wanted to have your own cafe someday or at least a good coffee machine of your own.

There was kindness in you that didn’t feel performative. Thoughtfulness that didn’t announce itself.

You spoke about books, art, anime, music, travel; not like interests on a list, but like things that had quietly shaped you.

Then we walked again while waiting for your auto. None came. And I remember thinking how lucky I was to get a little more time with you, just walking. Eventually the goodbye arrived, awkward as goodbyes often are when neither person wants the day to end. I know I didn’t.

I walked away knowing something had shifted, even if nothing had been promised.

I know it was only one date, and we barely spoke after. But that one day carried the weight of knowing someone for a long time, maybe even a lifetime.

Since then, I’ve realised I wasn’t only remembering you.

I was remembering a version of myself I hadn’t felt in a long time; alive, hopeful, motivated, open. Capable of joy again.

I wanted to share things I hadn’t shared with anyone. Not because I planned to, but because it felt safe. And afterward, something curious happened. I wanted more from myself. I wanted to work harder, learn instruments, read more, sing badly, live more honestly.

You felt like a dopamine rush, yes. But also like a mirror, showing me a version of myself I’d forgotten I could be.

If science were to explain it, it might say my nervous system recognized safety, novelty, and resonance all at once. That combination can feel spiritual. It can feel intoxicating. It can feel destabilising.

There’s a name for it. Limerence mixed with genuine connection. That doesn’t mean it wasn’t real.

It just means my emotions ran ahead while reality paused.

I don’t know where paths go when they diverge like this. I only know that crossing yours mattered to me.

That some meetings don’t turn into stories, but they still change the reader.

If our paths cross again someday, I’d welcome it.

And if they don’t, I’m still grateful we crossed at all.

Because for a while, walking beside you, the world felt a little quieter and I felt more myself than I had in a long time.

For a brief moment, I even wanted to believe in something larger than myself some quiet force that might look down and say, just this once, let him have what he wants. I’m an atheist. But hope has a way of borrowing language wherever it can.

That day you asked me if I wanted to write. I had said yes. That was true. I just never had the motivation before. Maybe it was you.

**Prologue**

This post is just me sharing an experience that feels very unique to me. It might be normal for others, but I know I’ll never forget this night in my life.

It is not very overwhelming either, just plain and simple but very very unexpected particularly in my case.

In my 26 years of life, I’ve never been in a relationship. Crushes? Yes. But nothing beyond that, because I never had the courage to approach them and express how I felt. I’m not an expressive person in general, and only i know how many opportunities i lost because of this trait, be it career, life or anything.

I’m so timid that I didn’t even have many female friends, except for one girl I became friends with in my final year of college but that friendship didn’t last long. That's another story.

**Actual story**

But something different happened exactly three years ago, christmas night 2022.
Me and two of my friends went to Garage moto cafe which hosted a stand up comedy night, by Ashok Khatri and team.

The show started, the artists were killing it but the crowd were very less, like 10-15 people only. We were seated in the last row and Ashok bhai asked us to occupy the front row, for obvious reasons.

The show went on for an hour or so, and out of habit i looked over my shoulders. I was gobsmacked by what i've seen. It was the most beautiful girl i've ever seen in my entire life and i froze for a second before taking another look. I snuck in 2-3 more glances but i felt that it might feel creepy to her, so i stopped.

The show ended after 30mins. And the situation was like, the crowd were less and they are supposed to start the 2nd show of the night. So Ashok bhai asked us to stay for that second show too, no tickets needed. Me and my friends were in.

I looked back again after he asked us to stay and the girl was getting ready to leave, my heart sank. I wished so hard that she could stay, just the thought of her leaving felt very painful to me. And it became a reality.

She stood up and started walking to the counter to pay for her coffee/tea whatever. It felt like my life was being pulled away. I felt like this was my only chance and she was the only one made for me. Yeah it is cringe, i feel it too, but thats how it felt to me at the time.

So for the first and the last time in my life, I picked up the courage. I stood up and walked to the counter to ""buy"" something. My heart was pounding as if it could burst.

With a shaky voice i said ""Hi"", She smiled at me and said Hi back. I was almost sweating. I asked for her name, she said it and i don't know if she asked mine or not, i told mine too while smiling like an idiot.

Then i said, "" Can you stay too? The show is pretty good right? and they need some people to keep the show going"" 

But she refused, She was waiting for another friend and came to the show to kill some time. 
I was disappointed and said ""Oh"". All the courage that i built up collapsed to the basement in a second.

She paid the bill and started walking to the door, I turned towards to her to say my final goodbye, She too said it and she was gone, along with all my courage.

One of the biggest what ifs in my life. What if i had grown more courage and the outcome would have been different or maybe change my life?

I somehow still feel like creep for bothering her but my intentions were pure. And there will not be another such experience my life.

1pv682b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pv682b/how_do_you_live_with_an_emotionally_avoidant/,How do you live with an emotionally avoidant spouse without losing yourself?,"I’ve been married for over 5+ years, and it has been a roller-coaster ride. In the beginning, I truly believed this was a new start and that things would improve with time. I kept letting things go. My spouse’s family believes in brushing everything under the carpet in the name of ""family unity"". There is no accountability, no resolution, only silence and the normalization of harm.

My husband is emotionally avoidant. He withdraws, shuts down, and punishes through silent treatment. Loud voices, emotional expression, conflict, sadness, and even a simple change in tone completely overwhelm his nervous system. He walks away, disappears, becomes defensive, refuses to accept responsibility, and disconnects. This happens only when my emotions are involved. With the rest of the world, he functions perfectly fine.

I married believing that in our highs and lows, we would be there for each other. Instead, when there is family drama, I am isolated. When there is marital conflict, my husband avoids me, yet he remains emotionally available, calm, and fully functional for everyone else.

He is a good, involved father, but emotionally, he is a deeply absent spouse.

When it comes to emotional connection, repair, or intimacy, he is unavailable. His emotional world feels hidden and extremely hard to read. I often cannot tell whether he genuinely feels things deeply or simply performs ""being nice"" on the surface. It feels like he is capable of care in roles, but not capable of emotional attachment in partnership. I genuinely believe he would rather emotionally let someone go than feel vulnerable enough to love deeply, because protecting his mental state seems to come before emotional connection.

When we argue, and I say something not nice in the heat of pain, **I am always the one who comes back, apologizes, and tries to mend things,** not because the issue was resolved, but because I want the house to feel safe, loving, and emotionally stable for our children. Once I do this, he becomes ""normal"" again, and life continues,s yet the issues are never actually repaired. He does not make an effort to mend anything. He prefers emotional distance and being alone. I do this so the kids are not impacted, even while my heart is still hurting.

We have three young children, all on the spectrum. Our home already requires extra emotional stability, patience, and nurturing, yet I am the only one consistently providing that emotional glue.

Over the years, I noticed a painful pattern:  
**If I suppress my feelings and keep everything ""normal"", he becomes present. The moment I express sadness, hurt, or emotional need, he withdraws again.** His presence is conditional. My emotional silence keeps the marriage ""working.""

I also realize something about myself. I was looking for love, care, emotional safety, and partnership, and I believed my spouse would give that to me. I became emotionally attached, emotionally invested, emotionally present. He became emotionally avoidant.

I kept giving emotionally, physically, morally, and financially. I kept showing up. All I asked for in return was some ""us time"", some warmth, some love, some care, and emotional presence. Instead, I received emotional distance.

He expects married life to be a fairy tale where no negative emotions are allowed. I am expected to always speak gently, stay pleasant, and avoid ""heavy"" conversations. My emotional world is not welcome. My feelings are treated as disruptions.

He only engages deeply on topics he prefers, mainly finances and planning. When I try to talk about emotions or our relationship, he shuts it down.

His version of ""spending time"" is extremely limited, mostly physical intimacy or watching TV shows he chooses (or ones we both like, but never mine). He believes this counts as a connection. There is no emotional closeness, no nurturing, no checking in, no ""How was your day?"" No apologies. No interest in dates, coffee time, eating out, or shared experiences. No hand-holding. No reassurance. No emotional repair. He only becomes present when he needs something. Very headstrong!

We went to therapy, hoping for healing. Instead, the last therapist validated his emotional avoidance and instructed him to communicate only through short, scheduled ""meeting invites"" no more than 30 minutes, limited to logistics like kids, finances, and planning. Our marriage now literally runs on calendar meetings instead of human connection. He now attends only individual sessions with the same therapist who didn't help resolve, instead made it worse, and I've stopped couples therapy altogether. He goes out alone to the restaurants, spends time with the kids, and has stopped sharing his life with me. He does not tell me his plans. He was always secretive, but this has become extreme, especially after I had a major nervous breakdown and lost my self-respect chasing him after an argument.

This has led me to ask deeper questions:

• How does an emotionally avoidant person’s nervous system actually work?  
• Why do they shut down only with their partner but function normally with the rest of the world?  
• Are they neurodivergent, emotionally absent, narcissistic, or simply unable to emotionally attach and love deeply?  
• Is marrying someone like this a red flag and a huge mistake that slowly destroys the emotionally attached partner?  
• Do their brains operate on convenience and one-sided comfort rather than mutual connection?  
• Will they ever truly realize what they are doing?

There is no emotional safety here. No warmth. No repair. No true partnership.

I am emotionally exhausted. I feel unseen, unheard, and slowly erased. This does not feel like a marriage it feels like emotional disengagement structured into a system that protects one nervous system while destroying the other.

And I am finally questioning whether this can even change or whether I have spent years trying to emotionally connect with someone who is unequipped to connect in a relationship.",1,1766640619.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I stopped a couple of times for coffee/snacks/restroom, and then, at a Service Plaza on the Pennsylvania Turnpike, I pulled up to the fuel pumps and filled the truck full.  After the gas handle released, I squeezed it again to top it off.  Then I pulled it from the truck, closed the fuel door, and got in.  I often hit the door lock button before I drive off, but this time it didn't do anything.  I got back out and made sure I had the fuel door and all of the cab doors completely closed.  Still, neither the door buttons, key fob or app would lock the doors.  And if I manually pushed the lock button down, it wasn't going to unlock without pulling the handle from the inside.

I called Ram Support from the button in the cab at my next stop, but they were no help due to the holiday and said someone would get back to me in a couple of days.  I was nervous leaving the truck unattended with the doors unlocked as I travel with two laptops and other electronics.  Fortunately, no items were taken.

Then I pull off of I70 in Indiana and fill up again.  Right as I was done filling up, I remembered that this had all happened right after I fueled up my truck the last time.  So I pressed the lock button on my remote again.  And the door locks were working!  They've been working since.  I've got to wonder if something in the capless fuel system got tweaked, perhaps in my topping it off, that somehow affected the door locks until the next fuel-up.

1pv625k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pv625k,New bunny chilling with her new friends,"New bunny (who’s either going to be Holly Noelle or Gabriella/Gabby Noelle) is settling in and having a pajama party with some of her new friends. Legion (last photo) seems to have slightly misunderstood the assignment to “relax” and busted out his Hawaiian shirt instead for his PJ’s, but they decided to let him stay at the sleepover anyway.

My thoughts on new bunny, who is actually my very first brand new (rather than new to me but secondhand) BAB:

- The Sweetheart’s Darling bunny is *way* cuter in person. The stock photos on the website do her a disservice. While she has a round torso and face, she has very long ears and limbs that make her look much less chunky than on the website, and much easier to dress than she looks. She’s incredibly soft, and the texture of her ears and feet is fun.
-I like the BAB coffee scent, as artificial coffee scents go. I’m not sure how I feel about having a scented stuffed animal. I can’t decide if I wish I’d gotten two scent inserts for her or zero, but I know one wasn’t the right number. If I can get my hands on a second coffee scented insert without buying a whole other brand new BAB, I might try sticking a second one in and seeing if that makes matters better or worse.
-I like the beating BAB heart, but it only beats a couple of times before stopping. I think when new bunny’s had a bit more time to settle in, I may (*covers bunny’s ears before proceeding*) do a little home surgery and insert one of the beating hearts meant for stuffed animals left with puppies/kittens that can be left on a longer timer. Or I may try it with one of the BABs I need to restuff at some point anyway, then move on to bunny surgery if I like the results.
-Her head, body and lower limbs have what I consider a good amount of stuffing- not too much, not too little. They somehow managed to not stuff her arms at all. One more reason for some (*covers the long ears one more time*) surgery later!

Overall, I am very happy with her and am glad I got her, but am not sure I’d do the extras (beating heart and scent) again, and might order her unstuffed if I had it to do over again even though she was an online exclusive, and either stuffed her myself or taken her to the store.",18,1766640004.0,buildabear,5,1.0,False

One thing I can say is that a great boss makes ALL the difference. A great boss can make bad days into good ones and the mark of any great boss is the vibe of the employees.

I’ve been a customer of Dutch Bros since they opened their first location in Auburn at Dry Creek and 49. As a matter of fact, the very first outside food I had in the hospital after my son was born was a large Cocomo blended freeze and it was ahhhhhhhmazing!  🥰

Today, I was fortunate to pick up some hours where I work and I decided to treat myself to a peppermint white mocha on my way in. As I pulled up to the line, a lady with a big smile and an aura of kindness was giving a hug to the employee with the ordering iPad.

I figured it was probably a relative, like a mom or an aunt, but came to find out that was the owner, Heather Mauel. The employee talked about what a great boss she is and how much fun the team is that she works with.

Every time I have been to any Dutch Bros locally, that is one of my favorite consistencies: the vibe.

Their job is not an easy one, standing an entire shift, small confined space, hustling in the hot sunshine or cold rain. But every time, they are welcoming, kind, attentive and fun to talk to.

And every great team has a great leader. My favorite bosses have always been the ones with the big hearts, genuine empathy and confident assertiveness that lets me know when I’m on the right path.

To Heather, I don’t know you, but you must be a pretty amazing person to consistently be such a badass leader to so many young folks in our community. I’ll be rooting for your continued success in giving so many of our kids a positive, living wage job in fun environments all over Placer County.

Hello everyone new to this group and was hoping for some advice and encouragement. My bf (33) and I (33) have been together for 5 years, about a month ago I discovered early on he was talking to another woman, went on a coffee date, and kissed. My whole world imploded and utter chaos ensued our home. In a desperate attempt to make sense of everything and salvage our relationship he immediately reached out to professional help and was diagnosed with BP2. 

*Before I begin, I know BP does not make people cheat. He was remorseful and took full accountability. Did not try to blame his actions on BP. He made these choices willingly. 

Our relationship was incredibly loving, he was the best boyfriend, literally the man of my dreams. Strong sene of values and self, raised by women, he was the golden retriever to my black cat. I did notice he was not the best at self regulating but it all seemed manageable until his father passed a few years ago. I believe this was the catalyst. I became his enemy, emotionally punching bag, and caregiver. Especially around the anniversary of his father’s passing (beginning of fall) is when he’s at his lowest. Emotional outburst, self loathing, screaming/crying, a minefield of triggers, the hypomania seems to last for weeks or longer. I always held on for dear life knowing my best friend is somewhere in there, I just have to wait it out and support. 

In a fucked up way, I feel a tremendous amount of  relief that something finally happened to make him take his mental health serious and get very much needed answers but I just never imagined like this. We have our own individual therapists. He’s been with his for a year on and off, but he started going steadily since discovery day. She helped him reach out to a psychiatrist and will start medication in a week or so. He is sober now from alcohol, unprescribed meds, and no more porn. Were hoping to start couples therapy in January if he continues to show consistency and transparency. 

I guess my dilemma

1) he reassures me that healing/supporting me through my betrayal trauma will always be parallel to his own healing journey but I can already feel myself deep diving into DP research and losing myself as someone who often falls into a caregiver role. How does one not make themselves “small” out of fear of triggering hypomania? I fear repairing our relationship will be incredibly triggering but I’m trying my best to advocate for myself in the healthiest way possible 

2) learning about hypomania makes me really weary of our future especially when it comes to being inclined to secrecy and risky behavior.. I decided to give him time to prove he’s committed to change only because I truly believe in my gut he is a good man with an immense amount of childhood trauma to work on. Even though he’s eager to do the work, the possibility of him switching on me and cheating again hovers over me. Am I foolish for being so compassionate and understanding? Did uncheck BP play any role to his infidelity? Would really appreciate to hear from y’all’s experiences ty for reading

I've been lurking here for a while and figured it's time to actually meet some of you in person. No agenda, no networking pitch - just grabbing coffee/chai and chatting about life in this part of Bangalore.

**About me:** Software engineer, recently moved back to working from this side of town. Into tech, classical music, and figuring out how to navigate Bangalore traffic without losing my mind. Pretty regular guy looking to make some local friends.

**The plan:**

* **When:** This Saturday or Sunday afternoon (flexible on timing)
* **Where:** Somewhere central in Yelahanka - open to suggestions (coffee shop, park, wherever)
* **Who:** Anyone who wants to show up. All ages, all backgrounds welcome
* **Vibe:** Casual hangout, zero pressure

If 3-4 people are interested, we'll pick a spot and time. Drop a comment or DM if you're in.

Looking forward to meeting some of you!",1,1766638776.0,yelahanka,4,1.0,False

We had our first coffee date after rescheduling. For context, shes in the military and also in the process of moving. It was awkward but in the best way possible. We just talked and laughed for 2 hours. Once I got home from the date I messaged her telling her how much of a great time I had and that id love to take her out on a proper date once things settle down for her. She says shed love too. We talked more than we ever have the next few days. A day after those she left me on read which wasnt a bjg deal. Another day goes by with nothing and I message her again saying I know things were hectic for her and that Id love to take her out. Just trying to show interest in meeting again. She responds immediately venting about the move but ends with saying she still wants to go on an actual date. I reply and the next day, radio silence and an eventual unadd on snapchat.

The biggest thing I remember is that he always started his videos with a catchphrase, something like:

“The coffee is hot, and the robot is very ___”

(I may not have the exact wording right, but it definitely started with “The coffee is hot…” as a recurring intro line.)

Other details I remember:
	•	He once reviewed LEGO Exo-Force 7705 Gate Assault
	•	I also remember a review of LEGO Batman 7783 — The Batcave: The Penguin and Mr. Freeze’s Invasion
	•	I believe he was an older man, friendly personality, kind of cozy / low-key vibe
	•	I think the videos may have been filmed in a dimmer room with colored lights in the background
	•	The channel was probably small-to-mid size, not one of the big well-known reviewers (like JANGbricks, etc.)

Someone else on Reddit remembered a very similar intro (“the coffee is hot and the robot is dancing”), so I’m guessing this might be the same person — but nobody in that old thread was able to identify him.

If this rings a bell for anyone — channel name, real name, video mirror, archive link, anything — I’d really appreciate the help. This one’s been stuck in my brain for years. Thanks!",1,1766638554.0,HelpMeFind,2,1.0,False

Chapter 1 

“Ms. Rhodes, this is Dignitas calling. Did you personally apply for cuthanasia on December 25th?” 

Sylvia Rhodes’s eyelashes fluttered slightly, but her voice remained calm. “Yes.” 

“Very well. Your application has been approved. You have two weeks to put your affairs in order.” 

Just after Sylvia hung up, the bedroom door opened. 

Her husband, Adrien Farrell, entered, letting in a sharp gust of cold air. Upon seeing her, he smiled and raised a deli- cately wrapped gift. “Syl, happy birthday.” 

Sylvia smiled softly. “My birthday was yesterday.” 

Adrien froze. A flicker of panic and embarrassment crossed his face. 

“Sorry, I’ve been too busy with work lately.” 

He squatted down and gently massaged her calves, changing the subject. “How are you feeling today? Any discom- fort in your legs*?*” 

He pressed too hard, his slender hands turning red. Veins stood out on the backs of his hands, a striking sight. 

**His** skill was undeniable, but Sylvia felt nothing. 

When she didn’t respond, Adrien looked up to ask, but his phone suddenly chirped in his pocket. 

He pulled it out and glanced at the screen. The moment he saw the name, a smile spread across his face. 

Whatever he’d been about to say was forgotten. He stood up abruptly. 

“Syl, I need to handle something for work. I’ll come back to massage you later.” Then he headed to the study. 

Sylvia stayed silent, watching him leave. 

Even after he was gone, his genuine, irrepressible smile replayed in her mind. 

He’d smile wholeheartedly over work? 

It must have been about someone he liked. 

After all, she’d seen him smile like that many times before.. 

Every morning in high school, she’d hurriedly finish her milk and rush downstairs, and there he’d be, smiling just like that. He’d walk over, take her heavy backpack, and take her to school on his bike.

Everything should have ended perfectly there. 

But something unexpected happened, 

Just one day before school began, they were in a car crash. When the car was about the hit them**,** Sylvia pushed Adrien out of the way. 

He walked away unharmed, but she was left paralyzed from the waist down. 

Misfortune never comes alone. That same year, Sylvia’s parents died in a plane crash. She buckled under the weig of the blows and fell into a deep depression. 

Adrien was heartbroken. Right after graduation, he proposed. 

He vowed he’d never let her down. 

He had kept his word throughout their three–year marriage. 

But the truth was exposed two weeks ago when Sylvia found his diary. 

The man who declared his love every day had been pouring out his pain in that diary. 

He wrote that he’d proposed out of a sense of duty, fearing that otherwise, everyone would blame him. 

He added that every time he came home, the heavy, suffocating feeling made it hard to breathe, every second he spent with her was a new form of torture. 

He noted that if he could have a second chance, he would have chosen the wheelchair. To him, the physical **suffering** was a far lighter weight than the crushing guilt of her sacrifice. 

He admitted that he’d fallen for another girl, Kiersten Tresham. She was vibrant, bright, and lively, just like Sylvía had been before the crash. 

The next day, Sylvia got several messages from Kiersten. 

“Sylvía, Adrien told me you’ll never walk again. You’ve known each other for so many years. Can’t you just let him go?” 

“Do you realize he’s been trapped in a living hell because of you? He wishes he were dead. But he can’t because he has to put on a brave face and take care of you. How miserable.” 

“If he hadn’t met me, he might’ve lost his mind. Don’t you feel guilty at all? I feel terrible for **him.** Besides, he loves

me now. So, please let him go, so we can be together.” 

Immediately after, Kiersten sent a dozen photos of herself with Adrien. 

Smiling as he brewed coffee, he noticed Kiersten taking a selfie, leaned in, and posed playfully for the camera. 

He peeled a whole plate of shrimp for Kiersten and wiped sauce from her fingers. 

He followed her footprints on the beach, then brought her a handful **of** seashells, a beaming smile on his face. 

By the time she finished looking at all the photos, Sylvia’s heart hurt so badly she could barely breathe**.** It felt like it was shattering. 

But her eyes had run dry of tears, a hollow emptiness staring back from them. 

She didn’t reply, but Kiersten didn’t stop. 

Every day after, Kiersten sent new photos, each stamped with a date. 

On November 21st, Adrien and Kiersten walked together in the park as the sun set. 

On November 26th, they went to a pottery studio and made a vase together. 

On December 1st, they attended a concert, talking about music and their future. 

The photos of them kept coming… 

Each timestamp was a silent contradiction to Adrien’s claims of working late. 

Even on her birthday yesterday, Sylvia waited all day and night for him. 

But he never came back because he was enjoying fireworks with Kiersten. 

Looking at those photos, Sylvia smiled bitterly until tears spilled out. 

Back when they were both 17 years old, Adrien had loved Sylvia with all his heart. 

Now that they were 25, he didn’t love her anymore. 

That night, Sylvia sat by the window all night. The following day, she submitted all the necessary documents to an overseas euthanasia organization, resolved to end her life.

Whatever he’d been about to say was forgotten. He stood up abruptly. 

“Syl, I need to handle something for work. I’ll come back to massage you later.” Then he headed to the study. 

Sylvia stayed silent, watching him leave. 

Even after he was gone, his genuine, irrepressible smile replayed in her mind. 

He’d smile wholeheartedly over work? 

It must have been about someone he liked. 

After all, she’d seen him smile like that many times before.. 

Every morning in high school, she’d hurriedly finish her milk and rush downstairs, and there he’d be, smiling just like that. He’d walk over, take her heavy backpack, and take her to school on his bike. 

They were both 12 back then, young and bright, immature yet full of life. They were completely smitten with each

other. 

Their love story unfolded just like a romance novel–a bond nurtured over years of growing up side by side. 

They dated in secret, keeping it hidden from both their parents and teachers. They promised to get into the same s versity and make their relationship public one day. 

They pushed each other to improve. In the end, both scored nearly perfect on their SATs and were admitted to Har- vard University, 

Everything should have ended perfectly there. 

But something unexpected happened, 

Just one day before school began, they were in a car crash. When the car was about the hit them**,** Sylvia pushed Adrien out of the way. 

He walked away unharmed, but she was left paralyzed from the waist down. 

Misfortune never comes alone. That same year, Sylvia’s parents died in a plane crash. She buckled under the weig of the blows and fell into a deep depression. 

Adrien was heartbroken. Right after graduation, he proposed. 

He vowed he’d never let her down. 

He had kept his word throughout their three–year marriage. 

But the truth was exposed two weeks ago when Sylvia found his diary. 

The man who declared his love every day had been pouring out his pain in that diary. 

He wrote that he’d proposed out of a sense of duty, fearing that otherwise, everyone would blame him. 

He added that every time he came home, the heavy, suffocating feeling made it hard to breathe, every second he spent with her was a new form of torture. 

He noted that if he could have a second chance, he would have chosen the wheelchair. To him, the physical **suffering** was a far lighter weight than the crushing guilt of her sacrifice. 

He admitted that he’d fallen for another girl, Kiersten Tresham. She was vibrant, bright, and lively, just like Sylvía had been before the crash. 

The next day, Sylvia got several messages from Kiersten. 

“Sylvía, Adrien told me you’ll never walk again. You’ve known each other for so many years. Can’t you just let him go?” 

“Do you realize he’s been trapped in a living hell because of you? He wishes he were dead. But he can’t because he has to put on a brave face and take care of you. How miserable.” 

“If he hadn’t met me, he might’ve lost his mind. Don’t you feel guilty at all? I feel terrible for **him.** Besides, he loves

me now. So, please let him go, so we can be together.” 

Immediately after, Kiersten sent a dozen photos of herself with Adrien. 

Smiling as he brewed coffee, he noticed Kiersten taking a selfie, leaned in, and posed playfully for the camera. 

He peeled a whole plate of shrimp for Kiersten and wiped sauce from her fingers. 

He followed her footprints on the beach, then brought her a handful **of** seashells, a beaming smile on his face. 

By the time she finished looking at all the photos, Sylvia’s heart hurt so badly she could barely breathe**.** It felt like it was shattering. 

But her eyes had run dry of tears, a hollow emptiness staring back from them. 

She didn’t reply, but Kiersten didn’t stop. 

Every day after, Kiersten sent new photos, each stamped with a date. 

On November 21st, Adrien and Kiersten walked together in the park as the sun set. 

On November 26th, they went to a pottery studio and made a vase together. 

On December 1st, they attended a concert, talking about music and their future. 

The photos of them kept coming… 

Each timestamp was a silent contradiction to Adrien’s claims of working late. 

Even on her birthday yesterday, Sylvia waited all day and night for him. 

But he never came back because he was enjoying fireworks with Kiersten. 

Looking at those photos, Sylvia smiled bitterly until tears spilled out. 

Back when they were both 17 years old, Adrien had loved Sylvia with all his heart. 

Now that they were 25, he didn’t love her anymore. 

That night, Sylvia sat by the window all night. The following day, she submitted all the necessary documents to an overseas euthanasia organization, resolved to end her life. 

She thought, “Adrien, you’re all I have left. 

“But you’ve been running from me. 

“Then I will let you **go** and set myself free.” ",1,1766638390.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

The day always started the same: no hard cash, no tobacco, and no alcohol in my blood.

I'd wake up with a trembling body and a throbbing head from the emptiness of the night before. No coffee could wake me up, no routine could sustain me. But something drove me, a primal urge: to go out and pretend to be someone I wasn't. I became a kind of drunken Mortadelo: a master of disguise who changed his skin and style depending on the bar and the victim in front of him. It wasn't just about lying to others; it was about inhabiting, even if only for a few hours, that version of myself that addiction had stolen from me.

To be a good con artist, you couldn't look like one. That was the first commandment.

I wasn't the typical desperate guy who bursts in shouting or with his nerves on edge. No. I was an artist of deception. My strategy didn't begin at the vending machine, but in my closet. I'd get ready, wearing clothes that made me look like someone with a place to go, someone with nothing to hide. I'd walk into the bar with the confidence of someone who rules the world, even though inside I was slowly dying.

I'd choose a bar where no one knew me. Although the script was always the same, what changed was the atmosphere. But it took me very little time to analyze and study the psychology of the people in front of me. In just a few seconds, I'd study the surroundings, dissect the bartender, and understand their weaknesses. Once I had a general idea of ​​their personality, the hacking began. I hacked their mind, and from then on, the system was mine.

I'd sit at the bar, rest my arms calmly, and order a whiskey. That first whiskey was the best-tasting of them all. It wasn't just alcohol; it was the key to my momentary freedom. With that first drink, the monkey retreated, the knot in my stomach loosened, and I began to feel confident. It was the fuel that allowed me to start hatching the plan. Without it, there would have been no actor and no con.

While the bartender served, I began to work. I observed him. I analyzed him. I launched into a calm, measured conversation, with an intellectual tone that made everything seem natural. I became a method actor who believed in his own role. The second whiskey was the definitive entry into character. I needed that exact point of intoxication, that controlled ""high"" that would give me serenity and energy. The most twisted thing was that, to ensure success, I befriended him. The closer I was to him, the less likely he was to suspect me.

My secret tool was in my pocket: a few cents. Worthless small change, but my master key. I didn't use them secretly; On the contrary, I displayed them as part of the act. I did it in reverse: I executed the plan when everyone was watching. I approached the machine, inserted the coins, and pressed the return button. The sound was sharp and resounding: click, click, click. To everyone, it meant: ""That man just put money in.""

Then the show began. I shook the machine and stood there with a confused look on my face. The waiter approached:

""What happened?""

I showed him the coins:

""Look,"" I said sadly, ""he gave me the change, but the cigarettes won't come out.""

""Don't worry,"" he replied, ""what brand did you want?""
That's when the climax arrived. At that precise moment, ""Om,"" that Buddha mantra that symbolizes absolute peace, resonated in my head. At that precise moment, I donned my invisible disguise, shifted character, and transformed into Buddha before his eyes. A being of such profound integrity and calm that it was impossible not to believe him. As that mystical vibration filled my mind, I projected an imperturbable serenity to bend his will. I activated the cruelest reverse psychology:

""Please, it's not necessary,"" I said with the calm of an enlightened being, ""...Neither the money nor the tobacco. I'm so sorry about all this. I used to work in a hotel, and I understand this is a problem for you. If the tobacco vendor comes tomorrow and demands payment, you'll have to pay... I couldn't live with that.""

The waiter felt indebted. His professional pride was wounded by my divine certainty. ""What are you saying, man! Here, here, take the tobacco, of course,"" he insisted. In the end, he accepted the tobacco because he ""needed"" to give it to me to feel better. And the moment he handed it to me, I looked him in the eye and, with all the solemnity in the world, made a sort of Buddha sign with my hand, a silent blessing to put his mind at ease. It was the initial hallmark of the scam: I would steal from him and then make him feel blessed for it.

While I was carrying out the trick, I was already racking up debt on the bar tab. To everyone, I was a nice guy, a friendly, know-it-all. Making my presence seem like a guarantee, when in reality it was a threat, was my greatest theatrical act.

The ending was masterful. I put on a relieved face:

""I'm going outside for a smoke, okay? Save me the whiskey, it's only half empty.""


The waiter, touched by my supposed sanctity, nodded with a smile:

""Relax, don't worry, it's not going anywhere. Smoke in peace.""


Then, I looked at him serenely and made one last kind gesture with my hand, as if to say: ""Relax, you're blessed... blessed. I believe in you."" At that moment, he became the sacred guardian of my debt, convinced that he was protecting the chalice of an extraordinary man.


He didn't know it, but that half-drunk whiskey was my hostage. Logically, no one leaves a paid (or owed) drink half-finished if they don't intend to return it. That glass was the anchor that prevented him from suspecting anything; it was proof that my word meant something, or rather, that my word and my divine gesture had a sacred value. As long as the whiskey remained there, on the bar, under his care, I continued to be the man I wanted to be.

I would go outside, light a cigarette, and take the first drag with brutal intensity. I would fill my lungs with smoke and feel it mix with the alcohol and the adrenaline. For me, at that moment, smoking that cigarette was much more than a dose of nicotine: it was like smoking the peace pipe. A profound inner peace, the relief of having made it through another day, of having triumphed over the system once again.

But then, right after that ecstasy, remorse would assail me. After all, despite being an addict, I was a man of values. I had my principles. That's why I felt deeply guilty for abandoning my ally in that lonely bar... That half-finished whiskey... what a damned waste.

That glass would remain there, like a monument to my departure. The waiter would stare at the half-empty glass for hours, even days, wondering when Buddha, that enlightened man who had taught him a lesson in integrity, would return, unaware that his ""saint"" was already miles away, searching for a new victim.

In those days, there were mornings when I woke up so awful, so ravaged by the need to drink, that the bill for all those ""half-finished whiskeys"" I'd left behind overwhelmed me. The only thing I truly regretted, the thing that pained me deeply as I walked down the street, was leaving that glass half full. That was my only remorse: the waste of abandoning my best ally in a rival bar just so I could get my way.",1,1766637963.0,writingcritiques,0,1.0,False
1pv5hg0,https://youtu.be/d_jRkKqt20M,4 Very Scary TRUE Isolated Fire Lookout Horror Stories,"# ""The Tomhead"":

I got the job as a fire lookout through my college program. It sounded almost too easy—sit alone in a tower, scan the forest for smoke, report anything unusual. A quiet summer, a paycheck, something good for the résumé.

The tower sat high in the mountains of California, in a place called Tomhead, surrounded by endless forest. Tall pines crowded the slopes, their tops swaying like a dark sea. The road up was little more than ruts and loose rock. I parked my truck at the cutoff and hiked the last stretch with my pack biting into my shoulders.

The tower rose on four wooden legs, narrow stairs climbing to a small room perched above the trees. Inside were maps pinned to the walls, a narrow bed, a fold-out table, and a radio that crackled even when no one was speaking. Below, a storage shed held tools, water, and weeks’ worth of food. Once I climbed up and pulled the hatch closed, the world felt very far away.

The first few weeks passed smoothly. Every hour I swept the hills with binoculars, noting wind direction and visibility. Each morning and night, I radioed base.

“All clear at Tomhead,” I’d say.

“Good work,” my supervisor Tom replied every time. “Keep sharp.”

I read books, brewed coffee on the little stove, and learned the voices of the birds. But the longer I stayed alone, the more every sound stood out—the groan of the tower in the wind, branches snapping in the distance, footsteps that turned out to be squirrels. Silence stopped being peaceful and started feeling watchful.

About a month in, I went for a walk around the base of the tower. Something near the tree line caught my eye—a shape that didn’t belong. As I got closer, my stomach tightened.

It was a figure, roughly human-sized, made from sticks, wire, and tangled roots. Its arms stretched outward like a scarecrow. There was no face—just an empty suggestion of one. It looked deliberately placed, planted upright in the soil.

My first thought was that someone had been there while I slept. No hikers ever came this way. The road alone scared most people off.

I grabbed a fallen branch and shoved the thing hard. It toppled over with a brittle crack.

“Stupid thing,” I muttered, more to steady myself than out of anger.

I dragged the pieces deeper into the woods and left them scattered.

The next morning, while eating breakfast, I glanced out the window—and froze.

The figure stood upright again, exactly where it had been before. Whole. Intact. Watching the tower.

My hands shook as I set my cup down. I took the stairs two at a time, searching the ground. No footprints. No tire tracks. Nothing.

I radioed Tom. “Hey, I found this weird wooden figure near the tower. I knocked it down yesterday, but it’s back.”

He chuckled. “Probably some kids or a bored hiker. Break it again and keep an eye out.”

I did more than break it. I smashed it with a hammer, splintered every joint, and buried the remains far from the tower. I felt foolish for being scared—but also relieved.

Two days passed without incident.

Then one evening, as the sun dropped low, I smelled smoke. Not distant wildfire smoke—this was close, sharp, immediate.

I grabbed my binoculars and looked down.

The figure was back again.

Flames flickered at its base, catching on dry grass and pine needles. The fire was small but spreading fast.

I ran down, dumped water from the tank, stomped until my boots smoked. The figure collapsed into blackened sticks. Someone had lit it on purpose.

“Tom,” I said into the radio, my voice tight. “The figure’s back. Someone tried to start a fire under the tower.”

The humor was gone from his voice. “That’s serious. I’ll send a ranger up tomorrow. Lock yourself in tonight.”

I barely slept. Every creak of the tower jolted me awake.

The ranger arrived the next day—a woman named Lisa. She examined the burn marks and shook her head.

“Locals sometimes do this,” she said. “They hate restrictions. They try to scare lookouts off.”

She loaded the remains of the figure into her truck. “Call immediately if anything else happens.”

Weeks went by. No more figures. No more smoke. I started to relax. My season was almost over—just seven nights left.

The last bad night began quietly. I finished my log, ate soup, and prepared for bed.

Just after midnight, heavy footsteps echoed below the tower.

Not one set. Many.

Thump. Thump. Thump.

I crept to the window. Dark shapes moved around the base—ten, maybe twelve figures. Hooded. Silent. They carried sticks, bundles, metal cans.

One struck a match.

The smell of gasoline hit me seconds later.

I grabbed the radio. “Tom! Emergency! People at the tower. They’re starting a fire!”

“Copy that,” he said. “Rangers are en route. Hold on.”

Flames climbed the wooden legs of the tower, crackling loud and hungry. Heat rolled upward. The men stepped back, watching.

One looked up at me. His face stayed hidden.

“You shouldn’t be here,” he called. “This land isn’t for watchers.”

The stairs were already too hot. Smoke filled the room. The tower groaned as the fire ate at it.

I opened the window and looked down. Fifteen feet. Maybe more. I tied a sheet to the railing, but it barely reached halfway.

The flames surged higher.

I climbed out, hung for a breathless second, and let go.

I hit the ground hard, pain screaming through my ankle, but adrenaline dragged me upright. I ran into the trees.

“They’re getting away!” someone shouted.

I ducked, crawled, hid behind a boulder, pressing my hand over my mouth as footsteps passed inches away. Then sirens wailed in the distance. Flashing lights cut through the forest.

The men scattered.

By the time help arrived, the tower was half destroyed. My belongings were burned. Everything I owned up there was gone.

The police asked questions. Faces. Names.

I had none.

Days later, they told me there was no proof anyone else had been there. Rain had erased the tracks.

One officer spoke gently. “Isolation can do things to people. Make them imagine threats.”

They ruled the fire accidental. Stress-induced behavior. Temporary psychosis.

I knew what I saw.

I never went back to lookout work. I took a city job, surrounded by people and noise. But even now, I double-check locks. I listen for footsteps.

Isolation doesn’t just make you see things.

Sometimes it hides people who are waiting for no one to be watching.





# ""No Tracks"":

Last summer, I took a break from my usual city job to help out with the fire lookouts in Colorado’s Pike National Forest. It was meant to be simple work—quiet, routine, a reset. My uncle ran one of the towers, an old wooden structure balanced on iron legs atop a jagged outcrop called Devil’s Head. The name fit. From a distance, the rock jutted up from the forest like a skull breaking the surface of the trees.

My uncle’s name was Harold, though almost no one called him that. To everyone who knew him, he was Doc. Years ago, back home, he’d taught classes on rocks and minerals, the kind of man who could hold a room spellbound talking about quartz veins and fault lines. He was nearly eighty now, his joints stiff and unreliable after an illness that never quite left him, but he refused to give up the tower. He loved the solitude, the long hours watching the horizon for smoke, the soft crackle of the radio breaking the silence.

In late April, he invited me up for the afternoon. “Bring your shovel,” he told me over the phone. “There’s good topaz up here if you know where to look. We’ll dig a bit, then have coffee in the tower.”

I drove up Rampart Range Road under a pale blue sky, the tires rattling over washboard dirt. The air smelled sharp and clean, thick with pine resin. Birds called from somewhere high in the branches, their songs echoing oddly between the rocks. When I reached the turnout near the tower, Doc was already waiting outside the small cabin at the base, leaning on his cane.

He wore his usual outfit: a white cap pulled low, a faded plaid shirt, heavy boots scuffed from decades of use. His smile creased his face deeply when he saw me. I helped him walk to a sandy patch a short distance from the road, no more than fifty yards away. He pointed with his cane.

“Right here,” he said. “Pulled a beauty out of this spot last summer.”

I set him down carefully and handed him his tools—a small pick, a shovel, a canvas bag. “Take it easy,” I told him. “I’ll check over there.” I nodded toward a cluster of rocks farther downslope.

We worked quietly at first, the scrape of metal against sand the only sound between us. After a while, I asked, “How’s the view from the tower been?”

“Clear most mornings,” he said. Then, after a pause, “Though last night was strange.”

I looked up. “Strange how?”

“I heard someone walking around the base of the tower. Slow steps. Deliberate.” He chuckled softly, but it sounded forced. “Shined my light down, didn’t see a thing.”

“Probably a deer,” I said, though even as I said it, the forest felt too still.

“Maybe,” he replied. His voice drifted off, and he went back to digging, humming under his breath.

The afternoon stretched on. By around three, the sun had shifted, shadows lengthening across the sand. “Doc,” I called, “we should head out. I’ll get the car ready.”

“Alright,” he said. “Let me finish this hole.”

I walked back to the car, brushed dirt from my hands, and stowed my tools. It couldn’t have taken more than fifteen minutes. When I returned, I expected to see him just where I’d left him.

The sandy patch was empty.

His small, careful hole was there, neat and shallow. But Doc was gone. So were his tools. The ground around the spot looked undisturbed—no scuffed earth, no fresh footprints beyond the faint impressions he’d already made. No broken branches. No signs of a struggle.

“Doc?” I called.

The word seemed to vanish into the trees. The forest felt wrong, like it was holding its breath. I searched behind nearby rocks, down the slope, calling his name louder each time. Nothing answered me back.

My hands were shaking when I ran for the tower. The door was unlocked, just as he always left it. Inside, everything was in its place. His bed neatly made. His coffee cup washed and drying on the counter. The radio sat on the table, turned on.

I grabbed it. “Base, this is Devil’s Head,” I said, my voice unsteady. “Doc is missing. He was outside digging. He’s gone.”

There was a pause. “Say again?”

“He’s gone,” I repeated. “His tools too. I need help. Now.”

While I waited, I searched again, shouting his name until my throat burned. An hour passed. Then another. The light began to fade, and the forest grew darker, deeper.

That’s when I heard a branch snap.

I froze. Another snap followed, closer this time. Footsteps, slow and measured, crunching dry twigs.

“Who’s out there?” I shouted.

Silence.

Then the steps resumed.

I backed toward the tower, heart pounding so hard I could feel it in my neck. Between the trees, something moved. A figure stepped into view—tall, wearing a dark jacket, face swallowed by shadow. He stood still, watching me.

“What do you want?” I asked. My voice cracked.

He didn’t answer. After a moment, he turned and slipped back into the trees, vanishing as quietly as he’d appeared.

I locked myself inside the tower and didn’t come out until search teams arrived that evening. I told them everything. They brought dogs, ran grids through the forest all night and for days after. The dogs took Doc’s scent from a shirt he’d left behind—and then stopped cold. No trail. No direction. Nothing. It was as if he’d simply ceased to exist.

People nearby shared what they could. A hiker mentioned a strange truck parked along the road that afternoon, couldn’t remember the plates. Others talked about odd noises at night around the lookout, things moving where nothing should have been.

Days turned into weeks. Doc never came back. His wife called me from home, her voice breaking. “He couldn’t walk far,” she said. “Someone must have taken him. Someone had to.”

I stayed on for a while after that, but nights became unbearable. I’d hear footsteps circling the tower, slow and patient. Once, I shone my light into the trees and caught eyes reflecting back at me—low to the ground, steady, wrong.

Eventually, I left. The forest service added extra checks for the lookouts after Doc disappeared, but his case is still open.

No answers. No body.

Just an empty patch of sand at Devil’s Head.





# ""Overdue"":

I finished the climb to the lookout just as the first band of sunlight slid over the jagged peaks. The Hidden Lake tower stood alone above everything else, a small wooden cabin balanced on spindly stilts, its windows wrapping all the way around like unblinking eyes. From up there, the trail unraveled below me—thin, pale, and fragile—snaking through rock fields and alpine meadows before disappearing into the trees.

This was my post for the season. Fire watch in the North Cascades. Watch for smoke. Watch for movement. Watch, mostly, for nothing at all.

The quiet suited me more than I liked to admit.

Inside the tower, the air smelled of old pine and dust. I set up my gear methodically—binoculars, scope, weather charts, maps thumbed soft by years of use. The radio crackled to life as I powered it on.

“Base, this is Hidden Lake. Morning check-in.”

“Roger, Hidden Lake. Paul here,” the voice replied, steady and familiar. “Clear skies today. Any trail traffic yet?”

“Nothing so far. Trail’s empty.”

“Copy that. Report any hikers. Out.”

I logged the time and stepped back to the windows. Hidden Lake glimmered far below, a deep, impossible blue tucked into the valley like a secret. Even in late spring, snow clung stubbornly to the shaded slopes. The climb up here wasn’t forgiving—steep, narrow, exposed. Most hikers underestimated it.

Late morning, movement caught my eye.

A figure emerged on the trail, climbing steadily. An older man, gray hair visible beneath his cap, trekking poles biting into the dirt with practiced rhythm. He moved like someone who’d spent a lifetime outdoors—not fast, but certain. He paused often, resting, scanning the view, then pushing on again.

When he looked up and spotted the tower, I lifted my arm and waved. After a moment’s hesitation, he waved back.

The radio buzzed again.

“You awake up there?” Amy’s voice cut through the static. She was stationed at a lookout a few ridges over.

“Barely,” I said. “What’s up?”

“Got word of a solo hiker heading your way. Older guy, day trip.”

“I see him now. Almost to the ridge.”

“Keep an eye on him. Weather’s been weird. Remember last fall?”

I did. The storm that erased trails in hours. Snow swallowing the mountains whole.

“I’ll log him,” I said.

By the time he reached the ridge, he looked winded but content. He sat on a rock, pulled a snack from his pack, and stared out at the view like he was committing it to memory.

“Nice day for it,” I called down.

He smiled up at me. “First time here. Worth every step.”

“Careful on the descent,” I warned. “Snow patches get slick.”

“I’ll be heading down soon,” he said.

He took photos. One last look around. Then he turned and started back down the trail.

I wrote it neatly in the logbook: *Solo male hiker. Arrived 1100. Departed 1130. No issues observed.*

The afternoon clouds rolled in quietly, softening the peaks until they looked bruised. I ate canned soup and tried to read, but my eyes kept drifting back to the trail.

The radio snapped to life just before dusk.

“Hidden Lake,” Paul said, his tone different now. Tight. “That hiker you logged—he’s overdue. Family reported him missing.”

My stomach dropped. “He left in good condition. Walking steady.”

“We’re dispatching search teams. Stay alert.”

I swept the trail with binoculars until my eyes ached. From up here, it was impossible to see every switchback, every chute and shadow. As night fell, headlamps began to flicker below—small, fragile lights bobbing against the vast dark.

They called his name. The sound echoed back hollow and distorted, swallowed by stone.

The wind picked up after midnight, slipping through the tower’s seams with a high, thin whistle. I locked the door and turned on the lamp.

That’s when I heard it.

A scraping sound. Slow. Deliberate.

I froze, listening. Maybe branches. Maybe an animal drawn to the light.

Then it came again—closer this time.

I leaned toward the window and shone my flashlight across the catwalk. Nothing. Empty boards. Blackness beyond.

“Paul,” I said into the radio, keeping my voice low. “I’m hearing noises outside.”

Static. Then, “Probably wildlife. Stay inside.”

The scratching stopped.

The man was never found.

Weeks passed. Then months. Search efforts thinned, then faded. One of the volunteers, a quiet man named Bud who preferred to search alone, climbed up to the tower one afternoon.

“This place doesn’t give things back easy,” he said, gazing down the slopes. “Too many ways to fall. Too many places to disappear.”

In the fall, another hiker appeared on the trail. A young woman with red hair, moving fast, almost excited. Birthday adventure, she told me, laughing as the wind tugged at her jacket.

I gave the same warnings. Logged the same details.

She vanished too.

Snow fell that night, erasing footprints, erasing answers.

After that, sleep became a negotiation. Every knock of wind sounded like footsteps. Every creak felt intentional. Sometimes I thought I heard voices—soft, pleading—but when I checked, there was only the mountain breathing around me.

When they finally found the woman months later, she was far downslope. Evidence she’d tried to survive. Cold had won.

The older man was found too. Broken at the base of a cliff.

But that night—when I heard the voice outside the tower, whispering *help*—that never fit.

The body had been there all along.

And sometimes, when the wind is right, I still don’t answer the knocking.





# ""The Ridge"":

The radio crackled to life just as I was halfway through lunch, the sudden burst of static loud enough to make me jump. I sat alone at the small fold-down table in my cabin, a sandwich in one hand, my boots kicked off by the door. The tower stood high on the ridge, a spindly wooden structure bolted into bare rock, giving me an uninterrupted view of miles of forest rolling away in every direction. Pines, ridgelines, shadowed valleys—beautiful, endless, and deceptively quiet.

My job was simple: spot fires early and call them in. The cabin had everything I needed and nothing I didn’t—a narrow bed, a propane stove, maps tacked to the walls, and the radio that connected me to the rest of the world. It was lonely work, but I liked it that way. No traffic, no people, no noise except wind and birds and the occasional creak of the tower shifting under its own weight.

“Lookout Three, this is base. Anything to report?”

The voice belonged to Bill, one of the senior rangers. He checked in every few hours, always calm, always steady.

“All clear,” I said, swallowing the last bite of my sandwich. “No smoke today.”

“Good. Keep watching,” Bill replied, then hesitated just long enough for me to notice. “We’ve had reports of people in the area who shouldn’t be there. Stay alert. Stay safe.”

The radio clicked off.

I stared at it for a moment longer than necessary. People who shouldn’t be there could mean anything—lost hikers, poachers, squatters—but Bill’s tone made my stomach tighten. I packed up my lunch and climbed the narrow ladder to the observation deck, the metal rungs cold even in the afternoon sun.

I scanned the tree line slowly, methodically, binoculars sweeping left to right. At first, I saw nothing unusual—just wind stirring the treetops. Then I caught movement near a rocky outcrop below the ridge.

Three men.

They wore mismatched camouflage and moved with purpose, slipping through the brush in a way that suggested they didn’t want to be seen. Each carried a long gun slung low. Not hunters. Hunting wasn’t allowed anywhere near this zone, and they weren’t acting like hunters anyway—no talking, no wandering, no casual posture.

I watched them for several minutes. At one point, one of them stopped, tilted his head, and looked up toward the tower. He nudged another and pointed.

I felt suddenly, acutely visible.

They didn’t linger. After a brief exchange, they continued downhill, disappearing into thicker cover.

I was on the radio immediately. “Bill, I spotted three men in camo with rifles moving through the trees south of the tower. Pretty sure they noticed me.”

There was a pause on the line. When Bill spoke again, his voice had hardened. “Copy that. Could be growers. We’ve had problems with illegal sites in those woods. Don’t investigate. Don’t engage. I’ll send a patrol first thing tomorrow.”

“Understood,” I said, though my pulse hadn’t slowed.

Just stay inside, I told myself. Easy enough.

That evening, the forest darkened faster than usual, clouds swallowing the last light. I cooked rice on the stove and ate by the window, listening to the wind push through the trees. Then I heard it—engines. Low at first, then closer. Headlights cut through the timber, bouncing along the dirt road that led toward the tower.

Two trucks rolled to a stop near the base.

My chest tightened as doors opened. Flashlights snapped on. The beams swung wildly, searching.

One of them climbed the stairs and knocked hard on the cabin door.

“Hey! Open up!”

I grabbed the radio with shaking hands. “Bill, they’re here. At my door.”

“Lock it down,” he said instantly. “Help’s on the way, but it’ll be at least an hour.”

The knock came again, heavier this time. “We know you’re in there. Just want to talk.”

I swallowed and raised my voice. “What do you want?”

A laugh, sharp and humorless. “You saw us earlier. Thought we’d clear things up. Don’t tell anyone… and we won’t have a problem.”

“Leave now,” I shouted. “Rangers are coming.”

They whispered among themselves. Then one said quietly, “We’ll see about that.”

Lights moved around the cabin. Flashlights pressed against the windows, trying to peer inside. I crouched under the table, heart pounding so hard I thought they might hear it. The door handle rattled once. Locked.

Then, silence.

Engines started. Tires crunched on gravel. The trucks drove off.

I radioed Bill again. “They’re gone. Shook me up bad.”

“Patrol will sweep the area in the morning,” he said. “If you need to, stay up in the tower tonight.”

I didn’t argue. I climbed the ladder to the top room and locked the hatch behind me. From up there, I watched the road until the last hint of headlights vanished.

The patrol arrived the next day—two rangers, hands resting casually near their sidearms. They searched the area for hours.

“Found their camp,” one told me. “Grow site nearby. Plants already cut. Looks like they packed up fast.”

I hesitated. “Do you think they’ll come back?”

“Hard to say,” the ranger said. “But we’ll keep an eye on the road.”

They left, and the forest settled back into uneasy quiet.

Two days later, I saw one of the men again.

He was alone this time, walking the trail below the tower like he belonged there. He stopped, looked up, and waved. Friendly. Almost cheerful.

I didn’t wave back.

He smiled anyway and continued down the trail.

That night, sleep wouldn’t come. Every sound felt amplified. Around midnight, I heard footsteps on the porch—slow, deliberate, heavy.

I sat up in bed. “Who’s there?”

No answer.

The door handle rattled.

I grabbed the heaviest pot from the stove. “Go away!”

A voice came through the door, low and flat. “You saw too much.”

The door shuddered as he leaned into it. Wood creaked. A window cracked, spiderwebs racing across the glass. A hand forced its way through.

I swung the pot as hard as I could. It connected with a sickening thud. He screamed and yanked his hand back.

“You’ll regret that!” he snarled.

I ran for the ladder, climbed into the tower, and slammed the hatch shut. Locked.

He pounded on the door below. “Come down here!”

Instead, I grabbed the signal flare. When he started climbing the outer stairs, his face appeared in the glass—eyes wide, furious, unhinged.

“Open it!”

I fired the flare through a vent. It burst into blinding light near his shoulder. He screamed and stumbled backward, nearly falling.

Then he ran—down the stairs, into the trees.

I stayed up there until dawn.

The rangers arrived soon after. “Found blood on the window,” one said. “From his hand.”

They tracked him a short distance and found him hiding in the brush, burned and bleeding. One of the growers. Furious that his operation had been shut down after I spotted them.

Bill called later that day. “You did exactly what you were supposed to. He’s in custody now.”

I finished out the summer, but I didn’t sign on again. Those footsteps on the porch, the hand forcing through the glass—they stayed with me. Remote jobs seem peaceful, but isolation cuts both ways.

The forest doesn’t just hide animals. It hides people.

hi, my name is Nina, i’m a bi, neurodivergent woman in her mid-twenties, trying the best not to cry...

this is my first Christmas alone, because i recently left home due to domestic violence. it’s way better than before, of course, but i’m so sad at the same time. nobody cares about me AT ALL, it’s heartbreaking.

so if you are experiencing the same, please feel free to reach out!

i’m looking for a significant other, maybe someone who can understand what i’ve experienced and still can be there for me. i want someone to be with, so we can keep each other company.

i’m a listener, but also a caring person who will be by your side always, no matter how hard it gets.

my love language are gifts and acts of service. 

about me: i work as a English tutor. i’m a huge bookworm, so i’m into psychology, drama and romance. i’m trying to write my own novel too, so i write a lot. i studied photography, but now, i only do film as a hobby. i like cozy games like Animal Crossing, but i enjoyed Bioshock and Life is Strange so much too. anyone who can teach me how to play Minecraft? 

i always drink coffee in the mornings with a cig, that’s mandatory. i looooove music. r&b, indie and dubstep mostly. i used to be a folklore singer and i played percussions as well. i also do scrapbooks and some junk journaling. i wanna travel in the future, that’s one of my dreams, and i’m bilingual, but i wanna learn a third language: Chinese.

Currently surrounded by coffee atm, white peach matcha iced, and chamomile hot, is that weird I like to always have water, tea, and either hot or iced coffee on my desk? I love it. I'll buy Christmas roses tomorrow, light a candle for my mum. 

  
Going to shower and shampoo, do my hair and make up real pretty like for the festivities.. I found a favorite scented body wash and body butter tonight at the get this, Walgreens (!) around the corner. It's Tree Hut's Moroccan Rose, and I bought the body scrub on a whim one day after running out of my regular stuff because it was there and I heard good things about it from online reviews.

Well, the scrub is gorg, and trying the whipped shea body butter tonight, it's light, not too heavy/greasy... both body wash and body butter smell nearly identical to the scrub, which is what I was looking for. The scent is heavenly, and will pair nicely with my Jo Malone peony and blush suede perfume. I'll layer them together.

I’m 29, fit body with a sharp mind and a creative soul. A lover of all things nature, food, and animals. I’ve got messy hair, a dimple on my left cheek, and eyes that see deeper than most.

Witty banter, endless memes, and conversations that go far beyond the surface. I don’t want just passion, I want emotion. I want romance. I want chemistry that sets us both on fire.

I want to be your favorite notification and your go to distraction. I want to make your heart skip a beat when you see my name pop up on your screen, make you smile from cheek to cheek and bite your lips at the same time.

For unless it's mad, passionate, extraordinary love, it's a waste of time. There are many mediocre things in life, love should not be one of them.

So how do we do this? Coffee in a cute café filled with gingerbread smells? A day spent talking till the lights come on? A Christmas movie marathon with fuzzy socks? Let’s connect. Let me get to know you.

I(30 M,) never thought I’d be writing something like this, but I don’t really know where else to put it. I can put it in a police report but my mom dont want that.

Growing up  i always thought my parents had a quiet marriage. Not happy abd not loud either. My dad was the type who liked things orderly. Dinner at the same time, the TV volume just right, no talking back. My mom adjusted herself around him so smoothly that I didn’t notice it for years. I thought that was just how she was and i found out by accident.


I was home earlier than usual one afternoon a week ago and because it's my day off , i went to check on ny parents and i heard voices from their room. At first I didn’t think much of it, until I heard something hit the wall and then my mom cried out. Not loud. More like she was trying not to be heard i froze in the hallway. I didn’t want to believe what my ears were telling me, but then the door opened and my dad walked out like nothing happened 

 calm and normal . he barely even looked at me.

When I went into the room, my mom was sitting on the edge of the bed, holding her arm. She smiled at me and said she was fine. She always said she was fine. But this time I didn’t let it go. I asked her straight up what was happening. She tried to brush it off, then she started crying. That was the first time I ever saw her really break.
That night she told me everything. That it wasn’t new. That it had been happening for years. Only when they were alone. Only when he was angry or felt disrespected. 

She said he never hit her face because he didn’t want marks. She said she stayed because she thought it was better for me and my sister . hearing that hurt more than anything else.

she asked me to leave and i did bec i was stunned with what happened. I was never close with my dad bec he has been strict my whole life. And my sister is the only person he shows much affection for . 


i didn’t sleep that night. I kept replaying every memory of my childhood, every time my dad seemed irritated, every time my mom went quiet. I realized how blind I had been.
The next day , I packed a bag. I asked my boss to give me an emergency vacation leave and then I packed another one for my mom with some clothes she left in my apartment whenever she visits my place 

 When my dad left for work, I told her we were leaving. She hesitated. She was scared. She's just 49 years old and has been a housewife for a very long time . she kept saying he would be angry, that we didn’t have a plan, that it might get worse. I told her I didn’t care. I told her I wasn’t letting her stay there another day.
We left with just clothes and important documents. I took her to an airbnb that is 4 hrs away from home. It’s cramped and not ideal, but it’s quiet.ive saved alot of money for the last years that i was about to use for buying a new home but i will do it with my mom this time.

The airbnb is quiet that doesn’t make you flinch. Ny mom keeps on crying day and night. Ive read alot of reddit stories and i know what a trauma bonding looks life and this is one of the best examples.


My mom barely slept. She apologized constantly for taking up space, for eating my food, for crying. I kept telling her she didn’t owe me anything. That she was safe. That was all that mattered.
My dad blew up my phone. Angry messages at first, then apologetic ones, then angry again. I blocked him. That was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done, but also one of the easiest once I actually did it.
Now we live together. I work from home for now and she’s slowly figuring out what she wants to do next. Some days she’s strong. Some days she’s quiet. But she laughs more now. She watches shows she likes without worrying about volume. She sleeps through the night.
I still feel angry sometimes. At my dad. At myself. At how long this went on without me knowing. But when I see my mom making coffee in the morning, relaxed, unafraid, I know I did the right thing.
I don’t know what the future looks like. I just know she’s not behind closed doors anymore, and neither am I.

So am i the asshole for meddling in my parents marriage?

1pv5bz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pv5bz8/ro_the_feeling_of_freedom/,[RO] The Feeling of Freedom,"Part One: The Square

The Charles Bridge was a cliché, and Maya knew it. She stood among a hundred other tourists, all of them tilting phones at the same baroque saints, and felt the familiar disappointment of arriving somewhere famous only to find it exactly as photographed.

She’d finished her LSAT prep three weeks early. Her mother had called it “obsessive.” Her roommate had called it “so Maya.” The Europe trip was supposed to be her answer to both of them—proof that she could be spontaneous, that she wasn’t just a GPA in a cardigan.

So far, she had visited four museums, two historically significant churches, and a café recommended by the New York Times. She had taken notes.

The afternoon light turned the Vltava into hammered copper. Maya checked her phone: 4:47 p.m. She had a reservation at 6:00. Time enough to walk the Old Town Square one more time, maybe buy a magnet for her mother, stick to the—

“Don’t move.”

She froze. A young man stood six feet away, one eye pressed to a battered film camera. He wore a linen shirt the color of oatmeal, sleeves rolled to the elbows. His hair was dark and needed cutting.

The shutter clicked.

“Sorry.” He lowered the camera, smiling in a way that seemed almost embarrassed. “The light on your face—I couldn’t help it. You looked like you were trying to solve the bridge.”

“I wasn’t—” Maya started, then stopped. She had been, in a way. Trying to figure out why she felt so unmoved by something so beautiful.

“I’m Julian.” He didn’t extend his hand. “And that was rude of me. Here.” He advanced the film, rewound it, popped open the camera, and held out the canister. “It’s yours. Get it developed, burn it, whatever you want. That way, I haven’t stolen anything from you.”

Maya looked at the small black cylinder in his palm. “You’re giving me your whole roll?”

“Just that one shot.” He shrugged. “The rest were pigeons.”

She laughed despite herself. “I can’t take your film.”

“Then don’t.” He set it gently on the bridge railing between them. “Leave it for the next person. Either way, I hope you figure out the bridge.” He gave a small wave and turned, disappearing into the current of tourists flowing toward Malá Strana.

Maya stood there for a moment, watching the space where he’d been. Then she picked up the canister and dropped it into her bag.

\---

She got the film developed the next morning at a tiny shop near her hostel. The man behind the counter raised an eyebrow at the single roll but said nothing. An hour later, she was sitting on a bench in Letná Park, thumbing through the stack.

She began to flip through them quickly, and the photos blurred into a strange, jerky animation. The same stone saint, the same patch of bridge, but the shadows were dancing—circling the statues like the hands of a clock, lengthening across the cobblestones until the morning gray turned to a searing noon white and then to the heavy, liquid amber of five o’clock. It was like watching a ghost film of a day she had already lived.

A single pigeon appeared in frame twenty-eight, a sharp gray smudge against the stone.

Then she reached the final photo.

It was good. Better than good. The light caught her mid-thought, brow slightly furrowed, lips parted like she was about to speak. She looked interesting. She looked like someone things happened to.

She studied her own face until a notification buzzed: Reminder: 2:00 p.m. train to Vienna.

Vienna was next on her spreadsheet. Then Salzburg, then Munich, then home, then law school, then the rest of her life, scheduled in fifteen-minute increments until she died.

Maya put the photograph in her journal, went back to her hostel, and began to pack.

\---

Part Two: The Station

Praha hlavní nádraží was a cathedral of noise and diesel. Maya stood in front of the departures board, rolling suitcase at her side, watching the destination cities cascade down the digital display. Vienna in eleven minutes. Platform 3.

She was turning toward the platform when she saw him.

Julian sat on a bench near the far wall, camera bag at his feet, reading a paperback with a cracked spine. It was a dense, cheap Italian edition of a Pavese novel, the pages yellowed and brittle. He didn’t look up until she was almost on top of him.

“Pigeons again?”

He blinked, his thumb holding his place near the end of the book. Then recognition spread across his face, warm and surprised. “Bridge girl. You developed it?”

“This morning.” She felt absurdly proud of this, like she’d passed a test. “It’s good.”

“No. You’re good. I just pointed the camera.” He dog-eared his page and closed the book. “Vienna?”

“How did you know?”

“Everyone goes to Vienna.” He said it without judgment, just observation. “Let me guess. Then Salzburg. Munich. Maybe a night in Amsterdam if you’re feeling wild.”

Maya’s cheeks heated. “It’s a good itinerary.”

“It’s everyone’s itinerary.” He tilted his head, studying her the way he’d studied her on the bridge. “You want to know where I’m going?”

She shouldn’t ask. Her train was in six minutes. “Where?”

“I don’t know yet.” He pulled a folded map from his jacket pocket, soft and worn at the creases. “My grandmother grew up on the Adriatic coast. In a village so small that it’s not on most maps. Before she died, she told me about this beach—she said when she was a girl, she used to think it was the edge of the world. I’m going to find it.”

“That’s—” Maya searched for the right word. “That sounds like a lot of guessing.”

“That’s the point.” He smiled. “Vienna will still be there in fifty years. In a hundred. Some of these places won’t. Some of these places might only exist right now, in this exact form, and then never again.” He stood, shouldering his bag. “Anyway. Enjoy the Ringstraße.”

He was walking away again. Just like on the bridge.

“Wait.” The word was out before she could stop it.

Julian turned.

“This beach,” Maya said. Her heart was hammering. “This—edge of the world. Is it far?”

“A few days, probably. Trains, buses, maybe a fishing boat. Why?”

Six minutes. Her whole spreadsheet. Her mother. Law school.

“Can I come?”

He didn’t answer immediately. He looked at her—really looked, the way no one had ever looked at her, like he was seeing past her résumé and her plans and her sensible waterproof backpack, like he was seeing something underneath all of it.

“You don’t know me,” he said.

“No.”

“I could be anyone.”

“You gave me your film.”

Something shifted in his expression. A decision. “Your train leaves in four minutes.”

“I know.”

“You’d be leaving everything. Your whole plan.”

“I know.”

Julian reached out and took her suitcase handle. His fingers brushed hers, just for a second, cool and dry.

“Then let’s find the edge of the world.”

\---

Part Three: The Road

They took a night train to Ljubljana, then a bus to a town whose name Maya couldn’t pronounce. Julian traded his last Czech crowns for two cups of thick, sweet coffee at a station café while Maya watched the mountains turn pink with dawn.

“I never do things like this,” she said.

“I know.” He slid a cup across the table. “That’s why you’re doing it.”

They talked for hours, then fell asleep with their heads tilted toward each other, waking in a new country. Everything felt heightened, sharper—the smell of diesel and wildflowers, the weight of her bag on her shoulders, the way Julian’s hand found the small of her back when they navigated a crowded platform.

On the second day, crossing a stone bridge in Kotor, Maya pulled out her phone to photograph the fortress walls. Julian caught her wrist gently.

“Can I say something? You can tell me to go to hell if you want.”

“Okay.”

“You’ve been on your phone for maybe three hours total since we left Prague. Three hours out of forty. And every time you put it away, you look—” He searched for the word. “Relieved.”

Maya stared at the screen. Seventeen notifications. Her mother, twice. Her roommate. A calendar alert for a Vienna walking tour she’d already missed.

“It’s like a leash,” Julian said. “Everyone you know is on the other end, pulling.”

“It’s how I stay organized.”

“I know. And look where organized got you. Standing on a bridge in Montenegro with a stranger, the happiest I’ve seen you all week.” He released her wrist. “Forget I said anything.”

But she couldn’t forget. That night, walking along the waterfront, her phone rang—her mother, for the third time—and Maya felt a spike of something that might have been panic.

“I don’t want to talk to her,” she said. “I don’t want to explain.”

“So don’t.”

“She’ll worry.”

“Send her a postcard tomorrow. Tell her you’re alive and happy and exploring.” He paused. “Or don’t. It’s your call. I just—” He laughed softly. “I spent two years chained to my phone for a job I hated. When I finally threw it in a river, I cried. Actual tears. And then I felt free for the first time in my life.”

Maya looked at the device in her hand. All her contacts. Her emails. Her spreadsheet.

The bay stretched dark and glassy before them.

“I’m not saying throw it,” Julian said. “I’m saying—what if you just put it away for a few days? Turned it off. Let yourself actually be here.”

She thought about the photograph he’d given her. The girl who looked like someone things happened to.

“What if there’s an emergency?”

“Then the emergency will still be there in a week. But this—” He gestured at the mountains, the water, the stars crowding the sky. “This won’t.”

Maya turned off her phone. The screen went black, and she felt something loosen in her chest. She looked at Julian, at the easy way he leaned against the railing, unhurried, unscheduled. He never wore a watch, she’d noticed. Never once checked the time. He moved through the world like it would wait for him—and standing here, she was starting to believe it might wait for her too.

\---

Part Four: The Water

On the fourth day, they caught a ferry to Albania.

Julian had found them a guesthouse through a friend of a friend, a whitewashed building on a cliff above an empty beach. The owner, an elderly woman named Drita, spoke no English but smiled at Maya like a grandmother welcoming her home.

“It’s perfect,” Maya said, standing on the balcony as the sun sank into the Adriatic, turning the water gold.

“We’re close.” Julian came up behind her, resting his chin on her shoulder. “The beach my grandmother told me about—it’s somewhere near here. A few coves south. We’ll find it tomorrow.”

She leaned back into him. “What happens when we find it?”

“I don’t know.” His breath was warm against her ear. “Isn’t that the best part?”

\---

The next morning, they hiked along the coastal trail, scrambling over rocks and through scrub brush. Julian went first, reaching back to help her over the difficult parts. At one point, Maya slipped on loose shale, and he caught her so quickly she barely felt herself fall.

“I’ve got you,” he said. “I’ll always catch you.”

Around noon, they found a sea cave carved into the cliff face. The water inside was the impossible blue-green of a gemstone, light rippling across the limestone walls.

“We should swim,” Julian said.

Maya looked at the water. “Our stuff—”

“I’ll keep it safe.” He pulled a waterproof pouch from his bag. “Phones, passports, money—it all goes in here. Completely dry, even if we dive.”

She handed over her passport without thinking. Her wallet. Her powered-off phone. Julian zipped them into the pouch, along with his own documents, and wedged it into a dry crevice in the rock.

“There. Now we’re just two people in the water.”

They swam until their muscles ached. Maya floated on her back, staring up at the sliver of sky visible through the cave mouth, and felt tears prick her eyes.

“You okay?” Julian surfaced beside her.

“I don’t know how to explain it.” She struggled to find words. “I feel like I’ve been asleep my whole life. And now I’m finally awake.”

He kissed her, slow and salt-tinged. “That’s not sleep. That’s fear. You’ve been afraid your whole life, and you didn’t even know it.”

She clung to him in the blue water, this man who had seen her on a bridge and recognized something worth saving.

“I’m not afraid anymore,” she said.

“I know.” He smiled. “That’s why you’re here.”

\---

Part Five: The Money

On the seventh day, Julian’s credit card was declined.

They were at a small restaurant in Sarandë, the check sitting between them. Julian stared at the machine like he could will it to work.

“The bank,” he said. “International charges. They do this sometimes.”

Maya was already pulling out her card. “I’ve got it.”

“I’ll sort it out tonight. Call them, or—”

“Jules. It’s fine.”

She paid. And something small and warm settled in her chest as she did—a feeling she couldn’t quite name. Her whole life, she’d been the one who was managed, handled. Her mother, planning her future; her advisors, mapping her path. And here was Julian, looking embarrassed, looking human, and here was Maya fixing it. Being the capable one. Being needed.

It happened again two days later. Then again.

“I hate this,” he said, after the third time.

“I don’t.”

He looked at her.

“I mean it,” she said. “You’ve given me—” She gestured at the sea, the mountains, all of it. “Let me give you something back.”

He kissed her hand. Didn’t argue.

By the fifth time, she paid without thinking. It felt like a partnership, she told herself. It was an investment in the future. It was the beginning of a life.

\---

Part Six: The Destination

On the morning of the ninth day, Maya woke up homesick.

She couldn’t explain it. The guesthouse was beautiful, Julian was asleep beside her, the Adriatic glittered outside the window. But she lay there watching the ceiling fan turn and thought about her mother’s kitchen. Her own bed. The weight of her phone in her hand, full of messages from people who knew her last name.

“Hey.” Julian’s voice was soft, sleep-rough. “You’re thinking too loud.”

“Sorry.”

He propped himself on one elbow, studying her face. “What’s wrong?”

“Nothing. I just—” She sat up, pulling the sheet around her shoulders. “I was thinking maybe we could head back a little early. Not today, but tomorrow. I should probably check in with my mom. And I have some law school stuff I should—”

“Maya.” He said her name like it was something precious. “Look at me.”

She looked.

“I love you.”

The words landed in her chest like a stone in still water. She felt the ripples spread outward, washing everything else away.

“What?”

“I love you.” He sat up, took her hands. “I’ve known for days. I was going to wait—I had this whole thing planned, the beach, sunset, very dramatic—but I can’t watch you sit there worrying about spreadsheets and not say it.” He laughed softly. “I love you. And whatever you’re afraid of, whatever’s pulling you back—it can wait. One more day. That’s all I’m asking. Let me show you the beach. Let me give you the ending this deserves.”

Maya’s eyes were wet. “Jules—”

“One day. And then if you want to go home, I’ll put you on a plane myself. I’ll carry your bags. I’ll buy you a neck pillow.” He kissed her knuckles. “But give me today. Please.”

She thought about law school. Her mother. The life waiting for her on the other side of all this.

She thought about the way he’d said I love you, like it was the simplest thing in the world.

“Okay,” she said. “One more day.”

\---

The cove was everything he’d described.

They’d taken a fisherman’s boat around the final headland. Julian charmed the old man, stumbling through his broken Italian with an easy, apologetic smile. He used his hands to describe the curve of the cove, pointing at the headland and saying bella and spiaggia like a man who had learned the words ten minutes ago from a guidebook.

The fisherman didn’t smile back. He watched Julian with a flat, expectant intensity, waited for him to finish, and then gave a single, sharp nod.

When the cliffs parted and the beach appeared, Maya actually gasped.

White sand, untouched. Water so clear she could see schools of fish darting thirty feet below. Cliffs rising on three sides, sheltering the cove from the world.

“It’s real,” Julian breathed. “She was telling the truth.”

They swam. They lay on the sand. Julian took a hundred photographs—of the beach, of the light, of Maya reading in the shade of a rock. As the sun began to set, they watched the sky go from orange to pink to something almost green at the edges.

“I love you too,” Maya said. “I should have said it this morning. I was just—”

“I know.” He pulled her close. “You were scared.”

“I’m not anymore.”

“Good.” He kissed the top of her head. “I knew on the bridge, you know. The second I saw you. I thought—there she is.”

“There she is?”

“The one I’ve been looking for.”

Maya kissed him hard, her hands in his hair. She didn’t notice the boat until Julian pulled away, looking past her toward the water.

“Oh,” he said. “That’s our ride.”

\---

Part Seven: The Horizon

The yacht was white, sleek, expensive. It sat at anchor in the cove, pristine against the darkening sea. On its stern, gold letters spelled a name: The Horizon.

“Whose is this?” Maya asked.

“A friend.” Julian was already gathering their bags. “I told you I had a surprise. A proper dinner. A bed that isn’t a hostel mattress. One nice night before we go back to the real world.”

A tender motored toward them, piloted by a man in a dark polo shirt. He didn’t smile.

Maya watched the yacht grow larger as the tender approached. Something nagged at her—a small, sharp thing, like a splinter she couldn’t quite locate.

“Jules.” She kept her voice light. “I thought your cards were frozen.”

“They are.”

“So how—” She gestured at the yacht, the uniformed pilot, the whole gleaming impossibility of it.

“I told you. A friend.” He smiled, easy and warm. “A guy I met in Morocco a few years ago. Tech money, retired at thirty-two, sails around buying art and avoiding his ex-wives. I shot his daughter’s wedding in Marrakech—he said if I ever needed anything, just call.” Julian shrugged, as if summoning yachts were simply what happened when you lived without a schedule. “I’ve been saving it for something special.” He tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. “You’re something special.”

The splinter dissolved. Of course. A favor from a rich eccentric. It was the kind of thing that happened to people like Julian—people who moved through the world open-handed, who collected friends instead of frequent flyer miles. It made sense. Everything with Julian made sense, once he explained it.

“I wanted to tell you earlier,” he said, “but I wanted to see your face when you saw it. Was it worth it?”

Maya looked at the yacht, the water, the man who had said I love you that morning like it was the easiest truth he’d ever told.

“Yes,” she said. “It was worth it.”

The tender bumped against the swim platform. Julian stepped aboard first, then turned and offered her his hand.

“Trust me,” he said. “Have I let you down yet? Even once?”

She thought about the coffee in Ljubljana. The ferry tickets. The waterproof pouch in the sea cave. A hundred small kindnesses, a hundred moments when he’d made her feel safe.

“No.”

“Then trust me one more time.”

She took his hand and stepped onto the yacht.

\---

The yacht’s interior was all white leather and polished chrome. The man in the polo led them below deck to a stateroom with a queen bed and an ensuite bathroom.

“Thirty minutes to dinner,” he said. His accent was vague, Eastern European. “You can freshen up.”

When he left, Maya turned to Julian. “This is incredible.”

“You deserve incredible.” He was checking something on his phone—when had he gotten his phone back?—but he looked up and smiled. “Take a shower. Relax. I’m going to go up and check on some things.”

“Things?”

“Dinner things. Surprise things.” He kissed her forehead. “Twenty minutes. Then I’ll come get you.”

He left. Maya stood in the stateroom, listening to the hum of the engines. Had the engines been running before? She couldn’t remember.

She showered. Changed into the one nice dress she’d packed in Prague, a lifetime ago. Applied makeup for the first time in a week.

Twenty minutes passed. Then thirty. Then forty-five.

Maya opened the stateroom door and climbed the stairs to the deck.

\---

The coastline was half a mile away.

Maya stood at the railing, fingers white-knuckled on the polished steel, watching the cliffs recede. The cove was already invisible, hidden behind the headland. The fisherman’s village was a scatter of lights, shrinking.

“Jules?”

No answer.

She turned. Two men stood at the far end of the deck. Polos. Hands clasped in front of them. They weren’t looking at her.

“Jules!”

The tender was in the water, motoring back toward shore. In it, she could see three figures: the pilot, a man in a gray suit, and—

Julian.

Maybe the man in the suit was the friend from Morocco. Maybe this was all still part of the surprise. But friends didn’t shake hands like that—formal, contractual. Friends didn’t pass envelopes, small and thick.

Julian checked his watch with the precision of a man who had never been late for a deadline in his life. He said something she couldn’t hear. Then he walked toward a black SUV parked at the end of the pier, his stride easy and unhurried, his camera bag over his shoulder.

He didn’t look back.

The men in the dark polos moved to stand on either side of her. They did not touch her. They did not speak. They did not look at her face.

The yacht’s engines thrummed. The coastline shrank. The dark came in fast.

Maya stared at the place where Julian had been—the pier, the SUV, the country she would never see again—until there was nothing left to see.

The wind cut across the deck. The wake spread white behind them.

In the village, a dog barked once and went silent.

On the yacht, Maya stood between two shadows, her eyes fixed on nothing, her hands still gripping the railing as if, were she to let go, she might simply cease to exist.

Maya opened her mouth to scream, but her lungs wouldn’t take the air. She was a photograph of a girl on a bridge.

A girl who looked interesting. A girl who looked like someone things happened to.",1,1766637281.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1pv5ah0,https://i.redd.it/g1twrhc53a9g1.jpeg,For everyone who’s lost someone. My Christmas Story.,"My mom passed on 12/31/2022. This time of year. I hate the holidays now, it never gets easier. But, this helps me. I’ve made tweaks since last year. For everyone who has lost someone:

There once was a boy who was now grown and tall,

He loved all of Christmas, but one part most of all.

Now, year after year, even though she lived quite far away,

He always made sure be with his mom on Christmas Day.

Whether by car or by plane, it was quite a long trip,

But when he arrived, Mom would have hot cider to sip.

He was too old for Santa and such, and he knew what she got him at a glance,

His mom always got him some fuzzy, Star Wars Christmas-time pants.

No matter the distance to travel, he didn’t mind it, its true,

And as he grew up, he began to bring his own family, too.

Then finally one year, some news most glad!

His mom and her husband became Grandma and Grandad.

But as with all things, these good times don’t last,

And Mom became sick with something they all had thought passed.

Even though she was ill, she made it to her sons big promotion,

Everyone told her to rest, but she made quite the commotion.

Then that same year they gathered for Christmas ‘round Mom’s hospital bed,

It was quite sad for all, but the best stories were told, and fondest things said.

Then one night, as the son turned to leave, “I’ll see you tomorrow Mom, I love you.”

From the deepest of slumbers, she somehow heard and replied, “I love you too.”

Then the next day, they all had gathered not long after dawn,

And the woman they loved so much had finally gone.

The next day was New Years, supposedly full of hopes and surprise,

But the son simply stood near the bay watching the coldest morning sun rise.

Now years had gone by, Christmas Eve again at last,

The son was still painfully haunted by that holiday past.

The whole year had hurt, the world was still much less,

Despite all that he had, his life felt a mess.

His wife now asleep, and daughter tucked in bed,

He swore he heard a clomp, like a heavy boot with tread.

With a sprint he shot to the living room and couldn’t believe what he saw there,

A great, jolly figure clad all red and white, but then, what else would this elf wear?

He tried to rationalize, to reason, but what he saw still gave him great pause,

There on the couch, in the soft light of the tree, sat the one and only Santa Clause.

The son couldn’t believe it and could barely make out, “I’m too old for this, I know this can’t be true.”

With a rosy-cheeked grin, old Kringle replied, “Young man, I bring Christmas to all, and that still includes you.”

The son sat next to the wise, old elf, “You know who I lost, and I just want one more chance to say…”

Santa, his eyes now sad and a shake of his head, “There are some gifts I can’t give, even on Christmas Day.”

With a nod and a tear, the son felt his head fall,

But Santa kept on, “That doesn’t mean I have nothing at all.”

“For thirty-four years, she walked you through life,

And she got to spend time with her husband, and you, your daughter, and wife.”

“My boy, over sixty-two times I brought Christmas to her house, and from what I have seen,

From beginning to end, she’d change not a single thing.”

“She was there on your first Christmas, and you and your family there for her last,

But you of all people know she wouldn’t want you to dwell on the past.”

“Now its your turn to pass on those traditions, make Christmas even better!

Give your daughter hot cider, watch all those movies, maybe toss in an ugly sweater.”

With barely a sound, the great figure rose,

He walked to the tree and placed a finger to his nose,

“Son, its ok to cry and to mourn, to have a heavy heart,

Just always remember the most important part:

Christmas is time to remember the good and yes, the bad,

The times that were happy and the ones that are sad.

Whether your loved ones are impossibly far or ever so close,

Hold tight to those memories and people that mattered the most.

A mothers love for her son is a force most potent,

And your mother loved you through that very last moment.”

With gentle snowy-white light, Santa began to glow,

“Now, my boy, I’m afraid I must go.”

With not even a whisper, Santa Clause quickly faded away,

The son was still hurting, but now he was ready for this Christmas Day.

His wife then appeared, hair and clothes ruffled,

“I swear I heard you talking, but it was muffled.”

He laughed and stared, though tired she was beautiful all the same,

“I’ll make some coffee,” they still had to be ready for Christmas fun and games.

The son looked out the window at the warm, golden light of Christmas Day dawn,

As long as her memories were passed down, his Mom would never be truly gone.

For Mom.

1pv5a12,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1pv5a12/i_hate_why_christmas_has_me_so_anxious_this_year/,I hate why Christmas has me so anxious this year,"I posted last month about a shake up in our Christmas tradition now that my ex has a serious girlfriend. 

[Link to Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/s/fHQuBKX2Vl) if interested but the tl:dr is that my ex and I have remained friends since we began coparenting over 10 years ago. While we alternate other holidays, Christmas was always spent with me wrapping gifts while he and kiddo were celebrating Christmas with his parents, crashing on the couch Christmas Eve so we could both be there when our son woke up and then the 3 of us would spend the day together as a family opening presents, watching movies, cooking dinner, etc. Seeing as he's been dating someone for a year and a half now, I let him know I'd be fine with just coming over in the morning as I understood it would be odd. In fact, I offered this last year too after they'd only been dating for half a year and he said nothing or no one would change our tradition since we only have a few years left. Then, he dropped the bomb that his girlfriend isn't comfortable with me and I wouldn't be spending Christmas there. 

After I posted and let some time go by so I could think more rationally, I asked him if I could invite her to coffee so she could get to know me better and he responded, ""She doesn't want to be your friend, She's not like Jane."" (Not her real name, but ""Jane"" is the exgirlfriend of a guy I dated for 5 years in my 20's. A few months after we began dating, he told me he wanted to stay friends with her bc she was part is his friend group. I said that was fine as long as I could meet her. Over 20 years later, Jane and I are still close friends and neither of us talk to our shared ex.) I replied that I don't expect her to be my friend but if he sees a future with her, it'd be nice for us to be cordial opposed to strangers. My son adores her yet she she's avoided his band concert, birthday dinner, etc., all bc I guess of some weird jealousy towards me? Like c'mon girl... he and I called it quits 12 freaking years ago. It was 100% mutual no less. 

Anyway, my ex finally gets to the real reason for the shake up this Christmas... she wants to spend it at her family's so the plan is now that I'll come over Christmas morning to watch our son open his gifts, have breakfast and then he'll come home with me so he can do his girlfriend's thing. I've had zero reason to dislike this woman since they began dating... my son speaks highly of her, she makes my ex happy, she seemed super nice the one time I did meet her, etc. but it's hard not feel negatively about her now after this whole ordeal. 

So now here I am Christmas Eve, wrapping gifts that I'll have to lug over tomorrow to celebrate Christmas morning in a home I'm not really welcomed at, while trying to get everything ready here to ensure Christmas is still special for my son. Ugh. ",2,1766637075.0,breakingmom,2,0.75,False

I've had more than one person get frustrated with me and tell me long after the fact that they were interested, but I was too self conscious + oblivious to do anything about it

Recently bumped into someone I knew 10+ years ago at a book club and the tl;dr is that she asked for my number afterwards, I asked her out for coffee, and we made plans to hang out again this weekend.

I know it's still early on and I still have 0 clue if she is interested in anything non-platonic, but I don't want to potentially miss out on an opportunity by being too reserved and not ""making a move"" after the next few hangouts, assuming things go well. Esp. considering we are both very socially awkward and reserved, and she mentioned panicking after asking for my number lol.

Wondering if people had any tips on how to express interest in a non creepy way when getting to know someone, or particular things that have worked for them, be it subtle flirting, being direct and expressing explicit interest, etc. And similarly any advice on what not to do is always also appreciated, haha

Le Lore:

I love watching terribly bad movies and incredible works of cinema, very few times do I like anything in between! But I used to watch alot of animated content, but not so much anymore.

I love playing jurassic world evolution 3! But would glady play any game with you if we have games in common!

I love gothic literature and science fiction even though I don't have the patience to read more then 30 minutes a day!

I love rock ,60s and Metal, and electric music and even vocaloids (despite being filthy clankers)! I also listen to other genres, especially if they use traditional or folkish music, but those are my main ones!

I love consuming unhealthy amounts of coffee, energy drinks, sodas, and some teas!

I love breathing air, drinking fluids (especially if its caffeine), sleeping on beds, and eating foods!

Warning:
I AM ANTI-CLANKER, DO NOT DM IF YOURE NOT MADE OUT OF FLESH AND BONE >:(



If you feel like we’d get along, send a DM or chat request. Hope you’re having a Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays! 😊 ",0,1766636602.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.5,False
