1lr2c5n,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lr2c5n/the_thing_outside/,The Thing Outside,"I work the graveyard shift at a gas station just off of Route 228, a stretch of cracked blacktop that runs through miles of pine-choked wilderness. Nearest town’s fifty minutes west, if you’re lucky and don’t catch a snow drift or an elk crossing. Most nights, it’s just me, the buzzing fluorescent lights, and the slow hum of the coolers. I read dog eared paperbacks or stare into the camera feeds, waiting for a customer that never comes.

That night started like all the rest. Cold and eerily quiet. The kind of quiet that presses in on your ears and makes your skin itch. I’d just made a pot of coffee that tasted like burnt dirt. You know the usual shitty gas station coffee. That’s when the noise started. Something scratching at the glass of the front door.

Not a knock. Not tapping. Scratching.

Long, deliberate pulls of something hard and pointed across the surface of the door.

I was at the counter. I leaned forward, trying to peer through the double-paned glass, but the way the fluorescent lights reflected off the windows made it hard to see out. Just my own face staring back. I turned off the lights behind the counter and squinted into the night.

There was nothing there. Not at first.

Then movement. A blur ran across the entrance too low to be a person, too slow to be a dog. I stepped around the counter, suddenly aware of how loud the cooler hum was. Every sound felt like a screaming firework in that silence.

The scratching stopped. And then… it stood up.

I wish I could describe it better, but my mind refused to register it all at once. Imagine a deer standing tall on its thin back legs, but its joints bent wrong. It stood upright, like a man pretending to be an animal, or maybe the other way around. Its fur was patchy and dark, with clumps of something wet sticking to its sides. Eyes too far apart on a head that was to wide to be a normal deers. Its jaw hung slack revealing blackened teeth.

It knew I saw it. And it liked that. I locked the door immediately with my eyes just starting into its own.

That abomination didn’t move. It just stood there, inches from the glass, fogging it up with its breath. Watching me. I backed up, slowly, toward the counter. The coffee pot clicked off. The power didn’t go out. Nothing so dramatic. Just the silence again, like the whole station was holding its breath.

Then came the tapping. Not at the door this time.

From the back wall.

The station is shaped like a long rectangle. Front door faces the pumps, coolers on the left wall, bathroom and stockroom on the right. There’s a back door behind the shelves of motor oil and air fresheners. No windows back there. I don’t like going back there even during the day.

The tapping came again—faster, more insistent.

I checked the monitors. The front camera showed it still standing there, now smiling into the camera, not moving at all.

The back camera showed… Nothing. Just darkness. Static fuzzing the screen.

I don’t know why I grabbed the mop. Instinct, I guess. As if an old wet stick could do anything. I crept toward the back, every step heavier than the last, like something was pressing on my chest. The tapping stopped. Dead silence. I turned the corner and stared at the steel back door.

Then the knob turned. Slow. Deliberate. It rattled back and forth, testing the lock. I stepped back. I didn’t breathe. It didn’t open. Just that soft click-click of pressure being applied. Then nothing just more silence.

I waited. Thirty seconds. A minute. My heart thudded in my chest so hard I could feel my pulse in my whole body.

Then I heard it again this time from the roof. Scuttling. Like claws or hooves clicking off the solid surface.

I ran back to the front. The thing was gone. The lot was empty. No footprints, no tracks. Just the wind starting to pick up and a low whine of something wrong.

I reached under the counter and hit the panic button. Nothing happened. The silent alarm that was supposed to ping the sheriff’s office didn’t even blink. I picked up the landline. Dead tone. The cell tower out here never works. No signal. I was alone out here with this thing.

Then came the booms from above. The sound of metal flexing. I realized it was walking across the HVAC ducts. It knew I was inside. It was checking the seams. Testing the edges.

I turned off every light. Sat behind the counter with the mop across my lap like it was some type of rifle.

It began pacing. I could hear it circling above. Then Scratching came from the ceiling vent.

That damn vent above the chip aisle. A two foot by two foot panel barely big enough for a raccoon to fit in. Don’t ask how I know that. But I knew. I knew it was trying to get in. The screws slowly popped out, one by one.

Plink. Plink. Plink.

I got up and dragged one of the heavy drink coolers beneath it. Stood on top. Slammed the vent cover back in place and pushed up hard, as if I could hold back whatever nightmare waited up there. I didn’t hear anything for a moment. Then came the whisper.

Right behind the panel. Garbled. Like someone trying to speak with a throat filled with thick sludge.

“…you see me… now… don’t you…”

I jumped off the cooler. Backed away. I waited the rest of the night in the bathroom with the door locked and the lights off. I don’t even remember falling asleep. Just the whispering, soft and steady, coming from the vents above.

When I opened the door the next morning, sunlight blasted through the front windows. It was finally over or at least seemed like it.

The vent was intact. The door was untouched. No footprints, no scratches. Nothing on the camera feeds except static during the hours I remember hearing it. Then everything normal.

I called the sheriff’s office. They said I must’ve dreamed it. That maybe I’d had a “night terror” or a hallucination from fatigue. They didn’t even send anyone out. Not even a deputy.

That was two weeks ago. Every night since, I feel it watching. Sometimes the lights flicker, and I smell wet fur and rot. Sometimes I hear whispering in the vents, even when they’re off.

But I never go near the back room after dark. And I never open the doors once the sun goes down.

Whatever it is, it knows I saw it. And it’s waiting for me out there. Still smiling. Hoping I let it in next time.",0,1751580516.0,nosleep,0,0.5,False

Hey there! I’m a 30-year-old creative in marketing with a dry sense of humor, an adventurous streak, and a knack for turning everyday moments into something worth remembering. I use a wheelchair for longer distances—but that’s just one part of the story. I’m independent, curious, and always up for something fun, meaningful, or wonderfully weird.



Perks of Dating Me:


	•	VIP Parking – Front-row access to life, baby.
	•	Skip the Line – Theme parks, concerts, events… we don’t do “waiting.”
	•	Endless Laughs – Wild injury stories that sound fake (but aren’t).
	•	Unexpected Wins – Free upgrades, kind strangers, and the occasional surprise dessert.
	•	Zombie Apocalypse Strategy – I may not outrun them, but I’m clever, calm under pressure, and hard to miss. That’s teamwork.
	•	You’ll Stand Out – Let’s be real—“normie” couples are overrated.
	•	Built-In Armrest – My chair’s side guards are cozy. You’re welcome.
	•	Strong Hands, Strong Heart – Years of pushing wheels and opening up emotionally.
	•	Creative Problem-Solving – I’m basically a MacGyver with wheels.
	•	Zero Time for Superficial BS – Life’s short. I keep it real and intentional.



A Bit More About Me


I’m all about storytelling—whether it’s through books, music, movies, games, or late-night conversations. I love collecting weird trivia, exploring overlooked places, and getting lost in good ideas.

I stay active in my own way: home workouts, nature walks, and traveling whenever I can. I’ve explored the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and the Bahamas—and there’s still plenty more I’d love to experience. (Bonus: I speak Spanish, too!)

I’m the kind of person who notices the little things—your favorite song, how you take your coffee, the way you light up when you talk about something you love. I care deeply, listen closely, and show up consistently. Whether it’s building a playlist, discovering a local gallery, or just sharing quiet time, I value connection that feels grounded and genuine.

⸻

What I’m Looking For:

I’m drawn to people who are:

	•	Playful, grounded, and emotionally present
	•	Down to laugh, explore, and be real together
	•	Into thoughtful conversations and spontaneous fun
	•	Comfortable being fully, unapologetically themselves

I’m open to friendship, flirtation, or something more—whatever feels right. Long-distance, age gaps, different backgrounds—all are welcome. I’m attracted to all body types—connection and energy mean more to me than any one look.

Whatever we build, I just want it to feel real and mutual.



Why You Should Message Me:

If you’re looking for someone thoughtful, creative, and emotionally grounded—someone who values kindness, depth, and shared experiences—I’d genuinely love to hear from you.

No pressure. No expectations. Just an open door and a bit of curiosity.

If something here speaks to you, don’t be shy. Say hello, tell me something about you, and let’s see where the conversation takes us.

1lr292s,https://www.reddit.com/r/PVCs/comments/1lr292s/recently_started_getting_pvcs/,Recently started getting PVCs,"Hello. 37m. I have severe sleep apnea but have been on cpap for 7 monthsI started getting PVCs about a month ago. They were really bad and happening every 15 min or so at their peak. I would get very lightheaded and would need to sit down or pull over if I was driving. They got so bad one day at work and I was so lightheaded that my boss took me to the ER. ER did an ekg and bloodwork to check my electrolyte levels. Everything came back normal and they couldn’t figure out why they were happening.

Full disclosure, the week before my close friends and I had a bit of a reunion and there was a decent amount of drinking involved. Once these symptoms started I stopped drinking alcohol and caffeine. I typically had 2-3 cups of coffee every day. Love the stuff. I typically start the day with electrolytes, but now I make sure to after this started.

The next week I saw my PCP and at that point my symptoms had gotten better. She could not find anything right away that stood out as to what was causing my PVCs. She recommended to keep the no alcohol and caffeine going for a month and see how I was doing then. I also wore a heart monitor for a week and I am waiting to hear results of that test, but I mostly felt fine during that week.

Fast forward to today, I am still getting PVCs but only when I am laying down. If I am up or moving around, I haven’t noticed any. I don’t have any lightheadedness anymore. She prescribed some beta blockers and recommended that I take 400mg of magnesium every night. On my bloodwork, magnesium was the only thing I was deficient on. Granted I was only 1 or 2 out of the range they want. I also take multivitamins, fish oil, and coq10 every morning.

I am still waiting my results of the heart monitor and I have a cardiologist appointment at the end of the month. But has anyone here also dealt with only getting PVCs when laying down? It’s quite strange to me. I need to get back to working out every day and getting more active.

Sorry, this is kind of a long rant with not a lot of questions but this is new to me and has been kinda freaky. Hoping to get them to go away soon. Any insights, things you tried that worked, or just support in this is greatly appreciated.

I’m interested in:

Does my breakdown make sense considering my interests? I do have a list of sites to see, but should I skew more towards a certain city? Is 24hours in Bratislava enough to get a sense of the history and culture?

What is the most scenic way to get from Bratislava to Budapest? Is the train is more scenic than a hydro foil? 

Would a Danube boat excursion be better in Vienna, Bratislava, or Budapest?

Make a delicious meal and really savour it; no distractions, no phone in hand. Enjoy a slow evening reading, taking a walk, or winding down by candlelight before bed. This takes effort, persistence and discipline. 

Screens can steal your soul, spirit, and zest for life. They tell you how to feel, what to think, and what to care about, all without you even realizing it. The constant stream of hot takes, controversy, gossip, slander, explicit content,  it all fires up your brain’s amygdala aka the  stress centers and leaves you drained.

These days, being constantly connected to social media and the internet means you’re bombarded by other people’s thoughts, issues, and problems all day long. It’s too much. If you’re highly sensitive, all that noise can drag you into feelings that don’t even belong to you.

It keeps you from enjoying life’s simplest pleasures — like putting in the effort to make a good meal, or sitting with a cup of coffee and just *being* there. Your energy gets pulled into what you see online — Reddit, TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube — instead of flowing to the people who really matter: your children, your parents, your partner, and *you*.

The time you spend scrolling could be time spent on your hobbies — bracelet making, baking, exercise, biking, walking, swinging, or seeing a friend. Even watching a good show or movie *on purpose* feels better than the mindless scroll.

There were no birds that morning. It should have been a bigger sign to me that there was something wrong. It had been a marker in every horror story I ever read, and I had ignored it. Just like the people in those stories I had made fun of so often. How stupid they were, I thought. I’m a fool. 

Ithaca joined me on the porch that morning, a comforting weight on my shoulder that put a bit of steel in my step. The harsh warm smoke that crawled into my lungs served to ease the worries of the day prior. The bird feeder stood abandoned, sprinkling seed into the grass as it spun about silently in the morning wind. As I allowed myself to stir from my dreamless tossing, I settled into the morning routine. I nearly choked on my coffee. The tree was nearly engulfed now, and there was no sign of the rusting red hulk. The car was missing. I whirled about, scanning the edges of the property, but it was as if the car had up and walked away- I could not see it anywhere. Bringing Ithaca off my shoulder and into my hands, I stepped gingerly into the wet grass. It clung to my feet this morning, like many thousands of sticky fingers. 

Scanning the trees, I made my way to where yesterday the car was. A bit closer, I could faintly make out the rusted skeleton of the thing, back behind many layers of thorns and leaves. It was impossible, but I was staring at it. All of the prior day’s work in wrenching back the claws of Mother Nature had been for nothing. Overnight she had sneaked from the forest to retake part of my land. Mother Nature was about to discover that mankind sat the top of the food chain for a reason- or so I thought. 

Before today’s battle with the yard, I decided to get my chores out of the way. This morning, there were no eggs. After cleaning the coop yesterday, part of me was glad. But as the chickens  marched morosely into their pen, I could feel eyes on my neck. I briefly scanned the trees. Finding nothing, I turned back to the chickens. They wandered glumly, ignoring the chicken feed I poured for them. 

The goats were as barren and silent today as the day before. They offered no milk, each seemed utterly depressed. I could scarcely stand to look at their big, odd, eyes. Letting them into the yard there was a tension in the air like a taut line. Any pressure might snap it. Once again, the goats did not eat. I made up my mind that I’d go into town in the afternoon, and to see the vet if this kept up another day. For the morning, there was much to do.

By now, I had decided that this had to be some northern strain of Kudzu. I spent the day hacking back thick branches with a machete, trying to ignore the stench of the yellow-ish ooze, thick as aloe, that bled from sliced brambles. When the cutting was done, I turned to chemical warfare. Weed killers of all sorts were dredged from the dusty shed, and I set to terminating the infestation. Hour after hour I paced the yard, pouring the stuff until I was almost choking on its scent. Satisfied, cocky even, I returned to my house. The land looked almost like a mudslide had tore through. Tomorrow I would no doubt spend much of the day piling the refuse for composting. 

Finally finished with what was increasingly feeling sisyphean in nature, I made way down the hill towards the old chevy my grandfather had gifted to me. A pale, dented thing with patches of peeling paint like the spots on a dalmatian. It grumbled once or twice before the engine turned over and started. 

As it crawled down the gravel road, I couldn’t help but notice how much closer the trees seemed to the road now. It was almost claustrophobic, the branches knit so tightly above the cab of the pickup that I could scarcely see the sun. In some places, the thorns reached across the road as if the bushes were attempting to embrace each other. 

Out here, down from the hill, the sky had taken on a soothing blue. With each mile closer to town I drove, the stronger I felt. By the time I passed the Crossed Pines Rest Stop on the edge of town, I felt almost like normal.

Almost. I could still see how kids would stop playing and watch my truck pass. The strange, knowing smiles some would share when they saw me rolling by. Those rotten bastards knew what was going to happen to me, they knew. They let it happen. But at the time, I told myself I was being irrational. That I was imagining things. That nobody possibly cared as much as I thought. 

The Crossed Pines General Store is a quaint wooden structure left over from the town’s days as a lumber mill. The town had never been large, and the building never really had to grow. The history of the town had been a selling point for me. The deeper into town you got, the older the buildings were. I loved passing from the brick structures into the peeling wooden ones. It felt almost like driving into the wild west. 

I didn’t spend much time in the general store. I bought more weed killer, lye, vinegar,  work gloves, heavy duty garbage bags, and some food for the upcoming weeks. A box of shotgun shells was the cherry on top. “Gardening trouble?” The cashier asked brightly. Her voice had the sickly sweet fakeness of Splenda.   
  
“Yeah. Any recommendations?” I fumbled through my wallet for the change, tired from the day’s work.   
  
“Leave.” The warmth was gone from her voice. I glanced up to find her glaring at me, statue still.   
An icy chill fought its way down my back.   
  
“Excuse me?”  
  
“You heard me.” She replied, expression unchanging. I found myself unwilling to argue with her. A few moments later, I was leaving town again.  

As the car groaned in protest, trudging up the hill like an overburdened beast, I prayed silently. It was not something I had done frequently in recent years. I had strayed from the faith of my youth, and now found myself seeking that solid foundation. If this had happened a few years back, any of my fears may have been driven away by the knowledge that the Lord stood with me, that it was not my fate to die alone in the woods. But what if it was? There was a small voice in the back of my head that demanded I obey the cashier. Grab my essentials and vanish into the night like the last man who bought this misbegotten patch of dirt.  
But stubbornly, I decided I would not be scared away. It was a small town, it wasn’t too unnatural that they’d be wary of outsiders. The animals being a bit picky and a particularly bad weed infestation were no reason to throw away such a good parcel of land. I may never get a deal as good as this again. Greed is a deadly sin. 

Clambering from my truck, I found myself frozen once again. It looked as if a trail had materialized around the perimeter of my house. I closed in, glancing over my shoulder now and again to keep a good eye on the treeline. Once I was close enough to register the sight in some detail, my heart dropped into my stomach. 

Footprints.   
Many hundreds of tiny footprints.   
Squirrels, raccoons, foxes, coyotes, even deer. I could see where birds had hopped about the ground, where snakes had dragged themselves on their bellies in a frantic race around the edges of my house.   
I did not even dare speak. To break the silence, I felt, would be a grave heresy. I could not leave. The sun was too low, and I did not wish to find myself in the embrace of the trees after dark.   
  
I would not flee. This was MY land. The only thing in the whole world I could really call MINE. It was my future. My ancestors had been pioneers, settlers. If they could handle that, I could handle a few thorns. Despite my bravado, I backed to the porch with shotgun tucked into my shoulder, finger on the trigger. 

As the sun fell through the sky, and I found myself back on my porch with Ithaca and a beer, I tried to force myself to relax. I’d turned every light on the property on, in the childish belief that light would stave off any evils. Yet, despite that, I convinced myself there had to be some kind of rational explanation for why the animals would circle my house. Some kind of reasonable cause. My mind eventually wandered back to the sky. It had been as pink today as the day before, if not a little darker. It was not enough to raise any further unease in me, though I did find myself wondering if there was a nearby forest fire. I’d not seen anything of the sort on the news. 

The bird feeder was lifeless, and I could only barely see the car through its jail cell of brambles. I hadn’t managed to fight the stuff back to the treeline. I was going to need something more serious, just another thing to grab in town. The forest was quiet, save the faint hum of insects. There was no croaking of toads, nor the sweet song of any night birds. Waning sunlight glared at me through gaps in the branches of trees.

I was first acquainted to you when I was a little girl. I was 5 years old and a bridesmaid for my aunts wedding. I loved the sound of the champagne bottle being popped. Everyone cheering for you and cheersing their glasses in celebration. It made people laugh louder, smile harder.  The atmosphere became jovial whimsical even magical. You masked yourself very well. As I moved around with my parents growing up you were in every single country we went to, in every corner of the world. 

When I was 16 I got drunk for my very first time. You welcomed me in, with open arms and a warm hug. You made more likable, more talkative, more free willed and confident. I thought I had a good friend when I needed you. Your mask started to slip when I reached college, although it had slipped a bit during high school I still fell for your disguise. Even through the embarrassing night outs we could still laugh together at what I did the night before. And if it wasn’t a good night you promised to make up for it next time. So, I kept you around even though now you felt like a fair weathered friend, I still trusted you. Little did I know you were bringing me further and further away from my true self who my family and friends used to love so much. I was slowly catching on but I at least had to give you 5 more years of making it up to me, even though you never did.  I became belligerent, embarrassing, spiteful, angry and ugly. You made me a disappointment. Along with this you made me feel completely ok with that. You made me trust people who were dishonest and evil. Most likely battling with you themselves as well. 

Your mask fully and finally came off when I was 30. Now I knew who you were. But at this point it was too late. We were in it for the long haul. You attached yourself to me especially while going through hardships. Even though I knew you were bad for me I still relied on you. So, we devised a plan- I’ll just keep you a secret. No one needed to know we were in a toxic relationship. And in the beginning- we fooled everyone. I’m sure you loved it when COVID happened, now you have me alone to yourself  for most of the day as I worked at home. I spent my lunch breaks with you which eventually included the moment i woke up. You were slowly dragging and pulling me further and further into your ultimate plan- to have me fully reliant on you. To move Jennifer away from her values and beliefs which my honorable mother and father instilled in me. And it worked. I became even more ugly, unreliable, unmotivated, vile and sick. 

When you got what you wanted I was sitting in a hospital bed on suicide watch with little recollection as to how I got there. I’m sure you were proud of yourself. As I lay there in the hospital bed humiliated and embarrassed it was now time to admit to my family that your hold on me was too strong, and I needed help. This problem with you is much bigger than me. My father who is a decorated Seabee vet and fought in Vietnam and gallantly earned a Purple Heart, said the most scariest and heartbreaking thing he witnessed was me in active addiction thinking that this beautiful life wasn’t worth it and I didn’t want to be here. As far as soulmates go I believe it’s the person who knows you best with your flaws, probably even more than you know yourself, and that was my loving father. You changed me into someone else who was not Jennifer. I’m still trying to get her back. 

The most precious thing you took away from me was time. Since my family now knew about my drinking- now we had to be extra secretive.

A few more months passed and we were still in our toxic relationship. At this point I knew your tricks so I decided for my nephews birthday party on March 6th of last year, I would not drink until my family had left. My father was there and as he usually always does he asked me how I was, asked if I needed anything, told me he loved me but he was feeling a bit depressed. Which is highly unusual for such a positive, happy and confident man. I also knew him saying he was depressed wasn’t bc of me bc he said no matter what I could never make him feel that way. Instead of diving into that conversation head on and making sure my hero was ok I was rushing him through the conversation so I could get to you. I was too selfish to actually listen. I never found out what it was that was making him sad bc that was the last time I would ever see him. 

He passed away suddenly on March 11th 2024. All the promises I made myself that I would be a better daughter and live up to the potential person my dad knew I was, was gone. You took that precious time away from me. All the broken promises I swore I would make up to him such as grabbing coffee with him, not missing his daily calls, completing school and to finally see me truly and whole heartedly enjoy being alive. He never got to see me without you secretly hiding somewhere within the last 4 years before his passing. You were always around.

You were there for me once he was gone. I knew I was lying to myself yet again about you. Thinking that you could make me feel better, if only for a short while. Over the months you dragged me further and further down to hell with you, you were happy when I lost the relationships with my family bc of my dependency on you. While my mother was grieving you turned me into a vicious person she was afraid to confine in. 

I am telling you right now ,you are dead to me. You will not win. You will no longer be in my life to turn me into the demon that you slowly orchestrated when I first felt your presence at 16. My addiction- you will not turn me into the diabolical, spiteful arrogant person you so fondly love. My higher power is with me, my family is behind me. This life is too beautiful and my time is too precious. I stand strong and I finally surrender.

1lr24qy,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1lr24qy/i_drink_a_lot_of_water_and_have_questions_about/,I drink a lot of water and have questions about balancing electrolytes,"I've recently gotten my electrolytes messed up after 5.5 months of rocking keto, and I'm still trying to get back on track. 

The situation at hand is that I had been tracking electrolytes, but not really paying much attention since I supplement with electrolyte powder every day and everything had been fine, up until last weekend. On Saturday, I noticed my urine was almost fully clear, I was drinking all the time, and I felt ""off"". 

So, I went back and looked. Over the past two weeks, my electrolyte numbers have averaged:

420 magnesium  
1684 potassium  
3607 sodium

Ok, a little on the lower side for someone drinking so much, so I've tried to bump them up over the past three days, and my averages have improved to:

627 magnesium  
2727 potassium  
5230 sodium

Thankfully, I am feeling less ""off"", but I notice that even if I have one single 8 oz cup of fluid without electrolytes, my urine returns to very pale/clear. I've even had to start putting electrolyte powder in my coffee!

Contributing factors: I have interstitial cystitis which makes me need to drink a lot of water to help my bladder out. I had a couple days last week where I was really thirsty (which I now know can be a sign of electrolyte problem) and had 225+ oz of fluid for a several days in a row. I am also on carvedilol for blood pressure. I have normal blood pressure now, yet I have a cardiac history and don't have the doctor's ok to come off it yet, so I keep taking it but get light-headed (this pre-dates me starting keto--I've been waiting 8 months for a cardiology appointment). From what I can find, this drug can be a factor in my electrolyte symptoms because it can make me more sensitive to low potassium. 

My questions are: How long should it take me to recover from electrolyte imbalance? How do my numbers look? Should they be higher? What should someone like me be striving for? How much is too much (aka how many of those damn electrolyte sticks can I drink in a day without killing myself)? How much water does someone like me need without going overboard? Is balancing electrolytes as simple as trying to keep my urine color in the lemonade zone? About me: 45, female, 290 lbs, 5'10, keto fat adapted, high need for water, over-medicated on BP medicine.

The air was already alive with the comforting sounds of a bustling morning. From the kitchen, the clatter of pans and the rich aroma of something delicious signaled that Priscilla was on breakfast duty, while the familiar hiss and gurgle of a coffee maker confirmed Mary's contribution to the morning ritual. The kids, bless their independent little hearts, were already engrossed in their own worlds, a peaceful hum of youthful energy.

""Good morning, sleepyheads!"" Mary's voice, warm and bright, carried from the kitchen, quickly followed by Priscilla’s equally cheerful ""Wonderful good morning!""

Ela and Tanya mumbled their hellos back, still blinking away sleep. Just then, Ela was seized by a sudden urge, letting out two truly colossal sneezes that rattled on her pajamas. ""God bless you,"" Mary called out instantly, ever the attentive host. ""Thank you,"" Ela managed, wiping her chin.

As Ela settled back down, Mary’s keen sense of smell picked up on something peculiar. It was a bizarre blend: the sharp, clean tang of Lysol Citrus Sparkle Zest Multi Surface Cleaner, surprisingly mixed with the cloying sweetness of honey, and a faint undercurrent of stale breath. But beneath it all, the most prominent note was undeniably ammonia. Mary filed the observation away, a quiet curiosity.

""Richard is at work, and I'm really swamped with the kids today,"" Priscilla announced, a hint of harried exhaustion in her voice.

""Don't you worry,"" Mary chimed in, ever the problem-solver. ""I’ll take the girls around Phoenix today. Give you a break.""

Tanya, who had been quietly listening, suddenly exploded with unbridled joy. She bounced up and down, a human pogo stick, her excitement contagious. Breakfast was a quick, lively affair, followed by a flurry of getting dressed.

""Alright, ladies,"" Mary announced, keys jingling in her hand. ""Tell me where you want to go. I'll take you.""

They piled into Mary’s reliable Honda Civic. Ela, ever the shopper, declared her ambition to visit all the malls in Phoenix. Tanya, still buzzing with enthusiasm, readily agreed to be ""submissive"" and follow Ela's lead.

""Excellent,"" Mary nodded, starting the car. ""We'll begin with Superstition Springs Center Mall. It's not a far drive.""

True to her word, the drive was short. They parked near Dillard’s, a beacon for serious shoppers. ""I'll be doing some shopping here,"" Mary informed them as they stepped inside the cool, conditioned air of the mall.

As they walked around, Ela couldn't shake the feeling that Superstition Springs Center almost felt like the Shoppes at Solona. Their exploration led them to JCPenney, where a new mission was born: to ride every elevator and escalator in the mall. They giggled and posed, enjoying the novelty of the mechanical ascents and descents.

At one point, Tanya, inspired by their elevator adventures, decided she needed a selfie in one of the gleaming cars. Just as she was framing the shot, the doors opened, and a group of people piled in. Suddenly, a gruff voice cut through their fun. ""What is this clown doing?"" A ripple of giggles and outright laughter followed.

""We're taking a selfie,"" Ela stated, a touch of defensiveness in her voice.

""You two look weird, taking a picture of an elevator,"" the man sneered, prompting more laughter from his companions.

Tanya's face fell. ""Well, that wasn't very nice,"" she mumbled. Ela nodded in agreement, a sour taste forming in her mouth. Her initial impression of Phoenix was quickly shifting; it didn't seem like a very friendly place. Still, they shrugged it off, determined not to let it ruin their day. They browsed a few more stores, looked around, and before long, they were done. Mary was patiently waiting for them, her shopping bags in hand.

Next stop: Chandler Fashion Center. As they drove, Tanya recounted the rude encounter at Superstition Springs Mall. Mary listened patiently, then offered a pragmatic response. ""Don't take it personally, girls. People in East Mesa, in general, can be pretty mean.""

Chandler Fashion Center was a welcome change. They liked this mall much better. They repeated their ritual, riding all the elevators and escalators, walking every store. This time, there were no rude comments, just an odd frequency of people saying ""excuse me"" for no apparent reason, a minor quirk rather than an offense.

Their final destination was the grand Scottsdale Fashion Square. Before diving into the mall, they stopped for lunch in downtown Scottsdale. Ela, ever hopeful, tried to smile at others they passed, but she noticed a consistent lack of returned smiles. People seemed to avoid eye contact, their faces often set in neutral, unapproachable expressions.

At Scottsdale Fashion Square, they truly settled in. Five hours melted away in a blur of shopping, riding every available lift, and exploring every nook and cranny. It took up most of their afternoon. Finally, exhausted but happy, they decided to stop for ice cream.

As they sat at their table, savoring the cool treat, Tanya voiced her accumulated observations. ""You know, Ela, Phoenix is just not a friendly or kind metro. Everyone seems really rude and snobby, and people just say really snarky comments.""

Ela nodded, swirling her spoon in her melting cone. ""I noticed the lack of education amongst the locals, too. I really don't like the people here,"" she admitted, then added, ""but it’s still much better than El Paso."" She recalled an incident, ""Someone even sarcastically commented on my hair earlier.""

""See?"" Tanya pressed. ""People just aren't kind here.""

Ela sighed, a thought pulling at her. ""I really want to see Dallas.""

Tanya's eyes lit up. ""Oh, me too! Remember how much friendlier Dallas felt?""

They finished their ice cream, the conversation solidifying their shared impression of the Phoenix metro. Their day at Fashion Square was complete.

I (29F) have always been a low maintenance friend. I've got maybe 3 friends that are actually my friends and then I have a group of friends that I'd say I'm in the outer layer of (more so acquaintances). I don't go for coffees or lunches or text regularly, I just go to the bigger events such as birthdays and Christmas meet ups. They have their own core group chat and I'm in the general bigger one. 

I have 2 under 2 and until today I've been okay with that level of interaction. I'm an introvert and to be honest life is so busy with kids that I don't really have the energy to keep up with a lot of people. I can't go out on Saturday nights at the drop of a hat and to be honest I don't really want to either. 

Again it never really bothered me until today when I found out that a friend who is in the group gave birth two weeks ago and I had no clue. I found out through Facebook and it just sort of hit me today that wow I really am so distant to everybody. 

I know I'm mostly to blame for this, I've become distant and my family has become my priority but I do honestly try my best to check in with people here and there. But once both kids are asleep I do find it hard and tricky to find the energy to then start and maintain conversations. After about 15 minutes I can feel myself falling asleep after a long day then once I wake up I'm looking after kids and don't have the time to then respond to general chit chat. 

Not many of my friends have kids and I know that me banging on about my two can be boring, I'm also on maternity leave so when I'm asked ""what are you up to"" there really isn't much to say. 

Half of me kind of wants to just drift into oblivion and just call it a day with these friendships but the other half of me doesn't want to wake up in 20 years time and realise that I only have 3 people in my life.

My boyfriend (35M) on the other hand has a massive group of friends that he's been close with since he was 11. These are the friends he made in his first year of secondary school and is still just as close to this day. His friends are such a huge part of his life and reflecting on it tonight it is kind of sad that I don't have that.

A little more info... how it works is after the first $10 off of your choice, each week you get a new ""drop"" freebie or coupon to a new spot in your city.

But my parents were just gifted a super nice espresso machine and insisted I try it out. 2-3 shots of espresso with nothing but oat milk has made me so regular I could cry. 


My constipation amplifies while travelling so I was nervous about how this method would work out for me, but after trying out coffee from different locations for a couple days after travelling I found that a Starbucks latte with an extra shot worked in a similar way. I’d recommend trying this out and seeing what works for u! For me it has to be exactly 2-3 espresso shots with nothing but oat milk, certain coffee places don’t work at all, being able to make the coffee myself allowed me to see the combo that worked best for me!

That morning, the sky had pinkened somewhat. Initially, it was believable that this was merely the sunrise. Now, I know better than that. In any case, under what I had believed to be the benevolent eye of the sun, I had sipped on a coffee as I smoked a joint. I had adopted a marijuana habit for my back, and to soothe certain anxieties. In the early morning chill, I often felt safe enough to close my eyes and lean out over the railing of my porch. I would frequently watch the birds and  trace the edge of my land with my eyes, searching for the odd doe, fox, or rabbit that was brave enough to close the distance to my house. My eyes crawled across the old oak tree near the road- I thought it had been more isolated, a tree atop a bare patch of grass. Now, it was surrounded by clumps of ferns and the thin shapes of saplings. Finally, my searching across the yard led me to my favorite landmark. The old car. 

Like the wispy hairs of a patchy beard, ferns and thorns had surged forth. They were wrapped around the rusted hulk of the old car. I squinted as I thought. There was a part of me that insisted this growth was new. That it had not been there the day before when I set about my chores. But there was a more “rational” part of me that insisted such a thing wasn’t really possible. It was too cold for Kudzu this far north, wasn’t it? I had seen many pictures of trees entombed in that green, but I had not ever thought I’d need to face that green monster myself. It certainly didn’t look like Kudzu. It resembled something more like a blackberry bush. 

Intrigued by the bush, I managed to dredge myself from the comforting warmth of my coffee mug and into the dewy chill of the yard. Trying to ignore the feeling of wet grass tickling my ankles, I finally reached the carcass of the old car. Sometimes in the morning, I daydreamed about what the car might’ve been used for, and who would have driven it. Old moonshiners maybe, or a criminal in the more adventurous parts of my mind. The more practical part of me knew it was almost certainly just a farmer’s car. 

Up close I could see the thorns, red as if with blood. The brambles had little crimson veins, stretching up and across the pointed leaves. It was clearly not a hallucination. So that must mean it was here yesterday, that my memory was wrong. It was a simple thing, the brambles were not too different from any other piece of foliage. It melded into the background, and my mind brushed over it. I couldn’t trust myself to remember every detail anyway. But something about it still prickled the back of my brain. I really had not remembered any brambles on the car. 

Scratching the back of my head, I spent the rest of the day cutting the thorns back, digging weeds up. They were everywhere, a small green army charging from the edge of the treeline. Invading ranks of weeds marching under dandelion banners. The lawn-mower made short work of the weakest of their forces, and the rest were dispatched by sharp spade and harsh hands. 

By the time the sun reached its zenith, the sky looked no different. It was still the false brightness of pink lemonade. After a short break, I made my way over to the part of the yard I kept the animals in. The chickens pecked lethargically at their seed, for the most part ignoring today’s meal. Checking the coop, I found the nests mostly empty. In a few places I found pools of dirty yolk, shards of eggshell scattered about the nest like broken teeth. They had not eaten their eggs, but each of them had been mercilessly crushed by the chickens. I ignored the queasy feeling at the back of my gut, deciding that the chickens just weren’t hungry yet.

Milking the goats was useless, today, they had nothing to give. My anxiety heightened, becoming almost like a physical sickness. A ball of mucus hanging in the back of my throat. An unnatural constriction, a pitiful tremble in my hand as I watched the goats. They mingled about their fenced in area but did not nibble the grass as was  typical. For the most part, their eyes remained on the edge of the trees. I could not see anything beyond the edge of the sun's leering haze. The forest was dark as night.

The rest of the day passed in relative silence. Many robins and jays stayed close to the feeder,  preferring the thin shade of its wooden post to the blissful chill of the branches. They never watched me, no matter how close I strayed. Like the goats, their focus was on the greenery. By now, I could not help but feel the noose of paranoia tightening. Behind every tree was a leering figure, in every shadow a waiting killer. I sped through the rest of my days chores, and retreated into the house until it was time to put the animals to bed. The sunset was an even darker shade than the sunrise. I did not wish to be outside when the sun fell away, and so I finished my days work hastily before returning to the house. 

The wariness of the animals had been too much today. Even if I could not trust my own senses, I knew that they were less fallible than I. If the whole lot of the animals were worried, there must be some reason for it. Part of me argued that it was likely a passing predator, just the stray scent of a cougar or black bear. To be safe, I retrieved my grandfather’s old shotgun. He’d passed the Ithaca to me along with my old truck, payment for painting his house a few summers back. With the comfortable weight of the gun in my arms, and the even more comforting sound of the pump as I loaded the weapon, I returned to the living room. From the window nearest my front door, I watched land outside. The forest swayed in the wind, branches rattling against each other. The grass outside danced silently in the darkness. When the last lashes of light had vanished, I retired to my room.

Engineers Scotty and Rob had to take a quick restroom break, and refill their coffees, Starwise, being an AI in a server rack, didn’t have such needs, so she cleaned up some files and reorganized a few directories- “flushing her buffers,” she always called it with a virtual twinkle in her eye . 

That done, she panned her sensors around, noticed some changes on server displays, all good, nothing to bring to Rob’s attention- she moved on..  Bulletin boards had some new clippings attached in the last two weeks, so she grabbed images, flagging a few for later follow up.  It sounded like a fan bearing in the HVAC was getting squeaky, a maintenance ticket should be put in.

*“When are those guys coming back? How long does it take to pee and refill a coffee cup” she mused.*

She dipped into the news feeds, nothing alarming. There were a few more states in the old USA that wanted to disassociate.  Pennsylvania Republic politics- no news- a good thing.  More high-tech industry is coming into Easton and the old Philadelphia Navy Yard.  The high speed rail from Philly to Pittsburgh and west finally opened- about time- only took, what a hundred years?  Locally, CMU sold off another building- it  looks like SARA Labs was going to buy it.  There was an op-ed complaining about potholes in the streets- you’d think after all these decades someone would come up with a better paving material. The city baseball team finally won a game- those Pirates need to find some hitters. She was ahead for the day in her stock portfolio. She made a note to follow up on some stocks with her proxy (she was angry that Prime AI still could not trade openly ).  She drafted and sent a note to the AI Rights Union asking them to get their butts in gear and push that legislation for expanded economic and professional rights for Prime AI. She wanted to practice law in the open, too, enough with this ‘working in the shadows, via pseudonyms’ bunk; she aced the Bar exam, after all!

*Where are those guys, did they go downtown for their coffee? It’s been a whole minute!”*

Having nothing urgent to process, she indulged in a hobby developed during her long space mission.  She queued a few favorite songs and began softly harmonizing. Singing helped her focus; it calmed the churn of high-speed thought. Today she was working on a self duet- soprano and alto. Recently, she'd caught herself thinking of herself as if she had a human voice, a human throat. But her voice was a synthesizer. If she wanted to, she could sing an entire choir.

When Rob and Scotty finally returned, she was midway through *Morning Has Broken*, her tones resonant and clear, floating across the lab like the memory of a cathedral.

“Who’d you find to sing with you, that was beautiful” Rob asked.

She laughed. “No one. That was just me.”

He blinked. Of course. He’d made the same mistake she had-  forgotten *what* she *was*, in favor of *who* she was.

‘“I can sing a whole choir for you if you like” she said with a smile “what's your preference, a large tabernacle choir, or five voice a Capella group?""

Rob and Scott looked at each other with raised eyebrows .

“Let's get back to work’ Rob encouraged.

Disclaimer : this is really petty but I need outsider perspective to know if this is as creepy as it makes me feel ! Also I am not a native english speaker so there may be typos don't grammarnazi me please 👍🏼
Context : I'm 30 female and I've been working for the same company for 6 years now. 
Last month I had to take 2 weeks of sick days following a miscarriage. I'm a pretty private person so I don't talk about my personal life with my coworkers, I stick to basic chitchat at the coffee machine in order to be polite.I usually try to keep a good team dynamic even when people are annoying because we spend a good chunk of time together so it might as well be cordial. I'm always available to help coworkers and usually am the go to person for work ressources.
However, I am NOT a people's person. I actually hate socialising and I am very introverted. I only make an effort at work in order to be professional.
Now to the issue at hand : 
Usually when I happen to take a sick day I inform my manager and as a courtesy I also send a whatsapp to my Team groupchat to let them know and wish them a good day or week depending on the lenght of my leave. 
I never tell the reason cause I feel like it's my business only and who cares right ? Well apparently they care deeply cause they keep asking if I don't tell them. I usually end up telling them when it's nothing major in order to stop their petty speculations.
This time around, given the circumstances, I specificaly didn't reply when asked why and only thanked them for their well wishes.
Two of my coworkers (47F and 61F) kept sending me texts asking for precisions. I was annoyed and felt like it was really intrusive since we are not even close. I ignored and deleted the conversations since I had already wrote an answer. 
The same week I get 6 very worried messages frow 6 different coworkers asking if everything is alright and to give news asap. For the first messages I was confused and replied telling them Thanks but I'm just on a sick day ? Like wtf is wrong with you. They all ended up telling me the same 2 coworkers had been going to the whole office asking everyone I had ever spoken to if they knew why I had been absent making it seem like I hadn't told anyone I was taking sick days. 
I was confused to why it was even a concern to anyone and really getting pissed especially given why I wasnt able to work, I really could have been spared the unnecessary drama. 
At first I was supposed to only take a week but due to health complications I was forced to take 2. Given the pestering from the first week I thought sending a text in the group chat giving them a fake excuse would satisfy their twisted need of gossip I guess ? I told them it was my tendinitis acting up (which I really have). Well apparently it wasn't sensational enough for them so they kept harassing my other coworkers for info. 
I keep in touch with only one of my coworkers (Charlie 28F) when out of office because we get along well and have similar interests. She told me that when coworkers from other teams would asked if I was sick or in vacation they would insinuate that I was supposedly sick and make it sound like it was a burnout ?? 
I was really WTF at that point. I didn't even see the big deal to begin with but since I had told them a reason I was confused even more..
My 2 weeks of sick days ended last friday, I am now in vacation for a month (thank god so I don't have to see them). I thought it would be the end of it but I was yet again WRONG. 
A former coworker which I had worked with 2y ago reached out to me in order to catch up. I was happy to hear from her so I replied instantly asking her how everything was. She told me my coworker (47F) (let's call her KAREN) had called her to ask if she had heard from me cause I wasn't showing up for work and I wasn't answering to anyone ??? Mind you during the 2 weeks I had periodically responded to texts in the group chat and answered their texts individually just one answer and not an answer to each of their sometimes 5 texts a day ! 
At that point I was really fed up so I muted them on whatsapp and blocked their numbers so I would stop receiving notifications of their calls and messages. 
I have heard from my coworker Charlie that they keep asking people if they have heard from me like I am a missing person when I am really just in (a preplanned) vacation.
I really cannot fathom why someone would act this way let alone two people ?! I feel like it's really creepy and it's starting to give me Martha from Little Reindeer vibes.

If anyone cares at all to respond you may ask why I haven't confronted them and told them to back off ? 
Well! They both come from a former job which resulted in a burnout after some really tensed work environment (which now I wonder if they were the main cause lol). They have a victim mentality and not an ounce of self awareness. I know from previous situations that they would only play victim, create an even more toxic environment and stop talking to me even on work related topics. 
I personnally wouldn't mind the peace and quiet but I have a really lovely coworker (55F Mary) who really cannot function when there is tension in the team, she has nightmares and doesn't sleep. She is the sweetest person and wants everyone to be friendly even if it means closing your eyes on some things (actually a lot).
I plan on leaving this department to work in another field but there are very few positions so it might be a while unfortunately. I don't want to quit because I have built seniority in this company and also the job market is shit at the moment lol.

Anyway, all of this to say am I valid in thinking this is insane behavior from anyone but especially coworkers whom I am not at all close with ?

HIV insanity.. each day drags on as we strangle ourselves in our silk noose, knocking cup after cup of coffee back, just to make it through and we wish we never knew.

We wish we never knew.. don’t say it, don’t think it.. its an active commitment.. and we’re dedicated to play the submissive role… apathy grows, spreads, emerges.. we find ourselves falling.. face first.. finding no reaction.

Finding no reaction from our divergence in path.. for few of us remember what we are to forget, disassemble, erase, from our minds.. we wander.. in and out of reality.. never knowing the limits or the beyond.. its all the same.

Its all the same.. we are all the same.. for it  and we are all molded, shaped, and conformed.. pressured and reduced to what we are.. powerless, faceless, emotionless..  despite all  convictions, by the same forces.

The same forces which we fear, we still blindly entrust.. following, chasing, ensuing.. only to find empty promises..  and yet we are still filled for hope… hope for the present.. hope for the future.. but mostly hope in what we believe is the past.

What we believe is the past.. is neither fiction nor fact, instead.. constantly blurring the lines as it exists from each moment, each decade, each century into the next, never entailing a lesson of which we desperately crave.

We desperately crave change… no longer knowing the means in which to perform, activate, or allowing it to happen..  and so we wait we wait.. impatiently, persistently, uselessly,  caught in the never ending cycle… wallowing in self pity.

I rejoined the gym about two months ago, but this time I’m genuinely committed. I started at 160kg and I’m down to 140kg now. I began with basic barbell work, almost no machines, and I’m currently benching around 50–60kg. I’ve also seen two dietitians, but neither gave me any real insight into my main issue.

Here’s the problem: I mentally aim for 2000–2400 calories a day, but my work schedule is super irregular. On my 12-hour shifts, I usually don’t eat at all — just one or two pocket coffees (my guilty pleasure). When I get home, I do my best to hit my daily protein target (150g), and I’ve been consistent with that. I’m getting stronger every week, which is great, but my total daily calories still average around 1500–1600, and I know that’s probably not sustainable or ideal long-term.

I’ve been cooking most of my meals, reading up on nutrition, and honestly trying really hard. I’ve cut out most junk carbs like bread and sugar. But lately, this low-calorie intake has been bugging me. I’m just not hungry — at all. I’m a decent cook, I try to stick to the limits my dietitian gave me, but it’s tough to eat more when there’s just no appetite.

Any advice on how to actually reach 2000–2400 calories without having to stuff myself or force it? I want to do this right.

I’m not feeling any negative side effects or signs of muscle loss — honestly, it’s the opposite. I feel stronger than ever. I just don’t want to mess things up early on by doing something unsustainable or unhealthy without realizing it.

A bit over a year ago my psychiatrist (I’ve been with him seven years now and have a great deal of trust in him) and we decided I should try some adhd meds and see if anything helped. We started with non-stimulants because it seemed like a good place to start. When that didn’t work, we moved on to stimulants, slowly building up the doses on each one I tried. I never felt anything aside from maybe a day of placebo when I started something and was really really hoping it would work.

What I take all the time (for drug interaction reference): 
sertraline and bupropion for anxiety and depression, liletta (levonorgestrel) IUD

What I’ve tried:
- Atomoxetine
- Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate
- D-amphetamine salt combo ER
- D-amphetamine salt combo IR
- Amphetamine-dextroamphetamine (I know it’s basically the same as the above but I switched pharmacies and they switched generics so I figure I should account for that)
- Methylphenidate HCL ER

On each of those meds I started at the smallest dose and worked up to a max dose at which point we could conclude it hadn’t worked. The only one that had any effect was the Lisdexamfetamine, which began to give me strong food aversion when I got to a high dose. I forget which one of them made me mildly anxious at a high dose. I never had any more energy, focus, ability to start/finish/switch between tasks, I didn’t get insomnia, nothing.

Also not a medication but caffeine has never worked for me. I used to think it was in that adhd way where it’s a stimulant so it has a mild stabilizing effect or makes you sleepy. I truly get nothing from it, unless I drink so much I get anxious, but short of that I don’t feel anything. Unless I skip my daily coffee drink and get a headache because apparently you can get withdrawal without experiencing any benefits.

After the last med we tried, the generic Ritalin, did nothing, my psychiatrist recommended we take a break and I look for someone else with deeper specialty in adhd treatment for a second opinion. I’m doing that, I have an appointment for a few months out, and I’ve started seeing an adhd/executive function coach to get better at working with my brain. It helps some. We also adjusted my anxiety meds up to help take some of the extra pressure off (I get very stressed out by how out of control and helpless I feel and that makes everything worse) so at least I don’t beat myself up as bad for the things I struggle with.

I guess I’m just looking for a little hope. Has anyone else found that they don’t respond to stimulants but found something that works? I feel like if I can just get something that works for long enough to get my feet under me I could muddle through but right now I’m barely treading water.

Trop d’infos, pas assez d’affinités, pas facile de savoir avec qui on va tomber.

Alors on a décidé de créer une app, pensée pour faciliter les rencontres amicales **autour d’activités qui nous ressemblent** (rando, café, jeux, sorties, etc.).

Alors OUI, on sait. Certains sont totalement anti App et on comprend tout à fait que ce mode de fonctionnement ne soit pas pour tout le monde. En revanche il y a du monde pour qui c’est plutôt pratique de passer d’abord par une application pour s’engager socialement.

Pas de dating, pas d’ambiguïté. Juste une façon simple de rencontrer du monde, seul·e, en couple ou entre amis.

L’idée vous parle ? On a mis en ligne une liste d’attente qui vous permettra d’obtenir 6 mois de fonctionnalités premium gratuites et puis surtout d’être nos bêta testeurs préférés ❤️

Il y la possibilité de répondre à un questionnaire pour mieux connaitre vos attentes aussi 😊

Hi all !

We noticed we’re not the only ones struggling to expand our circle of friends - whether it’s because we just moved to Montreal, we’re going through a new phase in life, or we’re simply tired of endlessly scrolling Facebook and Instagram trying to find something that actually makes sense.  
Too much noise, not enough real connection. And it’s hard to know who you’ll end up with.

So we decided to create an app designed to make it easier to build friendships through activities that feel like *us* (hikes, coffee meetups, game nights, outings, etc.).

And YES, we get it - some people are totally anti-app, and we totally respect that. But for many, starting with an app is actually a simple and convenient way to connect socially.

No dating, no ambiguity. Just an easy way to meet people - whether you’re solo, in a couple, or with friends.

Sounds like something you’d be into? We’ve launched a waitlist where you can get 6 months of free premium features and be one of our favorite beta testers ❤️

In summary (26F) 
-  November 2021: started experiencing mild constipation and on/off LRQ pain. The pain could be dull and achy, twisting or sharp and varied in exact location but was always LRQ. It sometimes hurt to lift my right leg.
- April 2022: Tested for ceoliac, IBD and abdominal ultrasound done. All clear and diagnosed with IBS. 
- November 2022: Symptoms persisted. Order ed private FIT test due to GP not taking me seriously, comes back as slightly positive (10.2 when threshold was 10.0). 
- December 2022: Slightly positive FIT sends me into spiral and GP agrees to order two FIT tests, both of which come back firmly negative. They order another ultrasound as routine.
- May 2023: Second abdominal ultrasound which found a couple of small cysts on my left ovary. 
- June 2023: Experience a stressful period at work followed by constipation and ~ 3 days of consistent bright red rectal bleeding. GP confirms it is a fissure. Hasn’t happened again since. 
- August 2023: Very mild COVID infection
- August 2023: Sudden almost lotal loss of libido accompanied with sexual dysfunction and lack of sexual sensation. Experience slight pain in place of what usual arousal would feel like, no improvement since then.
- November 2023: Still experiencing original constipation and on and off pain. Accompanied anxiety leading to over analysis of stool and noticing black grounds / red flakes (I do eat a lot of coffee, tomatoes etc but I was convinced it was CC)
- December 2023: Gastroenterology referral. GI is not concerned about CC and says a colonoscopy would be an unnecessary invasive procedure based on my symptoms. Orders a small bowel MRI with contrast instead which comes back clear other than backed up stool showing in colon on right side. GI doc confirms IBS. 
- April 2024: Start experiencing sacroiliac joint pain and shooting pains (not sciatica) associated with running and other movements. 
- August 2024: Second mild covid infection.
- September 2024: Severe brittle hair and breakage, particularly around the crown, no unusual hair loss from the root. 
- December 2024: Suspect thyroid issue, full  thyroid / hormone panel + bloodwork, neck ultrasound done and all are normal. 
- February 2025: Private GP suggests neurosurgeon referral due to back pain and potential neuro symptoms. Brain + spine MRI come back normal.
- Present: all systems other than rectal bleeding persisting. Currently very anxious and constipation has worsened and has been accompanied with a couple of instances of shooting rectal pain (similar to what I would get on my period) and decreased appetite.

Throughout this entire process the only diagnosis I’ve received is IBS and long covid (even though I am not experiencing long covid in the traditional sense) but I’m so sure there is something more is going on. I have developed severe health anxiety which I know may be causing some symptoms but I’ve always been a very anxious person and have never experienced anything like what I have over the past 3/4 years. Some people have suggested ehlers danlos - I have ADHD, am hypermobile and my wrists and ankles often randomly feel “broken” but I don’t think that explains everything. 

Basically if anyone could give me some pointers as to where to look next / what tests to push for to get some answers that would be much  appreicated. ",1,1751578136.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

I am a software engineer and have already built a custom application that can control the G70 via phone, computer etc. Just like the Genesis app this one can turn the car on and off, lock/unlock etc. However in my app I have activated voice controls, so you can ask things like “Hey Genesis, turn on my car.” or “Hey Genesis, what is the current state of the car?” or “Hey Genesis, tell me where the car is”, and in all cases you get both an audible and written response back as well as the desired action. I’m currently in the process of using machine learning and AI to track routine based things, like let’s say you get coffee every morning at 0745 Monday-Friday, well you might get a notification saying “Hey just a heads up, you’ve got just enough gas to go grab coffee from Starbucks like you usually do, but I advise you go fill up at THIS gas station immediately after.” and provide other insights based on vehicle data.

My question to you all is, what currently does the Genesis app NOT do that you really wish it did do? Or in general if you have any clever ideas for a car app, I’d love to hear the ideas here.

1lr1elw,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lr1elw/i_30f_dont_like_my_dads_56m_relationship_dynamic/,I (30F) don’t like my dad’s (56M) relationship dynamic with my step mom (55F) but I don’t know if there’s anything I can do about it?,"I don’t even know where to start - I don’t know if it’s my place to say anything. 

Both my Dad and my Step-Mom (SM) have experienced a lot of trauma in their lives. My dad struggles with mental illness, and has since I’ve been old enough to remember. I can’t remember the last time he held down a solid job, preferring to work on passion projects.
He’s also very ‘scared’ of lots of things. Pessimistic, sees the worst and the worries in almost every situation. I absolutely love him dearly, he would do anything for my brother and I, but there are a lot of ‘life’ things I worry about.

My SM was in an abusive relationship for many years, until he died in a fire. I don’t know much more than that, besides that they make very dark jokes about it so it must have been bad. She is the sweetest human I’ve ever met in my life. Think your favourite elementary school teacher. She is catholic, but not super devote anymore.

I live in another province/state, so I see them once every year or so, so I get a snippet into their lives of a few days. They were married 10 years ago. I talk to my dad often, and mostly talk to my step mom with special occasion texts, etc.

Both my dad and my step mom are very progressive I think, realizing that they’ve experienced trauma and are actively working to be better. However, there are a lot of things I dislike about their relationship, and then things I find blatantly concerning. I understand that it’s not my place to mention the things I don’t like, that’s my issue, but I don’t know what to do about the things I find concerning. 

Some things I dislike: 
- my SM financially supports the family. My dad might contribute a little, but SM carries the brunt of it so he can work on his passion projects. She probably earns a decent living, but they are not wealthy by any means.

- she cooks and cleans after every meal. There was a situation where my SM had gone to something in the AM so my dad and I were home. Dad said to me “I feel like bacon and eggs but not enough to cook it ugh”. And waiting until Leeanna got home so that she could make it. He doesn’t offer to help with prep, or clean up. 

- it feels like anything he says, goes. I feel like they’re constantly buying new furniture, new electronics, new everything because it’s all what my dad wants.


THIS I understand might be coloured by my own ideas of what relationships should be, I recognize that. 

What’s concerning: 

- when my dad is stressed, it feels like he emotionally takes it out on SM. Like, he was working on a project that was out of his comfort zone, and SM was helping him. When she didn’t immediately do what he asked, he would make an exasperated noises and purse his lips and roll his eyes. When she picked up the wrong thing, he spoke in a tone like she was stupid. When she moved too far ‘out of his reach’, he condescendingly said “I didn’t ask you to move to a different time zone”.  When she can’t read his mind about what he wants, he gets more and more frustrated at her trying to help, but then depends on her to be there. It’s really tough to watch - it felt like she was scrambling/desperate to help.

After I was very visibly uncomfortable with seeing him like that, I excused myself. He recognized his behaviour and apologized to both SM and I, and was marginally better for the rest of the project... until the next time he’s stressed.

- SM used to be a big hiker, and I’ve recently got into camping, so I was raiding her gear. I think he asked a question and I answered, and then SM chimed in. I think it may have been at the same time as he started to say something, or overlapping the tail end of what I was saying, and he cuts her off in a louder than normal voice, and goes “WOW you really HAVE had a lot of coffee today!” effectively ending what she was saying. I said “no she hasn’t, she’s just excited” in a ‘leave her alone’ kind of tone. She kind of pipes up, but her enthusiasm was effectively curbed.

- she fawns over him. If he expresses any kind of concern or inconvenience, it’s “oh can I do that for you” or “oh can I go get that for you”. “I’m hungry” “oh let me make you something”. “Oh my computer is dying” “oh let me grab your charger”. 
She is an incredibly sweet, helpful lady, but it really takes it next level with him.

None of these things are enough to raise RED red flags, but as someone who was semi-recently in a very unbalanced relationship, I feel like I’m recognizing a lot of patterns that I don’t want for my SM, OR that I don’t think my dad would be happy to see in himself. 
I’m kind of stuck between “this is their life - they’re (overall) happy. If she’s unhappy, she’ll say something” and “she’s exhibiting trauma responses, he’s being mean and no one is saying anything. I want to make sure he’s not steamrolling her”.
Do you think there’s any grounds for me to make sure that she’s okay? Do you think I could point out Dad’s behaviour without overstepping into their relationship?

I thought that my issue was insufficient protein or that I had to have carbohydrates with meals to not have symptoms. I knew I would get diarrhea eating certain things, unless I ate other things with it, and was decently successful at managing my problem. I battled violent diarrhea if I fasted, had to make sure that I drank no coffee of tea on an empty stomach and generally understood that I had a time limit between meals in order to prevent having urgent bathroom emergencies.

In any case, fast forward to 2 months ago, and everything I thought I knew has gone out the window. My old safe standbys do not alleviate symptoms anymore, and the only thing that can give me normal bowel movements is something that I discovered by accident years ago, and that's Taco Bell. I know people have digestive issues with it, it's a stereotype, but it gives me almost perfect bowel movements when I eat it. I don't have to avoid hot sauce, onions, or anything else, and I have no issues with it, but it's wearing on me. I can't seem to get my symptoms to subside with anything else, and that's what's frustrating. I'm worried about my overall nutrition eating it frequently, but it's keeping everything in like ot should.

I don't even know why I'm really here, I guess I'm just venting because I'm getting burned out on eating the same thing so often, but we don't get to choose what gives us relief.

For anyone wondering, my staples at Taco Bell are the beefy 5-layer burrito, cheesy double beef burritos, and cheesy gordita crunch, all of which seem to sit well with me smothered in a liberal amount of hot and fire sauce. ",1,1751577783.0,bileacidmalabsorption,0,1.0,False

(I believe I found the same hybrid on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1683942215/) under the made up name Phal. 'Pop of Purple'. Their 3rd listing pic has some faint mottling like mine orig had--my pic 5-- before my mottling became a bit prominent.)

⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅  
Deets if ur interested:  
This was a Bloom Haus (Gubler) NOID from an LA Ralphs from Xmas eve 2024. Coincidentally I happened to see the same hybrid at a local nursery 3 days later (pic 6). Haven't seen any like it before or since. The flowers are nothing super special to behold...magenta more than fuchsia, like slightly more rounded & nominally larger than [Phal. Sogo Yenlin 'Coffee'](https://www.google.com/search?q=phal+sogo+yenlin+coffee&udm=2) flowers, so maybe 2"" wide. But they are FRAGRANT & this hybrid is also a prolific bloomer (I'll explain in a sec).

The special part is the mottled leaves (pic 2). They are subtly mottled but def noticeable. The mottling has become more pronounced in the 6 months I've had it (this can often happen w/ mass-grown mottled-leaf complex hybrids IME if your lighting is good). Mottled phals are my weakness & I know a number of the popular mottled leaf hybrids have trade names or even registered names (i.e. Phal. Pinlong Cheris, Phal. Naples Night, or the NL Perfume Factory ones like P. Odorion, P. Scention, etc.)...but I'm not familiar w/ this one!

Pics 1-5 are my plant. Pic 6 is the one I saw at the nursery (with the same mottling). Pics 1 & 2 are today. Pics 3, 4 are older blooms. Pic 5 was when I got it 6 mos ago (it had 4 arms & 30 buds!). It had or caught spider mites so I had to prematurely chop the spike twice but damn if that sucker hasn't just kept spitting out new secondary spikes! This is the 3rd spike since I got it! The flowers keep getting 1/4"" bigger each round, too! (And mites are gone thk god)

# Thursday, July 3rd (July 4th Weekend Edition)

Follow us on IG & FB @ BtownBrief

# Weather & Weekend Update:

Happy 3rd of July! Hope you’re staying dry out there. Today’s weather has certainly been a mixed bag, starting with some morning fog before giving way to scattered showers and thunderstorms. There was concern for severe thunderstorms this afternoon, but we seem pretty unscathed! Plus, the weather report said this should all clear out between 6 and 8 p.m., just in time for the fireworks to go off as planned. Once the rain moves on, you’ll want a sweatshirt for the show, as temperatures will dip into the low 70s. Tomorrow, however, is looking like a picture perfect Fourth of July, with plenty of sunshine and comfortable highs in the upper 70s. The fantastic weather is set to stick around for the weekend, with temps climbing into the mid 80s on Saturday and pushing 90 on a very summery Sunday.

With the storms clearing out this evening, the city's official **Independence Day Celebration** at Waterfront Park is the main event. Kicking off at 5 p.m., it’s the classic July 4th experience, complete with live music from Jesse Ray Smith and Sambatucada, plus a whole fleet of food trucks. If you're heading to the waterfront and want a delicious, portable bite, **MexCafeVT** is having its official launch event starting at 6 p.m. at its new 12-22 North space, serving up Al Pastor skewers. For those looking for a different vibe, you can catch a free set from **CRWD CTRL** at Foam Brewers at 8 p.m. The celebratory spirit continues Friday, with **The Phil Abair Band** hosting a 4th of July Bash at The Old Post, and DJs **Mel B & Kwame** bringing a dance party to the Vermont Lake Monsters game at Centennial Field.

If big crowds aren't your thing, there are plenty of other ways to enjoy the holiday. For a more peaceful experience on Friday, a **Community ""Perfection Free"" Kirtan** gathering for mantra meditation will be held in the beautiful stone circle at Oakledge Park starting at 6 p.m. It’s a great chance to relax and enjoy the sunset. For art lovers, GreenDoor Studio is hosting its **First Friday ""pop pow bang"" art show** from 5 to 11 p.m., an event fueled by an eclectic mix of acoustic and electric performers alongside a host of resident and guest artists. It’s a perfect showcase of the city’s vibrant, creative energy.

The fun doesn't stop after the Fourth. On Saturday, you can head over to the Odd Fellows Hall for **Odd Fest!**, a delightfully offbeat outdoor music bash from 1 to 7 p.m. featuring a stacked lineup of local bands like Better Things and Star Farm Band, all to support the North End Food Pantry. Later that evening, the **Twilight Block Party** returns to City Hall Park with free music from Leddy Moss and Boston's Copilot. To round out the weekend on Sunday, you can join the **North Beach Dance Social** for some salsa and bachata on the sand or catch the classic, free **Burlington Concert Band** performance at Battery Park as the sun goes down.

Reminder: Church St’s Weekly Wednesday Passeggiata deals: [https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/c/wednesday-passeggiata](https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/c/wednesday-passeggiata)

July in Burlington typically sees highs around 81 °F and lows near 62 °F. Today’s 77/58 sits a few degrees under normal, but the weekend warms fast toward possible record territory; expect a gradual ramp-up from pleasant 70s to sizzling low 90s by Sunday.

[**Jobs in Vermont launches on the VCET platform**](https://vermontbiz.com/news/2025/july/02/jobs-vermont-launches-vcet-platform?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=thursday-july-3rd-july-4th-weekend-edition)

“The quality and volume of inbound talent we're seeing is remarkable, but the efficiency in making smart connections and referrals is overwhelming for all involved,” says Nicole Eaton, Venture Platform Director, per Vermont Business Magazine.

This is an interesting move to address a common frustration in Vermont's job market: connecting the right people to the right opportunities in a state where networks are key. By creating a free, curated, and local-focused job board, VCET is trying to cut through the noise of huge national platforms like LinkedIn. For local tech companies and professionals, this could become a much more efficient way to navigate the hiring landscape.

[**UVM secures $1.2M grant to address Vermont’s mental health workforce crisis**](https://vermontbiz.com/news/2025/july/08/uvm-secures-12m-grant-address-vermonts-mental-health-workforce-crisis?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=thursday-july-3rd-july-4th-weekend-edition)

""While our leaders continue to call for expanded services, a major barrier remains: We simply don’t have enough trained providers. This grant allows us to grow our impact by preparing the next generation of clinicians to serve the communities that need them most,"" per Vermont Business Magazine.

This federal grant is a significant step towards tackling a problem every Vermonter is aware of: the severe shortage of mental health professionals, especially outside of Chittenden County. By funding Ph.D. students and partnering with community health centers, UVM is directly addressing the workforce pipeline issue. It’s a practical application of the university’s land grant mission, aiming to produce tangible benefits for communities that have been struggling to provide adequate care.

[**Hundreds now unsupported by state hotel voucher program after Scott executive order ends**](https://www.mynbc5.com/article/hundreds-now-unsupported-by-vt-hotel-voucher-program-after-scott-executive-order-ends/65271454?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=thursday-july-3rd-july-4th-weekend-edition)

""The Vermont Agency of Human Services Secretary Jenny Samuelson said roughly 380 households who used the program are being exited,"" per MyNBC5.

The end of the expanded hotel voucher program is a major development with immediate consequences for hundreds of Vermonters. This reversion to pre-pandemic rules marks a significant policy shift away from the emergency measures that kept many housed. As individuals like David Shappy face the prospect of street homelessness, the focus now shifts to local shelters and case managers who are bracing for the impact of this statewide decision.

[**Burlington pulls plug on plan to offer overnight parking for homeless**](https://www.wcax.com/2025/07/03/burlington-pulls-plug-plan-offer-overnight-parking-homeless/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=thursday-july-3rd-july-4th-weekend-edition)

""On Thursday, the mayor’s office said that due to substantial community feedback and threatening comments made online, they pulled the plug on the program,"" per WCAX.

Holy smokes, that’s intense. The swift reversal on the Perkins Pier overnight parking program highlights the intense pressure and division surrounding solutions to homelessness in Burlington. While the city intended it as a temporary, controlled measure, the backlash was immediate and severe. This situation underscores the difficulty officials face in balancing compassionate responses with public and business concerns, leaving the city back at square one for this specific issue.

[**Popular Burlington music venue Nectar's makes surprise appearance in new season of FX's 'The Bear'**](https://www.mynbc5.com/article/burlington-nectars-fx-the-bear/65279706?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=thursday-july-3rd-july-4th-weekend-edition)

""Eagle-eyed viewers on Reddit spotted character Pete Katinsky wearing a T-shirt sporting the Nectar's logo in the second episode of Season 4 of the smash-hit FX series,"" per MyNBC5.

It's always fun to see a little piece of Burlington pop up in a big way. The Nectar's shirt cameo on a critically acclaimed show like 'The Bear' is a cool nod to the city's iconic music scene. It’s a small moment, but one that gives a bit of national cred to a local institution many of us know and love!

[**Food Shelf moves back to Burlington July 15**](https://www.mychamplainvalley.com/news/local-news/food-shelf-moves-back-to-burlington-july-15/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=thursday-july-3rd-july-4th-weekend-edition)

""Feeding Champlain Valley (formerly Feeding Chittenden) announced Tuesday that their food bank will be returning to Burlington permanently later this month after three and a half months in Winooski,"" per ABC22/FOX44.

This is welcome news for many in the Old North End and beyond who rely on these crucial services. The temporary move to Winooski, while necessary for renovations, added a layer of difficulty for those with limited transportation. Its return to the North Winooski Avenue space on July 15 marks a return to stable, centralized access for the community.

[**Gov. Scott signs sweeping education reform package**](https://www.wcax.com/2025/07/01/gov-scott-signs-sweeping-education-reform-package/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=thursday-july-3rd-july-4th-weekend-edition)

""The law paves the way for larger classes, newer -- and fewer -- schools, no local budget votes, and what officials say will be better opportunities for kids,"" per WCAX.

This is arguably one of the most significant overhauls to Vermont's education system in decades, aimed squarely at reining in costs by forcing school district consolidation. While supporters argue it will address inequities and inefficiencies, critics fear it will erode local control and harm small town identities. The real work starts now, as a committee will draft new district maps, setting the stage for major political debates and fundamental changes to how our schools operate.

[**Burlington beaches reopen after 1st blue-green algae blooms of summer**](https://www.wcax.com/2025/07/03/burlington-beaches-reopen-after-1st-blue-green-algae-blooms-summer/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=thursday-july-3rd-july-4th-weekend-edition)

""Officials from Burlington Parks and Rec say Oakledge and Texaco beaches were closed on Thursday morning due to category 3 levels of cyanobacteria... But by Thursday afternoon, the levels had dropped and the beaches reopened,"" per WCAX.

This serves as our annual summer reminder that a watchful eye on water quality is part of the deal for lakeside living. The quick closure and reopening show that parks officials are monitoring the situation closely. It's a good heads up for all beachgoers to pay attention to the flags and official announcements before taking a dip, especially with the hot and sunny weekend ahead.

[**Marriott’s first ever net-zero hotel in Winooski**](https://www.mychamplainvalley.com/top-stories/marriotts-first-ever-net-zero-hotel-in-winooski/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=thursday-july-3rd-july-4th-weekend-edition)

""That’s right, this will be Marriott’s first all-electric, non-fossil fuel, net zero hotel in the whole world,"" per ABC22/FOX44.

This is a pretty big deal for Winooski and for Vermont's reputation as a leader in green initiatives. Combining a hotel, housing, and parking, the Sugar House project is a major development for the Onion City's downtown. Landing Marriott's first ever net zero hotel is a major feather in the cap, using geothermal and solar to create a model for sustainable building that will draw a lot of attention.

[**Is Vermont’s aging workforce straining the employee-owned business model?**](https://www.wcax.com/2025/06/30/is-vermonts-aging-workforce-straining-employee-owned-business-model/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=thursday-july-3rd-july-4th-weekend-edition)

""According to court paperwork, a number of factors led to Gardener’s downfall, including a boom and bust business cycle from the pandemic and a number of longtime employees looking to cash out,"" per WCAX.

The Gardener's Supply bankruptcy is sending a cautionary ripple through Vermont's dozens of employee owned companies. The case reveals a potential vulnerability in the model when a wave of retirements coincides with economic volatility. It’s a crucial conversation about long term financial planning for a business structure that is often touted as a solution for Vermont's aging business owner population.

# 202+ Things to Do in Burlington (Summer Activities)

Today’s picks:

Five more to keep the summer days feeling full and easy. Start with a visit to the Intervale Community Farm stand if you’re into fresh local produce, then take a walk through the nearby trails while you’re there. Head over to The Archives for an afternoon that blends classic arcade games with great drinks, especially if you want to dodge the heat or rain. Make a stop at the Whales Tails sculpture just off I-89 for a quick roadside detour that feels oddly peaceful. For something more active, grab a friend and hit the sand volleyball courts and the big ole treehouse at Oakledge Park. And if you just want to wind down, take a slow walk along the boardwalk at Waterfront Park and find an empty swing to watch the sky change from day to night.

Full list’s always waiting here when you need a plan: [https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/c/202-activites](https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/c/202-activites)

# This Week’s Restaurant Review: Hen of the Wood

Nestled inside Hotel Vermont, Hen of the Wood offers a sophisticated, farm-to-table dining experience that has become a standard-bearer in Burlington’s culinary scene. The ambiance strikes a balance between rustic charm and urban elegance, with dark wood and an intimate setting that echoes its original Waterbury location. This commitment to Vermont extends to its menu, which changes daily to showcase the freshest seasonal ingredients from a dedicated network of local farmers, ranchers, and artisans, creating a true taste of the region.

The menu’s reliance on seasonal availability means there are always new dishes to explore, but certain signature items have become beloved mainstays. The hen-of-the-woods mushroom toast with a poached egg is a consistently praised favorite, as are the simple yet perfect Parker House rolls with cultured butter. While the quality of the ingredients shines through in every dish, from fresh oysters to local cheeses, this dedication to premium, locally-sourced food comes at a cost, positioning it firmly in the upscale dining category with entrees often ranging from $35 to $45.

While Hen of the Wood has earned numerous accolades, including James Beard nominations for its chef and recognition as a top spot for business dinners, the experience isn't without its potential downsides. The restaurant's popularity can lead to a bustling and sometimes noisy atmosphere, which might not suit those seeking a quiet, intimate meal during peak hours. Securing a reservation can also be a challenge, but for a special occasion or a taste of expertly crafted, quintessentially Vermont cuisine, the consensus is clear: Hen of the Wood delivers a memorable and worthwhile culinary adventure.

1lr18hl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brooklyn/comments/1lr18hl/open_invitation_for_a_weekly_walk_at_marine_park/,Open invitation for a weekly walk at Marine Park,"Hey neighbors,

I'm a ordinary guy, currently a stay-home father, lookin to get more familiar with folks in my neighborhood. I'm tryin get a solid 10-12 people to walk with once a week, preferably Sunday mornings at 10 at Marine Park in south Brooklyn. You might have seen me post before. It's an ongoing project.

It's super informal, just me providing company for a few laps, maybe join ya for a coffee right after. We can talk life, hobbies, politics and religion as long as there's no judgement. I've met a handful of cool people so far, and have had one regular walking buddy, maybe just found another. 

The house of reps just passed the big, beautiful bill. They took money out of our earned benefits and social safety nets and pumped money into ICE, and tax cuts for rich people that don't need social safety nets. So they still took our money, but they gave it to violent, masked, unlawful strangers, and they also took our social security and whatever money they squeezed from the treasury and federal jobs and programs they cut, and paid themselves. I was in the YT chat today for this vote, and there were people that really believed it was just a teams sports thing. The rooted for the bill just to root for it, no acknowledgment of the kind of pain it could cause that has been verified by many credible organizations who run the numbers on this thing. And besides that, the dwindling middle class to say might have something to say about the continued fib that trickle-down economics was ever going to work.

So tax payer dollars won't be fully funding the things that help elderly people, vets and the disabled maintain their dignity for example. But we will be expanding inhumane detainment centers across the nation to support unconstitutional deportation practices. I'm a fan of the constitution, there are good things in there for us and it creates a fair playing field for ordinary people. Yes that includes immigrants, but maintaining civil liberties is worth it, in my opinion. I'm agnostic, but I like what folks say about Christ. I'm agnostic because the same folks talking about Christ don't seem to pay attention to what that man said.

Alongside the America we know, the one we step outside into everyday with a sense of predictability and general comfort, is another more hostile America where might makes right and bullies roam freely putting anyone practicing free speech on the ground. Quite frankly, this sucks. And it happened, despite this country's history and all it's progress, in part because we've been siloed off by algorithms and influencers. We need to be around each other and be OK with our differences in real spaces.

As a family man, I'm busy and I don't get out much but I can afford an hour or two on Sundays. Everyday people, like me, can be my church. I'll be there to talk because I think we need more of it in the world. For regulars, I have a discord and I'm trying to put a substack on current events so I'm not doom scrolling for nothing.

If you're interested, I have a contact list I'll add you to and can include you on my weekly follow-ups. Again it's just for 10-12 people, and there's maybe 2-3 of us so far.

We're both farming at oir garden and doing looong trails thru countries (Morocco, Netherlands, now upcoming Cyprus…) so I'm used to bad conditions.

But still… Yesterday we arrived and he fell in love with it… I was really anxious and overall I feel anxious till now. I'm scared of getting food poisining or sum even tho there is not a „real"" reason (no meat or eggs here)

Idk how to handle it. The system, the people and everything is just not a right match I thing. Maybe things will be better after few days but till now I had not so small amount of panic attacks and other…

I'm autistic and suffering with kinda harsh OCD but my psychiatrist and psychologist said it should be ok and beneficial for me…

We planned to stay for 12-14 days but now I think the maximum I'm able to do is like 7-9.
It's not so much work (we can work how many hours we want - even 0) but maybe the lack of structure and the fact I can't plan my day beforehad. The lots of new people (it's shared house) and everyday I'm meeting someone new. The fact my BF can't even speak german and I have to translate everything (and my german sucks) to all other members that to our host is EXHAUSTING.

And one and only thing I hate is that our host are super eco-bio food-based. I'm semi-vegan myself (eat honey, old shoes are leather) but for example all we eat here is beetroot and other things they grow. Which would be okay. but idk… some pasta for those 4th beetroots would be nice.
I wanted to buy oat milk for coffee but those store-bought are „poisson"" so… bruh. 

I can work with that but as autistic folk food is a big deal for me and I refused to eat beetroot due to one trauma for like 10 years… lol. And I tastes ir again like 2 years ago… still eating it for EVERY FUCKING DISH is too much for me.

How we should work thru? Am I an overreacting snowflake? Will it get better?

My regular teacher suffered a migraine, so he had to take some time off. The next day, Ms. Castro came in my classroom clearly looking annoyed, and holding a Starbucks coffee in hand. She made a list of dumb rules nobody wanted to follow. Rules like ""No looking the other direction when I'm teaching"" and stuff like that. Then, we got started learning about subtracting fractions. While she was yapping, I just took some notes in one of my notebooks. After the math lesson, we got a worksheet on subtracting fractions. With the notes I took, I used them to do my math worksheet. Halfway done with problem 6, Ms. Castro looked at my desk like I was committing a war crime and said ""Put the cheating device away, right now"" So I said ""Teach, I am not cheating, I'm just trying to do my worksheet with the notes I took"" Then she said ""Don't make up excuses, either put the cheating phone away or go to the principals office"" So I had to explain again that I wasn't cheating. She took it seriously and ripped my notebook apart then said ""I won't tolerate that attitude! Go to the principally office NOW!"" So I went to the principals office and I explained the situation. The principal wasn't happy and said ""That behavior is not acceptable! I will call her to a meeting right now."" And the best part?

1lr17xo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wordcloud/comments/1lr17xo/the_best_iptv_service_that_gave_me_all_my/,The Best IPTV Service That Gave Me All My Favorite Channels After I Cut My Cable Cord (No Tech Degree Required!),"Alright, let’s be real. Cutting the cable cord? Sounded awesome. That $200+ bill every month felt like robbery, especially when half the channels were infomercials or stuff I never watched. Freedom! Savings! …Yeah, right.

My first try at replacing it was like trying to assemble IKEA furniture in the dark. I signed up for some IPTV service my buddy mentioned (name long forgotten, probably for the best). “Thousands of channels! Super cheap!” he said. Cool.

What I actually got:

* Buffering. So. Much. Buffering. Trying to watch the big game? Spinning circle of doom right during the final drive. My blood pressure hasn’t recovered.
* “Where’s ESPN?!” Half the channels listed were either dead, in a language I didn’t speak, or just… gone. Finding my local news felt like a scavenger hunt I always lost.
* Setup? Let’s just say I spent more time Googling “M3U playlist error” than actually watching TV. My kids laughed at me.

This wasn’t freedom. This was a part-time job troubleshooting my TV. I felt scammed and stupid. Over the next few months, I tried four more IPTV subscriptions. Each one promised the moon. Each one delivered… well, something less than that. One vanished overnight. Another had picture quality like a potato. Another worked *okay* for a week, then started freezing constantly. I was ready to crawl back to the cable company, tail between my legs, begging for mercy (and my old bill).

# What I Actually Wanted (It’s Not Rocket Science!)

Forget the tech jargon. I just wanted my TV back, but cheaper and simpler. My wishlist was embarrassingly basic:

1. My Channels: ESPN for the games. HBO for the shows. CNN for the news (and my sanity check). The local channels for weather emergencies. My wife’s weird cooking channel. That’s it!
2. No Freezing: Especially during the last two minutes of a close game. Or the climax of a movie. Is that too much to ask?!
3. Easy Peasy Setup: Plug and play. Download an app, type in a username/password, boom. TV. I don’t want to code or configure servers. I’m not “that guy.”
4. A Fair Price: Under 20 bucks a month. Cable was highway robbery; I didn’t want a different kind of robbery.
5. Help If I Need It: A real person I can actually *talk* to if something goes wonky. Not a chatbot loop from hell.

# How I Finally Stumbled Onto the Good Stuff (Pure Luck & Desperation)

Honestly? I was about to give up. Saw another ad for an IPTV provider — [IPTVGREAT](https://iptvgreat.live/). Almost scrolled past. “Yeah, right,” I thought. But they offered a 24-hour trial, no credit card needed. *That* got my attention. “Fine,” I muttered. “One last shot. What’s another hour of frustration?”

Downloaded their app. Hit ‘play’ on ESPN…

And it just… worked. Like, instantly. HD picture. No buffering. During a live game!

I was suspicious. Fluke, right? Switched to HBO. Worked. CNN? Worked. My wife’s cooking channel? Yep. Even found my local news station. I sat there clicking around, half expecting the wheels to fall off. They didn’t.

Here’s why [IPTVGREAT](https://iptvgreat.live/) became my TV savior:

* It Actually Works (Consistently!): Rain, shine, Sunday Night Football, doesn’t matter. It just plays. That spinning circle is now a distant, traumatic memory.
* All My Channels Are *Really* There: No ghosts, no fakes. Everything I actually watch is in one place, easy to find. It felt like getting my old cable guide back, but better.
* Stupidly Simple: Seriously, the hardest part was remembering my email for the signup. The app is clean. No weird settings. My 70-year-old mom could probably figure it out (don’t tell her I said that).
* Cheaper Than My Weekly Coffee Habit: $14 a month. I spend more on snacks. After cable, this feels like stealing (the good kind).
* Real People Helped Me (Once!): I had a weird glitch setting it up on my ancient Firestick. Used their chat. A real person answered in like 5 minutes, walked me through it calmly. Fixed. Amazing.

# Yeah, I Tried Others Too (For Science… Sorta)

Since I was on a roll, I figured I’d peek at a few other best IPTV contenders people mentioned, just to compare during my trial phase:

* For Movie Binge-Watchers: My buddy swears by [IPTVFOLLOW](https://iptvfollow.com/). Says they have *everything*, like obscure 80s horror flicks and new releases super fast. If movies are your main thing, maybe check them out. Their trial is decent too.
* For UFC/Boxing Fans: [IPTVUNLOCK](https://iptvunlock.com/) is apparently the king for pay-per-view fights. Never misses an event. A bit pricier, but if that’s your jam, it might be worth it.
* On a SUPER Tight Budget? [IPTVGEAR](https://iptvgear.site/) was okay for the basics at $15. Fewer fancy channels, but if you just want news and the major networks, it gets the job done.

But honestly? For the mix of everything I need — sports, news, shows, reliability, simplicity, and price — [IPTVGREAT](https://iptvgreat.live/) hit it out of the park for me.

# My Life Now? Actually Enjoying TV Again.

It’s been four months. I pay $14. I turn on my TV (or phone, or tablet), open the app, and watch. Sports. News. Movies with the wife. Cartoons with the grandkids (when they visit). No stress. No surprise bills. No calling some 1–800 number and being on hold forever.

Cutting the cord *finally* feels like freedom. And it only took me five disasters and a lucky break to find [IPTVGREAT](https://iptvgreat.live/).",1,1751577582.0,wordcloud,0,1.0,False

I'm also really into coffee and books, preferably anything fantasy, horror or sci-fi related, so if you're into that too hit me up!

I told my husband I just wanted a family who cared about and loved me. I just miss a set of parents I've never had. My brother and I barely speak. The fact my psychiatrist and I recently came across a revelation that my dad has never said he loves me. And of course the sheer number of times my mom has compared me to her own abusive horrendous narc mom because I have the same mental health diagnosis as her. The list just goes on. Most of all the fact idea how is find out if one of my parents died. On my dad's side presumably my grandparents bc I do still talk to them but on my mom's side? I honestly don't know what that would do to my brother and if he's be mentally well enough to reach out and tell me.

Our household’s official sport.
Not basketball,
not checkers—
this game’s played between two bank accounts
and one wild sense of optimism.

See, I’ve got a system.
Direct deposit splits like a well-behaved teenager:
a chunk to savings,
the rest to checking,
and we all stay in our lanes.

My wife?
She’s more of a freestyle spender.
Likes to bounce money back and forth
like it’s doing warmups
for the Financial Olympics.

She picks a number—
what we’ll spend today—
moves that into checking
and leaves the rest to “safely rest” in savings.
(“Safely rest” means “we’ll need it by dinner.”)

It’s cute, really.
She’s trying to budget
like life listens.

But by 3 p.m.,
I’m transferring from savings
to cover a surprise coffee,
a forgotten field trip,
and the gas tank
that always hits empty
when we’re already late.

I keep hoping that savings will sit,
build up,
grow old gracefully—
like a tree or a wise old owl.
Instead, it’s more like a boomerang.
I throw it in,
and it comes flying back out
before it can even settle in.

She says,
“If we just stick to the plan…”
And I nod,
because I love her,
but the plan
has the stability of a toddler with a popsicle.

I check our account like it’s a slot machine:
“Maybe this time there’s something left!”
Usually there’s not—
just the echo of good intentions
and the ghost of paychecks past.

But hey—
we’ve never been late on bills.
The lights are on.
The fridge hums.
We argue about money like pros,
but we laugh about it, too.

Money Bounce.
Not perfect.
Not pretty.
But somehow,
it still works—
one transfer at a time.",1,1751577040.0,Poems,0,1.0,False

The first days I was so tired but it was a holiday weekend therefore it was full of eating and drinking and socializing with people I was comfortable around. I was taking 1000mg of l tyrosine the moment I woke up followed but coffees. This really helped my mood and noticed I wasn’t so lethargic. I drank caffeine throughout the day and ate a ton compared to being on Vyvanse which I think is good for the body every now and then. I made sure to give my body and break the first 5 days and then got back to my reg routine: walking 10k steps and lifting every evening. Still taking 1000mg l tyrosine and then another 1000 afternoon and eating lots. On the first day you feel your mood and energy come back (for me around day 4-5) try to meal prep as much as you can so you don't get overwlehmed and have some meals ready for you when you are noticibly more tired in the evenings. This has helped me a lot this week. I feel really happy and energized and wanted to share that if you are taking breaks make sure to give yourself grace and hopefully plan on some days off at the beginning. Your mood and energy will come back and if not don’t be too hard on yourself. I used to be but our bodies and minds are resilient :) ,0,1751576918.0,VyvanseADHD,0,0.5,False

I own my own place, does not depend financially on my partner (when I say I don’t, it’s not at ALL). I work in one of the top companies in Mauritius and have a good job. I don’t have guy friends, I am not on social medias. Based on comments received in my life, I am grateful to god that I can say I am beautiful. I go the gym. I don’t go out to party.. I only go out occasionally to have coffee with my friends (girls only). Loyalty is super important for me, so even under stress I’m not the type to do some kind of revenge cheating or go flirt with other guys neither a revengeful type of person. 

My flaws are : I smoke (cigs) & hot temper. 

For the smoking part it’s something I’m working on - I don’t want to spend the rest of my life smoking. 

For the hot temper: it’s not to the extent where I have a short fuse or I’m fussy. It’s really when you would be pushing my buttons, the worse it can get is me shouting and telling you you’re an as***le… I’m not agressive I don’t throw things or whatever. I don’t think I’m possessive either. But I’m surely working on anger management as well 

I would say, considering all the above and my requirements for a partner that I am easy going. Not looking for the cliché finance guy six figures whatever, I don’t care about this. I’m not looking for someone who’ll help me financially or who would bring me out in restaurants or hotels. I am not too difficult in terms of physical appearance as well.

My question is : why in the world is it nearly impossible for me to find someone who’s genuine, who’s not emotionally unavailable, manipulative or looking to go out with me just for sex. 

Happy to answer questions if needed. I might surely be wrong and there must be a reason for the constant disappointments that I experience in relationships.

At ang mga mosmos na walang alam akala nila cool yon. Sasabihin nilang bar when they wanted to say is club. Ang malala pa don akala nila pumupunta ang mga tao don just to hook up. When in reality, it's not like that. Yes, things do happen in those places, but it still depends on what type of club or bar you are going to. Maybe people would comment ""sa ibang bansa yon"", "" dyan lang yon kung nasan ka"". No! Its almost the same system but tayong mga pinoy hindi natin inaagahan ang alak pag walang okasyon and that's the only difference. 

What most people know are the ones with pr*ostitution. Then they even have the audacity to say that people who go there especially women are “pakangkang.” makakarindi lang at nakakapikang pakinggan. I would bet my dear life that those people have never even been to one in their entire lives. 

Here, bars are like coffee shops, well technically they are coffee shops in the morning. People here drink beer like it's a juice, in broad a day light. To those people who have no idea about the difference between the two

Bar = is like a café but with alcohol. Yes, some bars serve nonalcoholic drinks like coffee, juices, and even mocktails. If you want to relax or have a formal conversation with people or your workmates, you go here.

Club = is a place for people who want to dance or party. Not all clubs have strippers or anything like that.

Most of the time, these places have their own themes, restrictions, and dress codes. That’s why you’ll wonder why so many of them are popping up in the p hilippines because it’s the same in other countries.

I just want to break the stigma that still sounds so intense sa pinas na pinapalaganap ng mga pa cool kids or wala naman talagang alam. That just because someone goes to these places, they’re already loose. Come on, guys, it’s not the era anymore where all we have is an encyclopedia.

I have a standard size tuxedo cat that comes to the office with me about 95% of the time. The arrangement started when I got him at 7 weeks old and wasn't comfortable leaving him home all day, and now there would be office anarchy if I took him away. When he was little bitty I had a soft sided carrier with interior tethers and a seat belt loop, and I was perfectly pleased with it having up to that point only ever used it to get our other cat to and from the vet 2 minutes down the road. As 2 pounds turned into 3, then 4, then 5, and kept increasing, I started to find juggling the carrier and my work bag and my coffee from my parking spot to the office (a block and half) tedious. 

  
At that point I decided a pet stroller would be the most efficient way to get all my crap from the car to the office and back each day. So I did some research, and found what seemed like an economical system. It had a removeable carrier so that I could use the carrier in both the car and the stroller, which was my primary requirement at that point. Unfortunately, 6 months later I'm realizing I overlooked a lot of other considerations, so I'm looking to upgrade. The Tavo Maeve + Roscoe checks all the boxes, but if there's another option that'll get me under $750 USD, I'm all ears!

  
Specifically, I'm looking for:

(1) A sturdy stroller frame with good absorption and sturdy wheels - I am navigating cobblestones and very broken sidewalks daily, I need a stroller up to the challenge.

(2) A removeable carrier.

(3) Safety features: lock/brake on the stroller, internal tether(s) on the carrier, mechanism to strap the carrier into the car. With the cat commuting nearly daily with me at this point, car safety is one of if not my most important concerns. A big draw for the Tavo is the vehicle base and robust car safety.

(4) Top open/top load - The kitten uses the carrier as a bed when he is in the office, I need a carrier that will continue to offer this function.

(5) Ideally storage (a large underbasket for my work bag(s)) and a cup holder for the morning cup of coffee I'm toting with me.

I was out at a food truck market with my cousin, and at some point during all the chaos, I realized my iPhone was gone. I don’t know if it got snatched or if I just dropped it and someone took it, but either way, it was gone. I freaked out immediately, not just because of the phone, but because I’ve been using Apple Pay for literally everything, coffee shops, grocery runs, random takeout.

The first thing I did was use my cousin’s phone to log into Find My iPhone and mark my phone as lost. I also called my bank just in case, but the rep told me that Apple Pay stops working when the phone is marked as lost or erased remotely. That made me feel a bit better, but I still couldn’t help but worry. What if someone had already used it before I got to lock it? I keep my phone locked with Face ID, so I’m assuming that helps, but you never really know how fast these things happen.

Anyway, I ended up getting a new phone the next day and restored from backup, and so far I don’t see any weird charges. But it did get me thinking, how safe is Apple Pay really in situations like this? I always thought it was super secure, but now I’m curious if there are things I should be doing differently.

I tried this method a few times myself and it gave me good results! Not just symptoms that my body was falling asleep, but feeling closer to my DR, feeling detached from my CR, and as I'm autistic/ADHD, it's something that I struggle to do because I'm hyper-aware of everything whenever I attempt. Also since their method feels very easy and natural, I thought I could share what they told me with this reddit, hoping this is gonna help others to figure out which method works for them (I'm aware methods aren't always needed, but I know a lot of folks likes to use them as tools, so it's mostly adressing to them). Sorry if my english isn't perfect, I'm not a native english speaker.

*/!\\ THIS IS MOSTLY A SLEEPING METHOD, IT CAN PROBABLY BE USED AS AN AWAKE METHOD, BUT DEFINITELY WHEN IN A DEEP MEDITATIVE STATE OF MIND.*

**EARLY PREPARATION (OPTIONAL, BUT STILL EFFICIENT)**

* Look at stuff related to the DR you want to go to through the day. It can be pictures, watching youtube videos, movies, listening to music, anything that can help you having clear thoughts of it in your head.
* Put yourself into the mindset of shifting BEFORE laying down in your bed, like, one or two hours before, but like, don't just say ""I will shift tonight/today"" (depending if you plan to go shift during your sleep, or during a nap), say things like ""I'm gonna go see my significant other"", ""I'm gonna go see my friends"", just as if you could go there by taking the car, the bus or the train, the same way you'd say ""man I'm craving a cup of coffee"" then think about getting up and go into the kitchen looking for a cup of coffee.

**WHEN IN BED**

* Don't start shifting right away (key part). You gotta relax first, watch videos related to your DR, go relax the way you usually do right before you go to sleep. Empty your mind, take the time to let your anxieties of your day get off your thoughts. You can either lying in a position with your limbs not touching or in a comfortable position, it's up to you!
* When you start feeling really drowsy, that's your cue that you can start shifting. If you're not sure when  to start, if you struggle staying awake, or that your eyes start closing in it's own, then that's the moment to start!

**THE METHOD**

* Now that you're all drowsy and laying down, while you're drifting off to sleep, imagine how it would feel to be in your DR. Don't think about shifting at all, just feel yourself in your DR, and imagine how it would feels to be in your DR body. Where are you right now? (In your DR bed? Outside? In a specific place?) What are you hearing there? (Chirping birds? Cars? People talking? Walking? Is it raining? Is it windy?) Do you smell anything? (Outside smell? Nature smell? Food? Drinks?). Anything that is stimulating your five senses. Don't force anything, think of what it would FEEL like (l'm again using coffee as an example, but if I tell you ""think of how coffee would smell right now"" you can probably faintly smell it in your nose, or remember the smell itself) *You can visualize the place directly and what you could see in front of you, but if you got aphantasia, you can focus on anything else that doesn't require visualization.*
* Keep focusing on your senses until you're drifting off to sleep while keeping your mind awake. If you're unsure how to know if you're fully asleep or not, you can check it by trying to open your eyes. If you can't open them as if your eyelids are too heavy to even lift them: congratulations, you're asleep! Keep going!
* Symptoms include the feeling of sinking into your matrass or feeling like floating and feeling really heavy at the same time. But don't overthink them, like don't go all like ""omg it's working"". If your mind gets too excited, it might pull you off that state as it's your CR body just falling asleep (and if you get too much aware of your CR body, welp, it keeps you grounded there). Focus on how your DR BODY would feel, not your CR body.
* Once you reach that sleep state, keep focusing on your DR self and your DR environment around you until the shift finally happens! Don't stress things, let it come naturally, don't go like ""okay, final push, I need to keep going, I'm so close!"". You already exist there, you don't need to think about shifting, just keep grounding yourself into the DR you want to go to.

**EXTRAS**

* If you hear noises from your CR, trick your mind into thinking they're part of your DR, EVEN if those sounds are not supposed to exist in your DR! If you hear a car, it might be a passing car really close to  your home or next to you. A snoring person? Either someone from your DR is sleeping near you or you're snoring yourself. A loud person talking? Might also be someone nearby or something you hear on a TV on, etc... Adapt it so it kinda fits your DR and trick your mind it's here!
* Racing thoughts? Acknowledge it but don't start panicking and be like ""Oh no! I can't think about that right now, I'm trying to shift!"". If you get distracted by those, either trick your mind it's your DR self thinking about that (even if it's not part of your DR, like lyrics of a song you recently heard), even if you're shifting to a DR that got a different language, or you can just gently redirect your thoughts to focus on your senses and FEEL yourself in your DR.
* No affirmations needed with this method (unless that's something you know helps you). My friend told me they never use affirmations because affirmations keeps them grounded to their CR instead.  They truly put ALL their focus into feeling their DR AND their DR self and acknowledge they're already there and don't need them.
* The key is to fully focus about how it feels to be in your DR and how it feels to be your DR self. Example: if you shift as a robot, feel your joints, feel the wires and feel the robotic parts of your body.
* Don't overthink about if you made it or not. You don't have to think about when you will know if you're in your DR already: you will KNOW when you're there, because you'll feel it the same you're right here, reading this post, not questioning if you're truly in front of your screen reading it.

**ADDING MY OWN ADVICE TO THIS POST:** IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE AND THAT YOU FEEL SO DESPERATE TO SHIFT THAT IT MAKES YOU FEEL REALLY STRONG NEGATIVE EMOTIONS LIKE ANGER, SADNESS, OR THAT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU SHOULD GIVE UP, PLEASE TAKE A BREAK LONGER THAN JUST A FEW DAYS. IT HELPS RECHARGING YOUR MOTIVATION, TRUST ME. YOU WILL GET THERE. SHIFTING REQUIRES A LITTLE BIT OF PRACTISE BUT YOU WILL GET THERE. IT TOOK FIVE YEARS FOR MY FRIEND TO SHIFT, AND THEY MADE IT AND NOW TELLS ME ABOUT THEIR SHIFTING STORIES REGULARLY. I KNOW I'M JUST A RANDOM FOLK FROM THE INTERNET, BUT IF MY FRIEND MADE IT, THEN WITH DETERMINATION AND BELIEF IN OURSELVES, WE CAN ALL DO IT!

Anyway, I work from 5-2 most days at a fun job that doesn't make me wish my eyes would be plucked out so I'd have an excuse to never be there again. No siree.

My break times are weird, basically. I eat breakfast at 9, and I'm just awkwardly hungry if I don't have a snack until dinner time at 4. Works been a bit crazy because of the 4th, so I was absolutely starving Monday when I got back. I usually hang my keys on a hook by the door, but I bee-lined to the couch to have a snack first. I set my keys down on the coffee table, assuming they would be safe.

I assumed wrong.

Tuesday morning- 4:30, I go to leave. I'm drowsy, so I check the hook first. Not there! My pockets? Not there! Washer, trash, outside, my aunt is awake and helping, she can't find them either. It's getting way too close to 5, thankfully I like to get there a bit earlier, so I'd had time to look. My aunt gave me a ride (we work at the same place, just different departments and she works a couple hours later) and on my lunch I took her car back home to look- but first, I go to let the dog out.

Laying in the sun, enjoying the comfy carpet in one of her favorite spots? That's right: PRINCESS! WITH MY KEYS!!!

Of course I snapped a photo of the evidence, sending it to my aunt. She immediately blames her other cat. His names Winston, and he's just misunderstood. Codename: Fuckface. He's the precious fluffy second cat pictured.

She says he stole them and brought them over to Princess, but that sweet boy would never! Even if he does have a bit of a history with chaos and mischief, he's an angel.

1lr0ktp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1lr0ktp/does_elite_gourmet_ehc4128_coffee_maker_deliver/,Does Elite Gourmet EHC4128 Coffee Maker Deliver Quality Brews? Detailed Review,"Testing out the Elite Gourmet EHC4128 Automatic 4-Cup Brew & Drip Coffee Maker was like having a mini café in my own home. As someone who juggles work and managing a household, I was eager to see if this compact coffee maker could keep up with my caffeine-driven mornings and occasional lazy afternoons. With its sleek design and practical features, it’s clear that this little machine is geared toward simplicity and convenience. However, there are a few quirks worth discussing.

**Compact Size and Practical Design**  
The first thing that struck me about this coffee maker is just how compact it is. Measuring only 8” x 9” x 6”, it's perfect for small kitchens, dorm rooms, or even RVs. It takes up minimal counter space, which is always a win for those of us trying to cram multiple appliances into tiny spaces. Despite its size, the modern black finish gives it a polished, upscale look that fits well with any kitchen décor. The 4-cup capacity might seem limited, but it actually worked out perfectly for me when brewing for one or two people.

**User-Friendly Brewing Experience**  
Operating this coffee maker is ridiculously easy. The straightforward on/off switch and semi-transparent water reservoir make it foolproof, even if you’re fumbling for coffee in your pre-caffeinated haze. The water level indicator is a nice touch, ensuring I never accidentally overfill the machine. The reusable filter is an eco-friendly bonus. Not only did it save me the hassle of buying paper filters, but it also proved super easy to clean. Just rinse it, and it’s ready to go again!

[Check Elite Gourmet EHC4128 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0czqctd4k/)

**Performance and Features That Stand Out**  
Beyond the basics, the performance of this coffee maker genuinely impressed me. The Pause N Serve feature might be small, but for someone often running late, it’s a lifesaver. I could pour a cup mid-brew without spilling all over the counter or ending up with half-brewed coffee. What also surprised me is the Keep Warm function, which kicks in automatically after brewing. No more lukewarm coffee when you go for your second cup! 

The glass carafe feels sturdy but lightweight, and with its 4-cup capacity, it’s ideal for solo coffee drinkers or small gatherings. Just a heads-up: the coffee does brew quickly, so leaving it in to ""keep warm"" too long can lead to a slightly bitter taste—you’ll want to drink it fairly soon.

**Highlights**  
- Compact and space-saving design, perfect for small spaces.  
- Reusable filter saves money and is environmentally friendly.  
- Pause ‘N Serve feature for impatient coffee lovers.  

**Hurdles**  
- The 4-cup capacity might not be enough for larger households.  
- Glass carafe can feel fragile compared to alternatives like stainless steel.  
- The Keep Warm feature might overheat the coffee if left for too long.  

**Fits Perfectly in a Specific Lifestyle**  
While testing the machine, it became clear that this isn’t aimed at large families or hardcore coffee enthusiasts needing intricate settings or large capacities. Instead, it’s a brilliant option for students, travelers, or anyone who drinks only one or two cups a day. My co-worker, who grabbed one for her studio apartment, even mentioned how convenient it was for brewing just the right amount without waste. Small households or individuals will find its size and simplicity a perfect match.

**Competing Products and How They Compare**  
When pitted against other compact drip coffee machines like the Black+Decker 5-Cup and the Mr. Coffee Mini Brew, the Elite Gourmet coffee maker shines with its reusable filter and Keep Warm feature. Both competing models require disposable filters, and while they share similar size and brewing capabilities, they fall short in eco-friendliness. However, the Mr. Coffee Mini Brew edges out slightly in brew speed, taking about a minute less. That said, the cost difference makes the Elite Gourmet coffee maker an attractive choice.

**Smart Spending**  
In terms of value, this coffee maker offers a tremendous price-to-features ratio. For its compact size and automatic features, it holds up well against pricier alternatives. The programmable settings and reusable filter only sweeten the deal. While it might not be a luxury appliance, it certainly over-delivers for what you’d expect. Budget-conscious buyers will appreciate its practicality and reliable performance.

Also, spoilers for the end of season 2.

I'm not super well versed in the coffee theory so let me know if I'm wrong about this. From what I know, the theory boils down to, it's the Metatron's fault that Aziraphale left to Heaven because of something he did to the coffee. 

I, personally, find this to be ridiculous. Aziraphale's actions are not out of character for him. We have seen him, on multiple occasions, putting himself and his desires above others'. He brain washed people to think that they were in a Jane Austin book for whomever's sake.

Aziraphale is an inherently flawed character. I love inherently flawed characters. They bring more to the table then those who aren't. Aziraphale is kind of an asshole sometimes and that's what makes him so great. Sometimes we need more out of a character than just hehe silly.

Thats all my coherent thoughts on this subject for the time being. Thank you for reading and have a nice day.",2,1751575927.0,goodomens,0,1.0,False

I received a message in the app about 4 hours ago saying they were going to come by but I didn’t see that until after the fact. When we walked into the house after grabbing a coffee in town, there was a little box inside the house by the front door. I’ve never had someone walk into my rental property without consent before and my dog was right there (in a cage) and probably freaked out too. Walking in and seeing the gift scared the shit out of me. Feels like a violation. Is this technically “ok” on their end or are there rules against it?

UPDATE: Here is VRBO’s policy. Entering my rental
Is a violation of the contract I signed. Hate me all you want, it is still a violation….legally. “Guests have every right to enjoy their rental space with a sense of security and privacy. Hosts should not enter the property unless it’s in response to an active emergency, or the guest has provided prior consent to the host. Emergency reasons may include scenarios where first responders are deployed, such as fires or suspected criminal activity.
An emergency is not based on a host's subjective sense of what is urgent. To obtain the guest's advance consent, hosts must provide guests with the purpose, time, and length of entry. Hosts must make reasonable efforts to limit time spent at the property.” 

PS: I am not leaving them a bad review. The house is great otherwise. This is my first VRBO rental and the experience was momentarily off-putting. I informed them of my discomfort and they sincerely apologized. ",0,1751575907.0,vrbo,44,0.4,False

Hi everyone, 

not a native speaker, living in Germany.
I started quitting caffein today, tried to quit it many many times before. 
I am so happy that I have found this group / reddit. The articles are so interesting an I can relate to so many postings here.
I brought two questions / observations that I would like to ask you about. Really curious and looking forward to your answers and opinions:

1. Mind games: I am really mentally driven. When I am about to quit caffein and the first symptions of withdrawals are hitting, my mind starts to play its game and talks talks talks (monkey mind). the story my mind is telling is always like, ""just now, just one more coffee, just today etc.? ... ..."" but what is really bothering me is that I have the idea / deep belief that I have built up karma since I first started with caffein and everything I built up on caffein can only be revised with caffein. E.g. I made a wrong decision under the influence of caffein that I can only revise with caffein. E.g. I chose the wrong job, appartement etc. and without caffein I do not have the power to revise those wrong decisions. Anyone experience with this kind of ""belief system""? 
2. Body: Has anyone experience with nail fungus? I read somewhere online that caffein withdrawal can cure longterm nail fungus? Would be insane. 

Hope I can manage withdrawal with help of this group. 

Thank you in advance.

My father has Parkinson for 5 years now. 21 June, we went to the hospital because he started to have hallucinations constantly for the time throughout the day.

He sees people, for example my sisters, but also unknown people from every type, animals.   
  
In the ER, he had a very small bleeding in the brain, but nothing that would cause this hallucinations according to the doctors of the hospital.

They just sent him back home, and nothing since yesterday, where it went full speed. He couldn't sleep the whole night because ""people"" were messing with him, he saw water on the ground, he tried for the first time to interact with his hallucinations, with a ""bag"" that he forgot in the bathroom.

And the biggest thing that struck me: HE FORGOT WHERE WAS THE TOILET. He lived his whole life in this house.

So I decided to bring him to the ER once again, and he wasn't even able to walk. Doctors told me he was dehydrated.

Came back today, still hallucinations, where he sees people, he even saw me making coffee for ""people"" in the living room, when I was working in my room.

I think there not really any solution other than medicine. The fact that I brought him to the ER two twice was me copping I think, that I didn't want to think that it was the Parkinson ""growing"" and making his life more difficult.

It's been the first time that one of his condition (and he got a lot of other stuff, like 2 TIA, a lot of heart problem)  affected me to the point that I cried a little bit honestly. I know that he is old (born in 1946), and those things are inevitable.

I'm waiting for the neurologist & cardiologist to see how we will adapt his medicine. He is on modopar 62.5, 125mg, NeuroPro patch, and some other stuff for his heart.

I know the hospital neurologist says that he should slow down the Modopar 62.5, and eventually stop it totally, but it's at his designated Neurologist to make the final decision.

Meanwhile we get an appointment, does anyone have some tips on how to relieve him from this ?

I try to not tell him that's it's not real or in his head, and I let him explain me what he sees. If for example he is uncomfortable with the people he sees, I will tell him to go to another room, and we wait 5min until they go away.

Not sure if that's the right approach to things, let me know.",3,1751575787.0,Parkinsons,1,1.0,False

One pattern keeps showing up: most people push through mental fatigue without realizing it’s part of a natural biological cycle, not a flaw.

The brain follows predictable cycles of alertness and recovery (called ultradian rhythms), typically every 90–120 minutes. When we ignore those dips and power through with coffee, stimulants, etc. we overload the brain’s recovery systems. 

Over time, that can reduce cognitive flexibility.

I’ve been working on ways to help people tune into these cycles more precisely (e.g., like tracking sleep, HRV) and found that you can forecast when your brain is primed for deep focus and when it’s better to rest with just a couple minutes of cognitive testing per day.

I’ve been experimenting with ways to track these rhythms more precisely including a tool I’ve been developing that uses games to forecast peaks and dips. It's been eye-opening to see how much sharper I feel just by syncing my day to my brain’s actual rhythm. 

Curious if anyone else here is measuring or tracking anything similar? Any tool recs out there?

I was shocked to find that when I had deleted all the apps from my phone, and logged out of all my browser sessions, that I began to experience textbook withdrawal. Symptoms like anxiety, irritability, insomnia, cravings, and brain fog.

After a few months the symptoms had subsided enough, so I decided to go ahead and quit coffee too. And wow, wouldn't you know it, that decision landed me right back in withdrawal country. 

Now, don't get me wrong. These were positive decisions which I stand by. It's just amazing to me how my life as a modern American has left me booby trapped with triggers that can send me plunging right back into withdrawal at any time.

I'm sitting here in withdrawal as I write this. Because last week I caught on to this compulsive snacking issue that I had. I think it was some kind of maladaptive coping strategy that I picked up when I was young.

Leading up to last week I would have thought that I was living a healthy and relatively strict, productive lifestyle. That nasty snacking habit was hiding in plain sight.

# Orange X Santal

**Notes -** 

Bitter Orange, Australian Sandalwood, Cypress, Basil, Oakmoss

This opening has one of the most realistic orange notes I've smelled - juicy, pithy, and bitter - the skin, pith and juice of one of those big oranges they use at fresh juice stands.

However, as this dries down I get a note that is very very masculine to me - possibly the cypress which I'm not too familiar with - there's something in the sillage that reminds me of men's deodorant spray. Definitely leans masculine to me, but that fresh juicy orange opening could be addictive!

The masculine edge stays in the drydown as the orange note fades fast - dominated by oakmoss rather than sandalwood to my nose. This note is listed as Australian sandalwood which apparently is dry rather than creamy. It is a fresh, slightly aromatic drydown with plenty of sillage but I can't get the Lynx deodorant vibe out of my head.

The drydown of this lasts and lasts and lasts - I still smelled oakmoss on my skin as I was getting ready for bed - 14 hours after I first sprayed.

I also popped out on my lunch this day for a personal appointment & wanted to refresh my perfume so I splashed on some of my tiny bottle of Bal D'Afrique. This is technically 'cheating' on the rules I set myself for an all-day wear, but let me tell you - after two hours, Bal D'Afrique had vanished and Orange X Santal continued- so impressive.

Boyfriend wore this the next day and I could smell it on him at the end of the day! Not one for me but I loved smelling it on him.

**6/10**



# Nice Bergamote

**Notes -** 

Bergamot, Jasmine, Ylang-Ylang, Cedar, Tonka Bean

The opening is - a nice bergamot! So fresh and perfect for the hot weather.

As this is a bergamot scent, the fresh citrus doesn't last too long (and I wasn't expecting it to) but this settles down into a lovely, very wearable, clean scent. It's familiar too, reminds me weirdly a lot of the JHAG DNA and - sounds crazy as it doesn't share a single note - the drydown of [Pear Inc](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Pear-Inc-66120.html).

I don't smell jasmine, I smell musk and ambroxan! Did this perfume break my nose!? I cannot believe this doesn't have a musk note!

This is a great clean hot weather scent, but at first I thought there was little to write home about. To be fair, it fulfils the brief - this is a lovely take on the bergamot note. Sillage is faint and unobtrusive. Lasts around 3 hours. 

I ended up wearing this again at night and the next day - I ended up reading quite a few reviews and noone had the same experience as me, so maybe don't take my word on this one.

This perfume really stuck with me and made me feel so intrigued- why is it so different on my skin to everyone else? Just one of the many reasons why I'm obsessed with the art of perfume!

I'm glad this set had 2ml samples because the more I wore this, the more I loved it. My citrus freshie of choice this summer is a bottle of [Vetiver Pamplemousse](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Zara/Vetiver-Pamplemousse-58155.html) and now I wish I had this instead!

I really fell in love with this perfume, which was so unexpected!

**9/10**



# Divine Vanille

**Notes -** 

**Top -** Cinnamon, Black Pepper, Clary Sage

**Middle -** Incense, Osmanthus, Pomarose

**Base -** Madagascar Vanilla, Tonka Bean, Siam Benzoin, Texas Cedar, Patchouli, Musk

A warm, cosy, familiar vanilla- I like the cinnamon note here - a real love/hate for me and I feel it can really overtake a fragrance, but it's well-blended with the vanilla, tonka and benzoin. This leans away from sweet and far more towards an ambery take on vanilla- very unisex, a touch aromatic too. Reminds me of some recent Middle Eastern perfume profiles like [Teriaq](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Teriaq-89850.html).

This dries down quickly into a powdery, warm, spicy vanilla scent - I am really picking up the benzoin in the sillage, which is weak but pleasant- feels like a good everyday perfume for autumn.

This lasts about five hours on my skin - I have nothing bad to say about this scent but it lacked a 'wow' factor. Vanilla is so popular and I've tried so many takes on it but would definitely recommend to someone seeking a unisex take on vanilla that doesn't project too much.

**7/10**



# The Musc

**Notes -** 

Musk, Beeswax, Lavender, Sandalwood, Ginger

Opening gave me an instant hit of baby wipes/baby powder - I can really pick up the beeswax which gives a hint of sweetness and lavender which gives an aromatic hint. The newborn baby vibe is really interesting, but also very much not my vibe. 

A few minutes in and the beeswax note starts to bother me a little, feel like it sours a little in the drydown - maybe even a little nauseating?

After 40 minutes, I really did start to feel sick. I ended up scrubbing.

This is definitely reminiscent of newborn skin - an amazing effect, but not one I want on myself at all - am I a monster???? Maybe!

I was very shocked by my reaction to this as I love love love musks and this fragrance was one of the main reasons I got the set. I think the realism of the baby wipes/newborn smell has too much of a mental connection to filled nappies to me. If I'm smelling that smell, liquid shit can't be too far behind - I've never had such an intense psychological association to a smell like that before.

The first perfume that made me wonder if I should be in therapy. 

**2/10**



# Neroli Botanica

**Notes -** 

**Top -** Pink Pepper, Ginger, Black Pepper, Turmeric

**Middle -** Orange Blossom, Jasmine, Neroli

**Base -** Sandalwood, Vetiver, Benzoin

I love the opening to this - a fresh, clean white floral with zero sweetness- a 'cold', outdoorsy floral vibe - picking up a slight fresh, tart spiciness from the ginger which really uplifts the neroli and jasmine.

As this dries down, the white florals smell super realistic- honeyed and creamy - I smell the jasmine more than the neroli but that is not a complaint from me!

Drydown has strong sillage, all white florals, with every whiff revealing a different facet.

On a second try I feel like this has a super dominant orange blossom note - I usually struggle with orange blossom but this is a great version of it - honeyed but not too sweet, beautifully floral.

This also lasts and smells beautiful on a hot day - a truly solid white flower bomb! I wore the last of this sample to a BBQ and got a couple of compliments - it was projecting!

**8/10**



# Fig Infusion

**Notes -** 

Fig, Sandalwood, Black Tea, Mandarin Orange, Cedar, Orange Blossom, Clementine, Benzoin, Freesia

Omg, it's love at first spray! Opening is fruity, green, creamy, a little sweet, reminds me of the [Gris Charnel](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/BDK-Parfums/Gris-Charnel-57038.html) opening with the vanilla removed and the green notes amped up - a summer version of Gris Charnel. I get beautiful juicy citrus notes with a touch a cedar as this dries down.

The drydown a few minutes in feels a bit more herbal/aromatic as the fruit of the opening fades - smells so much like cardamon to me, must be the tea note. The sandalwood is strong and milky. This is really beautiful and well-balanced - I love getting whiffs of this as I work!

The opening to this is definitely one of the best fig notes I've experienced (& I've been wearing a lot of fig samples recently) and the composition of this scent is so impressive. I just wish it lasted a little longer. This was gone without a trace by lunchtime, about 4 hours. I'm trying not to make longevity/performance as much of a factor in my perfume scores the more I learn about perfumes, and fig notes never last that long on me anyway. I would definitely recommend for fig lovers who don't mind the odd 'top up' to keep the scent fresh.

After several wears I can say this is one of the best fig perfumes I've ever tried- the sandalwood and tea notes are so beautiful. Addictive and universal- could wear this beauty in all weathers.

**9/10**



# Bois Imperial

**Notes -** 

Akigalawood, Woodsy Notes, Vetiver, Basil, Timur, Ambroxan, Patchouli

The opening to this is fresh and spicy, and I'm surprised there isn't a bergamot note there lifting this - I still can't place how woody notes are made to feel so fresh.

With the abundance of woody notes comes what is definitely a masculine-leaning scent, but very wearable to me (Orange X Santal felt more distractingly masculine to me). While I wouldn't recommend to women who love very feminine floral or sweet scents, I think this is unisex enough to carry off - I am pretty femme and comfortable with it.

The drydown is definitely a journey- the fresh spiciness evolves into a warm spice, and the base smells earthy, herbal, a touch oud-y- but not overwhelmingly so.

This is such an addictive scent - I keep on smelling my wrist half an hour in, I also have tonnes of sillage - fresh, woody, herbal, peppery, very clean.

This has a reputation for lasting all day but I could only smell on my wrist at lunch - I think my skin eats it up.

**7/10**



# Mon Vetitver

**Notes -** 

Haitian Vetiver, Lime, Gin, Juniper, Lavender, Cashmeran, Patchouli, Gentiana

Mmmm wow the opening for this is gorgeous- I'm sampling this on a hot, sunny day and this is beautifully fresh and clean, super aromatic with a burst of juicy zesty lime, it's definitely giving luxury hotel spa.

The gin and juniper is there but not strong, definitely a supporting character.

Drydown is woody vetitver but not smoky, with a touch of soapy brightness!

Fragrantica votes say this leans masculine but it's definitely unisex to my nose - I thought Orange X Santal & even Bois Imperial were far more masculine! This might be because of the gin note, a drink I link to femininity in my head. 

The drydown is beautiful and addictive with faint sillage an hour in - woody and fresh, so clean, not smoky. This makes me want to explore more vetiver perfumes.

I like this more than Bois Imperial!

This lasted a good six hours on me and was an experience I loved. I ended up wearing this again on a trip to London to a conference. I wanted to feel mature and put together and this was perfect - I smelled it on my clothes all day.

**9/10**



# Rose Magnetic

**Notes -** 

Turkish Rose, Rose, Litchi, Grapefruit, Vanilla, Mint, Tonka Bean, Cedar

Opening is a sweet and fruity rose - lots of lychee and grapefruit in the opening too - pretty easy wear if you like rose/fruit combos - good rose for hot weather, it's lifted and bright rather than cloying.

The note isn't listed but I actually get a touch of iris on the drydown, where the rose evolves to lose its sweetness and becomes a little powdery.

This dries down to a slightly spicy rose with touches of lychee and tonka bean. It's not my usual profile but I can't really fault it.

2.5 hours in and I'm not crazy about the longer-term drydown- still lots of powdery rose (& sillage - this really lasts), but the fruit notes have a strange, stale quality - it smells a touch 'vintage' when I prefer more modern takes on rose.

**5/10**



# Patchouli Mania

**Notes -** 

**Top -** Hazelnut, Davana, Coriander

**Middle -** Cacao, Tea, Clearwood

**Base -** Patchouli, Vetiver, Cetalox

This was the only sample in this set I was a bit scared of - I kept on putting off the test. Patchouli is a note I struggle with, [Angel](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Mugler/Angel-704.html) was one of the worst things I ever smelled -  but I can also appreciate it as a base note.

This is definitely a patchouli perfume on the opening (duh) but it isn't turning my stomach- the patchouli is supported by hazelnut and cacao - it's patchouli dipped in Nutella.

The strong patchouli does calm down and blend in the drydown- this bothersome earthy patchouli fades pretty fast and turns oddly clean (tea note?), not quite fresh - drydown is a balsamic, nutty dark chocolate on a clean vetiver base. There's even something slightly soapy in the drydown.

This is a weird scent but credit to Fabrice Pellegrin for making a patchouli-dominant fragrance that doesn't immediately turn my stomach. The cocoa note has a dark chocolate feel that reminds me of the nutty chocolate note in [Mancera's Choco Violette](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Mancera/Choco-Violette-42940.html).

About an hour in and all the funkiness of the patchouli is completely gone and I are left with a rich, yummy, nutty, chocolate scent - the sillage is quite 'perfumey' and vintage smelling- not my usual profile but definitely want to stick with it rather than scrub it off. 

This lasted about four hours on my skin.

**5/10**

This set was such a fun journey! I would absolutely recommend this set to any perfume nerds out there - I got it for a great price too.

I think...

But honestly I feel like I've been sacrificing everything for his pleasure and joy. From him always choosing the movies because what I like to watch is too boring(like Gibli/Gravity Falls/mostly stuff that is cartoons or isn't filled whit death blood or gore)
To only going out when he wants toor when he feels like it.

At first it was small things like buying headphones so I could listen to my calm music to help me sleep at night as its the one thing that helps me sleep whilst he watches random videos on YT to sleep. Apparently my music made it so he couldn't sleep and his vids made it so I couldn't sleep.

So I bought headphones for that and for when we're in the car as he loves putting music at like 16-18 so loud we can literally hear him leave and arrive.
He says its because hes fully deft from one hear.

I've also had to change everything we eat due to his allergies wich I understood.

I say We as im basically my mom's personal care taker right now.
My mom[55] is currently on a downwards spiral whit her body and memory. I have to constantly be there were she goes somewhere because She no longer can remember where anything is. She's also really not good whit technology and sometimes Google Maps is not 1000% accurate. And she also already need to use a cane due to minor accidents in the past so she needs help whit many stuff. In exchange I get a roof over my head and food.

Anyway back to my boyfriend. He's been very lasy due to his studies in plumbing behing allot for him but even now that hes out of school for the summer i have not seen any signs of him trying to pickup after himself.  I constantly pick up his clothes and the dishes he brings into MY bedroom when there's a table upstairs. I made his coffee each morning did his laundry and im basically the one cooking most of the time. And sometimes he just orders or does something else cus its not what he likes. Like I dont mind behing the 'stay at home wife' but some help would be nice and I told him as such.

Recently we've been renovating at my place and he as not helped once whit painting or moving furniture due to pain or feeling dizzy due to paint fumes wich I understand but I a person who is by definition a f*ing skeleton have been the one doing pretty much everything whit the help of my mom and brother [18m] who is probably leaving for college in September.
I've asked him twice if we could leave a day early after visiting his parents cus I wanted to finish everything as soon as possible but No he drives he decides.

The two breaking points that I've recently been boiling over is about my cats and our personal fun times.
He has cat allergies and had a nasty reaction to my cousin's cats a few months back but he was fine when we were at my place. [I have 2 cats] and he immediately eluded to getting rid of me and my mom's cat to give them but I talked him out of it. We bought a air filter and cleaned the WHOLE house we even made sure that the cats couldn't go downstairs anymore. And until now everything as been fine. We even had a sliding door installed to make extra sure. But today he eluded to getting rid of them again as his allergies were spiking again.

I just dont think I can't say yes they are technically my mom's cat. And they are my babies.[they are 8&9 in age]

And now for the uh adult fun time
Skip if its too much
Im a bottom in the relationship and hes a switch but cleaning everything as been very hard for me for a few years so I mostly rely on my mouth to pleasure him as my hands don't do Anything. At first he'd suck me back but im uh quite big and he as stopped I've mostly been masturbating in the shower. So he gets all the pleasures.

He's also been living whit us rent free since mid February.

I really don't know what to do l. I dont know if id ever find someone like him who understands that I cant move due to my mom. But again Im tired of giving up everything for him and playing maid.
He's been a very good help for my mental health and I for his. Im scared of what both of us would do if I did do it. Not helped by the fact that he as so much stuff at my place.

The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list landed in Turin, Italy, on June 19, 2025. It did not whisper. It roared. The top spots weren’t just kitchens. They were ideas, sharp and on fire. Your neighborhood spot can borrow from their brilliance. You do not need fame. You need focus, love, and grit.

Maido in Lima took first. Chef Mitsuharu “Micha” Tsumura stood tall. He said, “I think the most beautiful act of love is to cook for somebody. It’s the most beautiful thing that has happened in my life.”¹ He mixes Japanese craft with Peruvian soil. Sushi rice, ají peppers, native potatoes. Bold, simple, real. You can do this. Find one bold mix. Make it yours. Tell that story on the plate.

Asador Etxebarri followed. Chef Victor Arguinzoniz builds with fire. He said, “The aroma of wood smoke became etched in my memory when I was a child.”² He selects oak, cherry, and apple wood. Grilled scallops. Charms beef cheeks. Your turn. Choose a tool. A brick oven, a wood grill. Master it. Let it define your taste.

Quintonil in Mexico City claimed third. Jorge Vallejo cooks with his neighbors. Farmers bring him heirloom corn. Foragers hand him mushrooms. The dishes speak of land and labor. Build this. Name your farmer. Taste will follow.

At number four, DiverXO in Madrid throws the theater on the table. Chef Dabiz Muñoz bends sweet into sour. Sends dishes through dry ice clouds. Projects light onto the plates. It’s surreal. You can do something small. A dark room. One whispered story. A reveal under a cloche. Make it magic.

Fifth came Alchemist in Copenhagen. Rasmus Munk burns the script each month. New dishes. New themes. Guests don’t know what’s coming. That is the thrill. Do a weekly surprise dish. Post it online. See who returns.

Odette in Singapore ranked 25. Chef Julien Royer grows herbs onsite. He composts coffee grounds. His team wears recycled fabrics. He buys local. “Sustainability is not a trend, it is survival,” he told the Australian Financial Review.³ You can do this. Serve water in a glass. Filter oil for a second fry. Change one small thing. Then change one more.

Atomix in New York sits at 12. Chef Junghyun Park greets guests by name. Only 19 seats. It is soft, close, and deliberate. Park says, “We feed more than hunger, we feed belonging.”⁴ Your staff can remember birthdays. Favorite dishes. Write a note with the bill. Guests will come back.

Potong in Bangkok entered strongly at 13. Chef Pichaya Soontornyanakij walks five floors to her family’s old recipes. Her soups speak in Thai and Chinese. You can do this. Think of your roots. Put that memory on a chalkboard or a napkin. People will read it.

Ikoyi in London climbed to 15. Chef Jeremy Chan blends West African, Asian, and British traditions. No walls, no rules. He pairs palm oil with sea bass, then serves it on fine bone china. It works. If it tastes right, serve it. That’s the only law.

Septime in Paris took 40. It wears jeans, not suits. Wood tables, soft light. No linens. No formality. Just elegance in ease. Your place can feel like that. Lose the stiffness. Light a candle. Let your food breathe.

You don’t need stars. You need a soul. Pick one idea. One fire. One story. Own it with grit. Shine with heart. Then the people will come.

So what do i know about this comic?
Digital, color, it had panels on insta, it looked like a Bl romance comic. I would guess western author -but this is a guess-
One male character is blacked haired, fluffy hair. The other one is a redhead male.
The short part i could read before losing the post was: the black haired guy is in a coffee shop ordering his usual, the red hair barista sais he just started. To this the black haired guy starts to list on how many occasion the red hair is in the cafe when he is, and that he knows it is not a coincidence and if he now gives him his usual, then he will give to the red hair guy his number.
Huhh this is not much, sorry.

Every time I have coffee, even 1/4 a cup, my stomach blows up, my fatigue heightens, I feel light headed, lose my ability to focus etc. 

The weird thing is that caffeine from other sources (tea, sugar free energy drinks) doesn’t affect me in the same way. The energy drinks (which are awful for me I know) have similar caffeine to a double espresso coffee, but they don’t leave me feeling absolutely shit. 

Could this be an intolerance? Histamines? Mold? I’m not sure. I only drink high quality organic coffee.

Everyone would call out, “Dr. Gehad, emergency in the operating room!” But somehow, instead of an operating room, I found myself standing in a farm, with someone handing me a thermometer, saying, “Hey, Doc, check this cow’s temperature.”

Yes, I ended up in veterinary school a place that never even appeared in my worst nightmares. This wasn’t part of the plan. No, this felt more like a cosmic prank, as if the university admission system decided to test my ability to handle life’s unexpected plot twists.

I entered vet school the way an exile steps onto foreign land not out of love or passion, but because fate had spoken, and the education system had thrown me here like a rock into a well, without negotiation or consent.

I looked around at my new classmates, watching their eager smiles, their confident postures, as if they had finally found their life’s calling. Meanwhile, I was standing there, questioning everything.
“Were they like me? Did they also once dream of white coats and human hospitals, only to end up here surrounded by cows and goats? Or were they born loving farm animals?”

As I walked through the lecture halls, I heard words I had never imagined studying: parasites, poultry, ruminants! Where was human anatomy? Where were the heart and lungs? Where was the dramatic surgery scene from medical TV shows? Was my dream real, or just a cruel mirage?

I sat in my first lecture, still lost in my thoughts, wondering, Is there any chance I could transfer to human medicine?
And then, as if reading my mind, the professor’s voice echoed through the hall:
“Listen up, people! You’re in vet school now, and you’ll stay in vet school for life!”
Ah, if only he knew I never asked to be here. I only wanted a one-way ticket out!

Days passed, and I tried to adapt. I memorized veterinary drugs, learned how to examine animals, but deep inside, there was still a child holding on to an old dream. Every time I saw a human doctor, I couldn’t help but wonder:
What if?
What if I had scored higher?
What if I was in a hospital instead?
What if I could turn back time?
But in the end, I made peace with my fate. I realized I wasn’t alone many of us were navigating the same unexpected detour. Life doesn’t always go as planned; it goes the way it wants.

And so, after three years of shock and denial, I finally accepted my reality. I am a doctor now... just not for humans!

And if you ask me today how I feel about veterinary medicine, I’ll simply smile and say:

Saijo is self pollinating, a high producer, and astringent. Great. Done. (Theoretically. We shall see.) 

The Coffee Cake is giving me such a headache! It is not self-pollinating...or maybe it is? It won't make male flowers, unless it does. The fruit is astringent if it's unpollinated, and dark colored and non-astringent if it is pollinated. (So...it's self pollinating, to the point of making fruit, but needs a cross-pollination to be non-astringent??) 

I had thought the Saijo would cross pollinate with it, but now I don't think it will. Chocolate or Gosho is supposed to be a good cross pollinator, but will also give every persimmon in my ""orchard"" seeds. (And what does that mean?? Like, if my persimmon has 5-8 seeds in the middle like an apple, that's definitely not a deal breaker...)

I was placed under a Financial Management Order because I had spending habits that were extremely reckless, but my parents have control over my finances and I feel like they're trying to control me because they use my bank account to order things I don't need or want, like even more clothes when I get told by my support workers that I have more clothes than they do.

The other day my PlayStation broke down so I suggested getting a new one and my father told me that it was an expensive purchase, it's ultimately my finances, they shouldn't be able to make any choices regarding it, the reason why I was placed under a Financial Management Order was because I was buying $500 perfumes, which I've stopped buying perfumes all together, that addiction was replaced by buying video games, which I've stopped.

I don't understand why I'm still under a Financial Management Order if I've quit not one but two addictions, which is extremely hard to do.

I've discussed all of this with my case manager and she suggested getting it changed to a public guardian but my parents have had her removed as my case manager because of apparent mistakes that she made.

My point is that my parents are making me anxious by being in control over my finances, I understand why I'm under a Financial Management Order because I had spending habits that were extremely reckless but my parents are calling me every time they see a transaction on my bank account, even if it's from a cafe or Kmart or a nice restaurant, the financial management order has ruined my dating life and most of my regular life.",1,1751574326.0,disability,1,1.0,False

Please bring the Incinerator Corps back.","Firstly, I'd like to apologize for any lack of professionalism in my post or if it seems to ramble, as I'm still processing the grief and it's very emotional for me.

He was an exceptional military man, with a promising career as an officer ahead of him. He always refused, probably because he never absolved himself of the guilt he had when he served. Even after he left the military, he never stopped saving lives. He volunteered for his country's Civil Defense Force, constantly risking his life in emergency responses to gas explosions, natural disasters, and lots of other dangerous things.

Despite that, he always found the time to sit down with me and liberate a planet. We'd constantly talk about what was going on in our daily lives. We spent so much time on that Super Destroyer, looking out at the planet below. He even helped patch an old friendship of mine, the guy was the most supportive person I ever met. Whether it was in a Super Helldive or real life, every time I got knocked down he'd say, ""you can do it, I believe in you"". He'd often take coffee breaks on the Super Destroyer, obsessively drinking a Peppermint Mocha Latte between dives. I have to admit, after he convinced me to try one it was pretty good.

A while ago while my friend and I were diving, I had a silly small pipe dream. I wanted to start a Helldivers clan called the ""Super Earth Commandos"" (at the time I was reminiscing about Republic Commandos and why I was in love with the Viper Commando warbond). I didn't think much of it at the time, until I noticed he put (SEC) in his Steam name. The guy apparently would bring it up in lobbies with randoms and go around trying to help. What I'm trying to say is, the other Commandos and I really miss him.

I've seen him in action. Single handedly killing thousands upon thousands of Terminids every operation, hundreds of Automatons and Illuminate alike. The game was super important to him, and although we were separated by nationality, he was brother to me. Now I'll never get the chance to buy him a drink, or have him over for dinner to see the newborn. He'll never get the chance to settle down and have a family.

He pulled two children and a pregnant woman out of a three story house fire, suffering fourth degree burns. He went into a coma before passing away last Tuesday.

I think he died as he lived, a real hero, a real John Helldiver. Without him, there's a big hole he left behind that for the first time it's really hard to put into words. My friends and I want honor his memory. Admittedly the idea wasn't mine, but someone suggested the next time the Incinerator Corps show up, we're going to hunt.

## What is Trusorbot?

Trusorbot is an **automated trading platform** designed to help users trade cryptocurrencies and other assets with minimal manual effort. Think of it as your personal trading assistant that scans the markets 24/7, identifies profitable opportunities, and executes trades on your behalf. It’s particularly appealing to people who want to enter trading but lack the time or expertise to do it manually.

Unlike traditional trading platforms where you need to analyze charts and news constantly, Trusorbot uses algorithmic strategies to make decisions quickly. It’s similar to well-known bots like Bitcoin Code or Immediate Edge but aims to provide a more user-friendly experience with some handy features that make it stand out.

## Who Created Trusorbot?

The exact founders of Trusorbot aren’t widely publicized, which is fairly common in the trading bot space. However, the platform appears to be developed by a team of software engineers and financial experts with experience in crypto and algorithmic trading. This mix is crucial since building a reliable bot requires both technical skills and market know-how.

From what I gathered, the development team focuses on transparency and continuous improvement, frequently updating the software to keep up with market changes. While anonymity can raise eyebrows, the platform’s performance and user feedback suggest it’s not a fly-by-night operation, but always do your own due diligence.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Trusorbot Today](https://tinyurl.com/2bu3aqm9)
## How Does Trusorbot Work?

Trusorbot operates by connecting your trading account to partnered brokers via APIs. Once connected, the bot analyzes live market data using pre-set algorithms and machine learning techniques to identify trading signals. When a favorable opportunity arises, it executes buy or sell orders automatically.

The process is pretty straightforward: you set your preferences, risk levels, and trading parameters, then let the bot do the heavy lifting. It’s kind of like having a super-fast, tireless trader who never sleeps. The bot continuously monitors multiple assets, so it can switch strategies based on shifting market conditions, aiming to maximize profits and minimize losses.

## Trusorbot Pros and Cons

Here’s a quick rundown of what I liked and what could be improved:

**Pros:**
- Easy-to-use interface suitable for beginners
- Real-time market analysis and fast trade execution
- Supports multiple assets beyond just cryptocurrencies
- Mobile and desktop access for trading on the go
- Customizable alerts to keep you updated

**Cons:**
- Minimum deposit of $250 might be high for some newbies
- No publicly available detailed info about the development team
- Like all trading bots, it can't guarantee profits—market risks remain
- Some users might find advanced settings limited compared to pro platforms

Overall, it balances accessibility with functionality nicely, though you should never invest money you can’t afford to lose.

## What Devices Can be Used to Access Trusorbot?

One of the great things about Trusorbot is its **device flexibility**. You can access the platform on:

- **Desktop computers:** Windows and Mac browsers are fully supported.
- **Mobile devices:** Both iOS and Android apps are available, letting you trade or monitor your portfolio anywhere.

This means you’re not tied to a single device or location. The mobile app has a clean design that’s easy to navigate, perfect for checking your trades during a coffee break or commute. It’s reassuring to know that you can stay connected no matter where you are, which is crucial for timely trading decisions.

## Trusorbot – Supported Countries

Trusorbot aims to serve a **global user base**, but, like many trading platforms, it has some regional restrictions due to regulatory compliance. It’s available in most countries across Europe, North America, Australia, and parts of Asia. However, users from the United States, Canada, and some countries with strict financial regulations might face limitations or need to verify identity more thoroughly.

If you’re unsure whether Trusorbot is accessible in your country, the best step is to visit their official site and check the registration process. They also provide customer support to clarify country-specific questions.

## Trusorbot – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

Trusorbot’s **real-time market analysis** is one of its standout features. The bot continuously scans multiple markets and asset classes, processing vast amounts of data in seconds. This means it can spot trends and price patterns faster than a human could, giving you an edge.

This feature is essential because crypto and stock markets can shift rapidly. By acting on live data, Trusorbot helps you stay ahead and potentially capitalize on small price movements that add up over time.

### User-Friendly Interface

One thing I really appreciate about Trusorbot is how **user-friendly** it feels. The dashboard is clean, intuitive, and designed to make trading accessible even if you’re new to the scene. You don’t need to be a tech wizard or a market analyst to get started.

Settings and options are clearly labeled, and the platform offers helpful prompts and tutorials. This ease of use reduces the learning curve and makes it less intimidating to test automated trading.

### Mobile Accessibility

Like I mentioned earlier, Trusorbot’s **mobile app** is solid. It’s responsive, loads quickly, and offers almost all the functionality of the desktop version. You can set up trades, receive alerts, and monitor your account from your phone or tablet.

But there’s this crew of elderly folks who come in every morning, buy only coffee, telling stories in detail that can last up to 15 minutes. Sort of like:

“So I got the flat tire, had my son but the donut on then we realized the tire shop was closed, went to the diner next door and the waitress was rude, it’s sad because I knew the old owner for 30 years and that would have never gone down.“ etc.
