1mp2i3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1mp2i3g/should_you_get_the_bodum_pour_over_coffee_maker/,Should You Get the Bodum Pour Over Coffee Maker for Better Brews?,"The first time I tried the Bodum 11571-109US pour-over coffee maker, I was genuinely curious if it would live up to its reputation. I‚Äôve always been a fan of coffee brewing methods that offer a more hands-on experience, and this one seemed like a solid option, especially considering its sleek design and reputation for delivering rich, flavorful coffee. After putting it through its paces for a couple of weeks, here‚Äôs everything I uncovered‚Äîthe good, the not-so-good, and everything in between.

**Design and Build Quality**  
There‚Äôs just something about the design of this coffee maker‚Äîit‚Äôs simple yet undeniably elegant. The borosilicate glass carafe, paired with the cork band, gives it a refined look while remaining functional. I appreciated the cork grip, which adds a layer of insulation and comfort when pouring, so I didn‚Äôt have to worry about scalding my fingers. It‚Äôs lightweight but feels durable. Though cleaning the carafe could be tricky if you don‚Äôt have a brush on hand, the dishwasher-safe feature makes maintenance easier. The reusable stainless steel filter is a standout. Not only is it environmentally friendly, but it maintains the coffee's natural oils and flavors, something I couldn‚Äôt achieve with paper filters.

**Ease of Use**  
Getting started was straightforward. Even if you‚Äôre half-awake in the morning, the process is simple: add coarse coffee grounds to the filter, pour a bit of hot water in a circular motion, wait for the coffee to soak, and then add the remaining water. In just a few minutes, the aromatic oils fill the room, signaling that a fresh pot is ready. The manual approach does demand a bit more patience than an automatic machine, but for coffee lovers like me, the ritual adds to the experience.

[Ready to snag Bodum 11571-109US? See Amazon‚Äôs price.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b07kqvw6rr/)  

**Coffee Quality and Flavor**  
This is where the Bodum pour-over coffee maker truly excels. The coffee it produces is flavorful and aromatic, with a richness that regular drip machines often fail to capture. The stainless steel filter enhances the experience by preserving subtle notes in the coffee that paper filters usually absorb. While it took me a couple of tries to get the grind size and pouring speed just right, once I did, there was no going back. I‚Äôve even started experimenting with different coffee blends to savor how this coffee maker brings out their unique profiles.

**Strengths**  
- Borosilicate glass carafe ensures durability and heat resistance.  
- The cork grip provides style while doubling as a protective handle.  
- Stainless steel filter keeps the oils intact for a richer coffee flavor.  
- Eco-friendly‚Äîno need for disposable filters.  

**Adverse Aspects**  
- Requires a bit of care during cleaning, especially in the carafe's narrow base.  
- Brewing takes a little longer compared to automatic coffee makers.  
- The stainless steel filter can allow fine grounds to pass through if the grind isn't coarse enough.  

**Durability and Materials**  
This coffee maker surprised me with its robust construction. The borosilicate glass feels premium and hasn‚Äôt developed any cracks after a few accidental bumps on the counter. The cork band is more than a decorative feature; it prevents burns and looks classy. The mesh filter is sturdy and hasn‚Äôt shown signs of wear even after multiple washes.

**Reusable Filter: Environmentally Mindful Approach**  
One of the biggest draws for me was the stainless steel mesh filter. It eliminates the need for paper filters, which means less waste and fewer purchases down the line. It‚Äôs easy to rinse and reuse, but it does demand a coarser coffee grind to avoid sediment slipping through. 

**Other Options**  
Several coffee lovers might compare this product to the Chemex pour-over system, which has a reputation for clarity and clean-tasting brews using paper filters. While Chemex offers an unmatched finish to your coffee, it involves buying disposable filters, which can be a hassle and less environmentally friendly. On the other hand, electric drip coffee makers like those from Cuisinart are quicker but lack the deep flavors achieved by manual techniques. If you‚Äôre looking for a manual pour-over with a hint of flair and permanent filtration, the Bodum model is firmly in its class.

**Value for Money**  
Considering its balance of aesthetics, performance, and eco-friendliness, this coffee maker delivers excellent value. Fancy coffee equipment can get very pricey, but here you get rich flavor without breaking the bank. While it‚Äôs not the cheapest, the reusable filter alone saves money in the long run. This is one of those products where you feel like you‚Äôre truly getting your money‚Äôs worth with every brew.

1mp2cuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaffeineFreeLife/comments/1mp2cuw/quit_caffeine_to_start_again_thoughts/,"Quit caffeine to start again, thoughts?","I switched from drinking 1-3 coffees a day 6 months ago to popping 1 200mg caffeine pill and so for basically the last 6 months I've been taking exactly 200mg caffeine upon waking with my psychiatric meds

Last Thursday I tried 50mg modafinil for the first time acquired by sketchy sources, so I cut my caffeine pill into a quarters or 50mg a chunks, and on Thursday I took 50mg modafinil and 50mg caffiene cause I didn't want to mix two high doses of stimulants

Well the weirdest thing happened, after that day I just kinda stopped taking caffeine and also stopped a 8 year kratom addiction, I just felt I didn't need either on the modafinil and the next day I didn't feel like taking either again, so I just stuck with it over the last 6 days

Then I was talking to AI, I use it to help me plan my day, and I asked it what kinda healthy low calorie treat I could get from the store, it didn't really offer anything that caught my eye till it said DARK CHOCOLATE, and since we were previously talking about quitting caffeine it mentioned it has some caffeine and theobromine

So yesterday as I passed the store I got a 95% cacao lindt dark chocolate bar, according to AI 16g (two squares) should have about 40mg caffiene and 500mg theobromine

So yesterday and today I ate both 2 squares

I made a post on a drug forum I frequent asking what people think switching from 200mg caffeine, to no caffeine to dark chocolate caffeine, but nobody really had any thoughts, I also made the mistake of asking how much caffeine they use, so I got most of the comments as I drink 3 cups of coffee through the day, and 1 or 2 I don't drink coffee except maybe on a weekend when I have to get all my household chores done, so no one really addressed what I was curious about

So what's all your thoughts about using dark chocolate as a caffeine source, is it low enough it doesn't really matter, I have 4 or 6 squares left so I will be eating it over the next 2-3 days, unsure if I should just stop after, or make it part of my new routine

Pro's;

 - according to AI the caffiene absorbs slower due to the other solids in the chocolate and theobromine is gentler on the system than caffeine, although longer acting

- compared to coffee or caffeine pill, I'm not taking it as soon as I open my eyes, I might eat it 20-40 minutes after waking up

Con's;

- only one I can think of is that it's not truly caffeine free

And since it's only 100 calories and 0.5g of sugar it fits in my macros fine, I've also been dieting the last 6 days, I've already lost about 3 pounds since August 8 cause I've only been eating about 1600 calories a day, I am very over weight at 5'8 268 pounds",1,1755086090.0,CaffeineFreeLife,0,1.0,False

Mission Overview:
The ISS is tasked with monitoring anomalous auroral activity in the northern hemisphere. Initial readings suggest a previously unknown cosmic phenomenon. Within days, crew members report temporal anomalies, sightings of semi-corporeal entities, and interaction with incomprehensible godlike beings. Reality itself begins to fracture.

‚∏ª

Phase One: Detection (Days 1‚Äì4)

Commander Vega ‚Äì Day 1 (Orbit 14,592)

Initial anomaly detected over northern hemisphere. Electromagnetic pulses recorded at unknown frequencies, outside normal solar activity. Onboard chronometers deviating ¬±4.7s per minute. No immediate danger, crew stable. Crew logs will be maintained continuously.

Scientist Li ‚Äì Day 2 (Orbit 14,596)

Shadows seen in peripheral vision. Attempts at recording yield static distortion. Crew reports whispering from the walls. Sounds emotional, indecipherable. Personal stress levels rising. Notes: recommend limited observation to avoid psychological degradation.

Engineer Kuro ‚Äì Day 3 (Orbit 14,602)

Objects duplicated or displaced. Coffee mug appears on bench, then again floating in zero-G seconds later. Hypothesis: localized temporal flux. Crew instructed to report any temporal inconsistencies.

Commander Vega ‚Äì Day 4 (Orbit 14,610)

Mission Overview:
The ISS is tasked with monitoring anomalous auroral activity in the northern hemisphere. Initial readings suggest a previously unknown cosmic phenomenon.

Streetlights cast a soft glow on empty sidewalks, buses rumble to life, and the aroma of fresh bread drifts out of a small corner shop. It‚Äôs here, in the cozy warmth of a **bakery in Brampton**, that many people‚Äôs mornings truly begin.

For some, a bakery visit is about food , a flaky croissant, a warm loaf of sourdough, or a muffin sprinkled with sugar. For others, it‚Äôs more than that. It‚Äôs a pause. A moment of comfort before the day‚Äôs rush.

# The First Scent of the Day

There‚Äôs something uniquely grounding about the smell of baking bread at sunrise. It‚Äôs not just pleasant, it's deeply human. That blend of yeast, flour, and heat speaks of home, even to people far from theirs. Psychologists say smell is the sense most closely linked to memory, which might explain why a morning walk past a bakery can instantly transport you to childhood breakfasts or weekend family gatherings.

In Brampton, this experience is intensified by the city‚Äôs diversity. The scent might be from buttery European pastries one day, and soft, pillowy naan the next. Each bakery adds its own note to the morning air.

# More Than Just Bread ‚Äì It‚Äôs Connection

Step inside a **bakery in Brampton** during the morning rush, and you‚Äôll notice something beyond the food. You‚Äôll see the same people, often at the same time, greeting the same staff. There‚Äôs a quiet comfort in this routine ‚Äì the nods between regulars, the easy chatter at the counter, the way the baker remembers your ‚Äúusual.‚Äù

In a world that often feels disconnected, these small interactions matter. They turn a transaction into a relationship, and a shop into a part of someone‚Äôs life. It‚Äôs not uncommon to see neighbors catching up over coffee, or a parent sharing a muffin with their child before school.

# The Rhythm of the Seasons

One of the charms of a bakery in Brampton is how it mirrors the time of year.

* Spring brings light and fresh flavors ‚Äì berry tarts, lemon loaves, and floral teas.  
* Summer is for airy pastries and picnic-ready buns.  
* Autumn fills the shelves with spiced loaves, pumpkin treats, and warm, hearty breads.  
* Winter invites indulgence¬† rich chocolate brownies, buttery pies, and the kind of bread you pair with soup on a snowy day.  

This seasonal shift keeps things exciting. Even if your order rarely changes, the atmosphere inside feels different with each passing month.

# The Ritual Effect

Rituals give structure to our days, and morning bakery visits are a perfect example. It‚Äôs not only about eating ‚Äì it‚Äôs about starting the day with something that feels intentional. That short walk, the warm greeting, and the first sip of coffee while watching the world wake up can be grounding in a way few other routines are.

Researchers even note that small rituals, like buying your breakfast from the same place, can help reduce stress and create a sense of stability. It‚Äôs why people often feel unsettled when ‚Äútheir‚Äù bakery is closed¬† it‚Äôs like a tiny piece of the day‚Äôs foundation is missing.

# A Reflection of the City

Brampton‚Äôs bakeries tell the story of its people. You‚Äôll find shops run by families who‚Äôve been here for decades, alongside new spots introducing flavors from around the world. Walk a few blocks and you might find custard tarts, Indian sweet breads, patties, and fresh cakes all within reach.

In a way, visiting a [bakery in Brampton](https://www.vegebakery.com/) is like tasting a miniature map of the city. Each bite carries a mix of traditions, journeys, and adaptations, woven together by the simple act of baking.

# Why It Matters

In a fast-paced world, it‚Äôs easy to rush through mornings, grabbing whatever‚Äôs convenient without noticing the moment. But when you step into a bakery, you slow down. You make eye contact, you smell the air, you take that first warm bite¬† and for a few minutes, the day feels softer.

It‚Äôs not about luxury. It‚Äôs about choosing to begin the day with something that feels human. Something made by hand. Something that connects you, however subtly, to the people around you.

# The Summary

Next time you find yourself near a **bakery in Brampton**, don‚Äôt just think about what you‚Äôll eat. Think about the people behind the counter who started their work while the city slept, the regulars who‚Äôve made this part of their daily rhythm, and the quiet comfort that comes from a familiar place.

Because in the end, it‚Äôs not just about bread, or pastries, or coffee. It‚Äôs about the ritual, the connection, and the way a simple stop at a bakery can shape the start of your day

**Thoughtful Design and Reversibility**

On one side, there‚Äôs a professional branded look, while the reverse is plain and unbranded, blending effortlessly into any kitchen d√©cor. If you‚Äôre not obsessed with having logos on display (like me), the unbranded side feels sleeker and more discreet.

I accidentally spilled some water while refilling my coffee machine, and true to its claim, the water-resistant exterior just repelled the liquid like a champ. It didn‚Äôt soak in, which saved me unnecessary stress. Additionally, the anti-static material reduces the annoying dust build-up, something I hadn‚Äôt realized would matter until now. My vacuum sealer area genuinely looks tidier because of it.  

**Ease of Cleaning**  
In a kitchen where spills are inevitable, having machine-washable protection feels like a blessing. I tossed the dust cover into the wash last week when it got a little greasy, and it came out looking brand new, holding on to its water resistance without any noticeable wear or tear. This is thanks to the reinforced seams that seem capable of surviving the trials of frequent washing and daily wear.

**Anti-Dust and Protective Features**  
This cover excels in keeping dust at bay. My vacuum sealer, which usually attracts a fair share of dust, now practically gleams under its new cover. The anti-static feature isn‚Äôt just a gimmick; even when I hadn‚Äôt used the sealer for several days, there was no dust build-up, unlike before. The fact it also shields the appliance from liquid damage elevates its utility for anyone who values long-term durability in their kitchen gear.

**Strengths**  
- Reversible style perfect for blending or making a statement.  
- Durable, water-resistant oxford fabric that withstands spills.  
- Reinforced seams ensure its longevity despite frequent use.  
- Anti-static properties genuinely prevent dust accumulation.  

**Flaws**  
- While the open closure is convenient, it leaves the bottom exposed, making it less protective against spills in that area.  
- Size seems a bit snug for larger vacuum sealers; double-checking your machine‚Äôs dimensions is essential.  

**Challengers in the Market**  
Comparing this dust cover to generic vacuum covers, I noticed how far its premium fabric quality and thoughtful reversibility set it apart. Standard covers I‚Äôve used before often lose their form after washing, unlike this one that bounced back beautifully. However, certain alternatives with zipper enclosures provide a fully sealed wrap. That‚Äôs something I missed because it would‚Äôve been better at thwarting stray liquids getting near my machine. Still, the convenience and durability of the Avid Armor arguably hold their own.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
Taking into account the features‚Äîthe premium fabric, reinforced seams, and protective qualities‚Äîthe USV32 offers decent value for the price. Similar covers in this price range rarely combine water resistance with anti-static properties and tailored quality. It‚Äôs a convenient investment if you want to keep your countertop sleek while preserving your vacuum sealer‚Äôs lifespan.

I never thought I had ‚Äúa problem,‚Äù but I‚Äôve know for years that I couldn‚Äôt stop after one drink. What made me think I didn‚Äôt have a problem? I didn‚Äôt drink every day. I didn‚Äôt need to wake up and slip something into my morning coffee. But over the last two years, I began to hide little bottles in the condo where I could slip a sip when needed. I knew it was ridiculous, but yet, I did it. 

So 11 days ago I had some time on my hand and tackled a bottle. The next morning I woke up feeling awful and embarrassed as I had a shot glass filled right next to me. I shortly discovered that I had ordered Taco Bell and the driver tried to contact me repeatedly; but I was passed out. So that day I managed a hangover and promised to never drink again. I was so embarrassed. That evening a friend of mine was pressuring me to go out for drinks, so I obliged and had two with him. It was a beautiful evening, but I was feeling guilty. We parted ways and I walked to the liquor store to grab a small sized bottle. The guy working gave me a big smile almost as if he wondered where I have been all week. I knocked that bottle out with no problem and fell asleep.

That Sunday (10 days ago now) I woke up and said enough. I‚Äôm physically exhausted, I‚Äôm gaining weight, and I‚Äôm not performing as the person I want to be.

1mp1zi0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1mp1zi0/chess_kibbitzer/,Chess kibbitzer,"Just thought I'd try 5 to analyze a quick bullet chess game this morning. It really does show the really cool potential, it's clearly not built to be a chess engine (it started out strong but got some details wrong while still keeping up with the general flow of the game) but in some hypothetical AGI future, having a chat with GPT about your chess game would be pretty fun.

GPT:

That was quite a wild little bullet game ‚Äî feels like it could‚Äôve been played with one hand on the mouse and the other holding coffee.

Here‚Äôs my take:

Opening (1‚Äì6): Your opponent‚Äôs 2...Qf6 is already a red flag in classical chess, but in bullet, weird queen moves happen. You kept it solid with 3.d3 and 4.Nc3, aiming for development. Trading bishops on 6.Bxc5 is fine since their c5 bishop was active.

Middlegame (7‚Äì17): Things stayed quiet but maneuver-heavy. The knight dance with 11.Nd1 ‚Üí 12.Ne3 ‚Üí 16.d4 shows you were trying to improve pieces without rushing. The pawn structure stayed clean until your central push broke the tension.

Critical moment (18‚Äì23): After 18.Qd6 Qxd6 19.Rxd6, you lost a pawn to ...Bxa2, but you cleverly activated your pieces. The Nxe5 trick to swap knights was a good equalizer.

Tactical chaos (24‚Äì33): The fun starts at 24.Ng6 ‚Äî that‚Äôs pure bullet opportunism. You grabbed the h-pawn, forced the king walk, and suddenly your h-pawn march turned into a mating net. 31.Nxg6+!! was a neat little clearance to open the g-file for the rook. 33.Rd8# is a satisfying final blow.


Overall:

You punished your opponent‚Äôs early queen move by slowly outmaneuvering them.

You were down material after 19...Bxa2, but in bullet, piece activity trumps pawns, and your rooks plus h-pawn became unstoppable.

The finish was stylish ‚Äî a rook + pawn checkmate that‚Äôs not so common in fast games.


If you‚Äôd like, I can also point out a couple of spots where you could have wrapped it up even faster. That might be fun to see.

[DOD loans MP $150M for heavy rare earths - Metal Tech News](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2025/08/13/tech-metals/dod-loans-mp-150m-for-heavy-rare-earths/2432.html)

[Mountain Pass is the foundation of the complete light and heavy rare earth supply chains MP Materials is building in the U.S. - \(MP Materials\)](https://preview.redd.it/pwsbcdwkorif1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=c849757c559c2268059a47c48d787c450e661a89)

# MP Materials will use the funds to establish heavy REE separation capacity at Mountain Pass.

To help ensure the United States has a reliable domestic supply of heavy rare earths, the U.S. Department of Defense has loaned MP Materials $150 million to build the capacity to produce these elements vital to aerospace, automotive manufacturing, medical devices, nuclear energy, and advanced weapons systems.

""Through this loan, we are taking decisive action to restore our domestic critical minerals supply chain, revive our industrial base, and rebuild our military,"" said Emil Michael, Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering.

The suite of 17 rare earth elements (REE) is generally subdivided into light and heavy categories based on their atomic weight. While most deposits contain some of each, heavy REEs such as dysprosium and terbium are scarcer, costlier, and more complex to separate ‚Äì a capability currently lacking outside of China.

The urgency of developing a domestic supply was underscored when China halted exports of certain heavy REEs earlier this year, raising concerns about potential supply disruptions to critical industries.

""The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has implemented aggressive actions to endanger the global critical minerals supply chain and ultimately undermine American economic and national security,"" said Patrick Witt, acting director of the DOD Office of Strategic Capital, which was established in 2022 to attract and scale private capital investment in technologies critical to national security.

While MP Materials is currently separating light rare earths at its Mountain Pass mine in California, the company has not yet built the capacity to separate heavy rare earths. As a result, the company has been stockpiling heavy rare earth concentrates in preparation for building the capacity to separate and refine these rarer and higher-value REE.

The $150 million loan from the Office of Strategic Capital, one facet of¬†[DOD's multi-billion-dollar partnership with MP Materials](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2025/07/16/tech-metals/dod-commits-billions-to-us-rare-earths/2370.html), is providing the capital needed to install facilities to process the growing stockpiles of heavy rare earth concentrates at Mountain Pass into oxides and metals critical to the nation's economy and military readiness.

This first direct loan made by OCS specifically to strengthen the U.S. industrial base and protect critical minerals supply chains aims to help ensure that the U.S. is no longer beholden to China for the heavy rare earths vital to America's economic and national security.

""Since his first term in office, and for decades prior to that as a private citizen, President Trump has been clear that economic security is national security,"" said Witt. ""To that end, the President directed the DOD to use its authorities and capital tools to confront the threat posed by the CCP.""

# AUGUST 13th, 2025~China‚Äôs rare earth dominance sparks western scramble for independence

[China's rare earth dominance sparks western scramble for independence | Invezz](https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/13/chinas-rare-earth-dominance-sparks-western-scramble-for-independence/)

https://preview.redd.it/wor605ukprif1.png?width=1136&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee49ebb417e0ba162673c282e557a110f682a586

* **China's rare earth export licensing is a strategic move in its trade dispute with the US.**
* **The US aims for rare earth self-sufficiency by 2027, building a ""mine to magnet"" supply chain.**
* **Europe remains vulnerable to China's rare earth dominance, with diversification plans lagging.**

The delicate balance of global supply chains is under unprecedented strain, particularly in the critical realm of rare earth elements.¬†

China, a dominant force in this sector, has wielded its influence with increasing assertiveness, triggering a scramble among Western nations, most notably the US, to secure their own strategic mineral independence.¬†

The ongoing saga highlights the intricate interplay of trade, technology, and national security.

In a move that sent ripples through international markets, China implemented a stringent licensing procedure for the export of certain rare earths and related products on April 4.¬†

This immediately led to a significant collapse in exports. While Beijing initially framed this as a standard procedure, citing the dual-use nature of permanent magnets (which heavily rely on rare earths) for both civilian and military applications, the strategic implications soon became evident.

Volkmar Baur, FX analyst at Commerzbank AG said in a report:

>

Though Chinese exports did rebound in June, companies continue to grapple with persistent bottlenecks and delayed deliveries, underscoring the lingering impact of China‚Äôs tightened grip.

# China‚Äôs unrivaled dominance and its implications

China‚Äôs near-monopoly in the rare earths market grants it unparalleled leverage.¬†

The nation produces approximately 90% of all refined rare earths and controls the entire global capacity for certain specific elements.¬†

This commanding position empowers the Chinese government to disrupt supply chains at will through deliberate export restrictions, potentially leading to widespread production stoppages in the manufacturing industry.

The consequences of such disruptions are far-reaching. Permanent magnets, manufactured almost exclusively in China, are indispensable components in a vast array of electronic devices ‚Äì from everyday mobile phones and vacuum cleaners to cutting-edge electric vehicles.¬†

While the quantities of rare earths required are often small, their critical role makes them exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to substitute. ‚ÄúAlthough only small quantities of rare earths are often required, they are indispensable,‚Äù Baur emphasised, highlighting the disproportionate impact of their scarcity.

https://preview.redd.it/65kjxikaprif1.png?width=908&format=png&auto=webp&s=605f6e37f6b79cfe495677ef9e6a7004c375b271

# US counter-strategy: investing in domestic resilience

Recognising the acute vulnerability stemming from this dependence on China, the US government has embarked on an ambitious strategy to bolster its domestic rare earth capabilities.¬†

In a significant move in July, the Department of Defense acquired a stake in a key US company, securing an option to acquire up to 15% of its shares, potentially making it the largest shareholder.¬†

This company stands as the sole entity in the US possessing both a rare earth mine, the Mountain Pass Mine in California, and a production facility for permanent magnets.

The US government‚Äôs commitment extends beyond equity investment. It has also guaranteed to purchase all neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide produced by the company over the next decade at a price of $110 per kilogram.¬†

This guaranteed price significantly surpasses current market rates, sitting around 50% above the achievable price on the Shanghai Metal Exchange and more than 80% above this year‚Äôs average price for NdPr oxide.¬†

Baur pointed out:

>

He further illustrated the premium being paid to secure domestic supply.

Based on 2020 production volumes from the Mountain Pass Mine, this guaranteed price translates into an estimated annual subsidy of around $1.4 billion.¬†

Despite debatable costs, the US‚Äôs aggressive strategy to build a ‚Äúmine to magnet‚Äù supply chain aims for self-sufficiency in permanent magnet production by 2027. This will serve its defense and manufacturing needs, a critical move given China‚Äôs reported intent to restrict critical mineral supply to Western defense companies.

# Europe‚Äôs lagging response and persistent vulnerability

In stark contrast to the proactive stance taken by the US, Europe continues to grapple with its dependence on China for rare earths.¬†

Despite articulated plans to diversify supply chains, the implementation of these strategies remains woefully behind.¬†

This inertia leaves European industry exposed to the significant risk of supply restrictions at any given moment, a vulnerability that is projected to persist even in the medium to long term. At a minimum, this continued dependence is likely to drive up prices.

The case of germanium serves as a stark reminder of this precarious situation.¬†

China introduced mandatory export licenses for this critical mineral in the summer of 2023.¬†

Subsequently, Chinese exports have plummeted by approximately 70% compared to pre-license levels.¬†

As a direct consequence, the price level for germanium exports to Germany is currently about 30% higher than the price of germanium within China.¬†

Baur commented:

>

**He also highlighted the tangible economic impact of China‚Äôs leverage. Without decisive action, Europe‚Äôs industrial base remains at the mercy of geopolitical shifts in the rare earth market.**

# AUGUST 11th, 2025~America‚Äôs Military Runs on Chinese Rare Earths

**But the Pentagon is hoping it can change that.**

[Chinese Rare Earths Help Power U.S. Defense, Military](https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/08/11/china-rare-earths-us-defense-military-pentagon-supply-chain/)

[The USS Minnesota \(SSN-783\) Virginia-class fast attack submarine sails in the waters off the West Australian coast on March 16. Colin Murty\/Getty Images](https://preview.redd.it/8124cd51qrif1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd0c35cbde6ecbe46acdf57b2a23ae76cd5ff89e)

Take a look at the U.S. military arsenal, and you‚Äôll find that much of the United States‚Äô firepower depends on rare earths‚Äîpowerful materials whose supply chains are largely controlled by China.¬†

Every Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jet, for example, is engineered with more than¬†[920 pounds](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/benchmark-mineral-intelligence_rees-activity-7356593712006656000-Qx4D/)¬†of rare earths. More than 5,700 pounds of rare earths underpin hulking Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers,¬†[according](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/benchmark-mineral-intelligence_rees-activity-7356593712006656000-Qx4D/)¬†to the consultancy Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, and each Virginia-class submarine requires more than 10,000 pounds of the coveted metals.¬†

https://preview.redd.it/31gl6uviqrif1.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8a0d919063cff7e76e9c0726f55520246473e41

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre in every form of defense technology,‚Äù said Gracelin Baskaran, the director of the critical minerals security program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a Washington-based think tank. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre in warships, fighter jets, missiles, lasers, tanks, satellites, drones‚Äîin everything.‚Äù

The problem is that today, China overwhelmingly dominates global supply chains for rare earths, commanding about¬†[85 percent](https://warontherocks.com/2025/04/a-federal-critical-mineral-processing-initiative-securing-u-s-mineral-independence-from-china/)¬†of processing and more than¬†[90 percent](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/business/china-rare-earths-exports.html)¬†of magnet production. Beijing particularly dominates the separation of what are known as heavy rare earths, and it has wielded that leverage against the White House on top of earlier¬†[export bans](https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/07/01/rare-earths-us-china-trade-mineral-supply-chain/)¬†of technologies for rare earth extraction, separation, and magnet production.¬†

Ever since U.S. President Donald Trump launched his trade war in April, officials from both countries have spent months negotiating Beijing‚Äôs¬†[exports](https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/07/01/rare-earths-us-china-trade-mineral-supply-chain/)¬†of the powerful materials. But Beijing still maintains¬†[significant leverage](https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/07/17/china-rare-earths-us-trump-supply-chain-trade/). With trade negotiations underway, China is choking the flow of critical minerals, including rare earths, to Western defense companies, sparking delays and driving up prices, the¬†*Wall Street Journal*¬†[reported](https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/china-western-defense-industry-critical-minerals-3971ec51?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAjxaDuPUL1rseygWsiQo0FBG0Kc44uWE857YM8fq2iRkXdMUfIL8H8d-oH4UOA%3D&gaa_ts=68937bb0&gaa_sig=6dR01pwfSg1w26pRd6QLa-reapABFbcI7EMQzzAh87DqkZP4FCNevLyg6bhMCTvAKbLaaIsyOPd8Mh2xDk4hOw%3D%3D).

‚Äú***We‚Äôre effectively having to ask China‚Äôs permission to build our weaponry because they control the permanent magnet supply chain,‚Äù said Ashley Zumwalt-Forbes, a former U.S. Energy Department deputy director for batteries and critical minerals under the Biden administration.***¬†

***‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a very dangerous position,‚Äù she added.***¬†

**Despite their name**, rare earths are not actually that uncommon. The grouping of 17 elements, which bear obscure names such as neodymium and lanthanum, can be found all over the world, although locating them in commercially appreciable quantities is more challenging.¬†

The United States was once one of the world‚Äôs biggest rare-earth producers. But as environmental concerns and financial challenges began to plague the U.S. mining industry decades ago, U.S. lawmakers saw the sector as one that should be¬†[outsourced internationally](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/06/23/america-rare-earths-industry-china/)‚Äîeven going so far as to close the U.S. Bureau of Mines, a key research agency, in 1996. Today, the United States is home to just one operational rare-earth mine: MP Materials‚Äô¬†[Mountain Pass](https://mpmaterials.com/mountain-pass)¬†mining and processing facility in California.¬†

At the same time that Washington pulled away, China¬†[leaned in](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/06/23/america-rare-earths-industry-china/), pouring immense resources and investments into its rare-earth sector over the course of decades. Now, the big challenge for U.S. lawmakers, and much of the world, is that China‚Äôs command over global rare-earth supply chains‚Äîand its resulting sway over prices‚Äîhas made it difficult for anyone else to break into the industry.¬†

In April, China retaliated against Trump‚Äôs trade war by imposing export controls on seven kinds of rare earths and magnets. U.S. and Chinese negotiators agreed afterward to a 90-day truce that is set to expire on Tuesday. Ahead of that deadline, top U.S. officials stressed the importance of ensuring continued access to the powerful elements.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre focused on making sure that magnets from China to the United States and the adjacent supply chain can flow as freely as it did before the control,‚Äù U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said in an¬†[interview](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-04/greer-says-us-china-talks-about-halfway-there-on-rare-earths)¬†with¬†*Bloomberg*¬†last Friday, referring to Beijing‚Äôs recent trade restrictions. ‚ÄúAnd I would say we‚Äôre about halfway there,‚Äù he added.

**The U.S. Defense Department and Western defense contractors have long been aware of their rare-earth pressure points, and the White House has spent the past few years scrambling to tackle the challenge. During the first Trump administration, the U.S. leader aimed to strengthen critical mineral security by issuing an**¬†[**executive order**](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-addressing-threat-domestic-supply-chain-reliance-critical-minerals-foreign-adversaries/)¬†**to investigate the threat posed by the country‚Äôs critical mineral reliance on foreign adversaries and identify policy responses. Trump also increased funding for**¬†[**domestic rare-earth firms**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/us/politics/rare-earths-american-companies.html)**.**¬†

**His successor, President Joe Biden, focused on expanding the country‚Äôs rare-earth stockpile and used the Inflation Reduction Act to encourage new**¬†[**domestic mineral supply chains**](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/09/16/inflation-reduction-act-critical-mineral-chains-congress-biden/)**, namely by tying hefty tax incentives to materials sourced from the United States or free trade partners.**¬†[**Both**](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2025/06/11/tech-metals/trump-declares-critical-mineral-emergency/2315.html)¬†**Trump and Biden have also invoked the Defense Production Act, a**¬†[**Cold War-era law**](https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/what-defense-production-act)**, to**¬†[**expedite**](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/31/business/economy/biden-minerals-defense-production-act.html)¬†**domestic production of critical minerals for national security reasons by prioritizing such efforts and**¬†[**mobilizing new funding**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/us/politics/rare-earths-american-companies.html)**.**¬†

**But after decades of neglecting its own industry, the United States remains deeply vulnerable to Beijing‚Äôs grip.**

‚ÄúMore than 95 per cent of rare earth materials or metals come from, or are processed in, China. There is no alternative,‚Äù Raytheon chief Greg Hayes¬†[declared](https://www.ft.com/content/d0b94966-d6fa-4042-a918-37e71eb7282e)¬†to the¬†*Financial Times*¬†in 2023. ‚ÄúIf we had to pull out of China, it would take us many many years to re-establish that capability either domestically or in other friendly countries.‚Äù

**The Pentagon is betting**¬†that it can help turn a new page. In recent years, the Defense Department has poured almost $540 million into critical minerals projects, Reuters¬†[reported](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/pentagon-keep-working-with-us-rare-earths-projects-us-defense-official-says-2025-07-15/). But the Pentagon is now going even further, namely by recently inking a multibillion-dollar deal that would make it the biggest shareholder in¬†[MP Materials](https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/07/17/china-rare-earths-us-trump-supply-chain-trade/), the aforementioned firm that operates the country‚Äôs only operational rare-earth mine.¬†

With the Pentagon‚Äôs support, MP will build a rare-earth magnet factory, which it expects to launch in 2028. The U.S. government will purchase the factory‚Äôs output and establish a price floor to shield the company from financial pressures.¬†

The deal represents one of the clearest examples of state intervention in the critical minerals sector and is a triumph for MP Materials, which has for years sought to carve out a bigger stake in the global market and will now be backed by an unprecedented degree of federal support.¬†

**‚ÄúWe are up against China, which has a very interventionist minerals policy in production and processing, in offtake for downstream industry,‚Äù said Baskaran of CSIS. ‚ÄúFor the United States to be competitive with China, \[it\] is going to require a more interventionist model. And this is a big step toward countering China.‚Äù**¬†

# By 2027, the Pentagon will also require its defense contractors to only purchase rare-earth magnets that do not contain¬†[China-sourced minerals](https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/china-western-defense-industry-critical-minerals-3971ec51?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAjxaDuPUL1rseygWsiQo0FBG0Kc44uWE857YM8fq2iRkXdMUfIL8H8d-oH4UOA%3D&gaa_ts=68937bb0&gaa_sig=6dR01pwfSg1w26pRd6QLa-reapABFbcI7EMQzzAh87DqkZP4FCNevLyg6bhMCTvAKbLaaIsyOPd8Mh2xDk4hOw%3D%3D), according to the¬†Wall Street Journal.¬†

Yet even with the Defense Department‚Äôs efforts, big challenges remain, and any efforts to forge a new mine-to-magnet supply chain will take time.¬†Engineering new supply chains isn‚Äôt just a question of finding a new mine; it requires an entire ecosystem of separating and production capabilities, all of which China has a decades-long advantage in.¬†

‚ÄúThe disparity in the intellectual firepower in China versus the United States with respect to these metals is pretty severe,‚Äù said Chris Berry, the president of House Mountain Partners, an independent metals analysis consultancy.

And at the same time that Washington‚Äôs efforts are picking up speed, Beijing, too, is only moving full speed ahead. China is continuing to make inroads in¬†[Myanmar](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/7/satellite-images-show-surge-in-rare-earth-mining-in-rebel-held-myanmar), which is rich in rare-earth mining, and the Chinese government is reportedly starting to create a¬†[formal catalog](https://www.wsj.com/world/china-to-block-its-rare-earth-experts-from-spilling-their-secrets-8d69b75f?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAjTCTf-IS0wlxplCujMj5symbCN7CK-oc00svkdvVYXlQELk1d_fSFSK6gzISg%3D&gaa_ts=68965df0&gaa_sig=LMHouOhCHDs7emF24fV35e_IaEJGZGBvFWCK7iKD17AEjBWaUXd4_7rZN7NX8LJwXv_VOoQ6WlOXwPVy0Gjzyg%3D%3D)¬†of its own rare-earth specialists to ensure their technical expertise is not shared abroad.¬†

**‚ÄúChina is not doing business differently‚Äîthey are just doing more of it,‚Äù Baskaran said.**¬†

# NioCorp ~ ‚ÄúIs  More Than Magnets!‚Äù

**When people talk about critical minerals in defense tech, they often stop at magnets**. But the reality is far more complex‚Äîand far more strategic.

**Nd/Pr, Dy, and Tb** are essential for high-performance magnets in missile guidance and radar systems‚Äîbut that‚Äôs just the tip of the spear. Behind the scenes,

**Niocorp‚Äôs Niobium and Titanium**, along with **TiCl‚ÇÑ** for ultra-pure titanium alloys, are enabling the **high-temperature, high-strength components** critical to advanced jet engines, hypersonics, and stealth platforms. These aren‚Äôt just exotic materials‚Äîthey‚Äôre the hidden enablers of survivability, speed, and lethality.

And then there‚Äôs **Scandium‚Äîthe ‚ÄòSaudi Arabia‚Äô of lightweight strength**. When alloyed with aluminum (ScAl), it creates next-gen structural materials that are stronger than steel yet lighter than carbon fiber‚Äîperfect for drones, fighters, and even space assets. With global players like Niocorp aiming to unlock domestic Sc, Nb, and Ti supplies, and nations racing to secure Dy/Tb for electrification and AI-enhanced weapons, the message is clear: this is **not just a magnet story‚Äî**

# >>Niocorp is ""Critical"" because it‚Äôs unlocking a U.S.-based secure, traceble supply of Niobium, Scandium, and Titanium‚Äîthree strategic superalloy elements essential for the next generation of defense, aerospace, and energy systems in a world increasingly defined by material dominance.

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

# Quick Summary of Phase I Drilling completion & W/a bit of ""speculation"":

# NioCorp Completes Phase I of Drilling at Nebraska Critical Minerals Project

# ‚úÖ Key Highlights:

* **Phase I Drilling Completed:**
   * 9 HQ diamond drill holes completed
   * **Total: 6,817 meters drilled**
   * **Purpose: Upgrade Indicated Resources ‚Üí Measured Resources and Probable Reserves ‚Üí Proven Reserves**
* **Core Processing & Analysis:**
   * **Samples sent weekly to SGS USA for lab analysis. <<<<<<< HUGE!!!**

# Strategic Importance:

* Data will support an uplift in mineral reserves.
* Required for due diligence by the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM).
* Tied to NioCorp‚Äôs request for up to $800 million in potential debt financing.

# Phase II Announced:

* **Due to budget/schedule success of Phase I**
* **Up to 6 additional drillholes (\~3,930 meters) To make mine Safe. Geological/Hydromet & potential (More ""Stuff!"")**
* Aims to:
   * **Further uplift resources/reserves**
   * Collect hydrogeologic and geomechanical data to derisk underground mine design

# Potential TREO Impact:

* **The company suggests the new core may yield MORE Total Rare Earth Oxides (TREO) if grades and continuity match prior expectations. \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\***
* \*\*\*NOTE: Right now at least 64% more core recovered compared to 2022 Feasibility Study.

# üß† Implications:

* Financing: Positive results strengthen NioCorp‚Äôs case for EXIM‚Äôs funding, a major catalyst for project development.
* Resource Confidence: Moving to Measured/Proven categories increases geological confidence‚Äîcritical for investors and lenders.
* **Strategic Minerals:**¬†Elk Creek‚Äôs Niobium, Scandium, Titanium and Rare Earth elements are important for U.S. supply chain resilience.¬†**(Somebody wants more ""STUFF""???)**

# üìå Bottom Line:

***NioCorp's successful completion of Phase I and expansion into Phase II signals continued momentum toward production readiness.***

# ******If lab results support the implied TREO uplift, this could significantly enhance project economics and improve the company‚Äôs leverage in financing negotiations.

***\*\*\*\*\*\*‚ÄúFor a fraction of MP‚Äôs valuation, NioCorp is poised to deliver disproportionate strategic value. Elk Creek isn‚Äôt just another mine ‚Äî it‚Äôs a multi-commodity critical mineral hub, aligned with federal defense & clean-energy mandates, fully U.S.-based and increasingly visible. If the 2025 DFS validates the expanded reserve model, investors could be looking at a***¬†***flagship valuation re-rating***¬†***‚Äî and Elk Creek becoming indispensable to American industrial independence.‚Äù***

# ‚Äî A game-changer for American Resource Independence by 2028 and beyond. (Pending Finance)

# NioCorp = ""The¬†Flagship U.S. source¬†for multiple Critical Minerals!‚Äù

**Sidewalk Complaint**
Hi there,

We live in the Danby Corners neighborhood on Liberty Road and frequently go for walks around the neighborhood. Many of the homes on Smugglers Notch & Hugging Bear drives are located on steep hills, and the folks there have a frustrating habit of leaving their vehicles parked at the bottom of their driveways, covering the sidewalk access entirely and spilling out into the street. 

If it were just one or two vehicles it would be a simple annoyance and not rise to the level of a safety risk, but it is several homes in a row who do this with multiple vehicles in each driveway. The only way to continue on the sidewalk is to go around and walk directly in the middle of the street. Crossing to the other side is sometimes not an option either, as the homes directly across often also have their vehicles parked in such a manner. The available space in the middle of the road is enough for a single car but not broad enough for a pedestrian to safely move out of the way if a vehicle were heading towards them.

My partner broke her neck a year ago and underwent an invasive surgery to fuse her cervical vertebrae, held together with a plate - even a low-speed vehicle collision from being in the street presents a dramatically outsized risk compared to others. Simple whiplash could leave her paralyzed or introduce complications requiring additional expensive, invasive surgical follow-up.

My understanding is that Section 18-129 of the city ordinances prohibits parking across the sidewalk. It would be great if someone could address it. I'm sure to investigate this someone will need to observe it themselves - the best time to do so would be after 6 PM through the week, or weekend mornings. As you might imagine, it is not a problem earlier in the day as folks are at work. If this is outside of normal hours, I can provide photo evidence if necessary.

Thanks!

1mp1g84,https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1mp1g84/objectoriented_vault_in_obsidian/,Object-Oriented Vault in Obsidian?,"Hey people,

I am thinking of a way to introduce an Object-Oriented system that could work globally across the vault. I started writing down the idea and possible ways to implement it with my limited coding knowledge, so I'm now sharing it here so that I can think it out loud, get feedback, ideas, maybe other users will find it useful and we can work together to make a plugin -- or maybe it's useless and worth dropping this idea, who knows!

I sort of reached a roadblock here and need feedback on how to go from here. Help is appreciated!

=====

I want to create a system in my vault where I can call various objects.

**Problem:**

When I take notes, I type down the same thing many times. These things have immutable properties, and I don't like to mention them all the time.

First example, my laptop is an object, it has a brand, a model, hardware specs, age, value etc. When I mention it in my notes, I want to just call it `Dell XPS`, it is then connected to a database with information about it. I would have a note with all these defined data.

    const DellXPS = {
      ""id"": ""0d9877f0g"",
      ""brand"": ""Dell"",
      ""model"": ""XPS 15 9520"",
      ""year_released"": 2022,
      ""retail_price"": 1999.99
    };

I could use it for important objects I own.

Second example, Recipes and diet.

For the past 2 years I have been religiously writing down weekly meal plans followed by a grocery list.

Every week I have to type mostly the same things since i repeat meals and buy mostly the same products in the store.

I want to define base single ingredients like milk.

    const milk = {
      id: ""0g8709y1a"",
      name: ""Whole Milk"",
      type: ""Dairy"",
      nutrientsPer100ml: {
        fat: 3.6,      // grams
        carbs: 4.8,    // grams (lactose)
        protein: 3.4,  // grams
        fiber: 0,      // grams (milk has no fiber)
      }
    };

Then, I want to define common recipes or meals that I eat regularly.

Let's use a common breakfast example: Coffee with milk, bread with butter, greek yogurt with blueberries:

    // Coffee (Black, Brewed)

      }
    };

All ingredients have their metadata.

Now, we create the `const simpleBreakfast` which will include all these ingredients we defined earlier.

    const simpleBreakfast = {
      id: ""b2k4m6p8q"",
      name: ""Simple Breakfast"",
      type: ""Breakfast"",
      ingredients: [coffee, milk, bread, butter, greekYogurt, blueberries],
      preptime: 10  // minutes
    };

With this setup, I want to start creating meal plans by typing ""`simpleBreakfast`"" and the string name Simple Breakfast is auto-completed, it then generates the list of ingredients needed below. Something along these lines. There are more opportunities here.

This will help me remember meals and recipes, sometimes i have brain fog and i just can't remember all ingredients or possible meals i could have, and auto-completing these would be very useful and productive.

Next, other types of objects that I want to define and use globally across my vault.

* People -> typing @ and shows up a list of people i defined, like most apps
* Equipment/tools/objects -> kitchenware, furniture, plants, electronics, bicycle
* Locations -> places like houses i lived, my parents house, my office, bedroom, terrace etc
* Abstract -> Projects, Documents, travel,
* Food/ingredients/products -> like mentioned before
* Flexibility to expand to other cases in the future

Now, we have to figure an efficient way to call these objects across our vault. do we need backticks? do we start with a symbols like $? #?

The hashtag # conflicts with the tag system. the dollar sign $ might conflict with something else, I don't know. I want to find an established framework, but the end goal is to make my life easier, not more complicated. I want to start typing and I want options to show-up in a drop down list. I don't want complicated formatting styles and having to remember these object's exact names. Fuzzy typing would be good.

The Obsidian vanilla method to do this:

The standard method would be to create a single note for each object, and adding metadata/frontmatter. Then, to call these objects we would type `[[ ]]` and get it as a note. This would be very impractical, as all these objects would get mixed up with unrelated notes. I would also get hundreds of notes, when I could have a single file defining these objects. I also don't want to mix these object properties with the global metadata/frontmatter. I want two clearly distinct systems. This option is unviable.

============================================================

After some reflection I thought of something more refined:

Creating dedicated files for each object category:

* `.objects/people.md`
* `.objects/food.md`
* `.objects/equipment.md`
* `.objects/locations.md`
* `.objects/recipes.md`
* `...`

Each file would contain JavaScript-style object definitions in code blocks.

Calling convention

I thought of using the caret symbol `^` followed by the object name:

* `^dellXPS` \- for equipment
* `^simpleBreakfast` \- for recipes
* `^@alexJoe` \- for people (combining \^ with @)
* `^#kitchen` \- for locations (combining \^ with #)
* Why?
* Not commonly used in Obsidian's native syntax
* Easy to type and visually distinct
* Doesn't conflict with tags (#) or variables ($)
* `^@` \- People (\^@alice, \^@bob)
* `^#` \- Locations (\^#kitchen, \^#office)
* `^$` \- Equipment (\^dellXPS, \^ kitchenAid)
* `^&` \- Recipes/Meals (\^&simpleBreakfast)
* `^%` \- Abstract concepts (\^%projectAlpha)
* There's some flexibility with this system to customize to our needs

Jj is a small dog who is Maltese,  Schitzu, and Yorkie. He loves my husband and I call him my husband's butt buddy. My husband cant go anywhere in our home without Jj by his side. Yes, including the bathroom. If he cant run in before the door shuts he waits patiently by the door.
But this morning when I woke up at 4 am to get ready for my workout and workday, Jj was sleeping next to me. He woke up and followed me around while I used the restroom,  went out to kitchen and got  my coffee and when I laid down on the floor to exercise he demanded pets. 
Ahƒ•, this is what it feels like to have the love of a dog like Jj. 
Dont get me wrong I have my favorite girl but she doesn't love a human like Jj. She is more independent.  
This morning felt a little more special.  It's going to be a great day. I hope you all have a special pet in your life. Pets love in a way no human can equal. ",13,1755083154.0,BenignExistence,0,1.0,False
1mp1dqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1mp1dqn/am_i_overreacting/,Am I overreacting,"Hey guys 

So I (M26) started off in the AM process some time ago and it‚Äôs going really well so far. I‚Äôve been talking to 2 people recently, I have seen them both over coffee a lunch a couple of times and for one, both parents have met each other (the others parents are in Doha and have spoken to both me and my parents over Zoom). Nothings serious yet, but I kinda like the second girl more (parents in Doha) as I feel we have more in common, she has a cooler more interesting job and I find her and her sense of fashion prettier. 

However over the weekend, I met up with her and her friends for lunch bc we happened to be at the same city and some things that happened over lunch has been replaying in my head and idk if it‚Äôs weird or not. 

So basically I gave her my IG a some time ago and thought nothing of it and we follow each other. However when I met her friends who have also been her flatmates through uni, it was clear to me that all 3 of them had extensively gone through my IG. As in following/followers, likes under my post, tagged photos and comments. Obviously going through someone‚Äôs posts and highlights is completely normal but I thought this was a bit weird. What was weirder was THEM bringing up people I follow, and how there were ‚Äúa lot of white girls‚Äù and even picked a few out by name who had commented on my posts or tagged me in posts and one of them mentioned 2 names and said they seem to like all your photos what‚Äôs that about? I laughed it off and said that they‚Äôre my friends from uni and have known them for years and were good friends to which the girl that asked made a face. The girl (prospect) never really made any comments and didn‚Äôt necessarily indulge in this part of the conversation. 

My problem is, I found this quite weird and honestly feel like a slight invasion of my privacy esp coming from them. If it were from the prospect, then fair enough (to some extent) but I also have the feeling that she might‚Äôve set them up to ask me these questions so she wouldn‚Äôt have to. I feel like going through someone‚Äôs following/followers and likes and stuff is childish Highscholl behaviour and I also didn‚Äôt like being cross examined by her friends. It felt kinda weird like imagine if my male friends asked her who‚Äôs this guy that‚Äôs liking all your posts and commenting on some pictures?? I‚Äôd ask them to stfu. 

I‚Äôd say following a lot of models and influencers is def worth bringing up (as I too find that weird and honestly kind of pathetic) but every single one of these girls they mentioned followed me back and were friends. A few had a fairly high follower but I (nor they tbf) would consider them ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù (if you can‚Äôt tell, I hate influencers.) 

My concern is, is this a prequel to how things will be in the future or is this normal in this process. I understand friends will always want to look out for each other but at the same time ick. I haven‚Äôt yet brought this up to her. 

Would love your take on this 

TLDR: am prospects friends filtered through my IG and asked my really personal questions about friends. Is this weird?

**2024-02-10 Saturday (Evening, 4:12 PM)**

**(Annie‚Äôs POV)**  

I stood at the beach for nearly fifteen minutes, listening to the waves crash against the shore. The sun hung low in the sky, casting shades of orange and gold, but my eyes kept drifting toward the walkway.  

**Where is he? Why isn‚Äôt he here yet?**

I looked down at my outfit, a white top and a red skirt. It took me forever to choose it, but I thought it looked cute enough for‚Ä¶ well, whatever this was.  

Then I saw him.  

Armin.  

He walked toward me, and for a moment, I forgot how to breathe. He didn‚Äôt seem like the shy, awkward **‚Äúnerd‚Äù** I remembered from college. His short, neatly cut hair framed his face, making him look both mature and charming. The deep red shirt and black pants suited him perfectly, giving him a subtle but confident style. He wore a smile that was effortlessly cute, yet he carried himself like a man who had truly grown into himself. My heart skipped a beat.  

**‚ÄúHey, Annie,‚Äù** he called, smiling warmly. **‚ÄúSorry for being late. Did I make you wait too long?‚Äù**

His voice brought me back to reality.  
**‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ no‚Ä¶ no, not at all. I‚Ä¶ I just got here too.‚Äù** I felt my cheeks flush. Why was I stuttering like a lovesick teenager?  

He tilted his head slightly, studying me. **‚ÄúYou sure you‚Äôre okay?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù** I said quickly. **‚ÄúI was just‚Ä¶ thinking about something.‚Äù** I tried to downplay it with a casual shrug.  

**‚ÄúAlright then,‚Äù** he said, smiling again. **‚ÄúSo, where should we go?‚Äù**  

I hesitated. **‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶ I honestly can‚Äôt decide. What do you think?‚Äù**  

He thought for a moment, then said, **‚ÄúHow about the mall?‚Äù**  

**‚ÄúYeah, sure. Why not?‚Äù**  

We walked side by side toward the biggest mall in Japan. The breeze felt cool against my skin, but my heart was warm. I found myself stealing glances at him, and each time, my cheeks grew warmer. Then I noticed his cheeks were slightly red too.  

A small smile crept onto my lips.  

**Yeah‚Ä¶ this is my man.**  

As we walked, I couldn‚Äôt help but wish Mikasa would one day find someone who made her feel the way Armin was making me feel right now.


**(Armin‚Äôs POV)**

I felt something new inside me as I walked beside Annie. She looked adorable in her outfit‚Äîa simple white top and a red skirt that fluttered softly with each step. We strolled along a quiet road lined with cherry blossom trees. The delicate pink petals drifted down around us, catching in our hair and on our shoulders, as if nature was celebrating this moment.

The falling petals created a gentle shower that felt almost magical, filling me with warmth I hadn‚Äôt expected. I wanted to hold onto this feeling, something fresh and hopeful that I had never known before.

Trying to steady my voice, I broke the silence. **‚ÄúYou look so cute and gorgeous in this outfit.‚Äù**

Annie‚Äôs cheeks flushed instantly. **‚ÄúOh, thank you, Armin. You look really handsome with your new look and hairstyle. I think you should keep it like this.‚Äù**

I glanced over at her, smiling as her blush deepened until her cheeks turned as red as tomatoes. She was even cuter when she blushed‚Äîthere was something about it that made my heart skip.

We continued down the path, petals swirling in the soft breeze, wrapping us in a quiet, beautiful moment. A particularly graceful blossom landed on my hand. Annie noticed it and gently brushed it away with a shy smile. For a moment, it felt like we were the only two people in the world.

Eventually, we reached the mall. Stepping inside, the cool air and lively atmosphere welcomed us, a sharp contrast to the soft tranquility outside. Annie‚Äôs eyes sparkled with excitement as we prepared to browse and shop, while I got ready to loosen my wallet for the day.


**(Time skip: Night, 6:15 PM)**

**(Annie‚Äôs POV)**

We sat together in a cozy caf√©, sharing a sweet cake and sipping hot coffee. After all the shopping at the mall, I couldn‚Äôt believe Armin had actually bought me that necklace I‚Äôd wanted for so long. I traced its delicate chain with my fingers as I looked into his eyes, blue like sapphires, clear and calm. Somehow, I had never really noticed how striking they were until now.

**‚ÄúHey, Armin. Thank you for everything today,‚Äù** I said softly, locking eyes with him.

He shrugged, a little shy but warm. **‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing, Annie. You don‚Äôt have to thank me.‚Äù**

I hesitated, then asked, **Well why did you pull me out of Eren‚Äôs room yesterday when we were visiting him?‚Äù**

He rubbed the back of his neck, looking a little embarrassed. **‚ÄúAh, well, I just wanted Mikasa to have some time alone with him.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúWhy does she need to talk to him so much?‚Äù** I pressed.

Armin‚Äôs eyes grew serious. **‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve noticed, Mikasa has been different these last few days. She‚Äôs acting kind of distracted.‚Äù**

I nodded and added, **‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs probably because she has a crush on Jean.‚Äù**

He gave a small, knowing smile. ‚ÄúThat too. But honestly, Jean‚Äôs not really a good fit for her.‚Äù

I frowned. **‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúBecause he can be rude, a bit of a bully sometimes, and he doesn‚Äôt really care about others. He‚Äôs one of those popular guys on campus who people don‚Äôt really like,‚Äù** Armin said plainly.

I thought that over. **‚ÄúOkay, but what does that have to do with Eren?‚Äù**

Armin leaned back, his eyes thoughtful. **‚ÄúTo be honest, I think Eren might actually be better for Mikasa. She hates him for reasons I don‚Äôt fully get, but there‚Äôs something good in him‚Äîkindness beneath all that anger. He‚Äôs just lonely. No one looks out for him. At least Mikasa has us, but Eren‚Äôs been on his own.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre trying to play matchmaker?‚Äù** I teased.

He laughed, looking a little embarrassed. **‚ÄúYeah, something like that.‚Äù**

Changing the subject, Armin‚Äôs voice softened. **‚ÄúActually, there‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been meaning to say to you.‚Äù**

I looked at him, curious. **‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúFor a while now, I‚Äôve felt something new that makes me really happy,‚Äù** he confessed, reaching for my hand across the table. His touch was gentle but steady.

Heat rushed to my cheeks before I even realized it. **‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm in love with you, Annie. I believe you might be my soulmate. Will you accept that?‚Äù**

My heart raced. I wanted to say the same for so long but never found the courage. Now, without hesitation, I squeezed his hand. **‚ÄúI accept. I‚Äôve wanted to tell you this for a while too, Armin.‚Äù**

A smile spread across his face, bright and sincere. **‚ÄúSo does this mean we‚Äôre officially dating?‚Äù**

I nodded, unable to hide my grin.

He leaned in closer, his eyes hopeful. I closed mine, waiting for a kiss, but he pulled back shyly, laughing softly. **‚ÄúMaybe next time,‚Äù** he whispered.

Suddenly, he stood up. **‚ÄúAnyway, it‚Äôs getting late. Let me walk you home.‚Äù**

I stood too, feeling a flutter in my stomach. As we stepped outside, the cool night air wrapped around us, and the moon hung bright above, casting a silvery glow over the street.

This time, our hands found each other naturally. I rested my head on his shoulder, and we walked side by side‚Äîquiet, comfortable, like we belonged together.

The gentle breeze and soft moonlight made the world feel like a dream, and for the first time in a long time, I was exactly where I wanted to be.


(Time skip: 10:15 PM)

**(Eren‚Äôs POV)**

I finally got out of the hospital and was on my way back to my apartment. The night sky stretched wide above me, a vast canvas filled with stars. The moon hung big and bright, casting a soft, silver glow over the world. It looked beautiful and calm, as if it was untouched by my troubles.

I reached my apartment building and paused for a moment before unlocking the door. I glanced at Mikasa‚Äôs room across the hall. A heavy sigh escaped me. So close, yet worlds apart.

I stepped inside and closed the door behind me. Home sweet home, or at least that‚Äôs how it was supposed to feel. I washed up, changed, and crawled into bed, but the silence felt heavier than the bruises on my body.

My phone buzzed on the table. It was a message from Armin.

**Armin (7:20 PM):**  
*Hey, Eren! I heard you got discharged. Glad to hear you‚Äôre okay. I have to tell you‚Äîtoday, I took Annie out on a date and proposed to her. And she said yes. I hope you find someone too, man. Someone who can pull you out of this loneliness.*

I stared at the screen for a long moment before typing back.

**Me (10:42 PM):**  
*Hey, that‚Äôs great news. Sorry for the late reply‚ÄîI just got in. And don‚Äôt start acting like some love guru trying to fix me. That kind of thing? It‚Äôs never gonna happen.*

I set the phone down, my fingers lingering on the edge of the table. I looked out the window again, the moon still hanging there, distant and perfect. The world was moving on, full of new beginnings for some, but for me, it felt like I was stuck in a quiet void.

Loneliness wasn‚Äôt just the absence of people. It was feeling invisible in a crowd, like the echo of empty rooms inside my chest. It was watching others laugh, love, and live while I remained in the shadows, unsure if I belonged anywhere.

Yet, as I watched the moonlight spill across the floor, a small, stubborn part of me whispered a fragile hope. Maybe someday, somewhere, I‚Äôd find a light like that too. Not just to see by, but to warm me from the inside.

For now, though, I closed my eyes and let the night wrap around me. Tomorrow would be another day. And maybe, just maybe, that would be enough to keep going.

**Memory Transcription Subject: Thyla. Farsul Foster Child. Soon to be Orphanage Resident.**

**Date: \[Standardized Human time\] February 15, 2137**

I open my eyes to complete darkness. I take a deep breath and smell no one else in the room. Like nearly always, my arms and legs and tail are bound in the blanket roll I have created in my sleep. A slow, stuttering breath escapes my lips and I try to fall back asleep by counting calo nuggets in my head.

*I must have woken up really early today if I woke up on my own. Raymond always wakes me up from sleeping. Or‚Ä¶ maybe he‚Äôs late for work and is still sleeping? O-or maybe he‚Äôs left a-and forgotten me here?* ***No.***

Just then, the sounds of footfalls on hard floors echo down the hall and I quickly squeeze my eyes shut as I hear the door open. I try my best to not open my eyes or move my nose and ears as the footsteps get closer, eventually stopping right beside me. I hold my breath as I wait for the touch but nothing happens. I wait even more but still nothing. I chance a peek with one eye and see Raymond smiling down at me as we make eye contact. I quickly shut my eye again and go back to waiting.

Then, as expected, a warm hand strokes across my head and then to my shoulder as I am gently rocked back and forth in my blanket roll. My tail is only prevented from wagging by its tight wrap to my leg as the hand lifts off of me and I open my eyes as Raymond begins to talk.

‚ÄúGood morning, Thyla. You were up early today; anything bothering you or did you just sleep well?‚Äù

‚ÄúC-could you tell I was awake?‚Äù

‚ÄúEasily, you don‚Äôt normally sleep by squeezing your eyes shut, you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúDarn.‚Äù

He then grabs the edge of the blanket and I giggle as I am slowly unraveled from the blanket and then onto the bed. I close my eyes for another head pat and afterwards he starts to walk out of the room.

‚ÄúDo whatever you need to do and quick; the hovercar will be here soon and we‚Äôll eat on the way there. Don‚Äôt have much time today.‚Äù

*Oh Elders! I* ***do*** *get to go with him today! He‚Äôs going to show me the car he has been making on his workpad.*

‚ÄúOkay, Raymond!‚Äù

I hop out of bed as he exits and I quickly rush through my morning routine, making sure to do everything that Raymond always asks. I get to the final step of grabbing the ear wipes, and just as I am about to open one, I stop short.

*Every time I do it myself, the wipe is too cold. Raymond knows how to heat them up and wipe better. I‚Äôm sure he won‚Äôt mind doing it again.*

Happy with my plan, I take two wipes and a brush as I go out to Raymond, who is sitting at the table dressed in different clothes than normal. His ‚Äòshirt‚Äô is now just a blue button-up thing with long sleeves and a weird fabric necklace hanging down the front and instead of the normal blue pants and brown boots, he has black pants and shiny black boots. As I get close, he turns around to me and quickly stands up out of his chair, grabs his pack and mask, and waves me to the door with his hand.

I grab my own pad off of the charger and my own pack with wipes and brush inside is placed over my back as we exit his apartment. Like we‚Äôve done before, the hovercar is waiting outside the lobby with a small crowd taking a close look and again giving us weird, mean Venlil looks as Raymond opens the doors and I quickly get in. I sit close to Raymond and both of us take our packs and begin to unload some items while he also removes his mask.

Just as the car is streaking up into the sky, Raymond hands me two small chocolate and grain bars while I put my brush and the ear wipes on his lap. He smiles and turns his eyes down at me.

‚ÄúNow when I said for you to do whatever you needed to do, I did also mean to clean your ears and untangle your fur.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ it just gets done better when you do it.‚Äù

His smile slowly fades and he nearly seems sad as he looks down at the brush and wipes on his lap. He picks them up and rolls them in his hands without saying anything. He then squeezes the wipes in his hands for a moment before opening one and pointing up for me to raise my ears.

‚ÄúI-I‚Äôm glad you do enjoy me doing this, Thyla, but you should learn to do it on your own for when‚Ä¶ You know, I won‚Äôt always be around.‚Äù

*~~No matter what I do, I‚Äôm going to that Sivkit orphanage soon. He wants me gone.~~*

‚ÄúI understand‚Ä¶‚Äù

Despite the shift in mood, I do my best to enjoy the feeling of the warm wipes against my inner ears. I can‚Äôt help but lean heavily into his hands and he‚Äôs done cleaning much too quickly. I take one of the grain bars and begin to munch away at it while Raymond begins using the brush to effortlessly untangle the few knots in my fur on my arm and on my back.

I have to get up and shift around for him to hit all of the places that he can get easily but by the time he‚Äôs done, I am already done eating and can do the rest myself. I retake my brush and start on my legs while Raymond eats his own grain bars.

Raymond‚Äôs work must be really close to the apartment because I barely finish brushing as the car is already coming in to land somewhere on the ground. I look out of the window and see that we are in some dense forest with a few weird squiggly roads and a few buildings all surrounded by a really big fence. The hovercar comes in close to the ground and begins to act like a normal car as it glides up to a small hut with gates blocking the road forward. The car suddenly stops and a really big Venlil man comes out of the hunt and starts walking up to my side of the car.

Raymond stands and moves to the other side of me as he rolls the window down when the Venlil come near. The man looks suspiciously in for a moment before his eyes brighten and his ears barely wag.

‚ÄúOh! Mr. Oakley, it‚Äôs been a while! Welcome back!‚Äù

‚ÄúHah, it has been a while. Nice to see you again, Tarmaq!‚Äù

Tarmaq looks further into the car and somehow sees me hiding behind Raymond as he becomes much more serious again.

‚ÄúUh, Mr. Oakley, who do you have accompanying you?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, this is Thyla. I‚Äôve temporarily been assigned to be her foster parent, hence my lack of attendance here lately.‚Äù

Tarmaq relaxes just a bit as he steps away and activates something that raises the gate to the road and into this place.

‚ÄúWell, I guess there‚Äôs nothing that‚Äôd stop you from doing the test. You two have fun, and have a good paw.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you, you too, Tarmaq!‚Äù

Raymond rolls the window up and the car begins to glide slowly forward down the winding road. Instead of going back to his original seat, Raymond just pushes me across the seats. I audibly huff at this, causing him to giggle at me.

‚ÄúRaymond, why did that Venlil man have to see who was inside here?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, apparently this facility has had a problem with Nevok and Fissan corporate spies coming in to steal and leak designs of the cars before they‚Äôre public. I‚Äôd think that stealing and cheating are not very herd-like under normal Federation culture but I must be wrong.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because Nevoks and Fissans are bad herd members. They like money too much and it makes them mean.‚Äù

‚ÄúI-I don‚Äôt know if that applies to all Nevoks and Fissans, does it? I‚Äôm sure the majority are nice people.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmmm, some of them are‚Ä¶‚Äù

Raymond only slowly nods as I teach him about the greedy Nevoks but soon the car has pulled up to a really big glass building surrounded by a bunch of strange-looking cars, both normal and hover. Raymond puts on his mask and opens the door and helps me out as we head towards the entrance of what looks to be an office building. The doors slide open and I bounce my pack on my back as I hop around in awe at the interior design. Even the Arxur-proof sliders are neatly decorated and inlaid into the walls.¬†

A group of Venlil turn to look at Raymond and me as we head towards another door in the back of the lobby. They all stop their conversations and stare like predators as Raymond gives a wave to the group. Suddenly one Venlil lady steps out and gestures towards me.

*Elders above, i-it‚Äôs going to be like all other Venlil, isn‚Äôt it?*

‚ÄúOh my stars, Raymond, who is this little cutie pup you have with you?‚Äù

I feel my face flush deep blue as Raymond stops trying to open this next door and turns towards the group of slowly approaching Venlil.

*N-no, Raymond, please, let‚Äôs just go inside.*

‚ÄúOh, this is Thyla. She was rescued from Talsk and she‚Äôs been with me as an emergency foster. I don‚Äôt really have any babysitting options so she gets to come and watch the test today. Thyla, say hello.‚Äù

My embarrassed blue turns into a blue of panic but I manage to squeak to the lady.

‚ÄúHello, Miss.‚Äù

‚ÄúHi Thyla, I love your backpack.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you, Miss.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so polite. Well, I hope you enjoy getting to watch the test later!‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you, Miss.‚Äù

Raymond gives the group a wave goodbye and finally manages to open the door into a long hallway filled with doors and glass walls. I follow behind him as we pass rooms with long tables and lots of chairs and also rooms with only one big desk and a chair behind it. Raymond stops at a room with all of the shades drawn and unlocks it with his pad.

The frosted glass door swings open and I find that the room is another one that has a really big desk by itself but with a view out towards the squiggly roads. Aside from the desk, there‚Äôs also a small couch and a table with chairs set up like a living room towards a projection wall. Raymond closes the door behind me and locks it as he takes off his mask and sets it on the desk.

‚ÄúRaymond, where are we?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is my office here at the test site.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the other door go to?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs this office‚Äôs bathroom and shower.‚Äù

*It‚Äôs all hidden and put away far from the other places. No one gets to see in here and Raymond doesn‚Äôt get to see out.*

‚ÄúHey Raymond?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey gave you this office and blocked the windows and bathroom because you are a human, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt say it like that, but yeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúTypical Venlil‚Ä¶‚Äù

Raymond doesn‚Äôt respond as he huffs and heads over to a small machine in the corner with tea mugs beside it. He places one on the machine‚Äôs tray and as it starts, I instantly recognize it as another coffee maker. The bitter, smokey-smelling drink pours into the mug, and almost before it‚Äôs done Raymond grabs it and heads over to his desk. As he sits down, he looks back over to me, and worry flashes across his eyes.

‚ÄúThyla? You can sit down over on the couch or chairs if you‚Äôd like.‚Äù

*I guess I am still standing here, aren‚Äôt I?*

I walk over to the couch and sit down on a tail-friendly cushion for the first time in a while. I take my pack off and retrieve my pad from inside. I quickly scroll to the pup-approved Bleat app and start to look again at all of the local Mirror Lake City posts. Before I even get a few posts in, Raymond huffs at me from his desk, which is now lit up by a projection from his work pad.

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt there something else you‚Äôre supposed to be doing, Thyla?‚Äù

*W-what else‚Äîoh yeah. The pre-school homework for Star Lake Primary School.*

‚ÄúM-my homework.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right, don‚Äôt want to be behind when you get there and start school again.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Raymond.‚Äù

\------

*Venlil schoolwork is really weird. I guess that makes sense, though, but it‚Äôs really hard to understand history and social studies when every other sentence seems to be missing.*

As I‚Äôve been doing schoolwork and playing catch-up for my upcoming move, Raymond has been frantically doing his own work on his pad. Every so often, he mutters harshly under his breath, and it‚Äôs just quiet enough that I can‚Äôt hear it even when raising my ears. Just as I am finishing another reading section, Raymond‚Äôs pad begins to ring from a call. He frantically answers it to the side of his head.

‚ÄúHello, this is Raymond. Is the test ready? Awesome, we‚Äôll be over there shortly. Yes, we do. I have a guest today. Perfect, be there soon.‚Äù

Raymond quickly packs his pad in his pants and motions for me to stand up. I comply and put my pad away in my pack as he puts his mask back on. I follow behind him as he turns off the lights and exits his office and starts speed-walking down the hallway. I have to nearly trot to keep up as he goes out of the building a different way and hops into a small cart with no doors. We whir away from the office building and down the winding roads to a set of smaller garages with balconies on top.

‚ÄúRaymond, where are we going? What is this test you and everyone keep talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúHave I not explained it to you? Sorry, kiddo. Uh, today, you know how this is a car company? Well, I‚Äôve been helping them design a new type of car, and today I‚Äôm being allowed to be the first person to ever drive it. I‚Äôm going to test it out on the proving grounds here.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat type of car is it? I don‚Äôt think people can drive hovercars.‚Äù

‚ÄúHah, it‚Äôs not a hovercar. It‚Äôs a sports car.‚Äù

‚ÄúSports car? What type of sport can you play with a car?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no, it‚Äôs not really for playing a sport, although you can race with it. It‚Äôs just a type of car meant only for driving very fast and around tight corners with a lot of power.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat sounds really dangerous.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù

As Raymond drives the cart around the garages, I see a really big crowd of Venlil, and my stomach drops even further. He parks the cart next to other identical ones and walks over to a Venlil wearing a very fancy vest. The Venlil lady sticks her paw out, and Raymond readily grabs it and shakes it up and down as I slowly approach from behind him. When I get to Raymond‚Äôs side, I try to shrink as I catch the attention of the lady.

‚ÄúOh, Raymond, who do we have here?‚Äù

‚ÄúMrs. Phyul, this is Thyla. I believe that I mentioned before that I was acting as an emergency foster parent. Thyla, this is Mrs. Phyul, 3rd-generation owner of Rocktumbler Atmospheric AutoCrafts.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yes, I remember now! Well, very nice to meet you, Thyla. I hope you have a wonderful time joining us to watch the test.‚Äù

‚ÄúT-thank you, Mrs. Phyul.‚Äù

Raymond and Mrs. Phyul continue speaking, but my brain starts to go fuzzy as I notice more and more Venlil approaching. I press into Raymond‚Äôs leg, and he idly puts a hand on my head, which I readily close my eyes and lean in to. Suddenly, his hand pulls away, and my ears snap back to reality.

‚ÄúLooks like it‚Äôs time. Thyla, please follow Mrs. Phyul, and both of you enjoy the demonstration!‚Äù

*H-he‚Äôs really going to leave me here with only Venlil. I-it‚Äôs okay; he thinks it‚Äôll be okay.*

‚ÄúG-good luck, Raymond.‚Äù

As Raymond takes off into the garages, I follow behind Mrs. Phyul, who suddenly stops and pokes her tail out behind her while looking back at me. I freeze in place as her gaze becomes more and more intense, but she luckily starts to talk to me.

‚ÄúThyla, grab my tail, and I‚Äôll lead you through everyone. You can sit right next to me during the test.‚Äù

*Oh, tail following.* ***She*** *told us about that one time, but Venlil tails aren‚Äôt as sensitive as Farsul‚Äôs.*

‚ÄúT-thank you, Mrs. Phyul.‚Äù

I reach out and lightly grab the end of her tail as she parts a path through the crowd of Venlil, who readily give way to her. We reach the end of the garages and go up a staircase to a long, open room with floor-to-ceiling windows down the entire length. A bunch of projection walls are placed along where the windows meet the ceiling, and most are filled with diagrams and numbers that I don‚Äôt understand, but others have cameras along a bunch of empty roads. Mrs. Phyul takes me to the middle of the long room, where a set of big, fluffy chairs are set behind a small table covered in drinks and snacks.

Mrs. Phyul takes the middle chair and I nervously sit next to her as she pulls her pad out of her vest and begins to rapidly type something. I remain as quiet as possible while staring out across the empty road, wondering when Raymond is going to start driving. A while passes with more Venlil coming into the room all around us, and then Mrs. Phyul suddenly taps me on my shoulder with her tail.

‚ÄúThyla, dear, feel free to have as much of the drinks and snacks as you want. Well, of course, you can‚Äôt have the alcohol at your age.‚Äù

*My stomach falls into a bottomless pit as the terrifying drink is mentioned. My eyes scan the table more intensely, but I can‚Äôt pick out which ones are supposed to have the danger inside.*

‚ÄúM-Mrs. Phyul, wh-which cans a-are safe?‚Äù

‚ÄúSafe? Oh, non-alcoholic? That purple one is a sweet melon drink from Rentag. You‚Äôll love it.‚Äù

I try my best to grab the purple can without touching the unknown ones. I bring the can closer to me and crack it open with a loud pop and take a sip.

*It‚Äôs kinda slimy, but I guess it‚Äôs not too bad for Letian food.*

I also reach out to grab various fruit slices and crunchy strayu bits as the noise in the room reaches its pinnacle. A massive boom roars from underneath us, and everyone in the room goes completely silent with their ears pointed towards the floor. The roar fades to a light, floor-shaking rumble as, from directly below Mrs. Phyul and me, a long red car creeps out and towards the empty roads.

Just barely through the window, I can see what looks like Raymond in a really big helmet and full-body suit in the driver‚Äôs seat. The car continues to slowly roll away until it reaches the edge of the road. All of a sudden, the car‚Äôs engine begins to roar again, and the tires screech in white smoke as the vehicle disappears down the road. The Venlil in the room remain silent as I follow their attention up to the projections above me. The numbers still don‚Äôt make sense, but the cameras follow the car as Raymond drives way too fast around corners and over hills.

*I can‚Äôt look. I can‚Äôt look. I can‚Äôt look. I can‚Äôt look. I can‚Äôt lo-*

‚ÄúThyla, are you alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúI-it‚Äôs just really scary to see Raymond in danger.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, flowerbird, he‚Äôs not in much danger. He‚Äôs a very good driver, but you‚Äôre sweet for caring about him. I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôve liked living with him?‚Äù

‚ÄúY-yeah, I like Raymond. He listens to me, and lets me watch shows, and takes me on walks. B-but I have to go to the orphanage soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúOrphanage? Oh, I guess he is just emergency foster care. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be fine there, dear.‚Äù

‚ÄúT-that‚Äôs what Raymond said.‚Äù

*It‚Äôs not right. I know it‚Äôs not right, but no one listens.*

\------

Long after Raymond had finished driving the scary car and coming back to talk with a bunch of smart-sounding Venlil, he and I now sit at the table back at his apartment and are eating dinner. My stomach feels like it‚Äôs overly full despite not having much to eat the entire day so while Raymond sips his vegetable soup while reading his pad in one hand, I just spin the pieces around in my bowl.

Just as I am about to be done and put my bowl away for tomorrow, Raymond‚Äôs pad starts to ring with a call. He nearly spits his soup out as he quickly sets the bowl down and brings the pad in front of him and puts an earbud in.

*I know he doesn't want me to listen to his calls, but it‚Äôs hard not to because he and the people he talks to are always so loud.*

‚ÄúHello?!‚Äù

‚ÄúHowdy, RayRay, did ya miss me?‚Äù

*A new female human voice? It doesn‚Äôt sound like his coworkers.*

‚ÄúM-more than you can even imagine, Zoe.‚Äù

*Zoe‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs Raymond‚Äôs mate‚Äôs name!*

‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôve I missed?‚Äù

‚ÄúI-uhhh, have you not read my texts?‚Äù

‚ÄúNope, commander is bein‚Äô a real hardass about external communications and I counted down to the exact second of when we‚Äôd be connected back, and I called you right now at that instant.‚Äù

Raymond‚Äôs face somehow drains of color as his voice carries a slight tremble.

‚ÄúI-I think you should read them‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúSure? Dude, you sound so nervous. Let‚Äôs see ‚Äòere... Permits for the restaurant and bar went through, received the printers, annoying folk at work‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just not seeing what you‚Äôre so nervous ab‚Äîoh hell, you saved a starving Farsul kid off of the street?! What the fuck? The Venlil wouldn‚Äôt see her because of the Archives?! Okay, that‚Äôs pretty rough; sorry you had to deal with that, babe.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou should ***really*** keep readin‚Äô.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh Lord, there‚Äôs more? Okay, Seward asked you to‚Ä¶. Hey, *Raymond*, is there any chance you‚Äôre sittin‚Äô next to a small Farsul girl named Thyla at our apartment right now?‚Äù

‚ÄúYep, keep readin‚Äô.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou messed up her medication, you got her a haircut, and you both nearly got jumped by murdervens. Okay, VP is worse than I ‚Äòmember. And now you‚Äôre takin‚Äô her to Star Lake to‚Ä¶ Ramyond, do you mind goin‚Äô on speakerphone and handin‚Äô the pad to Thyla?‚Äù

‚ÄúO-of course.‚Äù

Raymond then clicks a button on his pad and starts to hand it towards me. I now hear a bunch of buzzing and beeping coming from the pad as I grab it and set it on the table in front of me. On the screen is a human lady with reddish-yellow hair and bright, blood-blue eyes. Her cheeks have little dots across them as her face looks worried and scared, like Raymond‚Äôs sometimes does. Her hand flies up and covers her mouth as she gasps, and my ears and tail quickly fall flat in fear.

‚Äú***O. M. G.*** Thyla, you are the single cutest puppy-girl I have ever seen. It‚Äôs actually makin‚Äô my heart flutter; I just want to hug you forever and ever.‚Äù

My heart, which I hadn‚Äôt even realized had stopped, begins to beat again as I feel my snout flush blue. My tail begins to wag, and I lean into the camera as Zoe continues.

‚ÄúHow are you feelin‚Äô, honey? You look like you‚Äôre doin‚Äô way better than how Ray described when he found you. Have the doctors at the UN base been good to you? How do you like livin‚Äô with Ray? Oh, sorry for givin‚Äô you so many questions, but I‚Äôm beyond excited to hear you talk.‚Äù

‚ÄúI-I feel a lot better now‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúEeeee! You have the cutest voice! Ope, sorry, continue.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoctor Sweard at the human base was a lot nicer than the doctors on Talsk. He even told me I have a weird stomach and that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt get sick from drinking milk. I really like living with Ray. He gives me a lot of food and lets me watch shows. He also takes me on walks to the park and helps me brush and he let‚Äôs me sleep in a really big bed and‚Ä¶ I-I really like it here, but I‚Äôm going to that Sivkit orphanage in a few days. The owners seemed really nice.‚Äù

I barely manage to stop my eyes from watering as Zoe‚Äôs excitement quickly fades and she leans in close to the camera, making her face take up the entire pad.

‚ÄúThyla, I‚Äôm so glad to hear that you‚Äôre feelin‚Äô so much better. We‚Äôre goin‚Äô to talk again in just a bit, but for now, can you please hand the pad back to Raymond? When you do, please go back to the bedroom and wait in there until Raymond comes back. Don‚Äôt worry about dishes or nothin‚Äô; he‚Äôll take care of that.‚Äù

I flick my ears and nod like a human as I hand the pad back to Raymond. He taps the button on the pad to go back to his earbud, and I quickly stand up and rush back to the bedroom. I climb into the bed and sink my face into my pillow. Tears begin to flow from my eyes, but I cut them off nearly as fast as they started.

*It‚Äôs not good to get a pillow wet. They don‚Äôt dry easily, and it makes them gross.*

I can‚Äôt tell how much time passes, but I soon hear the door slide open, and I pull my face out of the pillow to see Raymond slowly shuffling over to my side with a very blank look on his face. He turns the pad in his hands around, and I see Zoe again on the screen looking at me with a smile. Raymond puts the pad in my lap and turns it back to speaker mode.

‚ÄúHello again, Thyla! Raymond and I just had an important adult talk, but I think you should know at least this one thing: whatever happens, wherever you go, it‚Äôll be because it‚Äôs what‚Äôs best for you. We want nothin‚Äô more than to make sure you are happy and healthy on Venlil Prime, okay?‚Äù

*She sounds just like everyone else! It‚Äôs like they all stole the words from the same show.*

‚ÄúOkay, Zoe.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs scary and frustratin‚Äô, Thyla, but just trust us on this. For now, sleep tight and keep being so smart at school.‚Äù

‚ÄúGoodnight, Zoe.‚Äù

Raymond then takes the pad from me, and with one hand, he pulls the covers up and over me. The room soon goes dark as he exits and goes back to talking with his mate in the living room.

*I wonder what she said to him. Maybe she wants me gone like everyone else? Or maybe she‚Äôs different? I wish she were here to give me that hug forever‚Ä¶*

I tried many doctors and dermatologist and the most they could do is a pus culture test, give an antibiotic but after 2 weeks it relapse.

Upon speaking with Ai it gave many advises and it helped me delay the relapse to 4-5 weeks such as taking certain supplements like Nac, saw palmetto,rhodliea,

We dated for years, start or 2020- end of 2022 lived together, had pets, shared finances and‚Ä¶shared loans. 

Weeks leading up to our split she was hot and cold, wouldn‚Äôt communicate plans (we worked different shifts) and turned off her location (something I‚Äôd previously been able to see but trusted her enough I didn‚Äôt feel the need to check it.) Turns out she was cheating while I was working overtime to give us more savings. She moved out of the house we were renting leaving me to deal with the broken rental agreement, took the car I was paying for every month and moved across state. And left me without transportation to my job so I had to quit it. 

I was quite blindsided by the split as was the rest of her family. Her dad and I got drunk together the day after we separated and I told him I already had her ring (yes I showed him it) he told me he‚Äôd always consider me a son to him.

Initially I turned to drinking then voluntarily went to rehab, started a gym membership, therapy and daily journalism to try to keep myself from internalizing everything.‚Ä¶..2 months after this (or 5 months post separation) I pawned the engagement ring I was 3 weeks from kneeling with when we split. I moved back in with my parents (which felt like a massive step backwards at the time but I‚Äôve now come to terms with it being a redirection) and started a project car using the ring money. 

We went no contact until she reached out around 8 months post separation to ‚Äúapologize, and see how I was doing‚Äù I was honest and said I was starting to get better had gotten sober but was still in incredibly rough shape. 

9 months post separation I received a letter from a lawyer wanting to sue me because she hadn‚Äôt been paying the car loan for 90 days and I hadn‚Äôt received any mail saying the car wasn‚Äôt being paid so I reached out to her to ask why. She basically said she couldn‚Äôt afford the car, that they sent mail in my name to her address even though I‚Äôd done a change of address the day I moved out of our house, and that she was going to voluntarily surrender the car to the bank. So we agreed to meet in the bank and I would take over ownership since I needed a car anyways and a voluntary repossession would‚Äôve hit my credit. 

That leads us to now. Therapy has helped me tremendously, I‚Äôm in a better headspace, I have a great job, a few friends, and still have my project car. Her dad and I still talk weekly as we are good friends and respect each other (mostly checking in to see how each other is, telling each other the stories of the day, and talking cars but I never ask about the ex) he‚Äôs invited me to his home to have coffee with him, I‚Äôve camped with him, worked on cars with him etc. 

The car I had to take ownership over has seen much better days. We initially bought it when it had 73k miles and in a year it had 166k (maybe 8k of those miles put on by me) she went to a LOT of parties after we split‚Ä¶because we are co-signed I again reached out (today) to let her know I was about to get a new vehicle (truck) and would be selling the car because of its age, and it reminds me of her so I wanted the email and password for the banks mobile app to verify I had myself in the right position to do so. She responded by saying I needed to cut off all contact with her, that she had a new boyfriend and didn‚Äôt care about the car or credit. 

So WIBTAH if I sued for breach of contract and having to pay the car off to protect my credit while she was still driving it?

	‚Ä¢	Suggestions for US cities or towns that are affordable, safe, and have a good environment for studying

# Best Lids for Ceramic Coffee Mugs in 2025: Top Picks

The quest for the perfect coffee experience often leads to the frustrating realization that many ceramic coffee mugs lack a crucial component: a well-designed lid. A good lid can keep your beverage hot for longer, prevent spills, and even enhance the overall drinking experience. This article explores the best lids available for ceramic coffee mugs in 2025, focusing on features, benefits, and user suitability.

[[Browse top-rated lids for ceramic coffee mugs on Amazon]](https://best.trendsupplier.com/clearance-inventory/?KW=lids+for+ceramic+coffee+mugs)
## Key Features Analysis

The ideal lid for a ceramic coffee mug should possess a combination of practical features that enhance usability and preserve beverage quality.

**Material Composition**

The material used in a coffee mug lid significantly impacts its durability, heat resistance, and safety. Silicone is a popular choice due to its flexibility, heat resistance (up to high temperatures), and food-grade properties. High-quality silicone lids are BPA-free and won't leach harmful chemicals into your drink. Another option is bamboo, which provides a natural and aesthetically pleasing look, though it may require more careful maintenance to prevent warping or cracking. Plastic lids are also available, but it‚Äôs crucial to ensure they are made from BPA-free and heat-resistant materials.

**Sealing Mechanism**

A secure sealing mechanism is essential for preventing spills and retaining heat. Lids with a tight, airtight seal are preferable, as they minimize heat loss and prevent accidental leaks, especially when transporting the mug. Some lids utilize a simple press-fit design, while others incorporate rubber gaskets or O-rings to create a more secure and leak-proof seal. The effectiveness of the sealing mechanism directly influences the lid's ability to maintain beverage temperature and prevent messes.

**Ventilation and Airflow**

While a tight seal is important, a small ventilation hole or adjustable airflow system can enhance the drinking experience. These vents allow for smoother sipping by preventing a vacuum from forming inside the mug. Some lids feature adjustable vents that can be opened or closed to regulate airflow and temperature retention. The design of the ventilation system should minimize spillage while maximizing comfort and ease of use.

**Compatibility and Fit**

The compatibility of a lid with various ceramic mug sizes and shapes is crucial. Universal lids designed to fit a range of diameters are convenient, but may not provide the same secure fit as lids specifically designed for certain mug types. Measuring the inner diameter of your mug is essential to ensure a proper fit. Some manufacturers offer lids with adjustable rims or flexible designs to accommodate slight variations in mug dimensions.

**Ease of Cleaning**

A lid's design should facilitate easy cleaning to prevent the buildup of bacteria and residue. Lids with simple designs and minimal crevices are easier to clean thoroughly. Dishwasher-safe lids are particularly convenient, as they can be sanitized effectively without manual scrubbing. Materials like silicone and stainless steel are less prone to staining and odor absorption compared to plastic.

## Core Benefits

Investing in a quality lid for your ceramic coffee mug offers several practical benefits that enhance your daily coffee routine.

**Temperature Retention**

A well-designed lid significantly improves temperature retention, keeping your coffee hot for longer periods. This is especially beneficial during commutes, outdoor activities, or extended meetings. Lids with insulated designs or tight seals minimize heat loss, allowing you to savor your coffee at the optimal temperature for an extended time.

**Spill Prevention**

A secure lid prevents accidental spills, protecting your clothes, furniture, and belongings from coffee stains. This is particularly important for those who enjoy drinking coffee on the go or in environments where spills are likely to occur. Lids with tight seals and spill-resistant designs provide peace of mind and reduce the risk of messy accidents.

**Enhanced Portability**

A lid transforms your ceramic coffee mug into a portable beverage container, allowing you to take your coffee with you wherever you go. This is especially convenient for commuters, travelers, and anyone who enjoys drinking coffee outside of the home or office. Lids with secure seals and durable construction ensure that your coffee remains safely contained during transport.

**Improved Hygiene**

A lid protects your coffee from airborne contaminants and debris, promoting better hygiene. This is especially important in environments where dust, pollen, or other particles are present. By covering your coffee, a lid helps to maintain its cleanliness and prevent the ingestion of unwanted substances.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about lids for ceramic coffee mugs:

**What materials are best for coffee mug lids?**
Silicone, bamboo, and BPA-free plastic are popular choices. Silicone offers excellent heat resistance and flexibility, while bamboo provides a natural aesthetic. BPA-free plastic is a cost-effective option, but it's crucial to ensure its heat resistance.

**How do I determine the correct size lid for my mug?**
Measure the inner diameter of your mug's opening. Many lids are designed to fit a range of sizes, but a precise measurement ensures a secure and leak-proof fit.

**Are all coffee mug lids dishwasher safe?**
Not all lids are dishwasher safe. Check the manufacturer's instructions to determine whether a lid is suitable for dishwasher cleaning. Silicone and stainless steel lids are generally dishwasher safe, while bamboo lids may require hand washing.

**Do coffee mug lids affect the taste of the coffee?**
Some materials, such as low-quality plastic, can impart a slight taste to the coffee. High-quality silicone, bamboo, and stainless steel are typically inert and won't affect the flavor of your beverage.

How to build identity-based behaviors and habits?","I have built routines and systems to make good habits easier and bad habits harder.
They work well when my environment is under control but that is not always the case.

For example, there is a coffee shop right next to my workplace. When I go to work, then I tell myself ‚Äúskip it,‚Äù but when I walk past, I usually end up buying a coffee. I have even tried the identity approach ‚Äî telling myself ‚ÄúI am the kind of person who only drinks one coffee a day‚Äù ‚Äî but it still does not work in the moment.

Part of the problem is that any identity has a thousand possible behaviours depending on the situation. I cannot be constantly recalling a specific line for every trigger, like ‚Äúif I go past the coffee shop, I should say no.‚Äù

So,  even after building the systems, the root of doing the right action and avoiding wrong action is the mindset. Like, building a mindset of saying no again and again, and yes to all the uncomfortable actions which takes closer to goals.

So am I correct to say that once your systems are in place, the bigger factor in discipline is mindset? And if identity is supposed to be the root of everything, how do you actually build an identity that reliably guides behaviour across all situations?",1,1755082113.0,productivity,1,1.0,False

Had a decent NEET score and first-year results, so my flashcards started getting passed around among batchmates, which led to me  building a website for it.

Here's where I need your help. We're planning to expand to MDS and AYUSH next, because there's literally nothing good out there for those exams. The big players ignore these markets. I'm not asking for 5-star reviews. Just let me know your views on what else it needs work, as per you. Suggestions from redditors who have actually used it matter way more than the startup critiques.

Spent a year building it. Nobody wanted to use a website. Everyone wanted it on their phones, accessible anywhere.

Fast-forward to today, it has almost been a year since we launched our AI-powered platform with thousands of flashcards, qbanks with PYQs, short notes for each chapter, and we're expanding to videos. Started with just NEET PG, but now we cover USMLE, AMC, NEET UG, and FMGE too.

We have made most of the content accessible for free, while the monthly premium sub costing less than what most people spend on coffee.

Let Me Illustrate [Godrej Greenfront Hinjewadi Pune](https://www.godrejgreenfronthinjewadi.com/) for You.

Okay, picture this. You are exhausted from the whole hustle and bustle of life ‚Äî the incessant honking, tight apartments, lack of green spaces, and just the overall feeling that you need to get out. Now imagine a place that is surrounded by trees, that has a real sense of space, and yet is minutes from your office. Sound improbable? That is exactly what I thought of when I heard about Greenfront Hinjewadi.

It‚Äôs not just another apartment building. It‚Äôs part of this massive integrated township called Godrej Park World in Hinjewadi Phase 1. If you‚Äôre not familiar with the area, Hinjewadi is basically Pune‚Äôs Silicon Valley. All the big IT names‚ÄîInfosys, Wipro, TCS‚Äîthey‚Äôre right here. So, if you work in tech, you can probably ditch those nightmare commute hours for good.

[Godrej GreenFront Honjewadi Pune](https://preview.redd.it/mzd208f9mrif1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e94a2b4580ed16af01cdd4716946984fdc3b1c51)

**Why I Think It‚Äôs Worth Looking At**

First, let‚Äôs talk about what makes this place different. Godrej Properties didn‚Äôt just slap together some towers and call it a day. The entire space feels planned around two things‚Äîgreenery and lifestyle.

You know how most buildings have a token lawn that‚Äôs more decorative than usable? Here, we‚Äôre talking acres of landscaped greens, jogging tracks, cycling paths, and proper sit-out zones. It‚Äôs the kind of place where you could go for a walk at 6 am and actually hear birds instead of traffic.

And the homes? Well, they come in different configurations‚Äî2 BHK, 3 BHK, all smartly laid out so you‚Äôre not dealing with wasted corners or awkward spaces. Plus, ventilation is a big focus. Trust me, having sunlight streaming into your living room every morning changes your mood completely.



**Stuff You‚Äôd Actually Use**

I‚Äôve seen a lot of housing projects promise ‚Äúluxury amenities‚Äù that are basically just a dusty gym and a pool you‚Äôll never use. Here, it‚Äôs different because they‚Äôve included stuff that works for actual day-to-day life.

Here‚Äôs what I mean:

* A proper clubhouse with indoor games, lounges, and co-working spaces.
* Swimming pools, including an infinity pool and one for kids.
* Sports courts for tennis, badminton, and even squash.
* Jogging and cycling tracks go through beautifully landscaped gardens.
* Cafes and small stores within the township, so you don't have to run out for every little thing.
* Wellness spaces - yoga decks, meditation zones and more.
* And yes, all the basics, like 24/7 security, CCTV and gated access.



**Location = Huge Win**

If you know Hinjewadi, you already get why location is such a big deal. Being in Phase 1 means you‚Äôre close to the main IT parks and have quick access to the Mumbai‚ÄìPune Expressway. Add to that the upcoming metro line, and commuting anywhere in the city will get even easier.

Schools, hospitals, and malls are also close by‚ÄîBlue Ridge Public School, Symbiosis, Ruby Hall Clinic, Xion Mall‚Äîso you‚Äôre not driving across the city for basic needs.



**The Green Factor**

One thing I really like about Godrej Greenfront Hinjewadi Pune is that they‚Äôve taken the eco-friendly angle seriously. Rainwater harvesting, solar panels for common areas, waste management systems‚Äîit‚Äôs not just for the brochure. Plus, with all that greenery, it‚Äôs naturally cooler, which means you might end up using your AC less.



**For the Investors Out There**

If you‚Äôre more about ROI than moving in yourself, here‚Äôs why this still makes sense:

* Hinjewadi is one of Pune‚Äôs fastest-growing real estate markets.
* Township projects like this generally hold better resale value.
* Metro connectivity and infrastructure development will push prices up further.

Basically, whether you‚Äôre living here or renting it out, you‚Äôre looking at steady returns.



**Why It Feels More Like a Community Than a Building**

This is something that is often lost on people when it comes time to purchase a house. You may have a wonderful apartment, but if the community isn‚Äôt working for you, you‚Äôre not going to feel like you‚Äôre at home. If you buy in Godrej Park World, you can rest assured that there will always be something happening with others in your community: community events, sporting tournaments, or just hanging out at the park. It is one of those instances when kids make friends easily, and you might find yourself meeting for coffee with your neighbors without it feeling contrived.



**Quick Recap if You‚Äôre Skimming**

* Prime spot in Hinjewadi Phase 1.
* 2 & 3 BHK smartly designed homes.
* Loads of greenery and open space.
* Real, usable amenities (not just for show).
* Walking distance to IT parks and close to schools/hospitals.
* Eco-friendly design and sustainable features.
* Strong investment potential.



**So, this is for whom?**¬†

* Tech city professionals want to live closer to work to reduce commute stress.
* Families seeking a family-oriented, safe, green and connected community.
* Investors seeking rental income and good appreciation.
* People just tired of living in small, concrete settings want to have a healthy, quality, fresh-air living experience.



Honestly, buying a home is never really all about floor plans or off-paper location. It's about the life you see yourself living there every day. With Godrej Greenfront Hinjewadi Pune, for me, this feels like it happens all in one place when you finish your work day, get to walk home, go for an evening swim, grab a coffee in the caf√© downstairs and watch your kids in a safe space. It's simple‚Äîbut that's why it works.

If you're in Pune or are thinking about moving, you should see it, not just online, but in reality. Sometimes you walk into a place and just know it can be a home to you and your family. This is one of those times.

Sure, Big Ben and the London Eye are great, but the real charm? It‚Äôs tucked away in quiet gardens, cobbled lanes, and places you might miss if you blink too fast.

One crisp morning, I found myself climbing the steps to **The Hill Garden and Pergola in Hampstead**. It felt like stepping into a forgotten fairytale ‚Äî stone walkways wrapped in wisteria, overlooking manicured lawns. Hard to believe this peaceful spot existed just minutes away from the chatter of Hampstead Heath. Wander a bit more, and Fenton House reveals itself, hiding behind brick walls with orchards so pretty they could be from an old English painting. From its rooftop terrace, the rooftops of Hampstead seem to stretch forever.

Another day, I detoured into **Leadenhall Market in the City** ‚Äî a glittering Victorian arcade with iron arches and cobblestones. The quiet hum of early morning made it feel like my own private movie set (though Harry Potter fans might recognize it as Diagon Alley). For skyline lovers, here‚Äôs a tip: skip the tourist queues at Sky Garden and take the lift to The Garden at 120. It‚Äôs free, uncrowded, and the view? Absolutely breathtaking.

[Leadenhall Market in the City](https://preview.redd.it/pspv3aq1jrif1.jpg?width=2645&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d02ba07bd88a94492aa66d13f36e2917a2986479)

Then came my favorite surprise ‚Äî a rainforest in the middle of brutalist architecture. Seriously. The Barbican Conservatory smells of wet leaves and fresh air, its tropical plants stretching to the high glass roof. In west London, **Kyoto Garden in Holland Park** offers stone paths, koi ponds, and a waterfall so soothing you forget you‚Äôre in the middle of a bustling city. And for something older, the Chelsea Physic Garden whispers secrets of medicinal plants cultivated since the 1600s.

[Kyoto Garden in Holland Park](https://preview.redd.it/lt9d375qjrif1.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b98430c8967ba7b014a06e2fd122739756790ff4)

One weekend, I ventured to **Walthamstow‚Äôs God‚Äôs Own Junkyard**, where neon signs buzz and glow in every corner. It‚Äôs like stepping into a living pop-art dream. On a different mood, I found calm at the WWT London Wetland Centre, where herons skated low over rippling water and the city felt miles away. For pure serenity, I stumbled into **St John‚Äôs Lodge Garden in Regent‚Äôs Park** ‚Äî a hidden formal garden perfect for reading under sculpted greenery.

And then there‚Äôs the mystery of the Thames. When the tide is low, you can go mudlarking ‚Äî searching the riverbed for treasures from centuries past. Every little find ‚Äî a clay pipe, a shard of pottery ‚Äî feels like touching history.

The charm doesn‚Äôt stop there. London‚Äôs mews streets ‚Äî like **Kynance Mews** and St Luke‚Äôs Mews ‚Äî look straight out of a romance novel, with cobbles, ivy walls, and pastel-painted doors. And if you‚Äôre visiting at the right time, Eel Pie Island opens its artist studios for a rare peek into an artsy riverside community.

Humidity‚Äôs starting to dip, the weather‚Äôs all over the place, and your beard is along for the ride whether it likes it or not. One day it‚Äôs **sticky** and **hot**, and you‚Äôre sweating before you‚Äôve even finished your coffee.  
The next, you step outside and there‚Äôs a *crisp breeze* that makes your skin feel tight before you even hit the driveway.

We‚Äôre in that *awkward in-between season* where your beard can go from soft and hydrated to dry and wiry overnight.

For guys who like to keep things simple, this is where it can get a little tricky. You can‚Äôt always just set one beard routine and run it on autopilot until winter. Conditions are variable. The air‚Äôs still warm enough to pull moisture out, but not always humid enough to give much back. Your beard might need more one day and less the next.

So this week, we‚Äôre breaking down how to adapt your beard care for the dog days.  
We‚Äôll talk about what‚Äôs changing, what tools you actually need, how to adjust your daily routine without overcomplicating it, and why this is the perfect time to start prepping for September... better known around here as the official start of **beard season**.

# So, What‚Äôs Changing Right Now?

As we've taught before, beard hair is hygroscopic, so it naturally absorbs and releases water depending on the environment. This is why humidity matters so much.

* **Lower humidity** means your beard can‚Äôt pull as much water from the air. The result is hair that feels drier, cuticle scales are lifted, and frizz becomes more noticeable.
* **Unpredictable weather** can mean a hot, sweaty day followed by a cool, dry evening. Those swings can mess with your skin barrier and sebaceous balance.
* **Lingering sun exposure** still counts. Just because the calendar says ‚Äúlate summer‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean UV damage is off the table. Too much sun can weaken the cuticle, fade natural pigment, and increase brittleness.

This is why your beard might feel softer some mornings and rougher the next, because your environment is constantly shifting, and your routine needs to shift with it. So let's build it...

# The Dog Days Daily Beard Routine

As always, you don‚Äôt need 12 products. You don‚Äôt need to overthink it. But you *do* need to be consistent and responsive to what your beard is telling you each day. So let's build your routine.

**Morning baseline (every single day)**

1. **Cleanse.** As we always say, use a good soap or wash, but limit to 3 times per week or so. The focus here is balance.
2. **Slightly dampen.** Splash water on your beard and towel dry until it‚Äôs just slightly damp. This unlocks the hair‚Äôs aqueous layer and preps it for oil.
3. **Apply beard oil.** 5-10 drops of a well-formulated beard oil. Rub between your palms, work it into your beard, and comb through to distribute.
4. **Target with balm if needed.** If you‚Äôve got problem areas that you'd like to train, or you know the day will be windy or dry, use balm in those spots for control and protection.

# Adapting on Dry Days vs Humid Days

**Cooler, drier days:**

* Add a touch more oil than usual.
* Balm becomes more useful. Apply it after oil to slow transepidermal water loss, especially in exposed areas like the chin and sideburns.

**Warmer, humid days:**

* Stick to oil only. Balm can block ambient moisture absorption in high humidity.
* Focus on keeping the beard clean and rinsed. Humidity + sweat can accelerate buildup and dull the hair, and cause issues with your lipid barrier and acid mantle.

**In-between days (mild temps, moderate humidity):**  
This is the tricky middle ground, when it‚Äôs not necessarily dry, but not sticky hot either. These are the days and climates where you want to fine-tune without overdoing it.

* Oil as usual. 5-10 drops on a slightly damp beard.
* Light balm if needed. Only in trouble spots for shape or training, not all-over.
* Focus on balance. These days can swing either way, so pay attention to how your beard feels midday. If it feels rough or wiry by the afternoon, you may feel like you need a tiny reapplication of oil. That's fine to do!
* Watch your wash frequency as normal.
* Evening check-in. On these middle-ground days, it‚Äôs a good habit to run your fingers through your beard at night. If it feels dry, a small amount of oil before bed can keep you from waking up with a brittle, frizzy beard.

# Your Dog Days Beard Care Toolkit

* **Beard oil** \- Your foundation. Promotes hydration, nourishes, and keeps skin barrier and hair structure balanced.
* **Balm** \- For targeted styling, control, and moisture retention in dry air.
* **Comb** \- Distributes product evenly, detangles, and aligns hair.
* **Good beard soap** \- Cleanses excess sebum and buildup without nuking the skin barrier

# Adjusting on the Fly

* **Dry air / windy day?** Oil + balm.
* **Humidity spike?** Oil only, let the air help hydrate.
* **Outdoor work?** Cleanse at night and reapply oil before bed.
* **Unexpected plans?** Quick rinse, re-oil, comb-through, and a touch of balm where needed.

Late August is the warm-up for the real seasonal shift. By September, nights get cooler, indoor heating starts creeping back in, and the air pulls more moisture from your beard.

That‚Äôs where **beard butter** shines, for that deep conditioning, elasticity repair, and overnight recovery. Think of oil as the daily driver, balm as the steering control, and butter as the full-service garage visit. We're almost there, y'all!

So, use these tips to adjust your routine on the fly. Knowing what to use and how to use it and save you from throwing your whole game out of whack. Plus, it'll keep your beard soft and lustrous all year.

Beard smart, beard strong.

Have a great week, y'all!",1,1755081007.0,BeardTalk,1,0.67,False
