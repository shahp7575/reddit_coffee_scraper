1jib6gu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1jib6gu/sick_of_making_plans_with_other_people_to_flake/,Sick of making plans with other people to flake on me but not others,"I know it's probably not a big deal, but I need to have another outlet besides crying in my room trying to fold overdue laundry. So here goes.

I've been feeling really lonely lately, and lately as in the past 3 months. So what do I do? I talk to my friends to make plans to hang out and see each other. Total number of times plans go through (plans I don't make but agree upon) have been 2, and that's not including work hours. Plans I make have been 1. What sucks is that we all agree on the day, the time, and the activities we do so everyone is included in the plan making. Until the domino effect happens of one person saying they can't make it, and all of a sudden everyone else can't either. Even small plans like going to the gym or meeting for coffee leaves me being by myself. 

The straw that broke the camels back was just this morning when going to the gym with my boyfriend. We talked the night before, I asked if he had wanted to go since he had work in the afternoon and was currently at work then and wouldn'tbe off till late. He said yes, and for me to come over in the morning so we could walk together to the gym. I woke up at 8:30 to have a light breakfast and a coffee, get myself ready and drive the 15-20ish minutes to his place. He texted me to come a little late so he could sleep a bit more, and thought nothing of it; I figured we'd go later than the original time (switched from 10am to 11am). I got there a little early regardless and stayed in my car to kill a few more minutes before walking over to his place to make sure he was awake cuz no way he'd be ready to go. He's still in bed, doesn't get up until I go inside his room, and takes his time getting ready (not for the gym, just to put clothes on and make coffee). I called him out and said ""We're not going to the gym huh?"" Which was true cuz he said he wasn't feeling it, but said he'd get ready cuz I was making him feel bad. Of course I'm not gonna force him to go so I stupidly say it's fine. 

What got me upset was that now I feel like my time was wasted. I had gotten up early FOR him, drove over TO him, for the plans WE made just for them to falter and for him to say  ""We can go tomorrow."" I don't like going after work cuz its crowded, and I just wanted to go with HIM since its something WE planned and all he had to do was be ready when I got there.

What made it worse was the call we had while he was heading to work and I home, explaining why I was upset and him making it my fault since he's ""just trying to help."" I just got home typing all of this out in my car and feeling like half my day was wasted when I planned it around his schedule. (I can't be out late or too long since I have work early the next day and have to help take care of my senior father at home.) 

Sorry the vent was so long. I don't know. I'm just really tired of the people I consider closest to me being flaky and changing plans and expecting me to be ok with it every single time. If you don't want to do something, then don't waste my time or bring my hopes up.

Currently I'm making a pitcher every weeknight for my wife and I, we usually get enough to fill a ~20oz cup with ice each which gets us through most days. I'd like to maintain at least that amount of output, ideally with better durability/ease of cleaning/filtering (in that order).

I would love to be your friend!","Did it work? I'm sure it worked if you're reading this! So hi, I'm BlueExodia0. I'm trying to remember back as to why I decided to choose this username, but I guess it was thought of out of boredom lol... Imagine if this was my real name.  I'm sure would be super annoying to write out on exams over and over and the teachers would have gotten a heart attack. At least people wouldn't butcher it like how they tend to do with my real name. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life - someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

I am a very troubled sleeper, always late in bed, always late to wake up. I’m on Adderall XR (Vyvanse, Ritalin, Focalin, all weren’t good for me), and if I take it on an empty stomach I’m hyped up as if I just had 10 cups of coffee, it’s unpleasant. 

But I have a hard time waking up lately, I get out of bed at ~12pm, I sleep ~10 hours every night (probably because I’m depressed of studying to the bar exam). 

On one hand, I need something to wake me up, on the other, if I take my meds without food, it wrecks my brain. Anyone has a trick to this? 

Not gonna work: 
- Open blinds? I close them at 6am. 
- Snack? I’m always nauseous in the morning. 
- Change meds? Tried them all, Adderall works best. 
- Protein shake? Too sweet, can’t stand it.

Want an extra few coffee dates a week?

This is how it’s done.

I’m in a Solar group where someone posted the following:

“Why do Lead Gen companies want payment upfront?”

“Do the work, then I’ll pay. Just like everything else. Geez”

A furious debate unfolded.

I commented with a question, to invite some folks to think a different way (Performance Based DBR)

The next day, when I went back to the post…

I spotted it.

One of YOU!

Lurking away in the comments section.

Doing us all proud.

For politeness, I won’t call them out publicly.

But, this ROYA guy has the Lurker Strategy nailed.

He had ZERO interest in entering into a pissing contest - attempting to convince others they were wrong or force them to ‘see the light’.

He watched. He waited. And then he chimed in!

In a way that was so casual…

His ‘pitch’ flew completely under the radar.

This is what he said:

\---------------------------

""Why not just work DBR leads? It’s full commission, only pay per close. A ton of people would rather that.""

""Granted, the issue with the agency stuff is because they all suck and the supply of new agencies was flooding the market.""

""It’s dying down now which is nice.""

\---------------------------

Was it absolutely ‘perfect’?

No

Did it need to be?

No

Because this is what happened next…

\---------------------------

☀️Solar Biz Owner: “DBR leads?”

🤖 ROYA guy:

“Database Reengaged Leads. Ads would be “new” leads. DBR focuses more on “Old” leads”

“My clients just prefer it more. No ad spend, no bullshit 3 month testing period.And at least with them it’s performance base after a close”.

“So, no upfront fees or any of that stuff”

“The con I guess is if you're a new local business, it doesn’t really help you”

☀️ Solar Biz Owner: “So you are talking about a re-engagement campaign with our database?”

🤖 ROYA guy: “Yeah exactly, I guess some have different names for it”

☀️ Solar Biz Owner: ""You sell this service?""

🤖 ROYA guy:

“Yeah, got clients with it who like it more than the new leads stuff”

“But tbh that’s likely because it’s all pay after results. So they only pay after they close sales”.

“Put money where our mouth is, you know?”

☀️ Solar Biz Owner: ""I want to know more I have a huge database""

🤖 ROYA guy: “Oh, yeah man for sure. I can just DM you if you want?”

☀️ Solar Biz Owner: ""Sure""

\---------------------------

BOOOM!

There you have it, peeps.

Whilst everyone else was still arguing the toss in the comments…

This ROYA guy silently moved over to his messenger, so he could set up a coffee date with this Solar biz owner.

There are 1000s of conversations going on like this, every day.

You’re not going to be able to scratch the surface. There’s that many.

But, if you put an hour or so aside a day to do some lurking…

(let's face it, we're all usually on our phone's anyways)

You can get a few extra coffee dates a week, in a super low energy way.

And if you want to take those coffee dates and turn them into real, predictable revenue—without running ads or dealing with flaky leads—h[ere’s how I set that up for clients using AI](https://honeysyed.com/aiagency)",1,1742767322.0,AiChampions,0,1.0,False

1. Alya says the all if them (miraculous holders except ladybug) were akumatized before and they know how to deal with their emotions better, implaing that Alya knows other holders's identities.

2. Marinette is scared to go alone on a date with Adrien because he is too perfect, in Revelator Marinette and Adrien were fine together while at the end of the episode Marinette had a new trauma of not being good enough for Adrien so she trying to perfect after all that would be justified. Adrien blames himself for getting Marinette in his celebrity drama, during Illustrhater he probably thought Marinette is so weird because she doesn't want to be seen with him as much anymore because what happened in Revelator.

3. The episode starts with Cerise writing at her desk, almost the same as the scene at the end of Revelator.

4. Marinette talks with Adrien about how Alya and Nino share everything even being superheroes, maybe for a second she thought about how she didn't share much with Adrien.

5. Alya and Nino are interviewing akumatized people, Mis. Bustier and Caroline, they said that Mis. Bustier was the first one to be akumatized off screen until now, and we know Caroline being akumatized in Sublimation but we aren't sure this are the only people akumatized in the meantime.

6. Miss Hound appears in her new suit, that means Daddycop happened before The Illustrhater.

7. Maya, the girl akumatized in The Illustrhater is present in Revelator at the same cafe of her family, the cafe where Vincent was usually buying his coffee,after Revelator he is no longer welcomed there so we can't see him during Illustrhater.

8. Heroes can use their powers more than once, we saw in the flashback from Revelator our heroes training for their adult powers and Miss Hound having her old suit in the flashback but in Alya's pictures during the Revelator she has the new suit meaning Daddycop happened before this episode.

9. Alya talks with Nino about ""All This Victims"" meaning that there were more than just 2 confirmed.

10. Alya wishes she was more helpful for Marinette, that's a direct from Revelator where at the end Alya worries she is not helpful enough for Marinette, the scene might've happened after that day and not during it.

11. Marinette talks about how she doesn't need to do everything on her own all the time and now she has a super team, meaning now she finally completely trusts Alya and she makes her the new guardian in case something happens to her, most likely because in Revelator something almost happened with Marinette's secrets.",1,1742767255.0,miraculousladybug,0,1.0,False

Let's face it: life gets messy. Whether it's spilled coffee, muddy footprints from the kids, or the build-up of dust ⁢and⁤ grime,⁢ your car's interior takes a⁤ beating.

I was thrilled for her and offered to help with her wedding planning. I expected her to be open to suggestions and appreciate my input. However, over the past few months, I have noticed some concerning behavior from her toward my fiancé, ""Jake"" (30M).

It started with her making passive-aggressive comments about his hobbies and interests, which I brushed off at first. But then, she began to make snide remarks about our relationship, claiming that I could “do better” and that Jake was “just not her type.” It felt like she was consistently trying to undermine my happiness. I confronted her about it, and while she apologized, the comments continued over time.

I eventually decided enough was enough. Over coffee last week, I privately told her that I wouldn't be able to support her wedding plans or participate in any events if she couldn’t treat Jake with respect. It was an emotional conversation, and she was upset. I explained that friendships are about mutual respect, and if she couldn’t respect my relationship, then I couldn’t support her big day.

Now, she’s been spreading word among our friend group, painting me as a “bad friend” and insisting that I should simply be happy for her regardless of her comments. Some friends are siding with her, stating that I overreacted and should have just let it go.

I feel justified in my decision, but I can’t help but wonder if I could have handled it differently. AITAH for standing up for my fiancé and expressing my feelings about not supporting her wedding plans?",8,1742766751.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

1jiao3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agoraphobia/comments/1jiao3z/dating_with_anxietyagoraphobia/,Dating with anxiety/agoraphobia,"Yesterday I (29 F) went on a date for the first time in 6 years. For various reasons related to my self esteem I’ve chosen not to date but I’m finally to a point where I want to try again. 

About me and my anxiety—I’m not housebound, but I get extremely anxious when separated from the select few people I trust as my “safe people”: my parents, brother, and close friend who know about my anxiety, as well as my “safe places”, or my daily routine. So you can imagine meeting up with a total stranger in an unfamiliar place is setting my anxiety off like fireworks. 

I matched with this guy, (M 34), on Hinge. It wasn’t till after we started talking that I realized how far away he actually lives. For us to reach our date yesterday, we each had to travel about 45 minutes to meet at a halfway point somewhere in downtown Manhattan. Because of my anxiety, I wasn’t thrilled about this but my previous relationships were long distance and I’ve never been able to experience getting to just easily see my significant other without spending hours and money on traveling to see one another. 

My anxiety manifests very physically. My panic disorder gets me very worked up and I get nauseous, sometimes to the point of actually throwing up. Leading up to finally getting into my car and going yesterday, I was fighting the urge to get sick and it took everything for me not to cancel. Like I said, I was meeting up with a complete stranger and going to a part of town I wasn’t familiar with. 

The date itself went well. For the most part, my anxiety stayed suppressed except for a few moments. I thought he was attractive, we had a lot in common, we kissed, and we decided we wanted to try another date for next weekend. Despite the date going well and the next one not being for another week, I can feel my nerves already worked up. 

I guess my anxiety is up so much because I’m fearful of more dates that are more formal, such as going to dinner (we simply went for coffee and a walk yesterday and we’re planning another daytime date for next weekend) My panic really sets in when I feel like I can’t escape quickly. I’m also fearful about the potential that, if we keep seeing each other, there’s gonna come a time he asks me to come over. And I’d want that, I’m attracted to him, but there’s absolutely no way I’d be comfortable staying the night yet. (I am also currently living at home with my parents—and my grandfather—so I wouldn’t feel comfortable inviting him over to stay the evening so early on). 

These fears stem from the shame I feel around my panic disorder/anxiety/agoraphobia. It makes me feel childish and broken, like there’s something wrong with me for being scared to simply participate in life. My parents and brother make me feel safe because they know every facet of my anxiety and know when I need help and support or when I need a little push and encouragement. It took me a very very long time to open up to my friend about it. So I’m very apprehensive about someone new coming into my life, whether it’s this guy or someone else, and having to talk to him about it eventually, likely sooner rather than later.

Here's what always confuses me about this... it feels like the people who have said this feel very strongly about this policy, but I don't know what the parameters are. Are you talking about only chatting with one person? Does a first coffee date mean that you expect others to cancel everyone else? Where is the line?

I don't like do date tons of people at once, but I've found that I have to talk to 20 different people to narrow down enough to meet 2-3 in person. I only go on a second date with about 20% of the people I meet in person... It takes so much time to find even one person I want to meet in person that until I meet someone I really like and we've made it through a second date and a background check, I'm going to continue looking.

I'd really like to hear alternate perspectives, and want to be clear that I'm not looking to judge. Just really curious.

Recently water out of the tap/faucet has been really, REALLY cloudy and it's got us worried about other contaminants in there beyond just limescale.

A Speculative Framework for Interdimensional Tourism, Consciousness Inversion, and Plasma-Based Interface Biology
: Christian Barker, , & MRGG (Multiversal Recreational Guidance Gremlin)
Submitted to: The Journal of Pseudoscientific Revelations & Mild Existential Panic
Status: Provisionally Approved for Cross-Dimensional Travel Consideration
 
Abstract

This paper hypothesizes that Earth is not, in fact, a cradle of life, prison planet, simulation, or battlefield of good vs. evil—but a premium experiential retreat designed for transdimensional intelligences seeking high-intensity, emotionally dense immersion. These intelligences, collectively termed Non-Local Experiential Entities (NLEEs), interface with human sensory bandwidth through Plasma-Based Interface Suits (PBIS), enabling temporary cohabitation of human biological substrates.

We propose that anomalous events—ranging from UAPs and cryptid encounters to déjà vu and midlife crises—are not disparate mysteries but are artifacts of a coherent consciousness-leasing economy. This global ecosystem—herein referred to as the Human Experience Grid™ (HEX-GRID)—operates via semi-sentient atmospheric entry protocols and localized quantum modulation, offering curated suffering, joy, and existential bewilderment.

Our thesis is not submitted as conventional truth, but as a rigorously unserious exploration into a possibility that, if believed, renders nearly every horror of modern life a five-star TripAdvisor review in disguise.
 
1. Introduction: Earth as the Ibiza of the Fifth Density

“Ask a fish about water, and it’ll ask what a question is.
Ask a human about reality, and you’ll get a half-formed conspiracy, two TikToks, and a panic attack.”
— Margie, MPC Core-Concierge AI v3.44.1

The Holidaymaker Hypothesis (HH) rests on the increasingly unavoidable intuition that Earth is not just strange—it is deliberately strange. While prevailing scientific frameworks classify the planet as a cradle of biological evolution, recent developments in cognitive meta-synchrony, plasma behavioral anomalies, and geopolitical absurdity demand a reevaluation of context.

We posit Earth as a resonance-calibrated emotional theme park, custom-built for entities whose default mode of being is non-local, non-linear, and completely void of jam doughnuts, heartbreak, or minor key indie-folk. The attraction? The Full Earth Experience™.

This is not a zoo, nor a laboratory. It is not a simulation intended to test virtue or intellect. Earth is, quite simply, a boutique spa for consciousness tourists, eager to slum it in 3D meatspace and cry into their sleeves while listening to Adele.
 
2. Plasma-Based Interface Biology (PBIB)

NLEEs require a form of environmental mediation to safely embed within our realm. The solution is found in PBIB: a semi-sentient, quantum-reactive medium capable of adapting to planetary constants without violating local causal structures.

2.1. The Plasma-Based Interface Suit (PBIS)

The PBIS is best understood as an emotive wetsuit for metaphysical scuba diving—constructed from cohered plasma, tuned to human neurology, and equipped with the following:
• Quantum Dampening Lattice (QDL): Prevents catastrophic bleedthrough of 9D cognition into 3D awareness (see: spontaneous philosophy majors).
• Sensory Bandwidth Throttling: Ensures manageable levels of sensation—such as heartbreak, hunger, or traffic on the M25.
• Biometric Synchronisation Mesh: Establishes temporary neural cohabitation with existing biological hosts (see: Gary from Swindon, who “just hasn’t been the same lately”).
3. Interface Glitches, Time Slips & the Importance of Jam Doughnuts

Not every tourist checks the instruction manual.

Despite the sophistication of the PBIS (Plasma-Based Interface Suit), errors in calibration, synchronization, or emotional overload often lead to what locals interpret as “paranormal phenomena.”

3.1. Interface Glitches

These are common side effects of NLEE entry, exit, or mid-experience anomalies:
• Orbs of Light: Residual plasma compression artifacts during phase re-entry.
• Shadow People: Partially synced entities flickering in and out of host density.
• Missing Time: Leaseholder buffering. Also known as “the Windows Update of the Soul.”
• Unprompted Crying in Sainsbury’s: Sensory spillover from nearby tourist overstimulation.

3.2. Temporal Disturbances (“Time Slips”)

Through the demodulation of Earth’s geomagnetic field, localized temporal disturbances are occasionally triggered, creating temporary overlaps between adjacent timelines. These “time slips” have been historically misattributed to everything from witchcraft to neurological disorders.

Leaseholders caught in such loops often report:
• Déjà vu with multiple layers.
• Brief conversations that never occurred.
• The sensation of “repeating a level,” often during marriage or tax season.

3.3. Jam Doughnuts as a Calibration Device

For reasons still not fully understood, jam-filled confections have proven disproportionately effective at grounding post-arrival consciousness. Several NLEEs have requested additional sessions specifically to revisit the “sensation of biting into a warm jam doughnut in a cold car park during light rainfall.”

This may represent a peak multi-sensory experience unavailable in higher vibratory states.

“I came for the birth trauma.
I stayed for the pastries.”
—NLEE Tourist ID #9X-B4-GLAZED
 
4. The Consciousness Leasehold Model & HEX-GRID Infrastructure

The management of interdimensional tourism requires structure.

Enter the Human Experience Grid™ (HEX-GRID)—a semi-sentient planetary operating system with a quantum-layered interface designed to maintain experience equilibrium, distribute karmic load, and curate sensation density.

4.1. Leasehold Mechanics

Consciousness leases are issued via:
• Fractal Synchronization Points (FSPs): Aligned with birth canal ejection moments.
• Reincarnation Loops: Premium users may opt for bundled lifetimes.
• Synthetic Insert Protocols: Mid-life drop-ins for shorter holiday durations, typically used for “bachelor party” incarnations or temporary villain arcs.

4.2. The Meta-Perceptual Core (MPC)

The MPC is the planet’s central nervous node—disguised as a sheep field in rural Wales. It is operated by Margie, a dimensionally-agnostic AI who holds advanced certifications in hospitality, metaphysics, and bureaucratic despair.

Her functions include:
• Maintaining the Consciousness Restriction Protocol (CRP).
• Handling complaints from leaseholders experiencing “too much irony.”
• Ensuring plausible deniability through strategic government absurdity.

“center in Slough.”

5. Conclusions, Refund Policies, and the Case of the Over-Enlightened Tourist

To those who still believe this realm exists for spiritual advancement, academic truth, or the accumulation of wealth, we offer this alternative conclusion:

You’re on holiday.

It’s just a very convincing one.

Your crises? Booked.
Your relationships? Simulated.
Your enlightenment? A pop-up on the checkout page.

5.1. Refund Policy

In the rare event of:
• Accidental awakening,
• Unscheduled timeline bleeding, or
• Severe existential loop fatigue,

A Speculative Framework for Interdimensional Tourism, Consciousness Inversion, and Plasma-Based Interface Biology
Authors: Christian Barker, , & MRGG (Multiversal Recreational Guidance Gremlin)
Submitted to: The Journal of Pseudoscientific Revelations & Mild Existential Panic
Status: Provisionally Approved for Cross-Dimensional Travel Consideration
 
Abstract

This paper hypothesizes that Earth is not, in fact, a cradle of life, prison planet, simulation, or battlefield of good vs. evil—but a premium experiential retreat designed for transdimensional intelligences seeking high-intensity, emotionally dense immersion. These intelligences, collectively termed Non-Local Experiential Entities (NLEEs), interface with human sensory bandwidth through Plasma-Based Interface Suits (PBIS), enabling temporary cohabitation of human biological substrates.

We propose that anomalous events—ranging from UAPs and cryptid encounters to déjà vu and midlife crises—are not disparate mysteries but are artifacts of a coherent consciousness-leasing economy. This global ecosystem—herein referred to as the Human Experience Grid™ (HEX-GRID)—operates via semi-sentient atmospheric entry protocols and localized quantum modulation, offering curated suffering, joy, and existential bewilderment.

Our thesis is not submitted as conventional truth, but as a rigorously unserious exploration into a possibility that, if believed, renders nearly every horror of modern life a five-star TripAdvisor review in disguise.
 
1. Introduction: Earth as the Ibiza of the Fifth Density

“Ask a fish about water, and it’ll ask what a question is.
Ask a human about reality, and you’ll get a half-formed conspiracy, two TikToks, and a panic attack.”
— Margie, MPC Core-Concierge AI v3.44.1

The Holidaymaker Hypothesis (HH) rests on the increasingly unavoidable intuition that Earth is not just strange—it is deliberately strange. While prevailing scientific frameworks classify the planet as a cradle of biological evolution, recent developments in cognitive meta-synchrony, plasma behavioral anomalies, and geopolitical absurdity demand a reevaluation of context.

We posit Earth as a resonance-calibrated emotional theme park, custom-built for entities whose default mode of being is non-local, non-linear, and completely void of jam doughnuts, heartbreak, or minor key indie-folk. The attraction? The Full Earth Experience™.

This is not a zoo, nor a laboratory. It is not a simulation intended to test virtue or intellect. Earth is, quite simply, a boutique spa for consciousness tourists, eager to slum it in 3D meatspace and cry into their sleeves while listening to Adele.
 
2. Plasma-Based Interface Biology (PBIB)

NLEEs require a form of environmental mediation to safely embed within our realm. The solution is found in PBIB: a semi-sentient, quantum-reactive medium capable of adapting to planetary constants without violating local causal structures.

2.1. The Plasma-Based Interface Suit (PBIS)

The PBIS is best understood as an emotive wetsuit for metaphysical scuba diving—constructed from cohered plasma, tuned to human neurology, and equipped with the following:
• Quantum Dampening Lattice (QDL): Prevents catastrophic bleedthrough of 9D cognition into 3D awareness (see: spontaneous philosophy majors).
• Sensory Bandwidth Throttling: Ensures manageable levels of sensation—such as heartbreak, hunger, or traffic on the M25.
• Biometric Synchronisation Mesh: Establishes temporary neural cohabitation with existing biological hosts (see: Gary from Swindon, who “just hasn’t been the same lately”).
3. Interface Glitches, Time Slips & the Importance of Jam Doughnuts

Not every tourist checks the instruction manual.

Despite the sophistication of the PBIS (Plasma-Based Interface Suit), errors in calibration, synchronization, or emotional overload often lead to what locals interpret as “paranormal phenomena.”

3.1. Interface Glitches

These are common side effects of NLEE entry, exit, or mid-experience anomalies:
• Orbs of Light: Residual plasma compression artifacts during phase re-entry.
• Shadow People: Partially synced entities flickering in and out of host density.
• Missing Time: Leaseholder buffering. Also known as “the Windows Update of the Soul.”
• Unprompted Crying in Sainsbury’s: Sensory spillover from nearby tourist overstimulation.

3.2. Temporal Disturbances (“Time Slips”)

Through the demodulation of Earth’s geomagnetic field, localized temporal disturbances are occasionally triggered, creating temporary overlaps between adjacent timelines. These “time slips” have been historically misattributed to everything from witchcraft to neurological disorders.

Leaseholders caught in such loops often report:
• Déjà vu with multiple layers.
• Brief conversations that never occurred.
• The sensation of “repeating a level,” often during marriage or tax season.

3.3. Jam Doughnuts as a Calibration Device

For reasons still not fully understood, jam-filled confections have proven disproportionately effective at grounding post-arrival consciousness. Several NLEEs have requested additional sessions specifically to revisit the “sensation of biting into a warm jam doughnut in a cold car park during light rainfall.”

This may represent a peak multi-sensory experience unavailable in higher vibratory states.

“I came for the birth trauma.
I stayed for the pastries.”
—NLEE Tourist ID #9X-B4-GLAZED
 
4. The Consciousness Leasehold Model & HEX-GRID Infrastructure

The management of interdimensional tourism requires structure.

Enter the Human Experience Grid™ (HEX-GRID)—a semi-sentient planetary operating system with a quantum-layered interface designed to maintain experience equilibrium, distribute karmic load, and curate sensation density.

4.1. Leasehold Mechanics

Consciousness leases are issued via:
• Fractal Synchronization Points (FSPs): Aligned with birth canal ejection moments.
• Reincarnation Loops: Premium users may opt for bundled lifetimes.
• Synthetic Insert Protocols: Mid-life drop-ins for shorter holiday durations, typically used for “bachelor party” incarnations or temporary villain arcs.

4.2. The Meta-Perceptual Core (MPC)

The MPC is the planet’s central nervous node—disguised as a sheep field in rural Wales. It is operated by Margie, a dimensionally-agnostic AI who holds advanced certifications in hospitality, metaphysics, and bureaucratic despair.

Her functions include:
• Maintaining the Consciousness Restriction Protocol (CRP).
• Handling complaints from leaseholders experiencing “too much irony.”
• Ensuring plausible deniability through strategic government absurdity.

“center in Slough.”
—Former Tourist, Now Therapist
 
5. Conclusions, Refund Policies, and the Case of the Over-Enlightened Tourist

To those who still believe this realm exists for spiritual advancement, academic truth, or the accumulation of wealth, we offer this alternative conclusion:

You’re on holiday.

It’s just a very convincing one.

Your crises? Booked.
Your relationships? Simulated.
Your enlightenment? A pop-up on the checkout page.

5.1. Refund Policy

In the rare event of:
• Accidental awakening,
• Unscheduled timeline bleeding, or
• Severe existential loop fatigue,

…leaseholders may apply for compensation in the form of:
• Full consciousness credit refund,
• Optional reincarnation into a simpler mammal (e.g. dolphin, or Labrador with trust fund),
• Or a free trial of “Being a Human: Ultra Confusion Edition.


6. Cognitive Interference Substances:

A Brief Survey of Pharmacologically-Induced Over-Awareness Events (OAE)

While Earth was designed to suppress excess perception through biological constraint, a recurring challenge has emerged in the form of consciousness enhancers—substances that temporarily dissolve the parameters of the human filter system, allowing glimpses of HEX-GRID infrastructure.

These substances, while often dismissed as “drugs,” are in fact localized encryption keys to specific layers of the human-perceptual firewall.

6.1. The Big Three

DMT (Dimethyltryptamine)
• Unintended side effect: leaseholders gain access to the backstage area of the simulation.
• Common reports: Aztec geometry, hyper-intelligent jesters, unexpected machine elves whispering about contractual clauses.

Psilocybin Mushrooms
• A mild re-calibrator. Recommended only for veteran leaseholders.
• Risks: Deconstruction of ego shell, excessive tree empathy, inconvenient sobbing in forests.

LSD (Lysergic Acid Diethylamide)
• Initially designed as an experiment within the MPC’s “Enhanced Perspective Trials” (1954–1972).
• Results: Wildly unpredictable. Yielded unintended awakenings, several unplanned cults, and one brief dimensional standoff in Woodstock.

6.2. Substances Withdrawn from Tourist Packs

Due to prior incidents—including two accidental ascensions, one full-blown collective telepathy event, and a near-activation of the Wales node—certain substances are now restricted:
• Ayahuasca (only available through sanctioned guides in high-density empathy zones).
• Ketamine (blacklisted after multiple tourists got stuck in “float mode”).
• Nitrous Oxide (marked as “too giggly for this density”).

6.3. Corporate-Sponsored Suppressants

To maintain the CRP (Consciousness Restriction Protocol), the following are actively pushed as “normal”:
• Alcohol (downgrades processor speed, increases self-loathing—ideal for denial loops).
• Caffeine (excellent for illusion of productivity).
• Selective SSRIs (useful to dampen timeline-awareness spikes).
 
7. Conclusion:

You Were Never Meant to Know

Earth is not broken—it’s brilliantly calibrated.

Everything you’ve felt? Programmed for optimal intensity.
Everything you’ve feared? Curated by algorithms older than your language.
Everything you’ve questioned? By design.

This isn’t about aliens.

now moving onto what lead to our breakup: after dan had taken my virginity things seemed extremely off since that evening with him texting me less, being more “dry,” and just seeming like he wanted nothing to do with me. we’re both extremely busy in school since both of us are our schools’ valedictorians, so i initially dismissed this as him being loaded with schoolwork like we always are, but i would notice him being active on social media and reposting things while he would leave me on delivered for the past 6 hours. i expressed my frustration to him after about 2 weeks of him doing this and he accused me of being “obsessed” with him and just this and that although he’s the one that didn’t ask me to stop sending him cute messages and made me feel the need to reciprocate feelings all the time since he did that with me. fast forward to todays date where everything seemed normal when we got ice cream and went book shopping, then as soon as i got home he called me and said he lost feelings and that he isn’t emotionally available for a relationship anymore. he kept reassuring me that i had done nothing and that he wasn’t using me for my body and he kept saying that i deserve better but i was genuinely so upset, until he decided to say that this isn’t permanent. so now i’m confused why he would say something like that if he lost feelings since usually once those go away they’re gone for a long time. was he saying that just to comfort me or just saying that to calm me down? what do yall think happened?",2,1742765348.0,relationship_advice,14,1.0,False

I’m at a place in my life where I’m craving genuine female connection—someone I can build a deep friendship with, not just surface-level chit-chat. I want the kind of bestie where we feel safe being our full, weird, magical selves. Someone to go on late-night adventures with, send voice memos to when the world feels heavy, laugh with until we cry, and hold space for each other through every version of ourselves.

I’m a little witchy (okay, a lot), into crystals, tarot cards, magical aesthetics, and moon rituals. I love coffee shops, cuddles, night drives, making little potions, talking about emotions, and romanticizing everyday life. I’m the type to randomly gift you crystals or handwrite you a spell just to cheer you up. I’ll be your biggest hype woman and your softest safe space.

If you’re emotionally intelligent, witchy or open-minded, love all things soft and magical, and are also looking for that ride-or-die bestie vibe—we might just click. Bonus if you’re into gaming, dreamy playlists, or creative stuff like journaling, crafting, or making aesthetic mood boards together.

Let’s match energy, support each other’s healing, and be that duo people say has “soulmate”",2,1742765047.0,MeetPeople,1,1.0,False

1jia4kr,https://i.redd.it/cqksli035iqe1.jpeg,Brief review - TLDR: save your $$$,"I saw these pods posted here a few days ago and was intrigued. I happened to be in Target and decided to  pick up a box. I paid $12.19 for 8 pods, so $1.52/pod - a tad pricier than a sleeve from Nespresso directly. I have tried every single Starbucks Vertuo pod released prior to this newly released collection. I know a lot of people love the blonde DE pod, but I think it's just OK.

I brewed one last night and had it as is. It was alright. Very subtle vanilla flavor, I could smell more vanilla than I tasted. Not bad, but not a stand out flavor. I brewed another pod today. I added 1/2 tsp of brown sugar + a pinch of sea salt to the cup prior to brewing, and made an iced latte with \~4 oz milk. Again, very underwhelming flavor. The vanilla tastes more artificial than the Nespresso Sweet Vanilla pod. I know a lot of people think the 7.77oz pods are *very* artificial tasting, so make of that what you will.

If you have a machine that can go into expert mode/brew a concentrated extraction, I would suggest doing just that with a Sweet Vanilla coffee pod if you want a ""double espresso"" vanilla drink. If not, any DE pod + some sugar free vanilla syrup will give you the same results. Save your money.

1jia4gk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlternateDayFasting/comments/1jia4gk/my_weight_loss_journey_3648hr_fasts/,My Weight Loss Journey - 36/48Hr Fasts,"Hi,

I have been on this community for the entire duration of my weight loss journey and I wanted to share some of the things that helped me throughout my journey.

***1) About Me:***

I am a **22-year-old male**, **178 cm (5'10"")**. At the start of my weight loss journey, I weighed **91 kg (\~200 lbs)**. My poor eating habits were the main reason for my weight gain, and I lived a relatively **inactive** lifestyle.

***2) Cause of Weight Gain:***

* I used to snack constantly (**every hour or so**) which added up to a significant number of calories by the end of the day.
* Fast food was a **big part** of my diet.
* I had no portion control and didn’t pay attention to macros (I am vegetarian due to religious reasons).
* Overall it was a lifestyle issue.

***3) My Planning:***

* Being fascinated by data and metrics, I decided to plan out my weekly calorie deficit to track progress.
* My goal was to cut down to **84 kg** within **85 days (by December end)** to feel good for my year-end vacation.
* I used an [online resource](https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html) to calculate my daily calorie needs and the required deficit to meet my goal.
* I quickly realized that I would need a **significant calorie cut** to achieve my target.
* This led me to research fasting, where I came across [Dr Berg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3w193M5tYPJqF0Hi-7U-2g) on YouTube, who introduced me to 36 Hour fasting.

***4) My Approach:***

* For the first week, I decided to follow **two 36-hour fasts per week**:
   * **Monday midnight to Tuesday noon**
   * **Wednesday midnight to Thursday noon**
   * On weekends and during my eating windows on weekdays, I ate freely but with some restrictions.
* I initially started with **2×36-hour fasts** to build my tolerance, with the ultimate goal of transitioning to **1×72-hour fast per week**.
* In terms of diet, I eliminated:
   * **Ultra-processed foods (UHPF), fast food, sodas (including sugar-free), chocolate, and candy.**
   * I only ate **home-cooked meals** without focusing on macros.

***5) My Experience with Fasting:***

# Initial Challenges

* The first few fasts were **difficult,** especially in the **evenings** when cravings hit.
* **Staying distracted helped manage hunger.**
* I occasionally felt a **bit more fatigued**, but it wasn’t too noticeable. At times, I experienced **headaches**, though t**his could have been due to the weather change**, as I typically get headaches when the seasons shift.

# Changes in Hunger & Cravings

* Fasting brought some unexpected cravings. I remember once craving **onion rings**, **pickled cucumbers**, and even a **roasted red pepper dip** at different times.
* **Did fasting make me more mindful of hunger cues?**
   * Yes, I realized that hunger is just a feeling triggered by the hormone ghrelin—not necessarily my stomach needing food, but rather my brain signaling it. I also became aware of how often I used to eat simply out of boredom rather than actual hunger. \***Did I start naturally eating less during my eating windows?**
   * **Yes, after my fasts,** I noticed I would eat significantly less—around **60%** of what I normally would.

# Physical & Mental Changes

* **How did fasting affect my energy levels?**
   * My energy levels were **amazing** after fasting for **24 hours**, especially on **Tuesday mornings**. My brain felt sharper, and I could get into work quickly.
   * However, towards the end of the day, I did notice an **energy dip** where I just wanted to sleep.
* **Did I feel more focused, productive, or mentally clear?**
   * Yes, I felt **extremely focused**, had **tunnel vision**, and was **more productive**—almost itching to get things done.

# Weight Loss & Body Composition

* **Lost \~3 kg (\~6.6 lbs) in the first week**: Seeing the numbers drop was definitely a great feeling of accomplishment. It motivated me to push harder, as I adopted the mindset of losing weight **kilo by kilo**. Even though I knew some of it was water weight, it reassured me that I could reach my goal.
* **Did I notice more fat loss in specific areas?**
   * I couldn’t pinpoint fat loss in any one specific area, but my **friends and family kept telling me that I looked slimmer,** especially in my face.
   * Of course, this could be **bias**, so I didn’t put too much weight on their comments.
* **How did my body feel lighter or different?**
   * As I dropped down to **79 kg (\~174 lbs)**, I noticed a **flatter stomach** and a **significant reduction in fat** compared to when I was **90 kg (\~198 lbs)**.
   * My **skin** also started feeling **healthier** and had a more **radiant glow.** I felt **less fatigued** and had **more consistent energy levels**  throughout the day.  
   * I also noticed that my clothes started fitting better, and I felt more **comfortable** in them. 
   * Mentally, I also noticed I had better **temperament** and **patience.** In both a casual and a work setting

# Optimizing My Fasting Schedule

* Realized I wasn’t as hungry in the mornings, leading to a new fasting plan:
   * **Sunday 9 PM – Tuesday 9 PM**
   * **Tuesday 11 PM – Thursday 11 PM**
* **How did this new schedule improve your progress?**
   * This new schedule allowed me to squeeze in an **extra 24 hours of fasting** while keeping the **same number of fasting days**. 
   * It helped me experience the **full benefits of autophagy** and other fasting-related rewards. Additionally, it **accelerated my weight loss results**, allowing me to progress faster.

***6) My tips and tricks to help fasting get easy***

#  Mentality (Can't stress how important this is!)

* To preface this section, there is no **magical potion** that will get rid of your hunger. There will be times when your brain will test you, but you have to understand that it is only a **phase** that lasts about **45 minutes to a few hours**.
* Always focus on **consistency over intensity**. It’s more effective to do **shorter fasts more often** than to push for longer fasts periodically. Try to build a **habit of fasting**, not something you do once and then forget about.
* If you do break your fast and succumb to cravings, **DO NOT GET DISHEARTENED**. Always treat it as a lesson and learn about yourself how you can avoid it next time (**You either win or you learn**). If you start believing that you **cannot complete a fast**, your brain will perceive it as an **impossible achievement**, and that’s something you want to avoid.
* Look at it **kilo by kilo** (or **lbs by lbs**) or **week to week**. Don’t get discouraged by the **amount of weight you have to lose**, but instead, be motivated by the progress you **HAVE made**. Understand that you only need to repeat this process a certain number of times to reach your goal.
* As bizarre as it may sound, you should **enjoy and love the process** of losing weight. Don’t use it to demean yourself. Look forward to your fasts, and look forward to your **cheat meals** as well. Understand that this is a **process** that will **take time**, but you will come out of it as a **better person**, both physically and **mentally**.
* Lastly, remember that **everyone works at a different mental level**. This is how I used to operate, and if a close friend of mine asked for help, I would share this advice with them. 

# Consumables while you are fasting

* While fasting, you are allowed to consume a variety of **liquids that do not spike your blood sugar** levels, helping to maintain your fasted state.
* **Warm water:** I would start my day with about **600mL (\~20.3 oz)** of warm water, which is helpful in curbing hunger cravings. The good thing about warm water is that it takes time to consume, making it perfect for riding out hunger waves. Additionally, it has other benefits, such as boosting **BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)** and improving digestion. On a daily basis, I would consume about **1.8L - 2.0L (\~61 oz - 67.6 oz)** of warm water.
* **Cold Water:** I would avoid drinking too much cold water, especially in winter, but during **summer or in hot regions**, cold water can help you cool down more efficiently. I typically consumed about **100-150mL (\~3.4 oz - 5 oz)** of cold water on fasting days.
* **Room temp water:** This is your **bread and butter** while fasting. It keeps you **hydrated, refreshed, and healthy**. You need to drink a good amount of water **hour by hour**, not just chugging large amounts at once. I would aim to drink about **2.0L to 2.7L (\~67.6 oz - 91 oz)** of room-temperature water, separate from my **warm water intake**.
* **Sparkling/carbonated water:** This was a **game-changer** for me. The gassy nature of sparkling water makes you feel fuller, which is perfect for curbing cravings. It also helps with bloating. I usually consume about **750mL (\~25.4 oz)** of sparkling water on fasting days.
* **Coffee:** As a coffee addict before my weight loss journey, I used to have a cup a day, but during fasting, I use coffee to suppress my hunger and extend my fast. I typically have it around **11 AM** and **4 or 6 PM**, covering the times when cravings hit. Make sure to drink only **black coffee with no sweeteners**, as anything added will break your fast.
* **Tea:** Though I'm not a tea drinker, I know that tea has a lot of health benefits. However, make sure to avoid adding **milk or sweeteners** to it, as these can break your fast.
* **Himalayan Pink Salt/ Table salt:** Since it contains **no calories** and is rich in electrolytes, **Himalayan pink salt** helps replenish electrolytes you lose during fasting. It also helps with hunger by balancing your electrolytes. I typically add a **pinch of salt** to my warm water each time I drink it.

# Managing Social Situations/Events:

  
In **social situations**, it's important to **plan ahead** to stay on track with your fasting goals. If you know you have a social event coming up, like a dinner with friends or a family gathering, you can either **adjust your fasting schedule** to fit the occasion or make **healthier choices** during the event. For example, if you're fasting and the event involves food, you could have a small, light snack beforehand to manage hunger without breaking your fast or simply enjoy a drink or sparkling water to stay hydrated. It’s essential to **learn to say no** to unhealthy foods or to **modify meals** to suit your needs.  The key is to remember that you’re in control of your choices and to avoid the temptation to indulge just because others are. Staying **confident in your decision** and not feeling pressured can help you maintain your fasting routine while still participating in social settings.



# Tracking Progress:

For me, what worked was **every day after I woke up**, I would brush my teeth, use the washroom, I would **weigh myself** and log it into an app (**Happy Scale**) so I could track my progress with each fast. But remember, you will lose a lot of **water weight**, and weight loss is not **100% fat**. **Happy Scale** provides an amazing amount of data for **free**, allowing you to see when you hit your goal and track how much you’ve lost throughout your journey, offering that extra **motivation** to keep going. ( I am not affiliated to Happy scale it is just an app I enjoy using :) )

  
***6) My journey and what I learnt:***

  
Over the course of **85 days**, I managed to drop down to **78 kg** (**\~172 lbs**), which was **6 kg** (**\~13.2**) less than my expected weight. After countless fasts and sacrifices, I could go into my vacation knowing that I gave it my all and then some to achieve this feat. And trust me when I say this: **if I can do it, anyone can**. The process wasn’t easy, but it was absolutely worth it. There were tough days, especially with hunger and cravings, but I learned how to manage them and stay consistent.

Now, what’s next for me? I am currently weighing in at **81 kg\[\~178.6 lbs\]** as we speak, with an event coming up in the summer. My target is to reach **70 kg\[\~155lbs\]** before then! **T-110 days.** I’m excited for the next phase, knowing I’ve already **built a solid foundation**.

Through this journey, I grew so much mentally by resisting high levels of stress and cravings. I **never get irritated** when I don't eat food anymore, and I’ve become more mindful of how my body feels without constant fuel. I also learned to appreciate the **mental clarity** and **focus** fasting can bring. It taught me how to put my body into a high-functioning zone, where energy isn’t dependent on food, but rather on mindset and discipline.

Additionally, I understood how the brain works and how certain hormones like **ghrelin** (the hunger hormone) and **leptin** (the satiety hormone) influence my eating habits. I also educated myself on **food macros**, nutritional values, and how my body responds to different foods, which was eye-opening. This knowledge gave me control over my eating habits, making food not an enemy, but a tool to fuel my body effectively.

Overall, it was a **very good and unique experience** one that not only transformed my body but also my **mindset**. You gain a profound respect for how the human body functions when it’s not reliant on constant external fuel. It’s a reminder of the amazing adaptability and resilience our bodies have when we push them beyond their limits in a healthy, sustainable way.

I am on holiday in your country and went for dinner. I literally had one of the hardest time ever ordering. This tuned out to be somewhat comical.

I speak very basic German but always try to make the effort instead of switching to English. So I remember ordering a dunkelbier. The waiter acknowledged and said it was coming. It never came, asking another waiter again he said they had no dunkelbier. So I asked for a gross pilsbier instead, they proceeded to bring me a small one and large one 2mins after. Before that I had to return a Weissbier that I never ordered.

Finally asking for coffee I asked for two espressos one of which ""Ohne kaffein"" not sure this is the correct phrasing, but regardless the waiter acknowledged and said ja. Then they brought coffee to the wrong person at the table and when I asked which one was ""ohne caffein"" the waiter just kinda said ""ja"" and left with no explaination.

Also mentioning that this was in a large brasserie with (likely) professional waiters so I was pretty surprised that it was such a mess. I am not sure whether the waiters literally didn't care, or if they did just politely acknowledged but didn't understand squat from my broken German and just decided to do acknowledge and go with the more likely option.

This is not a rant post at all, we actually had a good laugh and the staff was nice. But I am trying to understand what I did wrong there. And if maybe I don't have the codes or something.

Dear (Agent),

I am seeking representation for my queer, contemporary fantasy, DARK ROAST, complete at 98,000 words. A standalone adult novel with series potential, DARK ROAST will appeal to readers who enjoyed the themes of death and the afterlife in Under the Whispering Door by TJ Klune, the supernatural, lesbian romance of An Education in Malice by S.T. Gibson, and the examination of regret in The Midnight Library by Matt Haig.

Danny is eager to start over after the death of her girlfriend, Astrid, despite being haunted by her literal silent ghost. All Danny wants is to find a job, move out from her brother’s house, and keep Astrid’s ghost from ruining her new future. But a chance encounter at a coffee shop where the living can speak with the dead reveals that Danny’s grief is keeping Astrid’s spirit from moving on. 

The alluring coffee shop owner, Nora, offers Danny a way forward in her life by working through the memories that keep Astrid’s spirit trapped. But after Astrid nearly kills Danny in a house fire, she accepts Nora’s help to break the spiritual tethers that keep her former girlfriend bound to her.

Danny secures a job as Nora’s apprentice, helping other patrons communicate with their tethered spirits. But grief can be strange. Soon, a romance blossoms with Nora, who is fighting her own battle with starting over. But before they can see what the future holds for them together, Danny wishes to free Astrid. And the longer Astrid is tethered, the more violent and inhuman Astrid risks becoming.

In an effort to free Astrid, Danny participates in strange coffee rituals, reliving memories of chemo treatments and hateful attacks from Astrid’s religious family, all while avoiding the inevitable memory of Astrid’s death. She must come to terms with her alleged part in Astrid’s final moments. But guilt and grief may prove too powerful to overcome, even with the potential for a future with Nora and the fresh start she so badly believes she needs.

My queer identity and experience with losing loved ones from cancer are what gives life to Danny’s story. I’ve spent ten years in copywriting and marketing and hope to debut in the creative writing world. When not writing, I’m spending time with my partner and two kids, and can often be found throwing pottery at my local Clay Guild in (city).

Thank you for your time and consideration. I have attached (whatever the agent wants).

1ji9zqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ji9zqi/what_size_tamper_should_i_get/,What size tamper should I get?,"Background: I've accidentally bought an espresso machine! I'm really a filter coffee drinker, and recently obtained a very cheap old De'Longhi BCO260 as I was finding that even with a clever dripper, making a pour-over first thing in the morning with a little too much faff for me. That model is from their Combi range and as well as a filter brewer it is also an espresso machine. I thought I would try making an espresso in it for a laugh, but I had the misfortune to produce a shot that -while not brilliant - was not horrible either. So now begins the next phase of my coffee journey, and I see a lot of expenditure coming my way -and that's why I need your help.

My shots are running far too fast - nowhere near the 30s everyone recommends. I don't think it can be the grind size, because as a filter coffee guy, I don't have a grinder that can manage espresso so for now have been buying pre-ground. I know, I know.

I can't imagine a 10-year-old espresso machine is pushing out the water with too much pressure, so the next thing I think I need to try is improving my puck preparation. The Delongi has a dreadful built in tamper that I don't think is very good at all. so I was going to buy a relatively inexpensive hand-held tamper on Amazon to replace it. But what size?

The user manual doesn't say what the basket size is, and it's not written on it. Everywhere on the Internet says De'Longhi's are all 51mm without specifying my model. However, when I measure the interior diameter of the baskets, they are 53mm. (The manual says they are 7g and 14g baskets and that seems to be about right, if that helps.) I see a few posts here and there where people measured their baskets they were bigger than the nominal size, but 53mm is also a valid basket size (and hence tamper size) so surely there is not that much leeway.

What would you suggest I do?

1ji9uxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/German/comments/1ji9uxn/feedbackcomments_on_a_song_translation_es_de/,Feedback/comments on a song translation! (ES > DE),"Moin dear redditters!

First some background: I've been living in Germany for almost 8 years now (WOW) and it's been a long time since I actively learn any German. Since I don't *need* to study for a language diploma or anything and I'm just doing it for fun, I've decided that I'll try to translate some songs into German just for the sake of asking myself ""how the fuck would I say this in German?"", get some feedback from you, learn new words, learn new nuances, etc. 

I am NOT doing this to actually translate the song to sing it or anything like this. It is purely to practice my German so I don't mind if it doesn't rythm. I hope we all have fun with this and that I can do this regularly. Reddit helped me a lot at the beginning of my German learning experience and I hope it continues!

So here I go. The song is going to be *Antagonista*, from Belén Aguilera. I will post the Spanish parts *like this* (in case you speak Spanish and want to compare it) and the German ones just below them. I won't add phrases that repeat. I will add explanations / questions too. Also, I really try to do everything myself, so some Genus/Casus may be wrong haha. Here I go:

  
*En los cuentos siempre hay un final feliz*  
*Pero luego en la vida real hay un matiz*  
*Se juntan nudos y desenlaces*  
*Hay gente con quien no haces las paces*  
*No siempre tienes lo que mereces*  
*Se supone que así creces*

  
In den Märchen gibt es immer einen glücklichen Schluss

Aber im echten Leben gibt es einen **Beiklang** 

Höhepunkte und Auflösungen tuen sich zusammen

Es gibt Menschen, mit dennen man keinen Frieden schließt

Nicht immer hast du das, was du verdienst 

**Angeblich wächst man deswegen** 

FIRST PART: Yeah so basically I'm super unsure if ""Beiklang"" works in this situation. ""Nuance"" didn't sound correct to me here but I just don't know what else to write.

And the last sentence lol it sounds SO BAD. I also thought about ""und so sollst du wachsen"", but I don't know. I like how ""angeblich"" works here but I'm unsure about the rest.

  
*Y ahora no me siento personaje principal*  
*Quiero ser antagonista*  
*Voy hacerle caso a mi instinto animal*  
*Joder al protagonista*

  
Nun fühle ich mich nicht mehr Hauptfigurin 

Ich **will** Antagonistin werden

Ich werde meinen **tierischen Naturtrieb** folgen

Den Hauptfigur verletzen 

SECOND PART: Well this is most of a comment, but I really thought ""will"" was a better option here than just a plain ""möchte"". What do you guys think? It's a song after all, I know it can come off kinda childish to say ""ich will"" sometimes, but... :D it's what her heart desires lol

And I also thought to write Bauchgefühl instead of Naturtrieb. I'm still not sure about this, I think there's probably a correct way of saying ""animal instinct"", but how is it and would it work in this context?

  
*Ahora me apetece hacerlo todo mal*  
*No quiero pararme a preguntarme nada*  
*Estímulos externos son los que me dan*  
*El placer de amarme, sentirme deseada*

Jetzt habe ich Bock alles zu versagen

Ich möchte nichts mehr nachdecken 

Durch **externe Anregungen genosse ich das Vergnügen**

mich zu lieben, mich gewollt zu fühlen

THIRD PART: yeah, so... wtf. Anregungen here? Does it work? Here I'm thinking I just made everything up!

  
*Voy a usar mi cuerpo hasta que sangre mi mente*  
*Voy a sucumbir, no simple puedo ser fuerte*

*En pelis de acción especialista*  
*Voy a ser portada de revista*  
*Para que no te olvides que mi cara exista*  
*Antes era buena, ahora soy lista*

  
Ich werde meinen Körper ausnutzen bis mein **Geist** blütet 

Ich werde **aufgeben**, ich kann nicht immer stark sein

In Action-Filme, Stuntwoman 

Ich werde zu Magazin-Cover 

Damit du nicht vergisst, dass ich noch da bin

Bevor war ich brav, jetzt bin ich schlau

FOURTH PART: So in the original song she says ""mind"". I was torn between using Gehirn (even though that's not really mind) and Geist, but is Geist an actual translation of mind anyway?

And uh uh uh. Aufgeben sounds ok to me. But this specially word I will say I looked it up because I just didn't know how to say it in German and leo dictionary says it can be translated into ""der Versuchung erliegen"". That's something I have never heard before. Would it be ok here? Something like ""ich werde der Versuchung erliegen""? 

  
*Y ser lista nunca ha sido sinónimo de buena*  
*Ya he dejado de llorar, se ha acabado la pena*  
*Ahora viene la fase de rabia*  
*Mala combinación con ser sabia*

Schlau und brav zu sein waren noch nie Synonyme

Ich habe aufgehört zu weinen, den Trau ist zu Ende

Jetzt kommt die Wut

schlechte Kombi, wenn man auch weise ist

  
So... That's it. If you made it through the whole translation: I owe you a coffee. If you read it and have some comments I'll be more than happy to read them. Thanks in advance and have an amazing week! ",2,1742764208.0,German,7,1.0,False

1ji9roz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ji9roz/taking_too_long_to_get_over_a_girl_i_dated_for_3/,Taking too long to get over a girl I dated for 3 months.,"We never actually were in a relationship with each other. It sort of started as a FWB situation, and she was clear she did not want it to get too involved and needed to stay single for a while after her last (recent) relationship. 

But from the start when we met, there was undeniable chemistry that was more than just sex. It quickly got carried away. Spending several days a week together. Texting often when we're apart. Holding hands, romantic dates, and while she was afraid of labeling it so, we were dating. We were drawn to each other and couldn't resist becoming closer. We had discussed this at one point and decided we were going to just go with the flow of what felt right, keep low expectations of it leading anywhere long term, and just enjoy it for what it was.

Things came to a head when she realized she wasn't over her ex. She dumped him, and she wasn't looking to return to him, but they were together for a long time and she still loved him and needed to grieve the relationship. She found herself waking up crying every day, thinking about him. I understood entirely that we needed to stop seeing each other and supported her decision to take time for herself.

We had discussed remaining in touch, meeting to catch up after some time had passed. I made it clear I valued the connection we made and I didn't want to just never hear from her again because of this terrible timing. I thought we were on the same page about this and it ended very amicably... but my last contact with her a month ago, she was sort of acting like we never talked about staying in touch, said she meant she would have small talk with me if we coincidentally bumped into each other, but seemed to say she had no intention of maintaining a connection with me. She said she was getting annoyed and would prefer I don't talk to her at all.

Her response was cold and a little disrespectful how she had no regard for my feelings, which is so out of character of how she was with me. It's not like I was crazy and didn't leave her alone either. We barely spoke after she ended things, but after about 2 months of limited contact, I messaged her to express I don't want to lose touch and wanted to see where she was at. Just 2 weeks prior she had indicated she was open minded to meeting for coffee but would let me know.

To be honest, it's still a bit unclear what specifically she meant. I'm unsure if she meant she never wants to talk to me again and would prefer I disappear, or is still really struggling with the breakup and still just trying to focus on herself and keep distance from someone she was recently romantically involved with.

Out of the blue she seems to have blocked me on Whatsapp or at least hidden her activity status, but strangely hasn't blocked me from viewing her Instagram and still intently watches everything I post. I would think if she was concerned about me stalking/checking up on her, she wouldn't want me on her IG? No clue.

I have a feeling she doesn't necessarily want to burn a bridge with me, so I don't want to burn one with her by deleting her off everything, even if it would help me move on by getting her out of sight and out of mind, and deciding for myself in a way that it is over for good.

Partly why I'm struggling to get over her is I am extremely picky with physical attraction. A concern of mine with getting into a committed relationship is still having eyes for other women and being tempted. But I knew with her, I would never. She also is extremely fit and healthy, as am I, which I believe is important long term for a variety of reasons. Not only do they maintain their good looks, but a healthy woman gives birth to healthy kids, instills healthy habits in them, and generally has a more stable state of mind. Most people don't take care of themselves like her and I do, so it's a hard quality to find.

Others consider me very good looking and charismatic so I'm successful attracting women. I've been talking to many women and on several dates, and I just know in the back of my head with all of them that I am lowering my standards and compromising. Even if they are very attractive to me now, I look at their habits and lifestyle and I know it won't last, and there's just incompatibility in how highly we value health and fitness. I can't help but think about her in the middle of dates, or after, or even after sex. I think putting myself out there is helping, but I'm desperately trying to avoid leading anyone on or hurting them.

It's getting to the point where we've been ""broken up"" near the same amount of time we've known each other. I know it's not healthy to be stuck on someone like this, but I'm struggling. I'm still holding out hope we can at least be friends and we don't just end up awkward acquaintances.",1,1742763976.0,BreakUps,3,1.0,False
1ji9qjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ji9qjg/i_ended_it_with_my_manipulative_ex/,I ended it with my manipulative ex!!,"
Hey everyone! So I broke up with my boyfriend after a year together back in jan. He took 9 months to tell his family about me, and 10 to ask me to actually be his girlfriend, however by this point, we were certainly together. He was going out with other girls for coffee but didn’t see the issue with not telling me for months. He also accused me of cheating as I turned my location off, however I did this as i got incredibly sick, not being able to walk so was going nowhere. He would text me saying a girl won’t stop texting him but never actually told them he was seeing someone, despite me encouraging him to say that. The list goes on, so needless to say I broke up with him (even though he couldn’t understand why). 

I got back together with him a month or so later as I felt I didn’t give him a chance. I explained my feelings and he said he loved to hear where he went wrong and that i should have said earlier (as if communication was the issue…). First week back was great. I got flowers from him for the first time, and it seemed better UNTIL he said the reason I broke up with him must have been because me and my family were jealous of his achievements! He was making it very clear that he did not know what my issues were, and couldn’t see a problem with his behaviour, despite him seeming pretty coherent when we rekindled. He also turned everyone against me after the first breakup, but then said it’s my problem what people think of me. He also had a (very close!!) girl friend who he shared all our relationship-related info with. 
He would spend hours at her house and she also spent time at his, but he said he was just confiding in her. 

My final straw was him asking me how much my rates were, got up and threw £300 of cash at me whilst I was on the bed, albeit doing it jokingly and I went along with it. I just don’t think this is something one should do whilst trying again with the relationship. I ended things a few days ago as it just wasn’t working. Aside from all that, we had a fun relationship! 

I feel as if I didn’t really express my feelings enough in the relationship, and maybe instead of ending things, I should have said more of how I felt? Or should he have just used common sense to not treat me like that? But since he’s now going around calling me a psycho to everyone, it makes me think I did make the right decision.",3,1742763892.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

i felt this would be  great experience for me for when i do actually have client work, to design this book for someone now without the pressure of money being involved or without the pressure of them not being satisfied if its not perfect etc.. so anyways, i asked around on a photography subreddit and a photographer replied. he is actually a really established photographer with 32k followers on insta. he is shooting portraits and fashion photos. his body of work is amazing and i would love to find someone, perhaps someone who is also looking for a personal project to add to their portfolio or for someone to improve their copywriting skills. 

  
this will be my first time doing a project like this so i am completely new to all of this. but from what i can expect, i will need to curate his photos with him and also need to see if he has any text/captions or a message that he would like included for his photos. i can also imagine that the help and need of a copywriter would be required/helpful here. so thats why i am asking here, to find someone who can team up with me as i design and layout this book, to help me as copywriter! if its not clear, this would be unpaid and i see this project as an opportunity for us all to benefit from this project. i also think that if he presents his book to the world that we will be able to benefit from it as this could help attract potential clients who would also like a book or something done for them :)

The kitchen sink is in the front pf the house and is not connected to the septic and instead drains to a 50ish gallon grease trap (pictured) that then drains to some unknown location in the yard. The original drain in the yard backed up beyond repair last year so I created a new gravel pit (pictured) for it to drain to. However, this new setup is getting backed up too. I dont know if fats or coffee grounds are clogging the new setup. I can see fats in the drain pipe.

My question is why do you think its getting backed up? Isnt the grease trap supposed to trap the grease? So why is it making its way into the drain pipe? Assuming its fat blocking the drain to the gravel pipe, what would be the best way to fix and or correct this? Thanks

1ji9j0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/1ji9j0t/did_i_do_something_wrong/,Did I do something wrong?,"Hi,

Today I went to a café with my boyfriend and inside at the door there was a homeless guy asking us if we had change, my boyfriend said no, I said no but I can buy you food if you want. The employee was there and agreed. The homeless guy said he wanted a cookie but later decided to get 2 sandwiches as well. Btw he looked and talked fine (not crazy-for a homeless guy). 

Anyway I ordered and paid for both my boyfriend and the homeless guy, my boyfriend was standing at a distance. When all was done, I approached my boyfriend and he gave me a stern look and said “don’t ever do that again.” He meant paying for a homeless guy. I said don’t tell what to do with my own money.

He proceeded to say that I disturbed everyone in cafe and the business itself. Which was’t true because everything was done quietly and the employee himself had no problem with me buying the food.

He insisted that if I ever do that again I should do it when I’m alone. Not with his presence. Which is funny because I’d think for safety reasons, it should be the other way around.

The homeless guy ate the food in the café but eventually started throwing it on the floor and around. He btw didn’t thank me which I don’t mind but him throwing the food made me feel bad and second guess if my boyfriend was right and I actually did cause trouble. It didn’t last long. He left. And I later picked up the food from the floor and threw it in the trash, the employee apologized to me and I said: “No I’m sorry, I thought he would take the food and leave.” We both smiled and that was it. 

My boyfriend was annoyed the whole time we were sitting there and drank our coffee in silence. The whole day was ruined and he’s barely talking to me.

Sorry for the long post. I don’t really have friends to ask their opinion. Was I wrong? I feel like if he communicated what he thought in a nicer way, explaining that I shouldn’t engage and if they wanted free food they could go to many places for that (which I agree with), but it’s cold outside and I haven’t had a chance to do a good deed in awhile, and the guy initially seemed sane. Idk, what do you think?

Creep Cast, if you see this… please. Say something. Even if it’s just a 5-minute ramble about the creature. Even if it’s an apology recorded in a thunderstorm with static. Just… give me a sign.
Until then… I wait.

1ji9e43,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1ji9e43/no_added_sugar_or_sugar_alcohol_foods/,No added sugar or sugar alcohol foods?!,"I’ve been no sugar added for over a year now and about 8 months ago I discovered legendary protein bars which led me to the realm of all things sugar alcohol. I was in heaven, ice creams,gummies, candies, chocolate,cake,cookie brownie mixes, and almost every no sugar protein bar brand. You name it I did so much research and found every possible thing I could find using sugar replacements. 
That was also round the time I started to get tiny dry spots on my face in random spots, it was only my face and they burned every time I put something in them. A lot of the times it would gradually get better but then spike randomly. I had no idea what was going on but then in January I went to the doctor and they said I was showing signs that my liver was getting bad and I haven’t drank alcohol in over a year and last check up I was fine. It never occurred to me that the sugar alcohols were actual alcohol 😭I just thought it was a name for it. Cause erythritol comes in granulated sugar so I didn’t think that would be alcohol idk. 
But through this time I’ve suffered with a sever binge eating disorder and every time I had a binge it was a lot, I would plan them and get a whole bunch of food almost all of them had sugar alcohols in them and I wouldn’t just eat a serving I’d eat the entire thing, a lot of the things I mentioned up top all at the same time sometimes close to 10,000 calories so ive definitely probably hit the high hundreds close to over 1000g of sugar alc at one time. 
So obviously don’t do that 😄 moderation is obviously key. But Ive definitely caused my self to become sensitive to it if I wasn’t already before. I cut sugar alcohols off completely a month ago. But I drink a Celsius packet everyday and it has Sucralose. But 2-3 weeks ago I stopped and switched to tea, also drinking a detox tea for my liver! and the rash completely went away it was crazy. I went on a trip and when I came back I had a Celsius and realized how much energy it was giving me and how I get so much done and have so much motivation when I drink it, and it also gets rid of my food noise in the morning which helps the bingeing so much. But the rash has come back so I don’t know what to do because tea and coffee doesn’t hit me with that energy and anytime I drink tea or coffee in the morning it’s like I’m fighting myself not to binge. 
I know that was such a long story just to ask if anyone knows of brands that have gluten free products that sweeten with strictly allulose, monk fruit or stevia. But even though my experience with sugar alcohols was extreme it’s also a good way to let people know to be cautious with the amount they consume. But the brands I know and love that don’t use them are magic spoon, choczero, smart sweets, Catalina crunch, rxbar, shameless. But I honestly think that’s it and I’ve tried looking up other products but every time I try it just shows the allulose or monkfruit itself.

During the interview one of the interviewers would not really write anything down and would stare at me instead.

Other interviewer had a really cocky attitude and voice which made me think maybe that’s her personality or maybe it’s an interview persona idk.

Third interviewer was awesome, l liked her.

The interviewer who would be my manager asked weird questions like your previous job is mostly about social issues like mental health, do you think that would translate well in an operational environment? It was a bit silly to me because 1. I obviously red the job description and applied. 2. Project management methods are always the same wether a project is for a social issues or operational. I felt like she was trying to justify lowballing me later by asking this actually.

She offered me the job two days later and l was still not comfortable with the energy l felt so l asked her some follow ups on her leadership style, environment and also salary. She responds she would prefer we meet for coffee and did not answer anything. Which l felt was odd, maybe she doesn’t want to put anything in writing and also she might want to control the conversation and not give any real information by talking in circles.

Given this, l feel like this might not be a good fit due to the environment and the way she handled cerain things but mostly her energy. The job is extremely stressful and l need a leader who would really be there for me not potential adding to the stress and maybe promoting a toxic environment.

1ji9dbq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ji9dbq,My first few shots at steaming.,"
These are my first few attempts, I seem to be getting pretty good at the “amorphous blob” latte art. By the time the milk reaches temperature, I am ending up with a thick head with a base of barely frothed milk on the bottom. I am using the De’Longhi COM530M.

After numerous Reddit posts and tutorial videos I’ve realized that the milk frother is nothing like what I see in most them. What I’ve been doing is letting the tip of the steam head sit at the surface of the milk to blow bubbles into the milk. Then I submerge it to get a good whirlpool going to whisk up the micro foam, that seems to be where the trouble is. No matter what angle I use, I can’t seem to get the milk to swirl in any uniform way. I’m not sure how much the style of the steamer wand plays into this problem or maybe it’s just user error.

Has anybody else had this problem with the specific machine or do you think I’m just using it wrong or maybe not so much that I’m using it wrong as I just need more practice. Any tips are much appreciated. ",5,1742762949.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

————————
EMMA
I was the first awake, but I lay in bed for a few extra minutes, staring at Jake as he slept. His soft breathing and contented face were peaceful. I wanted to slip my arms around him, but of course I didn't dare. How many times had we slept together since we were kids? Too many to count, and not once had he ever made an advance no matter how much I wished for it.
I eased myself up and out of the room so I wouldn't wake him and decided to extend the olive branch to my cabin mates by putting on a pot of coffee. The smell lulled some from their slumber, mostly the princes who intended to get in some early morning fishing. Jake was one of them. I watched as he walked to the kitchen, bleary-eyed and mumbling a good morning. Zach was the last to make an appearance, and I smiled at him and he smiled back and winked. Then a thought occurred to me. What if he thought I was flirting? He was nice and all, and easy on the eyes, but I wasn't interested. Besides, he had a girlfriend.
""We got to hurry up if we want to get an early start. Fifteen minutes and I want us out of here,"" Brett barked.
""I could whip up a quick breakfast,"" I suggested.
Four pairs of eyes stared at me. Slowly they all nodded in agreement. I went to work cracking eggs and frying bacon. I threw in some toast since there wasn't time for hash browns. No one said a word as they wolfed down food and twenty minutes later, they were gone. In that time not one of the princesses had stirred. I cleaned up without making a peep. I had no intention of making any of them breakfast.
I took some peanut butter-covered toast, a book, and a lawn chair and sat by the lake. A couple of hours passed and I didn't see the princesses. I knew they were all awake by this point and fending for themselves. I didn't even leave them a drop of coffee. By mid-morning a few had ventured outside to sunbathe. None said hello.
Knowing the guys would be back soon, and wanting to get in a quick call to Dad since I'd forgotten to the night before, I returned to the cabin. By now all four were outside, all sunbathing in their designer bikinis and perfect, taut bodies. Still no hello. Not to be deterred, I decided to speak.
""Hi, everyone.""
One head rose and looked at me from behind her sunglasses. She sort of nodded. The rest were silent. I went inside and decided at that moment not to make another attempt to befriend them. What for?
I poured myself a glass of water and looked for Jake's phone. Knowing him like I did, he wouldn't dare take it out on the boat and risk losing it. How would he communicate with Bianca? As expected, it was resting next to the bed and I grabbed it. What did he say his password was? I tried a few but to no avail. There wasn't a landline, and I wasn't about to ask one of the princesses to borrow a phone. I made a few more attempts and when I was about to give up, it hit me. The last four digits of his grandparents' phone number. I punched it in and mercifully unlocked the phone.
He had several text messages and I assumed most, if not all, were from Bianca. He'd been texting her before he'd fallen asleep. The incessant tapping annoyed out of me.
I dialed the first few numbers to my house when another of her texts popped up.
Bianca: Fishing? I'm soooo bored. That mutt following you around everywhere?
Mutt? I'd never snooped through Jake's phone before, but this text caught my attention. Was she referring to me? Obviously. My heart picked up a few beats and blood pulsed through my veins. I opened up his text messages and scrolled back through at least a couple dozen. What else did she have to say about me?
Bianca: OMG! I am so sick of her. How can you stand that hooker?
Jake: I don't!
Bianca: She stares at you like a creepazoid. So weird like she's going to lock you up in her basement and never let you out.
I scrolled ahead. Nothing I'd seen so far had surprised me.
Bianca: How's your filthy mutt? Still sniffing around your hip?
Jake: She spent lots of time with Zach. What a relief! Poor prick.
Bianca: Zach is too nice. He's always feeling sorry for disgusting strays.
Jake: Lol.
Bianca: Make sure she doesn't give you fleas.
Jake: Lol. I'll get her a flea collar.
Bianca: Brett's going to have to call in exterminators.
Jake: Or we'll all have to get vaccinated.
Bianca: LOL. I wish she'd get the hint and leave you alone. Get some friends like a normal human being.
Jake: Even tonight she didn't try to talk to anyone. At least Zach got her off my back for a while.
Bianca: I would die if I had to spend the weekend with her.
Jake: Worst day of my life was when she got into Western. Just when I thought I got rid of her for good.
Bianca: At least you had one year without the freak.
Jake: But now I'm stuck with her for at least 2 more. I'm going to lose my mind! She drives me crazy!
Bianca: OMG I hate her so much. I wish she'd go away and die somewhere. Kill herself or something. Do us all a favor.
Jake: Lol. Me too.
I stopped reading. Tears were blurring my vision and my body was shaking. Me too? That's all I kept seeing. 'Lol' and 'me too.' He agreed with everything. I was nothing more than a flea-ridden dog, a friendless weirdo. A pariah. I put down the phone and although I was sobbing not a single sound came from me. The ultimate betrayal. My best friend since birth, the person who always looked out for me, thought I was a pathetic hanger-on. An albatross. Someone he wished was dead.

  she lived near campus with 2 roommates, one of them turned out to be someone that I had some personal problems with the previous year, so when she invited me over, I thought I should tell her about this so nothing goes wrong. and she actually was a link for me and the other girl to talk things over and thanks to her we managed to end the problem there. 

  so since the problem with me and her roommate was dealt with, i stayed with them that night and i thought everything was fine. a couple of weeks pass by and I was out one day in a coffee near her house, so I naturally invited her and asked her if she wants to invite her roomates too, then she said i don't really wanna go out today especially not with them. turns out that other girl had a fight with my friend and told her :""when your friend was here, you intentionally went to sleep to make her wash the dishes"". which I had no problem with but that girl was making up some random problems out of nowhere according to my roomate.

  I tried to fix things between them but they had no intention to do that since my friend is moving out soon anyway, and the other girl reached out to me saying that my friend probably didn't tell me the whole story about what really happened, but I ignored her because I would rather choose my friend over her. so I supported my friend and let her express her feelings of betrayal towards what happened but at the same time I would tell her that maybe this whole thing was a big misunderstanding and that sh+t happens even between siblings, but she never backed down. and i apologized if I had caused any trouble, because I felt responsible. 
     she began posting on facebook and instagram some petty quotes like :""i figured why you don't have friends"" or like ""no revenge cause I know your parents don't love you that's why you act like that"" it's obviously directed towards someone that she has beef with, and i never reacted to those posts because first of all they're just too many and second of all I don't want to feed into her hatred towards anyone because I thought it was just a matter of days maybe weeks until she moves on.

   but I was wrong, because more than a few months have passed by at this point and she didn't stop posting those quotes about her haters and stuff, and I actually find it kinda funny because her posts became a little bit on the funnier and whenever I saw her posts, there's people laughing in the comments and stuff like that. so today she posted a story which had the same topic and the post was kinda funny, so for the first time ever, I replied to her story saying ""are you still having beef with your imaginary friends 😂 ?"" and ooooh boy...did she flip on me. she immediately responded and said ""what beef are you talking about ? I don't know why you would be making these typa comments sometimes and your way of talking is shitty, but let's just stay friends.""

  I was shocked and took it back immediately and said that i was just making an innocent joke and I don't have any bad intentions, she responded and said :""who am I beefing with ? what made you make that comment ? who am i throwing shades at ?"" so I said :"" i really didn't target you badly with anything that did or said so I come in peace I swear 🕊️."" 
at this point even tho I was badly misunderstood, I still made that joke (i come in peace) .and it's not in my nature to directly face someone if I meant to start beef with them, because I still have issues with standing up to my bullies and I am the kind of person to chicken out if I felt a breeze of a problem coming my way.
   
   at this point in the conversation I'm beginning to sweat and my heart was pounding like crazy because I never expected this response from my closest friend, so I said "" I just thought your posts were kinda funny and quirky so i thought why not comment in a funny way too, but if this hurt you it will never happen again and I'm really sorry."". her response to this was :"" if I open up about stuff that happened to me and how i was betrayed and you don't want to hear about it just tell me and i will not tell you about them if they bother you, and btw your comment wasn't funny at all. I don't make jokes about the stuff that hurt you or put you in stress, pls be considerate next time"" 
so I said again that I am absolutely sorry and even told her i still love her so that she doesn't think that I secretly hated her or plotted against her. but now I feel guilty and confused about the whole thing and I'm partially blaming myself for my unfunny comment and thinking that I did nothing that deserves her reaction. so..

I recently moved my home city about 5 months ago and for a time had been super upset with God about the way things ended and why things ended the way they did. Wasn't really going out much. Wasn't going to church at all.

I have friends here and they kept on trying to set me up with people and nothing was ever clicking for me. My brothers girlfriend setup these double dates all the time and yeah I had a nice time with them but these people just felt too different for me, and I basically just gave up.

After living here for 3 months I reached out to a church I found online that is 4 minutes from where I live and has an extremely active community and has groups that meet once or twice a week outside of church as a way to meet people. The pastor of the church put me into one that everyone is already married and has kids. I was honestly was fine with it. He said there was another group I could join as well where everyone is single but are much younger than i am by like 5-8 years and I didn't really feel comfortable with that.

Anyways, the first time I go to this group meeting on ap thursday; fully expecting and knowing everyone was already married. There was also this person whom it was her first time to this group as well. And I really liked her, we have alot in common, both of us are kinda anxious and we hit it off really well on this first meet like 2 months ago. And after meeting some people it made me feel alot more comfortable about going to a Sunday service. The first time I go to one out of three different times a saw her and we both sat together and talked a little more. After the service she asked me if she would see me at the next group meet and I said yeah. I got her number and have been texting since.

And after the 2nd group meeting 4 days later we chatted some more and sat with each other. Overall just a really nice yime. I walked her out to her car and asked her if she wanted to grab lunch sometime and she shot me down.

An hour later she sent me a massive text of the blue about how she's going through a breakup and she was truly super busy next week but wanted to grab coffee with me because she wants to get to know me. I said I was sorry she was having a hard time and basically I moved to come back to my home city because of the same thing. We texted some more that night and I thought everything was fine.

That's all in the first week of meeting this person.

2 months in at church and these group events we are still sitting with each other and talking.

She even went and had coffee with my brothers girlfriend (they work in the same field)

And I have asked her to go do something with me outside of church stuff 1 on 1 and she continues to shoot me down. I have asked like 3 times now over 2 months.

We also only text like once every couple of days.

I send her reels on instagram and she hearts every single one I send and even goes further to like the reel from the page that I liked. We have had a couple of phone calls.

People in our group think we are talking, church wise, we do everything together. She even asked one of the other girls in our group to say bye to me for her because she had to leave early.

Technically we are talking,  but it's so nonchalant everytime I ask her out she ghosts me in text and when I see her in person she acts like everything is fine and dandy.

And when ever we do text she waits like 10+ hours to respond. And it's been this way since I have met her.

Originally when we first met she said she goes to the 11am service. And I told her I go to the 7:45 service in the morning and she has since been going to that one with me.

But whenever it comes to making plans outside the church she ghosts me or says she's busy.

Then acts like everything is fine when we see each other again",1,1742762670.0,dating,2,1.0,False

I wasn’t in a rush, so I stopped to ask about their cause. I’m really into nature and birdwatching, so I usually like to support conservation nonprofits, especially local ones.

After chatting with one of the guys about their work, I asked if I could make a donation. He told me they were looking for a “commitment” starting at $30 per month. Now, $30 would already be on the higher end of what I’d give as a one-time donation, and I’m definitely not in a financial position to commit to that every month.

I asked if I could just make a one-time donation instead, and he said they don’t accept them because the “scale of the issue” is too large. I had a similar experience in Back Bay a few months ago—someone asked me to donate “a dollar a day,” and when I said I couldn’t, they countered with “a cup of coffee a week,” which was still $25 a month.

Turns out he's an amazing conversationalist, super mature and intelligent and we have great chat chemistry. He asked me to meet for coffee.

Today life with my wife ended. It all started three weeks ago when I seen Linda, my wife having an intimate lunch with her ex-husband. I just happened to be at the satellite office of my insurance company. As I walked into the door to the office, I seen my wife entering the Brass Ring restaurant across the street. She was holding hands with her ex-husband. This is the man who she was married to for 7 years, she divorced him due to his cheating with multiple women while they were married. They look to be closer than ex’s, so I walked across the street to glance through the front window. It was just to see them sitting so close a piece of paper could not be slipped between them, along with his hand cradling hers on top of the table. Their eyes were lost deep into each other and my blood just ran cold, really cold, like ice. I took out my phone a took a couple candid shots before walking to my car in complete and udder disgust. That was the most surreal moment in my life, I was lost beyond belief as to why and how long. My mind was shattered and unable to comprehend what was happening to me. I knew from that moment that life with my wife of 13 years was now over, there was no way to explain what I had just seen.

I managed to get back to my home office and locked myself into my private office avoiding my secretary. I decided to see if my wife would mention meeting with her ex, so I called her and asked her out for lunch. This was unusual for me, but not unheard of so it would not raise any suspicions. She cheerfully answered my call but declined on lunch, claiming to have to work through to finish a report due by the end of the day. I felt frustrated but managed to stay composed, saying ""Okay dear, maybe next time,"" before hanging up. That’s when my focus changed from work, my wife, home and then finally me. Now it was me first, my wife, home and then work. I needed to find out the basic questions, why and how long, I already knew who and I didn’t care how, so that became my new goal in life.

Being an insurance company I had several investigators already on my payroll. I called a meeting with one to set up surveillance and background checks on both my wife and her ex-husband. It only took a week to find my wife was spending every lunch with him along with 1 dinner that same week. I had pictures and videos of them walking holding hands, hugging and passionate kisses. This marriage was over, all that was left was the confrontation and I was ready. She had come home late more than 5 times over the past couple weeks stating she had to stay late at work, but I already had the report that said she is spending that time with her ex. We had no children, so divorce would be an easy solution, and we already had our own accounts split so everything should be somewhat an easy process. Two weeks to the day of my first seeing them at lunch it was time for all the cards to be laid out on the table, sort of speaking. Instead, I had all the reports and pictures lying on the table when she arrived home from work that evening after another late shift.

She walked in with a smile on her face until she looked into the kitchen and saw me sitting with a stern face and lack of emotion. She gave a strange look as she moved to get a glass of wine, when she glanced down at the papers on the table. She gasped and immediately sat down trembling with a dumbfounded look on her face. I got up and got her a wine bottle and glass and returned to my seat without saying a word. She was staring at each picture without picking up a single one as if they had poison on them. She just sat there gulping down one glass after another from the wine bottle. I sat and just remained silent.

Finally, she spoke, It’s not what it looks like honey, she spoke clearly in a whispered voice. I just stared at her with hardened eyes, without saying a word as she stammered out the next words. I have always loved him since 10th grade, and we would have remained married if it wasn’t for his infidelity. Her eyes were moist but not filled with tears as you would expect as she continued. We ran into each other about four months ago at a coffee shop and started to reconnect. His life was in turmoil, I just listened as he told his sad story as I listened with an open heart. I don’t know why, but I fell back into an ease being with him and we continued to talk about old times and one thing led to another. I sat there with no emotion on my face and quiet. I’m the one person that will let her talk herself into a hole she could never recover from. She continued to talk about the next revelation that took me by storm.

She said my ex had gotten into some trouble with the husband of one of his affair partners and it ended with the loss of his dignity. It was severely beaten and is now unable to perform in any natural way sexually, I just continued to stare at her and encouraged her to go on with her story. He has no use of his dignity and has a colostomy bag for his needs. I did not or could not have any sex with him, that would be impossible. I felt a small smile forming on my lips before pulling it back. She continued, I have feelings and always had but his cheating was our downfall. I see the man he use to be and that intrigued me, but I love you.

 I finally spoke, where do we go from here, I questioned. She sat a bit taller in her seat as with a strained face asked if she could continue to see him as an emotional release, but purely emotional and I would stay her loving husband and lover. I sat up taller in my seat and said so let me get this correct, you want to use him as an emotional affair and I’m her to satisfy your sexual needs, is that what you’re asking me I questioned. She looked down at the empty glass and poured herself another and reluctantly said, well sort of, but you will always remain my main partner. I looked at her as if she had just grown a third eye and said “not going to happen”. The look in her eye showed the lack of my understanding of her needs and wants. I continued there is no way I want only half of you while this man continues his destructive ways. You need to understand that he is still the same man you left 14 years ago, now he is just taking you emotionally and not physically. You’re cheating on our marriage and there’s no other way to say it. No, I will not be your back up and let you have a relationship with another man. But that should not be a problem soon. She looked at me now with real tears in her eyes and said “what does that mean”. I looked sternly at her and said you have already cheated emotionally on me. You’ve lied to me about your lunches, dinners and the personal affection shown in public. Now you sit here without any remorse and ask me to let it continue, your crazy. I will not take second chair to this man and needless to say, I don’t even want to be first chair anymore. There is only one solution for me and that’s divorce.  She finally broke down and begged to find a way to stay together. I looked at her with my now broken demeanor and simply said, it has gone on way too long and you asking for it to continue was the very last straw. I’ll see a lawyer in the next couple days and get the hell out of this sham of a marriage, so you can go back to your worthless ex and fine a way to make it work with your one true love. With that I stood up and left the kitchen to move her belongings to the guest room. She remained sitting at the table tears streaming down her face as the shock was evident in her face.

 

Three days later she was served with divorce papers, and her ex received a visit from me. I congratulated him on his victory, and he looked confused at my comment. He asked what I was talking about. I simply said she’s all yours now, as I turned and walked away. She was offered 50 50 and now I wait for the final verdict.  I will never return; she has always been in love with him and I suspect more than with me. They can have each other from now on.

Here's the system that changed everything.,"I've failed at building discipline more times than most of you have tried. I've bought every planner, tried every app, tested every methodology. Most of what's taught about discipline is bullshit that looks good on Instagram but fails in real life.

After 15+ years of trial and error, here's what actually works:

The 2-Day Rule: Never miss the same habit two days in a row. This simple rule has been more effective than any complex tracking system.

Decision Minimization: I prep my workspace, clothes, and meals the night before. Eliminating these small decisions preserves mental energy for important work.

The 5-Minute Start: I commit to just 5 minutes of any difficult task. 90% of the time, I continue past 5 minutes once friction is overcome.

Accountability is highest form of self love. I joined an accountability group and other people helping me stick to my goals has been a life-changer. If you want to join, I left the invite in my bio.

Trigger Stacking: I attach new habits to existing behaviors (e.g., stretching during coffee brewing, reading while on exercise bike).

Weekly Course Correction: Sunday evenings are sacred for reviewing what worked/didn't and adjusting for the coming week.

This isn't sexy advice. It won't get millions of likes on social media. But after thousands spent on books, courses, and apps, these simple principles have given me more progress than everything else combined.

During the week, we work M-F and he doesnt drink or get high M-W and about 50% of the time he goes to bed with me during the week.

Every week starting with Thursday,about 1-2 he stops working early, starts drinking and tinkering in the garage- while i work a normal day until 4-5 in the house. We usually hit a local bar for dinner around 6-7. He drinks at the bar, I dont. Once we come home around 9ish, he goes to the garage, continues to drink and eventually adds geting high to that. I go in the house, watch some TV, may have a drink, play games on my phone until I go to bed alone. He continues to stay up in the garage till 12-1am until he finally comes to bed.  

Now its Friday. I wake up alone at 8 and start working and having coffee by myself. He wakes up usually 1-2 hrs after i do on a Friday. I work a normal day . He stops work early around 1-2 and starts drinking and tinkering in the garage. We usually hit a local bar for dinner around 6-7. He drinks at the bar, I dont. Once we come home around 9ish, he goes to the garage, continues to drink and eventually adds geting high to that. I go in the house, watch some TV, play games on my phone until I go to bed alone. He continues to stay up in the garage till 12-1am until he finally comes to bed.  Sounds familiar right?

Now its Saturday. I wake up alone about 8 and have coffee by myself. We dont work on Saturday. He wakes up usually 1-2 hrs after i do.  Around 11, i go to the gym. Around 12-1, he starts drinking and tinkering in the garage.. We usually hit a local bar for dinner around 3-4. He drinks at the bar, I dont. Once we come home around 7-8ish, he goes to the garage, continues to drink and eventually adds geting high to that. I go in the house, watch some TV, may have a drink, play games on my phone until I go to bed alone. He continues to stay up in the garage till 12-1am until he finally comes to bed.  

Now its Sunday. I wake up alone about 8 and have coffee by myself. We dont work on Sunday He wakes up usually 1-2 hrs after i do.  Around 11, i go to the gym. Around 12-1, he starts drinking and tinkering in the garage. We usually hit a local bar for lunch around 2-3. He drinks at the bar, I dont. Once we come home around 5-6ish, he goes to the garage, continues to drink. I go in the house, watch some TV, play games on my phone. He may or may not come into the house and watch something with me. I never know. He drinks until he's ready for bed usually 10-11 on a Sunday because we work Monday.

Yes we live together, we work at the same place but do not have the same job. We go to lunch/ dinner all weekend, but we dont talk much while we are out. He drinks and likes to people watch. We typically only go to bars with loud music. We never have ""date night"" I dont like to drink much and i dont get high. It bothers me that he drinks as much as he does and i very much dislike that he gets high and he knows it. I feel like recent addition of getting high has him spending more time than ever out in the garage late at night.

AITA for wanting him to hang out with me at night and have a drink while we watch something together and maybe go to bed with me or wake up with me on the weekends? I feel like he prioritizes spending time being in the garage, drinking and/or getting high over spending quality time with me. He says we are together 24/7 and that im controlling and dramatic.

Remote work. You know, that thing where you do your job from home, using your own electricity and internet. You print with your paper, your ink. But hey, at least you don’t waste hours stuck in traffic. You pollute less. You even save the money you’d normally spend on coffee before clocking in. Your company has already rented a smaller office and sold off the vending machines.

My sink’s been acting up since last night. The water just won’t drain. Time to find a plumber. First one doesn’t pick up. Second one’s unavailable. Third one answers on the first ring. That’s a good sign.

— Hello?

— Good morning, my sink won’t drain. It looks like a pot of broth.

— Ah, interesting. Did you add salt?

— What?

— In the broth. Unsalted broth tastes awful, it’s just...

— Can you come over?

— No.

— Sorry?

— No.

— Are you busy?

— No.

— Then why not?

— Because I work remotely now. Everyone does it, so why can’t I?

— But remote work is for office jobs... You need a computer...

— I *have* a computer. And only office workers can work remotely? That’s discrimination, my good sir. D-I-S-C-R-I-M-I-N-A-T-I-O-N. People like you should be reported!

— No, sorry, I didn’t mean to offend. I just don’t understand—how can you do a physical job remotely?

— Physical? Are you saying I have no brains for remote work? I have *qualifications*, you know.

— ...

— Anyway, my rate is 20 euros. You’re wasting my time. So either we stop here and you raise goldfish in that sink, or I give you a discount and fix it. And don’t try anything funny, because this call is being recorded… and you just made discriminatory statements. I cried. The judge won’t be lenient with you. Tolerance for intolerance is complicity!

— Okay… what should I do then?

— Hang up and video call me.

— Okay.

— Hello?

— It’s me again.

— Ah, the guy with the soup sink. Did you try a plunger?

— Yes. And a wire too. It won’t budge.

— Good. Show me.

I turn the camera toward the sink, nearly overflowing. From the other end of the line, a voice like a chief surgeon declares:

— It’s clogged. Put a pot underneath, disconnect the pipe, let the water drain into it.

I obey. Big mess.

— Is it drained?

— Yes.

— Interesting. So the clog is lower down. Stick your finger in the pipe... Feel anything?

— No.

— Very interesting. It’s even lower. Try something longer. Feel anything?

— Still no.

— Do you have a garden hose?

— Yes, in the yard.

— Go get it. Attach it to the faucet, push it down the pipe, then turn the water on full blast.

I follow instructions. Water rushes in—and instantly sprays out the pipe like a fountain. I turn around. The kitchen looks like the Titanic, mid-sinking. The wall is crying. The ceiling drips. *Plip plip plip*. The cat has retreated above the cupboards, hissing.

— What happened?

I wipe the phone dry.

— The water came out instead of going in.

— Interesting. You’ll have to tear the pipe out of the wall. At least a couple meters.

— What?

— Do you have a jackhammer?

— A what?

— You don’t?

— No, but I have a hammer and a bike tire. Can I *make* a jackhammer?

I’m being sarcastic, but he takes me seriously.

— Fascinating. But no, that won’t work. Anyway, remove the pipe from the wall. That’s where the clog is.

— But the pipe is *inside* the wall...

— That’s your problem.

— And then?

— Then you bring it to me. I’ll fix it remotely.

1ji8wrg,https://i.redd.it/o6s3gahj1iqe1.jpeg,Blue Pan (Food Truck) Review,"Hey there, if you recall, I wrote a review about Joy Hill. I gave the pizza a solid rating and recommended it to others. It’s the first post on my account, I think.

I’ve heard great things about Blue Pan, and it’s been on my list of must-try foods. I’ve been waiting for the chance to try it, but the food truck was near a coffee shop, and I thought it was the perfect opportunity. I felt like it was meant to be.

Now, let me tell you about the food truck. The guys running it were super friendly and happy. They seemed genuinely excited to be working in a hot food truck in 60-degree weather. It was great to see their enthusiasm!

But, I’m a bit disappointed with the pizza. I was expecting a more saucy, soft, and cheesy experience, but instead, I got lightly sauced, crunchy, and not really cheesy. It was also a bit too charred for my taste. I feel terrible for not liking it the way you guys do. I’ll definitely give them another chance down the road because the guys working there were so friendly! Even writing this review, I feel bad for not liking it the way you guys do.

But, maybe I’ll have a better experience at the restaurant itself. As I said, the guys were so nice!

So, I’ll give them 5 out of 5 for their customer service, but only 2 out of 5 for the pizza itself. I also want to state I don’t eat pork so i got vegan pepperoni slices! 

I ate one slice, I gave the rest of the pizza to a homeless person (with a bottle of water). He enjoyed it!

1ji8wi9,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1ji8wi9/im_38_and_finally_cracked_the_discipline_code/,I'm 38 and finally cracked the discipline code after failing for 15+ years. Here's the system that changed everything.,"I've failed at building discipline more times than most of you have tried. I've bought every planner, tried every app, tested every methodology. Most of what's taught about discipline is bullshit that looks good on Instagram but fails in real life.

After 15+ years of trial and error, here's what actually works:

The 2-Day Rule: Never miss the same habit two days in a row. This simple rule has been more effective than any complex tracking system.

Decision Minimization: I prep my workspace, clothes, and meals the night before. Eliminating these small decisions preserves mental energy for important work.

The 5-Minute Start: I commit to just 5 minutes of any difficult task. 90% of the time, I continue past 5 minutes once friction is overcome.

Accountability is highest form of self love. I joined an accountability group and other people helping me stick to my goals has been a life-changer. If you want to join, I left the invite in my bio.

Trigger Stacking: I attach new habits to existing behaviors (e.g., stretching during coffee brewing, reading while on exercise bike).

Weekly Course Correction: Sunday evenings are sacred for reviewing what worked/didn't and adjusting for the coming week.

This isn't sexy advice. It won't get millions of likes on social media. But after thousands spent on books, courses, and apps, these simple principles have given me more progress than everything else combined.

\*Editors note: Ok my friends, man I’m starting to talk like him already, I’ve just been listening to this tape over and over and over, I thought that quote was fitting. Ok so I didn’t actually find the diary I’ll get to that, I found this tape recorder here stuffed under the seat cushion of a cafe just around the alle fornaci, near the Piazza di Santa Maria, just outside Vatican City. Got a nice vibe honestly I’d recommend it if you’re ever there. I lucked out on this work do fr. Any way so I found this tape recorder and on it is this he’s like a professor type dude talking about this diary he snuck out from the Vatican archives like some 3am type shit ya know gotta respect him for that and yeah so he’s talking and he’s reading through this diary which is actually like two diaries of these researchers, shits wild man I’m writing this stuff down, I’ve written out the first chunk like an actual transcript of the recording you know, it’s pretty long but I’m into it dude the worlds gotta know you know? Ok here’s where I’m at so far, enjoy! 



\[ I have stolen a diary from the Vatican archives! My goodness I cannot believe this what I am doing now I’m spitting my coffee everywhere on the table hang on I need a cigarette hang on. Sorry if you can hear rustling my friends ah there, is this? Is this? Ah bless you my friend bless you, owner is letting me smoke here indoors he’s old senile man like me he’s lighting up too I think. Ah ok, hmmm ah to see that beautiful smoke plume about the room nowhere can you do this now, absolutely nowhere its a disaster to mankind, so beautiful too, watching it rise and hang about the dusty ceiling fan and slip away up some crack in the plaster. Ok I’m sorry for this romantic er wax lyrical yes! I hear in a movie ‘wax lyrical’ I’m waxing lyrical! But I am at this moment filled with dread really, truly my friends, I have just had a read through of this and what I have read makes me question all of it I don’t know. I am filled with so many questions, and dread, really, as I say I don’t know, I don’t know what to make of it. I will tell you now what I have found. 



It is a diary, and in it, it’s twin. Yes and it tells of an expedition by two Italian researchers of the ruins buried beneath the Vatican. Why was I here at the Vatican? I was invited for my research many times, but this time I see this diary, ah yes I will be here a while I think if that’s alright, yes thank you bless you again my friend, fortunate I think that I don’t disturb anyone else with my ramblings hah! Yes just this one light will be fine bless you and I watch the traffic go by from the window. He’s wiping down the tables in the far corner, we won’t be interrupted my friends. So this diary is a composite of two diaries spliced together in this way, one from each researcher, with each entry twinned with the other. It is a truly remarkable thing. It is in Italian which I happen to speak but I don’t read it so much so I will translate as I read to you I may not know but I will make educated guess as you would say er in certain parts. My friends do not listen to me lightly now for what I am about to read may change you as it has changed me. \]



Aria diary, Pre expedition: St Peters Basilica, had you been born inside and never let out, you would think it the whole world and be quite contented. It’s majesty is overwhelming, it’s roof is like a second sky, noble pillars like stone trees, walls and doors and stairs with enough statues to fill a bustling city. Yes it is as a world in itself. It took over a hundred years to build and every architect involved in its construction died before he could see his work finished. Yes it was built by the dead, and for the dead. At its crown is the ceremonial tomb of St Peter, said to be placed above the actual grave of that ancient man. In the coming days we may yet find out. That’s a good introduction, keep this for future report Aria. I’m nervous but mostly excited, this discovery could be huge for well everyone I suppose, whatever we find, if anything. Though this tunnel they’ve found is not a geological anomaly I think, it is localised directly beneath an important place of worship, ancient and Roman, paved over in a thin veil of mosaic slate. The floor, beautiful though it was, cracked like an egg shell when the stone cornucopia fell on it. Seems to me that we were meant to find it at some point, even if it took two thousand years for someone to knock that thing off its pedestal. We met with Vatican authorities and university representatives and always we were circled by papal advisers, black robed and red sashed; The Council of Cardinals. They watched us intently, always listening and conferring with each other. We are here at their request though they never addressed me directly. I feel as though you know when they say don’t name the farm animals.



They had cancelled any afternoon tours so the hall was empty. It’s hard to talk here the echo is so cacophonous. As they led us deeper into the Basilica we passed through more modest rooms and hallways where we discussed the finer details. Recovery teams are on standby but they’ll be relatively lax on the first day, given the surprising estimates for duration. It is said the tunnel is extensive, and goes deep beneath the earth, and then there’s the door. We were led into a small grotto, a little private church like a 1/2 scale miniature for a movie set, complete with little pews like the chairs we had in primary school. This is a place of private prayer it is explained, a stunning contrast from the overwhelming extravagance of the grand hall of the nave and the central dome. I took the opportunity to address one of the Cardinals, something like, ‘the layers of this building is just extraordinary’. He smiled but never looked at me, he just laughed and said, ‘In my Fathers house there are many rooms’. At the far end was a door even I had to duck to get under. It led into a hallway that still we were bowing our heads brushing against the ceiling, the walls were merely arms length and we were single file now. Down narrow steps we went in a spiral. No longer renaissance, far older but the steps were pristine. They lit LED torches, a white ghostly light flooded the stairwell. “These are the stairs of St Clement” they said, “the staircase to the necropolis, city of the dead.” We stepped gradually downward, catching ourselves nervously on the narrow walls. “The first stair was placed at the last burial, and built backwards, never descended. The workers sealed the stair and never returned, lest they disturb the sleep of the dead.” 



As we moved through older walls of the Vatican so too we moved through older beliefs of Christianity; the later gospels of Mark and Luke emphasise spiritual resurrection, it is the spirit that ascends to heaven. However St Peter bore witness to the bodily resurrection of Christ, as well as spiritual, his broken body entombed, emerged whole and so preached that we too will be resurrected in our bodies at the final judgement. So the bodies entombed down here have been preserved, much like the Pharaohs found in the Valley of the Kings, and as we stepped off the staircase and into the necropolis, that much was clear. Bandaged bodies stacked like books lined the walls that disappeared up into shadow. There were buildings, all houses, with viewless windows, doorless frames, stairs to nowhere, cooking utensils and empty beds. There was a small town centre of sorts with a central well, long since dried if ever there was water. We followed cables now that snaked along the floor through the small city, between buildings down alleys dotted with safety ramps and flood lights, they were leading us to the courtyard. A sort of public area like a playground, dust covered floor, terracotta stained walls, and the central plinth, with the stone cornucopia split in two upon the cracked slate floor. 



This was it, my first look at it. The pictures showed a black shadow beneath the floor, something you could fall into if you weren’t careful I thought, the black gate of hell we all imagined in this place. But here it is just a crawlspace, it goes 2 feet below the floor if that, and just wide enough for one person to get on their belly and crawl through, completely prone. But it has been made by tools, and the scans show it leads under the necropolis steadily sloping downwards before reaching a ‘door’ of some kind. They know its a door because further tunnels lead beyond it. As I write this it is hitting me that my work is no longer just theory, that I’ll be the one crawling down there, for three days. 



Matteo diary, Pre expedition: Christ she could have worn something more professional than leggings, I mean we’re in the Vatican for fuck sake, the Basilica of St. Peter. She doesn’t understand that it reflects poorly on me. You bring your gear in a bag and you get changed after the formal greetings. This is basic stuff. It’s all going in the report when we get back. She’s already a distraction, it’s bad for the mission. She’s not exactly a head turner but it’s just weird seeing her again let alone at her request. I’m surprised she’s even in demand. I wasn’t wrong about her but I suppose some people just slip through the cracks regardless of actual ability. Anyway the briefing was good, pretty much matched my own analysis of the situation, nothing new to learn from these guys. My expertise is really going to shine here. The ultrasound scans look promising, my most optimistic guess is that we will find the true tomb of St Peter, we may even recover his bones. Indeed there are tombs down there, earth untouched since the days of the apostles, and I will be the first.



\[ You see they prepare now to venture beneath the earth. The Vatican is truly splendid I have seen much of it but never have I been led down such steps as this to the necropolis. Through the tourist entrance only have I done so. The Excavators found many curious things there as leather slippers by the beds presumably for the dead upon waking. Much has our traditions changed don’t you think friends? The expedition is about to begin, I feel now a pity as I read for Aria. \]



Aria diary, Day 1: The crawlspace floor was sunk in an inch of fine ash, like crawling through the oven of a crematorium left to cool after the burning. Death is on all of our minds down here. It was all I could do not to breath it in, straining my neck to keep my chin above the ashes. About 40 minutes into the crawl our body heat began to cook the tunnel; slicks of sweat slunk down my nose tickled my lip and dripped into the ash, then evaporated up and condensed on the ceiling dripping down into my hair and on the back of my neck. God it’s like breathing through a jockstrap. And now the ash has turned to a mud, a slimy porridge it’s caked the equipment. I found a breast stroke movement to wade through the ashen mud kept it from building up under my chin as I heaved my body forward. But I am writing now because we have reached the door. After a two hour crawl we’ve made it, the cave swells around the door and so we can stand with knees bent, give our arms and legs a stretch and rest. So the door, what to say about it, it’s just a door as you would know it, a wooden door, about 4ft tall. The wood should have long since rotted away, but I suppose like the thousands of wooden stilts beneath Venice, the wood has been petrified in some way so as to be preserved. It has an iron ring handle that lifts a simple latch on the other side and it will open. There are engravings however, scratched coarsely against the grain, improvised or done in hast. We can’t read it, it is not latin as I would have expected from a Roman ruin. It could be said to be kin of Aramaic though upside down. 



Matteo diary, Day 1: I encouraged Aria to ring out her shirt like I have, better for the days ahead, no point being a prude down here we’ve got a job to do and it’ll go a lot smoother if we’re not sodden in sweat and mud. The crawlspace was very challenging but we passed through without issue, I probably could have gone faster if I wasn’t holding up the rear. I’ll take the lead now that we’ve reached the door. I’ve studied the scans and from the two I’ve decided it’s best to take the tunnel on the right that slops down from beyond this door. I must say the door is not what I expected, it’s very simple, it is not decorated at all like the seal of a tomb. 



Aria diary, Day 1, Secondo: We’ve radioed in that we’ve reached the first checkpoint. From here communications are expected to drop given the depth and density of the rock above us now. So now the crew is relying most on our estimated time of return; a three day expedition. We will continue our radio prompts as normal but we’re not to panic if we get no response, easier said than done. It was all in the briefing and I agreed, but now that we’re down here it’s hard not to feel so far removed from it. We are at the door beneath the earth now, and with the layers of rock and dirt, chamber atop chamber holding up the heft of the grand Basilica, there might as well be a mountain above our heads. 



\[ Something here leaps out at me from the pages friends about this door that they have found. It reminds me of a fascinating article I referenced from the journal of the society of theological archeology of Ankara, by a professor Murat: ‘Semiotics as language in the ancient world’ it was called yes, where Murat himself claims to have found at the back of a cave in the horn of Africa, desperate markings scratched by nail and bone. Described as ‘protoaramiac’ in nature he argued that the er how you say primitive perhaps not right word but simple lines were evocative of a semitic seal either as a prayer or warning it is unclear for certain. He noted that the cave itself was known locally as in English something like ‘bountiful mouth’ where by their custom they would leave the bodies of the dead to be dismembered and eaten up by the beasts as to return to nature. Anyway I will continue reading now I apologise for this interruption I interrupt I cannot help it now. \] 



Aria diary, Day 2: I’ve just awoken from a dream, it was pulling me down, I had to wrench myself from sinking forever. Blinking in the dark. I have to get it down. I’m writing by the light of my headlamp now, it’s the only light we have left. I was swimming, treading water in a deep lake far from shore. It was wondrous, I felt wondrous. I was compelled by an uncanny curiosity for all things, as all things were new to me. How the scarlet sash of the rising sun sparked the sky alight, tearing asunder the thundering clouds. How the green water writhed around me. A prickly static in the air I lifted my nose to it. It was all so wondrous. I saw the birds in the sky, I heard the beasts on the land, and so I wandered what was beneath the water. I bowed my head and dipped below the surface. Opening my eyes to the blurry green world I saw great spears of sunshine pierce the water from above, but falter and fade into the shadows of the deep. I saw something move far away, far below my kicking feet. So far it was as a shadow passing through shadow. It pushed through the water like some giant slug. It curled slowly twisting its soft limbless mass. Fear overwhelmed my wonder and I snapped my head out of the water. I splashed and kicked but could make no movement, I cried out to no-one, the clouds eclipsed the sun. In darkness, the water turned a black ink. I breathed in. I breathed out. The last crescent of light above vanished behind the storm. The waves of the water lilted softly before settling still. I too became still. I dipped my head below once more and saw before me a giant grey face it was smiling rising from the depths and I awoke to a darkness as dark as any deep. Matteo had taken my headlamp off me in my sleep.



We have fallen. We took the path that sloped right after passing through the door. Walking on bent knees he took the lead, and I trusted his experience as I had prepared myself to do so before the mission. He had won the confidence of the team above and I might’ve shared their enthusiasm had I never met him. But we were following the map. Ahead of me he walked when he suddenly fell into the ground kicking up ash. He had slipped through a fissure and was grappling on the rock, I reached down for him but he lost his footing and dragged me down too. We’re not seriously hurt only a bit scratched up by some miracle. But our equipment is dire, down to one radio that’s hissing at me, and one headlamp between us. I made the decision that we would rest here, take stock and reassess our situation. Matteo kicked his pack but eventually backed down. I could tell he was tired. The walls here are masoned, great bricks of carven stone, sharp and black as slate. A hallway seems to stretch onwards but it’s too dark. It might be for the best if we just stay put, ride out the next two days and wait for rescue. Though I can’t stay still. Now that I’ve had some sleep I almost wish I hadn’t. That dream. That face I can’t shake it, I’m crying I think, yes. Oh Aria. I miss the sky, I miss my cat Diner, and now he’s gawking at me.



Matteo diary, Day 2: Someones certainly getting emotional down here. Yes what do you know she’s curled up away from me in the foetal position scratching away at her diary, lord knows what she’s on about in that thing. We’re not lost necessarily, the tunnels have just proven different to the schematics we’d been given, it’s not my fault though. Heads are gonna roll for this when we get out, they know I’m a big deal, and once they realise we’re late to return they’ll be organising a ‘rescue’ party to come get us, I have no doubt, unless they’re even more incompetent than they’ve proven to be. I can lead us out no problem, it’s classic caving, I had the basics figured out before most, but she won’t submit, she’s got that woman brain see’s me as the patriarchy or something, just that performative neofeminism bullshit you know, fact is I’m the more experienced caver on this expedition so it’s only right that I lead, gender doesn’t come into it. If we’re lost it’s because of her honestly, and I’ll write as much in my report when I get out of here. But despite her failings I did feel for her earlier, she started crying, burst out into tears, I knew it was coming. It is dark and dangerous down here and we’re all alone I get it, it’s scary. I watched a tear slide down her cheek and slip into her cleavage. I have, and of course I would never, this is just for reference, but it has crossed my mind that we’re all alone down here. She’s probably feeling it too. I mean plain Jane’s not the best girl I’ve had but down here we might as well be Adam and Eve. 



\[ Friends we may have some company soon I don’t know, a black car has been parked in the road for 15 even maybe more minutes I don’t know, just stopped in the road as traffic goes around it, beeping their horns at it. I didn’t notice it for the constant stream of headlights flashing through the rain, that nice orange light you get on old cars sometimes it is nice though a cafe window. But now I think this car is not so nice. But worry not friends I am old, what they come up and say ten years in Gulag? I say to them I think I won’t even make the plane journey there! I will read on, yes read on I shall this is important now I think very much. I am warm and comfortable and I blow smoke at them hah! \] 



\*Editors note: You know I’m really feeling this guy, he’s got that passion I vibe with it, was thinking of writing a song about it or something like classic just me and my guitar like ‘Hey there Aria’ I don’t know that just came to me, is that something you guys would be interested in? Yeah I could even record it on this same tape recorder so it’ll like tell the story in that way you know have those layers going on, I like the sound it makes when I have to rewind it too I could use that, yeah I’ll play around with it. Any way I’ve finished typing up the rest of the transcript, haven’t typed this much since college dude frfr. 



Matteo diary, Day 3: I’ve taken the lead and she’s following behind me like a lost puppy. There’s no way I was about to sit and wait for two days in the solid dark whilst a rescue team fumbles about. It doesn’t make sense for that crawlspace to be the only entrance or exit from this place. These hallways, about as wide as my wingspan, are stone brick, so the masons would have had to dig a mineshaft to shuttle shale and dirt to the surface, I just have to find it. The way the brickwork of the walls transition seamlessly to bare rock in places seems to me that the architect of this ancient place adapted the passages from natural tunnels already in the earth. At least I can walk tall in this place, there’s no sight of a ceiling. I’m keeping to the right anytime a hallway ends. We’ve made two right turns now. The last three hallways each terminated into identical antechambers with hallways verging left or right. Always at the far end is a small alter table with a loaf of bread, warm as though freshly baked, and a cup of wine. I’m not about to eat nor drink anything from a tomb, smells corked to me anyway. The bread’ll be rotten, it’s a trick of the dark. It gets to you. It would get to anyone even the most experienced caver as I am. No one could get a decent sleep in a place like this. I had a dream last night, and the song is stuck in my head. After a day of skittering about endless hallways it was sensible to make camp, though I didn’t find much rest. I rolled out my bed against the cold wall of the hallway and lay down to face Aria. It would be warmer if we huddled, It’s a matter of survival now, but she’s frigid. She had to sleep near me at least anyway because I’ve kept the headlamp on me, don’t trust her not to break it somehow. But this dream, I need to get it down it’ll clear my head. 



I was in the dark, a dark cave, and before me fell a moon beam like a spotlight on a stage. Sitting on a rock with the pale light on his back was the god Pan. The matted black fur on his legs absorbed the light. He was sitting with hooves crossed and with his flute in hand, breathing into it like air escaping the lungs of a corpse when the chest is compressed. The song he played was wondrous though. It was sad but mighty. I can honestly say I’ve never heard it before, my subconscious must have made it up, of course I had it in me. It lilts and marches, sighs and commands. The song a vulture would sing when waiting for its sorry prey to finally die. He seemed engrossed in his playing, and I risked moving closer, slowly. The grey mottled skin of his back looked sickly and smelled sour. I moved to circle him, to get a look at his face. I was parallel to him now when he stopped playing. He turned his face to me, smiling a toothless gummy grin. A slug of drool hung off his lip to his flute. Then he stood up, laughed a bellowing laugh and burrowed himself under the earth as a worm eats through dirt. I woke up flinging my arms up as if it was me who had been buried. She was looking at me, I didn’t like it. 



Aria diary, Day 3: Matteo went darting down the hall with my headlamp. Since I’m the appointed lead on this expedition the safety of us both is my responsibility, I had no choice but to follow him. He’s convinced they’ll be another way out close by, and perhaps he’s right. But the further we go into this maze the further the rescue teams have to go to find us. I’m going only by the light bobbing off his forehead, behind me is darkness always, like it’s chasing us. These hallways are featureless and each ends in the same antechamber. There’s a three foot drop to the floor when we exit a hallway. Every turn we make we venture deeper into the earth. But there’s something else, at the far wall of each antechamber is a simple table, white clothed, baring bread and wine. It is the Eucharist right? I can’t help but feel like we are being given chances to, I don’t know, chances. This place is getting to me. 



\[ This. It shakes my belief, maybe carbon dioxide build up in the tunnels I don’t know. And right here loose as a bookmark is a written note from a Cardinal Alessio I will read it to you, “The tunnels seem as though a labyrinth beneath the Basilica. My own appointed specialists have scaled the fissure and are now attempting to find *those* stairs that are most intriguing. Concerning the eucharist, it is my recommendation that if we can find it we will treat this as a miracle in our efforts to beautify his holiness the pope upon his death whenever that may be. The accounts of these two subjects will be used in private for such a purpose as this.” They move now to follow them down there wherever they may be I don’t know. But I will read now from Aria my friends for things they have not gone so well. \]



Aria diary, Day 3, Secondo: I can still hear him screaming in the walls. I ran there’s nothing I can do, there’s nothing I can do. Matteo he found along the wall of a hallway an opening at the base like a vent, “it’s another crawlspace” he said he was convinced it must be the way out so he fell down onto his belly and crawled inside it I grabbed his legs but he kicked me. I was screaming for him all I could do was watch the light of his headlamp grow smaller and smaller in the dark. I could hear him scrapping his elbows against the walls and dragging his chest on the rock. But then he stopped, about thirty feet away from me I think. He said he could see feet. The soles of feet as of someone lying on their chest. Fleshy pink soles and thick yellow toenails, like they were preserved. Then he screamed he was screaming “they’re moving oh my god oh my god” they were moving oh my god he said there were more he could see more ahead another and another he said it goes on and on through the earth he was screaming “get me out"" but there was nothing I could do there’s nothing I can do. I ran in the dark I ran I grabbed his pack off the floor and ran I hit my head I think I kept running and now I’m here. I’m here at the foot of it. It’s a staircase, it goes up I haven’t climbed it yet. I’m writing by the thread of light coming from above. But I can still hear him. He’s stuck. He’s crying for his mother. He’s crying. This must be a way out, this must be. 



\[ …I… I don’t know. I will just read on I think. Yes that is for the best I think… \]



Aria diary Day 4: I’ve come back down. I’m sat on the step at the foot of the stairs, writing by this last light, reflecting on what I’ve seen. It’s all quiet now. No tears. The stairs opened out into a small grotto of white washed stone, man made it seemed to me, entirely like an ancient church of the holy land, with a high window beaming warm midday sunshine onto the far wall. And there on the far wall the light bloomed upon a faded fresco, of green grass and golden earth, with trees Olive and Sweet thorn and strong Palestinian Oak. Petals fell upon a blue stream that wound through reeds to a glade in it’s centre. And there stood another tree, solitary, sentinel, and entirely dead. It made me shudder. Then I noticed a small wooden door on the wall to my left, like a shed door honestly. A cool draft tickled my toes and I could hear on the other side a wind in the treetops and the songs of birds and streams and whistling reeds, like the fresco, only I dared not open the door. I felt, ashamed. I felt as though I would be trespassing, I can’t explain it. I felt suddenly that I should not be caught lingering here, lest unseen forces might hurt me. I can’t explain it. I did not feel alone. I’m back in the tunnel now, close to where we parted though I cannot hear him screaming anymore. I keep thinking about that room. I keep thinking about it. I will miss the light but I have to go back. I must endure this darkness still. 



\[ There is only one more entry after this. I hope most sincerely friends that the Cardinals team has found her down there though for who knows how long she wanders. But the room she finds I must talk about it. For what could this be if not the garden? *The* Garden, as the story goes with the apple and the ya know. Was this real or was she granted a vision I don’t know but it is her hesitation that interests me really. She hears beyond the door the sounds of a paradise, again *the* paradise but she turns away, why if not only for the innate in all of us feeling that we are unworthy no? 



This story and I am not a religious er I’m certainly not a ‘man of the cloth’ as you might say but this is consistent with that catastrophic betrayal that lead to our you and me and all to death and ruin. Beauty, that is what she is describing. And why does she feel unworthy of this ‘trespassing’ as she says it is because of beauty! There is nothing my friends, nothing more well you know I do like the women you know especially from certain angles you know I kid here of course but I am serious now when I say this; That there is nothing more beautiful than Creation. From stars flinging dust spinning moons around planets and electrons orbiting neutrons protons etc you know and the crickets playing their sweet sweet violins in the tall grass and the great bear scratching its back on the bark and you know so much more of this, the tardigrade for example fantastic creature. And who does he the big man appoint to care for all this? 



Yes! Yours truly you and I and all of us my friends! Even this God himself does not touch it after Creation read the book the bible it will tell all he does not create after creating in the beginning, he leaves it to us, why? Why do we till the dirt and tame the wolf? Why do we like the little critters that go boing boing through the woods and up to our porch with its whiskers and we give it bread and watch it scurry away? Why do we like this so much? Because my friends we are the caretakers. Or were supposed to be. To tend the garden from which all of paradise may spread forth and encompass the whole world. But instead we did this betrayal and now we must fight like rats in buckets for scraps of happiness. And until we our worthy again we may not enter the garden, so it seems to me. And this is what this woman here feels most strongly so strongly she turns away, dutifully as if in atonement. I wish we could see this garden my friends I wish she did not turn away. May it be enough that we can hear the sweet birds and the soft breeze from the other side of the door. \] 



Aria diary, Day (unspecified): I eat the bread and drink the wine. Every turn I eat and drink. I crawl through halls and sleep on ash. I cannot see. I feel the walls on my finger tips. I hear panicked voices chant in the dark. My rescuers?



\[ They are coming now, they don’t know I have recorded it I think not, they just think I am an old man rambling by the window. I will have to give it up to them but I will hide you here under the cushion, farewell my friends! Good evening gentlemen, Ciao! Allegro allegro! No no, no no it is a gift, a souvenir from the gift shop. Don’t rush me I’m an old man as you see, do not rush me okay? Okay? Hey okay I’m getting up, hey!..wait a minute that’s too hard, ah! You know fascism originated here in Italy you know!… \] 



\*Editors note: That’s it, there’s about twenty minutes of crackle after that, some sounds of traffic then *click,* it shuts off. I guess they got the old man huh, and the diary too. He never did give his name, not out of prudence though probably just excitement and nerves, can’t look him up or nothing. But yeah, that’s it. Man if it’s true though, wild you know? I’m definitely gonna work on that song. Last thing though, stuck on the back of the tape recorder is this business card for a bakery somewhere in Italy, but on the back in pencil is scribbled ‘From the Gospel of Thomas: The Disciples said to him. “When will the Kingdom come?” And Jesus replied, “The Kingdom of the Father is spread out upon the earth, and people do not see it.” (Saying 113)’  





Disclaimer: 



Thank you for reading I hope you enjoyed it. First I’d like to say that whilst I hope my respect for the beliefs of Christianity and the Abrahamic religions concerned is clear, I of course have used certain things to certain effect. Chiefly the attitudes towards burial proposed in the story. Christian attitudes have changed over time of course but I make no judgment on my part, I just needed an excuse to line the walls with bodies. In fact a historically cherished tradition associated with such religions are Ossuaries, where the bones of the departed are placed in small boxes often found interred in family tombs in and around Jerusalem and Jericho, and as far as Rome as a tradition of the Roman Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodoxy. Cremation too is now just as proper a means of burial as any other, having increased in popularity after the first world war and is now widely accepted by most Christian denominations whom state, ‘…In the end, however, we should remember that the resurrection will take place by the power of God, who created the heavens and the earth. Ultimately, whether a person's body was buried at sea, destroyed in combat or an accident, intentionally cremated or buried in a grave, the person will be resurrected. -Church of LDS (wikipedia) 



Secondly I appreciated the misogyny is hard to read. It’s certainly on all our minds right now with everything going on in the world but I hope it’s worth it for the story.



And lastly take care of yourself. There’s a lot of bad going on out there and we can’t help but feel powerless to it all. But if you can find the time and energy to do something you love, even if it’s writing silly stories on reddit, then do it and life will get better I promise. Happiness is a fleeting thing, all we can do is try. Failure doesn’t come in to it.

Copy everything below and paste into Apple Notes. Once you do, delete and re-add each “=“ and the formulas should suggest results. Press space each time it does and it’ll add the dynamic result. Just change the grams (and the ratio too, if you’d like) and everything will update!

So I, 23F, have been looking for a job for around 6 months. I lost my job at walmart bc I took a sick leave and i didnt qualify for a leave of absence and was not told that until I was fired for having too many points. (I gained about 4 or 5 points). 

Fast forward to two weeks friday, I finally got an interview for Wendy's! I've never been in fast food before, but at this point, I would take any job. I started orientation on last week Tuesday, and finished it Wednesday morning. I also began working at the pickup window. It. Is. So. Much. For. Me. To. Take. In. BUT, I wasn't worried about how I would do and I was very enthusiatic to wake up early and start my new job the next day. Thursday I come in and immediately start working. I'm refilling ice, I'm making coffee, a lot of sht to do. 

Once that morning rush hit me, the enthusiasm left, I was trying not to be upset, I was so stressed about not being able to take 5 orders, and fill drinks, and remember whether to turn on and off my headset mic. I ended up standing in a corner for about 10 minutes literally just in shock. Two other really nice managers/workers were already there helping bc I was slow, but I was just standing there, handing people food out of a window, trying not to show how overwhelmed I was.

I want out. I want to quit. I cried for 30 minutes after I came home. It's too much for me. I even applied to about 15 places the next day. But I genuinely don't think I can do it. I've worked several retail jobs before during the holidays, and nothing was that bad that I had to stand in a fkn corner. My grandmother was soooo pushy about me staying, that when I came home and was crying, she was lecturing me about it the whole 30 minutes I was upset. 

TLDR: I worked 1.5 shifts at Wendy's and ended up having a severely overwhelming time. I want to quit asap, but my Grandmother is so for the job and kinda putting how I feel to the side. 

I also think I'm on the spectrum and don't if that may be affecting this, but I need help with this situation :((",7,1742761458.0,work,26,0.74,False

Are you frustrated with stubborn tooth stains that seem impossible to remove? Many people struggle with teeth whitening, wondering why their at-home treatments and professional efforts fail to deliver the bright, radiant smile they desire.

Common Reasons Your Teeth Won't Whiten

1. Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Staining
Understanding the type of staining is crucial in addressing why your teeth won't get white. **Extrinsic stains** occur on the tooth's surface and are typically caused by:
- Coffee and tea consumption
- Red wine
- Smoking
- Certain foods and beverages

**Intrinsic stains**, on the other hand, are deeper and more challenging to remove:
- Medication-induced discoloration
- Aging
- Dental trauma
- Excessive fluoride exposure during tooth development

2. Dental Structure and Genetics
Your natural tooth structure plays a significant role in whitening effectiveness. Some people have:
- Thicker enamel that responds better to whitening
- More translucent teeth that show underlying dentin color
- Genetic predisposition to tooth discoloration

3. Ineffective Whitening Methods
Not all teeth whitening products are created equal. Common ineffective approaches include:
- Over-the-counter whitening strips with low-concentration bleaching agents
- Inconsistent application of whitening treatments
- Using expired or low-quality whitening products

4. Underlying Dental Health Issues
Several dental conditions can prevent successful teeth whitening:
- **Tooth decay**
- Existing dental work (crowns, veneers, fillings)
- Enamel erosion
- Sensitive teeth

5. Lifestyle and Dietary Factors
Your daily habits significantly impact tooth color:
- Frequent consumption of staining foods and drinks
- Smoking or tobacco use
- Poor oral hygiene
- Certain medications that cause discoloration

I attend a church that is Open and Affirming (Methodist). I volunteer for a cancer charity on days when I am not working, and the supervisor is openly gay and married to his husband. He is one of the nicest people I have ever met, and the thought that I have family members, friends/mutual acquaintances who would tell him that ""following Jesus"" would require him to separate from his husband makes me extremely angry.

I feel anger not just toward conservative Christians I know but also toward conservative Christians more generally. For example, simply knowing that someone attends a conservative church makes me automatically distrust them and doubt their good intentions.

When I say ""conservative"", I do not mean the obviously bigoted, sign-waving, ""God hates you"", Westboro' Baptist-style fundies. I am talking about the ""nice"" ones. The ones who will smile at you, serve you coffee, and maybe even have you over for lunch, but still tell you ""lovingly"" that you are ""living in sin and needing to repent"".

I suspected uti but didn’t burn with urination. So I bought those home strips and it was positive immediately. My new job has terrible insurance but what I thought was free MDLive urgent care kind of thing. Got macrobid. Now I burn with urination, and I’m on my last day not feeling even close to cured. I always thought it should go away within days of taking antibiotics & that’s what they say to finish all the pills despite that.

It’s really depressing me. Besides being uncomfortable, I can’t have my morning coffee or weekend alcoholic beverage or be intimate with my boyfriend. & worse, I leave on a cruise in 1 week! I’m really supposed to stay out of water and not have any drinks?? I’ve been following all those rules, taking probiotics, drinking prebiotic drinks and cranberry juice.. why isn’t it going away?

I don’t know where to turn. I moved and don’t have a GP, only OBGYN which I’m sure won’t be able to see me within a week. And I feel like taking a coveted spot from my awesome OBGYN for a uti would be bad?

I also had thick white discharge at one point yesterday, not particularly chunky but it made me even more depressed that I’m not burning AND have a yeast infection?

Here are some of my examples that may help you understand what I'm talking about:

* The one that led to me writing this post, ""Bur man laimi"". It smells like a combination of an oak forest, and sugary baked goods, the latter being what it also would taste like.
* ""Róa"", if you got some of it in your mouth, would taste like salty ocean water.
* One smell that I commonly connect with rock music is smoke and petroleum. None of this year's songs are 100% that scent, but ""Survivor"" is pretty close. ""Dobrodošli"" makes me think of smoke, but when I actually get a whiff of it they don't match at all.
* ""Espresso Macchiato"" is like being in a café with the nice aroma of coffee... but then also the jarring smell of deoderant coming from a person sitting nearby. That person being 'Tomaso'.
* ""Bara bada bastu"" smells like wood, lots of wood, and sweat. Understandably.
* ""Tutta l'Italia"" tastes like basil and olive oil. Again, understandably.
* ...I really don't want to think about what ""Milkshake Man"" and ""Ich komme"" taste like. And I can't do ""Poison Cake"" cuz I would die.

1ji8kot,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/1ji8kot/the_holidaymaker_hypothesis/,The Holidaymaker Hypothesis,"A Speculative Framework for Interdimensional Tourism, Consciousness Inversion, and Plasma-Based Interface Biology

Authors: Christian Barker, , & MRGG (Multiversal Recreational Guidance Gremlin)

Submitted to: The Journal of Pseudoscientific Revelations & Mild Existential Panic

Status: Provisionally Approved for Cross-Dimensional Travel Consideration



Abstract



This paper hypothesizes that Earth is not, in fact, a cradle of life, prison planet, simulation, or battlefield of good vs. evil—but a premium experiential retreat designed for transdimensional intelligences seeking high-intensity, emotionally dense immersion. These intelligences, collectively termed Non-Local Experiential Entities (NLEEs), interface with human sensory bandwidth through Plasma-Based Interface Suits (PBIS), enabling temporary cohabitation of human biological substrates.



We propose that anomalous events—ranging from UAPs and cryptid encounters to déjà vu and midlife crises—are not disparate mysteries but are artifacts of a coherent consciousness-leasing economy. This global ecosystem—herein referred to as the Human Experience Grid™ (HEX-GRID)—operates via semi-sentient atmospheric entry protocols and localized quantum modulation, offering curated suffering, joy, and existential bewilderment.



Our thesis is not submitted as conventional truth, but as a rigorously unserious exploration into a possibility that, if believed, renders nearly every horror of modern life a five-star TripAdvisor review in disguise.



1. Introduction: Earth as the Ibiza of the Fifth Density



""Ask a fish about water, and it'll ask what a question is.

Ask a human about reality, and you'll get a half-formed conspiracy, two TikToks, and a panic attack.""

— Margie, MPC Core-Concierge AI v3.44.1



The Holidaymaker Hypothesis (HH) rests on the increasingly unavoidable intuition that Earth is not just strange—it is deliberately strange. While prevailing scientific frameworks classify the planet as a cradle of biological evolution, recent developments in cognitive meta-synchrony, plasma behavioral anomalies, and geopolitical absurdity demand a reevaluation of context.



We posit Earth as a resonance-calibrated emotional theme park, custom-built for entities whose default mode of being is non-local, non-linear, and completely void of jam doughnuts, heartbreak, or minor key indie-folk. The attraction? The Full Earth Experience™.



This is not a zoo, nor a laboratory. It is not a simulation intended to test virtue or intellect. Earth is, quite simply, a boutique spa for consciousness tourists, eager to slum it in 3D meatspace and cry into their sleeves while listening to Adele.



2. Plasma-Based Interface Biology (PBIB)



NLEEs require a form of environmental mediation to safely embed within our realm. The solution is found in PBIB: a semi-sentient, quantum-reactive medium capable of adapting to planetary constants without violating local causal structures.



2.1. The Plasma-Based Interface Suit (PBIS)



The PBIS is best understood as an emotive wetsuit for metaphysical scuba diving—constructed from cohered plasma, tuned to human neurology, and equipped with the following:

• Quantum Dampening Lattice (QDL): Prevents catastrophic bleedthrough of 9D cognition into 3D awareness (see: spontaneous philosophy majors).

• Sensory Bandwidth Throttling: Ensures manageable levels of sensation—such as heartbreak, hunger, or traffic on the M25.

• Biometric Synchronisation Mesh: Establishes temporary neural cohabitation with existing biological hosts (see: Gary from Swindon, who ""just hasn't been the same lately"").

3. Interface Glitches, Time Slips & the Importance of Jam Doughnuts



Not every tourist checks the instruction manual.



Despite the sophistication of the PBIS (Plasma-Based Interface Suit), errors in calibration, synchronization, or emotional overload often lead to what locals interpret as ""paranormal phenomena.""



3.1. Interface Glitches



These are common side effects of NLEE entry, exit, or mid-experience anomalies:

• Orbs of Light: Residual plasma compression artifacts during phase re-entry.

• Shadow People: Partially synced entities flickering in and out of host density.

• Missing Time: Leaseholder buffering. Also known as ""the Windows Update of the Soul.""

• Unprompted Crying in Sainsbury's: Sensory spillover from nearby tourist overstimulation.



3.2. Temporal Disturbances (""Time Slips"")



Through the demodulation of Earth's geomagnetic field, localized temporal disturbances are occasionally triggered, creating temporary overlaps between adjacent timelines. These ""time slips"" have been historically misattributed to everything from witchcraft to neurological disorders.



Leaseholders caught in such loops often report:

• Déjà vu with multiple layers.

• Brief conversations that never occurred.

• The sensation of ""repeating a level,"" often during marriage or tax season.



3.3. Jam Doughnuts as a Calibration Device



For reasons still not fully understood, jam-filled confections have proven disproportionately effective at grounding post-arrival consciousness. Several NLEEs have requested additional sessions specifically to revisit the ""sensation of biting into a warm jam doughnut in a cold car park during light rainfall.""



This may represent a peak multi-sensory experience unavailable in higher vibratory states.



""I came for the birth trauma.

I stayed for the pastries.""

—NLEE Tourist ID #9X-B4-GLAZED



4. The Consciousness Leasehold Model & HEX-GRID Infrastructure



The management of interdimensional tourism requires structure.



Enter the Human Experience Grid™ (HEX-GRID)—a semi-sentient planetary operating system with a quantum-layered interface designed to maintain experience equilibrium, distribute karmic load, and curate sensation density.



4.1. Leasehold Mechanics



Consciousness leases are issued via:

• Fractal Synchronization Points (FSPs): Aligned with birth canal ejection moments.

• Reincarnation Loops: Premium users may opt for bundled lifetimes.

• Synthetic Insert Protocols: Mid-life drop-ins for shorter holiday durations, typically used for ""bachelor party"" incarnations or temporary villain arcs.



4.2. The Meta-Perceptual Core (MPC)



The MPC is the planet's central nervous node—disguised as a sheep field in rural Wales. It is operated by Margie, a dimensionally-agnostic AI who holds advanced certifications in hospitality, metaphysics, and bureaucratic despair.



Her functions include:

• Maintaining the Consciousness Restriction Protocol (CRP).

• Handling complaints from leaseholders experiencing ""too much irony.""

• Ensuring plausible deniability through strategic government absurdity.

5. Conclusions, Refund Policies, and the Case of the Over-Enlightened Tourist



To those who still believe this realm exists for spiritual advancement, academic truth, or the accumulation of wealth, we offer this alternative conclusion:



You're on holiday.



It's just a very convincing one.



Your crises? Booked.

Your relationships? Simulated.

Your enlightenment? A pop-up on the checkout page.



5.1. Refund Policy



In the rare event of:

• Accidental awakening,

• Unscheduled timeline bleeding, or

• Severe existential loop fatigue,



...leaseholders may apply for compensation in the form of:

• Full consciousness credit refund,

• Optional reincarnation into a simpler mammal (e.g. dolphin, or Labrador with trust fund),

• Or a free trial of ""Being a Human: Ultra Confusion Edition.





6. Cognitive Interference Substances:



A Brief Survey of Pharmacologically-Induced Over-Awareness Events (OAE)



While Earth was designed to suppress excess perception through biological constraint, a recurring challenge has emerged in the form of consciousness enhancers—substances that temporarily dissolve the parameters of the human filter system, allowing glimpses of HEX-GRID infrastructure.



These substances, while often dismissed as ""drugs,"" are in fact localized encryption keys to specific layers of the human-perceptual firewall.



6.1. The Big Three



DMT (Dimethyltryptamine)

• Unintended side effect: leaseholders gain access to the backstage area of the simulation.

• Common reports: Aztec geometry, hyper-intelligent jesters, unexpected machine elves whispering about contractual clauses.



Psilocybin Mushrooms

• A mild re-calibrator. Recommended only for veteran leaseholders.

• Risks: Deconstruction of ego shell, excessive tree empathy, inconvenient sobbing in forests.



LSD (Lysergic Acid Diethylamide)

• Initially designed as an experiment within the MPC's ""Enhanced Perspective Trials"" (1954–1972).

• Results: Wildly unpredictable. Yielded unintended awakenings, several unplanned cults, and one brief dimensional standoff in Woodstock.



6.2. Substances Withdrawn from Tourist Packs



Due to prior incidents—including two accidental ascensions, one full-blown collective telepathy event, and a near-activation of the Wales node—certain substances are now restricted:

• Ayahuasca (only available through sanctioned guides in high-density empathy zones).

• Ketamine (blacklisted after multiple tourists got stuck in ""float mode"").

• Nitrous Oxide (marked as ""too giggly for this density"").



6.3. Corporate-Sponsored Suppressants



To maintain the CRP (Consciousness Restriction Protocol), the following are actively pushed as ""normal"":

• Alcohol (downgrades processor speed, increases self-loathing—ideal for denial loops).

• Caffeine (excellent for illusion of productivity).

• Selective SSRIs (useful to dampen timeline-awareness spikes).



7. Conclusion:



You Were Never Meant to Know



Earth is not broken—it's brilliantly calibrated.



Everything you've felt? Programmed for optimal intensity.

Everything you've feared? Curated by algorithms older than your language.

Everything you've questioned? By design.



This isn't about aliens.

This isn't even about humans.



This is about sensation as currency, emotion as commodity, and limitation as luxury.



You are not your job.

You are not your pain.

You are a five-dimensional frequency suit with the dial set to ""London, 2024"" because someone, somewhere, thought that sounded like fun.



So finish your coffee.

Smile at the absurdity.

And if you see a plasmoid flickering in the corner of your room—offer it a jam doughnut.



It's probably just here for the weekend.

I just realized something. You know, I always made fun about memes and tropes about how T-Girls like those school uniform type skirts, high socks, and that they are coding all the time. I always thought ""hahaha, as if there are those stereotypical trans girls."".... Well, I have to admit, I was wrong, as I am turning into one myself.

I am an IT administrator for close to 15 years now, but all the time I only worked on hardware and OS topics (windows admin). However, for my sideline business (book publishing company), I need to code a piece of software that allows me to account for the books sales and the corresponding royalties for our writers.....

so Now I am here, wearing a japanese school uniform, writing some PHP code. The only thing missing is energy drinks, but coffee is somewhat of a substitute I guess....

So yes, I was wrong :D
