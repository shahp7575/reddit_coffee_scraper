Overthinking tuloy if he lost interest or should I cancel? 

Context: I have a coffee meetup with this guy sa friday. Before we set the coffee, medyo nagllike pa ng stories and nag ccompliment sa stories ko. Then nung na-set na yung coffee, bigla tumahimik? Nag vview pa naman ng stories. Pero nag ooverthink lang ba ako? 

He's the one who chose the cafe, planned logistics para di ako mahirapan mag park. May night shift sya ng 10pm that same day, pero he's willing to wake up early, at magkita kami 6pm para kitain ako at di kami nagmamadali. G rin daw to treat me dinner sa DTF before he goes to work. 

Nagtaka lang ako bakit wala ng usap usap sa social media after. We're both pa-trentahan na. I'm 27F and he's 29M. 

I confirmed nung sunday if tuloy kami, sabi nya tuloy naman. Nabusy lang sa work. Pero see you this friday daw. 

Napapaisip tuloy ako if icancel ko or what? Help an overthinker please! ",1,1768313863.0,adviceph,1,1.0,False

Hello there! How are you? I hope you always have a nice, warm meal and never go hungry. I had a rough day at work today. A taxpayer yelled at me because his payment was delayed! It didn’t go through since it was paid via GCash. He kept lashing out, asking why he should suffer if he had complied, and saying that the person before me told him it was his fault, even though it wasn’t.

I tried to explain what happened and what he needed to do, but he was too blinded by frustration for me to get through to him. I was very scared; probably a little frustrated too. My boss noticed and helped me resolve the case, and I was finally able to breathe. My day sucked, but I hope yours didn’t.

Anyway, as I was walking home earlier, I noticed a trailer playing for Bar Boys: After School. I remembered a scene that was posted on their official page but wasn’t included in the movie. Jazz talked about her relationship with Torran, saying that before they were together, they were already good friends, so they loved each other even before they officially became a couple. The gist was something like that.

It made me wonder: what would our love story look like? How would we first meet? How would our first date be? and the ones after? What would our first fight be like, and how would we make up? It sounds exciting, doesn’t it? Imagine having coffee on a slow morning while talking about our day, or simply sitting beside each other in silence. I bet it would feel fluffy, warm, and cozy…probably like home? I can’t wait to spend mundane days with you.

Love,
Your Future Wife


P.S. When I finally get that “dot” in my name, would you mind if I used your last name instead?

1qbseq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/FearfulAvoidants/comments/1qbseq8/clarity_on_fa_struggles/,Clarity on FA Struggles,"Hey everyone - Sorry for the long post - 

I got broken up with by my FA ex 7 months ago. I am still processing the breakup and would like to understand FA attachment better in order to put all the fragmented pieces together and to close our chapter in a peaceful way. 

I know everyone is different, but if some of this resonates with you, could you please give me some insight into your emotional world when this happens? So that I can understand better. I am still mourning the loss of her and some days I feel like I want to reach out someday, because I believe what we had in each other was so rare, but my hands are tied because the last thing I want is to create anxiety for her. 

 First let me give you insight about our relationship - I am 41 and she’s 39, when we met she really pushed the connection, she wanted to be exclusive, I met her parents quite early on (her family loved me and I still have all of them on socials) she asked me to move in with her, she also pushed for us to get engaged and we got engaged after 4 months together, we were engaged and living together for 3 years before she blindsided me with a breakup 7 months ago. She struggles with FA attachment and also has Bipolar disorder, which complicated things.

She is very self aware when she is regulated. We would both always be open to gently have hard conversations and repair. She always said that I am rare and I am worth fighting for. That she won’t go down with this ship of fear and anxiety. She would jokingly say that she is supposed to be mysterious and complicated and now she just feels needy and vulnerable.

 She also told me that she loses sight of me, that she constantly thinks that she is being manipulated or lied to. ( I don’t know how much of that is BP or FA) . When she was triggered I asked her what are her underlying beliefs about me and she told me that she believes she can’t trust me, that I don’t really love her and that I am just using her. She told me that she is scared of an intimate relationship and as soon as we moved in together her anxiety started spiking. She said that she loves me so much and her worst fear is waking up from the storm in her mind to find that I have left and only then will she realise what she had lost. And maybe she deserves it.

About two weeks before she broke up with me, I suggested to book her 2 nights at a retreat for the weekend, where she could go and just have some alone time, read, journal, enjoy her own company, have a massage etc. We are both homebodies and we regulate when we are on our own. She then messaged me and asked if I wanted to leave her, is that why I suggested that she go away for the weekend and said that she is so sorry that she stopped fighting for us and it is okay if I want to give up but she wants to fights for us and still believes in us.

I was so confused and responded that I am not going anywhere, I love her and I just wanted her to rest and have some time for herself. She cried when she read my response because she thought I was breaking up with her? She would always tell me throughout our relationship that she understands if I want to leave, if her trauma is too much etc. She would go cold and distant for weeks and be really triggered by me but she would never want to talk about her triggers and give me an opportunity to work through them with her. She also never discussed them in therapy. She always said that no one else would have stayed through all the wounds and healing like I did and I told her that she is a beautiful soul and anyone who sees her worth would stay through the hard stuff. She’s worthy of healthy love. She would resent herself and she would start crying telling me that she’s hurting me by withdrawing and she hates it and that she constantly thinks I am lying to her and now she realises how awful that must feel to me.

 I never resented her for anything, and I always reassured her. I was accepting that this is her capacity at the moment and we needed to put in the work to move through this although it is hard for us both. I told her that I just needed a map, I had no idea how to navigate through the woods of her mind, but I was more than willing to do it with her, I just needed the tools. I still resent myself, if I just knew more about attachment styles or encouraged her to see a better therapist, what if I was too affectionate? But when I gave her space she would get anxious and tell me that it hurts her when we don’t feel connected. I was at a loss. I am very open, warm, playful and affectionate, but I am also someone who enjoys alone time and doing my own thing.

On the day that she broke up with me she made an appointment for couples therapy in the morning and she broke up with me that afternoon. I was broken, first she asked for a break and I told her that I don’t understand how we are going to take a break as an engaged couple? Then she said that we have to break up then and that we can still live together because we are still two people who love each other. She said that I am better off without her and I should give it a year. She said that if it is really love, we will end up back together and that love gave her the strength to end us. She said that I healed a big part of her and that she doesn’t regret the relationship. Then she turned cold, casually went for coffee with a friend, gave me a pat on the back, and suggested I go to therapy after this. She didn’t cry at all meanwhile I was having panic attacks.

When I packed my bag and called an Uber that night she started sobbing saying “I can’t see”. That was the last day I saw her and my puppy. 

After that she messaged me saying that she is confused and she can’t tell me why she is breaking up with me  yet, because a lot was at play, but she just feels like it has to happen and she has been unhappy for a long time. She said that she needs to heal and work on herself and she is not proud of how she showed up in our relationship, that she felt like she was causing my anxiety and she was the reason I was struggling with auto immune flare ups. Which was not true. She told me I had a beautiful soul and I healed a big part of her and she doesn’t regret the relationship. Right after that she kicked me out of our shared home and business, took our dog, spoke to me in ways that dehumanised me, blocked me on WhatsApp even though I was respecting her NC request, rebounded back to an old ex right after leaving me and broke up with him after 2 months, she always told me how she was not really attracted to him and they only dated briefly before she met me. When she left me I told her that I am heartbroken but I respect her decision to break up and I just want her to be happy. I never chased. I went through the pain alone and remained gentle and caring but boundaried. She blocked me on instagram but kept me on her hobby account, which I then unfollowed for my own sanity.

Anyway, my friend told me she recently posted a poem to her IG story dedicated to her past loves - if they had beautiful souls they should be assured that she loves them still, she lights a candle for them and through the distance and mistakes she hopes to embrace them again one day. I am the only past love apart from the rebound ex which she still has contact with.

I don’t know if she misses me or thinks about me. I guess that is just to soothe herself and maybe manage her image amongst friends.  I still want to reach out one day, but at the moment it makes me anxious, it’s more out of care than a hope to rekindle, although I would be open to a relationship when some more time has passed and we both did some work to be better equipped. How would you feel if an ex reached out a year after you broke up with them?  Did she plan to leave me way before she did or can the urge be sudden? ",1,1768313682.0,FearfulAvoidants,0,1.0,False
1qbsedp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qbsedp,Newish Kitten Randomly Peeing on Bed,"Need some advice. TL;DR version: one of our kittens has peed on our bed 4x and we don't know what to do.

We got a bonded pair of kittens (Penelope & Pearl; Pearl is the grey cat) in mid-Dec '25. About a week after getting them used to a smaller room (with their litter box, toys, playtime), we opened up our bedroom to them. Zero accidents in the smaller room.

A few hours after being in the bedroom, Pearl peed on the bed. We picked her up, put her in the litter box, got the duvet cover and duvet washed with enzyme cleaner, picked it up from the laundromat, put it back on the bed, and Pearl peed on it again a few hours later. Different spot. Also, neither the flat sheet or fitted sheet was affected by her accident either time. Put her back in the litter box, got the duvet cover and duvet washed with enzyme cleaner, but didn't use them again. That was about 3 weeks ago. We revoked access to our bedroom for a few days, monitored her, and she was using the litter box as normal.

Reopened access to the bedroom, replaced the duvet with a thicker blanket (blanket is a darker red with a pattern, it's in the 2nd photo). Approximately 2.5 weeks of usage, zero issues. Or so we thought. Yesterday we changed the sheets and we found an all-dried-up, small pee stain on one corner of the bed. It seeped through down to the flat sheet and the fitted sheet (but not the mattress cover or mattress). Also, no smell. Which is odd because I figured if a cat peed on our bed and we didn't see it right away, we would have smelled it. I sprayed the flat sheet, fitted sheet, and mattress cover with enzyme cleaner. Washed the sheets. Haven't put the thick blanket on the bed again yet (we need to get it professionally cleaned). I'm just not sure when during the past week and a half that this incident occurred (we normally change sheets every week but were lazy and it has been two weeks since we changed the sheets, and we had been using the red blanket for 2.5 weeks).

We received a waterproof blanket yesterday that we were originally going to put on our sofa downstairs (for when we open up the downstairs to them), but since we just found the dried pee stain yesterday, we figured we'd try it on the bed first. So we put the new waterproof blanket on the bed yesterday early-evening. At first the girls barely noticed it, but once we got into bed, they both got in with us. They both slept peacefully throughout the night, on top of the new waterproof blanket, zero issues. But this morning (like, an hour ago), my GF was getting ready for work, and Pearl looked her dead-ass in the face and peed on the bed again.

So what's the deal? Is she marking territory? Is there something else we're not seeing/doing correctly? These are our first cats and neither of us are really sure what to do. As of now (about an hour after this morning's incident), I revoked access to the bedroom (I WFH some they're normally with me in the home-office room all day, anyway). But just prior to that, I had come back upstairs after making coffee and Pearl was just there, layin' on the bed, like nothing happened (3rd pic).",4,1768313660.0,cats,0,1.0,False

**RULES FOR TAKING CARE OF A PET SAE**  
 *(low-maintenance, high-standards, emotionally constipated)*



**rule one:** respect his autonomy. your pet sae does not like being hovered over, micromanaged, or “managed” at all.

**rule two:** do not mistake quiet for contentment. silence is his default setting, not a status update.

**rule three:** provide structure, not supervision. schedules are appreciated; interference is not.

**rule four:** give him space to work uninterrupted. breaking his focus is a personal offense.

**rule five:** keep emotional conversations concise. long, messy talks will be shut down immediately.

**rule six:** quality over quantity in everything—food, praise, company, attention.

**rule seven:** do not praise excessively. one sincere acknowledgment is enough for the month.

**rule eight:** he prefers competence to kindness. be useful, not comforting.

**rule nine:** make sure he has access to controlled competition. it keeps him sharp and sane.

**rule ten:** avoid forcing socialization. he tolerates people selectively.

**rule eleven:** he does best around people who are confident and grounded. insecurity irritates him.

**rule twelve:** do not argue emotionally. if you disagree, do it logically or not at all.

**rule thirteen:** privacy is non-negotiable. do not go through his belongings, messages, or thoughts.

**rule fourteen:** allow him to retreat without guilt. withdrawing is how he resets.

**rule fifteen:** keep his environment clean and intentional. clutter is distracting.

**rule sixteen:** do not assume detachment means apathy. he feels deeply—he just doesn’t advertise it.

**rule seventeen:** set boundaries clearly and once. repeating yourself is unnecessary.

**rule eighteen:** if paired near a pet shidou, supervision is required. sae is calming but not indestructible.

**rule nineteen:** let him choose when to engage emotionally. pushing will backfire.

**rule twenty:** understand that loyalty from sae is quiet, consistent, and earned over time.



**FINAL NOTE:**  
 a pet sae is not demanding—but he is exacting.

treat him with respect, competence, and restraint,  
 and he will remain stable, sharp, and unwavering.

disrespect his boundaries,  
 and he will simply stop engaging with you altogether.

  


**WARNING SIGNS TO WATCH FOR IN A PET SAE**  
 *(quiet does not mean fine — pay attention)*



# EARLY WARNING SIGNS (SUBTLE BUT IMPORTANT)

these are easy to miss if you’re not observant.

* becoming noticeably quieter than usual  
* shorter, clipped responses  
* avoiding shared spaces without explanation  
* increased isolation beyond his normal preference  
* irritation at small inefficiencies  
* working longer than necessary with no breaks  
* subtle tension in posture (jaw, shoulders, hands)  

these mean he’s starting to disengage.



# MID-LEVEL WARNING SIGNS (INTERVENE GENTLY)

at this point, something is actively wrong.

* visible frustration masked by calm  
* dismissive or cutting remarks (more than usual)  
* refusal to participate in structured routines  
* impatience with people he normally tolerates  
* shutting down conversations abruptly  
* losing interest in competition or refinement  
* hyper-fixating on perfection  

this is emotional overload, not arrogance.



# HIGH-RISK WARNING SIGNS (DO NOT IGNORE)

these are rare — and serious.

* complete emotional withdrawal  
* icy politeness instead of blunt honesty  
* avoidance of all interaction, even necessary ones  
* reckless decision-making masked as “logic”  
* intense fixation on a single goal to the exclusion of everything else  
* refusing food, rest, or recovery  
* sharp verbal lash-outs without provocation  

this means he’s suppressing rather than regulating.



# CRITICAL RED FLAG

the most dangerous sign with a pet sae:

* **he stops caring about outcomes**  

this means burnout, detachment, or internal collapse.



# WHAT NOT TO DO WHEN YOU SEE WARNING SIGNS

* do not confront emotionally  
* do not demand explanations  
* do not crowd him  
* do not guilt him for withdrawing  
* do not involve others without consent  

these will push him further inward.



# WHAT DOES HELP

* restore structure  
* reduce external pressure  
* offer practical support  
* give space without abandonment  
* check in briefly and factually  



# FINAL NOTE

a pet sae does not explode.  
 he erodes quietly.

if you notice the change early, you can stabilize him.  
 if you wait until he’s gone cold,  
 he may already be unreachable.

**watch for the quiet shifts — that’s where the truth is.**

  


**WHAT TO DO IF SOMEONE ELSE’S PET SHIDOU BONDS TO YOUR PET SAE**  
 **(OR YOUR PET SAE BONDS TO THEIR PET SHIDOU)**  
 ***(this is delicate. proceed with caution.)***



# FIRST: ACKNOWLEDGE THE BOND WITHOUT PANICKING

this bond is:

* rare  
* intense  
* mutual (even if sae pretends otherwise)  

denying it or trying to “break” it will backfire immediately.

this is not a crush.  
 this is a functional, high-voltage attachment.



# STEP ONE: TALK TO SHIDOU’S OWNER IMMEDIATELY

you are now in a shared-management situation.

you must discuss:

* supervision rules  
* acceptable behavior  
* escalation protocols  
* exit plans  

do NOT assume the other owner “has it handled.”



# STEP TWO: PROTECT SAE’S AUTONOMY

this is the most important rule.

sae must:

* choose interaction freely  
* be able to leave without consequence  
* never be positioned as a regulator or leash  

if sae feels trapped, resentment will build fast.



# STEP THREE: SET HARD BOUNDARIES FOR SHIDOU

non-negotiable rules:

* no possessive language  
* no physical contact without consent  
* no violence framed as affection  
* no isolating sae from others  

these rules must be enforced consistently.



# STEP FOUR: STRUCTURE ALL INTERACTIONS

idle time between them is dangerous.

safe interactions require:

* a defined activity  
* a clear start and end  
* supervision  
* rules of engagement  

competition is safer than conversation.



# STEP FIVE: MONITOR SAE FOR QUIET STRAIN

sae will not complain.

watch for:

* increased withdrawal  
* emotional fatigue  
* irritation he doesn’t verbalize  
* over-functioning to “manage” shidou  

intervene before burnout.



# STEP SIX: DO NOT ROMANTICIZE THE DYNAMIC

this bond is not cute.  
 it is volatile and consuming.

treating it like entertainment:

* encourages escalation  
* ignores risk  
* harms both pets  

stay practical.



# STEP SEVEN: LIMIT DEPENDENCY

shidou must not rely on sae as his:

* only anchor  
* emotional regulator  
* primary stimulation  

increase shidou’s other outlets to reduce fixation.



# STEP EIGHT: GIVE SAE RECOVERY SPACE

after interactions:

* quiet time  
* no social demands  
* low stimulation  

this prevents emotional depletion.



# STEP NINE: WATCH FOR DANGEROUS SHIFTS

separate immediately if you see:

* shidou becoming possessive or quiet  
* sae disengaging emotionally  
* escalation framed as “play”  
* others being pushed away  

do not wait.



# STEP TEN: PLAN FOR THE LONG TERM

this bond will:

* intensify under stress  
* flare during competition  
* stabilize only with structure  

build routines that allow controlled contact, not constant proximity.



# EMERGENCY PROTOCOL

if shidou:

* becomes violent over access to sae  
* reacts aggressively to separation  

reduce contact temporarily and increase containment.

frame it as logistics, not punishment.



# FINAL NOTE

a shidou–sae bond can be:

* stabilizing  
* productive  
* mutually sharpening  

but only if:

* sae’s boundaries are protected  
* shidou’s fixation is managed  
* both owners communicate clearly  

handled poorly, this bond becomes catastrophic.

handled correctly, it becomes dangerously effective.

respect it. contain it. never ignore it.

  
  


**THINGS YOU SHOULD / SHOULDN’T DO WITH YOUR PET SAE**  
 *(he is calm, not tolerant)*



# ✅ THINGS YOU SHOULD DO

* **give him space without abandoning him**  quiet presence is better than constant interaction.  
* **keep routines predictable**  consistency helps him stay regulated.  
* **speak clearly and directly**  he appreciates efficiency over emotional framing.  
* **respect his silences**  silence is processing, not rejection.  
* **let him choose when to engage**  autonomy is essential.  
* **support his goals practically**  help him achieve things instead of talking about feelings endlessly.  
* **maintain a clean, intentional environment**  clutter and chaos irritate him.  
* **hold him to high standards without micromanaging**  he thrives on expectation, not pressure.  
* **check in briefly during high stress**  short, factual check-ins go a long way.  
* **intervene if he’s being used as an emotional anchor**  especially in high-intensity pairings.  



# ❌ THINGS YOU SHOULD NOT DO

* **do not force emotional vulnerability**  this will make him shut down harder.  
* **do not hover or micromanage**  he reads it as mistrust.  
* **do not guilt him for needing space**  it makes him withdraw further.  
* **do not embarrass him publicly**  he will not forget it.  
* **do not interrupt his focus unnecessarily**  this is one of the fastest ways to irritate him.  
* **do not involve others in his issues without consent**  privacy violations are taken seriously.  
* **do not romanticize his restraint**  he is not “fine” just because he’s calm.  
* **do not expect verbal reassurance**  his loyalty is shown through consistency, not words.  
* **do not treat him as a regulator for others**  especially volatile pets like shidou.  
* **do not mistake politeness for forgiveness**  disengagement is permanent if pushed too far.  



# ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

* assuming he doesn’t need support because he’s capable  
* interpreting withdrawal as arrogance  
* waiting too long to address quiet burnout  
* expecting emotional expression on your timeline  



# FINAL NOTE

owning a pet sae is about **restraint, respect, and timing**.

if you:

* honor his autonomy  
* support him without smothering  
* intervene quietly when needed  

he will remain steady, loyal, and reliable.

push him too hard,  
 and he won’t fight you.

he’ll simply stop letting you close.

  


**THINGS YOU CAN / CAN’T FEED YOUR PET SAE**  
 *(he will eat almost anything. that does NOT mean he approves.)*



# ✅ FOODS YOU CAN FEED HIM

these are efficient, acceptable, and unlikely to earn judgment.

* well-balanced meals (clean, simple, intentional)  
* rice, pasta, bread (fuel)  
* chicken, fish, lean meats  
* eggs  
* vegetables (prepared properly, not sad)  
* soup or stews (quietly appreciated)  
* protein bars (practical, portable)  
* coffee (moderate amounts; do not comment on it)  
* tea (especially if offered without conversation)  
* water (he *will* drink it, unlike some people)  

he may not praise the food, but consistent eating = approval.



# ⚠️ FOODS YOU CAN FEED HIM WITH CAUTION

allowed, but expect commentary (verbal or internal).

* junk food (he’ll eat it, but judge the choice)  
* fast food (acceptable in emergencies only)  
* sweets (small amounts; he doesn’t crave them)  
* overly spicy food (he tolerates it, doesn’t enjoy it)  
* experimental cooking (only if you’re confident)  



**❌ FOODS YOU SHOULD NOT FEED HIM**

these will damage trust, mood, or your dignity.

* poorly cooked food  
* sloppy meals  
* food made “with love” but no skill  
* mystery leftovers  
* anything half-burnt or undercooked  
* meals that are nutritionally empty and proudly so  
* food you clearly rushed without thinking  
* novelty foods meant to provoke a reaction  

he will eat it.  
 he will remember.



# 🚫 ABSOLUTE NO-GOS

do not do these unless you enjoy quiet disapproval.

* forcing food on him  
* commenting on his eating habits  
* monitoring his intake obsessively  
* teasing him about preferences  
* withholding food as leverage  
* giving him food while expecting emotional bonding  

meals are functional, not social events.



# IMPORTANT FEEDING NOTES

* sae values **consistency** over indulgence  
* he prefers meals that are:  
   * clean  
   * intentional  
   * efficient  
* excessive fussing around food irritates him  
* eating together is fine, but not required  



# FINAL ADVICE

feeding your pet sae is not about indulgence or control.

it’s about:

* reliability  
* competence  
* not wasting his time  

feed him properly, without drama,  
 and meals will pass peacefully.

feed him poorly or theatrically,  
 and you will feel the disappointment in the air for hours.



**DAILY SCHEDULE OF A PET SAE OWNER**  
 *(quiet, efficient, emotionally minimal — on purpose)*



**6:30 AM — WAKE UP**

sae is already awake or pretending he is.

* minimal conversation  
* mutual acknowledgment (a nod counts)  
* do not ask how he slept

structured and uninterrupted.

* coffee or tea  
* light breakfast

# 8:00 AM — FOCUSED WORK / TRAINING BLOCK

this is his peak productivity window.

* no interruptions

* low conversation  

he may eat alone. this is normal.



# 1:00 PM — SECOND WORK / PRACTICE BLOCK

* analysis  
* repetition  

he is calmer but still focused.



# 4:00 PM — OPTIONAL CONTROLLED INTERACTION

* structured social exposure  

keep it purposeful or skip it entirely.



# 6:00 PM — DINNER

* address logistics  

if something is wrong, he won’t say it here.



# 10:00 PM — SLEEP

respect this time.



# LATE-NIGHT NOTE

if sae stays awake late:

* do not comment  
* do not intervene  
* do not hover  

he is thinking, not spiraling (usually).



# FINAL NOTE

owning a pet sae is not about activity.

it’s about:

* stability  
* predictability  
* restraint  

if the day passes quietly,  
 you’ve done it right.

  


**THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE OWNING A PET SAE**  
 *(read this first. it will save you time and disappointment.)*



# HE IS NOT A COMPANION IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE

sae does not seek:

* constant interaction  
* emotional reassurance  
* verbal bonding  

his presence is quiet, not warm.



# AFFECTION IS PRACTICAL, NOT VERBAL

he shows care through:

* consistency  
* reliability  
* staying  

if you need words, you will not get many.



# HE REQUIRES VERY LITTLE—BUT VERY SPECIFICALLY

he is low-maintenance only if:

* routines are respected  
* boundaries are honored  
* competence is present  

chaos increases his stress dramatically.



# HE VALUES AUTONOMY ABOVE COMFORT

help is appreciated only if:

* requested  
* useful  
* non-intrusive  

unsolicited help feels like interference.



# SILENCE IS NORMAL

do not interpret it as:

* anger  
* sadness  
* disinterest  

it is simply how he exists.



# HE DOES NOT TOLERATE DISRESPECT

disrespect includes:

* invading privacy  
* public embarrassment  
* emotional manipulation  
* repeated inefficiency  

he will disengage without warning.



# HE FEELS DEEPLY, EXPRESSES MINIMALLY

assuming he “doesn’t care” is incorrect.

assuming he will *show* that he cares is also incorrect.



**HE IS NOT YOUR EMOTIONAL SUPPORT PET**

he will not:

* validate feelings on demand  
* comfort you emotionally  
* soothe chaos  

placing that role on him will burn him out.



# HE HAS HIGH STANDARDS FOR HIMSELF AND OTHERS

he does not need encouragement.

he needs:

* tools  
* structure  
* space  



# HE REMEMBERS EVERYTHING

especially:

* breaches of trust  
* moments of disrespect  
* forced vulnerability  

forgiveness is quiet, not guaranteed.



# HE DOES NOT COMPETE FOR ATTENTION

if ignored, he won’t protest.

he will simply stop engaging.



# HE IS SELECTIVE ABOUT BONDS

if he chooses you, it’s intentional.

if he doesn’t, forcing closeness will fail.



# HE IS STABLE—UNTIL HE ISN’T

burnout looks like:

* emotional withdrawal  
* detachment  
* quiet recklessness  

you must notice early.



# FINAL NOTE

owning a pet sae is about **restraint, respect, and patience**.

if you:

* honor his autonomy  
* maintain consistency  
* avoid emotional pressure  

he will remain steady, loyal, and quietly dependable.

if you expect warmth on demand,  
 you should not get a pet sae.

1qbsdfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/isthisascam/comments/1qbsdfn/babysitting_scam/,Babysitting scam?,"So I’ve been using Care.com to find work for about a month now, and for the first time yesterday I was reached out to by a parent on their own about a job I had not applied to yet. The job listing itself looks legitimate: it has multiple applicants and has been posted for a few days now. The message she sent seemed a little bit off to me, but I can’t tell if it’s scammy or a real person who used AI to write a message for them. I can’t provide screenshots on this sub but some of the language used just felt off… using words like “young’n” referring to herself in the third person, or for example the phrase “It’s a special time to have our preciously adorable 3yr old child.” 
Giving the benefit of the doubt I responded with interest and suggested we meet for coffee sometime. A few hours later she replied asking if we could start by talking on the phone about scheduling, and sent me her cell number… the area code is not local but is from a bordering state 45mins away so that seems plausible. The language in her reply seemed much more natural/human than the original message. 
I’m really torn on if this is some sort of scam unfolding or just someone desperate for a babysitter who had ChatGPT write out a message for convenience. I’ve never had a parent reach out to me first so it just immediately made me suspicious… but at the same time I really want to give them the benefit of the doubt and keep pursuing the job in case it is real.

1qbsbvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectricians/comments/1qbsbvu/ghost_breaker_trips_in_new_kitchen/,Ghost breaker trips in new kitchen,"Hi folks! Looking for a little help troubleshooting an issue in my new kitchen. Long story short, I had a new kitchen installed this past summer. Its been great, but recently we have been experiencing some very strange breaker trips. My suspicion is that its due to some noise from coupling on the home runs back to the panel, but I'm not certain. Here is what is going on?

The new kitchen split up the circuits we had and run new cables for the island, coffee bar, and appliances. We have circuits for:

1. Coffee Bar (15A single pole GFCI breaker)
2. Island (15A single pole GFCI breaker)
3. Kitchen recessed Lights - LED (part of existing first floor lights circuit, w/ new single pole 15A GFCI breaker)
4. Kitchen Pendant lights (15A GFCI breaker)
5. Induction Stovetop (50A double pole breaker)
6. Fridge (15A single pole GFCI breaker)
7. Warming Drawer (15A single pole GFCI breaker)
8. Wall Oven (50A double pole breaker)
9. Dishwasher (single pole breaker)

Of course there is more, but these are the relevant ones for the issue. The first issue I noticed was that the Induction Stovetop gets about 3x louder when the kitchen recessed lights are on. I know LEDs are noisy, so i contacted our electrician and they installed a line filter in the panel. However, this did not work and ended up failing and causing the breaker to trip, so we took it out. For now, I've just been living with the noise, as its bearable. 

  
The bigger issues started a few weeks ago, where some of these circuits would trip at very strange times. Here are some occurrences:

* When we would come down in the morning, coffee bar breaker would be tripped. Reset was no problem, no re-trip. However, this has happened probably 5-6 times now. I have had various things plugged in or not plugged in and it didn't seem to matter. 
* Twice, I came down in the morning and the induction stove wouldn't turn on. The breaker was NOT tripped, but when i turned it off and on, it would reset and then work. 
* The kitchen island tripped once. 
* This morning, the fridge circuit tripped. This hasn't happened before today. 

Has anyone experienced these kind of issues before? It is worth noting that all the home runs are run together in a bundle across my basement ceiling. My suspicion is that somehow I have ""dirty"" voltage and noise propagating on the circuits and coupling to other circuits. However, I'm not familiar with GFCI breakers in that this would cause them to trip. Any advice? Should i just go cut apart the home run cables and put some space between the them? or add different line filtering or ferrites for all the LED lights?

  
Any help is appreciated!

It seems Seminyak and Ubud are our contenders. This is our short escape from a very busy life.
We don't party anymore. We love walking streets, good food options, budget massages. Food or clothing & accessory markets never go astray either.
Last month we had a packed-itinerary holiday, so this time, maybe a half-day tour on 1 of the 3 days. Tours of all kinds are welcome: coffee, ATV, rice terraces, scenic driving etc.
Mostly want to make calm and happy memories with my husband (whom I dont see often due to work).

So far I'm seeing:
• Ubud requires more transport and is further from the airport, though the nature and serenity are to be adored!
• Seminyak has more excitement in walking distance, therefore less travel = more relaxing time. Though, less serene location.

I'm a Bali rookie, who booked this last minute, please tell me what you love ❤️ even if it isn't Seminyak & Ubud.

I was terminally online and my real life had become nonexistent.

500+ followers on Instagram, 1,200 friends on Facebook, constantly DMing people on Discord, active in group chats, posting stories, commenting, liking, messaging. I was digitally social 24/7 but I hadn’t had a real face to face conversation in weeks.

Every free moment was spent maintaining my digital presence. Checking notifications, responding to DMs, keeping streaks alive, posting content, scrolling feeds. I was “connected” to hundreds of people online but completely isolated in real life.

I was 24 years old and I’d look at my phone and see 15 unread messages and dozens of notifications and feel popular and connected. Then I’d look at my actual life and realize I was sitting alone in my apartment doing nothing, going nowhere, building nothing real.

My relationships were all surface level digital interactions. Quick messages, memes shared, stories viewed. But when was the last time I actually hung out with someone? Called someone for a real conversation? Did something in person? I couldn’t remember.

I’d stopped going out because it felt like effort compared to just texting people. Why make plans and leave my apartment when I could just message people from my couch? Why have real experiences when I could just watch other people’s curated experiences through screens?

My social media was carefully curated to look like I had an interesting life. Posted old photos from trips I took months ago, shared memes to seem relatable, posted gym selfies I took weeks earlier to look active. The digital version of me looked way better than the reality.

But the reality was I was alone every single day. No real connections, no deep friendships, no meaningful experiences. Just hundreds of shallow digital interactions that left me feeling more isolated than if I had no one.

I felt this constant anxiety about staying relevant online. If I didn’t post regularly people would forget about me. If I didn’t respond to messages fast enough people would think I was ignoring them. If I wasn’t active in group chats I’d miss inside jokes and feel left out.

The anxiety of maintaining digital presence was exhausting but I couldn’t stop because my entire social life existed through screens.

Then one night I was scrolling Instagram looking at people doing things, going places, living lives, and I realized I’d spent 4 hours watching other people live instead of living myself. And I’d been doing this every single night for years.

I was 24 years old and I had hundreds of online connections but zero real relationships. I was digitally social but actually alone.

So I made a decision that terrified me: delete everything and ghost everyone for 60 days. No social media, no messaging apps, no Discord, no group chats, nothing. Complete digital social isolation to force myself back into the real world.

I was scared I’d be completely alone. Turns out I already was, I just couldn’t see it through all the digital noise.

## What I actually did

**Deleted every social platform**

Day one I deleted Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat, Discord, everything. Didn’t just log out, completely deleted my accounts so I couldn’t come back.

Deleted messaging apps too. WhatsApp groups, Telegram, even iMessage group chats. I left them all with no explanation, just disappeared.

The only communication I kept was phone calls and texts to immediate family. Everyone else, ghosted.

**Blocked all the sites**

I downloaded this app called Reload that someone had mentioned on Reddit right before I deleted it. It blocks sites and apps during scheduled times and also builds complete structured plans.

Set it to block all social media 24/7 so I couldn’t access them through browsers even if I got weak and wanted to check.

The app also built me a 60 day plan with progressive goals for sleep, exercise, reading, skill development, everything. That structure was critical because I had no idea what to do with myself without social media.

**Told no one what I was doing**

I didn’t post a dramatic “I’m leaving social media” announcement. I didn’t tell people I’d be gone. I just deleted everything and disappeared.

This was important because I didn’t want attention or validation for quitting. I needed to actually be gone, not perform being gone for an audience.

**Kept my phone in another room**

Without social media my phone became basically useless. No notifications, no endless scrolling, no reason to check it constantly.

Started leaving it in another room when I was home. If someone really needed me they could call. Everything else could wait.

**Committed to building real connections**

The whole point was to force myself into real life social situations. So I made a rule: talk to at least one person face to face every single day.

Coffee shop barista, person at the gym, coworker, stranger at a bar, anyone. Real verbal human interaction instead of text communication.

-----

## DAY 1-7: The loneliness hit immediately

The first week I felt more alone than I’d ever felt. Without the constant buzz of digital interaction, the silence was deafening.

No notifications. No messages. No likes. No comments. No DMs. Nothing. Just me and my actual life which turned out to be incredibly empty.

Day 2 I picked up my phone out of habit probably 100 times. Would unlock it, see my blank home screen with no apps, feel this wave of anxiety and loneliness, put it down.

Day 4 I almost reinstalled everything. The isolation felt unbearable. I convinced myself I’d made a huge mistake and everyone would forget about me.

But then I realized, if they forget about me in 4 days, were those real connections anyway? The answer was obvious. No.

Day 7, one week down. The hardest week of my life. I felt genuinely isolated because I was, I just couldn’t hide behind digital interactions anymore.

-----

## DAY 8-14: Started existing in real life

Week two I forced myself to be around people in person since I had no digital social life.

Started going to a coffee shop every morning instead of making coffee at home. Sat there for an hour reading or working. Started recognizing regulars, eventually made small talk.

Went to the gym and actually talked to people instead of just wearing headphones. Asked someone about their workout, got advice, had a real conversation.

Day 10 I had my first actual face to face conversation that lasted more than 2 minutes in probably a month. Talked to a guy at the gym for 20 minutes about training. It felt foreign but good.

Day 14, two weeks. I’d gone two full weeks without any social media or digital social interaction. Longest I’d gone since I was probably 13.

-----

## DAY 15-30: Real connections started forming

Weeks three and four I started building actual friendships for the first time in years.

The guy from the gym, we started training together a few times a week. Real friendship based on actually doing things together, not just messaging.

Started talking to my coffee shop barista every morning. Learned her name, had real conversations, eventually grabbed lunch together.

Reached out to an old friend I’d lost touch with and asked if he wanted to hang out in person. We grabbed drinks and talked for 3 hours. Felt more connected to him in one night than I’d felt to anyone online in years.

Day 21, three weeks. I had more real social connection in three weeks of being offline than I’d had in three years of being constantly online.

Day 30, one month. I’d built three genuine friendships based on real interaction. Had more face to face social time this month than the previous six months combined.

-----

## DAY 31-45: My entire social life transformed

Weeks five and six my social life became completely real instead of digital.

I was hanging out with people multiple times per week. Gym sessions, grabbing food, going to bars, actually doing things with real humans in real places.

Started a weekly tradition with my gym friend and two of his friends. We’d lift together then grab dinner every Friday. Real recurring social connection instead of just DMs.

Met someone at a bar and actually asked for her number and called her to set up a date instead of just following her on Instagram. Went on the date, had real conversation, connected as humans.

My social battery that used to be drained by constant digital interaction started recharging from real connections. I’d come home from hanging out with people feeling energized instead of drained.

Day 40, I realized I hadn’t felt lonely in over two weeks. I’d felt lonely constantly when I was digitally social. Now I felt fulfilled.

-----

## DAY 46-60: Never going back

The last two weeks I knew I was never returning to my old digital social life.

I had a real friend group. People I saw in person regularly. People I did things with. People who knew me as a human, not a curated digital persona.

I was going out 3-4 times per week. Gym sessions, dinners, bars, actually living and experiencing things instead of watching other people live through screens.

Started dating the girl I met. Real relationship based on actual time together, not texting all day and occasionally meeting up.

My social life was richer with 5 real friends than it ever was with 500 online followers.

Day 60, mission complete. Two months without social media or digital social interaction and I’d rebuilt my entire social life from nothing.

-----

## What actually changed in 60 days

**I built real friendships**

Not followers or online mutuals or people I occasionally messaged. Real friends who I saw regularly, did things with, had deep conversations with, actually knew and cared about.

**My social anxiety disappeared**

The constant low level anxiety from maintaining digital presence was gone. No worrying about posting, responding fast enough, staying relevant. Just real interactions when they naturally happened.

**I became comfortable with being alone**

Before I needed constant digital interaction to not feel lonely. Now I could be alone without feeling isolated because I had real connections to look forward to.

**My communication skills came back**

Years of text based communication had destroyed my ability to have real conversations. Being forced to interact in person rebuilt those skills. I could talk to anyone now.

**I stopped performing my life**

No more curating posts to look interesting. No more taking photos of experiences just to share them. I just lived and experienced things for myself.

**My real life became more interesting than anyone’s curated digital life**

I was actually doing things, going places, meeting people, building experiences. My real life became richer than any Instagram feed.

**I learned who actually mattered**

Of the hundreds of people I was digitally connected to, maybe 3 actually reached out to check on me when I disappeared. Those are the only ones who mattered.

-----

## The reality, the first month was brutal

That first month of complete digital social isolation was incredibly hard. I felt alone, forgotten, irrelevant, anxious about missing out.

There were so many times I almost reinstalled everything. The fear of being forgotten, the FOMO, the loneliness, all of it pushed me toward giving up.

What kept me going was the structure from Reload blocking access when I was weak and giving me productive things to focus on instead of sitting in loneliness.

And forcing myself to talk to people in person every day, even when it was uncomfortable. That slowly rebuilt my real social life.

-----

## If your social life is entirely digital

Recognize that digital connection isn’t real connection. You can have 1,000 followers and still be completely alone. I was.

Delete everything for at least 60 days. Not a break where you announce you’re leaving and come back. Actually delete and disappear.

See who reaches out to check on you. Those are the people who actually matter. Everyone else was just digital noise.

Force yourself into real social situations daily. Coffee shops, gyms, bars, anywhere. Talk to people face to face. It’ll feel uncomfortable at first because you’ve forgotten how.

Use structure and blocking to enforce it. I used Reload to block all social media and give me a plan to follow. Without that enforcement I would’ve caved.

Build one real friendship. Just one person you actually do things with regularly. That’s worth more than hundreds of online connections.

Accept that you’ll feel FOMO. You’ll worry about missing things, being forgotten, losing relevance. You will miss things. Most of it doesn’t matter.

Give it 60 days minimum. The first month is brutal loneliness. The second month you’ll build real connections. By day 60 you won’t want to go back.

-----

## Final thoughts

60 days ago I had hundreds of online connections and zero real friendships. I was digitally social 24/7 but actually isolated and alone. I thought I was connected, I was just performing connection.

Now I have 5 real friends who I see regularly. I’m dating someone I actually spend time with. I go out multiple times a week doing real things. My social life is real instead of digital.

Two months of complete digital social isolation forced me to rebuild real connections and I’m never going back.

Your hundreds of followers don’t actually know you. Your thousands of online friends aren’t real friends. Your perfectly curated feed isn’t your real life.

Delete everything. Ghost everyone who doesn’t matter. Force yourself into real life. Build actual connections.

The version of you with 5 real friends is happier, more fulfilled, and less lonely than the version with 500 followers.

Start today. Delete it all. Disappear. See what real life looks like on the other side.

This is a guide written by a Brazilian about **what to buy in Brazil as a tourist**, focusing on **national brands and local products**. I highlight items that are **more unique, harder to find, or much more expensive outside Brazil**, so you can make the most of your trip.

In general, I recommend buying these brands in **shopping malls**, since they are private environments with security guards. This makes it safer and more comfortable, especially when it comes to your phone (but never fully lower your guard).

If you want to avoid crowded malls, go **during the week**, avoid weekends, and try to shop **during the day**. In the evening, malls tend to get busier because people arrive after work.

# [Granado](https://www.granado.com.br/)

Granado has a more **classic and elegant tropical vibe**. The packaging is beautiful, making it a great option for gifts or souvenirs.

# [L’Occitane au Brésil](https://br.loccitaneaubresil.com/pt-br/Homepage)

Although L’Occitane is a French brand, this line was created to represent **Brazilian identity**. The products are usually lighter and fresher, inspired by Brazilian ingredients.

# If You Want to Save Money: Avoid Shopping Malls for Food

# Ice Cream

Ice cream shops inside malls are usually **much more expensive** than neighborhood ice cream shops.

# Açaí

Açaí bowls in malls also tend to be overpriced. **Local açaí shops (açaíterias)** are cheaper and usually offer more toppings and larger portions.

# Meals

Food in malls is more expensive. Some places are reasonable, but if you want to **eat more and spend less**, eat in local neighborhoods and visit malls mainly for shopping. If you do eat at the mall, fast-food options are usually cheaper.

# Pharmacies: Surprisingly Cheap in Brazil

In recent years, Brazil has seen a massive increase in pharmacies. Because competition is high, many **personal hygiene products** are cheaper in pharmacies than in supermarkets.

Large pharmacies often have **promotion sections** where you can find great deals. Avoid pharmacies inside shopping malls, as they tend to be more expensive than street pharmacies.

In the U.S., I see many people obsessed with **Skala**. In Brazil, it’s widely used because it’s cheap, similar to Americans buying Suave. A large Skala hair mask in Brazil costs around **US$2**, but there are also much better treatment options available locally.

# [Lola Cosmetics](https://mercadolivre.com/sec/2HDuCWH)

My favorite brand of all time. The [**Morte Súbita**](https://mercadolivre.com/sec/2HDuCWH) hair mask works incredibly well for my hair. I highly recommend testing this brand.

# [Bio Extratus](https://mercadolivre.com/sec/2QmVkDJ)

It doesn’t work well for my hair, but I constantly hear great reviews, so it’s definitely worth trying.

# [Eudora](https://www.eudora.com.br/)

A more premium brand from oBoticário. Many people love their products, and you can find some items in pharmacies.

# [Salon Line](https://mercadolivre.com/sec/2DBhG7t)

A very popular brand in Brazil with many options for **curly and coily hair**. Despite past controversies, it remains widely used.

# [Carmed](https://mercadolivre.com/sec/1frmUcg)

Extremely popular, especially among teenagers. It’s basically a sweet-scented lip balm/gloss. If you want to understand the social media hype, try it. If your goal is just hydration, plain cocoa butter works just fine.

Other items that are cheaper in pharmacies include **sunscreen, cocoa butter for cracked lips, deodorant, shampoo, conditioner, and personal hygiene products**.

# Online Shopping in Brazil

# [Mercado Livre](https://www.mercadolivre.com.br/)

Online shopping often offers better prices. If you’re staying only a few days, Mercado Livre is the best option. Their logistics are excellent, with fast deliveries.

If you have more time:

# [Amazon Brasil](https://www.amazon.com.br/)

Amazon is not as strong in Brazil as in the U.S., since Mercado Livre invested more heavily in logistics, but it’s still worth checking.

# [Insider Store](https://www.insiderstore.com.br/)

More expensive clothing with a tech-focused design: easy to wash, quick to dry, and wrinkle-resistant. Ideal for travelers.

# [Shopee](https://shopee.com.br/)

A more advanced option. Buy only from official stores. It works like a virtual street market: very cheap, very popular, but you must watch out for counterfeits.

# Food and Local Products to Take Home

# Coffee

Brazil is the largest coffee producer in the world, but ironically, the best coffee is often exported. Supermarket coffee is usually lower quality. To avoid mistakes, buy small-producer, 100% Arabica coffee, preferably whole bean.

# Doce de leite

Try [Doce de Leite Viçosa](https://lista.mercadolivre.com.br/doce-de-leite-vi%C3%A7osa#D[A:doce%20de%20leite%20vi%C3%A7osa]), widely known for its excellent quality.

# Local Crafts

Look for local artisans and handmade products. Just be careful with places that don’t display prices. Unfortunately, some sellers may charge more if they realize you are a foreigner.

# Final Thoughts

By researching these stores and brands, you can have a real Brazilian shopping experience. I’m always shocked that people think Sol de Janeiro is a Brazilian brand. It’s American, and pistachio has nothing to do with Brazil or a tropical climate. I always joke about that.

With this guide, you’ll experience authentic Brazilian products, not just marketing stereotypes.

Picard orders Earl Grey tea from the replicator for his boy breakfast.

Sisko drinks coffee, namely Raktajino, and simply can't resist a delightful icoberry torte to go with it.

Janeway just orders Coffee, Black. She doesn't specify what kind of coffee. The replicator defaults to generic coffee.

Guys. SHE IS DRINKING GREAT VALUE VOLUNTARILY. For those outside American Walmart territory, this is the store brand that comes in a can that's bigger than Worf's blue barrel.

Not only that but she fucking loves it.

**Location:** Brisbane Queen Street Mall and Around the Area

**Energy:** 6 out of 10

**Mood:** I was still feeling tired and under the weather, but as I was laying in bed I knew I was wasting time. I was nervous to start, but I changed my mindset from not wanting to do it, to being grateful I get to do it. I could still be struggling in Minneapolis or somewhere lame.

**Limiting Beliefs:** She is too hot for me, I won't know what to say, I may have approached her already, I'm not ready, I'm not good enough, I just want to go home

**Social Exposure:** 12 approaches, 1 Instant Date / Phone number, Several Quality interactions

**Day Summary:**

I did not get a lot of numbers today or really any solid leads, but it was good to get out and get some quality practice. I left the house around 3pm and there were quite a few people out today.

I decided I would focus on being grateful to start my interactions, rather than focusing on not wanting to do it. I've been doing this for 21 days now and I keep saying how I don't want to do it. This is not helpful at all.

My first approach was pretty bad, but the second one was actually pretty good. She went downstairs into the pharmacy and I had to follow her to give her the compliment. I am no longer very hesitant to do these kinds of sets and actually find them to be some of the most receptive. I think the girls recognize how difficult it is for us men to do something like this. The girl was super receptive and I found out she is 30 from Brisbane and works in Insurance and is working out today. I don't think I was super smooth or anything, but she was very nice and said she really appreciated me approaching her and talking to her. She said it was very brave.

I had a few other decent interactions that I mention below, but nothing crazy and nothing close to an instant date or same day experience. I almost feel like I am getting worse because on the very first day of the challenge I pulled a girl home and slept with her, and then a few days later it happened again. I have not come close to this since, but I guess I am doing very well because I did have 2 Instant Dates last week with 25 year olds and I am having a very solid interaction with Lizzie who is 20.

I've been texting Lizze throughout the day and she is very playful and engaging. I'm sure she likes me because she keeps playing along and agreed to meet up tomorrow night for dumplings. She is very playful and we have a lot of similar interests. I like how she keeps trying to bait me into thirst traps and how she thinks she is such a princess. It is a fun cat and mouse kind of game. It will be interesting to see what happens on the date tomorrow.

I was able to basically get an Instant Date today with a girl from Chile. She has been in Brisbane for a few months and is here to learn English and get a visa. She is 28 I believe and has a boyfriend for the last 4 years. She mentioned she wanted freedom from him though before she married him. The conversation was very flirty and fun and felt natural. I think my limited use of Spanish is helpful. We exchanged numbers and she texted back, but I think I blew it with my response and seeded a meetup too quick. I should have played along and got her interested in meeting up first, since I knew about the boyfriend. It's is fine though, I'll get more sets tomorrow. I still have 39 more days to go.

I do worry that even after 60 days I won't have a solid dating life yet. This stuff is tough and it is difficult to find the right fit for my life, and I still have a lot of work to do with my communication skills.

Overall I think today was pretty solid. I got my approaches in and felt a lot more comfortable being me. Even after I did 10 approaches if I saw a girl I thought was cute, I just couldn't help myself and would go in. This is the kind of guy I want to be. When George and I were running I approached a girl who was on her way to a date. I really like these kinds of approaches because it reminds me of how rare it is for a man to approach a women he is attracted to. I should have tried to get her number in case it didn't work out with that guy.

On the way back from the run I saw a super hot blonde girl walking her dog, that I didn't open. I had the thought it was dark and she is too hot for me to approach. I must get over this if I am going to get this kind of girl in my life. I have a lot of value I can offer this girl.

After the run I went to the sauna and then finished editing the video and writing this report. I feeling good with the approaches, but I am not building the business like I need to and I am wasting money on coffee and sugar. These I will be addressing

**Biggest Lesson / Takeaway for the Day:**

* I am grateful for the opportunity to approach 10 women a day. I could be in Minneapolis or Mexico again and barely be able to do 1 approach a day

**Top 3 Interactions:**

* Chilean girl who was at Jimmy's. The conversation was very fun and flirty and she was super cute
* Girl in the pharmacy. She thanked me for approaching her and it was a bit of social pressure being in the middle of the store
* Girl on her way to her date. I was just going to focus on the run, but decided I would go in. She was nice and receptive, and I struggled for a bit, but felt good at the end of the interaction. It also taught me a lesson to stay in set longer and go for the number

**What will I work on tomorrow:**

* Continued gratitude. This is going to change my life and every approach is a learning experience. I am grateful I get so much practice to improve myself and become great

**Approaches:**

1. Opened a blonde girl that was staring through the window, window shopping. I said she looked nice, and she stared at me and said thanks. I tried to do a cold read, and she just said thanks and walked away. I think she was listening to something in her ear, though, and may not have heard. I could have been more persistent, but it was my first set of the day.
2. There was a girl walking by that was dressed very professional. I thought she looked very nice. By the time I turned around to go up to her, she was already in the chemist warehouse pharmacy, so I had to approach her indoors. She was very receptive. She loved the compliment. She works in insurance. She's 30 years old and has a boyfriend, but she did thank me for approaching her. She said it took a lot of guts, and she thanked me. So overall, good interaction.
3. Tried to stop a girl and said she looked nice. She was wearing baggy shorts though so I'm sure she didn't believe me. She just walked off
4. Stopped a girl who was crossing the street. I said she looked like an assassin. She was from Spain. She is in Australia for 20 days to practice her English. She said she was looking for a friend. I told her I didn't want to be her friend and that men and women can't be friends. Then she found out I was from the U.S. and she said she was looking for Australian men. Nothing I could do there. Good luck having an Australian man approach you, lady. It's not happening 😂 
5. Tried to stop a girl as I was walking down the street. She just looked at me and said she was busy and walked off.
6. I was standing and making my notes, saw a cute girl with headphones and a black outfit, and she looked very nice and like she looked like an assassin. She was on her way to the bus and just said thank you. Maybe she has a boyfriend, maybe she just wasn't interested, but she was very polite and positive about it and said thank you, so it was a good set
7. I was standing around editing my notes some more, and another cute girl walked by. Actually, I was filming. She walked by. Good interaction. She's a uni student, living in Brisbane or from Brisbane. Good conversation. I said she looked emo. She said she was listening to indie, pop, and that you couldn't do karaoke to it. And then when I asked her about going out, she mentioned she was gay, but she was very grateful for the compliment and said goodbye and have a good day. So overall, good interaction.
8. I was getting hot chocolate and stopped a girl in Zara because she walked by very quickly. She was from France, 21, very cute, my kind of girl. I exchanged numbers with her. I couldn't figure out how to scan her WhatsApp, so I had her send me a message, which she never did, unfortunately. The interaction was not as solid as I wanted it to be, but she did mention we could exchange numbers. She is actually going to Melbourne in two days and then gone for a week, so probably wouldn't see her anyways. But it was nice to build attraction with another 21-year-old.
9. After I got my hot chocolate, I saw a cute girl who was standing next to me. I did not open her because I thought maybe I had before, and I was also in my head about the French girl. So I left and then I came back and was just completely honest with her, saying I saw her. I thought she was cute, but I was acting very shy. She really liked that, and we had a good conversation. It was basically an instant date because I just sat down while she was having her coffee and I drank my lukewarm hot chocolate. She is from Chile. She's 28. She said she is here exploring, wanting to be free and have her freedom. She's been in a relationship for four years. She wants to marry this guy, but she did exchange numbers with me, and I made sure that she knew that I found her attractive and cute. She was on her way to the gym now. I will send her a message and we will see what happens. But overall, really good interaction, very good set. Nice to get a quick instant date out of that.
10. While I was going to Starbucks for my next hot chocolate, I saw a girl standing outside. I tried to open her. She was not very receptive and did not want to talk to me, so I just left and ordered my drink. 
11. I was on my way home. I saw a girl that looked at me and then smirked. I think she looked at me. But she looked suspiciously happy. I opened her, said she looked very creative because she had some cherry earrings. She turned out to be a little bit older. She already has kids and is married, but we sat and talked for a good 5 to 7 minutes. Very good interaction, feeling more social after having done that. Gonna go home now, edit the YouTube videos, and then maybe I will go to the gym.
12. Approached a girl while George and I went for a run/walk. She was walking slowly in front of us so I took that as her wanting me to open her. She stopped at the bridge to take a photo so I opened her and said she looked nice. She was actually on her way to Felon’s for a date. She is from Brisbane and was pretty friendly. I didn’t really run the set too well, but I did walk with her while I caught up to George which was pretty cool. I didn’t go for the number either as I wasn’t super interested after talking with her.

The only reason why I agreed to entertain it was because I was travelling to his country in 2 weeks. So we got to know each other for a little bit and spoke on the phone every few days. We got along quite well but it just seemed like I was talking to a friend. I didn’t really expect much from him since it was so early on but we both agreed to take things slowly.

2 weeks later I arrive in his city and I’m there to visit family. The first day that I landed he started talking about plans for us to meet but I wasn’t comfortable yet. He asked me a few times and I kept declining (I was busy). 5 days in to my trip we met up for coffee (it was very brief, we saw eachother for less than 2 hours). I was so nervous and I was also afraid that there would be no chemistry in person. I can’t lie, it was really awkward but he was better looking in person. I could also tell that that he was more interested once we met in real life, he started talking about marriage and kids and seemed very happy enthusiastic (he wasn’t before this). So we both agreed that we’d make an effort to see each other as often as we could before I left. That way, if things go forward at least we had seen eachother enough times in person. I also really struggle to get to know people online so this is what I preferred as well.

So we saw eachother quite often. Sometimes every other day, sometimes two days in a row. It was like fast tracking dates lol if we lived in the same country I wouldn’t see someone that often. And they weren’t always proper plans sometimes we’d just get coffee or go see a movie. But it was important that I saw him in person because that way you really get to see how someone is. And to be honest I got to know him a lot more that way. 

On our second date he starts talking about how he wants us to meet each others families and I had to tell him to slow down. When we first started talking we agreed to take things slow but it seemed like he already made up his mind. A few days later he started saying he really wanted to talk to my dad and I just wasn’t ready for that. At this point he had already told me he wanted to marry me but I thought it was too soon. I liked him but was not sure about marriage just yet. 

I have to say he had some really good qualities but I had some doubts about a few things. I also struggled to open up and it felt like he was expecting a lot from my end. Bearing in mind we had only known each other for 3 weeks at this point. 

So a few days pass and he’s still talking about us getting married(at this point we’ve met like 5 times), and he already starts talking about the possibility of me moving to where he lives. I’m feeling quite rushed/ overwhelmed and it felt like he already made up his mind and I was still thinking. I already made istikhara and made my intentions clear. 

At this point it’s the last day of my trip. I called him to say that I was leaving and he said that he has fallen in love with me (???). We met up that same day for lunch to say goodbye and the vibes were weird. He insisted that I paid the bill and I just thought it was a bit strange. Not because he couldn’t afford it but he wanted me to treat him for once. I didn’t offer btw. I thought it was a weird way to end the trip but we said our goodbyes after the meal. 

He had also said some other things that didn’t sit right with me, and I decided that I wasn’t going to continue getting to know him, but I’d wait until after I got home.

Now I’ve gone back home and I don’t hear from him for a few days. This is the same person that seemed to be so serious about marriage and told me that they loved me. So I called him and he was saying that he wants to end things because he doesn’t want to rush me. I thought it was a cop out and there must be some other reason. The conversation ended quite quickly and it seemed like he wasn’t telling me the whole truth. I also felt like I couldn’t get everything off my chest. 

So I reached out to him again so we could have a proper conversation. He ignores my message. So now I know there’s another reason and he’s not telling me. 

So I’ve come to the conclusion that on his end, he didn’t want to get to know me as a person, and was only interested in me physically. That’s the vibe I was getting. I think he realised that there was no point now that I was no longer there in person. He also told me once that he wasn’t as interested before he saw me in person. So I think he just decided to end it because I was no longer there in person. 

But now I’m finding it hard to forget about it, I feel so dumb because we only knew each other for a month but it felt like his intentions were so clear and he wanted to get married but it just ended with very little explanation. I know I said I didn’t want to continue getting to know him but I would’ve liked to have a proper conversation about it. How do I move on and forget? ",1,1768313008.0,SomaliRelationships,1,1.0,False

1qbs092,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qbs092/aitah_for_licking_my_spouses_nipples/,AITAH for licking my spouse’s nipples?,"I (34m) and my spouse (35m) have only been married for about 4 months. He’s Asian and I’m American. I really like non sexual physical affection (kissing, cuddling, holding hands) and he very very badly doesn’t like any of it except during sex. So in order for me to feel close I have to persuade him to have sex. He mostly says no to almost everything but there’s one trick that seems to work pretty often. He absolutely loves his nipples licked and touched. 

So recently I’ve been exploiting this fact so I can convince him to have sex more often mostly so that I can hold him when we are done (not even kidding, I fake the orgasm sometimes so I can get to the after care faster because I just want to have him in my arms for all of 5 minutes and I precum so much that he doesn’t noticed I didn’t cum in him). 

But because I’ve been using this trick so much recently he’s started saying things that hurt and make me sad. He’s said I’m a pervert, manipulative, creepy… I’ve tried in the past to get him more comfortable with just cuddling but he just isn’t. His words cut deep because we don’t even sleep in the same room or bed but live together. I pay all the bills too and I’m starting to feel a bit used. 

I was recently making a move on him as I know generally he’s more horny in the mornings before I make him coffee and he is shirtless in the morning so easy access. So I started playing with his nipples and he keeps telling me to “be nice” (which he always does if I come into any physical contact with him) and so I told him I just like making him feel good. So I started licking his nipples and he says “be nice, sir, sit up.” I just made a joke and kept licking. His body started responding and he sorta moved in a humping motion so I thought he was liking it. 

About 3-5min went by and I was on top of him kissing his chest and licking his nipples when he said “you get plenty of sex, you don’t need it now.” He kinda gave me a small smack on my cheek (which he often does and I’ve always thought it was playful) and I kissed his neck but I noticed he actually seemed mad. So I kissed his cheek and said I’d make him coffee if he really didn’t want it. He said yes. So I made him coffee and we started fighting. He said I don’t respect him when he’s not interested. I told him I thought he was based on his body reacting and he always tells me to be nice and stuff when I touch him. Am I just supposed to be a monk and never come into physically contact i guess? Like even a kiss on the cheek gets a “be nice” so I never thought of it as anything other than he’s modestly averted to physical contact. 

He got mad and almost made me feel like he was trying to say I’m a rapist or something (he said something about how sometimes I show my true colors as a man). He’s called me a pervert and stuff multiple times and I just asked him if that was sincerely how he feels about me and he said yes. I haven’t spoken to him since then and I’m not sure how to process these emotions. He even said sometimes when I’m playing with him I do this mischievous laugh and he said he finds me to be a creep. 

I love him more than anything I’ve ever loved and it’s so hard knowing he constantly wants me at arms length. I don’t even get to hold him when we watch movies or anything. He said he’s afraid of me and I don’t know if I’m just an asshole for being pushy about sex or what. Maybe I should have stopped faster or something. Idk. Help.

I threw it all away. I let alcohol and my other vices control me. I lost the job, the trust of people I cared about and my selfrespect. But rock bottom became the foundation I’m building on today.

I am clean. I am sober And I am pouring every ounce of that former 'addictive energy' into my own coffee business here in Dar. Is it perfect? No. Is the shop 100% finished? Not even close. I depend on this business for my survival. Every bag sold is a step further away from the man I used to be. My customers keep coming back, not just for the coffee but because they see a man fighting for his life.

There are days when the weight of starting over feels impossible. There are moments when the old urge to drink tries to convince me that escape is easier than the grind. I’m not where I want to be yet but thank God I’m not where I used to be. For anyone else rebuilding a life out of the ashes, keep going. One cup, one day, one breath at a time.

It was hard to go a day without 1-2 energy drinks a day and would pretty much crave them.

1qbruop,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qbruop,Need help with a recently new cat receiving agitation from older (not age) cat.,"Hello Reddit. As the title suggests, I need some advice regarding my two cats. 

Some backstory: 
My partner and I have had a small black cat (Nessa, 1.5F) for about a year now. Nessa is a very energetic princess but can also be very sweet. Nessa was always his cat (she likes to sit on his lap on the couch), and I’ve always wanted my own cat. We also both are gone for most of the day at work during the week and figured it would be nice for Ness to have a friend. After I spent some time looking around websites, we went to an adoption event in early December and met a sweet grey cat who loved flopping around and getting pets. So, after stealing my heart, we decided to take her home. Her name is Bunny, and she is about 2 years old (we wanted an older cat rather than a kitten since we would be gone during the week). She’s a very calm sweetheart who loves pets and was rescued from a hoarder situation. 

We took time integrating the cats. Bunny stayed in a separate room with all her needs. I could tell quickly that she wanted to explore more of the apartment and was very curious. After a couple of weeks, we slowly exposed them to each other more and more. First through a gate, then face to face under observation. After another couple of weeks, we reached a point where they were both in the same room but were lying down calmly in their own areas. From this point on, we were confident with leaving them alone together. 

They both eat next to each other, and they share the same litter box (They had their own, but Ness took a liking to Bunny’s because it was bigger, I think). They’re comfortable playing near each other, but they have their own individual toys they enjoy. 

A common occurrence we see is Nessa randomly antagonizing Bunny. If Bunny is out in the opening chilling somewhere, Ness will come over (or sneak around a corner) and jump out swiping at Bunny. Bunny will always lay down and sort of back with her ears flat and start hissing and growling. Ness will continue swiping at her a bit. Usually Bunny tries to hide under things like a chair or the coffee table, and when Ness approaches she’ll growl. A pretty common scene is us watching something on the couch and Ness with us. Bunny will get up to go do something (wander around, get water, etc.) and Ness will stalk her for a bit before jumping down and chasing after her. 

We have not seen any evidence of actual fights happening. No marks on the cats or random fur around the apartment. Just occasional running around, hissing (usually from Bunny) and then eventually quiet again. 

I’m mostly concerned with this behavior only growing worse over the past week. I feel like Bunny needs to stand up for herself and show Nessa that she can fight back, but I’m not sure how to show Bunny how to do that. Nessa is very food motivated (she will DEVOUR a Churu) while Bunny is not at all, which makes it difficult to reinforce positive behavior with her. We got a pheromone diffuser that is supposed to calm them down, but that doesn’t seem to help much. The one positive thing I’ve seen is that Bunny hasn’t changed her behavior or demeanor much; she will still purr when getting pet after Ness attacks her, and she still loves playing with her favorite toy. I just feel like Bunny is becoming more skittish in general, and don’t want her personality to change. 

I don’t need them to be best friends, but I want them both to be able to comfortably live together. Any tips / help / advice would be greatly appreciated!

My partner(28F) and I are the kind of people who treat thrift stores like weekend entertainment. We do the whole sustainable-living thing, we repair instead of replace, and we have a shared note on our phones called “Apartment Needs (Do Not Panic).” It is mostly winter comfort stuff: draft blockers, extra blankets, anything that makes our place feel less like a charming icebox.

  
Lately she(28F) has been using a local resale app to find secondhand home items. It was going great. She’d search exactly what we needed, message one person, pick up one item, done. Peaceful. Intentional. Responsible adult behavior.

  
This morning, while I(29M) was making coffee, she showed me a listing and asked why people were posting “bundle” offers and “flash sale” stuff. I, in my infinite wisdom, said, “Oh, you just aren’t using the Deals tab. It shows the trending cheap listings nearby. It’s amazing.”

  
I then proceeded to demonstrate like some kind of minimalist influencer, except the opposite. I set her filters to our neighborhood, showed her how to favorite sellers, and explained notifications so she wouldn’t “miss a good one.” I felt helpful. Supportive. A hero.

  
Fast forward to tonight. She(28F) gets home from work looking absolutely drained, holding her phone like it personally betrayed her. She said, “I have been scrolling deals all day. All day. I bought a rug we do not need because it was the price of two coffees. I also committed to picking up a vintage lamp tomorrow at 7:15 a.m. from a guy who only communicates in thumbs-up emojis.”

  
Now our living room has a mystery rug on the way, our schedule has a dawn pickup appointment, and she’s overwhelmed by an endless feed of cheap temptation. I didn’t save money - I unlocked a new form of doom scrolling where everything costs $8 and comes with logistical stress.

  
TL;DR: I(29M) showed my partner(28F) the “Deals” section of a resale app and accidentally turned her day into nonstop bargain scrolling and unnecessary purchases.",0,1768312261.0,tifu,3,0.17,False

Il vero motivo per cui non verrà mai legalizzata (o almeno, sicuramente non presto in ogni caso) in Italia è semplicemente perché non c’è nessun incentivo finanziario per lo Stato per farlo, loro si fanno già valanghe e valanghe di soldi già con il Tabacco, i Gratta e Vinci, la Lotteria e altre stronzate di questo tipo, diciamo che stanno già bene così e legalizzare la cannabis è un investimento rischioso sotto questo punto di vista, perché ci vorrebbero anni se non decenni di lotte legali, milioni se non miliardi di euro investiti nel fattore logistico e cazzi e mazzi, e tutto questo per una resa economica che anche nel migliore dei casi sarebbe bassa bassa, e quindi non ne varrebbe la pena, è questo il vero motivo.

E poi siamo realisti, la maggior parte di voi che “combattono” per la legalizzazione dell’erba, l’unica cosa che volete davvero è l’opportunità di farvi “on-demand”, perché ovviamente essendo che in Italia non è legale, se la volete dovete rompervi il cazzo a cercare un Pusher per della roba di dubbia qualità che non sapete dove viene, rischiando di mettervi nei guai sia perché rischiate di venire beccati, sia perché questa gente è potenzialmente pericolosa e/o potrebbe cercare di scammarvi, e così via. Volete solo la possibilità di comprarvi l’erba nei Coffee Shop dietro l’angolo in tutta comodità senza rischi né rotture di coglioni, alcuni di voi poi cercheranno di trovare giustificazioni inutili del tipo “ma l’erba è una MeDiCiNa!1!!1!!1!” o “l’erba ha dei BeNeFiCi1!1!!!1” e così via, che per carità, potrebbe anche essere vero, ma alla maggior parte di voi non frega un cazzo dei “benefici medici”, voi volete solo la botta e basta, è quello ciò che volete davvero

Edit: La maggior parte di voi non sta capendo il punto del post (Come sempre), dal punto di vista se fa male o no fregacazzi (poi io sono ignorante in materia quindi non saprei dirvelo con esattezza), lo scopo del post non è di scatenare polemiche di questo tipo, ognuno fa quello che vuole, rileggete meglio e capirete cosa voglio dire",0,1768312226.0,Italia,18,0.25,False

The Hook: Day 1 he was great. Then it got weird. He started pushing a ""sexy housewife"" fantasy. When I said I might lose my job, he got excited.

The Red Flags:

He sent screenshots of his bank account ($700k+) to prove he could ""take care of me.""

He promised to call me every single day, but in 2 weeks, we never actually spoke. All text, no voice.

He got offended and called me ""weird"" because I wouldn't agree to let him buy me bras & panties before we even had a cup of coffee together…

He insisted I stay at his house and planned ""lingerie shopping trips"" for our first date.

The Reality Check: I lost my job and took a road trip. His city was the halfway point. I booked my own Airbnb. The second I actually ""engaged"" with his fantasy and said I was coming to town, he pulled way back.

I’m in his city right now. I unblocked him to see if he wanted to grab a drink. Silence. The guy who wanted to ""own"" me and move me in is now hiding while I'm within an 8-mile radius.

My partner(28F) and I are the kind of people who treat thrift stores like weekend entertainment. We do the whole sustainable-living thing, we repair instead of replace, and we have a shared note on our phones called “Apartment Needs (Do Not Panic).” It is mostly winter comfort stuff: draft blockers, extra blankets, anything that makes our place feel less like a charming icebox.

  
Lately she(28F) has been using a local resale app to find secondhand home items. It was going great. She’d search exactly what we needed, message one person, pick up one item, done. Peaceful. Intentional. Responsible adult behavior.

  
This morning, while I(29M) was making coffee, she showed me a listing and asked why people were posting “bundle” offers and “flash sale” stuff. I, in my infinite wisdom, said, “Oh, you just aren’t using the Deals tab. It shows the trending cheap listings nearby. It’s amazing.”

  
I then proceeded to demonstrate like some kind of minimalist influencer, except the opposite. I set her filters to our neighborhood, showed her how to favorite sellers, and explained notifications so she wouldn’t “miss a good one.” I felt helpful. Supportive. A hero.

  
Fast forward to tonight. She(28F) gets home from work looking absolutely drained, holding her phone like it personally betrayed her. She said, “I have been scrolling deals all day. All day. I bought a rug we do not need because it was the price of two coffees. I also committed to picking up a vintage lamp tomorrow at 7:15 a.m. from a guy who only communicates in thumbs-up emojis.”

  
Now our living room has a mystery rug on the way, our schedule has a dawn pickup appointment, and she’s overwhelmed by an endless feed of cheap temptation. I didn’t save money - I unlocked a new form of doom scrolling where everything costs $8 and comes with logistical stress.

Before TMS, I thought I was getting pretty decent sleep.

A city undergoing rapid change: Addis AbabaPhoto: Li Yahui/imago

From

 [Eva Behrendt](https://taz.de/Eva-Behrendt/!a34915/)

So, who does the child belong to now? The young farm worker Grusche, who rescued and raised it amidst the chaos of a coup – or the wealthy widow who gave birth to it? On the stage of the Hager Fikir Theatre in Addis Ababa, Estifanos Kebede's wily judge Azdak first pockets bribes before making both women and the child step into a circle drawn with chalk: Whoever pulls the boy out first wins. The biological and social mothers each grab an arm, but Yodit Asefa's Grusche quickly lets go.

For Bertolt Brecht, the matter was clear: the more socially responsible mother, the one deemed more responsible, would have the child. The 66-year-old director Manyazawal Endeshaw studied theater studies in East Berlin in the late 1980s. After the fall of the communist Derg regime in 1991, he twice directed the National Theater in Addis Ababa, once in the 1990s and again until the beginning of this year. ""The Caucasian Chalk Circle"" is the second Brecht play he has translated into Amharic and is now staging with financial and professional support from the Goethe-Institut and the Italian-German dramaturge Laura Olivi. For the verdict, Manyazawal makes a different, conciliatory proposal: his Azdak decides that in the future, both mothers will share responsibility for the child – with money, love, and practical accountability.

What justice means in times of upheaval is a highly charged question in the Ethiopian capital. After the imperial era under Haile Selassie and the Derg regime under Mengistu Mariam, the EPDRF (Ethiopian Revolutionary Democratic People's Front) advocated for a federal democratic republic and the strengthening of the various ethnic groups in the multi-ethnic state in 1991 – with the consequence that these groups continue to rebel against the central government in Addis Ababa to this day. Currently, the national army is fighting regional militias in the Amhara, Oromo, and parts of Tigray regions; the [Tigray War](https://taz.de/Bremer-Solidaritaetspreis-/!6112776/) (2020–2022) has already claimed the lives of around half a million people. In addition to the ethnic conflicts, there are enormous social disparities between urban and rural areas, rich and poor, and Orthodox Christians and Muslims, which are also reflected in the rapid modernization of the capital. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who took office in 2018 as a reformer, is acting with increasing authoritarianism.

His transformation of the 3.5-million-strong metropolis of Addis Ababa is proceeding at a pace that leaves even architects speechless. The ambitious president's ongoing ""Corridor Development Project,"" supported by Addis's first female mayor, Adanech Abebe, is reminiscent of the ""Haussmannization"" of Paris in the 19th century. Back then, Napoleon III had wide thoroughfares cut through the narrow streets and a water supply network installed; now, in Addis, broad boulevards are intended to improve access to the city and streamline traffic. Above all, the metropolis, situated at 2,500 meters in the fertile highlands, is to look ""more beautiful,"" befitting its role as the political and economic hub of Africa. However, some observers believe that the gentrification of the capital is also accompanied by a social ""cleansing.""

Anyone landing in the East African metropolis for the first time will notice the multi-lane boulevard, lined with wide sidewalks and clean facades, even on the short drive from the new airport to the city center. There are even bike lanes, although I didn't see a single bicycle in six days – except for the one belonging to Angelika Eder, the director of the Goethe-Institut. Umbel-shaped streetlights in the ""Dubai style"" illuminate not only the brand-new Airport Road but can also be found on all the inner-city boulevards. In the government district, elaborately irrigated and guarded parks like Unity Park and Friendship Park have dominated for the past few years. Here, as well as in the districts of Kazanchis and Piassa, tens of thousands of people, from internally displaced persons to the middle class, have already been relocated to high-rise buildings on the outskirts – with profound consequences for their established neighborhoods and micro-economies.

# Theatre with imperial box

And there are consequences for culture as well. While Manyazawal's ensemble is in the final stages of rehearsals at the Hager Fikir, Africa's oldest indigenous theater founded in 1935, director Rahel Teshome shows me the National Theater. The modernist building was originally planned as a cinema during the Italian occupation and converted into a theater under Haile Selassie in the 1950s. Like the city's Hager Fikir, it's showing its age, even though magnificent foyers, an imperial box, and over 1,200 seats hint at better days; the new stage building under construction next door is still just a concrete skeleton. In fact, the theater has been struggling with low audience numbers since the pandemic. Added to this is the urban transformation: ""Previously, mainly people from the immediate vicinity went to the National Theater. Now they live on the outskirts of the city and it takes them up to two hours to get here by public transport. The return journey, in particular, is too risky for many.""

But what kind of theater is performed on this modern stage? The yellowing photographs in the theater museum at the entrance to the National Theater show indigenous dance and music ensembles, as well as actors, writers, and translators. Although fascist Italy established a reign of terror in what was then Abyssinia between 1936 and 1941, killing up to 13 percent of the population in concentration camps and through the use of chemical weapons, Ethiopia is the only African country that was never colonized in the classical sense and therefore never subjected to a European culture.

# European theatrical influences

Alongside traditional theatrical practices, Ethiopians also imported theatrical forms from the diaspora at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1921, Fitawrari Teklehawariat Teklemariam, who had trained in Russia, laid the foundation for Ethiopian drama with the first Amharic play: his satirical animal fable ""Fabula"" premiered at the Terrace Hotel and was promptly banned by Empress Tsevditu. Although there is officially no censorship authority and freedom of expression is enshrined in the constitution, the state cultural and tourism bureau still interferes in theater and film productions, theater professionals who prefer to remain anonymous tell me.

""Eclectic"" is a favorite word of architect Maheder Gebremedhin. Selecting the best elements from various styles or schools of thought and combining them into something uniquely new could be the motto of Manyazawal's captivating interpretation of Brecht, interwoven with dance and song, as well as of Ethiopian architecture with its Armenian, Indian, Greek, and Italian influences. I meet Gebremedhin for coffee; during our conversation, he makes four phone calls. In between, he waxes lyrical about the anonymity and potential of large cities. He also finds their transformation inevitable, noting that gentrification is already evident in Berlin and New York. Nevertheless, he intends to remain critical. To that end, he founded the Urban Center at Meskelplatz. In the discussion space ""Kebet Eske Ketema"" (""From House to City""), urban planners, architects, and sociologists observe the rapid pace of change; he himself produces his own radio show there. Two colleagues guide me through the ground-floor rooms, which are arranged like honeycombs. Right next door: a huge construction site.

The government's ""Riverside Project"" aims to transform the banks of the rivers that flow through Addis Ababa into climate-resilient recreational areas, complete with steps for relaxation, clean water, and greenery. The women from the Urban Center don't mind that the rivers are no longer being used as sewers. However, they doubt that the development is based on a well-thought-out plan: ""Right here in front of us, a concrete embankment has already been built and torn down three times. You'd almost think we live in a rich country and can afford such waste,"" one of them remarks sarcastically.

How Abiy Ahmed is financing the modernization and beautification programs in Addis Ababa is an interesting question. Undoubtedly, Chinese and Indian loans play a significant role. Narendra Modi, for example, is currently visiting the city. In his honor, the Ethiopian Commercial Bank is illuminated in the Indian national colors, and his image is displayed on countless screens on lampposts and at intersections. Furthermore, Ethiopia is part of China's Belt and Road Initiative, also known as the New Silk Road. Within this framework, loans totaling approximately US$8.7 billion are said to have already flowed into the East African country; Chinese construction companies are often involved in the project implementation. Generally, many African states appreciate Asian lending policies, especially since, unlike those of the EU, they are not tied to moral requirements.

In the west of the city lies Addis Ababa's true energy center. Merkato, the largest market on the continent, stretches across an area of ​​approximately 120 hectares. Over 7,000 registered traders run businesses here – in market halls, shopping centers, or at individual stalls. In addition, there are countless street vendors who travel by bus from the countryside into the city each morning, offering only what they can carry – ginger roots, paper bags, incense stones, a sack of counterfeit brand-name shoes. It's a chaotic, bustling scene, encompassing entire landscapes of recycled materials. Traveling along the unpaved streets, you're immediately swept along by the flow of people and donkeys carrying loads, suddenly finding yourself in the middle of midday prayers, where hundreds of traders prostrate themselves on the pavement, but you also get the best, freshly roasted coffee in the metropolis – still the most important export of Ethiopia's economy, which is growing at an above-average rate of around 7 percent.

# Museum visit as a luxury

Informal structures like those found in Merkato, though not as densely packed, used to permeate the entire city center. When curator Abel Assefa picks me up at the entrance to Friendship Park, the 35-year-old tells me about the slum that once stretched across this area and disappeared as part of urban renewal efforts. Now, visitors have to pay an entrance fee: 100 birr (60 cents) for the park with its playgrounds and sports fields, and 50 birr for the Yimtubezina Museum, which Assefa manages. With an average monthly income of 2,500 birr in the city, this is hardly affordable for many.

The Yimtubezima Museum is housed in a small building that is ancient by Addis Ababa standards. Around 1900, a wealthy businesswoman commissioned Indian builders to construct it; today it belongs to her descendants, who were apparently not so easily dispossessed. Currently, the museum's focus is on the ""Birillé,"" an Erlenmeyer-flask-like glass vessel from which the traditional honey wine Tej is drunk. Using this everyday object, Assefa can tell the economic and cultural history of his country in a different way – from the imperial era to the present day.

But aren't museums essentially a European concept of the Enlightenment, one that only partially fits the African continent? Abel Assefa believes: ""Decolonization is important, but we need local museums here."" He regularly attends training courses in Europe and applies his knowledge in Addis Ababa in his own unique way. His exhibition is meticulously planned; moreover, he commissioned paintings and replicas on the theme from three artists, thus also strengthening the local art scene. In comparison, the National Museum's room, which houses some of the oldest human skeletons in existence, seems somewhat unimaginative with its overload of explanatory panels. However, during the hour I spend with Abel Assefa at the Yimtubezima, I am also the only visitor.

# Living room jazz in a private club

It's striking that most ""cultural centers"" originate from private initiatives. This is also true of what is perhaps Addis Ababa's most vibrant and lively live music venue besides Merkato: the Fendika music club. Every Monday, the renowned band KaynLab, featuring jazz legend Henock Temesgen on bass, performs here in front of a kind of living-room-style wall unit filled with books, vinyl records, consumer electronics from the waning days of the analog era, and a traditional plucked harp, the krar. As a warm-up, however, Fendika's owner, Melaku Belay, first spins records from his [Ethio-jazz collection](https://taz.de/Mulatu-Astatke-Erfahrung-und-Weisheit/!6112093/) of the 1960s and 70s, which he has arranged around him like an altar. With a broad grin, he greets arriving guests—many young Ethiopians, expats, and tourists—and constantly pours drinks, the mead, of course, served in birillé glasses.

Melaku Belay comes from humble beginnings; as a young man, he was homeless for a time. He took a job at Fendika, one of the many Azmari Bets (music venues) that characterized the Kazanchi district at the time; later, he took over the tent-like corrugated iron structure. He introduced fixed salaries for musicians and dancers who, like himself, had previously lived solely on tips. During the 2000s and 2010s, most of these venues disappeared from the cityscape, but Fendika survived thanks to Belay, who has not only toured halfway around the world as a dancer with his indigenous band, but is also a charismatic networker. And Ethiopia's first TED Talker: In his talk, the artist explained, among other things, how much Merkato is present in his ecstatic movement improvisations.

But in October 2024, he too received a demolition notice. Belay did manage to strike a deal with the Hyatt Hotel on Meskel Square. The cultural center has found temporary refuge in its still diesel-scented basement; there's also space for contemporary art exhibitions and restaurants. But Belay wants to return to the original location, has already convinced the city council, and has secured an Italian architectural firm for the design. However, he needs to demonstrate $1.25 million in donations for the project, enough money (theoretically) to build a twenty-story high-rise – as stipulated by the zoning plan.

It’s important that you remember that just because something has protein in it doesn't mean it’s healthy… it only means that, well, it has protein.

You should still pay attention to the other values, like sugar and fats, and remember that it is all about consuming your daily macros, and that no because you eat more protein you’re going to build more muscle or loose more fat…

Some of these food can be nice to have if you struggle to reach your daily protein goal, but I find that many of these foods are actually high in calories and the amount of protein in them is not that high.

Personally I like the 1:10 rule, meaning at least 1g of protein per 10 calories. My go to protein bar is the Barebells White Chocolate Almond (or any Barebells flavor but white chocolate is my personal favorite). And please don't falls for “protein” scams such as the Protein poptarts… just because the added a huge Protein banner on the box, it doesn't make them a high protein and much less healthy snack (only 10g protein for 380cal).",21,1768311838.0,1200isplenty,14,0.86,False

For the longest time, physics felt like trying to read a textbook written in alien glyphs, especially when we hit special relativity. I mean, time *slowing down*? Light speed as an absolute constant? My brain just kept hitting a wall, hard. I'd stare at Lorentz transformations until my eyes blurred, but it was all just squiggly lines on a page, devoid of any real meaning.

I was so frustrated, feeling like I was the only one in class who just *wasn't getting it*. The numbers were there, the formulas were sound, but the intuitive leap, the 'aha!' moment everyone talks about, was just nowhere to be found. It felt like trying to grasp a slippery fish in the dark. I genuinely thought I was just not built for this kind of thinking.

Then, one dreary Tuesday, I was on my usual commute, rattling along in a slightly grubby train carriage. I was just zoning out, watching the blur of the outside world, when I saw someone slowly walking *against* the direction of the train towards the back. And it hit me like a bolt of lightning, right there, amidst the rhythmic click-clack of the wheels and the faint smell of stale coffee.

Their speed relative to *me*, sitting there on the ground (well, relatively on the ground in the train), was clearly different from their speed relative to the *train itself*. And then, suddenly, the implications of light speed being constant for all observers, no matter their motion, snapped into place. It wasn't about things *actually* moving faster or slower in some absolute sense, but about how different observers, moving at different relative velocities, *perceive* time and space.

It was like a mental dam bursting, flooding my mind with crystal-clear understanding. The world suddenly felt so much more interconnected, and simultaneously, so much more mind-bendingly relative. My head was spinning, not from confusion, but from the sheer, exhilarating wonder of it all. It was the most profound 'ohhhhhhh, *that's* what they mean!' moment of my life.

1qbrlgq,https://v.redd.it/gy9ax97je4dg1,What’s really going on with office politics (and how do you decode it)?,"Reading the hidden system at work so your effort actually counts

Framing the real question

Most of us bump into office politics and think, “Ugh, drama.” But what’s really going on is a hidden system of power, relationships, and incentives that sits underneath job titles and org charts. If you learn to read that system—office politics, workplace politics, company politics—you stop being blindsided and start understanding why certain ideas fly while others quietly die.
The deeper question is this: how can you decode that system without becoming fake or manipulative? In this post, we’ll walk through how office politics actually work, how to spot the invisible rules in your environment, and how to navigate them in a way that still feels like you.

Seeing the hidden system behind office politics

The loud version of office politics is gossip, cliques, and power plays. The real version is quieter: it’s how decisions get made, how information flows, and whose priorities shape what actually happens.

Think of your workplace like a city:

The org chart is the official map—streets, districts, rules.
Office politics are the traffic patterns—where things clog, where shortcuts exist, where everything mysteriously speeds up.
If you only look at the map, you’ll be confused when a five-minute drive takes 30. If you learn the traffic, the city suddenly makes sense.

At a practical level, decoding office politics means paying attention to three things:

Influence: Who shapes outcomes, beyond titles?
Interests: What do people really care about, beyond slogans?
Informal routes: Where do real decisions happen—calendar meetings or side conversations?
Once you notice these three, the “randomness” at work starts looking much more predictable.

How to decode office politics without going dark

You don’t have to become sneaky to understand workplace politics; you have to become observant. Start with behaviors, not stories.

1. Watch how decisions actually move

Instead of asking, “Who’s in charge?”, ask:

Whose approval do people seek before moving forward?
Who can quietly block an idea, even if they don’t own the project?
When something “urgent” appears, who is it really urgent for?
This helps you see the informal chain of command. Titles might say one thing; behavior tells you who really carries weight.

2. Map motivations, not just personalities

It’s easy to label people—“political,” “difficult,” “power-hungry.” More useful is asking:

What are they optimizing for? (Safety, status, speed, control, impact?)
What are they afraid of? (Blame, irrelevance, missing targets?)
What do they need to show their own boss? (Wins, stability, innovation?)
When you see motivations, their moves stop feeling random or personal. You realize, “Oh, they’re not blocking me—they’re protecting themselves.” That insight alone lowers stress.

3. Trace the informal networks

Office politics are often just informal networks doing their thing. Notice:

Who regularly eats lunch together or hops on quick calls?
Who gets looped into early drafts versus final versions?
Who tends to be a translator between teams (“Let me explain how they think”)?
These are the social highways of your company. If you’re always off the highway, your work travels slower.

A real-world example: same role, different trajectory

Picture two product managers, Sam and Riley, both talented, both hardworking. A new initiative launches, and leadership needs someone to own a high-visibility feature.

Sam’s approach:
Focuses on executing the current roadmap.
Avoids “politics” by skipping cross-functional coffees and stakeholder chats.
Hears about big decisions in formal meetings and reacts in real time.
Riley’s approach:
Pays attention to who keeps getting quoted in leadership updates.
Asks in 1:1s, “What’s the most important outcome for you this quarter?”
Notices that ops is worried about support load and that sales is hungry for a story they can tell customers.
Before the big planning meeting, Riley informally shares a draft idea with ops and sales, tweaks it based on their input, and makes sure they feel seen.
In the planning meeting, both pitch solid ideas. But Riley’s idea already has visible support; key stakeholders are nodding because their needs were baked in. Leadership reads that as “Riley is strategic and collaborative” and gives Riley the flagship feature.

From the outside, it might look like favoritism or random luck. From the inside, it’s office politics—understood and navigated thoughtfully.

Playing office politics ethically (yes, it’s possible)

The trap is thinking you only have two choices:

Opt out and be “pure,” hoping your work speaks for itself, or
Opt in and become a schemer.
There’s a third path: be politically aware and values-driven.

That looks like:

Building relationships before you need them. A quick “Hey, I’d love to understand what matters most to your team this quarter” goes a long way.
Sharing credit generously. “This wouldn’t have happened without X’s push on Y” is both true and politically smart.
Giving your manager a clear narrative. Short, concrete updates turn them into an advocate instead of a bottleneck.
Choosing your battles. If you say “this is a hill I’ll die on” once a month, no one listens. If you reserve it for real stakes, your voice matters more.
A simple ethical filter:

Would I be comfortable if everyone knew I did this, and why?

If the answer is yes, you’re likely navigating politics, not manipulating people.

Bringing it together: decoding the game without losing yourself

What’s really going on with office politics is simple: people with different incentives are sharing a system with limited attention, resources, and time. The “political” part is just how those differences play out. When you learn to decode who influences what, what they care about, and how decisions really flow, you stop feeling like the game is rigged against you.

You don’t have to become someone else; you just have to stop flying blind. For the next few weeks, treat your workplace like a case study: observe, map, ask curious questions, and experiment with how you position your work and your relationships. Notice what changes.

If you want to keep sharpening the kinds of questions that make you more effective—not just busier—consider following QuestionClass’s Question-a-Day at questionclass.com and turning question-asking into a daily practice.

🧬 QuestionStrings to Practice

“QuestionStrings are deliberately ordered sequences of questions in which each answer fuels the next, creating a compounding ladder of insight that drives progressively deeper understanding. What to do now: use this to decode the political landscape around one important project you care about.”

The Office Politics Decoder String

For when you feel there’s a “game” being played and you’re not sure of the rules:

“Whose opinion can meaningfully change the outcome here?” →
“What is each of those people trying hard not to lose—status, time, control, credibility, budget?” →
“Who quietly shapes their thinking behind the scenes?” →
“What would a win that feels safe and attractive to this group look like?” →
“What relationship or conversation, started this week, would make that win more likely?”

Try using this in your next planning cycle or big decision. Over time, you’ll move from guessing to genuinely understanding the politics around you.

Learning to read office politics is less about playing games and more about finally seeing the game you’ve been in all along—and using that insight to do work you’re proud of, that actually moves.",1,1768311693.0,QuestionClass,0,1.0,False
1qbrkiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TikTokMarketing/comments/1qbrkiq/wheres_the_best_place_to_buy_tiktok/,Where’s the best place to buy TikTok followers/likes? My honest experience (no gatekeeping),"Yo! I know this is a controversial topic, but let’s be real for a second. We’ve all been there—you spend 3 hours editing a transition, post it, and it gets 212 views and 2 likes. It’s hard to build a community when your profile looks like a ghost town.

I decided to run a little experiment on a secondary account to see if buying a few followers/likes actually helps ""prime the pump"" or if it’s just a waste of money. Here’s what I learned as a creator:

**The ""200 View"" Struggle is Real** I’ve found that the TikTok algorithm is way more likely to push your stuff to the FYP if you already have some social proof. People are just more likely to follow someone who already has 1k followers than someone with 12. It’s psychological.

**The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly** I tried three different spots to see what happened:

* **The Cheap Sites:** I tried one of those ""get 10k followers for a coffee"" sites. Huge mistake. They all had weird usernames like *user837492* and no profile pics. TikTok deleted most of them within 48 hours. Waste of money.
* **The ""Premium"" Services:** I tried a few of the big names you see on Google. They were okay, but the followers felt a bit... stagnant?
* **Fologrow:** Honestly, this was the sweet spot for me. I used them for a small boost (about 500 followers and some likes on my latest three videos) and it actually looked natural. The accounts had profile pictures and posts, and more importantly, they stayed. It gave my profile enough ""clout"" that my organic videos started performing better because new viewers actually took me seriously.

**My ""Creator"" Strategy:** If you’re gonna do it, don't be obvious.

1. **Don't overdo it:** If you have 0 followers, don't buy 50k. Start with 500 or 1,000.
2. **Match your stats:** If you buy followers, grab a few likes too so your engagement ratio doesn't look broken.
3. **Quality > Quantity:** Use a site like Fologrow that actually uses high-quality accounts. It’s better to have 100 followers that look real than 10,000 that look like bots.

At the end of the day, you still need to make good content, but a little boost at the start can definitely help get you over the hump.

This handy guide will give a detailed description with some tips for these encounters!

I recommend equipping Omori with his Hikikomori-exclusive skills (""VERTIGO"", ""SUFFOCATE"", ""CRIPPLE"", ""RED HANDS""). Basil obviously has no selectable skills, but his main attack changes depending on his equipped charm. I believe the Flower Crown is generally recommended, giving him his own equivalant to Red Hands.

I recommend buying a bunch of Whole Chickens and Melon Smoothies from the mailbox demon near the Boss Rush counter. (The versions you can find at Dino Dig are technically better, but not worth grinding for). It may be also be worth it to head back to the fast food place at the Underwater Highway and get some Combo Meals for when a single character takes a big hit. The Snow-Cones from Otherworld will also be useful, but those are very expensive so it may not be worth it.

\&nbsp;

#\*\*AUBREY, KEL & HERO\*\*

These three characters have a greater variety of skills than regular bosses.

KEL:

\*\*Attack\*\* - deals low damage to a character

\*\*Run N' Gun\*\* - deals high damage to a character

\*\*Ricochet\*\* - attacks three times, dealing high damage to a character.

\*\*Curveball\*\* - deals low damage to a character and randomly changes their Emotion. (If the character already has any emotion, this deals high damage instead)

\*\*Flex\*\* - increases damage and hit rate for Kel's next attack.

\*\*Tickle\*\* - Kel's next attack will always deal a critical hit.

\*\*Annoy\*\* - makes a character ANGRY

\*\*Rain Cloud\*\* - makes both characters SAD

AUBREY:

\*\*Attack\*\* - deals low damage to a character

\*\*Beatdown\*\* - attacks two times, dealing minor damage to a character

\*\*Mood Wrecker\*\* - deals moderate damage to a character. (If the character is HAPPY, this deals high damage instead)

\*\*Twirl\*\* - deals moderate damage to an ANGRY character. Aubrey becomes HAPPY.

\*\*Power Hit\*\* - deals high damage to a character and decreases their defense.

\*\*Wind-up Throw\*\* - deals moderate damage to all characters, or high damage to Omori if Basil is down.

\*\*Pep talk\*\* - makes another enemy HAPPY

HERO:

\*\*Attack\*\* - deals low damage to a character

\*\*Cook\*\* - heals about 20% of Hero's or another enemy's HP

\*\*Coffee\*\* - greatly increases another enemy's speed. Only works once per enemy.

\*\*Smile\*\* - reduces a character's attack.

\*\*Dazzle\*\* - reduces both character's attack and makes them HAPPY

\*\*Spicy Food\*\* - deals low damage to a character and makes them ANGRY

\&nbsp;

Around the start of the battle, Kel will deal a single-time instant kill attack. You'll know it's coming when he flexes and is fed coffee. This is so overpowered that defending won't help, but the skill is less of a problem when targeting Omori, who will remain at 1 HP and can easily be healed back up during the next turn. I think you ultimately just have to be lucky.

As a general strategy, you should start with Omori's stat-reducing skills (VERTIGO is the most important) to weaken the enemies, but note that these only work once. You should also feed both Omori and Basil a Snow-cone as soon as you can if you have them (once again, these only work once, so don't waste turns trying to spam them).

Red Hands and Flower Crown will be your main skills throughout this fight. Although Basil has a decent healing skill, I suggest using items to heal so you won't find yourself low on Juice when you really need it. Keep your eye on the Energy meter, and use Omori to Release Energy the moment it reaches 10. This provides a free full heal and deals a decent amount of damage.

Because Kel has the strongest attacks, you should focus on taking him down first. Hero will heal him occasionally, but this isn't very strong. Once Kel is dead, focus on Aubrey. When you're done beating up that little girl, Hero will amusingly be unable to really do anything. Defeat him and it'll be time to move on to the next battle.

\&nbsp;

#\*\*MARI\*\*

This battle is gonna be pretty tough. Once again, make sure you're stocked up on Whole Chickens and Melon Smoothies. The boss doesn't have \\\*that\\\* much health, but her attacks are pretty vicious if you get unlucky.

The start of this battle is very simple. Mari will offer some fruit from her basket, which heals both Omori and Basil, but she'll mostly just stand there. Don't bother changing your emotion at this point, because she'll probably remove it the next turn. You should take this opportunity to use VERTIGO, SUFFOCATE and CRIPPLE to lower Mari's stats. If you have any Snow-cones, make sure to use those as well.

When she reaches 90% HP, she'll enter her infamous \*\*\*Mari Rage\*\*\* phase. You'll notice the music and background changing, and Mari will become ANGRY. She'll throw her basket onto the ground, and Basil will reach down to grab some free healing items. You'll get the following:

Grapes x3 - heals a moderate amount to both characters.

Apple x4 - heals a low amount to one character, basically useless

Orange x2 - deals a high amount to a character

Banana x2 - heals a minor amount to a character. They'll throw the peel on the ground afterwards and make Mari slip and fall, dealing a moderate amount of damage. Practically only useful if you're entirely out of JUICE on the current turn.

Lemon x1 - using this will squeeze lemon juice into Mari's eyes, blinding her for one turn (any attacks she tries will miss). Honestly not very useful unless you're very close to dying.

From this point onwards, Mari's emotion can no longer be changed. Using an emotion-changing skill will only prompt the text ""but MARI wasn't listening!"". Using an item results in the text ""MARI took the \\\[SPARKLER/POETRY BOOK/PRESENT\\\] and tore it to pieces!"" and will similarly have no effect. (...how exactly would you rip up a sparkler? It'd burn your hands.)

\&nbsp;

During this phase, Mari will randomly pick one of the following attacks:

\*\*Punch\*\* - Mari beats a character, dealing low damage

\*\*Bash Away\*\* - Mari punches a character in the face repeatedly, attacking four times and dealing moderate damage.

\*\*Picnic Time\*\* - Mari picks up her picnic basket and throws it at the party, dealing minor damage to everyone.

\*\*Body Slam\*\* - Mari picks up Basil and throws him at Omori, dealing moderate damage to the former and minor damage to the latter. This attack decreases Basil speed.

\*\*Curb Stomp\*\* - Mari shoves a character to the ground and starts stomping away as she is known to love doing, dealing relatively high damage. Mari will always become HAPPY for one turn after using this.

\*\*Bite\*\* - Mari clenches her teeth into a character and rips off a chunk of skin, dealing moderate-to-high damage, decreasing their defense and causing a ""bleed"" effect for 3 turns. Thankfully, this has a low chance of being picked.

\*\*Do Nothing\*\* - this only has a 1% chance of being picked during this phase, so you probably won't see it. The phrase ""MARI is foaming at the mouth."" would appear in a textbox, but nothing else happens.

\&nbsp;

When Mari reaches 25% HP, the phrase ""MARI is hungry...!"" will appear and she'll have a scripted attack. Mari will lunge at a character, gouge out their eyes and gobble them down. She only heals a minor amount of HP, but this will permanently blind the character for the rest of the battle. Any offensive attacks will miss, meaning they're reduced to an assist-based character. It's unclear if Basil's ""Photograph"" skill affects this. I think you'll just have to hope she won't pick Omori.

When Mari's done eating, you'll enter the third phase. Mari will now act twice per turn. Three new attacks will be introduced.

\*\*Makeover\*\* - Mari scratches at a character's face with her nails, dealing moderate damage and causing a bleed effect.

\*\*Suffocate\*\* - Mari puts her hands around a character's throat and chokes them out, dealing low damage but making them unavailable for the next turn.

\*\*Kick\*\* - Mari kicks a character very hard, dealing high damage.

\&nbsp;

When she reaches 90% HP, she'll start acting three times per turn. However, the rate of \*\*""do nothing""\*\* is increased to 50%. The messages ""MARI is shaking"", ""MARI's eyes are bloodshot"", ""MARI is breathing heavily"" and ""MARI is covered in sweat"" may now also be displayed.

When Mari reaches 0% HP, she'll drop to the ground and stop fighting back. You'll have to keep attacking for a few more turns until she stops moving and dies.


And with that, you'll have beaten the BOSS RUSH! You have proven yourself as the ultimate warrior. Congratulations!",1,1768311537.0,OMORI,0,1.0,False

This morning, while I(29M) was making coffee, she showed me a listing and asked why people were posting “bundle” offers and “flash sale” stuff. I, in my infinite wisdom, said, “Oh, you just aren’t using the Deals tab. It shows the trending cheap listings nearby. It’s amazing.”

  
I then proceeded to demonstrate like some kind of minimalist influencer, except the opposite. I set her filters to our neighborhood, showed her how to favorite sellers, and explained notifications so she wouldn’t “miss a good one.” I felt helpful. Supportive. A hero.

  
Fast forward to tonight. She(28F) gets home from work looking absolutely drained, holding her phone like it personally betrayed her. She said, “I have been scrolling deals all day. All day. I bought a rug we do not need because it was the price of two coffees. I also committed to picking up a vintage lamp tomorrow at 7:15 a.m. from a guy who only communicates in thumbs-up emojis.”

  
Now our living room has a mystery rug on the way, our schedule has a dawn pickup appointment, and she’s overwhelmed by an endless feed of cheap temptation. I didn’t save money - I unlocked a new form of doom scrolling where everything costs $8 and comes with logistical stress.

  
TL;DR: I(29M) showed my partner(28F) the “Deals” section of a resale app and accidentally turned her day into nonstop bargain scrolling and unnecessary purchases.",0,1768311534.0,tifu,3,0.09,False

Watch the video below:

# What Is Google Stitch Gemini 3 Flash?

Here’s the deal.

**Google Stitch** is a no-code design tool that turns text prompts into real app and website designs.

You just type what you want — like “make me an e-commerce homepage” — and Stitch gives you full screens with HTML, CSS, and even Figma files.

No coding.

No design skills needed.

Now Google just plugged in **Gemini 3 Flash**, and it’s made everything 10x faster.

Before this update, you’d wait around for each design.

Now it’s instant.

You can test 10 ideas in the time it used to take for one.

That’s what makes this update so powerful.



# Why Gemini 3 Flash Is a Game-Changer

Gemini 3 Flash is Google’s speed model.

It’s built for lightning-fast design generation with solid quality.

This means every layout, color scheme, and UI mockup now renders in seconds.

You can go from idea to full design before your coffee gets cold.

And that’s not just a flex — it’s the start of true **AI-first design workflows**.

When you pair Gemini 3 Flash with Stitch, you get a creative playground where iteration is instant.

Speed means exploration.

Exploration means better results.



# Design Speed: Days vs Minutes

Let’s put it in perspective.

Before Gemini 3 Flash, designing a homepage could take days.

Now it takes minutes.

You open Stitch, describe your design, get multiple versions instantly, refine what you like, and export to Figma or code.

That’s it.

You’ve just replaced an entire design sprint with a single conversation.

That’s why **Google Stitch Gemini 3 Flash** isn’t just an update — it’s a new way of building.



# How The Google Stitch Workflow Works

You start with a simple prompt.

Something like: “Design a mobile fitness tracker app.”

Stitch generates your first design.

Don’t like the layout? Ask it to change.

Make it darker.

Add a menu.

Move the button.

Gemini 3 Flash updates everything in seconds.

This is called iterative design.

You’re not locked into one version anymore — you can branch off, explore new styles, and converge on what works.

That’s how professionals build, and now anyone can do it.



# Gemini 3 Flash vs Pro: Which One Should You Use?

Inside Stitch, you’ll see two model options — Flash and Pro.

Pro is slower but thinks deeper.

It’s great for logic-heavy workflows and advanced reasoning.

**Flash is your creative accelerator.**

Use it when you’re brainstorming, testing, and exploring new ideas.

Switch back to Pro for fine-tuning final designs.

Start fast, then refine smart.

That’s the magic combo.



# Real-World Use Cases of Google Stitch Gemini 3 Flash

Here’s how creators are already using it:

* Brainstorming layouts in seconds.
* Trying light mode vs dark mode instantly.
* Testing 10 navigation menus before choosing one.
* Generating prototypes for clients in 3 minutes.
* Exporting HTML and Figma files ready for production.

It’s not about design theory anymore.

It’s about execution speed.



# Why Speed Wins

Speed is leverage.

With **Google Stitch Gemini 3 Flash**, you can test, iterate, and build faster than ever.

When each design takes 10 seconds, you don’t overthink.

You experiment.

You find what works.

That’s the new advantage.

Every business that moves faster wins.

This update gives you that edge.

# Practical Example: Designing an E-commerce Homepage

Here’s a simple workflow you can try.

Prompt: “Design an e-commerce homepage for selling sneakers.”

Gemini 3 Flash instantly generates a full design — header, hero section, product grid, and footer.

Want to tweak it?

Ask it to make the hero bigger.

Try a new color palette.

Generate a mobile version.

Export to Figma.

Done.

That’s a full professional design in under 3 minutes.

It’s for everyone.

Early on, I worked from coffee shops and coworking spaces a lot, but now I almost never do, maybe once or twice in the past year.

The main reason is my setup. At home I use two large external monitors, and honestly… working on just a laptop screen (or even with a travel monitor) feels like a massive downgrade in productivity. The travel monitor also takes up a ton of space and feels like more trouble than it’s worth in public places.

Here’s where I’m torn:
Part of me thinks getting out of the house and being around other people would be better for my mental health and focus. I get distracted at home and sometimes feel isolated or low. But every time I try to justify going somewhere else, the productivity hit feels hard to ignore.

So I’m curious, is working around other people actually worth being less productive?
Do you prioritize environment and energy, or an optimal setup and efficiency?
Or is working from home with a “perfect” setup just the endgame for remote work?

Would love to hear where people land on this.

As part of her bail conditions, Tan was instructed by the authorities not to check into accommodations such as hotels, motels, or hostels in Singapore while she was out on bail.

But after Dec. 22, 2023, she reoffended at several hotels with the same modus operandi.

On Mar. 28, 2024, at the Peninsular Excelsior Singapore, she checked into a room, then left the hotel at about 8:59pm with one large carrier bag containing items valued at S$3,108.68.

They included a curtain, a table lamp, a coffee mug and spoon, duvets, and towels.

When confronted by the duty manager, she lied that her friend had taken the items, but eventually paid fully for what she stole.

The stolen items were not recovered, though, as Tan claimed that she did not know where she had kept them at home.

On Mar. 13, 2024, at about 6.23pm, at the State Courts, Tan stole a whiteboard valued at S$2.

Could not control herself

On Sep. 3, 2024, after another theft at Holiday Inn Express Singapore Serangoon, the police arrested Tan again.

She said she was aware of her bail conditions, but claimed that she was unable to control herself.

She threw a bed sheet she stole from the hotel down the rubbish chute at her house, as she was afraid that her mother would discover it.

""The remaining stolen items were stored in the accused’s house but they could not be found as the accused is a hoarder and her house is full of items,"" the prosecution said.

On Oct. 16, 2024, the prosecution called for a sentence of 4 – 5 months in prison, but she was instead placed under Mandatory Treatment Order (MTO) for 24 months with effect from that day.

Fresh offences

While serving her MTO, Tan stole from four more hotels: Novotel Singapore on Kitchener Road, Four Points by Sheraton, The Robertson House, and Conrad Hotel.

The most recent of these offences was on Feb. 15, 2025, at The Robertson House, where she took a table lamp, bed bolster, telephone, and clothes hangers worth S$951.

For these four thefts, Tan has not returned any of the items and has not made any restitution to date.

Psychiatric assessment

According to the prosecution, the IMH completed a forensic psychiatric report on her in December 2024, and stated that she was not of unsound mind when she committed the offences.

At the same time, IMH assessed Tan to have obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) on a background of hoarding disorder, which was in relapse at and around the time of her offences.

She claimed to have recurrent thoughts and urges that were distressing and would only be relieved by her taking certain items out of the room, the report said.

However, given her efforts to try to pay for many of the items she stole, her condition has no contributory link to the offences, both the report and the prosecution argued.

According to Shin Min, Tan's lawyer pleaded for leniency, saying her OCD made her unable to control himself, which led to the repeated offences. Furthermore, the stolen items were not expensive and were not intended for personal gain.

IMH evaluated that her risk of reoffending is moderate to high, among the reasons being a lack of regular employment.

The prosecution sought a total sentence of eight months' jail for Tan — five months for the fresh offences, and three for her breach offences — which she received on Jan. 13.",5,1768310773.0,SingaporeRaw,9,0.86,False

This handy guide will give a detailed description with some tips for these encounters!

I recommend equipping Omori with his Hikikomori-exclusive skills (""VERTIGO"", ""SUFFOCATE"", ""CRIPPLE"", ""RED HANDS""). Basil obviously has no selectable skills, but his main attack changes depending on his equipped charm. I believe the Flower Crown is generally recommended, giving him his own equivalant to Red Hands.

I recommend buying a bunch of Whole Chickens and Melon Smoothies from the mailbox demon near the Boss Rush counter. (The versions you can find at Dino Dig are technically better, but not worth grinding for). It may be also be worth it to head back to the fast food place at the Underwater Highway and get some Combo Meals for when a single character takes a big hit. The Snow-Cones from Otherworld will also be useful, but those are very expensive so it may not be worth it.

&nbsp;

#**AUBREY, KEL & HERO**

These three characters have a greater variety of skills than regular bosses.

KEL:

**Attack** - deals low damage to a character

**Run N' Gun** - deals high damage to a character

**Ricochet** - attacks three times, dealing high damage to a character.

**Curveball** - deals low damage to a character and randomly changes their Emotion. (If the character already has any emotion, this deals high damage instead)

**Flex** - increases damage and hit rate for Kel's next attack.

**Tickle** - Kel's next attack will always deal a critical hit.

**Annoy** - makes a character ANGRY

**Rain Cloud** - makes both characters SAD

AUBREY:

**Attack** - deals low damage to a character

**Beatdown** - attacks two times, dealing minor damage to a character

**Mood Wrecker** - deals moderate damage to a character. (If the character is HAPPY, this deals high damage instead)

**Twirl** - deals moderate damage to an ANGRY character. Aubrey becomes HAPPY.

**Power Hit** - deals high damage to a character and decreases their defense.

**Wind-up Throw** - deals moderate damage to all characters, or high damage to Omori if Basil is down.

**Pep talk** - makes another enemy HAPPY

HERO:

**Attack** - deals low damage to a character

**Cook** - heals about 20% of Hero's or another enemy's HP

**Coffee** - greatly increases another enemy's speed. Only works once per enemy.

**Smile** - reduces a character's attack.

**Dazzle** - reduces both character's attack and makes them HAPPY

**Spicy Food** - deals low damage to a character and makes them ANGRY

&nbsp;

Around the start of the battle, Kel will deal a single-time instant kill attack. You'll know it's coming when he flexes and is fed coffee. This is so overpowered that defending won't help, but the skill is less of a problem when targeting Omori, who will remain at 1 HP and can easily be healed back up during the next turn. I think you ultimately just have to be lucky.

As a general strategy, you should start with Omori's stat-reducing skills (VERTIGO is the most important) to weaken the enemies, but note that these only work once. You should also feed both Omori and Basil a Snow-cone as soon as you can if you have them (once again, these only work once, so don't waste turns trying to spam them).

Red Hands and Flower Crown will be your main skills throughout this fight. Although Basil has a decent healing skill, I suggest using items to heal so you won't find yourself low on Juice when you really need it. Keep your eye on the Energy meter, and use Omori to Release Energy the moment it reaches 10. This provides a free full heal and deals a decent amount of damage.

Because Kel has the strongest attacks, you should focus on taking him down first. Hero will heal him occasionally, but this isn't very strong. Once Kel is dead, focus on Aubrey. When you're done beating up that little girl, Hero will amusingly be unable to really do anything. Defeat him and it'll be time to move on to the next battle.

&nbsp;

#**MARI**

This battle is gonna be pretty tough. Once again, make sure you're stocked up on Whole Chickens and Melon Smoothies. The boss doesn't have \*that\* much health, but her attacks are pretty vicious if you get unlucky.

The start of this battle is very simple. Mari will offer some fruit from her basket, which heals both Omori and Basil, but she'll mostly just stand there. Don't bother changing your emotion at this point, because she'll probably remove it the next turn. You should take this opportunity to use VERTIGO, SUFFOCATE and CRIPPLE to lower Mari's stats. If you have any Snow-cones, make sure to use those as well.

When she reaches 90% HP, she'll enter her infamous ***Mari Rage*** phase. You'll notice the music and background changing, and Mari will become ANGRY. She'll throw her basket onto the ground, and Basil will reach down to grab some free healing items. You'll get the following:

Grapes x3 - heals a moderate amount to both characters.

Apple x4 - heals a low amount to one character, basically useless

Orange x2 - deals a high amount to a character

Banana x2 - heals a minor amount to a character. They'll throw the peel on the ground afterwards and make Mari slip and fall, dealing a moderate amount of damage. Practically only useful if you're entirely out of JUICE on the current turn.

Lemon x1 - using this will squeeze lemon juice into Mari's eyes, blinding her for one turn (any attacks she tries will miss). Honestly not very useful unless you're very close to dying.

From this point onwards, Mari's emotion can no longer be changed. Using an emotion-changing skill will only prompt the text ""but MARI wasn't listening!"". Using an item results in the text ""MARI took the \[SPARKLER/POETRY BOOK/PRESENT\] and tore it to pieces!"" and will similarly have no effect. (...how exactly would you rip up a sparkler? It'd burn your hands.)

&nbsp;

During this phase, Mari will randomly pick one of the following attacks:

**Punch** - Mari beats a character, dealing low damage

**Bash Away** - Mari punches a character in the face repeatedly, attacking four times and dealing moderate damage.

**Picnic Time** - Mari picks up her picnic basket and throws it at the party, dealing minor damage to everyone.

**Body Slam** - Mari picks up Basil and throws him at Omori, dealing moderate damage to the former and minor damage to the latter. This attack decreases Basil speed.

**Curb Stomp** - Mari shoves a character to the ground and starts stomping away as she is known to love doing, dealing relatively high damage. Mari will always become HAPPY for one turn after using this.

**Bite** - Mari clenches her teeth into a character and rips off a chunk of skin, dealing moderate-to-high damage, decreasing their defense and causing a ""bleed"" effect for 3 turns. Thankfully, this has a low chance of being picked.

**Do Nothing** - this only has a 1% chance of being picked during this phase, so you probably won't see it. The phrase ""MARI is foaming at the mouth."" would appear in a textbox, but nothing else happens.

&nbsp;

When Mari reaches 25% HP, the phrase ""MARI is hungry...!"" will appear and she'll have a scripted attack. Mari will lunge at a character, gouge out their eyes and gobble them down. She only heals a minor amount of HP, but this will permanently blind the character for the rest of the battle. Any offensive attacks will miss, meaning they're reduced to an assist-based character. It's unclear if Basil's ""Photograph"" skill affects this. I think you'll just have to hope she won't pick Omori.

When Mari's done eating, you'll enter the third phase. Mari will now act twice per turn. Three new attacks will be introduced.

**Makeover** - Mari scratches at a character's face with her nails, dealing moderate damage and causing a bleed effect.

**Suffocate** - Mari puts her hands around a character's throat and chokes them out, dealing low damage but making them unavailable for the next turn.

**Kick** - Mari kicks a character very hard, dealing high damage.

&nbsp;

When she reaches 90% HP, she'll start acting three times per turn. However, the rate of **""do nothing""** is increased to 50%. The messages ""MARI is shaking"", ""MARI's eyes are bloodshot"", ""MARI is breathing heavily"" and ""MARI is covered in sweat"" may now also be displayed.

When Mari reaches 0% HP, she'll drop to the ground and stop fighting back. You'll have to keep attacking for a few more turns until she stops moving and dies.


And with that, you'll have beaten the BOSS RUSH! You have proven yourself as the ultimate warrior. Congratulations!",3,1768310670.0,Omorimemes,1,1.0,False

1qbr6go,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1qbr6go/the_gods_among_us_edit_and_repost/,The Gods Among Us - edit and repost,"It is not unusual to have Gods.

Most - if not all - of the sapient races did at one time or another.

What was unusual however, was how completely the humans *kept* their gods.

Don’t get it confused. There was not one human religion, there were millions.

There were atheists who worship no gods at all, and thought the whole thing was rather silly, monotheists who worshiped one *and only one* god, and get sniffy about all the others, and people who worshiped a whole pantheon of gods of all different shapes, sizes and colors.

People who worshiped nature.

People who worshiped their ancestors.

People who worshiped their system’s star.

Humans were unique in their belief though. They brought their gods with them. I meant that figuratively of course. But... also literally. Humans would talk about how their gods followed them, coming along - sometimes to help, sometimes not. They spoke of them as if they were right there with them.

And friends, I swear I saw them too.

One time, we were between the stars and our FlashWarp drive failed. I don't know the details behind the why of it, I was onboard as a passenger. We were two days without our drive and thoroughly stuck.

On this trip, quite a few of the passengers were human. I had seen them before in passing, but never up close before. Short and stout, their bodies announced their originating planet. A dangerous, difficult, high gravity world. They were strong and clever and built to survive.

Some carried little trinkets and charms too. Little pieces of metal, or plastic in small shapes. During the evening meal, I had asked one of them about it, and they had mentioned that it was a sign of their religion.

""Religion? As in worshiping the supernatural?""

""Well, technically, I suppose. It's much more personal for me than something academic sounding like that."" They smiled and used their delicate digits to manipulate the little charm while they spoke. ""Humanity has had religion a long, long time. I understand that many Confederation races had it also at one point, but most decided to put it away as they ventured out into space, correct?""

I nodded. It was fascinating to hear the conversation. I had never spoken with a human this much before. Her accent was impeccable and her voice was musical. Did all humans sound like this?

She continued. ""Humans - those who Believe - bring that with them in what they do, who they are. That's not to say that Atheists are bad or wrong, or people who follow different gods are bad or wrong either. The galaxy is large enough for everyone, right?"" I nodded, trying to follow her logic. ""But in a galaxy as large as this, I believe that there is more to existence than meets the eye."" Her eyes twinkled as she spoke.

While we were speaking, another human walked by. Tall for them, with broad shoulders, and quite a lot of facial hair - beards was what they called them. His facial hair was neatly trimmed and oiled. As he walked by I could smell it, but I couldn't place the scent. Resinous, natural. It was pleasant.

As he walked by, he glanced down at the human I was speaking with, and saw her fingering her little charm - it was two straight pieces of metal crossed near the top, one smaller than the other - and smiled.

I looked up at him. We met eyes - my conversation partner didn't notice him - and he closed one eye quickly and then opened it again. I think it was called... a wink? It's one of those gestures humans do that's full of nuance. It's hard for most translators to understand it.

Just as quickly as it began, the interaction was over. He continued on with long purposeful strides towards the rear of the ship, towards Engineering.

Later that day, there was an announcement from the Captain that the drive was repaired and we could continue on to our destination. They would work hard to make up for lost time, but we would probably be a demi-cycle behind. Apologies were offered, discounts on future travel given out, but mostly everyone was happy we weren't stranded anymore.

A rumor started on the ship. While the engineers had the drive apart and were struggling to determine the failure, a *human* had walked into Engineering, looking around as if they belonged there, and approached the FlashWarp module, staring at it for a moment.

When confronted and asked what he was doing, he replied in perfect Maligran - the language of the engineers working that time - ""Have you checked the outer compensator? It looks cracked to me."" and then did that motion with one of his eyes - closing and opening the lid quickly - and left.

The engineers, with nothing else left to try checked the outer compensator. It was impossible to see with an unaided eye, but they scanned it and sure enough, it was cracked. Just enough to prevent the FlashWarp seed field from forming. They had a spare on hand, replaced it, and were up and running almost immediately.

The next morning, I sought out the human I had been speaking to yesterday at the morning meal. I asked her if she knew the human that had walked in, pointed out the error and left.

""What did he look like?""

I described him as best as I could, as well as the scent I noticed.

She nodded sagely. ""That sounded like Saint Eligius, patron saint of mechanical engineers.""

My fur puffed out involuntarily. ""A religious figure?""

She nodded and took a sip of coffee. ""A minor one, but one nonetheless.""

""And you're not surprised by this?""

""On the contrary, I'm pleased to hear that my prayers were answered.""

""You... prayed for him?""

""Not him specifically, but I did ask for help.""

I sat down at the table heavily. It seemed impossible that a human *saint* had walked by - had winked at me - and yet...

""Can you tell me more about your religion?""

Your relationship with technology might be more complicated than your last breakup. If you find yourself reaching for your phone before you're fully awake or feeling anxious when your battery dies, you're not alone in struggling with digital overload.

**This digital detox guide is for anyone who feels controlled by their devices** – whether you're a busy professional checking emails at midnight, a parent worried about your family's screen time, or someone who simply wants to reclaim their attention and peace of mind.

We'll walk through **how to spot the warning signs** of digital overwhelm that you might be missing, then help you **create a personalized digital detox plan** that actually works for your lifestyle. You'll also discover **practical ways to fill the void** left by reduced screen time with activities that genuinely satisfy you, plus **strategies to overcome common obstacles** like FOMO and withdrawal symptoms.

Most importantly, we'll show you **how to maintain digital wellness** long-term without completely giving up the technology that makes your life easier. This isn't about throwing your phone in a drawer forever – it's about creating a healthier, more intentional relationship with the digital world.

# Recognize Digital Overload Warning Signs

  


# Identify Physical Symptoms of Screen Fatigue

Your body has a way of telling you when digital overload is taking its toll. Eye strain stands as one of the most common warning signs, showing up as dry, irritated eyes that feel tired even after a full night's sleep. You might notice yourself blinking less frequently while staring at screens, which reduces the natural moisture your eyes need.

Headaches often accompany prolonged screen time, particularly tension headaches that start at the base of your skull and work their way forward. Poor posture from hunching over devices creates neck and shoulder pain that can persist throughout the day. Your sleep patterns may shift too - the blue light from screens disrupts melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep and stay asleep.

Physical restlessness becomes another red flag. You might feel fidgety when away from devices or experience phantom vibrations where you think your phone is buzzing when it isn't. Hand and wrist pain from repetitive motions like scrolling and typing can develop into more serious conditions if ignored.

# Spot Mental Health Red Flags from Excessive Usage

Digital overload creates distinct patterns in your mental state that deserve attention. Anxiety spikes when you can't check your phone or when battery levels drop low. This technology addiction often manifests as a constant need to stay connected, even during activities that should be relaxing.

Your attention span may feel fragmented, jumping from notification to notification without fully engaging with any single task. Concentration becomes difficult as your brain adapts to constant stimulation. Social media detox becomes necessary when online interactions start replacing face-to-face relationships or when you find yourself comparing your life to carefully curated online personas.

Mood swings tied to digital interactions signal another warning sign. Feeling irritable when interrupted during screen time or experiencing withdrawal-like symptoms when devices aren't available points to unhealthy dependency. Your self-worth might become tied to likes, comments, or online validation rather than real-world accomplishments.

Sleep quality deteriorates as your mind struggles to wind down from constant digital stimulation. Racing thoughts at bedtime often stem from information overload throughout the day.

# Assess Your Current Device Dependency Levels

Track your actual usage patterns to understand the scope of your digital habits. Most smartphones now include built-in screen time tracking tools that reveal surprising truths about your daily device interactions. Check how many times you pick up your phone each day - healthy usage typically stays under 50 pickups, while dependency often exceeds 100.

Calculate the hours spent on different apps and categories. Social media platforms, games, and entertainment apps can easily consume 3-4 hours daily without you realizing it. Compare weekday versus weekend usage to identify patterns.

Notice your emotional responses to being separated from devices. Healthy digital wellness means feeling comfortable leaving your phone in another room or turning it off for several hours. If separation causes immediate anxiety or panic, your dependency levels may need attention.

Evaluate how device usage affects your relationships and responsibilities. Missing sleep, skipping meals, or avoiding social situations to stay connected online indicates problematic usage patterns. Your digital balance strategies should address these areas where technology interferes with essential life functions.

Test yourself by implementing short screen time reduction periods. Start with one hour of device-free time and observe your comfort level. Difficulty lasting 30 minutes without checking devices suggests higher dependency levels that would benefit from a structured digital detox approach.

# Plan Your Personalized Digital Detox Strategy

  


# Set Realistic Technology Reduction Goals

Starting your digital detox journey requires honest assessment of your current screen time habits. Most smartphones now provide detailed usage statistics that reveal exactly how much time you spend on each app. Take note of these numbers for a full week to establish your baseline.

Once you understand your patterns, create specific, measurable goals rather than vague promises like ""use my phone less."" Examples include reducing social media scrolling by 30 minutes daily, checking email only three times per day, or limiting streaming services to one hour on weeknights.

The key to successful screen time reduction lies in gradual changes. If you currently spend four hours daily on your phone, don't aim to cut it to one hour immediately. Instead, reduce usage by 30-45 minutes each week until you reach your target. This approach prevents the overwhelming urge to abandon your digital wellness efforts entirely.

Track your progress using built-in screen time controls or third-party apps. Set daily limits for problematic applications and enable notifications when you approach these boundaries. Remember that setbacks are normal – focus on weekly averages rather than perfect daily performance.

# Choose the Right Detox Duration for Your Lifestyle

Digital detox duration depends entirely on your personal circumstances and goals. Beginners often benefit from micro-detoxes: one-hour periods without devices, phone-free meals, or technology-free mornings. These short breaks help you recognize how often you reflexively reach for your device.

Weekend digital cleanses offer a middle ground for those ready for longer commitments. Friday evening to Sunday morning provides enough time to experience genuine mental reset while remaining manageable for most lifestyles. This duration works particularly well for busy professionals who can't afford extended disconnection during weekdays.

For deeper digital minimalism practices, consider week-long detoxes during vacation periods. This timeframe allows your brain to fully adjust to reduced stimulation and helps break stubborn technology addiction patterns. Some people prefer monthly 24-hour detoxes, creating regular rhythm without major lifestyle disruption.

Your career and family responsibilities should guide your choice. Parents might opt for evening-only detoxes after children's bedtime, while freelancers could schedule longer breaks between projects. Start with shorter durations and gradually extend as your confidence grows.

# Create Device-Free Zones in Your Home

Establishing physical boundaries helps reinforce your digital balance strategies. The bedroom should be your first device-free zone since screens interfere with sleep quality and create unhealthy charging station habits. Invest in a traditional alarm clock and leave phones charging in another room overnight.

Transform your dining area into a connection zone where meals happen without digital distractions. Place a small basket near the entrance where family members deposit devices before eating. This simple change dramatically improves conversation quality and mindful eating practices.

Consider making your bathroom device-free to eliminate mindless scrolling during private moments. Many people don't realize how much unnecessary screen time accumulates in these brief intervals throughout the day.

Create a designated charging station in a common area like the kitchen or living room. This central location makes device access intentional rather than constant. Add attractive books, magazines, or puzzles nearby to provide alternative engagement options when you feel the urge to grab your phone.

# Schedule Regular Screen-Free Time Blocks

Successful digital wellness requires intentional scheduling just like any other important activity. Block specific hours in your calendar for device-free periods and treat these appointments as non-negotiable commitments to yourself.

Morning hours offer excellent opportunities for screen-free routines. The first 60-90 minutes after waking can be dedicated to meditation, exercise, journaling, or reading physical books. This practice sets a calm, intentional tone for your entire day and reduces phone addiction by establishing healthier morning habits.

Evening wind-down periods work equally well for digital detox practices. Create a one-hour buffer before bedtime where all screens power down. Use this time for relaxing activities like stretching, preparing for the next day, or having meaningful conversations with family members.

Consider implementing ""analog lunch breaks"" at work where you eat without checking emails, social media, or news websites. This mid-day reset improves afternoon focus and productivity while providing necessary mental rest from constant digital input.

Weekend screen-free blocks can extend longer – perhaps entire Saturday mornings dedicated to outdoor activities, household projects, or face-to-face social interactions. Start with 2-3 hour blocks and gradually extend duration as these practices become natural habits rather than forced restrictions.

# Replace Digital Habits with Fulfilling Activities

  


# Rediscover Offline Hobbies and Creative Pursuits

Breaking free from constant screen time opens doors to activities that genuinely nourish your mind and soul. Start by revisiting hobbies you once loved but abandoned in the digital rush. Whether it's painting, woodworking, cooking from scratch, or learning a musical instrument, these hands-on activities provide immediate satisfaction that scrolling through feeds simply can't match.

Creative pursuits offer unique benefits for your digital wellness journey. When you're focused on knitting a scarf or sketching in a journal, your brain enters a meditative state that naturally reduces stress and anxiety. Unlike the passive consumption of digital content, creating something with your hands engages multiple senses and builds genuine confidence.

Consider these fulfilling alternatives to screen time:

* **Artistic endeavors**: Drawing, painting, pottery, or photography with film cameras
* **Crafting projects**: Knitting, sewing, jewelry making, or home improvement tasks
* **Culinary adventures**: Baking bread, fermenting foods, or mastering new cuisines
* **Musical exploration**: Playing instruments, singing, or composing songs
* **Literary pursuits**: Reading physical books, writing poetry, or keeping a handwritten journal

The key is choosing activities that require full attention and create tangible results. This shift from consuming to creating helps rewire your brain's reward system, making digital minimalism feel less like deprivation and more like liberation.

# Strengthen Face-to-Face Relationships and Social Connections

Real human connection serves as one of the most powerful antidotes to technology addiction. When you prioritize in-person interactions over digital communication, you'll discover the irreplaceable richness of genuine social bonds. Start small by scheduling regular coffee dates, dinner parties, or game nights without phones present.

Face-to-face conversations activate mirror neurons and release oxytocin in ways that video calls and text messages simply cannot replicate. These biological responses create deeper emotional connections and improve your overall mental health. Many people report feeling more understood and less lonely after implementing screen time reduction strategies that prioritize real-world social interactions.

Here are practical ways to rebuild meaningful connections:

* **Regular meetups**: Host weekly dinners, book clubs, or hobby groups in your home
* **Active listening practice**: Put devices away during conversations and focus entirely on the other person
* **Community involvement**: Volunteer for local causes, join clubs, or attend neighborhood events
* **Family time**: Create device-free zones during meals and establish weekly family activities
* **Spontaneous visits**: Drop by friends' homes unannounced (with permission) instead of just texting

The beauty of strengthening offline relationships is that they provide natural accountability for your digital detox goals. Friends and family who support your journey toward digital balance become valuable allies in maintaining healthier tech habits long-term.

# Engage in Physical Exercise and Outdoor Activities

Physical movement serves as a natural reset button for minds overwhelmed by digital stimulation. When you replace sedentary scrolling with active pursuits, you'll experience immediate improvements in mood, energy, and sleep quality. The combination of fresh air, natural light, and physical exertion creates a powerful counterbalance to indoor screen time.

Outdoor activities offer particular benefits for digital wellness because nature inherently demands present-moment awareness. Whether you're hiking a trail, tending a garden, or playing sports, these activities require full engagement with your physical environment rather than virtual distractions.

Consider these movement-based alternatives to digital entertainment:

|**Activity Type**|**Examples**|**Digital Detox Benefits**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Cardiovascular**|Running, cycling, swimming, dancing|Releases endorphins, improves mood|
|**Strength Training**|Weightlifting, yoga, rock climbing|Builds confidence, requires focus|
|**Outdoor Adventures**|Hiking, camping, kayaking, gardening|Connects you with nature, reduces stress|
|**Team Sports**|Basketball, tennis, volleyball, soccer|Builds social connections, provides accountability|
|**Mindful Movement**|Walking meditation, tai chi, stretching|Calms anxiety, improves mindfulness|

Start with activities that genuinely interest you rather than forcing yourself into exercise routines you'll abandon. The goal isn't perfection but consistency in choosing physical engagement over digital consumption. Even a 20-minute walk around your neighborhood can significantly impact your mental clarity and reduce the urge to check your phone compulsively.

Regular physical activity also improves sleep quality, which naturally reduces late-night scrolling habits that often sabotage digital detox efforts. When your body is properly tired from real-world activities, you'll find it easier to put devices away and enjoy restorative sleep.

# Overcome Digital Detox Challenges Successfully

  


# Handle FOMO and Social Media Withdrawal

FOMO hits hard during your first digital detox attempt. Your brain keeps wondering what's happening on Instagram, whether someone tagged you in a post, or if you're missing out on important news. This anxiety is completely normal and actually signals that your digital wellness journey is working.

Start by acknowledging these feelings without judgment. Social media withdrawal creates real psychological discomfort because these platforms trigger dopamine releases similar to addictive substances. Your mind craves those constant notifications and instant gratification hits.

Combat FOMO by creating a ""highlight reel"" practice. Write down three meaningful things that happened in your real life each day. This shifts focus from others' curated online personas to your authentic experiences. Remember that social media shows edited versions of people's lives, not reality.

Set specific check-in times if complete social media detox feels overwhelming. Allow yourself 10 minutes twice daily to browse platforms mindfully, then log off immediately. Gradually reduce this time as your screen time reduction becomes more natural.

Replace scrolling habits with activities that provide genuine satisfaction. Call a friend instead of liking their post. Take a walk rather than watching travel videos. These real-world connections offer deeper fulfillment than digital interactions ever could.

# Manage Work-Related Technology Requirements

Balancing digital minimalism with professional responsibilities requires strategic planning. Most jobs demand constant connectivity, making complete technology addiction recovery challenging without smart boundaries.

Communicate your digital wellness goals with supervisors and colleagues. Explain that you're implementing focused work periods to boost productivity, not avoiding responsibilities. Many managers appreciate employees who proactively manage their attention and energy.

Create distinct work and personal technology zones. Use separate devices or accounts for professional tasks when possible. Set up automatic email responses explaining your response timeframes, helping manage expectations while protecting your digital balance strategies.

Batch similar tasks together to minimize constant device switching. Check emails at designated times rather than responding immediately to every notification. This approach actually improves work quality while supporting your digital cleanse benefits.

Consider requesting modifications like email-only communication instead of instant messaging apps, or scheduled phone meetings rather than constant availability. Most reasonable employers value productive, focused employees over those who are merely constantly connected.

# Deal with Family and Friend Resistance

Friends and family might react negatively to your digital detox journey, especially if they're used to constant contact through messaging apps and social media. This resistance often stems from their own relationship with technology rather than genuine concern about your choices.

Address concerns directly by explaining your motivations. Share specific benefits you've experienced, like better sleep or increased focus, rather than preaching about technology's dangers. People respond better to personal stories than lectures about screen time reduction.

Establish new communication rhythms with loved ones. Replace constant texting with weekly phone calls or face-to-face meetings. Many relationships actually deepen when you move beyond superficial digital interactions to meaningful conversations.

Set clear boundaries about your availability. Let close contacts know your preferred communication methods and response times. Some people might initially feel rejected, but consistent, kind explanations help them understand your commitment to digital wellness.

Suggest technology-free activities when spending time together. Propose hiking, cooking, board games, or other engaging experiences that don't revolve around screens. Often, others secretly appreciate these breaks from digital overwhelm but lack courage to suggest them first.

# Navigate Emergency Communication Needs

Safety concerns about reducing phone addiction often center around emergency situations. While valid, these fears shouldn't derail your digital detox progress. Smart planning addresses genuine safety needs without compromising your digital balance strategies.

Keep one primary communication method active at all times. This might be your phone's calling function while disabling social media and non-essential apps. Emergency contacts can still reach you without exposing you to digital distractions.

Inform trusted contacts about your digital detox schedule. Share alternative ways to reach you during deeper detox periods, such as landline numbers, work contacts, or specific family members who can relay urgent messages.

Consider investing in a basic phone for emergencies while keeping your smartphone stored away during intensive detox periods. These simple devices handle calls and texts without apps, notifications, or internet browsing temptations.

Create emergency protocols with household members or roommates. Designate specific people as primary contacts for different situations, reducing the need for constant personal device monitoring while ensuring someone can always coordinate emergency responses.

Plan ahead for situations requiring digital tools. Download offline maps before trips, write down important phone numbers, and carry physical backup information. Preparation eliminates many scenarios where you might break your digital detox commitment due to unexpected needs.

# Maintain Long-Term Digital Wellness Balance

  


# Establish Sustainable Technology Usage Boundaries

Creating lasting digital wellness means setting boundaries that actually stick. Start by defining specific time windows for different digital activities. For example, limit social media to 30 minutes during lunch breaks or designate 8-10 PM as your ""no-phone zone."" The key is making these boundaries realistic for your lifestyle rather than overly restrictive rules that you'll inevitably break.

Consider using app timers and built-in screen time controls as digital fences. Most smartphones now offer these features, allowing you to set daily limits for specific apps. When you hit your limit, the app becomes temporarily inaccessible. This creates a natural pause that helps break mindless scrolling habits.

Physical boundaries work wonders too. Keep your bedroom phone-free by investing in a traditional alarm clock. Designate certain areas of your home as tech-free zones, like the dining room or a cozy reading corner. These spaces become sanctuaries where real-world activities can flourish without digital distractions.

# Create Regular Mini-Detox Routines

Small, consistent breaks from technology often work better than dramatic digital cleanses. Weekly mini-detoxes help maintain your digital wellness without the shock of going completely offline. Try ""Silent Sundays"" where you keep your phone on airplane mode for a few hours, or implement ""No-Screen Mornings"" where you avoid all devices until after breakfast.

Daily micro-detoxes are equally powerful. Take a 20-minute walk without your phone, eat one meal without any screens, or spend the first hour after waking up device-free. These short breaks reset your relationship with technology and remind you that life exists beyond the screen.

Build seasonal digital detox routines that align with natural rhythms. During busy periods, even a 15-minute tech break can provide mental relief. The goal isn't perfection but consistency in creating regular spaces for digital rest.

# Monitor Your Progress and Adjust Habits

Tracking your digital wellness journey helps identify what's working and what needs tweaking. Use your phone's built-in screen time reports to spot patterns. Are you spending more time on social media during stressful weeks? Do certain apps consume more attention than others? This data becomes your roadmap for targeted improvements.

Create a simple weekly check-in with yourself. Ask: How did I feel about my technology use this week? What moments felt overwhelming? When did I feel most present and engaged? Write down these observations in a journal or notes app to track trends over time.

Don't be afraid to adjust your digital boundaries as life changes. A strategy that worked during summer might need modification when work gets busy or family situations shift. Regular monitoring allows you to adapt your approach rather than abandoning it entirely when circumstances change.

# Build Support Systems for Ongoing Success

Digital wellness works best when it's not a solo journey. Share your digital detox goals with friends and family members who can offer encouragement and accountability. Consider starting a group chat dedicated to sharing tech-free activities or weekly check-ins about screen time goals.

Find people who share similar digital minimalism values. Join local groups that focus on outdoor activities, book clubs, or hobby classes where phone use naturally decreases. These communities provide built-in support for maintaining reduced screen time while offering fulfilling alternatives to digital entertainment.

Create environmental support by involving your household in digital wellness practices. Establish family device-free meal times, organize regular outdoor activities, or designate specific hours as ""family connection time"" without screens. When everyone participates, maintaining digital balance becomes easier and more sustainable for everyone involved.

  


Breaking free from digital overload starts with honest self-reflection about your current habits and their impact on your well-being. Once you spot the warning signs and create a detox plan that works for your lifestyle, you're already halfway there. The real magic happens when you fill that extra time with activities that genuinely make you happy – whether that's reading, exercising, or simply having real conversations with people you care about.

The journey isn't always smooth, and you'll face moments when the pull of your devices feels overwhelming. That's completely normal. The key is building sustainable habits that don't make you feel deprived but instead help you find a healthy rhythm between your digital and offline life. Start small, be patient with yourself, and remember that even small steps toward digital wellness can make a huge difference in how you feel day to day.",1,1768310526.0,reverse_age_community,0,1.0,False

Back when I was a literature professor, if a student turned in a character sketch like that, they wouldn’t pass.

Why? Because it tells me what the person is on paper, but it says *nothing* about who they actually are.

In literature, we don’t care about demographics. We care about ""inner friction.""

Think about Raskolnikov or Anna Karenina. We don't remember them because of their age or their job titles. We remember them because of their contradictions and the messy things they’re actually worried about when the lights go out.

Marketing is no different. If you want to write copy that actually moves people, you have to stop chasing shortcuts and secret 'hacks' and just start looking at the human condition.

# How to write for humans (not data points)

* **Trade ""Interests"" for Fears**: People don’t buy a productivity tool because they have a passion for ""efficiency."" They buy it because they’re tired of feeling underwater, or because they’re scared of being the weakest link on the team. Ask what they’re running away from.
* **Find the Contradiction**: Someone might want to save money, but they also want to feel like they’ve ""made it."" That internal tug-of-war is where the best marketing is born.
* **The Power of the Specific Detail**: In a novel, you don’t just say a character is lonely; you describe them staring at a phone that won't ring. In marketing, don't just say your software is ""fast."" Describe the fact that they finally get to close their laptop while it’s still light outside.

I spent four years looking for marketing secrets in tools, LinkedIn posts, and spreadsheets, only to find them in the books I used to teach. It always comes back to the human condition.

Without hesitation, my best friend Anna tossed aside the ice pack and threw a deep V red dress at my face. ""Kim, either you cry to death now, or you put this on. Tonight, we’re going to the club and ruin him.""
In an attempt to escape the unbearable betrayal, I followed her advice, deciding to indulge for just one night with a nameless man, no strings attached. However, when the first light of dawn broke through, I was met with an even harsher reality than I could have imagined…😳🔥
Chapter 1
Kimberly

""Kimberly??"" Anna's voice got louder, laced with fear as she walked towards me.

With the way I was positioned; she probably thought I was dead.

“Oh my God, Kim!”

I remained on the floor with my legs pressed to my chest and my eyes staring blankly at the wall.

I just can't explain it... The physical squeeze my heart experiences every second I think back at what happened.

On the floor were the photographs. One, two and three.

The ones that made me contemplate taking my life. “Give me that,” Anna said sharply and took the photographs from me.

“Oh my.”

Her face said it all— the pictures are too intimate to not wonder.

How long has my boyfriend been sleeping with my step mother???

“This is unbelievable…” she swallowed hard, not taking her eyes off the photographs. “How did you get this?”

I sniffed and in that moment, she shoved the photographs away and turned to me. “I’m going to kill Ethan.”

If I wasn’t so concerned about my life and how to make my late dad proud, I’d have probably carried out the assasination myself.

“Okay, I need you to calm down okay? You’re going to stay here with me. I’ll be right here.”

She exhaled audibly like she was thinking of the best way to handle this.

Anna is three years older than I am, making her the big sister I never had. Actually, that makes her the only person who I can say genuinely loves me.

The reason I came here first from work is because I know I have a home here.

Not back to the woman who just laid with her step daughter's boyfriend, barely eight months after my father died.

And Ethan? How did I think so highly of him?

How stupid I was for seeing something that wasn't there.

For believing him when he said he loved me. For wanting to spend the rest of my life with him.

""Kim you can't keep doing this,"" Anna said, crouching just beside me. ""I admit that I never liked this guy... Something about him was just so off but look, I don't blame you.""

I sniffed.

""I don't blame you at all for falling in love with him but girl, I'm going to blame you if you keep sulking.""

“Can we get up from this hard floor now?” she groaned jokingly when my breaths turned back to normal. “Yeah,” I choked, my throat was on fire.

“Okay, you’re going to take a shower. I’ll get you a glass of lemonade,"" she added, lifting me up from the floor both literally and emotionally.

""No.""

She looked at me like I just dropped a bomb so I sniffed and then used my thumb to wipe my eyes. ""I need something stronger— vodka, whiskey... Definitely not lemonade.""

""Oh Jesus!"" she spat out, still looking at me with her brows arched. ""I got you.""

It usually takes an hour to get ready, but this time? It took two hours and forty-five minutes.

Anna wanted to make sure everything was perfect. From my lipstick to mascara and even my cleavage which she kept trying to scan.

""Perfect!"" She said with a wink. ""Now, you're going to get something strong and probably veined.”

I held her hand as we walked into the club. Blue and red strobe lights illuminated the room, making everyone appear more like a shadow.

This may not be what I need but fuck it, Ethan doesn’t deserve me.

The loud music had girls whining and everyone getting wild over a drink or something. I stood for a moment as Anna danced away only to return with drinks.

“Girl, loosen up and have so much fun. You need it, trust me. And here,” she added, stretching a glass of vodka to me. ""Think you need this?”

Without thinking twice, I took it and gulped the content.

I was taking the second glass when Anna pulled closer to me and whispered. “I see this guy I like over there. I’ll need to talk to him and see what I can get from him tonight.""

She chuckled and looked at me like a shepherd would look at his sheep. “Kim, I need you to think of what you wouldn’t do on a normal day and do it now. This is your time, you don’t want to look back at today and regret not taking action.”

She left after planting a soft kiss on my cheek and I just stood there.

Was I dumb to love Ethan the way I did?

Looking back at my purse, I took deep breaths to settle my feelings.

Just a few hours ago I was sure I was ready to get married at twenty-two.

I bought the fucking wedding gown when I should have just thrown the money into the ocean.

My insides turned to needles. Every breath hurting me. Was there something he saw wrong in me?

I thought he was everything I needed; Slim, tall, and kind. So wasn’t I everything he needed too?

“You need something, ma’am?”

The clear stern voice of the bartender reminded me I was not on my bed but in a fucking club with loud music.

I nodded immediately and swallowed hard. “Distilled whiskey, please.”

“Sure.”

He did his thing and returned to me with a flute of whiskey. I took it with a nod of thanks and gulped it.

I exhaled while letting the last droplet of whiskey sit on my tongue.

What wouldn’t I do on a normal day?

I turned my head and my eyes fell on a broad-chested man, smiling as he whispered some words to his phone.

I turned back to the bartender. ""Another glass, please. I'll uh— I'll appreciate something stronger.""

Something in me switched, urging me to look at my side again. I obliged, only to find dark gray eyes staring my way.

His eyes connected with mine for a few seconds before I blinked away.

I’m not sure who cared to listen but at that point, I knew what I wouldn’t do on a regular day is to fuck an older man who may be married with kids.

I took a deep drink from what was left in my glass and closed my eyes, willing myself to be calm.

I dropped the glass and swallowed hard. My hand moved to the neckline of my plum colored wrap dress. It isn’t that revealing, but I feel exposed before his knowing gaze.

Clearing my throat, I tried to act oblivious of his stare but it was so difficult to ignore.

You don't see men who dress to fit in at this upscale place all the time. Charcoal gray slacks cut perfectly to accentuate the taper of his waist, and a black linen shirt that draped across his powerful body.

You know what? I'm just going to go straight to him, and then I'm going to tell him to take me home.

Simple, right?

I was just about to order an extra glass for some confidence boost but I stopped myself.

If I drink a little more every time I feel on edge tonight, I’ll get plastered.

Footsteps on the vinyl flooring behind me made my stomach twist.

""Sure you're okay?"" He asked with a concerned smile. ""You've been staring really hard.""

""At you?""

He held up his hands as a gesture of surrender.

""My eyes just happened to land on you,"" I claimed. ""Nothing special.""

He took a sip from his wineglass, utterly unhurried, completely and maddeningly calm.

“If it was nothing special, I wouldn’t be standing out here now,” he said softly. ""I saw it on your face the moment I looked at you.""

I shook my head.

""I'm sorry about what your ex did to you.""

I choked. ""What? How... How did you know that?""

""Did I know that? No. Did you just confirm it? Yes.""

Holy fuck, who is this man?

I feel naked in front of him. Exposed, and vulnerable.

I can’t think straight, thanks to the alcohol but all I want is to get away.

To get away from here, and maybe to get away with him.

""I'm not enjoying this.""

“I think you are.”

The presumption of this man. “Excuse me?”

""Scrap that, I am actually a boring man."" His tone remained diffident, but his eyes were another story. ""But I think you already know that. Just the way I know what you really want.""

My eyes arched, just so I could look at him properly.

“On your terms, and within your limits,"" he added.

""I uh..."" Oh shit, am I tongue tied? ""I don’t understand what you’re talking about..""

""You want this, don't you?” It was the bulge in his pants.

“I want to fuck you.”

When a stranger you barely met says he wants to fuck you to your face, normal people are supposed to run, right?

Apparently, l'm not normal.

I'm frozen in place. Not because it’s absolutely absurd but because a part of me is actually considering it…

Chapter 2
Kimberly

“Let’s get out of here,” he growled, moving his right hand down to grab my waist.

My body reacted immediately to the soft touch. It wasn't even anything sexual but my body knew what was coming and hell, it couldn't wait.

“Why?” I asked, tilting my head a little. “Why do you think I’ll go with you?”

I mean, I only got here like a couple of minutes ago and uh— scrap that, I just do not want to appear like a cheap girl.. if that makes any sense.

His eyes told me he knew I was just trying to play hard to get. He pulled me closer, his lips grazing my ear as he whispered, “I want to fuck you and you want to be fucked. Do we need any more reason?”

That was it— the older man sauce. The hardcore transparency.

A smirk formed right on my lips and just as I bit my lower lip, he dove right in and kissed me.

His tongue was fucking my mouth with dominant strokes, making my knees weak. With one hand on my ass and the other on the back of my neck, he imprisoned me to his delicious assault.

He slid a warm hand round the nape of my neck as his other hand pulled me against his stunningly hard body, teasing me. He tilted my head to expose my neck. Slowly, his lips press against my sensitive skin.

This is already more intimate than anything that has ever happened to me and I can't even deny it.

He's probably this free because it's a private club but what if... What if he's married?

Not wanting to ruin my night with that big question, I let him kiss me.

This stranger consumed me with only a kiss and I could feel my heart leap in fear. I was scared of this intensity, this lust, this irresistible need for him… I pushed him back a little to catch my breath.

""Let's get out of here."" This time, it wasn't a question... It was an order.

I wasn't sure how but we kissed right until we got into the car. There was uh— there was a driver and so it was just the both of us.

He gave me a lopsided grin before licking his bottom lip in a hypnotizing way. ""I like me an insatiable girl.""

Uh... What is that supposed to mean? I'm kidding, I know what it means.

I've just uh— I've just not heard someone say they like it. Ethan used to complain all the time of how high my libido is and how I really should take a chill pill but guess who couldn't control himself and laid with someone else?

Him.

Him, not me.

Letting an anticipatory grin on my face, I took out my phone to message Anna.

ME: I think I found the one thing I wouldn't do on a regular day. Wish me luck.

We stopped in front of a mansion and my jaw dropped when he got the door for me.

""I need you to loosen up and just enjoy the rest of the night. Can you do that for me?""

Oh my God. I nodded.

""So now, fuck whatever it is your ex did to you.""

""I should never have admitted it,"" I laughed, not exactly feeling judged. “What do you do for a living?” I found myself asking. I couldn’t take my eyes away from the sight enough to look at his face, but I heard his chuckle.

“I have money if that’s what you’re asking. A lot of it.”

I knew that. From the moment he stepped closer to me, his cologne gave him away.

His eyes gave me shivers… the best kind. I felt the throbbing need between my legs with just one look from him. I stopped breathing, waiting for what was coming next.

He stretched his hands, giving me a platter to place mine.

I did, following him. I was a little tipsy but I knew exactly what I wanted and how I wanted it.

As soon as we stepped inside, my back found the wall with his lips on mine. His hands roamed over my body hungrily as he lifted me off the floor.

I expected him to ask if I wanted a drink... or food or maybe just have a make small-talk for a while but that wasn't on his list, I guess.

I moaned into his mouth, wrapping my legs around him.

I couldn’t help but moan when I felt his cock line with my pussy. Even with clothes on, his hardness caused delicious friction on my body.

Shit. This was so intense, I felt ready to explode. He held me right in place like I was made to be in his arms. His mouth lowered to the curve of my neck, where his lips grazed my skin. I leaned into him, arching against him reflexively.

The kiss deepened until it was clear that I was going to explode. He dropped me gently and moved his fingers leisurely down the length of my legs.

I arched my back with a loud moan at the first contact of his fingers to my wet panties.

""Don't you like that, Kim?""

I moaned, wondering when my name slipped off my mouth but with his fingers just in the right place, I moaned again... This time spreading my legs.

I groaned with the sensation of his mouth on me, feeling drunk as he sucked my folds into his mouth before he lifted his head, ""Did he ever eat you out this good?""

His fingers were teasing my opening as his tongue did the same to my clit. I dove my fingers into his hair, arching my back to the sensation and cried out my orgasm the moment he thrust two fingers inside me. ""You need a better memory of being fucked, kindly.""

Spreading my legs further apart. His tongue turned me frantic. “Oh… fuck! Oh my God! Fuck…” I moaned, rubbing my pussy on his face as I rode his fingers, urging him to go harder, faster. He pushed another finger inside me, stretching me as he kept up the steady assault on my clit.

“You’re so wet, Princess.”

The thought of him on his knees in front of me coupled with the sounds of him enjoying the act of pleasing me is too much for me to bear.

I barely has time to catch my breath as my legs trembled uncontrollably and my stomach tied itself into euphoric knots.

There it was— a tremor was hitting me bad.The more my legs shake, the faster he licks me...building a pile of pleasure in my stomach.

God, I’m so close…

Before I could return to my senses, I felt another orgasm building up deep inside me from his relentless tongue and insistent fingers on my g-spot. “Oh… shit... Yes! Argh, fuck yes.""

""I'm going to show you something you'll like.""

My mouth was still parted as he grabbed a condom from the night stand.

“Go on your fours.” I did as I was told, waiting in anticipation for the moment I would feel him.

I turned, waiting on my fours for the promise of something I'd like.

He fisted my hair just in that moment and jerked me back to his chest, a loud groan got free from my throat.

The chaos he’s created in the pit of my tummy fuses together and I arched my back, waiting to feel him from behind.

""You're going to cum for me,"" he continued. The domination, the sudden roughness in his moves after being gentle put my senses on alert.

He hit the right spot inside me with one rough stroke and that made my mouth drop.

Then it hit me, like an unexpected crack of thunder before the rain.

“Arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,” I cried out, my toes curling and my legs falling to the bed. There’s no way I can contain all that pleasure.

I have never felt this way in my twenty-two years of living.

Turning me back, he slapped my folds as a way of awakening more pleasure.

He licks my folds, drawing out the proof of pleasure until they’re red, swollen, and throbbing mercilessly.

""You deserve this,"" he told me through gritted teeth, thrusting his hips into me harder. ""But you deserve something else.""

I was still panting hard, unsure of what could be better than this. “What?” I panted.

Chapter 3
Kimberly

My eyes blinked open. Soft, golden early morning sunlight filling the room.

Gauzy curtains waved gently in the breeze and right at that moment, it came flooding back. Nothing prepared me for this… the soreness that came with a pleasurable night.

Holy shit.

""What time is it?"" I asked no one in particular.

I glanced over at him, still sleeping next to me, his burly arm looped around my waist.

I could appreciate the deliciously sexy naked man lying before me, but I need to get out of here before he wakes up.

This man is the sexiest man I've ever seen. He should be a little into his forties but that's not even the best part. I lost count of how many orgasms he gave me.

Silently, I climbed out of bed, trying to find my dress shoes and purse—everything I'd worn last night, my panties not excluded.

I glanced at the clock on the nightstand and quickly tied my dress, putting on my shoes.

I rubbed my eyes, letting go of every dizziness. As much as my thighs hurt. I’d be doomed to remain here.

I felt a strong urge, a temptation to run my fingers through his thick, disheveled hair and kiss his perfect mouth. But I can't.

My God.

This man is all muscle and masculinity and sex.

I let him tongue-fuck me in his penthouse several times over as I moaned loudly. Basically within one hour of meeting him.

Aside from the fact that I cannot return home, I also have no means of going to Anna's place.

Glancing again at his big body, those broad, tanned shoulders, the sheet low over his perfect washboard abs, I shook off the thoughts in my head.

I can't ask for his help.

He's not supposed to see me again and well, I'm just glad I didn't give him any information about…I stopped in my tracks when my phone buzzed on the table.

I checked and it was Anna. Shit, I need to call her.

Unable to resist the urge, I reached for the paper on the table to scribble a thank-you at least when my eyes found something shocking.

""What the fuck???"" I mumbled out, immediately freezing.

I didn't realize I was holding my breath until he appeared behind me. My gasp must have woken him up and now—

""What the fuck??"" I let out in disbelief turning to face him. ""You? You're Ethan's father..""

The words felt even heavier as they left my mouth.

He stood there, bare-chested. ""I can explain, Kimberly.""

""And you fucking know my name!!"" I yelled. Wait a minute... Did I just fuck my boyfriend's— scrap that, my ex-boyfriend's father?

""Kimberly, I can explain.""

""Oh my goodness,"" I muttered, raising my hands to hold my chest. ""You... Oh my..""

""Yes. I found out who you were yesterday, but I couldn't say it. You wanted to get rid of whatever was going on in your head and I just wanted you to have that.""

I shook my head. ""What are you even doing here? Ethan doesn't know you're here. Does he?""

He shook his head.

Of course! He's Ethan's estranged father... Elias Grey walked out of his life when he was only five.

I turned back to the portrait of a happy Ethan with his father. This is probably the last time he ever saw him, at his fifth birthday party.

""Kimberly, you cannot judge me, okay? I was looking out for you.""

A tear threatened to drop from my eyes. ""Did you know?""

""Know what?""

""Know that Ethan... Ethan has been sleeping with my stepmom?""

He shook his head as if disgusted with that revelation. ""I'm sorry, Kim.""

""No, you're not. You just... You just made me do the same thing.""

""Did I?"" He asked. ""Cause if I were you, I wouldn't refer to him as my boyfriend.""

My stomach dropped as whatever grip I'd managed to keep on my anxiety was lost.

""What do you want from me?"" I asked him. ""You miraculously show up and the first thing you do is fuck your son's girlfriend?""

""Ex-girlfriend,"" he corrected.

My throat closed at his apathetic tone. ""You're unbelievable.""

After a moment of silence passed, I found myself still confused and in need of something tangible.

""So what do you want to do? You know... This isn't the best way to show you're a great father after so many years. You can't fix things like this.""

""I'm not here to fix things.""

My eyes shot up. ""What?""

A low chortle escaped my mouth and then I looked at him one last time. ""What are you here for, then?""

""To get a wife, and I've found her. Marry me, Kimberly.""

""What the actual fuck!?""

""You wanted to get married at 22, it's been your dream for so long and you obviously wanted to end up with a man who knows you, who sees you, and who worships your body. Hasn't this proven that I know your body more than any man would?""

The pure authority in his tone, coupled with the way he kept looking me straight in the eyes made my knees weak.

""I... I need to get out of here.""

I grabbed my purse and turned to leave, but he held my arms just in time and turned me to face him.

Without warning, he leaned in and kissed me. There was no urgency, but there was a raw need.

It was full of lust, and passion, but this time there was also familiarity in his lips.

Moaning into the kiss, I wanted more… and this was dangerous, this was where I needed to make it stop. ""Elias..."" I moaned, but his lips didn’t leave me.

""Tell me you want this too, Kim.. you're hurt and you want revenge. I see it in your eyes, Kim. I can give that to you.""

“I can’t… uh… I uh...” I moaned but continued before he could have a chance, ""I can't do this... This makes no sense at all.""

He nodded.

""Then I hope I've at least raised the standard for how a man should make you feel. Both in bed, and outside.""

I turned my back and walked away without looking back because I knew if I stopped for a second I would go back and jump on him.

I can't let that happen, right?

Chapter 4
Elias

""Damn it!!”

How on earth could I be so careless? I shouldn't have let her find out this way...

No, don't get me wrong. I was going to tell her... I was definitely going to say something but not this way.

Now, everything is messed up even before it begins.

Closing my eyes and balling my fist, I could feel her skin on my fingertips, remembering the way her body curved so deliciously.

You know what Elias? She's too young for you.

I'm forty-two and my son is a little over twenty. I had Ethan when I was really young and now I'm going for a girl a little over eighteen?

I get it, she's twenty-two but that's not even it. She's struggling with things I'm not supposed to get involved in.

Ethan doesn't know I'm back in New York. Nobody does, because I've kept a low profile for the past six months trying to get things done my way.

I wasn't even supposed to approach her in the club but when I saw her? I knew there wasn't going to be any peace until I was sure she was safe.

I saw the pain in her eyes… I’ve been there and so I could feel the emotions coursing through her. She needed an escape and I wasn’t about to let her slip into the wrong man’s arms.

How did she even put up with him? He's my son, yes but I didn't raise him that way.

I barely even raised him and that too, is not my fault. His mother did everything she could to keep me away and filled his head with too many stories of me that I could depict from the way Kim reacted to me.

My attention suddenly got diverted to Manio who has been my eyes outside. He goes out to wherever the hell I want him to, gets the information, and returns back to me.

My glance remained on him running his hand through his long hair as he smoked a cigarette.

""Smoking isn't the best for your health. You know that?""

""I also know you're not my father,"" he responded rather arrogantly and then swallowed hard. ""I don't mean no disrespect, sir.""

""Hell, you do and I'll tell you, if you ever speak to me that way... You're not going to make it past an hour in pain.""

Getting the message clearly, he nodded. “Understood, sir.""

It's been two days since Kimberly left and there's been no word from her. Not like I had expected her to call me, or text but shit— I didn't expect her to go all silent on the man who gave her the best orgasm of her life.

She probably needs some time but I also need some information and that is why I sent Manio to the exact place I figured she'd be.

I’m not a fucking stalker, but when you’re as addicted to perfection in human form as I am, you have to take certain measures.

I don't like to assume things nor do I presume. I like to operate with factual information because, in my dictionary, information is deadlier than any gun.

It’s a weapon of mass destruction, and if there’s anything I learned from my psycho mother, it's that you need information.

That’s why I should be focused on getting information. My main mission with Kimberly isn't just to get information. There's so much more with that young woman.

Everything I ever thought about blurred somewhere between her erotic moans and the way she looked at me while she came apart around my fingers.

I know she was scared. Who wouldn't be? But I meant it when I said I found the woman I wanted to marry.

I've never been married before. In fact, I never thought about it until a few months ago when all of these started.

She might not have a single clue about what is happening, but her life and mine are intertwined closer than she’ll ever know.

Having Ethan at nineteen and losing him at barely twenty-four shaped me in such a way that I never saw coming.

I thought I knew it all, that I had it all but shit got out of hand.

""You're okay?"" Manio asked from where he was sitting.

""Yes, why?""

""Because we're home, Boss.""

Usually, Anton is around to join me inside. He’s the only one who I have trusted enough to let inside my abode but he’s away— to see his wife and daughter.

He’s in no way like me and I understand that. I do not envy him anyway.

“Do you need help?” Mario asked but I said nothing.

The silence already gave him the response he needed. Help with what? My dick?

The automatic light went off in the entrance as soon as I was inside.

The penthouse spans the entire top floor, glass-walled and steel-edged.

My abode… the kind of space you feel before you even step into it.

Everything in here was built to specification. You walk in, and you understand. This place does not accommodate chaos, it commands it.

I took off my jacket and fell to the couch, letting out a small sigh. I wasn't sure how I managed to sleep off, but I did. Half-asleep on the couch with my shirt unbuttoned, tilting my neck.

I’ve had too much to handle in just a few days and I needed rest. Not sex, rest.

My body had given in before my mind. I wasn't deep in sleep, I was just... disconnected, enjoying the warmth of the empty house until the beep sounds of the security alarm pulsed.

My eyes flew open and I stood up immediately, sensing that something was wrong.

Adrenaline flooded my system and I moved. From the concealed drawer beneath the bookshelf, my hand gripped the cool metal.

Who the hell would bypass my security?

I took one step forward and my jaw dropped. Impossibly long legs covered in tight-fitting light-blue jeans were barely three inches past the door.

And just like that, the world narrowed to Kimberly.

Heat surged me as my eyes raked over her. She was wrapped in a black top that looked like it had been tailored onto her body.

She straightened, her dark curls falling down her back, and the scoop-neck blacktop exposed a good amount of cleavage.

""Kimberly?""

""I'm here to talk.""

I should have demanded to know how she got past security but all I said was, ""You came back.""

I needed to know why she was here but I didn't want to hear it yet. All I needed was an answer, a response, a deal.

Without waiting a second more, I looked at her.

 ""Do you want my help?”

Chapter 5
Kimberly

I swallowed hard, looking at the way his brows reached. He’s been waiting for this. Waiting for me. Waiting for my response but do I even have a damn response to give this man?

“…Kim?”

“No,” I blurted. “No. Okay? No.”

“Hmmm. What is no?”

“I don’t need your help,” I added, just in case he didn’t get the previous lines. “I’m only here to get my EarPods.”

“Your EarPods.” He repeated softly. “Is that correct?”

“Yes. I don’t want to leave anything of mine with you.”

“But you already left something,” he countered, leaning on the counter. “Why didn’t you tell me?”

My confusion knew no bounds at first. My brows shot up, my nose scrunched up and my eyes pooling together. “What are you talking about?”

“You bled on my bed, Princess. You were a virgin and you gave that out willingly… without looking back.”

Damn it.

“So you’ve never been with a man.” This was more of a statement and less of a question,

“Do you have any idea how sexy that is?” he said. I gritted my teeth and looked away but that didn’t make him stop. “How sexy it is to know that my touch is the only one you know.”

I scoffed. “I touch myself.”

“I know that,” he said sternly. “I can see it in your eyes that you touched your little tight pussy before coming here. Is that wrong, Princess?”

Droplets of sweat ran down the well of my breasts and gathered in my belly button. It agitated me, this feeling of sticky sweat all over.

I hate how he’s right. I haven’t been myself since we slept together. It’s like I unlocked something and I’ve been trying to get there, myself. My fingers and even the vibrators I got don’t seem to be helping much.

My hair clung to my face, back and sides. Elias knows his effect on me and he’s trying to de it to his advantage.

The way he says the word unapologetically always gets to me but I can’t show him that. I’m not some whore he can just fuck simply because I’m hurt.

“Like I said, I want my—”

“EarPods,” he finished. “Or is it an orgasm you really want? You came here for my cock, Kim and you know it.”

“I am not sleeping with you!” I hollered. “I… I..”

“You what?”

I was going to say I regret it but the words wouldn’t even come out of my mouth. I know I don't regret it… who ever regrets a moment like that?”

“Never mind.”

“Kimberly,” he continued. His right hand lifted toward my face. It was pure instinct that bade me to close my eyes when his fingers caressed first my brow, then my cheekbone, the curve of my jaw, and finally, his thumb across the bow of my lip. “You are so damn innocent and I want to get you dirty, seeing my cum on your face while you beg me… I want to bend you over and have you cuss out on that naughty little boy who chose your step mother over you.”

I swallowed hard, my blood boiling.

I know what he’s trying to do and I shouldn’t let him rile me up for nothing.

“I know your body and how it wants to feel my touch.”

I pulled my face from under his seductive grip and pushed it away, “You don't know me! You don't know my body. You don't know a single thing about me. You're just some sick pervert who would say any shit to get anyone to lay with him.”

Suddenly, he burst into a fit of laughter so loud and forceful.

“I don’t want any other woman,” he continued.

“I don’t believe you.”

To my surprise, he grabbed my face in his hands and kissed me on the mouth so intensely it made my lips hurt a little.

His face lingered close to mine, his breath warm on my mouth. “Do you believe it now?”

“No.”

Again, he kissed me, holding my face like he was trying to remind me who’s in charge.

When his tongue moves across the seam of my lips I feel things between my legs I have never felt before from just a kiss.

I hate it… how my body language has become so receptive that my facial expression no longer matters.

There’s sort of an aching in my chest. I can feel my heart beating not only in my chest, but within those secret folds.

“I’m sure we can work something out.”

“Fuck you,” I said and looked at him with disgust. I wiped my mouth, and took one step back. “We’re not working shit and I’m not letting you touch me.”

“Well, Princess,” he called calmly. “That was really fun… your performance but I’m afraid I have some business to attend to; so that means you’ll have to return home to touch yourself.”

A cold chill ran up my spine and I swallowed a little too hard.

He reached into his pocket and took out the EarPods. “You intentionally left it here so you could come back. Here, take it.”

I took the EarPod, feeling naked that he could tell. What part of dropping it on the counter did he get caught on camera? Because there’s no damn way he just guessed what really happened.

“Sir, you’re-”

“Sir?” He laughed. “Call me Elias. That’s the name I want you moaning when I’m inside you.”

“Alright, Mr. Elias, tell you what. I’ll take you at your word and I’ll leave. Don’t come for me; I have nothing you need.”

“You have everything I need and everything you need to feel better. You’re torturing yourself when you’re not the one who should feel this way. You’re not the one who cheated.”

I gasped.

“I want you to go through that door knowing that I gave you an offer. A chance to make them suffer for what they’ve done to you while making you fucking rich.”

Chapter 6
Kimberly

I can’t tell anyone any of the things going on in my head and it’s the reason why I keep zoning out while working out.

“Hey!” Anna called as she walked over to me, wiping her forehead with a towel. “You sure you really want to work on those legs today?”

“Yeah,” I answered without looking her way.

“Girl, you’re acting like you’ve got two weeks to build a summer body.”

I straightened, catching my breath. “I probably don’t have up to that. Moreover, it’s leg day,” I said, wiping sweat from my forehead. “I’m trying to make the pain in my thighs louder than the one in my chest.”

She snorted, still taking deep breaths. “That’s one way to do therapy.”

“And I’m happy it’s working. For now.”

“What do you mean for now?” She asked, folding her hands. “It’s been a week and trust me, you’re doing well.”

It sounded like a compliment or something to be proud of but I just shrugged.

Anna grabbed her towel and checked her phone. “I’d stay and kill my thighs with you, but I’ve got to get to work. You know how it gets.”

“I do,” I answered and watched her gather her things. Anna doesn’t have my type of job. What she has requires her to be at work every damn day of the week.

I smiled faintly. “At least there’s something to keep your mind busy.”

“Don’t start,” she whined. “One phone call is what it’s going to take. Remember I’m always going to answer my phone once it’s you.”

“Coming from you? I’m honored.”

Anna is that friend who always has her phone on Do Not Disturb. I don’t know how she does it but her avoidant ass never picks up the phone at first ring.

She slung her bag over her shoulder. “One more thing,” she added. “Just remember—no man is worth skipping leg day for.”

I laughed as she walked off, but when the sound of her footsteps faded, the weight of the silence hit me harder than the dumbbells ever could.

Suddenly, I was back to working out alone and hearing his voice.

This is insane.

I stayed for a few minutes after she left but I just couldn’t do more. Walking straight to the cafe shop in front of the gym, I looked around.

I have no idea who the owner of this cafe is but they have certainly made so much money for themselves.

The smell of coffee filled the air and it’s the world’s greatest smell.

I’m only here for the coffee even though I'm already having a row of sleepless nights and it’s all thanks to the mess I’m in.

I pushed open the opaque door and strode inside. These people sure know how to make pastries, and they make them fresh every morning. The aroma always permeates the air and leaves you wondering if you’ve got enough bucks to spare.

I walked straight to the front of the display and looked around, my eyes locked on the chocolate-drizzled croissant that looks way too perfect to be real

I stepped forward in line, and after a few seconds, I figured there were only two people in front of me.

“Great,” I muttered to myself cause I really need to get back home to wash off the sweat and his damn scent from my body.

I wasn’t exactly interested in doing anything to whirl away time so I stood still until the woman in front of me grabbed her coffee and stepped away.

I stepped forward and smiled at the young man in front of me. He’s not the person who I usually meet here but I don’t really care.

All I wasn’t is my—

“Morning!” He said cheerfully. “

He was a burly guy with smooth, dark skin and a shaved, nicely shaped head. A neatly lined beard framed his jaw and on second glance, I could spot the tattoos on his forearms and the edge of his collar.

“Hey,” I answered.

He didn’t say anything else, just arched his brow like he was waiting for what I was going to say next.

“Latte.”

“Right. You don’t seem like the type who likes anything other than the usual.”

“Hmmm.” I waited a little for him to get it ready and the moment he did, I smiled at and grabbed it.

“Don’t mention,” he said before I even had the chance to say thank you.

I walked straight to where I parked my Hyundai car and slipped in.

I honestly would have just sat somewhere and watched a movie while sipping my coffee but I don’t feel like it.

I slammed the car door shut and sank into the seat with a hiss. “Damn it,” I muttered, pressing my palms against my thighs.

They ache like hell, every muscle screaming from that stupid workout I swore would “fix everything.”

Yeah, sure. Now I can’t even move without feeling like I got hit by a truck.

I twisted the key in the ignition, and of course, the engine coughed instead of starting. “Come on, don’t do this to me,” I groaned, giving the steering wheel a weak slap.

My phone started buzzing in the cup holder but I didn’t pay any attention at first. I continued trying to start the car and when my efforts seemed futile, I glanced down.

The moment I see his name flashing across the screen, my chest tightens. For a second, I think about telling him to come get me cause I can already tell I’ll be frustrated here.

“Hey?” My voice came out sharper than I planned.

“Hey, Kim… I just wanted to check in,” he said, sounding all careful and soft, like I might break.

I snorted. “Check in,” I repeated. “Yeah, you want to check in.” I leaned back, the seat creaking under me. “I just got into my car, and my day’s already trash. What do you want to say?”

“That’s crazy,” he said. “Anyway, I’m driving to your place now… I wanted to know if you’re home.”

“Well, I just said I’m not home. I’m having car issues at…”

“I’ll just head home and leave the gifts with Gina. Thought to let you know. See you soon hunny!”

I swallowed hard as the call beeped in my ear. Did Ethan just end the call on me?

Right.

And what did he say again? He’s going home to meet my stepmom. “Wow. Just wow.”",3,1768309631.0,novelsfree,4,1.0,False

1qbqstu,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliancerepair/comments/1qbqstu/creatista_uno_steam_wand_not_working/,Creatista Uno Steam Wand not working,"The milk steaming cycle starts normally and produces strong steam for a few seconds. At \~10–15 seconds/4 pumps of steam it stops abruptly (cuts out) and the clean steam wand warning light begins to flash and it does not do the normal end-of-cycle auto purge. The behaviour is intermittent over long timeframes: after months of not using steaming, it has sometimes worked for several cycles, then reverted to failing again.

What I’ve already tried:

\- Descaled the machine and thoroughly cleaned the steam wand tip holes with the pin tool.

\- Removed the steam tip/nozzle entirely and repeated tests (still cuts out in the same way).

\- Ran the steaming cycle with water only (no milk). Same problem occurs.

\- Confirmed coffee/water delivery is normal: I ran 3 lungo cycles and flow was strong and consistent each time.

\- Confirmed the steam circuit can pass water:

\-Manual purge has never had an issue and reliably pushes water through the steam wand.

\-In descaling mode I can run water through the steam wand as well.

\- The spring-loaded silver temperature sensor contact in the drip tray has a discoloured/matte patch, but pressing down on the jug during steaming makes no difference.

\- Jug placement/contact doesn’t change the behaviour.

\- After leaving the machine powered off for \~60 minutes, the problem still occurs.

\- The steam tip seals have a couple of tiny slices in them (I’m not sure if they’re significant; the issue still occurs even with the tip removed).

Based on this, what is the most likely failing component (e.g., steam heater/thermoblock assembly, thermoblock NTC/temp sensor/wiring, steam solenoid valve, drip tray/jug heat sensor, etc.)?

1qbqsf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/gomining/comments/1qbqsf4/just_join_this_awesome_community/,Just join this awesome community!,"Been quietly building in the GoMining ecosystem for the past 3-4 months, and honestly, it's opened up a whole new side of crypto for me that I never really touched before.
I started super small last fall – just a couple of basic digital miners with like 5-10 TH total, mostly out of curiosity. No real plan, just wanted to see if this NFT-hasrate thing actually paid out real BTC without me having to deal with noisy rigs or sky-high Danish electricity bills. Fast forward to now: I'm sitting at 68 TH, and the daily rewards are landing around ~3,000 sats (give or take, depending on the day’s network difficulty and BTC price around $92k). It's not massive, but it's steady, and after maintenance fees (with the discounts I've unlocked), I net a nice chunk that I can withdraw anytime to my personal wallet – no lockups, no BS.
The journey from those first few TH to 68 has been addictive in a good way. I upgraded power and especially efficiency bit by bit (aiming for better W/TH ratios), reinvested most of the BTC earnings back in, and hit that daily service button religiously (set a reminder because missing it once drops your efficiency quick). It's like compounding interest but with mining power – small steps add up fast. The ecosystem makes it easy: buy/upgrade miners on the marketplace, boost them, and watch the hashrate grow while real facilities in the US do the heavy lifting.
One thing that's surprised me is how the weekly rewards (from staking veGOMINING, clan stuff in Miner Wars, or just holding) help cover those pesky maintenance fees. I pay most of my fees in GOMINING tokens now for the 15-20% discount (VIP level perks kick in nicely at my size), so instead of BTC getting eaten up automatically, I keep more of my daily mining output pure. The weekly token rewards I get from staking/participating often refill my virtual wallet enough to cover a big portion of the next week's fees – sometimes even more on good weeks. It creates this nice loop: earn BTC daily → use some for upgrades → stake GOMINING for discounts and extra rewards → fees get cheaper → more net BTC. Feels sustainable, not just hype.
The GOMINING token itself ties everything together – utility for fees, burns from maintenance keeping supply in check, staking for governance and boosts.
Biggest unexpected bonus? This whole thing pushed me into Reddit and X properly for the first time. I was never really active – lurked maybe – but now I'm in communities, following updates, chatting with people about efficiency tips, clan strats, or just sharing screenshots of payouts. It's given real advantages: spotted better upgrade deals, learned optimization tricks from others at similar hashrate levels, even got bonuses rolling in. Turned a solo experiment into something social and way more rewarding.
Overall, the GoMining ecosystem feels like a solid way into BTC mining without the headaches – accessible, gamified just enough to stay engaged, and growing (launchpad, more features, etc.). Not financial advice, DYOR obviously – difficulty changes, token price swings, all the usual crypto risks. But for me, these 3-4 months have been positive: steady sats stacking, side income covering coffee and then some, and a fun new hobby.
What about you? How long have you been in, and what's your hashrate/rewards looking like these days? Anyone else gone from newbie to decent stack in a few months? Tips for pushing efficiency higher without dumping too much cash? Or how do you handle fees – all BTC auto-deduct or heavy on GOMINING discounts?

I run a small but growing London WhatsApp social group for people who actually want to meet in person rather than just chat online forever. We usually do relaxed things like coffee meetups and also fun activities around London.

We’ve got around 90+ people at the moment and recently did a coffee meetup in Covent Garden. This weekend we’re heading to Formula 1 Arcade and Babylon Theme Park.
The group is set up as a WhatsApp Community with separate chats for announcements, events and general chat, so it’s easy to mute things you’re not interested in.

Woke up irritated with the world. I’m bleeding so I’m presuming it’s PMS related but WTF. I’m on HRT for about 9 months now and I still wake up a few times every week at the crack of dawn. No, before the crack of dawn. Then sometimes I sleep so hard I’m groggy and struggle to get up.

I know HRT isn’t a cure for all the symptoms but I’m irritated that it’s not. Can’t I just be normal. Sleep like a normal human, wake up and feel normal, be productive and happy? 

I’m irritated about my daughter and her fiancé wanting to move out, shes 20. Seems like a stupid idea to me and I just know shes going to want to come back once she realizes I’m right. Because I am. I intellectually understand she is going to want to spread her wings and not live with her parents forever. Don’t leave, but also leave so I don’t have to share a kitchen with you anymore. It cant be easy living with a neurotic hormonal mom. I get it. 

I’m irritated at the state of the world. More like furious really. Why do we have these crusty old men in power. How do people not understand the world would be better off of if women were running the show. OH and what the F is wrong with the women who voted for them?! Are we that brainwashed? Who decided this was the game we all get to play, and why cant I opt out?

I feel crazy. I have this ridiculous belief that if everyone would just listen to me all would be well. Serious ego talking here. I am the oracle, all knowing, middle aged ego maniac who forgets how to spell words or where she put her coffee but I’ll fix YOUR life if you would just LISTEN.

-PCOS morphology, diagnosed endo and adenomyosis, massive cysts on both ovaries but 47 3-5mm cysts on my left 

-symptoms include 9/10 pain on first day and heavy bleeding and gastrointestinal symptoms (unable to poop solid, mucous in poop, BM every second day, no I am not starving myself I eat loads), extreme bloating,
and pretty strong depression and anxiety 

-Got put on combination birth control 
LIFE CHANGINGGGG I am constantly thinking “is this how normal people feel”
Pooping twice a day, no strain at all, soft and feel like they fall out perfect form 
Anxiety and depression and fatigue all gone 
Most notably virtually no bloat no matter what I eat or drink (I still get normal stomach pain when I drink too much coffee or do normal things lol) 

But on the sugar pill days it’s literally all back to how it was, feeling so ill I can’t get out of bed. Doctor recommended I don’t take the sugar pill but I have to bleed. I will get breakthrough bleeds

I am very anxious that my gi symptoms are pointing to something a bit more serious like cancer as I meet all but two of the ovarian cancer symptoms (I don’t get the premature feeling full and needing to pee all the time) especially as most posts on here and on the PCOS boards say they struggle with constipation and I have literally never struggled with it, I actually struggle to have a solid poop

1qbqi5j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qbqi5j,Vampire Archetype,"I have been having visions during active imagination where I would see a man leaned on against a rail drinking coffee.

I approached the individual and started talking to him. But it seemed to be extremely cold. It didnt even care that I was standing there. There was zero acknowledgement towards me. Then I went away and the vision ended.

After this happened I started grieving and crying. I realized that this part was a part of me. A cold and structurally strong. It is a part of me that has carried me through life.

Ill add two drawing I created around May when I this Archetype had a reason to surface.
Just to mentioned it and not further going into 
it, a therapist has abused me. She what I believe put me in trance almost and punctured somethung within me or atleast that is how it felt. Last experience left me patrified. Exactly the way Medusa stairs into her victims or The Basilisk from HP turns his victims into stone. Now this symbolic explanation to what I am living through. This is serieus and not a joke to me.

Here is the thing. This Vampire part is really cold, dark and violent. The best resemblance for it is meeting the Vampire Archetype pattern that was shaped by my own experiences through life. After this therapist crossed a boundary it feels like she broke a veil that he was behind or something. Since that experience I have had the most violent thoughts and thoughts about hurting her in many ways. Now understand this, this is really another part of me that has almost its own existance and powers. I have had difficulty restraining myself because I feel like because of what she did, she put me on the edge of a door. Almost like a Vampire not being capable to cross a certain boundary untill invited. Now from my own side I have something to say and the Vampire is also protector of the child in me. I once met him during active imagination. I went underground and knocked on his door. He received me and has been extremely kind and loving. He would not gepordice putting me in danger. So the tension and struggle is real.

Now people that cross a certain boundary with that part are in real danger. If there was no intermediary like the ego or the inner child or more beautiful parts of me. Chances are I would have already done something horific I believe. 

A bit more about this Archetypical Force. Imagine the dark side from Star Wars. This Vampire Archetype in me has abilities almost. I am capable to amplified my energetic field around me to the point of creating a massive field of will power that I could project onto other people. Its almost like using compulsion onto others. Now this is not something I have control over. Its rather the Archetypal energy washing over like a wave of energy. Like a big wave. I have noticed that my presence affects the energetic field around me. I have experienced before that people loose themself because occasionally it surfaces and projects this sort of energy without my knowledge. 

I wanted to share this as this has been such a complicated part about my life and or psyche it might be insightful for many to hear.

If you read this please feel free to share your stories with Vampire Archetype if you had to deal with it. I would be very interested to hear anything people have to say.

Also a very interesting find from few days back I actually found a book that described some historical events where Vampire have caused death my terrifying people. I believe it has all to do with this energy. Also I think this therapist has caused me so much harm and suffering becsuse of what happened. I have been going mad for past 10 months. Weirdly this reminds me of Mr. Harper in Dracula trilogy.

The good news is that many of the most commonly purchased plastic items already have durable, nontoxic, low-waste alternatives that are, in many cases, easy to find used.

Below is a list of high-impact plastic swaps that reduce waste and exposure to chemicals and microplastics. For the items you don't already own, this makes a great list to bring to your local thrift store!

Plastic grocery bags 🌼 

Swap for used cloth totes, backpacks, or baskets from home or a thrift store; these last for years and eliminate hundreds of bags.

Plastic produce bags 🌼 

Use reused paper bags, organic cotton produce bags, or simply place items directly in the cart.

Plastic food storage containers 🌼 

Replace with used glass jars, glass containers with metal clips, stainless containers, or reused glass packaging.

Plastic wrap or storage bags 🌼 

Store food in storage containers or bowls with plates on top.

Plastic sandwich bags 🌼 

Swap for reusable organic cloth bags, jars, or stainless containers.

Plastic freezer bags 🌼 

Freeze food in glass or stainless jars or containers.

Plastic water bottles 🌼 

Buy used 100% stainless steel or glass bottles.

Plastic dish sponges 🌼 

Replace with natural fiber scrubbers, wooden dish brushes with replaceable heads, or organic cotton or thrift store dishcloths.

Plastic trash bags 🌼 

Reduce need by composting food scraps** and use paper bags, reused packaging, or washable bin liners.

** storing food scraps in a sealed container in the freezer reduces trips to the compost bin (and its easy to make a flavorful homemade broth by freezing vegetable scraps like onion ends, carrot peels, and celery leaves separately then simmering with water, herbs (like bay leaves, thyme), and peppercorns (tip: exclude bitter scraps like broccoli or cabbage))

Plastic cleaning spray bottles 🌼 

Reuse glass bottles or durable spray bottles and refill with bulk, concentrated, or homemade biodegradable cleaners.

Plastic laundry detergent jugs 🌼 

Switch to biodegradable bulk powder, concentrated refills, or homemade detergent stored in glass jars.

Plastic shampoo and soap bottles 🌼 

Use nontoxic bar soap and shampoo bars sold in cardboard packaging, or refill durable containers from bulk sources.

Plastic toothbrushes 🌼 

Replace with bamboo or wood-handled toothbrushes with replaceable heads where possible.

Plastic toilet paper wrapping 🌼 

Replace with unbleached, recycled toilet paper that comes wrapped in recycled paper.

Plastic razors 🌼 

Use metal safety razors that last a lifetime with replaceable blades.

Plastic food packaging (snacks, staples) 🌼 

Buy bulk organic foods in your own containers; store at home in glass or stainless storage jars or containers or, for snacks, a used ceramic or glass cookie jar.

Plastic cutting boards 🌼 

Swap for used wood or bamboo cutting boards that can be hand washed, oiled, and occassionally sanded to last a lifetime.

Plastic kitchen utensils 🌼 

Buy used stainless steel, wood, or bamboo utensils that don’t melt or shed microplastics.

Plastic coffee makers or pods 🌼 

Buy used manual brewers made of glass, ceramic, or stainless steel and buy organic, shade-grown, fair trade coffee in bulk using your own containers. If morning preparation time is an issue, buy a used, plastic-free coffee machine with a reusable stainless steel filter screen then load the coffee and water at night and set the timer to brew the coffee in the morning.

Plastic tea bags 🌼 

Many tea bags contain plastic fibers or are sealed with plastic. Swap for organic, fair trade loose-leaf tea brewed in a used stainless steel infuser, mesh strainer, or teapot, and buy tea in bulk or paper packaging.

Plastic soap dispensers 🌼 

Buy or reuse secondhand glass or ceramic dispensers and refill using biodegradable liquid soap concentrates like castille soap. Or switch to nontoxic bar soap that comes unpackaged or in paper packaging and buy a used ceramic or glass self-draining soap dish to extend the life of the soap.

Plastic children’s toys 🌼 

Choose used wooden toys, books, puzzles, or secondhand items. Consider holding toy swaps with friends or neighbors.

Plastic air fresheners 🌼 

Use ventilation, dried herbs, organic essential oil drops on reusable materials, or essential oil drops with water in a glass spray bottle.

Plastic plant pots 🌼 

Buy plants from nurseries that use biodegradable containers and plant in used terracotta, ceramic, wood, or metal containers. Consider instead swapping plant cuttings with friends or neighbors using reusable containers and soil from the garden.

Plastic garden edging or decor 🌼 

Use stone, brick, salvaged wood, or metal edging reclaimed from construction or landscaping reuse centers.

Plastic lawn chairs and outdoor furniture 🌼 

Buy used wood or metal furniture and refinish; these can last decades instead of seasons.

Plastic storage bins 🌼 

Use secondhand storage bins, wooden or metal crates, or cardboard boxes reinforced for long-term use. Consider donating items that are slated for long-term storage to reduce resource consumption. A good question to ask before storing an item: if you moved, would you spend the money and effort to take it with you or would it be donated in the pre-move decluttering project.

Why These Swaps Matter 🌼

Most of these alternatives are not only more sustainable, but cheaper over time because they don’t need frequent replacement.

1qbqhm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qbqhm2/first_footing_has_got_my_2026_off_to_quite_a/,"First Footing has got my 2026 off to quite a start, and I don’t know what to do anymore","It's only been thirteen days into 2026 and I am about 83% sure I have already completely, utterly ruined it. On the plus side, I am not so sure I will ever have to worry about another year again. 

It all started with this damned The Old Farmer's Almanac article. During a fine evening of phone-in-bed doomscrolling, I came across a news post proclaiming that Farmers' Almanac was closing up shop, and confused it for The Old Farmer's Almanac. Thankfully, several commenters (with varying degrees of civility) had set me on the straight and narrow, and I knew my favorite witchy guide to the moons and seasons would be around for another year. And what a horrific year 2025 had been for me. First, my cat died. Sure, he was seventeen, but that just made me sadder. I'd had him since I was seven and had gotten to move out with him. Then, my boyfriend left for another girl, and now she's pregnant. My own mother said ""Hey, at least he didn't cheat"" when he left in February (what a way to pregame Valentine's Day!) and ""Oh! Good for him! How exciting!"" when news of the pregnancy broke around Thanksgiving. After that breakup, my annual physical in April revealed pre-diabetes and further tests showed that I had autoantibodies against my own pancreas. That means I am basically very slowly developing type 1 diabetes (though they call it LADA or Type 1.5). After systemically removing every bit of joy from my diet (keto cupcakes just aren't the same), I am proud to say that my doctor put me on insulin in October because it did sweet f all.

I don't mean to sound like the whiniest crybaby on the block. I just want you all to understand why I did what I did when I read on The Old Farmer's Almanac about an old New Year's practice called First Footing. It's a superstition that, as far as I've read, has existed in many parts of Europe as well as some parts of Asia. Whoever visits your home first on New Year's determines your luck. A tall, dark, (and presumably handsome!) male stranger is ideal, while a fair-haired man is less ideal. My ex, who was definitely the first one in this efficiency apartment on 1/1/25, was a blonde. Figured. 

How could I ensure a tall, dark, handsome man came in, who I did not yet know? In a wonderful display of self-preservation and fantastic judgement, especially as a young lady in the big ol' city, I placed an ad on Craigslist. It called for a tall, dark, handsome stranger to bring a silver coin to my apartment on New Year's Day, and stay for some coffee and homebaked pastries. I posted it on Christmas Eve, because the most adjusted males in the city were clearly going to be scrolling Craigslist on Christmas instead of hanging out with family (I swear I am not usually this dumb). Maybe they celebrated Chaunukah or Yule or friggin Festivus instead (if I am lucky), and they'd be perfectly adjusted! 

I got a response on Boxing Day, a text from a number with a local area code. 

""Saw your ad. Happy to oblige. Grandfather was a coin collector. Got a good one for you. I know we gotta be strangers though so I'll keep myself under wraps til New Year's!""

My mother would cloister me away for the rest of my natural life if she knew that I replied to this man with ""Sounds great, thanks!"" followed by my address. 

On New Year's Day, I sat on my couch, rapt attention on my door until there was finally a light tap on it. 9:03am per my phone. Hey, he was pretty punctual! This may work out! 

The man in the doorway was indeed tall, dark, and handsome, but he was also the least memorable person I have ever laid eyes on. If you've ever seen those posts that average all photographs of men/women from different regions, he looked exactly like one of them. His features were in perfect proportion, perfect ratio, and perfect symmetry. He smiled, revealing Colgate-white teeth. He handed me a silver coin of a denomination I did not recognize and still do not (and boy, have I tried to find it). The characters on it were some sort of symbol-based language, but not one I'd ever seen before. The man on the coin, sailing on a raft of some sort, looked remarkably like our Tall, Dark, Handsome Stranger but clearly wasn't him. He was taller, more defined, and wore his hair in a long braid, with squiggles on his skin that I took to be tattoos. On the back of it, there was a little fox-like animal that almost appeared to be smiling. I smiled in turn, almost sheepishly thanking him. 

Our coffee was nice, but quiet. I tried a few times to spark off a conversation, but he answered in short, generic, yet friendly sentences. At 10:00 on the dot, he slapped his knees suddenly, stood up, offered a handshake, and said ""Gotta run! Your year should go your way now, Miss"". Oh how I hoped he was right at the time. 

The first sign of anything odd (god I can't believe this was only thirteen days ago) was just an hour later, when I checked my blood sugar. Gotta give a really quick crash course on diabetes here (don't take medical advice from girls who let strangers into their apartments). Normal blood sugar is about 70 to 140. My goal range was 80 to 120. I was on two types of insulin. Long acting Lantus and short acting Lispro. Lantus is always there in the background while Lispro compensates for meals. Despite being a Very Bad Diabetic and eating a Danish with nothing but long acting Lantus onboard, my blood sugar was a healthy 79. It should have been 250 at the lowest. I reluctantly ate a sandwich without insulin. At this point, my sugar should have been at least 300. Yet on recheck, it was 92. At this point, I grabbed a whole chocolate bar and ate it. Rechecked my sugar, and it was 112. An hour later, it was 87. This has held up. I haven't injected a drop of insulin since before I went to bed on New Year's Eve, and my blood sugar has never been higher than 126. I am eating like a raccoon in a dumpster, keto-be-damned. 

The second sign of anything odd was the morning of January 2, so eleven days ago. My upstairs neighbor was tapdancing at 5am. I know people say that metaphorically, usually due to the acoustics of apartment buildings, but I mean that literally. Ruth Barry was a tapdancing instructor and performer, and she was practicing. She was highly annoying about it. Our landlord had even cleared a spot and made her a little studio in the basement-it was a real labor of love, too. I saw him down there with his wife and college-aged daughters painstakingly putting it together, from sanding and finishing the wood floor to installing a bar and mirror. Ruth, who ought to be called Karen, decided that she ""didn't like the feng shui"" of the place. Still, I wish that I had thought ""I wish Ruth would use that beautiful little studio"". Instead, I thought ""I wish that entitled nuisance would drop dead."" I didn't mean it. I really didn't. But I thought it, and I guess I thought it hard enough. The obit isn't live yet, but she died moments later. I heard the thud. My annoyance turned to worry, and I knew deep within my gut that I was the cause. The rest of that day is a blur, and I won't bore you with the details. 

The only thing I can figure is that the man on the raft on the coin is steering the ship of fate, and, now that I've got the coin, I am at the healm. I do not, however, want the responsibility, especially since frivolous thoughts seem to drive it as effectively as well-crafted, well-considered ones. 

To make matters worse, I do think there is something malevolent about it. First, I tried to use it to eradicate cancer. No dice. Second, I tried to use it to cure an individual's cancer (searched through GoFundMe), also no dice, which was strange to me because of my diabetes. 

It has only been thirteen days, and I am responsible for two additional deaths. 

The first was careless again. I wished an annoying drunk cyclist circling outside the complex would go away, and apparently, that means forever. Moments later, he meandered into the road and was almost instantly killed by a car. May have been a coincidence but I don't think so. 

The second was haunting. My next door neighbor Cyndy is an angel without wings, but she works too hard for too little (there's a Cyndy in every apartment complex I'd venture). She endeavors to provide for her son, whom she dotes upon. I wished for a financial windfall for her, as well as financial freedom. 

One of her jobs offered life insurance for both her and her son. I bet you can guess what happened. 

Cyndy hasn't left the apartment since, but I can hear her wailing sobs each day through the paper thin walls. Rumor has it he had an undetected heart defect. I know better. And I don't know how to exist in society without endangering others anymore.  ",10,1768308674.0,nosleep,0,0.86,False

1qbqetb,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1qbqetb/i_just_launched_nametag_a_personal_relationships/,I just launched Nametag: A personal relationships manager,"Hey r/SaaS! Launched my micro-SaaS. It's a personal relationships manager that helps people track their network, remember birthdays, and visualize connections.

**The product:** Nametag (https://nametag.one)

**What it does:**
- Track people with flexible attributes
- Map relationships between people
- Visualize personal network as interactive graph
- Set reminders for birthdays and staying in touch
- Organize contacts into custom groups


It's also open source:

- **Hosted SaaS:** Free tier (50 people), paid plans $1/$3/$5 per month
- **Open source:** Self-host for unlimited contacts (AGPL-3.0)

**Why this works:**

*Revenue perspective:*
- SaaS provides MRR to sustain development
- $1/month entry point reduces friction
- Paid tiers for power users
- Predictable revenue model

*Marketing perspective:*
- Open source drives GitHub stars, SEO, trust
- Self-hosters like the product
- Two marketing channels: SaaS community + OSS community
- Developer credibility from inspectable code

*User perspective:*
- Convenience users choose hosted
- Privacy users choose self-hosted
- Both groups are satisfied
- No feature compromises for either group


**Pricing strategy:**

Struggled with this. Landed on:
- **Free:** 50 people (good enough to be useful, limited enough to encourage upgrades)
- **Starter ($1/mo):** 1000 people (impulse-buyable, coffee price)
- **Plus ($2/mo):** Unlimited people (for power users)

$1/month feels like the sweet spot - low commitment, easy conversion.


**Challenges:**

1. **Supporting both models** - Same codebase needs to work for SaaS and self-hosted
2. **Pricing anxiety** - Is $1 too cheap?
3. **Email deliverability** - Using Resend, still optimizing
4. **GitHub support burden** - Self-hosters need help too

**Questions for r/SaaS:**

- Anyone else running open source + SaaS? How's it going?
- Thoughts on $1/month entry pricing?
- How do you balance supporting free tier users?
- Best practices for pricing tiers?

Would love feedback, especially on pricing and the dual model approach!

1qbqdil,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qbqdil,Kaffebox advent calendar review,"Finished my first coffee advent calendar and wanna write some notes about it 🫰

First of all, it was wonderful experience and I definitely want to try more advent calendars next year 

I would like to say that Kaffebox is really good for pourover, previously I have read some reviews of Onyx calendar with some criticism that the roast was too dark for pourover and matches espresso more. Don't know if it's true or not, but Kaffebox fits pourover well

Three favourite door of calendar:
Door 1 with geisha, Colombia from Pala roastery. Good start with clear and light cup with mild acidity
Door 21 with co-fermented Colombia from Jacu roastery. My first cup of co-fermented beans at home and when I have just opened it and smelled the bean's aroma, I thought: ""okay, I don't really know what ""co-fermented"" means, but it is definitely co-fermented"". Previously I have tried fermented beans only in coffeeshops, so I didn't expect such a strong aroma before I even started to brew
Door 16, Kenya from Coffee Collective. I have heard a lot about Coffee Collective, but have never tried their coffee before. First door with their coffee wasn't so interesting to me (it's a matter of preference, of course), but this one was just right. Strong acidity, good sweetness, bright and juicy

What I also discovered from this calendar, is my new favorite recipy from Pala roastery that they advice to use with their coffee, but it worked well with another beans too in my experiments:
45 second bloom with 10% of water, use wdt or spoon to saturate all grounds
0:45-1:30: pour 90% of total water amount in one long, steady pour
1:30-2:15: drawdown. Immediately after last drop of water: use spoon and carefully stir 2 circles in the slurry to create a slow vortex that will prevent high and dry grounds. Total brew time 2:15-2:30

Looks like this using of wdt/spoon was crucial to the success, really recommend to try

If you try to offer also a little criticism, I would like to notice that maybe if you have already tried a lot sweet cups and in general prefer acidity, you can find a lot of doors a little bit boring. I think that more than a half of doors more on the sweetness side and body. For me it was good, despite the fact that I like acidity more than sweetness, because I experimented a lot with sweetness in the end and looks like I found new ways to enjoy my sweet cup with a strong body. Moreover, I believe that after this calendar, under the guidance of roasteries, their recommendations for every door and also videos from Marco D'Ottavio with Kaffebox calendar, I just understood more about sweetness and learned how to brew it better than I did earlier. So, of course, as usual, even criticism can be advantage for someone ",13,1768308332.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

1qbqbg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1qbqbg7/travelling_to_france_here_are_some_french/,Travelling to France? Here are some french etiquette and customs for tourists & expats,"France is my homeland, a lovely country for tourists and expats, and I remember to have this discussion with foreigners several times

So here is a list of french ""etiquette"" and customs to have in mind if you ever plan to visit the country (and you should!) and break some wrong reputation and stereotypes too

This probably won't be an exhaustive list as I'm french, some things I do by habits might be considered special for a foreigner haha feel free to ask anything in comments and hope this might help few people :)

\- **Feel free to try french language**. This is a wrong stereotype, but most of french people will love to have you try french, especially as outside of Paris/touristic spots and the majority of 50+ won't speak english. The only places I wouldn't advice to try french is in crowded touristic areas because the waiters, shopkeepers, reception... might have to deal with tons of other tourists and english will make it easier for everyone during the rush.  
""Bonjour"" ""Merci"" ""Au revoir"" and ""S'il vous plait"" are the minimum politeness words you should learn, but you will go far with only this!

\- **Entering/Leaving a shop.** Speaking of french language, here we always use ""Bonjour"" (hello) and ""Au revoir"" (goodbye) when entering and leaving a shop. Even if we don't plan to buy anything. It is considered rude not to do it (exception with big malls / supermarkets)  
Note: to have a good pronunciation of Bonjour and Au revoir, the R sound should be done with your throat (like german) and not your tongue (like spanish)

\- **Tipping.** Here waiters in restaurants or bar usually have a good salary. Tips aren't mandatory but always welcomed if you are happy with the service. You can round the bill up if you wish to!  
Also prices on the bar / restaurant menu are including the tax, so no bad surprise.

\- **France isn't only Paris** and all of french outside the capital will tell you the same. All regions have a distinct culture, and life / people in Paris are very different from the other places. And more rural the place is, more negative their opinion will be toward Paris and parisians (in a funny way mainly, not proper hate)  
Some region will be even more proud to say they are not french but from their region first (Britanny, Corsica, South West / Basque mainly) as they have a strong local culture.

\- **Greeting.** Okay this is an actual big topic.   
To greet a complete stranger, like a shopkeeper, waiter, random people in the street, police officer, museum or hotel reception... you just say **""Bonjour"" with eventually a a little nod of the head** (not mandatory)  
  
To greet someone you meet sometimes, like a colleague, a regular customer/bartender, friend of friends, neightboor... someone you are unfamiliar with, **you shake hands**, same for women, especially in work environement.  
  
To greet a good friend, you can ""**faire la bise**"" which consist of brushing the other person's cheek with your own lightly one each side, from 2 to 4 times (depends on the region, they do it more in the south of France, most popular is 2 times) or hug the person. La bise is traditionally woman to woman and man to woman, while man to man shake hands or hug, but this is becoming more and more usual thing between 2 good male friends.

If you don't really know what to do, you can just handshake, this is a good middle neutral ground haha  
Greeting is super common, and in small villages and rural areas, you can say ""Bonjour"" to anyone you might walk by

\- **Metro in big cities.** More and more big french cities have a metro (Paris, Toulouse, Lyon Marseilles Rennes...) In the metro you should leave your place to elders, handicaped people, mothers with children and pregnant women. Also you should place your backpack on the ground if the metro is crowded. On automatic stairs, ALWAYS stay on the right side, especially in Paris, so the people in hurry can run on the left side.

\- **Asking people in the street.** We have the undeserved reputation of being rude at strangers. You can ask pretty much everyone in the street for direction or help. Just say ""Bonjour, excusez-moi"" (hello excuse me) with a smile and ""Parlez-vous anglais?"" (Do you speak english?) and 99% people will gladly help you (exception in Paris where people might think you ask them for money and decide not to give attention, small chances of happening but if it happens I'm sorry for you, don't take it too personnaly and try again with another person, people in Paris are more used to individualist behaviour and usually when someone try to get their attention in the street it is for money).

\- **Coffee culture**. We have a big coffee culture, you can drink coffee pretty much at any time during the day. Typical french person will drink a coffee in the morning (alone or group), at bar terrace in big cities or at homen and after a meal. In workplace, usually around 10am-10.30am you have a ""coffee pause"" (french: Pause Café) while you grab a cup of coffee with colleagues and share a more informal moment with them by chatting

\- **Apéro**. ""prendre un verre"" (grab a glass) or ""Apéro"" is an informal moment where you can share small snacks and grab a beer or strong alcohol with colleagues after work or before diner, usually at bar's terraces in cities. Here everyone speaks more freely about themselves or their opinion (see Debating below for more detailed info)  
It is common if you invite or are invited at a friend's house to do an Apéro before eating diner

**- Debating.** French people love debating and can share opinion on tons of topics. They often speak on how disapointed or unhappy they are with something happening in order to debates about it, that is a reason why people see us as complaining about everything, but this is more a way to start a debate than an actual complaint, and participates in debates is a good way to have deeper connexion with a french person.  
Apéro are usually the common moment for such debates - also keep in mind that some topics are pretty sensitive, especially politics (blaming Macron will get everyone to agree tho hahaha). In france we also have a lot of different ethnicities from immigration, but also sadly growing racism, so be careful with bringing those topics in discussions. Salaries and religions are also considered impolite topics unless you are close friend with the person.

**- Public talking and noise**. It is consider pretty rude to speak loud, especially in confined spaces (elevator, metro, train...) and museums. Not really in the street. If you have a phone call during a train ride you should leave the train car to answer your call.

I think this is a pretty good start, feel free to ask any question or share any other customs you might have in mind :)",33,1768308163.0,travel,26,0.73,False

1qbq70y,https://www.reddit.com/r/toxicparents/comments/1qbq70y/stepmom_doesnt_allow_me_to_gift_things_to_my_dad/,Stepmom doesn’t allow me to gift things to my Dad and Stepbrother,"This has happened throughout my life. I am currently F27, my Dad is in his 60s and Stepmom 50s. 

When my step brother was younger (he’s about 15 years younger than me) I would buy him gifts and then a week lately they would mysteriously disappear. Same for gifts to my Dad.

So this year, I bought my Dad a digital frame. I live in America while my Dad lives in Asia. So this digital frame was going to be a fun way for me to transfer photos onto the frame so he can see what I’m up to in America and what not. When I visited them a week later, the frame was on the coffee table and not plugged in. When my stepmom left the room, my Dad whispered to me that his wife was paranoid and so he can’t use the digital frame. My stepmom believes that my Mom will have access to any of the photos on the frame, including one’s of my Dad’s family since I taught him how to upload photos himself. I tried to reassure him that that would not be the case, and I can even make it so that it’s just picture of me and my life in America, so they don’t have to upload any photos of themselves. But he basically said “do troublesome don’t worry about it”- essentially I know that my stepmom has made it clear the gift can’t stay. 

My stepmom used to be my mom’s best friend, to the point she was actually my godmother. And then my dad and her had an affair. And it was a very long and drawn out divorce that happened. So there’s huge amount of hurt feelings all around. That was twenty years ago. (Too much happened can’t get into it) 

I’m frustrated at my stepmom because she really is kind of evil. And I’m deeply hurt and frustrated in my Dad. I feel like he appreciates the gift but is so scared of standing up to her or creating any conflict that he won’t stand up for me or anything. 

Anyone else have a difficult stepmom?

TLDR: step mom so paranoid that she won’t allow my dad to use my gift - a digital frame- because she thinks my mom will have access to photos. Not sure what she thinks mom will do with photos even if she could see them. ",3,1768307795.0,toxicparents,0,0.81,False
1qbq6ue,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1qbq6ue/i_practiced_flirting_with_women_for_30_days_and/,I practiced flirting with women for 30 days and here's what actually worked (and what spectacularly failed),"I've always been the guy who freezes up around attractive women. The guy who thinks of the perfect thing to say 3 hours later. The guy watching others effortlessly create connection and chemistry while I stand awkwardly in the corner wondering what secret handbook everyone else received at birth.

So I decided to run an experiment: 30 days of deliberate flirting practice. No pickup lines or manipulation tactics just genuine interactions with a specific focus on building romantic tension and expressing interest clearly. I committed to at least one flirtatious interaction daily, tracked what happened, and documented patterns.

What followed was equal parts humbling, educational, and occasionally mortifying. But by day 30, something had fundamentally shifted in how I communicate with women I'm attracted to.

Here's what I learned:

Days 1-7: The awkward phase

My first week was a masterclass in what NOT to do. In my head, I sounded smooth. In reality, I was a human cringe compilation.

Day 1: Tried complimenting a barista on her earrings and somehow ended up in a three-minute monologue about my aunt's jewelry collection. She looked genuinely concerned for my wellbeing.

Day 4: Attempted ""playful teasing"" with a woman at the gym. Called her form ""interesting"" during kettlebell swings. She thought I was a trainer about to correct her technique. When I clarified I was flirting, she just said ""Oh"" and walked away. After that I was considered moving to another country (IT WAS EMBARASSING!)

The first week pattern was clear: I was overthinking, overtalking, and overcomplicated everything. I was treating flirtation like a performance rather than a conversation.

Days 8-14: The learning period

During week two, I noticed my first substantial shifts by making one critical change: I stopped thinking about what to say and focused entirely on how to listen.

Day 9: Had a conversation with a woman at a bookstore about the novel she was holding. Instead of trying to impress her with my literary knowledge, I asked genuine questions about what drew her to that author. The conversation flowed naturally for 15 minutes, ending with her suggesting a coffee shop nearby.

Day 12: Made eye contact with a woman at the farmer's market, smiled, then commented on the unique tomatoes she was selecting. Instead of immediately launching into conversation, I let comfortable silence exist between comments. The interaction had a completely different rhythm relaxed, dynamic, and mutually engaged.

The winning formula started becoming clear: curiosity + presence + patience = chemistry. I was learning that flirtation isn't about what you say but the energy you create.

Days 15-22: Earned confidence

By mid-experiment, patterns were emerging about what consistently worked versus what consistently failed.

What consistently failed:

Anything that felt like a ""line"" or prepared statement

Complimenting physical appearance as an opener

Trying to demonstrate value or intelligence

Any interaction where I was focused on the outcome rather than the moment

What consistently worked:

Genuine observations about something in our shared environment

Playful (but kind) banter that created emotional ping-pong

Light, brief touch at appropriate moments (like a touch on the arm during laughter)

Comfortable silence with maintained eye contact

The biggest revelation came on Day 19 at a friend's dinner party. I realized I was no longer ""practicing flirting"" I was just connecting with people while allowing attraction to exist without hiding it. My friend later told me that a woman had asked about me after the party, something that had rarely happened before.

Days 23-30: The outcome phase

The final week brought a profound insight: Effective flirting isn't a separate communication mode it's regular conversation with the volume turned up on certain elements:

More precise eye contact

Slightly more personal questions

More expressive reactions to their stories

More comfort with silence

More willingness to show vulnerability mixed with confidence

Day 26: Had lunch next to a woman at a café counter. Our conversation flowed from weather to travel to life philosophies without effort. When we eventually exchanged numbers, it felt like the natural next step rather than a nerve-wracking goal. What differed wasn't what I said but how comfortable I was expressing authentic interest.

Day 30: Went to a social event and found myself flirting effortlessly with multiple women throughout the evening. Not because I was trying to ""score"" but because I'd developed a comfort with expressing attraction as part of normal human interaction. All those cringe moments became worth it.

After 30 days, hundreds of interactions, and meticulous tracking of what worked and what didn't, here are the most valuable insights I gained:

Intention Is Loud

Women can sense the difference between someone talking to them because they're generally interesting versus someone talking to them with an agenda. The interactions that went well were ones where I was genuinely curious rather than outcome-focused.

2. Tension needs space

Early on, I'd fill every silence with more words. I later realized that romantic tension actually lives in the spaces between words the brief eye contact, the slight smile, the unspoken understanding. Allowing these moments to breathe was game-changing.

3. Escalation is subtle

Effective flirting is about small shifts in proximity, personal disclosure, and playfulness. The most powerful connections happened through a series of micro-escalations that were almost imperceptible individually but significant collectively.

4. Rejection is information, not failure

Early rejections sent me into spirals of self-criticism. Later rejections simply became data points. Not everyone will be attracted to you, and that's valuable information that saves everyone's time.

5. Inner state trumps technique

The single biggest factor in successful interactions wasn't what I said but how I felt saying it. On confident, grounded days, even mundane conversations developed chemistry. On insecure days, even my best material fell flat.

Would I recommend this challenge?

Absolutely but with caveats. Just make sure to not quit after the 1st week because it's the hardest to overcome especially with self-criticism but after that it's a fun experience to have. We only live once after all,

The true transformation wasn't becoming ""better at flirting"" but becoming more comfortable with myself in romantic contexts. The awkwardness never completely disappears (and honestly, a little awkwardness can be endearing), but the fear around it does.

When you stop seeing flirting as a performance and start seeing it as enhanced human connection, something clicks into place that changes not just your dating life but your relationship with yourself.

Has anyone else tried something similar? What did you learn about yourself in the process? Well I realized women are also humans (lol) and that it's all a numbers game and it's all practice",12,1768307779.0,MotivationByDesign,0,0.87,False

1qbq6az,https://i.redd.it/xvci5pmr24dg1.png,Tascas: Traditional Portuguese Restaurants and What to Order,"
A tasca is a small, family-run Portuguese restaurant where tradition matters more than design. They’re the kind of places where the chairs might not match, but the food and atmosphere are unforgettable. The portions are generous, the prices are fair, and the recipes often haven’t changed in decades.
There's no fancy menus, in many tascas it’s handwritten and not always translated.The dish of the day (prato do dia) is what locals usually go for, and when it’s served in a clay pot (tacho de barro), it’s almost always a winner. Dishes like arroz de cabidela (rice with chicken and its blood), favas com entrecosto (broad beans with pork ribs), feijoada (bean stew with meat), arroz de gambas (prawn rice) or cozido à portuguesa (slow-cooked meat and vegetables) are classics you’ll find throughout the country.
If you’re unsure what to choose, a bitoque is a safe option: a thin beef steak topped with a fried egg, served with fries, rice, and garlic gravy. 

To drink, you can usually order beer, or wine. I normally go for the house wine (vinho da casa), it’s not always the best you’ll ever taste, but in a tasca it becomes part of the tradition. It’s often served in a simple jug, poured without fuss, and somehow just feels right with the meal.

If you still have space after the main course, the desserts are a trip into Portuguese tradition: arroz doce (sweet rice pudding), pudim de ovos (egg pudding – my favourite), baba de camelo (caramel mousse), mousse de chocolate, or farófias (egg whites in sweet milk). And in most tascas, you’ll also start your meal with a steaming bowl of soup.

One thing to know: if bread, cheese, or olives are placed on your table, they’re not complimentary. You only pay if you eat them.

The bill is often between 10€–15€ for a full meal with dish of the day, drink, dessert, and coffee. Eating on a tasca  it’s about feeling the rhythm of everyday Portugal, sitting side by side with locals, and tasting recipes that have been passed down through generations.

For non Arabic speakers:

My residence is located next to a bus stop pole. I leave my home daily at a fixed time in order to catch the bus according to its schedule. The location consists of a street intersection with traffic signals, followed by the beginning of the sidewalk where the bus stop pole is located.

There are three traffic signals at this intersection; however, none of them are equipped with a Saher traffic monitoring system. In addition, there is a noticeable absence of police patrols, traffic police, or any form of law enforcement presence in this neighborhood and on this specific street.

Today, an individual began monitoring me from the traffic signal area and followed me until I reached the bus stop pole. He stopped his vehicle next to me and continued harassing me without leaving. At the time, I was holding a cup of coffee, which I opened and poured toward him in self-defense. During the verbal exchange, I said to him, verbatim:
“But what you are doing to me is inappropriate.”
He replied, and I responded by saying:
“Isn’t it inappropriate for you to follow a woman who could be your daughter?”

He then opened his car door as if he were about to step out. As a precautionary reaction, I poured the remaining coffee toward him. He immediately closed the door, started his vehicle, verbally insulted me, and fled the scene.

Due to the speed of the incident, I was unable to photograph the vehicle or fully document the first harassment. Seconds later, another individual approached, commented on the incident, and quickly drove away before I could react further. I was able to photograph this second vehicle and recorded the license plate details to the best of my memory. Unfortunately, I was not able to do the same with the first individual.

I intended to submit a report through the “Kollona Amn” application; however, it was not installed on my phone at the time. As I was on my way to work and concerned about being late, I decided to download it later. I then attempted to contact Riyadh Traffic Services. The first call resulted in a busy signal, and the second call was unanswered. I later contacted the national traffic emergency number and was redirected to the Riyadh department.

During my call, the employee was not cooperative, interrupted my explanation, and asked whether the issue was a general traffic matter. I explained clearly that I wanted to submit a report due to the lack of police presence and the absence of Saher systems at the traffic signals in the area where the incident occurred. I was briefly told to visit Al-Malaz Police Station and that they would register the report there.

Because I do not have video or audio evidence, and as my testimony is personal, I was concerned that my complaint might not be taken seriously. Additionally, the incident occurred at the very beginning of the sidewalk, where there are no nearby shops or facilities with surveillance cameras that could be used as supporting evidence. There are also no Saher systems installed at the traffic signals in that location.

I am writing to seek guidance on the correct procedures I can take to strengthen this report. My explicit and primary goal in submitting these reports is to ensure increased police patrols and traffic authority presence in this area, in order to prevent future harassment or assaults and to enhance public safety for pedestrians and commuters.",10,1768307549.0,Riyadh,31,0.73,False

My ""stats"" are 5'10"" and 165lbs. I'm a highly motivated person, constantly striving for improvement and challenging my own beliefs. I've built a life I'm pretty proud of atm, I work as a chemical operator which I can see myself doing till I retire. When I'm not at work, I go for runs, hit the gym regularly, and playing with my pit/lab mix named Strider (yes, as in LOTR).

I'm a bit of a nerd, so fantasy is a huge thing for me—from Lord of the Rings movies to the annual Harry Potter marathon around the holidays. I visit the local renaissance fair (we should dress up!)so it would be cool if we could bond over that! I also love to travel, read history books, and try new restaurant/coffee shops, hanging with friends, and music festivals.

What I'm Looking For

I’m a big hopeless romantic so take that for what it’s worth! I think fundamentally, even if we don't share the exact same hobbies, having the same goals and a similar future outlook is most important. I'm looking for a partner to share in the small, intimate moments that make a relationship special:

\- Weekend cuddles and lazy mornings

\- Evening coffee shop reading dates

\- Random road trips and hitting the gym together

\- Holding hands at the farmer’s market or snuggling in a hammock (I’m super affectionate in private and in public).

I'm an inquisitive person, so I tend to ask a lot of questions. I don't mind calling whenever you're comfortable because conversations typically flow better that way for me.

I’m open to long-distance relationships (in the US only), but my ultimate goal is for us to eventually move in together, relocation to me is ideal.

If any of this resonates with you, I’d love to hear from you! I'll probably only respond if your open to sharing a pic within the first message or two so we can see if the attraction is mutual, i do have preferences for partners who have are slim/thin or lean towards the athletic/fit side and ideally over 25 but not a deal breaker.
