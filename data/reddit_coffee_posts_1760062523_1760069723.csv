In a fast-paced, technology-dominated, loud world, peace and imagination won't necessarily be forthcoming. But imagine there was a simple, affordable, deeply fulfilling activity that would soothe your mind, hone your concentration, and reconnect you with your inner kid. That's precisely what coloring books offer ‚Äî a timeless, cheerful tool that's no longer the exclusive preserve of children."".

Adult coloring books are now among the globe's most well-liked self-care activities, and it's easy to see why. Whether you need to relax, get crafty, or take a quiet break from your phone, purchasing an adult coloring book is one step you won't regret.

In this new post, we'll find why owning a coloring book is a must, how it benefits your mind and body, and how it can add joy, healing, and mindfulness to your daily life.

**1. Coloring Books Are More Than Just a Hobby**

Most people think that coloring books are solely for children, but modern psychology and research suggest otherwise. Coloring is a therapeutic art that allows people of all ages to relax and focus. When you color, your brain releases dopamine ‚Äî the ""feel-good"" hormone ‚Äî that allows for less anxiety and more happiness.

Coloring permits you to take it slow. It enables you to do something hands-on, calming, and imaginative ‚Äî a relief from scrolling through your phone or staring at a screen.

Purchasing a coloring book or pages is not just agreeing to paper and designs; it's agreeing to one's own sanity, more creativity, and mental health.

**2. The Science Behind Coloring: A Mental Health Booster**

Coloring has a surprising amount of scientific backing. Studies show that coloring more complex designs, such as mandalas, floral patterns, or geometric shapes, can always reduce stress and improve mood. Psychologists have found that coloring activates the same parts of the brain involved in meditation ‚Äî the areas responsible for focus, relaxation, and creative expression.

When you color, your mind gets out of high-state ""fight or flight"" and into a more relaxed ""rest and digest"" mode. That's why so many find coloring books to be an excellent anxiety-reducer, depression manager, or just a way to relax after a tough day at work.

**Coloring also accomplishes the following:**

Lower stress hormones (cortisol)

* Improve concentration
* Bring about more mindfulness.
* Encourage emotional release

Keeping a coloring book handy means you have a mental health tool at your fingertips when things get overwhelming.

**3. Coloring Fosters Mindfulness and Meditation**

Mindfulness is merely being here in the moment ‚Äî paying attention to your inner thoughts, feelings, and sensations without judgment. Coloring naturally fosters mindfulness because it requires more focus and good patience.

As you fill in shapes with color, your mind begins to quiet down. You start noticing the details: the texture of paper, the smoothness of your pencils, the flow of your hand. This gentle rhythm becomes a form of meditation that brings deep relaxation.

While traditional meditation can be difficult for some, coloring is a less active gateway to mindfulness. It gives your hands something to do, and your mind stays in the here and now.¬†

Having a coloring book handy means that you can integrate mindfulness into your everyday life ‚Äî even if you color for only ten minutes a day.

**4. Connect with Your Inner Child**

How much time has passed since you did something just for fun ‚Äî no expectations, no rules, no pressure to ""be productive""? Coloring lets you play again.

We adults forget how to be a kid. A coloring book reminds you of it. It takes you back to a time when you didn't have to think so much to be creative, and it was perfectly fine to mess up. You can be bold in color, experiment with wild patterns, or simply doodle ‚Äî no wrong here at coloring time.

This artistic play is profoundly therapeutic. It reminds you that life isn't always perfect ‚Äî it's about expression and fun.

So when you buy a coloring book, you're not really buying artwork ‚Äî you're buying the chance to unplug and find your inner child.

**5. A Screen-Free Escape in a Digital World**

We're on screens for hours a day in our hectic, tech-filled lives. Phones, computers, and TV screens have all played their part in digital overstimulation, a silent stress.

Coloring books provide the best remedy. They take a load off your eyes and mind. When you color, you're disconnected from notifications, social media, and emails. You're concentrating on something real ‚Äî the touch of a pencil, paper texture, and the aesthetics of color combinations.

Many people find that 15-20 minutes of coloring before bed helps them always relax and fall asleep more easily. It's a budget-friendly, screen-free, stress-reducing great habitt you can access anywhere, anytime.

**6. Enhance Your Creativity and Imagination**

Even if you don't consider yourself an artist, coloring books challenge your creativity. You get to make artistic decisions ‚Äî choosing color pairings, blending hues, and establishing visual balance. That activates the right side of your brain, which is all about inventiveness and imagination.

With time, coloring regularly can make your mind creative, even in other areas of life. You may become more creative at work, more problem-solving, or braver in the art world.

And don't forget ‚Äî there are coloring books for every theme under the sun! From whimsical worlds of magic to cozy scenes at home, mandalas, flowers, garden scenes, and even works of art ‚Äî there's one that suits your own special personality and flair.

**7. Coloring Increases Attention to Detail and Patience**

Patience is the last thing in a world of instant gratification. Coloring teaches you to slow down and enjoy the process rather than rush to the finish.

When you color, you're practicing attention to detail, hand-eye coordination, and concentration. This increases your ability to concentrate on one task at a time ‚Äî a skill that benefits your work and life.

Coloring also builds perseverance. Completing a detailed page is satisfying because it means consistent effort and concentration. Every stroke matters, demonstrating to you the value of small, consistent movements ‚Äî a mindset that builds achievement in anything you do.

**8. Enhance Your Emotional Well-being**

Emotions get bottled up due to busy lifestyles or a lack of proper outlets. Coloring can channel such emotions always safely and more creatively.

Choosing colors that match your mood allows the expression of emotions without words. For example:

* Bright colors like yellow and orange can always lift the mood.
* Blue and green colors promote calm.
* Meditative or creative colors like purple or burgundy convey thoughtfulness or creativity.

Over a period, coloring can become a calming self-therapy ‚Äî helping you release tension, process emotion, and feel more grounded.

**9. A Perfect Activity for All Ages**

Everyone enjoys coloring books. Children, teenagers, adults, and seniors love them. That makes them perfect for family gatherings or individual stress relief.

Parents can color with their children, creating memories that will last a lifetime while teaching creativity and focus. Seniors can use coloring to keep dexterity up and mental acuity sharp. Adults can use it as a meditation exercise, stress-reliever, and creative outlet.

No matter how old you are, a coloring book fits into your lifestyle. You can carry it to the park, to the office, or even on holiday ‚Äî an independent haven that you can tap into at will.

**10. Inexpensive, Convenient, and Limitless Choice**

Compared to other hobbies that require specialized materials or classes, coloring books are inexpensive. You need only a book and some coloring tools ‚Äî colored pencils, markers, or crayons.

**You can find new coloring books on almost any theme:**

* Nature and Flowers
* Animals and Wildlife
* Fantasy and Magic Worlds
* Inspirational Quotes
* Mandalas and Patterns
* Holiday and Seasonal Themes
* Whimsical Towns and Cozy Homes

There's something for every mood and personality. And when you're all finished with one book, you can step out and purchase another and enter new worlds of art.

**11. Coloring Builds Community and Connection**

Coloring is not a solo activity; it can also bring people together. Both online and offline, coloring clubs and groups are abundant, creating a sense of belonging and community.

You can join coloring challenges, post coloring tips, or even donate your completed works as presents for dear ones. It's a tidy, warm community where every member encourages creativity rather than competition.

Possessing a coloring book could be the ticket to becoming a member of an active, energetic community with shared interests.

**12. Coloring as Art Tharapy**

Art tharapy is a practice that uses art processes to enhance mental health. While simple, coloring is one of its most accessible forms.

Therapists recommend coloring, as a rule, to people with stress, trauma, or burnout. The steady rhythmic motion of coloring is soothing ‚Äî much like walking or knitting. It gives a sense of mastery and security, especially for people with anxiety or emotional overload.

Purchasing a coloring book can be your own kit of self-therapy ‚Äî a peaceful way of relaxing after stressful days or emotional combat.

**13. A Beautiful Way to Decorate or Gift**

When you finish a page, you are left with a tiny piece of art. You can frame your colored pages, use them to create new, creative greeting cards, or gift them to your closest friends.

Coloring books always make excellent gifts, for birthdays, holidays, or as a ""just because"" gift; they show thought and consideration. They're always suitable for everyone and every occasion, tangibly promoting more wellness and creativity.

**14. Coloring for Productivity and Focus**

Interestingly, coloring can also make you more productive. Many people use it as a short mental break during work or study sessions. Taking 5‚Äì10 minutes to color can refresh your brain, reduce decision fatigue, and improve concentration.

It's similar to meditation breaks or deep-breathing exercises ‚Äî but more fun! If you often feel mentally cluttered, keeping a coloring book near your workspace can help you reset and refocus.

**15. Your Legacy of Creativity**

Purchasing a coloring book isn't about personal joy ‚Äî it's about leaving a small legacy of creativity on the world. Each completed page is added to your story, a colored chronicle of your mood, thoughts, and creativity at a given time.

Years later, flipping through your colored pages will bring you back to periods of serenity, inspiration, and emotional maturity. It is a simple way to keep memories alive through art.

**Conclusion: A Simple Book That Changes Lives**

Coloring books may seem simple, but what they can do is fantastic. They cause you to slow down, breathe, and come back to yourself in a world that constantly demands more. They create joy, peace, imagination, and presence ‚Äî all for the price of a cup of coffee.

If you're stressed, in need of a hobby, or want a little calm in your day, a coloring book is where to start. It's more than something you do for art's sake; it's a therapy, an expression, and a meditative activity all in one.

So yeah ‚Äî you should most definitely purchase a coloring book sometime during your lifetime.

Because when you do, you're not simply buying a book ‚Äî you're investing in your happiness, your healing, and your imagination.

Grab those pencils, open your front page, and color your way to serenity ‚Äî one gorgeous stroke at a time.

This is what was on the file ‚¨áÔ∏è:

It started about three months ago, the dreams.
Not nightmares, not at first.
When I closed my eyes, I woke up in another life, a small, old apartment with creaky floors and a constant hum of traffic outside. The curtains were yellowed, and the air always smelled faintly of dust and rain.
I lived as someone else.
I worked at a coffee shop. I had friends that I recognized, but didn‚Äôt know. I even had a scar on my arm that didn‚Äôt exist when I woke up.
The strange part wasn‚Äôt the realism, it was the continuity.
Every night, I picked up right where I‚Äôd left off; The same world, the same people, even days passing by. I started keeping track.  I began writing down details, places, names, all of which matched each other, night after night.
It wasn‚Äôt a dream. It was another life.
At first, it was almost comforting. I preferred that world. The colors felt softer there. My other self,  I‚Äôll call her Victoria, was calmer, even happier.
One night, I felt her hesitate.
She was washing dishes, staring out the window at a dark street, when she whispered,
‚ÄúI dream about you too.‚Äù

I remember freezing because in that instant, it wasn‚Äôt me thinking it, it was her.
From then on, it got worse.
She started leaving notes for me, scrawled in her world‚Äôs handwriting, appearing on my nightstand when I woke up.
They said things like:
‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt both exist.‚Äù 
‚ÄúIf I wake up as you, you‚Äôll disappear.‚Äù

I stopped sleeping. I tried staying awake for days, but exhaustion always won.
Every time I drifted off, she seemed closer. Her world is darker. 
My reflection there lingered too long, as if testing the boundaries between us.
Then one night, I woke up and the air smelled like dust and rain.
The floorboards creaked. 
The curtains were yellowed.
I was Victoria.
I panicked. I tried everything, pinching, running outside, screaming. No one noticed anything strange. It wasn‚Äôt a dream anymore. I had switched.
I searched desperately for a way back.
I tried sleep, meditation, inflicted pain onto myself. 
Nothing worked.
Until one night, I felt exhaustion pull at me again, and I thought, maybe I‚Äôll wake up in my home.
When I opened my eyes, I was lying in my own bed again. Relief washed through me. My room. My world. My handwriting on the notes.
Only‚Ä¶ the handwriting was slightly different.
A little neater.
And when I walked to the mirror, the reflection smiled first, and said:
‚ÄúI told you, only one of us gets to wake up.‚Äù

I asked him and he confirmed they would go on breaks together smoke and get a coffee then go back to work but nothing more. Found out they would text each other when to go on breaks he would delete the messages before he got home and had her number saved just under the number no name so I wouldn't suspect. I forgave him since I had no proof of actual cheating? (Felt very dumb) Now fast forward October I found out they were still doing the same thing after I had told him to stop out of respect. I understand they work together so I had said it's find if a simple hello is said but he kept lying about it. They ended up getting scheduled breaks so they wouldn't meet up and I found out he would either take his break earlier or she would take hers later so they can have breaks together.

1o2qq04,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_RealisticMacaron6526/comments/1o2qq04/i_26f_ended_things_with_my_boyfriend_30m_but_i/,I (26F) ended things with my boyfriend (30M) but I can‚Äôt tell if I made the right decision or gave up too soon,"We were together a little over a year. Overall, it was a calm and affectionate relationship‚Äî easy to talk to, normal arguments that didn‚Äôt over escalate, no cheating, just the usual disagreements. He‚Äôs a good man in many ways: loyal, caring, the type who would show love through gestures more than words. He often brought me coffee at work or checked in with small things, and we‚Äôd go out at least once a week for dinner or something fun. My work schedule is complicated I work all the time and he has more free time from work or more flexibility. I‚Äôd contribute with groceries, coffee/dessert, occasional take-out, or little personal touches like handwritten letters or home-cooked meals. It felt balanced‚Äînot 50/50 financially, but fair.

Things started shifting over the past couple of months. He became emotionally guarded and, honestly, a bit cheap. He earns comfortably more than I do, but suddenly started saying he was spending too much and preferred staying in. When I offered to cover an outing, he‚Äôd refuse‚Äîbut then go golfing or out with friends within days. (He golfs about 3-4 times a week). And started hiding golfing from me. I noticed because when I‚Äôd see him he‚Äôd smell obviously from being out in the sun and he‚Äôd thought I wouldn‚Äôt notice. It‚Äôs a white little lie but all accumulated it made me feel a certain way. He would tell me his plans early morning before I left for work and while I was brushing my teeth or something. Like avoiding conversation or engagement. I let
Him know once that I don‚Äôt like when he tells me things last minute it Makes me feels unconsidered like he wouldn‚Äôt care of my thoughts on his plans. Like He also left to Europe for his bday with his friends (male & female) and never invited me he‚Äôd just say ‚ÄúI wish I could‚Äôve taken you with me‚Äù. If it‚Äôs your birthday you definitely want to consider your partner for a milestone in your life wouldn‚Äôt you? He came back expecting me to plan something big for him when I already felt a certain way I wasn‚Äôt even asked once. It wasn‚Äôt about money itself; it was the mixed signals that made me feel like I wasn‚Äôt a priority.

He would be acting different socially at times. Around his best friend he was very warm and attentive I felt very cool and comfy, but around another group he seemed a bit more cold idk if embarrassed to show affection, giving them more attention than me. We went to a trivia night once and he didn‚Äôt even interact with me to know if I was okay or comfortable. Once we left I told him it made me feel left out and disconnected and felt anxious. He apologized and promised to do better, but the next time he invited me, I declined out of anxiety, and he went anyway. He frequently invited me with them but never fully showed me he would be different around them. 

I kept trying to communicate my feelings calmly. I never expected constant texting, just some consistency or the occasional call or FaceTime since we didn‚Äôt always see each other often. Instead, he‚Äôd text midday, rarely initiate calls, and when he traveled for his birthday he went to the other extreme‚Äîsending dozens of ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù texts that felt performative. When I brought up that emotional balance, he said he didn‚Äôt know what else I wanted and insisted he was already trying his best. I‚Äôm not that clingy I‚Äôm usually independent, I work a lot I have my hobbies and I workout a lot. He usually the same he works maybe not as much as me but works, golfs, works out and occasionally goes out more than I do. 

One of our last conversations was after I said I couldn‚Äôt see him one evening because I had errands and the gym. He demanded to know exactly what I was doing and accused me of not planning things or initiating or reciprocating effort. That was when I realized we were in a blame loop instead of working together. I told him by text that I was done‚Äîit just didn‚Äôt feel like a partnership anymore. I didn‚Äôt want to argue all I expressed was that I needed consistency in effort and communication and he insisted he‚Äôd been doing it well. Instead of talking things through and hearing each other out to improve for both. 

The next day he dropped off flowers, coffee and a snack but didn‚Äôt say his intentions or why just froze little back and forth of how his day went and he left. I thought he‚Äôd send me a text to express himself but nothing, I later texted within a few hours and thanked him for the beautiful flowers. Last time he gave me flowers was two months ago. And he hadn‚Äôt dropped coffee or anything even though the commute to drive is about 15min. When we met to exchange belongings, he said he loved me but left the decision entirely up to me‚Äîno attempt to talk it through or ask what went wrong. All this time he was a bit defensive and tried to justify himself and mainly justify that he was right. He even gave me back the small love letters and details I‚Äôd made him and given to throughout the relationship which was harsh. 

I know I have flaws too. I can be emotional and anxious and maybe I expect a bit more reassurance than most, but I genuinely tried to make things work. He‚Äôs a kind, loyal person, but very emotionally reserved. I‚Äôm a big yapper and can express my emotions but I constantly have to try and be more open and patient so he can feel comfortable expressing himself instead of keeping it to himself. 
Know how he‚Äôs feeling or reading the room and noticing he‚Äôs anxious or stressed and having to approach and ask. I feel stressed mainly from work and I would spiral at times. He would just say things like ‚Äúyou work hard‚Äù and make me a bubble bath. Gotta give it to him though with the bubble baths it was out little moments to de stress. Anyway, I just kept feeling like I was doing the emotional labor‚Äîtrying to connect while he stayed behind a wall.

So now I‚Äôm torn. Did I do the right thing by ending it? Or was it something we could have fixed if we‚Äôd both put in the effort differently? Has anyone been in this situation with someone who struggles emotionally or with vulnerability?

1o2qm65,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o2qm65,Tired of getting terrible dating advice from friends? I created 10 super prompts that turn ChatGPT into the ultimate dating coach.,"**TL;DR: Modern dating is hard. Generic advice sucks. I created 10 ""super prompts"" that transform a generic AI (like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) into a specialized, expert-level dating coach. These prompts cover everything: building a magnetic profile, mastering conversation, building real confidence, handling rejection, and planning great dates. This guide gives you the exact prompts and the strategy to use them effectively.**

# How I Turned AI Into the Ultimate Dating Coach (And How You Can, Too)

Let‚Äôs be honest: dating in 2025 can feel like a full-time job with a terrible boss. The ghosting, the awkward small talk, the profile anxiety‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs exhausting. We read articles and watch videos, but the advice is always so generic. ""Be confident!"" they say. Thanks, I'm cured.  And it's been a long time since we had Will Smith and Kevin James in the movie Hitch!

I got fed up. I realized the problem wasn't just me - it was the quality / algorithms of the apps and advice I was using. So, I started experimenting. What if, instead of asking an AI generic questions, I could *program* it to act as an elite dating expert?

After a ton of refinement, I landed on a system that works.

A super prompt doesn't just ask a question. It gives the AI a **Persona**, a **Context**, and a specific, detailed **Task**. This forces it to move beyond generic fluff and provide actionable, personalized, and genuinely insightful coaching.

This isn't about getting AI to write cheesy pickup lines. This is about using it as a tool to build your own skills, understand social dynamics, and show up as your most authentic, confident self.

Here are the 10 super prompts that will change your dating life.

# Strategy & Pro Tips: How to Make This Work for YOU

Just copying the prompts is level one. Here's how to get to level 100:

1. **Specificity is Your Superpower:** The `[You Provide]` sections are the magic ingredient. The more honest, detailed, and specific you are, the more personalized and powerful the AI's response will be. Don't be generic.
2. **Iterate, Iterate, Iterate:** The first output is a draft, not a final command. Use follow-up commands like:
   * ""Make that bio funnier and more concise.""
   * ""Give me 3 more date ideas, but for a rainy day.""
   * ""Rewrite that script in a more playful tone.""
3. **Use It as a Mirror:** The AI's output is based on what you give it. If you don't like its suggestions, ask yourself why. Does the ""witty"" bio not feel like you? Great! Tell the AI, ""That's not quite my voice. Let's try something warmer and more sincere."" This process helps you understand yourself better.
4. **Remember the Human Element:** The AI is your coach, not your replacement. It gives you the strategy and the script, but **YOU** have to deliver it with authenticity. The goal is to internalize these skills so you don't need the scripts anymore. This is a training tool to build *your* confidence and *your* communication skills.

This system has honestly made dating more fun, less stressful, and way more successful for me. It's about taking back control and being intentional.

Next I will release a set of prompts on relationships and communication.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Calgary Flames vs. Vancouver Canucks: A Tale of Two Sieves (One Leaks Less)**  
*By Your Humorously Analytical Sports Oracle*

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a hockey clash that‚Äôs about as thrilling as a tax audit but with more slapshots. The Calgary Flames (-170 underdogs, really? *sigh*) travel to Rogers Arena to face the Vancouver Canucks (-210 favorites, basically the NBA‚Äôs Luka Donƒçiƒá in terms of being a sure thing). Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a Zamboni and the wit of a tired Linesman after a 10-hour shift.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Math, Not Magic

First, let‚Äôs decode the numbers. Vancouver‚Äôs -210 moneyline implies they‚Äôre expected to win \~68% of the time. Calgary‚Äôs +170 suggests a 37% chance, which, in betting terms, is about as likely as a vegan surviving a bear attack. The total goals are set at 5.5, with the **Under** favored (-120) thanks to Vancouver‚Äôs recent home dominance: 15 of 19 games under 5.5 goals. The Canucks are basically the NBA‚Äôs Boston Celtics in the 4th quarter‚Äî*boring but efficient*.

1o2ql83,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o2ql83,[Question] Is this much grit just unavoidable? (more context in description),"I have been reading about why Espresso shots can sometimes have grit and most of the reasons are due to unclean grinder or old or faulty equipment.

Most of my equipment is very new and I am pretty sure it‚Äôs not faulty. And let‚Äôs be real- not everyone cleans their grinder other than maybe once in a blue moon.

Many of us enjoy trying new coffee or new roasts and even the same roasts across different batches will be slightly different so your grinder will *always* have some leftover grounds from a previous roast or batch due to non-zero retention, even in the costliest of grinders, which will introduce minor inconsistency in your grind size and quality hence potentially resulting in a little bit of grit among other things like non-ideal flavour.

Thinking out loud: considering the average John Doe, who doesn‚Äôt clean his grinder before every single shot like Doe Maniac would, wanting a cup of decent Joe, is it really *this hard* to avoid grit? Thoughts?",0,1760067902.0,IndiaCoffee,2,0.5,False

By Preston Dennett

All UFO encounters are interesting, but perhaps the most fascinating is when UFOs land and humanoids come out! Here are ten cases of UFO landings from across the world including the United States, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Spain, Norway, Finland, Scotland, France and England. They span over a period of five decades. They involve a wide variety of humanoid figures. Many are multiple witness cases. Almost all of them involve some form hard evidence such as landing traces, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances, psychic effects and physiological reactions. Some include government involvement and even disturbing threats from apparent men in black.

JUL 23, 1947, PITANGA BRAZIL: Topographer Jose C. Higgins hears a high-pitched hum. Suddenly a metallic craft lands next to him and out come three beautiful ETs wearing weird spacesuits. Jose founds himself surrounded by them. To his relief, they appear to be friendly. Feeling fear, he retreats and watches them from a distance as they begin playing like small children.

AUG 1960, NEWCASTLE, NSW AUSTRALIA: Helen Aldridge is awakened by a buzzing noise coming from outside her home. Looking out the window, she sees a craft shaped like a toy top landing in her backyard. Out steps a humanoid dressed in an olive-green jumpsuit. To her shock, it climbs over her fence and approaches right up to her window.

JUL 31, 1966, PRESQUE ISLE STATE PARK, PA: When their car gets stuck in the sand, Gerald LaBelle goes for help, leaving behind Betty Klem, Doug Tibbets, Anita Haifley and her two children. Without warning, a UFO lands in the forest next to them. Police arrive and leave with Doug to investigate. At this point, a huge hairy humanoid emerges from the forest and attacks the car. Before long officers from Project Blue Book arrive to investigate.

AUG 29, 1967, CUSSAC, FRANCE: When 13-year-old Francois Delpeuch and his little sister Ann-Marie (age 9) go to retrieve the family cows, they come upon a huge glowing sphere and four small humanoids walking around beneath it. When they approach for a closer look, the strange beings notice the two children and begin floating one by one back into the craft.

FEB 5, 1971, KINNULA, FINLAND: Two forestry workers (Peter Aliranta and Esko Sneck) get the shock of their lives when a UFO lands next to them in the forest. A small 4-foot-tall being emerges and approaches Peter. When the being turns around to enter the craft, Peter rushes forward and grabs the ET by the foot. It‚Äôs a decision that he will regret for a long time.

NOV 14, 1976, WINCHESTER, ENGLAND: Joyce Bowles is driving home. Her friend Edwin Pratt is in the passenger seat. They are concerned to see a UFO dropping down from the sky ahead of them on the road. Suddenly their car steers itself off the road. When they finally get it to stop, they see a UFO blocking the roadway and humanoids looking out the windows at them. Then one emerges from the craft, walks right up to them and stares at them fixedly. Their strange adventure has only begun.

MAY 18, 1977, ELGIN, SCOTLAND: Karen McLennan and Fiona Morrison (both 10-years-old) are playing near their homes when they hear a soft humming noise in the woods. They go to investigate and come upon a landed craft. Standing next to it is a tall slender man dressed in a silvery jumpsuit. As the man walks towards them, the girls flee. When they turn around, they see the craft flying off. But when they get home, they learn there are more witnesses. And then the threats start coming in.

SEP 18, 1978, SAN GIORGIO DI NOGARO, ITALY: Railway employee Giorgio Filiputti only wants to enjoy a quiet day of fishing. But it‚Äôs not to be. He hears a strange noise and an odd breeze. Going to investigate, he comes upon a landed craft. A weird 4-foot-tall humanoid looks surprised to see Giorgio approach. He stares at Giorgio and begins to work on apparently repairing his craft.

NOV 24, 1978, GERENA, SPAIN: When four young men go hunting along the Guadiamar River, they get a lot more than they bargained for. Seeing strange lights in the forest, they come upon a landed UFO and a 7-foot-tall humanoid. The strange figure starts walking towards them. When it gets too close, the men run away in a panic. Later, strange land-traces are found.

JUL 25, 1981. STJORDAL, NORWAY: Hjordis Hokstad wants only to enjoy her morning coffee and watch the wild deer in the field behind her house. Instead she sees a landed UFO and a weird humanoid wearing a spacesuit walking around the craft. She grabs her binoculars and gets a nice close look. Little does she know, her neighbor is watching the whole thing from his house.

There is no more room for denial. The evidence for the reality of UFOs and extraterrestrials is here for those with the courage to examine it. We are not alone! We are only one of many different humanoids in a universe teeming with intelligent life.

Turned 29 two months ago, 10 months shy of the dreaded age now. 

I am a govt employee, a very well respected profession which pays fairly okay, but I just feel so stuck sometimes. I have been in this profession for 6 years now. (And I cannot quit, its a bond)

I live a life of isolation, no friends, only colleagues. Going home is a very far fetched dream because I dont get many offs, even sundays are working. 

I have an interest in studying and learning new things but I strongly feel that my potential is being wasted away in this profession of mine. 
You just listen to what has been done and then you do it, no reasons, no logics, just doing what has to be done, textbook work. 
There is no time to follow hobbies, there is no time to follow fitness, you are forced to attend official parties, forced to drink sometimes. I used to sing and play the guitar but the music in me has just died because there is no drive anymore, owing to all the work pressure. 

I never had anger issues but I am so irritable lately, because I am surrounded by people of low calibre who take things so lightly. I have been putting on weight and hairfall is imminent too. 
The idea of marriage also seems so worrisome because of my profession, since it will mostly be a long distance marriage. 


Sometimes, during some cold, quiet evenings, I take a sip of my coffee and wonder that is this how life will always be? Did I fuck it up, royally?",3,1760067646.0,MidTwentiesIndia,7,1.0,False

I first went to evil twin with u/mirin_g (see last pic), went there cuz it‚Äôs close to salut pies‚Ä¶and it also comes in a jar so I can take it to work) I got the oat milk matcha jar and a iced strawberry matcha. The strawberry tasted so artificial I cringed, u/mirin_g had a sip too and I think he got no comment. We just stirred it hard so the strawberry flavour eventually disappeared. The jar I had it before, it‚Äôs fine, matcha could be a lot stronger. 

Then the next day I went to WEST TWO ESPRESSO, it‚Äôs near my accom, and u/mirin_g said it‚Äôs good so let‚Äôs go. I got a strawberry matcha and a mango matcha (asked for the mango one in a takeaway cup and no ice so I can have it later), both were delicious the mango/strawberry flavours were there, you can really taste them and not superficial. Then the next day I tried banana bread matcha (got cinnamon on top) and a lavender one, you can really taste the banana bread lolll and it wasn‚Äôt weird to drink that with matcha surprisingly (I had my doubts but was pleasantly surprised).

1o2pzft,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o2pzft,I Finished with a Bang!,"One year, averaging 10k/steps a day each week, outside, no matter the weather, with my doggo. 

I‚Äôve been riddled with injuries. I had about 5 years in my 30s that I just couldn‚Äôt keep it going. Bike wrecks, foot breaks, achilles and hip problems. You name it. In 2018 my one health goal was no injuries. I was very careful. No box jumps, no crazy squats etc. I made it. In 2021 I did 75 Hard, Phase 1 and Phase 2. It changed me. I took up walking as my second workout and just did it outside and I loved it. I bought a Ruck. And got up to 45 lbs on my back and did a half marathon. Feeling good. Through it all I had nagging foot problems. No Plantars but achilles, tendon and metatarsal problems. I started swimming more and lifting less and kept walking. It got better. And I did have to get a Cortisone shot and a lot of Physical Therapy. But a year ago I decided I‚Äôm going to focus on lifting and walking (but in reality I couldn‚Äôt give up swimming). I made a commitment to myself and my dog that we were walking 10k steps a day outside no matter what. Through the year I‚Äôve learned SO much. And it‚Äôs shifted so much in my life. Time to think and not consume media. I listen to music or a book sometimes but I‚Äôm listening to less and less music with words and more and more meditative music. I feel like I‚Äôm inundated with media all of the time and I‚Äôm trying to cut out podcasts and tv. More books and music. 

Watching the seasons change has been such a celebration. The first morning I had to put on a sweater. The first morning I could walk without my shirt on. The wind, the bugs, the outdoor poops and pees. The rain and thunder. One morning we had a massive lightning storm for half an hour I just watched on my walk. Most of all I LOVE going out in the dark. I like starting before sunrise with a red light headlamp so I‚Äôm essentially walking in the dark. And then I get to my turn around 30 min before sunrise and when I turn back to head home I just watched the sun come up. It‚Äôs lovely. 

I‚Äôve had to learn how to dress for the weather. I have a uniform I set out the night before. Based on 10 degree increments. I have what I wear for 85+,70-80, 60-70 etc. It took a minute. I was an outdoor gear junkie in my past but I‚Äôm using a lot more well made, quality pieces that are better suited and warmer. But you have to learn. A Frogg Togg Poncho is the only rec I have for rain. Wear whatever you‚Äôd normally wear, then slip it over. I have a very expensive rain jacket but I love the Poncho bc it breathes better and covers my legs. Cinch the hood down over a flat ill baseball cap and it‚Äôs perfect. 

I‚Äôve learned I really like a little trail picnic on my long walks. I buy a canned iced coffee and will take some bacon and a sweet treat and maybe a snack for my dog and do an out and back and stop by the river and sit and listen to the waterfall and let my dog get water. 

And I‚Äôve learned that for me, it‚Äôs not 10k/day everyday. It‚Äôs a minimum of 1 mile outside, which puts me at 7-8k a day. And then one good long effort each week. Usually 8 miles weighted on a Saturday. But 3 miles in the morning at 5am is what my typical route is.  

I prefer doing an out and back bc I want to know when I‚Äôm halfway done. I like knowing that and stopping for a break if I feel the need.I might sit down for 5 minutes and take off my vest but it does help. But not more than 10 minutes. 

My dailys I don‚Äôt bring anything. My long walks (8 miles, 20 min pace) are weighted. I had a GoRuck with a weight plate but this year bought a 5.11 weighted tactical vest and it‚Äôs way better. With all of my gear it weighs around 22 lbs. I carry two water bottles, a center pocket with a pistol, pepper spray, flashlight, toilet paper, a bandana doused in off in a plastic sandwich bag for bugs, a headlamp, ear buds, a tiny tripod and my phone and keys. It also has a tiny first aid kit on the back. And I put bright hi-vis patches on it. I don‚Äôt like scaring people in the dark. We have some bums down by the river where I walk. 

This year I did 12 weeks of carnivore and it all clicked, the walking, the lifting, the long effort days. I started doing yoga at night instead of sitting on the couch. Then I quit watching tv and just play records and as the year went on there‚Äôs been some high highs and some low lows but I‚Äôve had time to think about them and plan and consider more. I‚Äôm less reactionary. I have better control of my emotions. Part of it is the physical benefits but the mental ones have been noticeable. But I‚Äôm very intentional with that time. 

My las three days of my year my brother invited me to Montana to bird hunt. On day 363 I walked up an enormous hill in central Montana in beautiful ankle high grass, no weeds, hunting with dogs and exploring old abandoned homesteads. 20k steps. On day 364 I got to walk 16k steps in between two huge Buttes in a beautiful valley. I felt like a Rider of Rohan straight out of Lord of the Rings. And on day 365 I walked 20k steps with a lot of elevation on a Hutterite Sheep Farm. We saw wild horses and wild dogs and old cairns. Totally unreal. 

I just felt grateful. Walking 10k steps/day outside for an entire year, committing to myself regardless of how I feel or any circumstances I‚Äôm doing this for me. For my health. It is critically important and if I miss it, I notice.

And as a 42 yo that could‚Äôve taken better care of himself, I didn‚Äôt get injured. Walking is something that gets me activity, but I don‚Äôt have to constantly be resting from. I‚Äôve found I have to move every day. When I try and do 2-3 days a week it never works out. I have to do Monday-Friday same thing, same place or it‚Äôll be missed eventually. I can wake up and get active everyday at the same time to be consistent but I don‚Äôt have to move as hard each day. I had to learn what was too much and what was not enough. Daily work teaches you how to do that. Learn to listen to your body. Walking is it for me. 

If you made it to here, hmu if you ever have questions. This is my testimony of walking. I‚Äôm a lifer. ",2,1760066065.0,walking,2,0.6,False
1o2pz4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/FATTravel/comments/1o2pz4f/booking_extra_nights_pre_and_post_for_early/,Booking extra nights pre and post for early arrival or late departure.,"Wondering if you guys are booking extra nights when flights don't align, particularly with young kids. 

So for instance, flight leaves at 8.30pm, pick up at hotel say 4pm or whatever (1.5 hour drive). What are the options from 11am to 4pm?

Recently, we got comp extension to 1230, and then just wondered around for 3 hours, had lunch, then coffee, so it's certainly a rich person's problem and do-able but feels like passing time.

The big issue seems to be arrival, like 7am touchdown, arrive at say 9, have 5 hours before check-in. Last time we were given a hospitality room which was kind of a windowless broom closet and still painful after long haul overnight and nearly 27 hours in transit. I did email twice and both times they said maybe but I knew it was a no and either way we need to plan assuming no under that scenario.

 For some of my cheaper resort stays like Shangri la in SQ and Penang, we just started paying for the extra nights ($800 and $400 respectively). We have status with them so do get an extra hour two but it's based on availability so again the assumption with an infant and toddler is unavailable. 

To add, we have a $3000 night stay coming up for ten  nights and they gave us the early check-in, but that seems non standard and due to off peak. 

I feel above $1000 gets pricey for me psychologically in terms of paying a night for a few hours, which is stupid as my current trip was 40k just in flights.

It's been 7 months+

No coffee or pre workout or caffeine at all.

Sleep is good and anxiety gone (the reasons I quit).

Gym is less fun ( I compete high level sport). Work is hard, the days are boring haha.

I miss it, not craving it, but I miss it.

Considering making it to the 12 month mark, so I can say I did it.

When I start using again, I'm going to allow only one coffee a day, and never two days in a row.

I think I will stick clear of energy drinks, but once a week I'd love to have some pre workout before training on days like today when i am so tired and won't be training til 7pm.

I've recently started Drinking Guinness on the weekend and it is the first drink or thing I've found that makes me as happy as coffee did.

Other alternative, I quit my jobs and play guitar all day while walking the dog and training. Then I think I'd be ok not needing coffee.

EDIT\*\* Forgot to mention, I believe the negative side effects I was seeing with coffee was due to overconsumption while I was dieting for a competition.

Very ironic lang isipin na the rally was supposed to fight against stolen funds tapos nanakawan pa ako. I won't spare the details as I've already done all the security measures (remotely locked my phone, updated all passwords, bank records, sim card replacement, cloud backups, filed a police report, submitted an IMEI blocking to NTC, etc) after my phone was stolen. I am one of the 10+ people who reported a stolen phone in Manila Ermita Police Station 5.

The police in station 5 even accompanied me to one of the pinged locations to hopefully catch the thief, but we were unsuccessful. I know that the chances of retrieving a stolen phone is very slim, but I had hope.

Pabalik balik ng Victory Mall yung thief and I was able to track my phone every day, until the final location is in Greenhills last week. As much as gusto ko puntahan to confront the thief, I wouldn't want to endanger myself kasi baka magkakasabwat yang mga yan. Di siguro mabuksan so they gave up and probably chopped my parts into pieces nalang.

Nakakasama lang ng loob kasi this is the first phone I bought with my money. And I paid this in full at launch. I never dropped my phone and this never had any physical damages and not even a scratch. Tapos mananakawan lang ako sa isang rally against stolen funds and corruption.

I have no one else to blame but myself. Maybe I was careless with my phone that day. Maybe I should have stayed at home and protested in spirit. Pero I've learned that pickpockets can happen to anyone, anytime,  anywhere.

1o2pmpc,https://www.reddit.com/r/azuredevops/comments/1o2pmpc/kubevpn_revolutionizing_kubernetes_local/,KubeVPN: Revolutionizing Kubernetes Local Development,"## Why KubeVPN?

In the Kubernetes era, developers face a critical conflict between **cloud-native complexity** and **local development
agility**. Traditional workflows force developers to:

1. Suffer frequent `kubectl port-forward`/`exec` operations
2. Set up mini Kubernetes clusters locally (e.g., minikube)
3. Risk disrupting shared dev environments

KubeVPN solves this through **cloud-native network tunneling**, seamlessly extending Kubernetes cluster networks to
local machines with three breakthroughs:

- üöÄ **Zero-Code Integration**: Access cluster services without code changes
- üíª **Real-Environment Debugging**: Debug cloud services in local IDEs
- üîÑ **Bidirectional Traffic Control**: Route specific traffic to local or cloud

![KubeVPN Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubenetworks/kubevpn/master/samples/flat_log.png)

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Direct Cluster Networking

```bash
kubevpn connect
```

Instantly gain:

- ‚úÖ Service name access (e.g., `productpage.default.svc`)
- ‚úÖ Pod IP connectivity
- ‚úÖ Native Kubernetes DNS resolution

```shell
‚ûú curl productpage:9080 # Direct cluster access
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>...</html>
```

### 2. Smart Traffic Interception

Precision routing via header conditions:

```bash
kubevpn proxy deployment/productpage --headers user=dev-team
```

- Requests with `user=dev-team` ‚Üí Local service
- Others ‚Üí Original cluster handling

### 3. Multi-Cluster Mastery

Connect two clusters simultaneously:

```bash
kubevpn connect -n dev --kubeconfig ~/.kube/cluster1  # Primary
kubevpn connect -n prod --kubeconfig ~/.kube/cluster2 --lite # Secondary
```

### 4. Local Containerized Dev

Clone cloud pods to local Docker:

```bash
kubevpn dev deployment/authors --entrypoint sh
```

Launched containers feature:

- üåê Identical network namespace
- üìÅ Exact volume mounts
- ‚öôÔ∏è Matching environment variables

## Technical Deep Dive

KubeVPN's three-layer architecture:

| Component           | Function                     | Core Tech                  |
|---------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Traffic Manager** | Cluster-side interception    | MutatingWebhook + iptables |
| **VPN Tunnel**      | Secure local-cluster channel | tun device + WireGuard     |
| **Control Plane**   | Config/state sync            | gRPC streaming + CRDs      |


## Performance Benchmark

100QPS load test results:

| Scenario      | Latency | CPU Usage | Memory |
|---------------|---------|-----------|--------|
| Direct Access | 28ms    | 12%       | 256MB  |
| KubeVPN Proxy | 33ms    | 15%       | 300MB  |
| Telepresence  | 41ms    | 22%       | 420MB  |

KubeVPN outperforms alternatives in overhead control.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# macOS/Linux
brew install kubevpn

# Windows
scoop install kubevpn

# Via Krew
kubectl krew install kubevpn/kubevpn
```

### Sample Workflow

1. **Connect Cluster**

```bash
kubevpn connect --namespace dev
```

2. **Develop & Debug**

```bash
# Start local service
./my-service &

# Intercept debug traffic

I saw the Good Earth Coffeehouse near the 6th Ave LRT station and figured I‚Äôd grab another coffee while using their washroom. Before ordering, I politely asked the barista if I could use the restroom (it was literally right beside her). She said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not public ‚Äî you‚Äôll have to ask security across the hallway for the code.‚Äù

So I hurry to the security desk, barely holding it together, and the guard says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not for public use.‚Äù I explained I wasn‚Äôt loitering ‚Äî just a working guy with a genuine emergency. After repeating myself, visibly fed up, he finally took pity on me, walked me to a washroom, and unlocked it.

I get that there are issues downtown ‚Äî people misusing washrooms, safety concerns, etc. But come on‚Ä¶ it was 8 AM, I was dressed formally, and it was a coffee shop. If this is what someone in my situation has to go through, imagine how much worse it could be for others ‚Äî especially women, seniors, or anyone with medical conditions.

Where can I even raise this as a civic concern? Shouldn‚Äôt downtown Calgary have some accessible washrooms for the public?

I signed my 2 year old up for a part time school close to us off of a neighbors recommendation. She lives right next door, shes nice enough but shes the nosy type and knows everyones business.

At this school, they assign you buddies, someone to answer your questions or whatever if you need help. This buddy reached out to me to introduce herself and said we got paired together, maybe we could meet up for coffee etc. The day she had mentioned I said I couldnt and I said maybe next week but she said she wasnt sure and would get back to me. I missed her text when she did tell me, when she asked again we had contractors starting on our house and a lot going on so I asked for a raincheck. 

Honestly, I‚Äôm not planning on getting together with her. This school is very heavy on community and social events (I didnt know this until after we signed up) and its just not me, I always have things going on, we just finished house projects with people in and out, my son was sick last week and I‚Äôm sick now, and I‚Äôm also very newly pregnant and not feeling well. I was very nice over texts, I doubt this woman is dying to get together so I figured no big deal. 

Well now my nosy ass neighbor texted me that my buddy told her she ‚Äúreached out a couple times and didnt hear back‚Äù from me. 

I‚Äôm just fuming at this point. I dont understand why shes involving herself in this and why its her problem. I dont want to respond because I dont want to fuel her fire and make her think this is ok to do because it has nothing to do with her. But I will probably bump into her at some point and honestly dont even want to acknowledge her because it just really pisses me off. Shes such a nosy person, before school started she tried telling me I had to come to all these events and things and almost forcing me. Like if I want to go I‚Äôll go? We signed our son up for some socialization and fun and to learn, not for us to make friends and socialize idk.

I (27f) and my friend b (26f) have been friends since middle school she is essentially the same age is me but was born a few months later in the new year, but practically the same age. So we both lived in the same city our whole lives and I am the only one with a car. Since at the time we both lived close to each other i didn't really charge for gas money oe anything since we like to go to the same places plus we had buses so she never got a car. However, I recently moved a few years ago 2 hours away and the drive has been strenuous. I have talked to B before about it and she promised to help with gas money and such. We also had this conversation when I still lived in the city too but B didn't contribute as often then either. So one time she visited I taught her to drive and got B her license in 3 days while I was sick *not trying to brag though lol* but I did hope it would motivate B to want to get a car so she can visit me more. Also, I do get tired easy especially if I'm picking her up after a long day of work or something else and would hope she would at least offer to drive to or from her place, but it never happens. I also would hope since i spend about $60 to to pick B up and drop her off she would help but she only buys me a coffee on the way back to her place in addition to employee discount which contribute to less than $13 which sucks at times. I However, hope she would want to get a car and bring it up in conversation lightly but this still hasn't happened and B keeps telling me she is saving up but every time I see her B has new jewelry or anime stuff which is not cheap. B keeps telling me she broke or has bills to pay, so when we make plans we don't really do much. 
So my issue is that I can't keep driving to pick her up without contributing more or making an effort to come out to see me where I can pick her up closer. It's hurting my bank and my miles. I love B like a sister and she has been there for me for all my chaos and try to be there for her but she's more reserved. I have made new friends where I live and I had hoped B would have made new friends too in the 4 years we have been apart but hasn't really. It could be because B is more introverted and I'm both intro and extro. However, I want her to find reason to have a more open experience besides relying on me for a good time. Plus I can be a bit of a people pleaser which is why I still pick her up when we make plans. I have to plan an additional day off work just to pick her up before the day of our plans knowing the trip is about a total of 4 hours and just want to relax after that and can't keep putting myself though the strain especially since I have gone back to school while working full time I'm exhausted and wish she would help if she want to hang out. 
*So do I cut my loss for a long term friendship or try harder with her to make her help when B wants to visit. 
*note B is extremely nice person.*

She lives right next door, shes nice enough but shes the nosy type and knows everyones business.

At this school, they assign you buddies, someone to answer your questions or whatever if you need help. This buddy reached out to me to introduce herself and said we got paired together, maybe we could meet up for coffee etc. The day she had mentioned I said I couldnt and I said maybe next week but she said she wasnt sure and would get back to me. I missed her text when she did tell me, when she asked again we had contractors starting on our house and a lot going on so I asked for a raincheck. 

Honestly, I‚Äôm not planning on getting together with her. This school is very heavy on community and social events (I didnt know this until after we signed up) and its just not me, I always have things going on, we just finished house projects with people in and out, my son was sick last week and I‚Äôm sick now, and I‚Äôm also very newly pregnant and not feeling well. I was very nice over texts, I doubt this woman is dying to get together so I figured no big deal. 

Well now my nosy ass neighbor texted me that my buddy told her she ‚Äúreached out a couple times and didnt hear back‚Äù from me. 

I‚Äôm just fuming at this point. I dont understand why shes involving herself in this and why its her problem. I dont want to respond because I dont want to fuel her fire and make her think this is ok to do because it has nothing to do with her. But I will probably bump into her at some point and honestly dont even want to acknowledge her because it just really pisses me off. Shes such a nosy person, before school started she tried telling me I had to come to all these events and things and almost forcing me. Like if I want to go I‚Äôll go? We signed our son up for some socialization and fun and to learn, not for us to make friends and socialize idk.

I had promised another redditor I would write a synopsis of my campaign and while I am doing that I had fun and channeled my inner Hoid into the writting. I hope y'all like it!

  
Chapter 1. Intro time baby

¬†¬†¬†There‚Äôs nothing like getting together for a sleepover with friends. Even as adults, your Narrator reflects, the ability to push back sleep, as you can always catch up on that later, so you can spend more time engaging with friends, is like no other. That is how our fateful story begins, dear reader, as my four friends took off of work and planned a weekend full of games, laughter, and very little sleep.

¬†¬†¬†Friday goes well with everyone making it in mostly on time. First to walk in is Clover, with her long black hair and some nonsense attitude. She does love her silly conversations or dirty jokes. Clover always has a discerning look on her face as if she‚Äôs thinking five steps ahead of everyone. The first to tell you she can be very defensive, but conversely is a good listener (Haha) that truly wants to help. The kind of person whose notes have mental notes on how to take notes. Where was I? Oh right, she greets the narrator and his wife (for of course he is married to the most beautiful woman on both planets) as we were definitely not trying to madly finish cleaning the apartment.¬†

¬†¬†¬†How does so much dust accumulate? Thankfully, it‚Äôs just dead human particles that come off with a Swiffer and not needing a whole job to scrape it off as it falls from the sky. But I get ahead of myself.

¬†¬†¬†Speaking of getting ahead, the next friend to come in briefly says high before rushing ahead and heading directly to the bathroom. Toe (no that‚Äôs not his real name of course we all have different names) is the tallest and biggest of the lot. One of those types who you know your good friends if he bullies you every little chance he can get. A little rough around the edges but if he cares about you there is no going back. A true ride or die kind of friend. Unless of course duty calls as he flies by.¬†

¬†¬†¬†Third to walk in is Fate. They come in with their laid-back attitude reflected in the baseball cap they are wearing front forward on their freshly shaven head. I mean, who keeps it functional nowadays? I thought everyone still tried to act cool with it backwards and just squinted in the sun. Nonetheless, Fate has the smallest frame and an attitude to match. Which is to say none. Amongst friends, more of a go with the flow kind of person, much like your braggadocious narrator. Although force them to be in charge and they will bring out the managerial side that kept their coffee shop running despite the stupid coworkers and the stupider customers.¬†

¬†¬†¬†After the many separate bathroom breaks, as sadly the Narrator is balling on a budget and only has the one bathroom, we all get together in the living room to catch up and shoot the shit as we wait on the last friend to make it.¬†

¬†¬†¬†A little while later, we hear the knock, and I let my friend Merc in. The shortest of the friends, but don‚Äôt let that fool you. Her presence and volume speak, well volumes, your Narrator says with a shrug. She too, has long black hair, more curly than Clover‚Äôs. She apologizes for being late as she was held up at work, saving dog lives or something. With a joyful attitude and a straight kind of humor, she completes the group as we settled in for a night of fun.

¬†¬†¬†After calling it quits with the games and noting it is time for bed, we then stay up chatting for much longer than we anticipated (as always).

¬†¬†¬†We bid each other good night, for they have their air mattresses and sofa beds all set up. Your narrator settles in his bedroom with his wonderful wife, who went to bed at a much more reasonable time.

¬†¬†¬†Couldn‚Äôt have been a more great evening of fun. I can‚Äôt wait to get a whole day of it tomorrow your sorely mistaken Narrator thought as he drifted off to sleep.

¬†¬†

Chapter 2. The shower continues to run‚Ä¶

¬†¬†¬†The group of friends slowly wake up in the morning to hear the shower going with the door closed. Nothing out of the ordinary, the Narrator thinks they think. As their friend (Me the Narrator) does like to take short showers in the morning. They talk and work on the true test of getting up in the morning. Actually getting up.¬†

¬†¬†¬†The friends escape the clutches of the half sunken yet more comfortable air mattress as the shower continues to run.¬†

¬†¬†¬†They all gather their day-to-day items, and get ready for a day of relaxation and fun, as the shower continues to run.

¬†¬†¬†They begin to get suspicious as the shower continues to run. Toe is voluntold to go knock on the door to see if everything is alright. Yet, even after some loud knocks and a few hellos and everything okays, there is no answer.¬†

¬†¬†¬†Toe decides to turn the handle and slowly open the door, but before he even makes it a fraction of an inch a bright brilliant light engulfs the 4 friends. Their senses wash away from them as all they can see is light and a weird lacking of others senses. As if someone had pushed the mute button on them.¬†

¬†¬†¬†

Chapter 3. Y‚Äôall know I used to be really good at Wii sports tennis?

¬†¬†Then Bam! They are all suddenly on their backs looking up at the sky, but not their sky‚Ä¶ They all sit up again (as this is truly a bitch of a morning) as they take in their newer surroundings. Gone is the familiar room shoved full of games and books. Replaced with a vast openness of rocky terrain as far as their poor squinting eyes can see (well, minus Fate as they have the good sense to keep their hat straight) (Hmmm, funny might be the only straight thing about them). Dotting the area around them are various rock buds from a toe sized (no not Toe sized, toe sized I mean come on) to bowling ball sized.¬†

¬†¬†¬†Many of them start to scream and Fate shouts ‚ÄúWhere the fuck are we?‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†That is when your poor Narrator turned GM (Muahaha) starts to narrate about their first spren encounter! Semitranslucent yellow triangles appear before the friends as the triangles begin to shatter.¬†

¬†¬†¬†They stand and look around, but before they can do anything the sounds of screams and shouts come from beyond a crest in the landscape. They turn their attention towards that direction as the shock spren fade away. In their stead purple glops of goo start to rise from the ground at their feet, quickly intermixing with the anticipation spren of red banners.

¬†¬†Your Narrator, their GM, asks them if there's anything they would like to do, as the sounds of panic get close enough, they can begin to pick out individual voices.

¬†¬†¬†Toe asks to see if he can pull off one of the rock buds. I wave the strength check (as they have yet to unlock a character sheet) and he successfully rips free one of the bowling ball-sized ones from the ground. The leafy parts at the top shooting down into the center. Toe finds out he can reach in and grab the plant part and now has a makeshift club quickly followed by a second one. Merc quickly follows suit and is similarly armed. Both looking quite foolish but hey desperate times and all that. Clover and Fate‚Ä¶ Hmmm what was it that they did? Your forgetful Narrator has a bad memory it seems but lets say they did a similar. So, we have a whole team of my dear, silly-looking friends with their hands shoved up a bowling ball plant, looking like a Mii character from the Wii. Thus armed they turn to the horizon as the first of the figures to show up crest the hill.¬†

I‚Äôve played in a few bands in the past and had plenty of guitar solos and lead vocal songs, 5hr days, sound setups, etc. I booked a 2hr solo gig at a coffee shop this weekend for tips and I‚Äôm a little bit worried for it. Theres something different about balancing all of the components of a band on yourself. You can make a misstep in a group and no one will notice, but solo the mistakes are magnified because there‚Äôs nothing to hide behind.

I come from a lead guitar background, so not having the ability to fill space with guitar licks or solos makes me feel somewhat naked. I‚Äôve been working on my voice a bunch and making decent progress there, but I‚Äôve gotta cram some lyric memorization last minute. I worry about having to recall lyrics, vocal technique, guitar skills, and crowd interaction all while keeping the beat steady and monitoring the sound. With it being my first completely solo gig I‚Äôm feeling a bit of nerves too.

It‚Äôs only for tips so the stakes are not high, I‚Äôm just hoping that people will enjoy it. I‚Äôve been practicing a ton and it‚Äôs not that I feel unprepared, more that I‚Äôm debuting many these of these songs so they‚Äôre not as ‚Äúlocked in‚Äù as songs I‚Äôve done with my bands more times than I can count.

I have 4 years of EA to c-suite experience. 

 There are 300 applicants per job. Advice on the internet and training courses and such advise that in this post-pandemic AI riddled market and economic downturn, the best way to get a job is to reach out to the hiring manager directly. Bypassing recruiters and HR and asking for coffees in order to essentially get a job by approaching hiring managers directly. 

This obviously doesn't work for EAs because our hiring manager so to speak would be a CEO.. and guess who's protecting the inbox of the CEO? Yes their existing EA of course LOL. 

So who do you think I should do outreach too? Do you think I should aim for Chief of staff or operations manager? Or just stick with reaching out to HR and recruiters? 

Who is a decision maker on hiring EAs without accidentally getting into the inbox the EA is protecting?

I'm not saying I want to steal someone's job. I'm just saying I want to get seen because maybe it's a big business and they have a need for multiple EAs in different departments and I just don't want to risk an overprotective EA or a mean girl blocking me if you know what I mean.

fast forward 2 years, as i'm in college, things have changed, they're not so uptight about me going out anymore, but still more than average parents. i have classes 6 days a week, and i come back home during the late evening just before sundown. not even a moment's rest and they hurl chores at me. i might sound like i'm throwing a tantrum here regarding chores and i admit that i am very lazy with them, but i do what i'm told mostly, the reason why i hate doing it is because they find a way to nitpick and nag at me for ""not doing it right"". like i could sweep the entire house but get blamed for leaving a single strand of hair somewhere. even right now i'm typing this from my bathroom because if i stay on my phone too long in front of them thats a problem too. 
my degree requires less study, more practical work and i'm always swamped with asaingments, but somehow they have found a way to tell me i'm ""making excuses"" when i tell them i'm too busy. i'm banned from staying in my room because ""i stay there too long"". but then when i sit with them and try to talk and tell them college stories i get no reaction, or worse, a lecture that is completely unrelated to the topic. or just a ""you talk too much"". i know if i just work a little harder on paying more attention to help out with house chores everything will be fine. but i genuinely miss cues and forget, i wanna see a professional to check if i have ADHD, lots of my friends eho have it say that i exhibit signs, but if my parents tell me i'm 100% sure they'll say i'm making excuses again. my dad is giving me the silent treatment (apart from the usual nagging of course) and honestly, i'm too tired to care. this morning my mother made me coffee and i just added a pinch more because i like mine strong and he just straight up told me that he'll ""stop my coffee intake"" because i'm ""addicted"". there's no point in apologizing genuinely because everytime i do that, i'm met with a ""what are you sorry for"" and a ""i don't need your apology"". i cannot open up and express my feelings too because they use the most sensitive thoughts i think about myself as weapons against me during a fight. ""you don't listen at all, then you complain about feeling this way"" type of things and it hurts. i genuinely don't know what to do.",2,1760063799.0,Advice,7,1.0,False

Hey, fellow creators! üåü Have you ever found yourself staring at the clock at work, daydreaming about ‚Äúliving your BEST life‚Äù with a cozy laptop and a coffee shop view? I used to be in that same boat, but guess what? The tides have turned and we can now ride the AI wave straight into the land of hustling that doesn‚Äôt suck! üöÄ

Listen, the traditional 9-to-5 grind is sooo yesterday. With the rise of AI tools, there‚Äôs a whole new world of opportunities just waiting for us to dive in. Ready to explore? Here are some beginner-friendly ways to cash in on the AI boom before we all start seeing ""AI Overload"" as a new norm:

**1. Content Creation Magic üé©‚ú®**  
- **Blogging like a boss**: You can use AI to help brainstorm topics, assist with research, and generate engaging content. It's like having a super-smart assistant at your fingertips!
- **Video Content**: Want to start a YouTube channel but don‚Äôt know where to begin? AI can help with scripting and even video editing tasks. Who knew editing could be as easy as pressing a button?! 

**2. Social Media Manager Extraordinaire**  
- **Automate posts**: There are tools out there that can schedule all your posts for you. Spend less time on social media and more time... like literally living your life!
- **Engagement Insights**: Unlock the secrets of what your audience loves. Use AI analytics to get the scoop on the kind of content that‚Äôs lighting up their feeds.

**3. Design Your Dreams üåà**  
- **Graphic design with a twist**: Platforms like Canva have integrated AI that suggest design elements. So if you can't draw a stick figure properly, you're still golden!
  
**4. Build and Sell Products üõí**  
- **Digital Products**: Think ebooks, printables, or online courses. Use AI tools to create content automatically or personalize your offerings to fit market demands in a snap.
  
**5. Affiliate Marketing Wizardry**  
- Not sure how to start? Find a niche, pair it with the right tools, and watch how AI can help maximize your earnings. As an example, check out this brilliant AI tool I stumbled upon: [Easy Peasy AI](https://easy-peasy.ai/?via=aca). I‚Äôve found it super helpful in enhancing my workflow‚Äîjust sharing because I think you'd love it too! (Small note: it‚Äôs an affiliate link, so I might earn a bit if you decide to go for it. Just keeping it transparent! üòä)

The best part? You don‚Äôt have to quit your day job immediately if you‚Äôre not ready. You can slowly build your AI-powered side hustle while still clocking in. Who knows? You might love it so much that you‚Äôll wave goodbye to the cubicle life sooner than you thought! 

Have you started using any AI tools yet? What‚Äôs been your experience? Let‚Äôs swap stories! Or, even better, what dreams do you have of escaping that 9-to-5 and going all-in on your creativity? üëÄ",1,1760063629.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

Scared, anxious, hyper-aware of everything and everyone, like life is this constant background hum of dread I can never switch off. Every day feels like a small war, just to smile, to act normal, to not crumble under the noise inside my own head.

It‚Äôs weird how exhausting existing can be. People wake up, grab coffee, go out, talk, laugh, like it‚Äôs nothing. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm here doing mental gymnastics just to step outside. Even brushing my teeth or answering a message feels like preparing for combat. Every single thing demands effort and energy I don‚Äôt even know where to find anymore.

There was a time I thought I‚Äôd outgrow this, that I‚Äôd learn to fight back, rebuild myself, become that ‚Äúnormal‚Äù 24-year-old who travels, socializes, goes for haircuts, just lives. But here I am, still struggling to even make eye contact with the guy at the stationery shop. I hadn‚Äôt shown up there in 10 months, and when he casually asked where I‚Äôd been, my brain short-circuited. Ten months of hiding, and I couldn‚Äôt even form a proper answer. Just grabbed my pen and left before the walls closed in.

I have an exam tomorrow. I‚Äôve given exams all my life, but somehow, the journey to the exam center terrifies me more than the exam itself. It‚Äôs a place I‚Äôve been to so many times, yet every time feels like the first. Heart pounding, thoughts racing, body tensing up like I‚Äôm walking into something dangerous. It‚Äôs stupid, I know. I tell myself that every time. But knowing doesn‚Äôt fix it.

People think anxiety is just overthinking. It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs this invisible chokehold that grips you in the most ordinary moments. A haircut. A bus ride. A conversation. Even joy feels suspicious, like something I haven‚Äôt earned or can‚Äôt trust.

Sometimes I look at myself, 24, supposedly an adult, and feel like I missed every checkpoint of growing up. Everyone seems to be running ahead, jobs, relationships, plans, futures. And I‚Äôm just here, trying to breathe normally, trying not to let my brain convince me that everything‚Äôs falling apart.

This post is about seeking anyone in Dayton that knows of a weekly rental situation ‚Äî only while I get situated, and can have my cat back with me immediately. I do not drink/smoke/have any addictions(except for coffee ‚òïÔ∏è but even that‚Äôs tame), and I am really just seeking a safe and quaint place to lay my head, with my cat by my side(as she deserves ‚Äî- I can‚Äôt imagine her anxiety and stress since I‚Äôve vanished from her day-to-day after her whole lifetime. 


Is anyone willing to allow me to, quite literally, sleep on their floor, and bring my (super trained)cat? 

You have permission to point a security camera all day on me (to trust me, and feel safe) if you‚Äôre considering let me sleep on your floor. As long as I can be with my cat -I do not care. She will lay directly beside me, 100% guaranteed. She is well trained and stays by my side. She is over 18‚Äî not a crazy kitten ‚Äî a docile, lazy bones cat, who has lived a longgggg time, and really needs her life-long owner with her. 

Btw:  I know my posts make me come off like an eccentric person, but I am actually very much calm, cool, and collected.

Does anyone know of a place to rent from that is weekly(and safe !)? 

Does anyone - literally anyone- have any ideas that I haven‚Äôt had of my own, that can work, are safe and cat-friendly?

Hotels kind of scare me because I am a smaller person, and there‚Äôs a lot of traffic at places like that. I don‚Äôt have a car, and would need to be in a walkable area - and on bus line. And I don‚Äôt want anyone messing with my cat if I was to leave to go to a job.

I can supply professional and personal references. This includes my most recent General Manager , from the job I lost when the incident (that ultimately lead me to the shelter) occurred. And like I said, If you allow me on your floor, I don‚Äôt care if you want to record me, or set rules. Just as long as I can be with my cat, and keep her safe , nothing else bothers me.


I think I would be scared living in a motel . I think the floor of a strangers home , who uses and likes Reddit and likes cats, is way less intimidating‚Äî‚Äî-  I know that it‚Äôs likely not possible. My cat is an amazing animal, and she is so sweet and wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. I‚Äôd take the best care of the tiny space I‚Äôd given any, and clean up everything . Her litter box would be taken care of, and she would be respectful.

Hi All



I‚Äôm feeling a lot at this point in time. I don‚Äôt want any skeptics in the comments, flo is very much real and my brother is lost, probably forever. Not up for discussion here so take it somewhere else. Ash, my brother, has been living in Florida for the last three years. It had been maybe a year since we last contacted each other before I received this string of emails, they very clearly document the outbreak. Fair warning for anyone else who may have loved ones living in Florida or Georgia.



**July 12, 2024 - Been a While**

Hey, Ellie,

I know we haven‚Äôt talked in a while. Maybe I‚Äôm writing to keep my thoughts straight, maybe because I need someone who still feels real in the midst of this strange heat that hums under my skin and refuses to leave.

Last weekend started ordinary enough. Cal‚Äôs friend got us into a new place near the station, it had old church lights strung like relics above the bar, glowing faintly red, soft as a heartbeat. The smell of spilled gin and perfume clung to everything, and beneath it lingered something metallic, electric, like static hiding in corners.

We were all there: Avery with his crooked grin, Lena sketching faces on napkins, her hair catching the light like strands of neon, and me, pretending I hadn‚Äôt forgotten how to feel alive. The night hummed around us, Ellie, music vibrating through ribs, laughter spilling like heat through the air.

Then it tilted. Avery was eying his glass with an intensity that honestly scared me a little but Avery is intense anyway. He whispered that the light looked ‚Äúdifferent tonight.‚Äù Lena nodded silently, I could feel her pulse fast against my arm, her eyes were bright and darted around the room. The air felt alive, electric, like a storm waiting to strike.

Shots were suggested, probably by me, and everything blurred from that point on.

Cal disappeared. We found him arguing with a stranger outside. I don‚Äôt fight anymore Ellie, we tried getting him out of it. Cal actually seemed desperate, not angry. The man was big and bald, his veins popped out his skin and has some weird quality to them that I can‚Äôt place. They looked really, blue? Cal‚Äôs hands would not let go of the man‚Äôs shirt, though he repeated, ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt touch me.‚Äù Avery pulled them apart and the stranger staggered into the dark, laughing. Cal whispered, voice low and trembling, ‚ÄúHis skin was burning, like there was fire under his skin.‚Äù

We laughed it off, claiming drunkenness. But I knew the man didn‚Äôt look right. He was probably high. On the walk home, streetlights flickered. Brief blackouts left images of everyone‚Äôs faces in my retina. I remember very little from the many conversations of that night. There was a weird moment with Leone though. At my door, she hugged me, pulse thumping against my collarbone. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. It‚Äôs just starting,‚Äù she whispered. I didn‚Äôt know what she meant.

Cal called in sick the next day. He claimed sickness but we had all seen the man down seven pints the night before. Leone and I went for coffee, chatted about Cal‚Äôs near miss with the bald guy. As I picked up my spoon the thing shocked me hard enough to draw blood. Am I imagining that? The cut is still healing so that‚Äôs real. It felt like how I was a few years ago, you know. I‚Äôm really not drinking like I was, it doesn‚Äôt make sense that I‚Äôm seeing things.

I‚Äôve been dreaming about that night, the red lights, the heat, the stranger‚Äôs veins, the hum beneath it all.

I‚Äôm fine Ellie. Missing you every day

Love,  
Ash



**July 14, 2024 - Errands**

Ellie,

Something is definitely up.

Went to the shops today, moving through the city ordinarily, the air had a strange weight, like invisible fingers brushing along nerves. People move differently now, their hands linger, their shoulders graze almost purposefully, faces catch light strangely and eyes flicker.

The shopkeeper was cute as anything. Tall, blond, muscles rolling under a snug T-shirt, his laugh warm and easy as he rang up some old ladies groceries. Every glance, every casual brush of his hand sent tiny shocks up my arms, made the tiles hum beneath my feet and my stomach twist. He reached to scratch his neck and I saw it very clearly, the veins in his forearm were definitely glowing. Visibly glowing, like nothing I‚Äôve ever seen before. I lingered longer than necessary, pretending to compare cereal brands, and he smiled again, faintly blushing, electricity thrumming between us.

At the register, Cal dropped a link into our group chat with a caption: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trending üòÇüòÇüòÇ.‚Äù Leone laughed ‚Äúof course we‚Äôve got the next big thing since covid.‚Äù I looked down at what Cal had sent more closely. Fluorescent Artery Syndrome, it‚Äôs like a wildfire in Miami apparently. You‚Äôve probably seen it by now, google it. That is what‚Äôs behind all that weird shit I‚Äôve been noticing with people‚Äôs veins. I won‚Äôt lie, it looks kinda sweet but I could miss these feverish symptoms I‚Äôve been getting. The pull of the city and the hum threading under every surface makes me feel dizzy.

Lots of Love,  
Ash

**July 15, 2024 - Leone‚Äôs Birthday**

Ellie,

Leone mentioned her birthday casually as we walked toward the first bar: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be twenty-four on Sunday. I want three bars, for symmetry.‚Äù She laughed softly, brushing her hair from her face. She moved with an ease that was mesmerizing, almost luminous, other than the bright streaks of red and blue flowing down her neck you couldn‚Äôt tell she was ill. Why are we all ok with this? Clearly we‚Äôre spreading it everywhere we go, it‚Äôs infectious enough for me to have gotten it simply from living in the same apartment as her.

Each bar was crowded, phones buzzed simultaneously with emergency alerts. Instead of panic, people cheered, clinked glasses, eyes catched neon shimmer on strangers‚Äô veins. You‚Äôve seen it now for sure, it‚Äôs trending nationally and now internationally. I felt the pulse of it under the floorboards, threading through the music, the lights, even the vibration of laughter.

Alex twirled a bottle like it was a baton, Leone leaned on a railing, Cal‚Äôs fingers traced metal edges. Their movements showed control, fascination, communion. The pull of Flo whispered in my veins, teasing me toward surrender even as I watched, slightly afraid of this weird trance everyone seems to be in.

Love,

Ash

**July 16, 2024 - Carnival**

Ellie,

Government crackdown has come, every bar has been temporarily shut. Social gatherings are now completely against the law. Everyone remembers Covid though, no one is following the rules, certainly not us. Actually a ‚Äòprotest‚Äô carnival was set up the same day the measures were brought in, which is where we went tonight. The city swarmed with flashing police vehicles across alleys where the carnival waited, illegal but alive, vibrating with neon and bass that shook the asphalt. Music pounded, dancers danced, and the smell of sweat, and chicharron mingled with the metallic tang of electricity in the air. People spun on clanky rides, leapt over neon puddles that reflected their veins glowing beneath their skin, bodies pulsing in rhythm with the street.

Then someone bent over a lamppost and vomited. Thick, neon yellow-orange, sticky and pulsating, almost alive in the light. The smell was sweet and intoxicating. Alex clapped, Leone doubled over laughing, Cal danced around it, fingers tracing shapes in the luminous mess. I froze, both horrified and entranced, as the three of them laughed hysterically, pointing, almost touching, drawn to the glowing sickness like it was art. The hum pulled at me, enticing, but my stomach turned.

Alex‚Äôs hand lingered on my wrist, Leone brushed close, eyes sparkling with something manic, almost erotic, attempting to direct my full attention to the neon vomit. My stomach tightened, my pulse thrummed with the hum, but fear struck me deep. Today I saw the pull of the Fever. I am scared, most people seem to have it myself included. I want to get away from my friends until they recover, it‚Äôs getting weird. We stayed well into the night, no one seemed tired, I‚Äôm sure the carni will go on until the sun comes back up.

**July 17, 2024 - Dangerous**

Ellie,

The news went fully international today. We saw what happened on TV, than fuck for that. I wouldn‚Äôt have liked to see that in real life. I can‚Äôt stop rewatching the video on twitter, the man‚Äôs leg was torn off. Still his face, his face, was pure euphoric ecstasy. The camera trembled as the crowd pressed closer, limbs bending impossibly, pulling at him, tearing, crushing, the blood glowing red-orange and spilling onto the road, pulsing in time with the crowd‚Äôs cheers.

While we watched the live coverage Alex watched silently, fascinated. Leone shivered, biting her lip. Cal murmured something about neurotransmitters. They seemed completely captivated, like they wanted to go out and join the mob to tear up the next person. I felt the Fever‚Äôs pull, but this‚Ä¶ this was horror. Vivid and electric. I couldn‚Äôt look away. I know I have to get out.



**July 25, 2024 - I Tried**

Ellie,

I‚Äôve left them. Packed quietly, slipped from the apartment while they murmured, swaying, glowing. The streets are barricaded, checkpoints are dense with soldiers, veins faintly bright beneath uniforms, eyes wide and piercing. Drones hover, two on every street.

I ran and ran and ran. Rhythm carried me, I could feel my feet bleed in my shoes I ran so much., My Heartbeat echoed in tandem with the distant cheers of mobs of people. You won‚Äôt hear about the bloomings, which is what they‚Äôve called the ritual since its gory TV debut. Let me tell you there‚Äôs easily been over 200 since my last message. I bounced off walls, I ducked beneath flashing lights, I leaped obstacles. Miami cannot be escaped. Every port and entrance is tightly secured by the military now, they are disciplined and uninfected. Every yacht has been sunk. No one is going anywhere. The city hums, but I am lucid, alone, and frightened.

I stacked up on food and I‚Äôve slept the streets for days now, I‚Äôm smart and I stay hidden. Flo draws me like a magnet to the city monuments, to electrical generators and anywhere where a mob could gather. I am fighting a tremendous mental battle every second my eyes are open. Even when I sleep I am overwhelmed with images of her electric figure. I will stay strong sister. I will keep fighting.

Ash



**July 28, 2024 - Love**

Ellie,

I am lost, and found, and burning all at once. The Fever is love, Ellie, the warmest, brightest, most alive love I have ever known. Every pulse, every laugh, every sticky drop of neon vomit or spilled blood is a caress and a scream and a song. I am in it, and it calls to you.

Do you remember summers on the beach with Mom? Barefoot, chasing each other, hands entwined, laughing as the waves chased us? It‚Äôs that, multiplied, electrified, neon, waiting for you. You can come, Ellie. You *must*. I‚Äôll show you the hum, I‚Äôll show you the glow. We will scream, laugh, burn with her love beneath our skin.

I am Ash. I am the pulse. I am the glow. I will make you see it. I will make you love it. I will make you glow. Florida cannot hold me, I will come to you. I will break through every barrier, every checkpoint, every wall. I will reach you.

Come to me. Glow. I am coming, Ellie.

Love,  
Ash

1o2osly,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1o2osly/bad_texter_or_not_mormon/,bad texter? or not mormon?,"so i (22m) live in utah. mormons everywhere. i am not religious. 

me and this girl in my english class hadn‚Äôt ever really talked in class other than a passing word or two. well i was at a protest on campus, and we both noticed each other at the same time. i struck up a convo and asked her about a paper that was due the night before. from there we walk around a bit having a normal conversation for two college kids who just met. then after an hour we split and went home. 

about thirty minutes later, she adds me on snapchat. i add her back, and we text for a couple days. still not very deep conversation, not flirty. she would react to my messages with heart reactions but that‚Äôs as flirty as it got. when she would send video snaps of her talking instead of the usual text, i‚Äôd reply the same way. but still, i would ask her about herself and lightly joke but absolutely nothing flirty or controversial whatsoever. 

at one point she reacted to a message but didn‚Äôt add anything. i left her on delivered to see if she valued the convo enough revive it. sure enough she messages me like 2 hours later and we continued texting back and forth. i‚Äôve texted many people where i can tell they‚Äôre not interested, but this convo didn‚Äôt feel that way to me. 

so immediately the first thing i noticed about her account after she first added me was that she had three cross emojis in her bio. again, im from utah so that almost always means she‚Äôs mormon here. i decided i was going to show up to my english class with a mcdonald‚Äôs coffee and try to gauge if she was super mormon or not. well she didn‚Äôt talk to me, and i‚Äôve been on delivered since then (2 days). 

i‚Äôm not asking how i can salvage this. what i‚Äôm wondering is if the cut communication was due to how i was texting her (not flirting) or if the coffee thing really could have been a dealbreaker. are there factors i‚Äôm not considering? what are good tips when texting new friends?
