1p9yk8t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p9yk8t,"through sheer luck and perseverance, i beat third palace boss in wonder level 58","it's somewhat an update to my previous post before about going through the palaces too fast and being underleveled, still at wonder level 50-ish with level 60 thieves.  
in previous post i was at wonder level 51, now im at wonder level 58.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1p4z3om/am\_i\_going\_through\_the\_palaces\_too\_fast/](https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1p4z3om/am_i_going_through_the_palaces_too_fast/)

back then, i said i planned not to pull on any limited banner until p3 protag comes since im not a ""daily login gacha player"" to earn meta jewels on an everyday basis, but i decided to 'have fun now' instead of later, so i pulled for badass nuclear explosion biker lady (been my favorite since her p5 awakening scene) and her weapon, which i lost 50/50 to soy 5\* permafrost (holy wow its def down help is so useful). cattle 5\* weapon is bought from exchange since i find gundam mecha persona so cool i had to max him out.

considering i cant level up my thieves and weapons, my only other avenues is revelation cards, so i used what coffee recharges i have to get on-set revelation cards with correct main stats. i was unlucky with closer's renewal set (not that she helps since boss is resistant to electric moreso i wanted to build her generally), but in return i got soy's control all hp set with crit rate substats (to ignore weaknesses and down enemies with gun in mook battles). cattle's love set is from exchanging event currencies, full atk for starfire buff and sp recovery substat to ensure he doesnt run out when healing every turn. queen's cards are random off-set gold cards using hp, mult, crit rate and atk main stats with crit rate substats (and unintentional but welcome sp recovery substats). all cards leveled to 25 max with the top cards being on-set (except queen) purple 20 max.

within the in-battle info, >!the forced story wind elucidator is level 54/56 (i forgot) with 5\* weapon and trust+prosperity set (the faster highlight cycles helps, since my own wind uses labor set with no matching top card)!<

\------

as for the boss fight itself, i wasnt actually expecting to win due to 120 turn limit, it's more for observing what moves and characteristics the boss have so i get a good idea of how the boss works when i reach the next wonder level threshold.

considering i am severely underleveled with level 60 thieves whereas level 80 thieves is recommended, my first try is full defense with ex-machina (nuclear attribute buff), mithras marakukaja, and arahabaki tarunda.

food item is used for damage reduction buff.

as expected the boss hits hard, so damn hard it always drops my health to 20% from full health. cattle always heals every turn and soy activates icy defense whenever available. that is, until wonder died on the eyes phase, but i continued anyway since i want to see how the phase works.

it's only at this point i noticed that cattle, soy, and queen all can survive consistently without wonder's defense. i lost to 120 turn limit when dealing with the top eyes.

knowing that i cant win with my underleveled thieves, my current self-imposed personal goal is to beat the top eyes phase so i can observe how the final phase (foreshadowing) is like, to become prepared for the boss when my wonder level ascends to a higher tier.

considering the team doesnt need wonder's defense, my second strategy is to employ wonder on buffing duty using ame-no-uzume crit boosts and jikokuten tarukaja+matarukaja (with janosik stat stick). ex-machina set to physical attribute buff from jikokuten so soy's smash hit deal a tiny bit more damage.

thanks to the buffs, i can beat the first two phases at a faster pace than before. though, wonder's lower tier personas does mean he has lower stats, as he gets killed one-shot at full health whenever the boss uses wild strike and gigantomachia. it's either i continue on with wonder knocked out thus no more buffs for higher damage output or i play defensively to keep wonder alive for him to apply buffs but at a generally slower pace due to having to guard or icy defense. either way, both lost to 120 turn limit when dealing with top eyes.

afterwards, i decided to search reddit for guides and tips about third palace boss. i see limited meta units recommendations, team synergy compositions, persona choices, or levelling up wonder level and thieves for plain better stats.

one thing that strikes me is this suggestion from this user comment by ""therbier"" [https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1p88k7g/comment/nr390iz/](https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1p88k7g/comment/nr390iz/) about using pazuzu curse to deal off-turn damage (though i dont have joker). i spent another coffee recharge to grab the persona then overclocked it and wow, it makes a lot of difference, as the curse deals significant dot damage while wonder does something else like buffing.

my third strategy now employs cycling between attacking with pazuzu eigaon curses and applying rakunda (so queen nukes, wonder curses, and soy smash hits all deal higher damage). i kept tarukaja to buff queen during the cooldown phases since the boss cant be attacked/debuffed with anything during then.

ex-machina with pazuzu (70) on curse attribute buff for higher curse dot damage, arahabaki (60) for rakunda and tarukaja, janosik (70) as atk and def stat stick. these leveled personas should give me enough attack for damage and defense to survive the oneshots.

food item is used for damage increase buff.

\------

thus the third strategy boss fight is as such:

\[boss attacks\]

1.soy gun def down

2.wonder arahabaki rakunda

3.cattle starfire (owl green/healing satellite) on queen

4.queen sanction drift

\[boss attacks\]

5.wind support scatter plum

5.soy smash hit def down

6.queen highlight

6.wonder pazuzu eigaon

7.cattle owl fire (little bit of damage help to ensure boss dies in this cycle)

8.queen crash out and thermonuclear fury

\[boss attacks, dies from curse, enters cooldown\]

9.soy guard

10.wonder arahabaki tarukaja on queen

11.cattle healing satellite on wonder

12.queen president heal for atk buff

\[boss attacks, next phase starts\]

at this point, there's no rigid strategy. the most important thing is to time icy defense whenever boss throws tantrum or tarukaja to ensure wonder doesnt get killed one-shot at full health and only smash hit whenever ""wrath dies down"" text comes up.

wonder attacks with pazuzu eigaon while keeping rakunda applied.

queen is on s1>crashout>s3>s3 cycle and cattle always on healing satellite.

wind supports with cycling scatter plum and verngale petals.

highlights cycle between queen for reapplying elemental ailments to technical the second thermonuclear fury and cattle to alleviate sp consumption (use heal highlight then guard instead of healing satellite).

if the boss targets one ally, they must guard else they get killed one-shot.

if cattle is targeted, ensure he has highlight heal before guarding else he falls (since guarding at low health still kills him and full-health healing with skill without guarding kills him too).

if soy is targeted, just smash hit, he can tank the full brunt of the targeted attack at full health without guard.

worth noting that, unlike my past attempts, it seems i beat the second phase fast enough before the boss can cast ire shield.

on cooldown before eye phase, everyone guards to conserve sp. post-cooldown boss attack is a basic survivable strong aoe that can be healed, but the next one is gigantomachia so i need to have soy icy defense at the ready so wonder doesnt get killed one-shot.

at turn 94 (which is the last time i checked the turn count when looking at top eyes phase, it could've been actually be more than the 100th+ turn), i managed to destroy the last nuke-resistant top eye thanks to eigaon curses. since cooldown phase takes 4 turns leaving me with approximately 20 turns left for final phase, i was assured that my thieves are too weak to beat the boss fast enough for the last phase, so i thought i'll just observe how the final phase is like and leave the boss battle be until my wonder level is higher. i consider this a small victory as a casual player for the success of my self-imposed personal challenge.

that is, as it turns out >!the top eyes phase ***is*** the last phase after all???!<

>!i thought there was another final phase for one last showdown beatdown after destroying the cables, so it comes as a surprise for me when a story cutscene plays after breaking the top eyes,!< that hits me with the fact that yes, i actually beat third palace boss in wonder level 58 with level 60 thieves. it felt unreal, considering i see reddit posts struggling to beat third palace boss with level 70 or even level 80 thieves, and i beat it with an even lower level 60.

\------

i would have wanted to video record the attempt but unfortunately, i dont have the battle recorded. this is part due to not knowing that i beat the final phase in my practice run and by then, the win story cutscene already played and i cant go back. realm of repression only unlocks the level 58 boss (as is my wonder level) instead of the story level 80 boss, with the level 80 realm of repression boss locked behind wonder level.

that was quite a surprisingly rapid development, since back then i was unable to beat the password door miniboss due to turn limit. i suppose taking my time and building up the revelation cards do make a significant difference in performance, alongside pulling for queen which elevates my dps while having 5\* weapons for cattle and soy that elevates their supportive capabilities.

which begs me the question, did i really beat the boss everyone was struggling on while being underleveled or did it ever have a nerf patch thus i beat a weaker version of it?

i heard that palaces are now being scaled to wonder level, which is evidenced by the new crossover pyramid palace having level 58 boss due to being scaled to my wonder level, but i looked at the battle info for third palace story boss and it has a value of more than 80+ level. the story minibosses of the power plant repairs are also at level 78-82 too, even the wandering shadow mooks in the power plant has red aura on them.

anyhow, i still cant get past the gatekeeper level 78 bosses in mementos path of chemdah due to their gimmicks, my thieves just gets wiped out and die easily. i guess i'll wait until wonder level 60 for level 70 thieves before tackling them on.",1,1764447169.0,personaphantomx,0,1.0,False

I'm Michael (Mike), 27 years old, and I live in Germany. I can speak English, German, and Polish (though I don't write well in Polish). I can be a bit reserved at first, but once I get comfortable, I'm all in and pretty much an open book at that point. I value honesty and loyalty, and I'm always trying to grow and improve.

**Why I'm Posting**

Lately, I've been stuck in my thoughts, and I'm trying to get out of the loop. Finding new friends is one way I think could really help me. I actually have close friends I've known for 12+ years, but they're all on the west coast of the US now, so timezones have been tough since I moved back to Germany. That's part of why I'm looking to connect with people closer to my timezone.

I'm not looking for a big group or server—just hoping to connect with genuine people. I love daily conversations and just checking in on how someone's day went. Whether we're gaming together, watching something, or just chilling on call doing our own thing—I'm flexible and easy going. Whether it's talking about life, vibing in silence, or sending random memes at 2AM—I'm here for it.

I connect best with people who are easy going and non-judgmental. I struggle with self-confidence sometimes, so finding people I really click with can take time, but once I do, I'm all in.

**My Interests**

I'll be honest—most of my hobbies are pretty solo. That's just how I grew up and what I gravitated toward. But I enjoy talking about them and hearing what other people are into.

**Music** has always been important to me. I used to make beats—mostly freestyle, trap, and phonk style—and I might get back into it soon. I'm all over the place with genres:

* Rock / Metal / Metalcore
* Rap / Underground Hip-Hop
* Trance / DnB / Phonk / Hardstyle

**Other Stuff I'm Into**

* Binging shows and movies—I'm into old comedies and action films, and I want to get more into horror/scary movies too. Always open to recommendations or watching stuff together
* Just generally falling down rabbit holes. If it's weird or fascinating, I'm in
* Gaming (PC) - I play a mix of tactical shooters, survival games, and RPGs when I want to unwind

**A Bit About My Life**

I work in an office right now—mostly desk work—but I'm looking to get into IT since I know quite a bit about computers. When the weather's nice, I love getting outside and enjoying nature. And there's something about thunderstorms at night—just watching the lightning and chilling—that hits different.

I'm also slowly getting into working out, nothing crazy, just trying to be more active.

I'm a night owl, especially on days off and weekends. During the week when I work, I usually stay up till 11pm-12am. But on nights before my days off? 3-5am is my zone.

For Christmas, I would like to buy for my parents (and for myself while i am in process of moving out) a new superautmatic machine to replace our DeLonghi Magnifica S from like 2016 +-1year (no idea tbh).

There are black friday deals in my area, i was eyeing a new DeLonghi machine but I am willing to try some new brand (i got good info about Gaggia for example).  
Budget is around **500€**, but of course I would love to save money if its worth it, I am mostly seeking something that is REALLY good and price is second priority.  
**We dont care at all about milk drinks**, we have separate equipment for it and even that is rarely used.  
I would really like to be able to set ml (or at least choose from preset) and dose (although we nearly always drink extra strong, but its good to be able to set) and any other settings are a bonus, although we require the setting to be storable, to allow for set-and-forget when we are busy.

For maintenance, of course we want something reliable and proven but we have experience with maintaing the Magnifica S, so something that is similar in terms of maintenance (or lower) would be perfect.

This will be very long, just a warning. To start, I want to say that despite everything my parents have done, I do love them and wish that we could have a relationship but based off the fact that I have tried for YEARS to make it work, none of my parents are capable of admitting fault, respecting boundaries or adjusting their behavior. I also want to admit that I was not perfect either. When I lived with them periodically as a young adult, like 20s I would steal their weed and alcohol. I have since stopped drinking alcohol, made amends to them, and paid them back. I say this for honesty and transparency and I only recently cut them off. I'm 38 and have not since repeated my negative behavior with them. My birth mom has told me that when I was born, she ‘knew I was a little mother’. My mom and dad are both practicing alcoholics and drug addicts. Once they had my younger brother and sister, my mom still had this weird delusion that I was their mother, and at times I felt like she also considered me her mother in a sense. I do want to mention that she was sexually abused by her father and not believed/gaslight by her mother about the situation. I know she, along with my other parents, had a very rough childhood. However, that did not give them the right to take it out on me. Anyway, I distinctly remember her being gone for days and would lock herself in her room all day. That would leave be at 5, 6 and 7 years old to care for my 18 month younger sister and my brother, who was actually a baby. So, I would change his diapers, get both of them dressed make them breakfast and get them off to the bus stop for school. I would also cover their ears and sing to them when my mom and dad, or other men, would literally fist fight. They would both get drunk, start a fight, my mom would tell him to hit her, then was a victim when he did. He would cheat on her and hit her unprovoked too. I felt responsible to protect my siblings. I also want to mention that I don't remember taking care of them when I was really young, my sister told me. My brain obviously blocked out the trauma. But I do remember caring for them and protecting them around 9 or 10. This would include taking them on walks when they would fight and such. I also called the police on my dad multiple times. My parents had divorced when I was 5 and me caring for their basic needs started happening after that, when we lived with her as a single mom. My dad remarried. My stepmother did ‘give me back my childhood’ by being the parent and letting me be a kid, which i will always be grateful for. She was toxic However. For example, she would say horrible things to my dad, emasculating vindictive things. He was always drunk, I'm talking whiskey in his coffee, then his Gatorade at his construction job. After she would say these horrible things, which were either triggered by his immense immaturity, his drinking or the fact that he cheated on her, he would then beat her up and/or rape her. I would call the cops, he would sometimes go to jail, but she would always take him back. She was also WILDLY strict. I'm all for kids doing chores and being respectful, but we would spend 2 hours cleaning incessantly every day, and, for example, if we accidentally left a sock on the floor she would thrn scream at us for an hour. She had the need to control everything in her life and because she couldn't control ger alcoholic violent cheating bastard of a husband, she chose to take out all her control issues on us. I have always been a bigger woman, so she would constantly berated be for my weight. She would also do things like insult my looks, my dreams, things I was good at disguised as ‘constructive criticism’. What wad really going on was i was obviously younger, but also much prettier than her despite my weight, and she was/is the type of person that acts on her jealousy by attempting to tear others woman down instead of building them up because she wants what they have. I want to mention here that there is nothing wrong with being a bit jealous, what is wrong is attempting to mess with the person's self esteem, confidence and even trying to keep them from being more successful. I cannot stand people like that. She would also treat me differently when in front of men. She respects men, and not women, they are just competition to her. Anyway, so you are probably starting to see my reasoning for cutting them off. I also want to mention that my father is my grandma's only son and therefore can do no wrong. My grandma has always enabled his behavior, which is probably based in the face that my grandpa was a psycho and would beat him for small things, and he cheated on my grandma for most of their marriage with multiple woman. (He was the head of the agricultural department at a junior college and would use his status to sleep with his young female students. At one point he even gave some woman $15,000 then lied and said someone stole it, he didn’t know who, and even got the police involved). My grandpa did teach me some things about work ethic and respect that are invaluable to my life now, and he did help the environment and was a respected man in his field. He was a much better grandpa then father or husband. But, at one time he used my mental illness as a way to try and cover up his affairs while also trying to get me to join the military as a way to make me go away because he ‘knew I knew’. I also found out that he did the same thing with his own elderly mother, blaming her schizophrenia on why she saw him with other women. But he was still a better role model than my parents. (I'm aware this sounds insane, but I really had some crazy toxic adults in my life lol). There is a whole lot more to unpack there, but in the interest of time, I'll move on. Anyway, I kept my stepmother in my life until she in addition to criticize my weight, she started criticizing my younger daughters weight. I warned her twice to stop, but she didn’t, so I cut her off. I remember at one point sometime before that I was offered a professional singing job in a jazz orchestra and she said something along the lines of, how could you leave your husband on the weekends to take care of your girls and your girls should have their mother at home. It wasn’t obvious then, because I was used to and unaware of her tactics that she was just jealous and did not want me to have that kind of success. Anyway, back to my dad. He has always done and said whatever he wanted and wasn't told no or been made accountable by his mother, so he continued his ridiculous behavior. She would bail him out of jail, pay for rehab,etc. My dad has continued to emotionally and physically abuse his grown children (he slapped my sister once for calling out some of his atrocious behavior) when hammered, which was most days, he would project his hate for himself on us, like screaming I'm not a piece of shit, you are. And are you loosing it? And such over and over, like how drunk people repeat things and don't hear you. He also beat his third wife, made her keep it a secret, but we knew. His third wife had her problems, (anyone that would stay with a man like my father obviously would) but she was actually a very kind, good women, whom my father definitely did not deserve. They had been together 20 years when she got an incurable disease that would steadily cause her to become entombed in her body, then she would pass away. Very soon after this, when my father realized that she couldn't have sex with her anymore, he asked for an open relationship, she refused (that's not who she was) he decided to DIVORCE her. He tried to use the excuse that getting divorced would end up with her receiving better medical care, which i understand, but that is not why he divorced her. He through away 20 years of marriage to a beautiful wonderful woman that was actually going to die in 2 years, which he knew, because he didn't want to go without sex and because he didn't want to take care of her. Keep in mind, she worked full time, did all the cleaning and ‘kept him satisfied’ for TWENTY YEARS and he couldn't take a cold shower or downtown Lester brown for 2 years. Selfish motherfucker. There are about a million other deplorable things this man has done but I dont have time to list them. Like he called my brothers wife a pussy for not breastfeeding. My brother did choke him out, which was so enjoyable, especially since my dad used to beat my brother incessantly and it was the first time my brother was able to fight back. I still feel so satisfied when I think about it. Also, the last time I saw my dad (which was actually after I tried and almost succeeded at unaliving myself, I was in avoma for 10 days. And what's interesting is both my birth parents just had to see me, I would assume they blamed themselves a little) he wanted to pay for dinner and a movie for everyone but the timing didn't allow. Instead of adapting, he through a toddler temper tantrum by saying if we can't go to the movies he wouldn't pay for anything (which i didn't care about) but he also refused to talk to any of use and just stubbornly sat there. My sister had come with him, whom I adore, and we just continued enjoying our visit. Let the big baby have his tantrum. My dad has known for several years now that I will not take any of his shit, the gaslighting, abuse and outright selfishness, so he doesn't mess with me, however anyti.ei would stand up to him, call him out or whatever, he would ‘take it out’ on my siblings, not directly talking about me, just being a general drunk violent asshole to them. He would also try to ‘get to me’ through my grandma, then she would try and convince me to come back, like ‘your dad has such a hard time’ and ‘but he's your dad, and he loves you’ pretty much saying, he's your dad and he has a right to you, and you just have to accept him for who he is. I love my grandma very much, but she has problems too,like everybody else. For some reason, all ‘three’ of my parents have believed that they dont have to be accountable for their own actions, don't have to respect boundaries, and are entitled to me being around to make them feel better about themselves. I have been their emotional punching bag/hostage and they believe that all of this is ok simply because birthed me. This is not the case. So, once my sister told me she was done, cut of my dad, I sent him this message, then blocked him-

I want you to stop trying to contact you. I never want to see you or talk to you again. I'm sure you can imagine all the reasons why. And do NOT take this out on my siblings or try and use grandma to get to me- she does not need that. (Side note, my grandma has dementia). Now LEAVE ME ALONE. You do not deserve to be in my life, and I have no need for you. You're a monster.

He has left me alone since then. Now, for my birth mother and why we're done. In addition to the things you already know, she also left us with I developmentally disabled woman as a babysitter who would give me food and put me in front of the TV while she did things with my sister in her room. There was another ti.e when I was 10 or 11 and she attempted to ‘sell me’ to a 19 year old man ‘temporarily’ for drugs. Recently, my husband and I were dealing with a lying manipulating landlord and we have a few days to find somewhere to live with our two teenage girls. At that time I had put the past behind me and was trying to hold onto the last parent in my life. Things were OK for a few days, but my mom drinks all day everyday, and her view of reality is heavily skewed even without adding alcohol to the mix. She's one of those people that makes every single conversation about her, even if she has nothing to do with it. Like say, I would come to her sad about something, she would find a way to make what I said a personal attack against her. She would say something around the house was fine, but by 1 pm that same day it definitely wasn't fine, and then she would explain all the reasons why, which rarely made sense. Or if her concern was legitimate, I would apologize and attempt to correct the problem she had either with me, the kids or my husband (apparently every one of their actions she didn't like was MY responsibility and MY fault). I tried so hard all day everyday to be respectful of her and her needs/wants at all times because it was her house and I was grateful for her help. She would just do a dr jackal and Mr hyde everyday about countless things. She would assume something i did or sa8d was always an attack pointed directly at her and I was ‘disrespectful’ if I expressed how I felt attacked. If I tried to set any boundaries at all either her, I was ‘disrespectful’. Like, if you're really drunk, please dont go into the girls room because it makes them uncomfortable. She would also touch them, not in inappropriate places, but just how she would when she was drunk made them uncomfortable. She would also do things like ‘poke by bumhole’ when I would turn over, which made me very uncomfortable. There were so many times that she would say things like, do you talk to your friends or your sponsor about me? What do you say? I would say I'm not going to talk about that, then I was ‘disrespectful’. She only wants people around her she can control and manipulate. She also slings backhanded compliments/insults to anyone that is getting more attention than her, either good or bad. And she thinks she's bring sneaky about it but it's BLARINGLY obvious. She also expects apologies all the time, but she's NEVER in the wrong and never apologizes, unless as a last ditch manipulation tactic. She thinks that because she's my mom ill never cut her off. She was wrong. She drank beer all day everyday starting at 8am but all she really wanted was vodka. I believe that she would start fights in orderyo ensure an excuse to go outabd buy vodka to drink. She did things like roll around on the floor drunk in front of my children, scream horrible things to her husband (he's not exactly a barrel of kittens either) make every single conversation an argument. I can't even listening them all. She's just exhausting. I do want to mention here that when I was 18 and her husband was 38 or 39 he got me drunk and convinced me to sleep with him. I was in the wrong too, but he was the one who pursued. She of course blamed the whole thing on me, and still does to this day. It has been her favorite go to to bring up when I call her out with damping evidence as a way to escape any accountability. She also abandoned us when I was 11, my sister and brother younger, with the excuse of being afraid my dad would kill her. According to her it was a sacrifice foe us to have a better life and she has been martyr about it ever since. I have asked fir two apologies from her, only two. The first was because I asked her to apologize for abandoning us. She said it was my dad's fault and you ask him for an apology. The most recent apology i asked for resulted in me cutting her off. She had not been feeling good when we moved out, so I texted her the next day asking how she was feeling. No reply. Then, I asked her again a couple of days later, no reply. Then, we all got Covid and were sick, which she knew. About a week after that, she called me. Not to ask how her sick grandchildren were, but yo tell me that she feels ‘disrespected and unloved’ by me because I didn't call ir text to check on her. Which i did, actually. I even sent her screen shots of me asking her twice how she was feeling. Her next tactic was to say you never told us, apologized or payed for the hole in the wall we accidentally made. In fact, I did talk to her and her husband about it, apologizing,  offered to to fix it, and offered $100 to fix it. They said, pay it when you can. Then we all got covid. So she said, just apologize for the hole. (Which i already did) but I apologized again anyway. I then asked her to apologize for assuming I didn't care about her, hence the screenshot, but her reply was the nail in our relationship coffin. She said, you should ask your dad for your apology. I knew then that this woman was permanently mentally inept to maintain a rational adult relationship. This whole thing actually fucking sucks because even though my brain tells me I am not responsible for their emotional happiness, self worth etc, my nervous system tells me I am. These are life long emotional manipulative abusive tactics to tell me that I have to fit in the box they made for me. But I don't. All they did was be the physical body that my real father, God used to bring me here. I'm not religious, but spiritual. They say religious people look forward to heaven, but spiritual people have already experienced hell. I will always be sad about this and will always love my parents, but no good comes from having my parents in my life, and it never will. I can accept that and be so grateful every day that my children know what unconditional love truly is. And my husband shows me the same. I am a strong ass woman. I am also very excited right now because my husband and I write music and I have been offered a paying gig to sing our original songs. My future looks bright and I no longer listen to the inner voices they put in my head. Now, I listen to God's.

I'm Michael (Mike), 27 years old, and I live in Germany. I can speak English, German, and Polish (though I don't write well in Polish). I can be a bit reserved at first, but once I get comfortable, I'm all in and pretty much an open book at that point. I value honesty and loyalty, and I'm always trying to grow and improve. I'm pretty lowkey and keep it real.

**A Bit About Me**

* I'm a good listener, and I appreciate both deep conversations and lighthearted banter
* I like calm company—hanging in a voice call while we each do our own thing is underrated
* I'm into solo hobbies, but always open to trying something new if someone brings the spark
* I'm the type who loves to listen and be there for people, but I'll give advice if I can help. Sometimes just being present for someone is what matters most

**Why I'm Posting**

Lately, I've been stuck in my thoughts, and I'm trying to get out of the loop. Finding new friends is one way I think could really help me. I actually have close friends I've known for 12+ years, but they're all on the west coast of the US now, so timezones have been tough since I moved back to Germany. That's part of why I'm looking to connect with people closer to my timezone.

I'm not looking for a big group or server—just hoping to connect with genuine people. I love daily conversations and just checking in on how someone's day went. Whether we're gaming together, watching something, or just chilling on call doing our own thing—I'm flexible and easy going. Whether it's talking about life, vibing in silence, or sending random memes at 2AM—I'm here for it.

I connect best with people who are easy going and non-judgmental. I struggle with self-confidence sometimes, so finding people I really click with can take time, but once I do, I'm all in.

**My Interests**

I'll be honest—most of my hobbies are pretty solo. That's just how I grew up and what I gravitated toward. But I enjoy talking about them and hearing what other people are into.

**Music** has always been important to me. I used to make beats—mostly freestyle, trap, and phonk style—and I might get back into it soon. I'm all over the place with genres:

* Rock / Metal / Metalcore
* Rap / Underground Hip-Hop
* Trance / DnB / Phonk / Hardstyle

Always down to swap playlists or explore new sounds. Got a playlist that hits hard? Send it my way—I'm always listening (coffee gets me through work, energy drinks fuel the late nights).

**Other Stuff I'm Into**

* YouTube deep dives—conspiracy theories, car builds, iceberg videos, paranormal stuff, space content. I like keeping an open mind about these topics
* Binging shows and movies—I'm into old comedies and action films, and I want to get more into horror/scary movies too. Always open to recommendations or watching stuff together
* Just generally falling down rabbit holes. If it's weird or fascinating, I'm in
* Gaming (PC) - I play a mix of tactical shooters, survival games, and RPGs when I want to unwind

**A Bit About My Life**

I work in an office right now—mostly desk work—but I'm looking to get into IT since I know quite a bit about computers. When the weather's nice, I love getting outside and enjoying nature. And there's something about thunderstorms at night—just watching the lightning and chilling—that hits different.

I'm also slowly getting into working out, nothing crazy, just trying to be more active.

I'm a night owl, especially on days off and weekends. During the week when I work, I usually stay up till 11pm-12am. But on nights before my days off? 3-5am is my zone.

And hey, if none of this resonates with you, that's totally fine. I'm always looking to try new things and pick up new interests.

I'm mainly looking for genuine connections and friendships first, but I'm open to seeing where things go naturally if we really click. No pressure, no expectations.

If you're also craving something a little more real than surface-level chats, maybe we're on the same wavelength. Send me a DM or message—timezone differences don't bother me (as long as they're not too extreme), so reach out anytime!",1,1764446917.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I’m a 40-year-old married guy with kids, living in the Boston area. Life is good — I’ve got a great career, a solid family life, and I try to be a respectful, grounded, and dependable person.

What I don’t have enough of is genuine friendship. As an adult, especially with work and family responsibilities, it’s tough to find people to connect with on a real level.

I’m looking to meet other adults (men, women, couples, parents — anyone friendly and genuine) who want real conversation, occasional hangouts, shared interests, or just someone to grab coffee with and talk about life. No drama, no weirdness — just normal, down-to-earth human connection.

My husband is 34 and I'm 29. We've been married for four years. About two months ago my ex messaged me on Instagram asking how I was doing. We dated for three years before I met my husband and it ended pretty amicably, just grew apart type of thing. We started chatting and it felt really good to talk to someone who remembered the old version of me, you know? Before all the responsibilities and mortgage payments and boring married life stuff.

My husband noticed I was on my phone more and asked if everything was okay. I told him I'd been talking to my ex and he got quiet. He asked if maybe I could cool it with the messages and I said he was being insecure and controlling. My ex was just a friend. Why couldn't he trust me?

Here's where I messed up. Our fifth anniversary was coming up and we'd planned this trip to Hawaii. My husband had been looking forward to it for months, showing me snorkeling spots and restaurants. But my ex mentioned he was going to be in the city that same weekend for work and suggested we grab coffee. Just coffee. As friends.

I told my husband two days before the trip that I wasn't feeling well. Migraine, nausea, the works. I said he should go without me, that it was a shame to waste the tickets. He stared at me for a long time and asked, ""Are you sure?"" I nodded. Said I'd feel terrible if he missed out because of me.

He left on a Thursday morning. I helped him pack. Kissed him goodbye. Told him to have fun.

That afternoon I met my ex at a hotel bar downtown. We had drinks. He'd booked a suite at the Ritz for his ""business trip"" and suggested we catch up more comfortably there. I went. I posted a photo of the champagne and city view to my Instagram story. Then another of us at dinner. Then one of the hotel rooftop pool the next morning.

I wasn't thinking about who could see them. My account was public. I was just feeling wanted and exciting and alive again.

Saturday night my ex took me to this exclusive restaurant that requires reservations months in advance. He'd pulled strings. We were drinking wine that cost more than my car payment when my phone started blowing up. My sister. My mom. My coworker. All asking what the hell I was doing.

I ignored them. Posted a story of my ex and me clinking glasses. His hand was on my thigh under the table.

Sunday morning I woke up to 47 missed calls. I finally checked my messages and my sister had sent me a photo. My husband. In a suit. Standing next to my best friend Sarah in a white dress. At a courthouse. The caption on his Instagram read: ""Thanks for the free week. Married the love of my life today.""

I called him immediately. It went to voicemail. I called Sarah. Blocked. I called his mom and she said, ""You have some nerve"" and hung up.

I flew home that afternoon. The house was empty. Half his stuff was gone. There was an envelope on the kitchen table with my name on it. Inside was a letter in his handwriting.

He'd known about the messages. Sarah had told him I'd been planning to meet my ex for weeks because I'd confided in her about it, asked her advice on what to wear. She'd shown him screenshots of our text conversations where I called him boring and said I missed feeling desired. He and Sarah had apparently grown close while I was busy texting my ex. They'd filed for a marriage license three weeks ago.

The Hawaii trip was never about our anniversary. He'd suspected I'd bail to see my ex so he'd planned it as a test. When I canceled, he knew. He went to Hawaii alone, came back Friday, and married Sarah on Saturday while I was posting Instagram stories with another man.

The divorce papers were in the envelope too. Already filed. Irreconcilable differences.

I called my ex in a panic and he said this was getting too complicated, that he didn't realize I was going to blow up my marriage over a weekend fling. He stopped responding to my messages after that.

My family won't talk to me. My mom said I humiliated myself publicly and threw away a good man who loved me. My sister called me selfish. My friends have all sided with my husband and Sarah because apparently everyone knew I was planning to cheat except me, I guess? I don't know. In my head it was just meeting up with an old friend.

I tried to explain to my husband that nothing physical happened with my ex until after he'd already decided to marry Sarah, so technically he cheated first, right? He said planning a wedding and filing paperwork isn't cheating but spending a weekend in hotel rooms with your ex while lying about being sick definitely is.

I don't know. I feel like he set me up. Like this was entrapment or something. And Sarah was supposed to be my best friend. The whole thing feels like they conspired against me.

Was I really that wrong for wanting to feel special again? AITAH?

I just published my first full-length D&D campaign and I feel like I'm going to explode.,"So, I've put about 150 hours into a dark Christmas horror campaign, like, working from 7 AM to 10 PM every day of the week. Listening to sad Christmas instrumentals and drinking peppermint mocha coffee to get me through it.

Saturday... I finally hit publish.  
It's actually out there in the world. People can download it. People can run it. People can *judge* it. I am both excited and internally screaming, hence the explosion. 

It's called When the Bells Fell Silent, and it's this wild mix of:  
\-Christmas spirit as a stat that can literally kill you or give you super powers

\-A 10-hour in-game timer counting down to the death of Christmas

\-Cookie factory death traps (because gotta get that home alone nod in there)

\-A chain smoking Santa locked in a prison

\-A CEO BBEG who literally wants to monetize joy

\-Emotional, gut-punch moments that I'm so proud of, but also so worried about, because what if the table doesn't sob a river?  
\-A reindeer NPC who I'm hoping will lead to a heartbreak that no one can ever forget.

\-LITERAL ART THAT I HAD TO HIRE PEOPLE TO MAKE!

I've NEVER put this much effort into a project before, and I don't think I'm going to ever do less than this again. The high I feel is amazing, but also the anxiety is soul-crushing. 80+ pages, about a dozen handouts and maps, custom magic items, original scenes, all of it.

I don't even know if this post has a purpose other than:  
I'm proud and terrified and happy and nervous and excited and scared and I need to yell about it to a void of fellow TTRPG nerds. 

If anyone else has ever published something on DriveThruRPG (or anywhere), did you also feel like this?  
Did it go away?  
Or do we just... live here now?

Anyway, Merry Crisis, and thanks for listening lol.

1p9y2ch,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAutism/comments/1p9y2ch/how_to_cool_off_a_friendship_with_autistic/,How to cool off a friendship with autistic colleague?,"Hi all. I made friends with a colleague, which I was nervous about doing but we don't work directly with each other and we had so much of our upbringing in common. We hung out solo a handful of times and I introduced her to my small (mostly ND) friend group who she's done a couple day trips with. A year and a half ago it felt like we were becoming close. But little by little it's become clear that she engages in a lot of gossip and drama, and doesn't seem to have any current interests outside of work although she likes going to big  parties and events. All of which I think makes her very fun company to the right person, and as far as she tells me she has plenty of those people in her life. But I am not one of them so my feelings have gone lukewarm. It's been many many months since a conversation with her left room for anything besides her work drama, so to me this has slid back into work-friend/acquaintance territory not friend-friend territory and I'd really like to keep it that way.

Like my other autistic friends, she tends to disappear for lengths of time then reemerge. Which is fine with me, my ADHD time blindness makes that feel pretty inconsequential. But this time around she is acting intensely needy upon reemerging socially. Getting upset if she doesn't get an immediate text back in a group chat with people she barely knows and all have their own social difficulties. She's tried to invite herself on vacations and holidays with me. She's gotten miffed that casual friends and colleagues don't take it upon themselves to reach out after she's socially noped out for months and they don't know her enough to understand why they were ghosted. She and I have talked about this a little, she admits to needing therapy because she feels super lonely despite having more very close longstanding friends than probably most people do. Clearly she's not doing well.

I've declined her multiple requests for Thanksgiving weekend get togethers, but agreed to a coffee next week. I am dreading another hour long rant about the same old drama. It makes me feel like I'm her diary instead of a person. I've been up front from the start that I don't like talking work outside of work, that I struggle to understand and therefore don't like social drama, etc. But that's the incompatibility isn't it. These are her primary interests it turns out, it's not fair of me to expect her to want to talk about something else. The issue is she is acting like she wants to ramp up the friendship despite this, and I don't. 

How can I handle this in a way that is respectful to her? I like her, and don't want to cut her off or anything. She's a good person. I don't want to hurt her feelings or leave her feeling confused by being distant, clearly she's going through enough right now. But I also don't want to lead her on and encourage an emotional intimacy that she seems to feel and I don't. Also, I have been direct so far because we've been friendly. But one of my toxic traits is conflict avoidance, and she seems to be itching for conflict with others lately so I'm nervous about how to proceed.

1p9y29t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p9y29t,CloudMoon: How I Tricked My Ancient Phone Into Playing Modern Games,"Look, I'm not going to pretend I'm some tech wizard who's been following cloud gaming since 2015. I'm just a guy who wanted to play Wuthering Waves without his phone threatening to call the fire department.

# The Tragic Backstory

Picture this: It's 2024, I'm watching YouTube, and some content creator is showing off Wuthering Waves's stunning graphics. I'm thinking ""wow, I should try that!"" Then I check the requirements. 40GB. Forty. My phone has 64GB total, and I'm pretty sure 40GB of that is just screenshots of memes I'll never look at again.

But I'm determined. I delete apps. I delete photos. I delete things I didn't even know I had. Finally, after making sacrifices that would make Marie Kondo nervous, I install the game.

Five minutes of gameplay and my phone is hotter than my laptop during finals week. The battery percentage is dropping like my GPA in college. This isn't gaming—this is thermal torture.

# Enter CloudMoon (Yes, That's Actually What It's Called)

So after googling ""how to play games without my phone exploding,"" I stumbled upon CloudMoon. The concept is pretty simple: instead of your phone trying to cosplay as a gaming PC, CloudMoon's servers do all the heavy lifting. Your phone just streams the game like you're watching Netflix, except you're the one in control.

Basically, your phone goes from being the stressed-out employee doing everything to being the chill manager who just watches and gives orders.

# Why This Actually Works (And I'm Not Just Saying That)

**Storage? What Storage?** CloudMoon needs like 15MB on your phone. That's it. You know what else is 15MB? Probably one of those meme images I mentioned earlier. You can play Genshin Impact, Fortnite, and approximately 47 other games while still keeping your 2,000 photos of your pet.

**My Phone Is From the Stone Age (2020) and It Works** My phone is definitely not flagship material. It was mid-range when I bought it, and now it's basically vintage. But with CloudMoon? I'm playing games that should require a phone from the future. It's like putting racing stripes on a Honda Civic and somehow winning NASCAR.

**No More Hand BBQ** Remember how I mentioned my phone turned into a space heater? Not anymore. Since the actual game runs on CloudMoon's servers, my phone stays cool. I can actually play for more than 10 minutes without needing oven mitts.

**Battery Life Has Entered the Chat** Yes, streaming uses battery. But it's nowhere near as bad as running the actual game. My phone went from ""20 minutes and we're done here"" to ""I can survive a decent gaming session without carrying a power bank everywhere.""

**Zero Download Time (Except the App Itself, Obviously)** No more watching progress bars like they're the most intense sport on Earth. Open CloudMoon, pick a game, and boom—you're playing. Updates? Not your problem. The cloud handles it.

# My Honest Experience (Because Fake Reviews Are Cringe)

I've been using this for a few weeks now, mostly because I'm cheap and wanted free game time without buying a new phone. And honestly? It's pretty solid. I finally got to play Wuthering Waves without my phone staging a rebellion. The graphics are smooth, the gameplay is responsive, and most importantly, I don't have to delete my entire photo library.

Is it perfect? No. You need decent internet—WiFi is your best friend here, though 4G/5G works too. There's occasionally a tiny bit of lag if your connection gets moody, but for most games (especially single-player stuff), it's totally fine.

The free tier exists, and if you actually like it, premium is like $4-5 a month. That's less than >!two coffees. TWO.!< For a month of not needing a $1000 gaming phone.

# Who Is This For?

You should try CloudMoon if:

* Your phone storage looks like a horror movie
* Your phone is older than most trends
* You enjoy games but not third-degree burns
* You're broke but have dreams (relatable)
* You just want to try games without the commitment

# Real Talk

You absolutely need stable internet. If your WiFi is the type that disconnects when someone in the next room breathes wrong, you're gonna have a bad time. And if you're super competitive in online games where every millisecond matters, the slight streaming latency might bother you.

But for everything else? It's genuinely good. I'm not saying it's going to change your life or cure your existential dread, but it'll let you play games on your old phone, and sometimes that's enough.

# Getting Started (It's Really Not That Hard)

CloudMoon works on iOS and Android. Download it, sign up (takes like 2 minutes), and you can try it for free. The interface is simple enough that even my technologically-challenged self figured it out without calling anyone for help.

If you've been stuck watching other people play games because your phone can't handle it, this might be worth a shot. CloudMoon gave me back my first love (gaming), introduced me to my second love (actually functioning technology), and saved my third love (my poor, overworked phone) from an early retirement. It's basically a romantic drama, but with more cloud servers and less crying.

Plus, my phone no longer sounds like it's preparing for takeoff every time I open an app, which is a nice bonus.



*So yeah, that's CloudMoon. Have you tried any free cloud gaming app? Let me know if this actually works for you or if I'm just lucky with my internet.*",1,1764445900.0,cloudgaming,0,0.99,False

1p9y0es,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1p9y0es/aio_or_is_this_a_red_flag/,AIO or is this a red flag,"I am divorced bi-man and have kids who live with me the majority of their week. I was raised in a conservative, religious family and as such never fully embraced my queer side. After separating with my wife, I decided to date strictly men and allow myself a chance to see what it could be like to be in a relationship with a man. I dated for over two years and had the random hook-ups, friends with benefits, and dead end situationships. I found that gay men had a very different meaning of monogamy and commitment than I was used to. There were men who had been in a 20+ year relationships or married to their partners but who were actively seeking sex outside of their relationship. I also found that being a single dad was too much baggage for many guys I was talking to. The dating scene was feeling bleak…..

But that all changed when I met this guy on Grindr, let’s call him Edward. He was younger than myself and gay. We have a ten year age gap but it doesn’t feel like it. We messaged back and forth for a couple months before meeting up for coffee. We immediately hit it off! Edward had always wanted kids but never met a guy he felt comfortable having kids with. He loved the fact that I was a dad, it didn’t bother him at all. We had both recently gotten out of long term relationships where neither of us felt appreciated or supported. The relationship progressed well and my life finally started feeling like everything was falling into place. Having a partner who can support you as much as you support them is life changing. Being loved in all the ways you wanted and even ways you never knew you needed is so fulfilling. 

Edward asked me to be exclusive about a month after we met. I was thrilled and immediately said yes. I waited another 3 months before introducing him to my kids. Initially the kids knew Edward as a close friend and we spent a lot of time together just having them get to know him. As time went on and the kids began to really like Edward being around, we told them that we were more than friends and we were dating. The kids were thrilled and genuinely happy as they really loved Edward. It wasn’t long before I asked Edward to move in and although it seemed fast to everyone outside the relationship, to us it just felt right.  You hear people say, ”when you know you know,” and this is so true. I knew from the first date with Edward that he was someone I could see myself spending the rest of my life with. 

After moving in together, we naturally started spending more time together. I started to notice he was getting DMs from various men. Initially it didn’t bother me but the frequency of these messages was rivaling how much Edward and I messaged each other. That didn’t set well with me. So I asked him about the messages and he assured me that they were friends or colleagues, nothing inappropriate at all. Weeks went by and the messages continued to come at the same frequency. My curiosity began to build and I started asking more questions and recognizing some of the men from the dating apps. They started sending FB messages as well as text messages.  So I began to worry that maybe I wasn’t getting the whole story. I asked Edward again about the messages and got emotional while talking about it. He assured me again and told me, I was safe with him and he would never make me feel insecure in our relationship ship. 

One Sunday morning, Edward was relaxing on the living room couch next to my youngest and I was in the kitchen making breakfast and doing our laundry. It was a pretty typical Sunday. I had invited my niece and her kids over later that day, so after breakfast Edward and I spent some time cleaning up the house. We had a great visit and I was elated that someone from my family was accepting and supportive of us. After my niece left I asked Edward if he could send me the pictures we took with my niece and her kids. He handed me his phone and I selected the photos I wanted to send to myself. The first suggestion Siri gave to send pictures to was a guy on snap. My heart dropped immediately and I didn’t know what to say. I decided to ignore it and carry on with our night. 

However, I couldn’t sleep that night as my mind wouldn’t shut off about these messages.  Edward had obviously been sending pictures to this guy on snap. I decided to check his Snapchat DMs and see what they had been talking about. That’s when everything changed. Their messages were not innocent at all. The other guy was very flirtatious and asking to cuddle with Edward and sent provocative pictures. The pictures weren’t full blown nudes but they left very little to the imagination. Edward flirted back and the banter continued until eventually this guy invited Edward over to his place. Edward stopped messaging after that but that changed nothing. I panicked and realized that Edward had been messaging this guy while relaxing next to my kid this morning. I started thinking back throughout the day trying to remember if he had left at any point, he hadn’t. I looked through the rest of the snap messages and there were multiple men and conversation like this. 

After spending some time searching through his phone, it was clear that these were guys Edward had met on Grindr before we started dating. I also found pictures and videos of intimate moments with past boyfriends or hook-ups saved on his phone. There were multiple text threads with nudes and sexual conversations all of which happened before we were together. I woke up Edward and told him what I found and he said,”it’s nothing, it doesn’t mean anything. That this guy is very playful and gets irritated when I don’t message back.” That wasn’t what I needed to hear and it made me feel even more humiliated. I left the bedroom and slammed the door behind me. 

My mind raced with questions. What does this mean? Can I stay with a man knowing he lied or at least wasn’t honest with me? What will this do to my kids? They have really started relying on Edward for love and support. It wasn’t long before Edward came to find me. He put his hand on my leg and asked if I was ok. I started to cry and told him no. I asked how he knew this guy. He told me they met on Grindr and they had been talking and sending nudes for a while before we met. They had been sexting each other before we became exclusive but had never hooked-up. They actually worked together occasionally and saw each other regularly. Edward said as soon as we became exclusive he stopped being so sexual with his responses and had hoped that would cause this man to loose interest. Well at this point it had been going on for 6 months of our relationship. I asked Edward if he had sex with anyone since we started sleeping together, he said no. He apologized and said he really didn’t think anything about it and that he never meant to hurt me. I felt numb and exhausted. I needed time to think and just went to bed. 

After talking more, I decided to believe Edward and trust him. We set boundaries and Edward agreed that he would keep all conversations strictly professional or friendly. Edward promised me that if this guy couldn’t keep things professional he would ask to stop working with him and delete him from his social media. The messages didn’t come much after that and I slowly began to trust him again. We got closer and eventually went on vacation together. About two months later I noticed a snap notification from the same guy on Edward’s phone. It was a picture on the guy’s private story. He was nude and had all the good parts covered by a sink in the gym bathroom. I felt exactly how I did that night I found out. I talked to Edward about it again and he said he would talk to the guy at work. Before the weekend was over he had received multiple private story updates with similar pictures. So Edward deleted him from his Snapchat. 

We have been dating for over a year now. Edward has definitely shown he is committed to me and my kids. He has changed his life completely helping me take care of the kids needs and the house. We are talking about marriage and I’m so excited with where our relationship is heading. But I’m also scared. It’s clear that Edward has very different boundaries for respecting the relationship than I do. He still more than a dozen of past hook-ups and ex-boyfriends on his social media. Some of these men post very provocative pictures that Edward has reacted to. These men are still very much a part of his life and Edward has “friends” who he has sent nudes to and talked openly about hooking up with before we started dating. Edward insists on keeping the intimate pictures he has from past relationships on his phone. After everything, I find it’s impossible to completely trust Edward. I get triggered whenever he is on his phone or late coming home from work. We talk openly about how I’m feeling and for the most part he is patient and understanding. But I just don’t know if I will ever be able to accept him having friendships like these or keeping his ex’s on social media. The intimate pictures really bother me and I don’t feel like I’m his sole desire. I also don’t feel like my feelings are truly cared for because of Edward tends to defend these guys and down play their interactions. He also watches porn and will check out guys when we are at the gym or out together. He reacts to thirst traps on social media and after everything that has happened, I just don’t feel secure or safe in this relationship. 

Any advice would be appreciated! Have any of you ever been in a similar situation? I truly love this man and can’t imagine not having him in my life. I know Edward loves me and wants to be with me.  It’s just hard for me to feel like I am his sole desire and although it hasn’t happened again, I worry he will start messaging other men again.

I’m a writer who works in a community centre, newly 40, and I’ve been living in Parkdale for the past 14 years. I love reading, walking around the city, coffee, and spending time with my small friendship circle. I also love playing games — anything from board games to video games. I'm 5'8, I wear glasses, I wear a lot of black but not because I'm goth, I'm just a simple man who doesn't care that much about fashion or trends. 

I’m posting here because I’m honestly tired of the apps. They feel so vapid and surface-level, and I’m looking for something deeper than that. I’d really like to meet other gay men who want actual conversation, connection, and friendship — and maybe more if it naturally grows.

Not looking for hookups, not looking to party all the time, and definitely not looking to just stare at a TV in silence. I want to meet people who enjoy thinking, talking, laughing, and being present with each other.

If any of that resonates with you, feel free to reach out. I’m curious if there are others out there who feel the same way.",2,1764445253.0,GayMenToronto,0,1.0,False

1p9xs6m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p9xs6m,"UPDATE #1 - Gifted a Cocoa Pod, So Figured I'd Try to MakeChocolate","This is a follow-up/update from a previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/chocolate/s/7Qhjdga4tT.  I really appreciate the comments, advice, and well wishes from the community. 

Quick recap - I was gifted a cocoa pod and was just planning on showing it around, but ambition got the best of me and decided to try making chocolate from it. I followed the CTAHR method to ferment the beans. I then dried them using a fan for a few days. The beans had a sour, almost vinegar smell on the outside, but on the inside they smelled of cocoa. 

Today I finally roasted the beans. I read about a lot of different time/temps for using a home oven, and decided to do 325 F (163 C) for 5 min, 300 F (149 C) for 5 min, then 250 F (121 C) for 20 min. My goal was to drive off any excess sourness with the high temps, then finish it off at a lower temp so as not to burn it. 

The smell while roasting was awesome. I work for a candy company, and the smell is exactly like I remembered at our cocoa roasting site. Whereas sometimes coffee roasting has almost a burnt smell, cocoa smells very much like baking a chocolate cake or brownies, perhaps a bit stronger. 

Once they were done, I put them on a rack to cool icompletely (I let them sit for 3 hours). I then put them on parchment and crushed them with a rolling pin. They were brittle and crushed easily. I then used a hair dryer with no heat to winnow the nibs (I just shook the bowl as I blew air into it, and the chaff was blown out). The end result is in the last picture. 

From a smell/taste standpoint, the nibs smell of warm cocoa, with a smooth, please to taste with almost no bitterness or sourness. I am truly surprised how well this turned out - better than I could ever imagine. 

My next step is to grind the nibs as finely as possible with a mortar and pestle, then add sugar, whole milk powder, and vanilla. I will then continue grinding this until it’s smooth. I will update everyone again with the final result!

Hi all. For the last few months I'm working on an idea to create an app which connect nearby companion who share similar interest. It's not a dating app. I am positioning it as a booking app where you can sell yourself for your interests. 

A few examples:
1. One fine Sunday evening, if you just want to go for a walk or a coffee, but if you don't want to go alone, you can book a companion of your interests nearby you to go. 
2. If you're skillful in any area like chess, pickle ball, guitar etc., you looking for a companion you can go and book. 
3. It's upto you how you want to sell yourself (skill, interests, travel, fun, or date), but once booking is done people can rate you and give comment about your vibe. 
4. Additionally, you can chat and share your meeting photos in the gallery section. 

Hourly rates depend anywhere between 49-999 depends on your booking preference. 

I want to test and validate this idea with real people. Any suggestions from you is welcome. ",2,1764445020.0,BangaloreSocial,4,0.75,False

Amid the turmoil of existence there are achievements that appear impressive in pictures and setbacks that remain unspoken. Every day progresses with victories such, as meeting a deadline or catching up with a friend.. At night when darkness falls and silence prevails a particular void rests beside my bed. A chair has always occupied that spot. I never chose it. Arranged its place but it somehow fits there.

On evenings it’s simple to overlook. I immerse myself in my phone flitting between chats. Let time slip by unnoticed. Occasionally when rest evades me and my thoughts race the chair appears very near. It remains silent providing neither solace nor critique. At times it seems to contain forms from days such as hopes left unachieved or facets of myself encountered only in fantasies. At moments it is merely a quiet area, within a space that is otherwise noisy.

The chair never reveals its name to me. Perhaps I would label it as solitude or unease or simply uncertainty. Its sole function is to occupy space. It remains the spot, in my existence that neither feigns nor insists that doesn’t require mending or explanation. After days I occasionally catch myself seated there without any clear reason legs drawn in tuning into silence. In those moments I realize the chair isn’t an issue. It is merely space. It is genuine not requiring me to become anything.

Over time I believe everyone acquires a chair, like this. Some attempt to conceal it beneath garments. Others switch rooms. Relocate to different cities wishing it won't follow.. It does, settling silently in the corner regardless of where you land.

One morning I may cease moving. Simply sit with it. I brew some coffee. Observe how the light hits its armrest. In that stillness the chair seems vacant. Perhaps it even seems like a companion. Silent,. Now it feels familiar. It’s simply waiting for me to embrace all the emptiness, within me.

Maybe what felt like emptiness was always an invitation. The chair remains, the most loyal thing in the room, waiting to be claimed.",1,1764444855.0,TwentiesIndia,4,1.0,False

Hey expats, digital nomads, and anyone who's ever wanted to throw their phone at a Google Voice verification screen — I get it. That old Grand Central → Google Voice number used to be perfect: US taxes, banking, 2FA, everything running through one free number... until Google decided ""actually, you need a real US number to keep this working."" And when that GV number is already all over your IRS paperwork? Losing it feels like setting your Social Security card on fire. You're definitely not alone — this is literally the #1 headache in r/expats and r/digitalnomad right now.

I'm a mod here and also build an app that sells one-time US numbers for verifications (WhatsApp, Telegram, GV, whatever you need), so I've helped hundreds of people solve this exact problem. Here's what actually works in 2025.

# Quick ways to get back into your Google Voice today

* **Burner / Hushed** – $4–6/month, instant US number
* **TextNow / TextPlus** – free with ads (or $10/year ad-free), works over WiFi anywhere in the world
* **Our app** – pay-per-SMS disposable US numbers (more details below)

# Ways to get a US number for receiving verification codes (2025 edition)

# 1. Buy a physical/prepaid US number (the ""official"" route)

**Providers:** Tello, US Mobile, Mint Mobile, Google Fi (eSIM)  
**Cost:** $10–30 upfront + $5–10/month  
**Pros:** Looks 100% legit to the IRS and banks; easy to port into Google Voice permanently.

**2025 bonus:** Tello and US Mobile now let you activate eSIM completely online from anywhere — you don't even need a US address for the eSIM itself. Need a physical SIM? Ship it to a friend or use a mail forwarder like MyUS or Shipito.

# 2. Buy a permanent virtual (VoIP) US number

**Top picks:** Zadarma, CallHippo, Grasshopper, RingCentral  
**Cost:** $5–15/month  
**Pros:** Instant setup, pick any area code you want, SMS + calls forwarded to your phone/email/Telegram.

**IRS acceptance:** Yes, totally fine in 2025 — as long as it's a US-originated number, they don't care if it's VoIP. Thousands of expats use Zadarma for taxes with zero issues.

# 3. Buy a temporary US number – only pay when the SMS actually arrives

**Our mobile app** (iOS/Android, works worldwide)

**How it works:** Open the app → pick ""United States"" → rent the number for 5–20 minutes → Google sends you the code → you're done.

**Cost:** Usually $0.40–$1.80 per successful SMS (depends on current demand)

**Pros:** Cheaper than a coffee, no subscription, no extra numbers cluttering up your phone. Perfect for your exact situation: use it once to reclaim your legacy GV number, then port the old one back in ($20 port fee, totally worth it).

# My personal recommendation as an expat dev

**Step 1:** Grab a temp US number from our app → verify → breathe again.

**Step 2:** For long-term IRS peace of mind, add a Tello eSIM or Zadarma virtual as your ""official"" contact and update it on the IRS website (takes like 60 seconds).

Where are you based right now — Europe, Southeast Asia, Latin America? Drop it in the comments and I'll tell you the cheapest/fastest option for your country.

Myy dream is to have my own business one day. Working for someone else, having people boss me around, following rules that aren’t mine… it just doesn’t feel like the life I’m meant for.

What really messes with me is how everyone talks about “accomplishing things” and how they feel useless if they’re not achieving or climbing the ladder. I don’t feel that at all. I don’t care about accomplishments. I don’t want promotions. I don’t want a fancy title. I’m a hard worker, my appraisals are good, but I have zero desire for any of that.

Work just drains me. I go home exhausted, weekends I’m too tired to do anything, and my whole life is work-home-repeat. I dream about having slow mornings, sitting in a coffee shop reading, going out at night without worrying about waking up early. But working feels like it’s sucking the life out of me.

1p9xjt3,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1p9xjt3/shapeshifter/,Shapeshifter,"The sky grew dark as the clock drew closer and closer to midnight. It was a starry night that night in the countryside, tiny white dots that sparkled even through tinted windows. Bryan checked the clock on his dash. 11:13. He supposed that about now would be a good time to stop for a bite to eat. He glanced at the GPS stuck in front of the middle of the dash searching for when the next truckstop would be.“In Ninety-Four Miles, Take A Right!” chimed the dull, mechanized voice playing from the speakers. 


Bryan let out a light chuckle finding a sort of dry humor in his unfortunate circumstances. “The lack of sleep is getting to me.” he thought, pushing some buttons on the GPS. He gave up on the truckstop the moment he heard the distance, opting for a convenience store or a gas station instead. He hadn’t eaten in hours and judging by the looks of the now quarter-tank of diesel, he was going to need a lot more fuel if he wanted to make it to that truckstop in the first place.


“In Four Miles Take A Left, And On The Next Right, You Will Have Arrived At Your Destination!” Bryan smiled at this, knowing food and fuel was only a small drive away. Ninety-Four? He could hardly stomach the idea of driving another ten. He took a sip of his now lukewarm coffee growing angst from driving for so long. He pressed a little harder on the gas than usual, now going about six over the limit as the trees grew thicker and thicker on both sides of him.


When he arrived at the gas station, he looked up at the sign above. “M.T Wilakers Gas Station & Grill”. Bryan made his way to the side of the truck and towards the fuel pump, grabbed the nozzle and shoved it into the fuel door before making his way inside. The fluorescent lights hummed above him, his tired eyes keeping eye contact with the floor, analyzing the cracks and streak marks present on the white and red checkered tiles.


His number one priority was finding the coffee machine, grabbing a cup and filling it to the brim with the steaming hot liquid caffeine. Waiting patiently for the cup to fill he couldn't help but notice the stack of newspapers just to his right. “Seven Missing In One Month” boldly printed on the top of the page. It continued “Since the start of July continuing into the first few days of August, at least seven people have gone missing around Talladega National Forest and have not been seen since, including the likes of 16 year old Bennett Shoultz, 38 year old Christopher Matches, and 11 year old Sussana Richards.” 


“Sick bastard.” Bryan thought to himself. “What godless freak steals a child?” “As of now, search parties sent on multiple occasions to look for the missing people continue to return empty handed.” His reading was suddenly interrupted by a loud *ding* coming from the coffee maker, letting him know that his coffee was done pouring. He made his way to the register being sure to pick out his typical two course meal of jerky sticks and peanuts. As much as he didn’t like it, he knew it was cheap especially after new management got involved and informed him he couldn’t purchase his food on the company dime anymore. And with that he paid for his “meal”, made his way out to the truck and sped off into the night towards Winterboro.


Even as he sipped on his hot coffee Bryan could feel how great of a drag the job had become, the monotony of the many highways he had been driving up and down since five o’ clock that morning. Since almost two years ago now. He loved taking his old pickup backroading, music blaring through the stereo speakers, there was truly nothing like it. He thought being a semi-driver would be at least some-what thrilling. It may have put money in his wallet but he never shied away from the fact that he hated the road, despised it even. He said as much to any and all who had cared to lend him a listening ear. “Don’t even get me started on the interstate.” he’d tell them.


His truck quickly climbing up to the speed limit, Bryan reached over to the passenger side to retrieve one of the jerky sticks he had purchased. The packaging had been less lenient than usual. He had trouble trying to open it even with his teeth. If he was going to get it open without veering off the road he was going to have to pull over. The semi squealed to a halt as he pulled off into a large enough clearing for his truck to enter, allowing the two or three cars behind him to pass by. 


Finally managing to rip the packaging open, he took a bite of the stick in his hand. It tasted funny, not exactly rancid but more old and more dry than usual. Like if musty moved on from a scent and became a taste. It was just enough to allow his appetite to fail him. “God damnit.” he cursed in between chews, quickly spitting the contents of his mouth into a napkin before tossing it into the paper bag he had taken out with him. He reached over for the other jerky stick hoping for better luck, but before he could open it that's when he noticed it. Someone standing in the middle of the road.


The shape of a little girl just off to the side of the trucker's headlights. She couldn't have been older than ten or eleven. From what could be seen of her, Bryan could at least make out that she had messy blonde hair. She wore a light purple shirt with a colorful cartoon character on the front of it. She also wore what looked to be cargo shorts, which a small patch of the left leg had been torn. Bryan's eyes adjusted to what he was seeing slowly, and from what he could see the girl couldn't look much worse for wear. 


 The girls clothes were filthy and covered in what looked to be dirt or mud. She was bleeding with cuts and scratches all over her arms and legs, as if she had been sprinting through the thick forest, not caring what branches, bushes or thorns would cut into her. Her feet were filthy, covered in mud and pine needles and one of her shoes was missing. Bryan could just barely make out her face in the darkness. She was shaking. A teary-eyed look of fear and panic almost fully obscured by a veil of inky blackness. As she continued to stare at the large semi, a thought clicked for Bryan.


“Is this that missing girl from the paper?” Bryan thought, quickly making an effort to roll down his window and peering his head out just a little bit to make his voice more clear and easier to hear. “Do you need help?!” he called out, but before he could even finish talking the girl turned around sprinting to the other side of the road and past the tree line. Bryan's immediate thought was that he had accidentally scared the poor girl. And so he turned on his hazard lights, grabbed his flashlight from the door, and climbed out of the semi before locking it. 
                  

 “Wait, come back!” Bryan yelled after her, trying to follow where she had gone. Bryan made a point to look behind him to check how far from the truck he was, almost alarmed to see that even at the short distance he had trudged past the treeline the hazard lights were barely visible. Keeping a brave face determined to help the girl he continued farther. His flashlight illuminated on the bushes and trees ahead, casting deformed and almost evil looking shadows on anything behind them. Outstretched branches forming like skeletal hands ready to reach out and grab him. Ready to grab either of them.


Then he saw her again many yards away. She looked back for only a moment before forcing her way past more of the thick flora. “I’m not trying to hurt you!” he shouted. “I promise, I can take you back to town, I can get you to a doctor or even a hospital. They can help you find your parents, they're probably worried sick about you!” He kept on, the sticks, leaves and thorn bushes crunching under his boots, making his way towards the brush she had disappeared into. More scrapes came to his arms while trying to move forward, some broke skin and began to bleed but he kept going. 

He looked back to the road, or at the very least where he believed the road to be. The truck's lights were no longer visible from where he stood. They were so obscured by the surrounding forest that they were blotted out entirely. The deeper he ventured into the woods, the thicker the flora became, and with it the shadows had grown to a borderline oppressive degree. He could hardly see the stars anymore, the trees were so tall and the branches so long and full with pine that you could have sworn the very tops of the trees could touch the sky.


Bryan slowly waved his light back and forth looking for any sign of where the little girl had gone, and that's when he saw it. A bloody scrap of the girl's shirt torn off and stuck on a sharp branch. He quickly made his way over, examining the small piece of cloth and trying to use it to find out where the girl had gone. He heard a short but clear rustling sound from the foot of the hill below him, shining his light at where he had heard it, seeing movement as a small bunch of shrubs swayed back and forth.


Slowly he positioned his body sideways inching his way down the steep hill so as to keep from falling. He noticed that it was becoming much more humid the closer he had gotten to the bottom of the hill, making him sweat as the humidity and his trek through the thick woods was starting to catch up to him. Finally getting to the bottom he made his way through the shrubs. It was a pond. Too small to be a lake, the pond couldn't have been deeper than seven feet? 


There were no trees or thorn bushes surrounding it. Tall grass poked up from the corners of the pond, soft green patches of moss and algae sat floating atop the pond's surface. A stark contrast to what he had been trying to navigate through but a welcome change nonetheless. The momentary peace was cut short by the surface of the water breaking and the sounds of someone thrashing violently in the middle of the pond. He swung his light in the direction of the sudden sound. It was the girl. She was drowning.


Bryan found himself almost sprinting towards the edge of the pond, he didn't know what else to do.“She went out farther than she could manage” he thought. “Was she trying to use the pond to hide from me? Was it my fault this girl was about to drown?” He knew he could save her, he didn't want this little girl's death on his conscience. Bryan’s boot hit the shallow with a loud splash, he immediately began to move, almost fighting against the pond's soft and muddy floor. As his feet disrupted the water, he couldn't help but notice the putrid smell that was kicked up from it. Like the nauseating smell of hot garbage, but mixed with the sickly sweet smell of rotting fruit.


The little girl continued to thrash, straining for every last breath of air. Bryan trudged through the mud as fast as he could, calling out reassurance that he would help her, keeping his flashlight trained exclusively on her. The water was waist deep where he stood, the mud becoming so viscous that he practically had to march to keep from getting stuck. Suddenly his foot hit something solid, causing Bryan to stumble and drop the flashlight.


“Shit!” he thought. He held his breath, trying to reach his light, closing his eyes and practically praying to God that he wouldn’t make a mistake. Feeling around through the mud he finally found it, grasping the light with a death grip. Pulling himself out of the water the smell wafted out stronger than it had been before. He rubbed the water out of his eyes so that he could see, and then he realized. It was quiet. 


 No splashing, fighting or anything. He began fearing the worst as right when he needed it most, his light flickered and died out. He began shaking his flashlight, then hitting it, doing everything he could to try to make it work, for the beam to cut through the darkness and provide him safety once again. Finally, the light flickered back on illuminating the surface and all that resides beneath, illuminating what he had tripped on moments before.


Bryan took one look and screamed in terror. A face. Peering out of the mud from the bottom of the pond. It starred up at the night sky, the face frozen in a look of horror. Bryan began to step back, shining his light at the terrifying display at his feet. Multiple human faces sticking out of the mud. Some were fresh with long cuts across the face. Others were already rotting with pieces or even chunks of their face and neck missing. Each one displaying a blood freezing look of shock, pain or fear. There had to be at least eight or maybe nine bodies that Bryan could see. A shallow graveyard just beneath the surface.


For only a moment, Bryan had forgotten about why he had been standing in the middle of that pond in the first place. Until he heard a new sound coming from just a few feet in front of him. It sounded like a wet gurgling noise, like water trickling down the drain after using the disposal. Bryan slowly raised his arm to point his light at whoever or whatever was making the noise. There in the center of the pond fully lit by the flashlight in his hand was the girl, which could now be seen in full, petrifying display. Her clothes were covered in what Bryan could now see was never mud, but bloodstains, dark red spots and blotches covering the girls' torn up clothes in a sort of macabre tie-dye pattern. 


The cuts on her arms oozed profusely, but it wasn't blood. A runny, inky black substance ran down her arms, dripping off her fingers. Worse was her face. Her eyes were open as wide as could be, completely white and glazed over. More of the black substance ran down her face, revealing to the terrified trucker the large bleeding gash from her scalp. Her jaw hung wide open, revealing a mouth of broken, missing teeth. She was shaking much more violently then she had before as the gurgle got louder and more guttural.


Bryan couldn't move, he could barely even breathe watching the girl's small frame as it suddenly began to grow. No, she wasn't growing, something inside of her was. Her skin began to stretch and strain as whatever was inside her grew larger and larger. The black fluid that seeped from her wounds was now freely flowing out, practically spraying out of her limbs. Her purple and red clothes were soaked through with a charcoal black, the water surrounding her was tainted dark as the void and she began to bloat. Shaking with fear he watched as her face began to stretch creating an uncanny face full of fear and pain. The fluid gushed from her mouth and nostrils and sprayed out of the cuts in her throat. Finally the strain had proven too much and the skin burst open with a sickening pop.


Black water splattered across the pond in all directions, the surface of the water tainted by the oily fluid. It covered Bryan's face getting into his eyes and even his mouth, the vile and taste of the black substance causing him to wretch. He was broken from his fearful trance by the rotten taste of the liquid only to once again be paralyzed by the new sound that filled his ears. It erupted from in front of him right where the bloated skin once stood. It sounded like a chorus of people screaming out in pain all coming together to make a single uniform cry to get away from here as fast as he could. Within there was something else, the throaty, earsplitting roar of something massive. Something unhuman. 


Bryan couldn’t see, he could only listen to the horrifying scene before his ears. His body was now in autopilot as he felt his legs move on their own and his body lurch in the opposite direction to start away from where the noise had come from and away from the thing that made it. He couldn’t see what it looked like nor did he want to know. The horror of his situation was realized as he heard splashing from behind him as he fled. He could feel the soil beneath his feet shake and vibrate as his pursuer took one step after another.  


The creature behind him was getting closer and closer, Bryan continued to march and swim as fast as he could not caring what direction he was going or if he would be lost. He only cared about getting away from this place, getting away from the monster behind him. As Bryan felt the water around him get more and more shallow he felt a clawed, scaly hand grab him by the leg. The hand was so large the fingers practically wrapped around the entire shin. Bryan panicked and started kicking trying to break free only for its grip to get tighter, its sharp claws digging into his skin. The beast violently dragged the terrified trucker back into the water as he tried fruitlessly to grab hold of anything that might give him a fighting chance.

 
Bryan tried to open his eyes and they stung as his eyelids briefly fluttered open. Through panicked and rapid breaths he took as deep of a breath as he could before his head dipped below the surface. Just as the creature let go of his leg, he felt another large hand press into his back. He was pinned to the bottom of the pond and could do nothing as a massive set of jagged teeth sank deep into his shoulder. The pain caused him to cry out and lose what oxygen he had left. He felt the weight of the massive monster shift above him as its jaws let go, only to sink back down even deeper. The pain was unbearable, yet he could feel his body going numb.


He couldn't see. He couldn't hear. He couldn't breathe. 
He couldn't even feel. The last thing he tasted was the terrible rotten taste of the black fluid mixed with the metallic taste of his own blood.

The full moon rose high up in the night sky. It was a still night with not a gust of wind to disturb the peace. Aside from the chirping of insects and the crunching of twigs and grass beneath the animals feet it was almost completely quiet. The near silence was broken by an old, rusty car that revved and wound its way over the dusty backroads of the countryside. Ava gripped the steering wheel so hard you’d think she was trying to bend the aluminum. She had missed her turn an hour ago. She had no way of knowing sooner because it had been her first time out that far. Her written instructions to get to her friend's party were useless to her now and she had no map that would help her.


“Come on, stay with me! Please?” She pleaded with the dying vehicle, her anxiety reaching highs she’d never felt before as the engine ticked and sputtered. She had little gas left in the can and she cursed and swore at herself for not thinking to get more before she left. Of course she didn't think she would need it. She never even thought she would be here. Her car violently shook as it ran over a bumpy patch of rocks embedded into the dirt road. Her car was doing terribly before, not like she could afford to make it better, but the rock patch served as a final nail in the engine's coffin. 


What little life was left in the small Mazda had been violently rattled out of it and she practically felt it flatlining as she was forced to veer onto the shoulder of the road. She didn’t even bother taking the key out of the ignition when it died. She took a deep breath before letting out a long frustrated sigh that rose into a furious yell. “Damn this busted up piece of shit!” Ava shouted, storming out of the now useless vehicle and slamming the door on her way out. 


She fumbled around her jacket pocket for a cigarette, brushing her dark brown hair out of her face as she brought the butt to her lips and lit it. The smoke worked to take the edge off but only for a moment as the reality of how helpless she was began to weigh on her like a stack of bricks. She was ready to cry. She was trapped in the middle of nowhere with no way of getting out.


She hadn’t seen a house for miles or at least she hadn’t seen one that she trusted. Her cell phone was dead and she had no spare battery. As far as her parents knew she was staying the night at her friend Emily’s house. As far as Emily and her friends might think",2,1764444626.0,scarystories,1,1.0,False

1p9xbfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/llivo/comments/1p9xbfg/holiday_hosting_tips_to_delight_every_seasonal/,Holiday Hosting Tips to Delight Every Seasonal Traveler,"# 

The **holiday season** carries a feeling that doesn’t quite exist at any other time of year. Airports are crowded, families are gathering, the weather is colder, and travelers are moving with a mix of excitement, nostalgia, and emotional weight. And when someone books your place during the holidays, they’re not just booking a bed — they’re hoping for comfort, relief, and maybe even a little magic.

This is where **Llivo hosts** shine. At [**Llivo**](https://www.llivo.com/), hosting isn’t about transactional stays. It’s about making people feel welcomed, cared for, and understood — especially during a season when emotions can run high. Llivo’s mission, as shared in the Story of Llivo, reminds us that hospitality begins with humanity. The holidays are the perfect time to embody that philosophy.

Below are simple, warm, and thoughtful holiday hosting ideas that aren’t about perfection — but about presence. These are the gestures and habits that help seasonal travelers feel grounded the moment they arrive.

https://preview.redd.it/l5mzqvk8x84g1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cf38408800a980884590b34944120aee109c8d8

# 1. Send a Warm Pre-Arrival Note

Holiday travel is unpredictable. Delays, weather issues, long lines… people arrive drained. A small message from you a day before check-in feels surprisingly reassuring:

“Safe travels tomorrow! If you need anything on your way, just text me. Wishing you a peaceful holiday season.”

It sounds simple, but travelers often read it twice.

It reminds them that someone is waiting for them — not a company, but *a person*.

Communicating warmly is one of Llivo’s strongest values. Learn more in:  
 Relationship with Renters



# 2. Offer a Smooth, Stress-Free Arrival (Pickup if Possible) 

The most stressful part of holiday travel is *getting there*. If you can offer airport pickup — even occasionally — it transforms the entire experience. If not, sending a clear rideshare or transit guide helps more than you know.

Guests appreciate when you:

* Send one screenshot of the pickup location
* Share real-time traffic advice
* Offer early guidance (“Weather looks rough tomorrow — message me if delayed”)

Holiday airport chaos is real. Your guidance becomes an anchor.

# 3. Add One Simple Holiday Touch (Not a Full Decoration Setup)

You don’t need a Pinterest-perfect living room. Holiday travelers appreciate the *feeling*, not the spectacle. Just one warm touch can shift their mood:

* A tiny ornament
* A winter candle
* A handwritten “Happy Holidays” card
* A small bowl of chocolates
* A cozy blanket by the couch

These gestures whisper, “You’re welcome here,” which is a message holiday travelers deeply appreciate — sometimes more than they admit.



# 4. Create a Space That Feels Warm, Calm, and Lived-In

The holidays can be intense — even joyful intensity can tire people out. When they enter your space, they want quiet and calm.

You can create that by:

* Using warm lighting instead of harsh overhead bulbs
* Adding a soft throw on the bed
* Keeping clutter minimal
* Making sure the temperature is perfectly comfortable upon arrival

This doesn’t require money. It requires intention.

Thoughtful hosting is explained beautifully in:  
 Policies and Best Practices



# 5. Share a Few Local Holiday Tips (Just a Few!)

Travelers staying during the winter holidays don’t want long lists. They want **helpful, real insights**.

Examples:

* “This bakery has the best warm apple pie in our town.”
* “There’s a holiday market two blocks away — worth a walk.”
* “The local coffee shop opens early on Christmas morning.”

Remember: during the holidays, guests aren’t just exploring — they’re seeking comfort. Your suggestions become part of their story.



# 6. Provide a Fully Stocked, Easy-to-Use Kitchen

Winter travel often includes cooking, baking, or warming food. Even if the guest isn’t hosting a holiday dinner, they’ll appreciate:

* Basic spices
* Olive oil
* Tea and coffee
* A clean kettle
* A microwave that’s easy to use
* Clear labels on cabinets

These small comforts help guests feel less like visitors and more like temporary locals — which is one of the most beautiful parts of holiday travel.



# 7. Consider a Flexible Check-In or Check-Out Window

Holiday flights get delayed. Plans change. People are juggling families, dinners, weather, and emotions. If you can offer even 30 minutes of flexibility, it often becomes the most appreciated part of their stay.

Guests won’t always thank you in writing,  
but they will feel the difference.



# 8. Be Present Without Intruding

Some holiday travelers are celebrating. Some are grieving. Some are exhausted. Some just need a peaceful escape.

Your tone, your responses, and your availability matter more during this season than any other.

The best hosts:

* Respond quickly
* Stay warm
* Respect privacy
* Offer help without hovering

Human presence without pressure — that’s the true holiday magic.



# Final Words

Holiday hosting isn’t about decorations or fancy amenities. It’s about understanding the emotional journey of the traveler — the fatigue, the joy, the nostalgia, the stress, the hope. When you offer warmth, clarity, and small comforts, you give guests more than a place to stay. You help them feel grounded during one of the busiest times of the year.

This is exactly what **Llivo** was created for — to restore the human side of hospitality, to remind hosts that kindness is a powerful business strategy, and to help travelers feel at home even when they’re far from the people they love.

As a Llivo host, you can give them that with ease

I’m a truly hopeless romantic. Give me cliché stuff, gentle romance, quiet nights, cute dates, sharing life with my person, making memories, all that classic relationship stuff. But here comes the tricky bit: I’m asexual. Meaning I’m not up for anything sexual, *ever*. Which, to no surprise, has made my love life a bit challenging. I said this is a shot in the dark, didn’t I?

I offer dry humour, teasing as a love language, random info dumps and loads of cuddles. Needless to say, I’d love a partner who accepts my boundaries and is happy without any bedroom activities, so someone with a very low drive, or maybe I’ll strike it lucky and you’re ace too! **So, in a nutshell**, I’m looking for a monogamous long term relationship. Easier said than done, being ace, but never say never!

Now, since lists are clear and effective, have some!

**Who I am:**

* 27 years old and from Finland
* atheist and progressive person (liberal, leftie, woke, you get it)
* childfree
* chubby and short, short dark hair (but it changes, it’s been blue, purple, red…)
* some small tattoos but I dream of a full sleeve
* don’t smoke or drink at all, my only vice is coke zero
* city girl, love culture, museums, theatre, musicals, coffee shops, shopping etc.
* into writing, reading, photography, fashion, city holidays, binging tv shows
* not nerdy but not sporty either
* sadly very allergic to pets

**Who I’m looking for:**

* around my age, and please be 25 or older
* located in Europe
* doesn't want children
* knows what he wants, emotionally intelligent, honest, humorous
* someone I can have deep conversations with but also goof around

**Dealbreakers/ Big NOs for me:**

* sexism, homophobia, transphobia, racism, bigotry in general
* drugs, smoking, drinking a lot

I hope you’re having a cozy, calm, or at least slightly sweet kind of day. I’m reaching out with an open heart, looking for a cuddle buddy and maybe a new friend here in the Netherlands. ideally near Amsterdam or within 30 mins commuting!

A little about me:

• I'm 35 years old guy working as an executive and happily calling Amsterdam home for over 3 years now.
• I live alone, take care of myself, and try to stay fit, but also never say no to dessert.
• I’d be happy to host or come to you, whatever makes you feel safe and comfortable.
• I love being outside, especially in the summer… picnics, strolls, a lazy lunch on a sunny terrace… simple things, really.
• Traveling is a big part of my life and dream. I’d love to see the whole world, one new place (and snack) at a time.
• I’m a good listener. My friends often say I make them feel calm and heard. You’ll get lots of warm, respectful hugs and cozy company if that’s what you need 🤗
• Cleanliness and kindness go hand in hand for me. I value both deeply.
• I'm 183 cm tall, 80 kg, have broad shoulders, little muscular, tanned skin, black hair, brown eyes.

What I’m looking for:

Someone to share gentle and genuine connection with. Whether that’s cuddling up on the couch, sharing a quiet moment over coffee, or just chatting about our days.

I’m also open to making new friends… movie nights, cooking together, mini-adventures nearby… whatever brings joy without pressure.

And of course, if you’d prefer to meet in a public space first, that’s absolutely fine. Your comfort always comes first.

So if you’re someone who values kindness, closeness, and maybe the occasional silly laugh. I’d really love to hear from you. 💛

Let’s make a little space in this busy world for warmth and connection.

I have tried 3 different beans, multiple different grind levels, used a naked portafilter to analyze the shot, yet my shots are disgustingly bitter and completely undrinkable. 

1. Heat up the double shot dual-wall portafilter
2. Grind 0.5oz (16g) at level 6 using Baratza Encore grinder and Lavazza Super Crema medium roast bean
3. Use coffee distribution tool and spring-loaded tamper
4. Brew a double shot, which takes about 12 seconds to start (counted from when I start to hear the machine running, not from the time I push the button)

This yields only 0.6oz of of very bitter coffee. There is only a thin layer of crema. When I use the naked portafilter, it looks good. But maybe using a dual wall basket requires a different set up? Although using a non-dual wall basket still tastes awful. When I grind at level 4, almost no coffee comes out. 

Help! Am I ever going to pull a shot that tastes as good as expensive Nespresso shots?

**I [27 M] am concerned that my semi-girlfriend [23 F] of a couple of months is with me for my celebrity status. I've worried about this in the past.**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/muphClGit6)  **Nov 30, 2014**

This is obviously a throwaway for good reason. Without going into much detail, I am an actor on a sitcom and have been for a few years. I am a supporting actor and most of you would not know my name but many would be familiar with my character. I'm certainly far from a ""big deal."" I am not famous enough to be followed by paparazzi (thankfully) but am recognized regularly on the streets. I do fine financially, but I'm not Brad Pitt (I wish!), and I don't live a very high profile celebrity lifestyle. I'm happy just staying in on the weekend. 

I recently met someone at a coffee shop. I sat next to her and we started chatting. She was down to earth and when she asked what I did, I told her I did some acting. Nothing uncommon around these parts. She didn't seem to recognize me, and I didn't go into more detail. I got her number and we texted a few times. Then we met for lunch and she said something that made it clear she recognized me. 

We've hung out since then several times. She wanted to introduce me to one of her friends who is a ""killer fan"" of the show. That had me nervous! Apparently, she is just a big fan. I didn't really like to be paraded in that way, but it was fine. That's part of my job to some extent. 

The thing that is getting to me is that she often refers to me as though I am my character. For example, I might say something sarcastic and she'll say ""okay [character]."" I'm not on Facebook, but one of my friends is and he friended her. He showed me her page and she wrote, a few months ago, ""OMG, I met [my name]. I think he is into me. #celebgirlfriend""  Use of hashtags on Facebook aside, it started making me think she was into me from my character or to show off and not into me.

This is obviously a problem in my life. I have dated two actresses, neither of who are all that famous. Both had their sights on ""bigger things."" I know for a fact that at least one was using me as a way to get her name out there. It worked. I'm very happy for her. Otherwise, I am attracted to students, bartenders, baristas, etc. I tend to date around, rarely in serious relationships because I am concerned that they don't like me for me. 

I play a very extroverted, confident character, but that isn't me in real life. My self-esteem is fine, but I guess I'm a bit paranoid. I feel like this girl likes me, but would she if I wasn't a minor celebrity? 

Is there some way to know? Am I doomed to dating within the industry? Do most people realize that who were are as characters is not really how we are as people? Any advice is appreciated.

Oh, and yes, I am a regular redditor. I lurk on this sub a lot, and I appreciate the advice of those not in the industry. Thank you.

**Edit**Just to clarify, she doesn't call me by my character's name. She does talk about my character as if it is another person, but she then compares me to him. I really appreciate everything I've read so far even if I don't directly respond to it.

>>Thanks. I don't know if I'd say immature, but I could see why you would say that. When we are together we tend to have excellent conversations. She is beautiful, has a good head on her shoulders, and is very understanding of my work schedule. We haven't had the talk about being exclusive, but as far as I am concerned we are. So, yeah, it's pretty good. I feel like this is more my problem than anything she is doing, overall, but I don't know how to approach it with her without sounding like I am accusing her of something.

> As a non-famous redditor, this is somewhat outside of my wheelhouse, but I don't really think this is totally unique to the show business world. Personally, as a lawyer (just starting out and not rich/notable by any means but still), I definitely get the feeling that women are interested in me for the wrong (e.g. financial/status) reasons sometimes. I haven't really figured out how to deal with it either, but I'd say you should trust your instincts if you think she's using you.
>
> ""Otherwise, I am attracted to students, bartenders, baristas, etc.""
>
> That said, I think this is the problem really; these are probably the last types of people you want to date. You need to find someone who is more established in a legit career (so you're more or less equals) and who isn't interested in ingratiating herself into the world of showbiz.

>> I saw someone else just wrote that I ""date down."" I understand that, but not too many years ago I was a student and barista. I grew up in a small town. I think being a lawyer is something you earned through your education, etc.

**FL2PC7TLE**

> I live in West Hollywood, so I have seen a lot of this. I think the key is time: simply getting to know her better, and her getting to know you better. If she is in the industry and using you, you are already learning how to recognize this.

> But if she is not in the industry and just a little dazzled and excited, I wouldn't take this as a deathblow. She's young, and our culture has become really obsessed by this sort of thing. As she gets to know you, it will gradually become obvious whether she likes the real you or not.
>
> What you are asking for, if you think about it, is what we ALL want: a guarantee. Does s/he really like ME, or just... my looks/ my money/ my status/ the fantasy in his/her head... you don't have to be a celebrity to worry if the person you are with is really seeing you clearly. We all struggle with this. Your situation just has a more easily identifiable element to it.
>
> But this is why celebrities hook up with celebrities, expatriates with other expatriates (thank you, pretzel), millionaires marry other millionaires... you try to find someone whose life cancels out the extraneous factors. I can see why, but it doesn't really address the ultimate problem we ALL face: does the person I am with really see ME?
>
> And to add to that, we seldom show our real selves because we are convinced deep down that we aren't all that lovable. LOL... so dating becomes a test: I'll hide who I am, and you come and find me.

I want to thank everyone for the comments to my original question here:

http://rr.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2nv3id/

Your kindness and sage advice was overwhelming, and I apologize for not commenting more in that thread. I did, however, read all of the comments. I also apologize if I did not respond to the man PMs I received. Several wanted to know who I was (sorry), some wanted to know about other ""famous people"" on Reddit (probably quite a few), and I especially appreciated the messages from those of you who have been in similar positions. Same with comments to that effect. 

My favorite PM was the one telling me to swallow some sort of pill with a link to a subreddit that I can only assume consists of troubled, aggressive 15-year-old boys who don't have mothers or sisters. Wow, no thanks, but you enjoy that...

Anyway, after thinking and reading I decided that maybe I was blowing the situation out of proportion but also that I needed to be honest about my feelings. She and I talked for a long time. I more or less told her everything that I said here. I debated about just showing her the post but decided against it. It was a great conversation and brought us much closer together. I'm happy to say that this conversation also led to the exclusivity talk. We are officially a couple now.

A few things:


* She apologized about the Facebook post but also explained it. She said that she assumed I was just a womanizing celebrity who got numbers just for the sake of doing so. The ""celebgirlfriend"" thing was sarcasm, as she figured I would never contact her. I did laugh at her use of hashtags on Facebook.


* She admitted to me that it was a bit overwhelming for a while because she figured I would just date within the industry. I guess she also Googled me and saw who I have dated in the past. I assured her I don't make comparisons like that. 


* She told me that the shock of things has worn off and now she just sees me as a person. She did joke about the character thing, and she said that she could never date the character I play. When she brings it up it is just some gentle ribbing. That made me feel kind of silly. 


* She said what many of you said--me being in a sitcom IS who I am. She can't just ignore that, but she said she is much more excited about the production work than any of the acting. She wants to know how things work. Me being an actor to her is not all that different than anything else, but she warned me that many of her friends might see it differently. Some already want to know if I'll introduce them to celebrities I've never met and probably will never met. If I did, I'd probably be in shock. When they realize how little of a deal I am, then I think we can easily blend our friend groups and whatnot.

A couple of you mentioned dating down, etc. She also informed me that she has two job offers for when she graduates at large firms. One is here and the other is in Portland. As of right now her plan is to stay here, and I factor into that. 

I am not looking at her as the person I am going to marry. Could she be? Yes. Then again, so could a lot of people in my past and my future. Instead, I am going to enjoy the ride. She was mature and did a lot of assuage my concerns. She even told me she thought I was using her for access to the university's library. Ha. 

She's beautiful, and so it seems, she does like me for me. Who knows where this will lead, but I sincerely appreciate all of the comments. They helped me to organize my thoughts and to just say, ""To hell with it,"" and actually talk to her.

Shall I grind a couple notches finer to accommodate? I like sweeter cups with a nice mouthfeel and though the taste is nice with the Abacas, the texture seemed a bit too light.

We started to message on Snapchat where i got to know him a little bit . He seemed quite sweet and friendly. But he started to push me to meet up. But we couldn’t because I was busy. We then met up. I met him at the cafe where I was. 

We had a chat about lives, he told me a few stories about his experiences and it was pretty cool. We then went for a walk in the walk way I had found. It was a beautiful little wooded area little bit away from town but you could see the town opposite and people would travel on boats on the canal. 

We went for the walk where we were chatting and having a good time, he made me laugh and I was nervous about this date.

When we reached a little wooden plank to sit on right next to the canal we were talking about bartending and shots. 

Then I laid down and he laid next to me and started to touch me up. He felt my chest, then started to rub his nose on my neck. I was frozen and I could feel his weight on me, and couldn’t breathe. All I could smell was his breath and I felt uncomfortable and froze. Staring up at the sky. 

He then started to grind his hips on me. And I just stared at the sky. Frozen.

He was like “Let me show you some moves.” And I was like ok…? 


So we did some defensive moves and then he started again while I just laid there. 

When we went back to town because he had to go home. I started hyperventilating. 
 I was uncomfortable. 

When I got home. I took a shower and scrubbed myself hard.

When I got the machine a few weeks ago I could reset them properly. Even a complete factory reset of the machine no longer helps, it's like the unit became permanently corrupted.

It's not a dating app. I am positioning it as a booking app where you can sell yourself for your interests. 

A few examples:
1. One fine Sunday evening, if you just want to go for a walk or a coffee, but if you don't want to go alone, you can book a companion of your interests nearby you to go. 
2. If you're skillful in any area like chess, pickle ball, guitar etc., you looking for a companion you can go and book. 
3. It's upto you how you want to sell yourself (skill, interests, travel, fun, or date), but once booking is done people can rate you and give comment about your vibe. 
4. Additionally, you can chat and share your meeting photos in the gallery section. 

Hourly rates depend anywhere between 49-999 depends on your booking preference.

Bathroom was small, minor plumbing issues, but functional.  And a window that opens for fresh air (or a fire exit LOL). The public areas were more interesting, and well appointed. Chill. Lots of picture opportunities, 

What really sold the place to us was the Amedment 21 speak-easy on the main floor. Food was fabulous, well presented, and a full bar with a fireplace, made things cozy for our party of four.

I turned 21 a bit ago and live in NRW, Germany, very close to the Netherlands and Belgium. I'm 198cm tall, athletic, and I'd say I'm kinda cute? (I'll send selfies early on so you can be the judge of that yourself!). I finished my bachelors of law this thursday and I currently work in public administration in an upper-level role.

**In my free time, I'm into**

* **Reading**
* **Artsy stuff** (Writing, making clay figures, taking photos)
* **Cooking** (I love showing care through food!)
* **Gaming** (would love to play some co-op together - big fan of co-op horror if that's your vibe!)
* **Binge-watching shows** (maybe watch the final season of Stranger Things together now that it´s out? My taste is pretty broad and ranges from Gravity Falls to Chernobyl)
* **Fitness** (mostly lifting, jogging and calisthenics)
* **Traveling**
* **Self-care** (I have a real love for fragrances and taking care of myself)

I'm the calm, confident, and dependable type. I'm direct in communication and I keep my plans. In public I'm pretty calm, but in private I'm very affectionate and playful. I really love taking care of the people I love through food, touch, words, and preparing surprises.

**What I hope we'll build**

I hope we can build something with a genuine friendship and genuine care as the foundation, without rushing anything. I'm looking for monogamy, adult communication, equal effort, and consistency. When we like each other, we act like it.

As for what I bring to the table for that:

* Stability & Dependability
* Availability (I protect time for my person)
* Maturity (and good, direct communication)
* A bit of silly, dry, gentle humor and teasing

I value those traits in others a lot as well. So what I'm ultimately looking for is deep, mature, mutual devotion. A relationship where we both give to each other because it makes us happy. Not because we need each other to function, but because being together is fulfilling.

**Little dreams about us**

I'd love to travel a lot with you and make many memories! I'm already planning to go to Lapland and Japan/Taipei next year - ideally with the right person. A few dream spots:

* One of those glass igloo hotels in Lapland (PLEASE look them up, you won't regret it)
* Touring through Europe together in a van (maybe one that we build together?) and the same through rural Japan

That said, I'm also a bit of a homebody. Day-to-day, I picture steady and cozy weeknights, with new experiences on weekends and holidays. And if we do end up working out, my favorite thing to do together, especially in winter, would always be cuddling up and watching shows in bed together.

**Thanks for reading <3**

I'm not too experienced with relationships, but I've put a lot of thought into what I want and what I can give. Life's been going really well lately, I feel steady, content and I feel like I have a lot to give. Because of that, I've had the growing feeling that someone is missing (You!). Like the titel implies, I´d prefer to meet someone from NL/BE/DE so meeting up and spending time will be a lot easier.

**So, get in those DMs already!**

A quick hello with your age and the city you're in is a perfect start. To get us talking, tell me what kind of date we'll be doing first: coffee, a museum, Weihnachtsmarkt or one of your suggestions!

The doctor prescribed me 0,5 mg Xanax for anxiety and sleep on an ad hoc basis. She said I could increase the dose I take, but I don't remember the details.

I take less than one pill a week, but recently, even with it, it still takes me ages to fall asleep.

Do you think it would be okay to briefly increase the dosage to 1 mg, without any adverse effects? Would the sleep be refreshing enough, and would I still be alert the next day?

I'd like to do it tonight to make sure it goes well, and then on Sunday night as well. My job interview is on Monday afternoon.

Basically, I need to:

* sleep great between Saturday and Sunday
* be alert and productive on Sunday (to finish prepping for the interview)
* sleep great between Sunday and Monday
* be alert and productive on Monday (to finish prepping, and then to perform well in the interview)

This is going to be very long and very detailed!

 
First of all, I almost sheepishly have to say that our day was perfect – nothing went wrong. Some of this was luck and most of this was because of the awesome people we had supporting us over the weekend.

 
Us: We’re an older couple – I (F) just turned 50 (was 49 on my wedding day) and my husband (M) turned 60 earlier this year. We got engaged about a year before our wedding date but had been together for over eight years at the time and knew it was coming; marriage was something we discussed frequently but were waiting until other aspects of our lives were more settled. We’d been living together for four years. My husband had been married once before. Neither of us make a tonne of money – we live comfortably enough but home ownership is a dream that seems out of reach. We live in Toronto.

 
I’d been saving up throughout the pandemic and was also gifted with a very generous $20,000 from my mother (FAR more than I’d anticipated) and $2,500 from my uncle’s estate. This generosity allowed us to make a lot of choices we couldn’t have made otherwise, and I recognize how fortunate we were! We would have had a lovely wedding in any case, but this allowed us to choose what we really wanted.

 
Invitations – We used [WithJoy](https://withjoy.com/) to send out our invitations and save-the dates, and we also used them for our wedding website. Everything was paperless. It worked pretty well, and their customer service was helpful. We used the basic, free save-the-dates, and paid to include a photo from our engagement photo session for the invitations, at a cost of $109.76. We got engaged in November 2024, sent out our Save-the Dates at the end of December 2024, and sent out our invitations in July 2025 for our November 8, 2025 wedding. We had a deadline of September 21^(st) – a little earlier than everyone seemed to advise, but we needed headcounts not just for catering, but for dorm room assignments and our wedding favour… more on that later. We invited 85 guests. 67 people RSVP’ed “yes.” We had to chase about 15 people down after the deadline. The people unable to attend could not do so for a variety of distance, financial, and health reasons which we completely understood and mostly anticipated. Two people ended up having to cancel after the deadline – one who found it too difficult to get to the venue and one who was ill. Both people let us know as soon as they could and were totally kind and sorry about it. There was one plus one who just didn’t show up and I was never given an explanation, but I think it was due to a rocky relationship between that person and the invited guest. We did not provide plus ones across the board but included known partners of all our friends and family members and provided plus ones for people who would not know anyone else at the wedding and/or had accessibility needs. We made a note of this on our website and advised guests that they could let us know if they felt a plus one should be given.

 
We only invited people we wanted to share our day with, and there were some notable people not in attendance because of this. We chose not to invite one of my two stepbrothers because we really wanted his son (my nephew) to attend, and they are not in contact for very legitimate reasons. My step-brother is a difficult person with whom I am not at all close and we felt his presence would make the day uncomfortable for many guests and ourselves. We also did not invite my husband’s mother, who he has not been in contact with for over a year – they historically had a very unhealthy relationship. I know the word narcissist gets thrown around too much, but these two fit the bill completely. We worried their absence might be as awkward as their presence, but that was absolutely not the case. I don’t think we spent a second thinking about either one of them on our day, nobody asked uncomfortable questions, and I am certain our wedding day would not have been so perfect if they had shared it with us. We did not invite people we hadn’t maintained contact with throughout the years or people who felt obligatory. If we’d had a bigger venue we might have made some different choices, but we were both so happy with the relatively small guest list. It allowed us time to actually visit with everyone!

 
Wedding Party – This was small, comprised of my best friend as the maid of honour and my husband’s adult son as his best man. Our two flower girls were my 8-year-old niece and my best friend’s 8-year-old daughter.

 
Dress Code – Pfft. Everyone wore what they wanted, including the wedding party. Those who wanted to get dressed up did and those who wanted to dress down also did. It was so nice and everyone seemed to feel comfortable.

 
Venue – The venue was the first thing we found and we only ever visited one, which we secured immediately. I’d seen photos of weddings that took place at summer camps and loved the idea of having family and friends all stay together over a weekend in a beautiful, natural setting. I found out about the [Ganaraska Forest Centre](https://grca.on.ca/weddings-private-functions/weddings/) while researching these kinds of venues and fell in love. During the site visit on a cold December afternoon we were shown the beautiful reception area, the dorm rooms and suites that accommodated over 80 guests, and the stunning outdoor ceremony space. We would have preferred an early October wedding date for weather and colourful leaves reasons, but of course those dates had been secured ages ago. So we took the weekend of November 8^(th), crossing our fingers for a lingering fall and taking advantage of the off-season discounted rates. The venue provides all the infrastructure needed to host a wedding – catering kitchen, tables and chairs, and even an ATV and driver to transport guests with mobility needs to the ceremony site – but we had to figure everything else out on our own. It was for sure a DIY wedding. Communication with the venue was great – they answered all my questions, though often a few days later. $7,180, plus $1,000 deposit (which was returned a couple of weeks after the wedding).

 
These things were not super importantwant to us –we did not spend a stupid amount of money on attire, florals, or décor.

 
Attire – I wore a simple, bohemian dress we found at Simon’s. I’d imagined wearing white, but when I finally found this dress that was exactly what I’d been searching for in thrift shops and boutiques throughout Ontario, I was totally fine with wearing black instead! I’d budgeted up to $500 for the dress and ended up spending less than $200. We were planning to be married barefoot (pretty risky planning for an outdoor November wedding!) so I didn’t give footwear much thought until a couple of months before the wedding, when I started looking for sandals that were all boring or just not right. I surprised myself by falling in love with a pair of silver running shoes, on sale at Steve Madden for $55. My husband, who was completely opposed to the idea of wearing a suit, spent several months sourcing his outfit through three different Etsy vendors – he wore black linen pants, a black shirt, and a beautiful embroidered, lightweight robe. And no shoes! (He brought his everyday black zero drop sandals just in case.) His outfit cost about $300.

 
Rings – Ordered simple but lovely matching rings on Etsy – mine has the sun, his has the moon. $286.82.

 
Flowers – I wanted wildflower-esque bouquets – one for myself and two smaller ones for our two flower girls. We did not want or have any floral décor. We also purchased wrist corsages for my mom and my maid of honour and boutonnieres for my husband’s son/best man, my two brothers, and my father. [Holton Flowers](https://holtonflowers.com/) in Port Hope did a wonderful job of providing exactly the flowers we wanted. My mom picked them up on the wedding day. $450.

 
Décor – We let the natural surroundings and beautiful reception space just be themselves, and it was all the décor we needed. My husband made the centrepieces inspired by a romantic inside thing of ours. We wanted to have shark and heart balloons at each table, but the conservation area does not allow balloons. So we improvised! My husband created a design featuring shark and heart balloons that he printed and glued onto Bristol board which he attached to wooden paddles that sat in mason jars at each table.

 
Officiant – We thought this might be another place where we’d skimp but I am so glad we thought twice. I’m an atheist and my husband is a Buddhist and we are also not keen on some of the patriarchal trappings of a traditional wedding ceremony. We thought we’d find a justice of the peace or something for a quick, straightforward ceremony. But as I started looking into options I thought more about the significance of the ceremony – I mean, it’s what we’re all there for, right? I asked for recommendations here, and on facebook, and was directed to all kinds of links for people who just didn’t feel right; everyone seemed either too religious or too new age-y or annoying in a way that was supposed to be funny. It was also really important to us that our officiant be someone affirming of all kinds of relationships. And we found her! I cannot recommend [Sarah Hall](https://www.sarahhall.wedding/) enough. We went way under budget on some things that weren’t important so we splurged on our officiant. She created a personalized ceremony for us that evolved through Zoom discussions that in some instances felt almost like those marriage counselling sessions priests make you attend, but in the very best way – giving us space to really think and talk about what our commitment means and what our ceremony is honouring. My husband and I separately answered a number of thoughtful questions and Sarah used these answers to write our love story. We wrote our own vows which she reviewed and offered detailed feedback on. She felt like an old friend by the time we finally met in person on our wedding day and her delivery was so genuine and heartfelt. $1,100 – a steal for all the time and effort and heart she put into writing and talking through queries and concerns about our ceremony.

 
Food – I did a lot of research but ultimately decided to go with one of the venue’s preferred caterers – [Personal Touch Catering](https://personaltouchcatering.ca/). We knew catering would probably be our biggest expense and wanted to keep costs down by having a buffet style meal. We liked the variety of options provided by Personal Touch and opted for the Greek menu, which included souvlaki, potatoes, vegetables, and salad. We added on the basic appetizers, dessert table, coffee station, and late night poutine bar. The deal was absolutely sweetened by the 20% discount they were offering at the time we booked. We rented dishware, cutlery, and champagne glasses from them and also sourced a bartender through them. Their price included a gratuity charge. We did not do a tasting and just crossed our fingers! Everything was great. By no means was this a gourmet meal, but absolutely enjoyable; I’d say the main course was even better than anticipated. My husband and I missed out on the appetizers – we were having our pictures taken – so I can’t comment on those, but everything else was served on schedule. The catering team were so efficient and friendly – an absolute joy to work with. I sent a number of inquiries to the caterer before the event and she always provided answers, though sometimes her responses took a couple of days. The final cost for everything was just $7,072.14!

 
Drink – I am a recovering alcoholic and I don’t drink at all. My husband drinks very rarely. A number of non-drinkers were attending the wedding, including lots of kids. So instead of having a bottle of wine at every table we wanted a special drink that everyone could enjoy and so that we could all share in a toast. We spent months trying different non-alcoholic sparkling drinks and ciders and landed on Tost (original variety), so we bought 24 bottles – way more than enough for the tables – we will be drinking it for years. (Lucky us!) We bought these from the Sobr Market location in Burlington, where they were super helpful and even provided us with a 15% discount. We bought several cases of pop, still water, and sparkling water from Costco. Estimated cost for non-alcoholic drinks is $750, with half of that being for the Tost, and we still have about 3 cases of beverages sitting in our pantry. For alcohol, we had an open bar but only served beer and wine. We bought four 24s of beer, one 24 of Seltzers, and I can’t even remember how many bottles of wine. My mom put these all on her credit card so she could return anything that could be returned on the Monday following the wedding, and I believe the total was around $1,500. The person working at the LCBO suggested we buy the cans of beer as singles, which costs more initially but allowed us to return individual cans – great tip! In fact, after returning everything we didn’t use the final bill was only $395! Older crowd with lots of kids and non-drinkers = great wedding savings! The cost was so low that my mom just declared it a wedding gift (after giving us so much!) and wrote it off completely.

 
Linens – We rented more napkins and tablecloths than we needed from [Meadowvale Party Rentals](https://meadowvalepartyrentals.com/) in Mississauga for $323, including the $22 we paid after the wedding for the 10 napkins that went missing. We picked up and returned these ourselves. No complaints. They were professional and communicated well.

 
Photography – The only thing we found at the Toronto Bridal Show was the best photographer ever. We spent a fair bit of time researching photographers and when we discovered [Diego Moura](https://diegomouraphotography.com/) we just knew we’d found the one. His shots are so inspired and interesting while also being completely authentic. He’s an artist. We felt like we spent a lot here, but actually his prices are very competitive. Good photography involves so much work and time! Don’t skimp here! We originally chose a less expensive package but ultimately opted for one that included 2 photographers for 12 hours on the wedding day as well as an engagement shoot. When we saw the engagement photos we knew we had made the perfect choice. We just got our sneak peak wedding pictures and we are glowing all over again. They are so wonderful! I already feel like we have our money’s worth and we’re going to be getting 400 more photos by February 8^(th)!! Diego and his partner (in both work and life) Chelsey are both so much fun to work with. Enthusiastic, energetic, SO MUCH FUN! $5,650 after tax.

 
Music – My husband’s band played! All the band members were so excited to be involved and my husband had the best time playing for a roomful of people celebrating us. They played a 90 minute set of their excellent brand of instrumental psychedelic folk-rock. My husband and I are both huge music fans and curated two playlists – one for cocktails and dinner, and one for dancing. After dinner we had our first dance which led into the dancing playlist which we paused after a half an hour for the band to play and then restarted after the band’s set. No DJ. No cost!

 
Equipment – PA, speakers, and mics from Long & McQuade. $306.

 
Emcee – A good friend of ours took up the emceeing duties at no cost and did an excellent job. He kept things on track and introduced the speeches. It helps to have good friends with public speaking experience and big hearts.

 
Favour – We had a good one! My husband designed an amazing event t-shirt using one of the photos from our engagement session and his mad graphic design skills. We asked all guests to include their t-shirt size on their RSVPs. We had them all printed at [Toronto Tees](https://www.torontotees.com/) and they did such a great job. We had to amend the design at one stage and we also worked with them to alter the colouring. They were amazingly patient, helpful, and responsive. At the wedding we set up a “merch table” and my two 13-year-old nieces gave out the t-shirts to all the guests.

 
Day-of Coordinator – I thought we didn’t need one but did we ever! We used [Belle’s Events](https://bellesevents.ca/home), and Belle was amazing! We had three calls with her to go through the details ahead of time. She asked all the right questions and brought to our attention details we’d overlooked (Like, “What about ice??”) The day was so seamless because of her. I had no idea our officiant feared she was running late until about 10 minutes before she arrived (not late, but just in time!) She hit “play” on the playlists, she greeted the caterer, she set up all the tables, she kept track of the timeline, and because of her everything went the way it was supposed to. $1,500.

 
Hair & Make-Up – I opted to go into Port Hope, to [Studio 100](https://www.studio100.ca/), (a half hour drive from the centre) to have this done, as it was more cost effective than having someone come to the site. I had a trial done in August and was thrilled with the results. On the morning of the wedding, my mom, my maid of honour, and myself drove into town and we all had our hair done – I tried to pay for all of us, but my mom paid for her hair style when I wasn’t looking! I also had my make-up done. Jessica Pringle was my hair stylist and she was amazing! $620 including trial.

 
Set-Up/Tear Down – We had access to the Ganaraska Forest Centre at 5 pm on Friday and showed up there with car loads of drinks, linens, t-shirts, etc. My mom and my brother filled their cars, as did my husband and I. Family members and friends from out of town stayed at the centre with us the night before and they helped us fill the beer fridge with beer and the coolers with pop. My dad bought pizza for everyone. On Sunday morning my husband and I awoke at about 8:30 to find that the chairs and tables had all been properly stacked and everything had been cleaned up! We had to leave the centre by noon and had let guests who were staying overnight know that they would have to leave by 10:30, but by the time we woke up about half our guests were preparing to leave to beat a snowstorm that surprised everyone. We did a quick sweep of the reception hall, checked all the guest rooms, and packed up our vehicles, and were on the road by about 11. Our friends and family members were so incredibly helpful!

 
Weather – Here is where the luck comes in big time. It was pouring rain the day before and we were hit with a massive snowstorm the day after. But on our wedding day the sun came out and we were able to have our outdoor ceremony! Barefoot! It was chilly, but people were able to dress for the weather. We brought a basket of dollar store shawls and hotshots to the ceremony site for guests to use, and they did! People were only outside for about a half hour.

 
Weekend Overnight Guests – We advised all our guests that they could stay overnight following the ceremony and also let them know that they would be staying in simple, dorm style rooms with shared washroom facilities. There was no cost to them. We listed nearby hotels on our website for those who preferred a little more comfort. They indicated whether or not they would be staying on their RSVPs. We assigned rooms and sent them door codes a week before the wedding. Over half of our guests stayed overnight. Almost a third of our guests stayed on Friday night as well – close family members and close friends from out of town. We had purchased food and drinks from Costco beforehand, particularly grab and go breakfast items like cereal bars and box drinks. We bought way too much stuff.

 
Pre-Wedding Stuff – We didn’t have bachelor or bachelorette parties. I thought about it, but most of my closest friends live in faraway cities, specifically Ottawa, Halifax, and Edmonton. Plus, we’re old, and that stuff is expensive. Instead, I wanted them to be able to hang with us the night before, and they did! My aunt hosted a bridal shower for me and it was attended by about 20 people. It was so nice to have some of my guests meet one another before the wedding and I was so moved by the gesture and the distances many guests had travelled to be there. It was great to have an event with so many of the significant women and girls in my life (my nieces were included!)

 
My mom was amazing throughout everything. She offered so much financial and emotional support. She was an enthusiastic participant but never directed or expected anything. From what I’ve read here I understand what a fortunate situation I have. My husband and I had our wedding our way, and it was perfect. I married the love of my life and my favourite person on a beautiful day in a beautiful setting surrounded by people we love. It was the best!

I see the waitress, and it's one of those ""Oh my god, I have to talk to her"" moments. So obviously I am a civilized human being, so I was not going to ask her out right off the bat, of course. What I decided to do was give a soft compliment and see what happens. Which was when I told her, ""I like how you have your hair done; it's really great."" She said, ""Thank you, I really appreciate that."" This was not a fake response; it was legit. The first thing she does after I do that is she gleefully goes to her coworker and mentions that I did what I just did and it was a good vibe. She wasn't the main person serving me, so I never talked to her again, but I probably would have hit it off more if she came to my table again. I was purely keeping it in an organic and respectful manner. I did chat with the owner a bit after I was done, but with all that context, I would love to cross paths with her again. Should I go to the restaurant again in a week or so, or what do you think is the move to civilly make a move? Perhaps do your hair; if it still is looking great, maybe see if she remembers me? Then maybe give her a card with my number in a subtle way and just say something like. I would like to take you out for some coffee. I am giving you a card with my number; if you're up for it, hit me up. If not, that is that.

The professor unknowingly checks out the FMC at a coffee shop while he’s standing behind her, and then they bump into each other outside of the coffee shop and the coffee spills all over both of them. Later on, the two wolves carry her and her human roommates luggage upstairs to their dorm room… she confesses to her roommate that she’s a witch of some sort after the roommate brags about her and her family being activists for non-humans (because you weren’t supposed to tell people if you are a non-human). At one point in the book, the vampire and the two werewolves take the FMC on a hike in the mountains, where they introduce her to their fairy friends. At another point, they take her to a nearby lake out on a boat to go swimming. They all agree to be in a relationship with each other and protect the girl because they find out that there’s people coming after her… So the vampire tries to help her work on her powers because she was never taught when she was younger, and she’s able to grow massive trees up around them like a fort to protect them while she’s trying to follow her light through a door and see how powerful she really is.

I’m 36, a cat dad, and a man who thrives behind the lens. Photography, videography, graphic design, IT—I don’t just do it, I live it. I capture beauty, craft stories, and chase thrills that leave a mark. Always learning, always hungry for more.

When the world opens up, I live for adventure. Road trips that start on a whim, hikes that turn into photo missions, camping under the stars, or discovering hidden coffee shops and restaurants.

A muse who knows the power of her own fire, a best friend who can match my energy, and an intimate companion who craves nights that blur into mornings.

And guess what, he and his girlfriend broke up two years ago. He had come to Chennai to surprise her and asked me to paint them together… but he never got the chance to give it to her. He handed it to me “just for a while” and well… it’s been two years now.

It was a complicated situation. Her family is extremely strict and religious like a proper cult-level devotion and they wouldn’t let her marry outside their community. He tried his best, but she chose to stay with her family. Sometimes I really wonder… why do people love someone and give them hope when they already know how their family, background, or circumstances will turn out?

Anyway, the past is past. He seems to have moved on and is in love with someone else now. I don’t know anything about his ex tho

Finding this painting made me think…
What does it feel like to be forgotten so quickly?
It feels like an abandoned love story that had so much potential.

How many unseen paintings get left behind because of circumstances?
Do they ever “wonder” or fantasize what life would’ve been like if the people in them had chosen differently?

1p9wtk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1p9wtk0/where_the_trees_turn_red/,Where The Trees Turn Red,"Some say it marched out of the sea under a bloody moon, here to expel our town of all hope - a monster to punish the naive prospectors of Maple Oaks who spent their gold on false witch hunts; an avenger of the young women burnt at the pyre, drowning the land for rebirth. Others say it was summoned within the forest, rendering a body of shimmering water an ancient gateway. Not a monster, but a deity from a far-off pantheon to be used as a tool for occult ambition. It brought unrivalled life and good fortune to the woods and its creatures, warping the trees into divine guardians.

I think it was just a man. An affluent founder who built our mines, our port, and, over time, fabricated fables around his locale, concocting utter, fictitious folklore bullshit with the natives that would live on through a local museum.

And his descendants would follow suit, using fiction to hide the truth.

For most of the history class of '85, such fiction ended there - ambitious nonsense about our home's origin, with awe-inspiring malarky attached.

But for Ebony.

Oh, sweet, perfect Ebony.

A switch had flipped in her mind, and an obsession with uncovering the town's secrets had taken hold. Some ancient remnant of this 'thing', whatever it was, must linger somewhere out there, in the woods or across the shore.

Legends need some grain of truth, right?

As the sheriff's daughter, Ebony had every resource and privilege any eager sixteen-year-old could need to hunt local myths.

But, for as keen as she was, her father still set borders. Go dig up the beach and explore the woods, that's fine. But don't go too far out, don't go at night; don't go alone if it can be helped. And, like any spoiled rotten teenager, Ebony ignored all parental guidelines.

This was her quest; she was invincible.

Under the guise of the moonlight, 2 days after she hadn't returned home, by the oldest lake, they allegedly found her slumping out of the ground from where she'd buried herself in a burrow. Her legs were clawed-up and gnarled, her clothes torn, her body broken; whether she had tried to dig herself to safety after being attacked by wolves, or they came upon her while she was unearthing the mystery that lay under the dirt, remained unknown.

For a time.

'Rules' began soon after the story broke, enforced by a grief-stricken sheriff. Beyond a threshold, the woods are forbidden. Period. Yet it didn't prevent whimsical boys and girls from investigating the tantalising, freshly rumoured legend whispered quickly through the halls: Ebony's ghost haunts the forest.

Go at night, go to the lake, and you'll see the distraught phantom of a girl literally killed by her curiosity - still trying to uncover her mystery.

So they instilled a curfew. As the sun dips behind those looming, timeless hills, notoriously unkind officers of the law patrol the streets to ensure no more wayward youths trek into the foliage. And for 30 years, for every family and every home, that same curfew has remained. For those same 30 years, Ebony's story has warped and demented itself beyond recognition as another generation learns of our nocturnal, ritualistic tradition; as another generation questions what she thought she'd found to warrant wandering that far into the wild, in the dead of night. Had she seen anything at all? Or, alone in the woods, had *something* found her, and if so... was it still out there?

I was a part of the latest generation, absorbed by the gospel of the potentially abducted, lured, murdered, raped, cult-recruited, tree-fucking, or whatever sort of stupid girl she was 3 decades ago that made nightly outings impossible.

I was a child when I first truly noticed the odd, sacred hush that descended over our home - my tyke brain finally acknowledging that our life wasn't typical.

""Inside Autumn. Light's getting low."" Dad had called from the porch as the sun began its lazy bleed into the mountains.

I sat in the kitchen, swaying on a stool, as my usually chipper mother locked every door and drew every blind, offering an occasional peek into the dark - her lips pressed and her eyes narrow as her stoic husband stared at the clock.

""Think they'll hit the street early again?"" He asked her.

""Not likely.""

Confused, I asked them both, ""What're you talking about?""

My father looked at me, understanding that his little girl was now sentient enough to question what he found familiar, while Mom continued her routine checks.

""Come here, kiddo,"" he said, ushering me to join him by a window. ""I'll show you.""

Through the curtain, I saw porch lights flicker awake down the street. Neighbours called or forced their kids home with a frantic sharpness, and then, way off up the road towards town, the low growl of a car engine began - silent red and blue and purple headlights weaved between the trees, reflecting off closed windows where curious eyes met it.

""See that car? The lights?"" Dad asked.

I nodded.

""A good, honest man drove one just like it... once. He kept people safe. Until one day, he lost someone very important to him.""

""Did he find them?"" I asked him, too young then to comprehend the cause of this rooted, collective script we recited.

A little lump formed in his throat. ""He did, but-"" He tossed the words around in his head. ""They'd uh... gone to Heaven.""

""Like Aunty?""

""Yeah-yeah, like... like Aunty. And soon after... he went to Heaven too. So now, that car and others like it, every night, carry on what he did.""

""Keep us safe?""

""Exactly. They keep us all safe.""

Mom muttered something profane to herself in the hallway; Dad, ignoring her, continued.

""But to do that, we gotta stay inside. They get grumpy if we get in their way. Understand?""

I nodded, slowly, as another voice spoke from the stairs.

""Do you see her?!"" Sean, my delinquent older brother, who noticed, questioned, and listened far more than I did, asked our Mom.

""*Sean*."" Mom hissed, finally satisfied that our home was secure. His eager eyes scanned the room until they met mine, and a wave of embarrassment washed over him.

""See who?"" I asked quickly.

Dad moved to block my vision as Mom yanked Sean to one side and spat harsh, but heartfelt whispers into his face. Peeking round his frame, I could see the two enter a heated argument of both passion and resentment.

Dad moved my face to meet his, ""You'll catch on when you're older, Autumn.""

And older, I became.

I would come to learn that evenings belonged to the woods and whatever they held, but in our house, that created more wonder than dread. Sure, there was an unspoken caution, a yoke around our necks, but my parents never pushed panic or horror. Instead, their warnings glimmered with something closer to mischief - something my brother adopted far more than I did growing up.

As the routines were finalised, and I came of age, Mom would click the kettle, and Dad would lean back in his chair to recount stories he called 'old myths'. Stories of monsters from the sea and of Gods from the woods, and whatever other fables or fairytales he could remember.

Stories Ebony had told him, before she became one herself - a naive adventurer found half-buried in the earth.

Sometimes, I'd catch a glance between my parents - sharing knowledge, a private joke or insight once hovering beyond my reach.

They'd known her. They'd shared classes. They'd snuck out to go drinking in parks and smoke joints by the lighthouse long after dark.

They'd loved her.

And by God, they missed her - fascinated and frustrated and mortified by her decisions that night that shaped our town into what shaped us.

Sean started to keep a notebook, scribbling down half-remembered details, little theories of his own, the finales of stories that never felt quite finished. I thought it was silly, that he was becoming too obsessed like Mom and Dad's 'ghost friend', but I begged to hear more as much as he did. We'd crack Dad occasionally, and he'd spin a fresh version of some local, rumoured phenomenon or woodland oddity, and Mom would roll her eyes with a hesitant smile tugging at her mouth.

They never pretended to have all the answers, and they never pretended that it didn't frighten them or that the fate of their friend troubled them most nights, but they offered pieces - fostering a hunger in their children to fit them, maybe, one day, together.

But that hunger would starve.

When Sean became a young man, and I became a teenager, we were wise enough to sense what they were too careful to admit. This 'curiosity' would always be expecting, always listening, for answers that would never come - a puzzle left eternally unsolved - because... we *still* had a curfew to respect, we still had rules; a tradition to honour.

Be curious to your heart's content. Explore the parts of the woods where you are allowed during the day, before you reach the barbed fences. But there are borders - don't go too far out, don't go alone if it can be helped, and don't even think for a second about leaving the house at night, let alone going there. And like the good, well-raised children we were, as our curiosity grew bored - but never bored enough - we respected those borders.

Until the one night we didn't.

Until the one night I would tear my skin through bramble and feel dirt fester under my nails, warm blood on my face, and understand what it was that dwelled out there - nesting among crimson trees so foul... and so beautiful.

\-

The daytime brought its own rhythm, and outside our fortress, life moved with the familiar patterns of any town. College was an odd blend of comfort and absurdity. My crowd - a strange, but functional little crew - made such a blend bearable, and sometimes enjoyable.

There was Barney, with his bottomless backpack of books and anxious, bashful heart; always armed with some obscure pulp fiction wisdom or dusty trivia he'd dug up at 3 in the morning.

Kate, a brilliant, gothic dark cloud of sarcasm and wit, adorned in black lace and sharp eyeliner - drifting among us like a raven that had learned to tolerate pigeons. She liked to draw. A myriad of dreamlike monsters filled her sketchbook, asphyxiating me whenever I saw them, as did the wonder that could rarely leave her mouth.

Arthur, trouble on two legs, adored by every teacher he infuriated and the first to disrupt a lecture hall; a cocky shit who always found ways to get us into places we shouldn't be (excluding one obvious exception). Detentions were a weekly event with him, yet somehow, he was the charming glue that held us together in our worst moments.

And finally, me, a theatrical ginger dweeb of fluffy sweaters and radiating rambles.

A four-pointed lopsided constellation, bright in our own humble little orbit.

But then there was an occasional black hole that made its rounds, from a very, *very* different universe.

*Willow.*

She never drifted to our tables during lunch or lingered in the hallways with us. No, she floated above it all. Self-proclaimed queen bee of this backwater nowhere, daughter of the wealthiest family for miles, founder of a circle of vixens and jocks who were always on the edge of danger. If she raised an eyebrow, the room would shiver; if she snapped her fingers, doors opened.

Worse still, she was the white-haired devil whispering sweet nothings into Sean's ear, encouraging my brother to abandon all of his rules and barriers on half-baked promises.

She was not our friend. Being noticed by her was a curse, not a blessing. Her name was poison in our household, detested by our parents - many arguments spawned from the mention of her alone.

But on one afternoon, in the buzzing cafeteria of flickering lights, scraping trays and pockets of laughter, she strode in alone. I was halfway through listening to Arthur tease Barney about the disaster of a date he'd had when, for only a heartbeat, the room fell out of focus as the cafeteria door banged against the wall, damning us into silence, and in she marched - absent of her salivating little wolf pack, licking at her heels and beckoning to her every word.

Her runway-ready, head-turning miniskirts and white leather jackets were gone, replaced by baggy sweatpants and an obscenely large hoodie, the sleeves swallowing her hands. She looked and moved like... well, the rest of us for once.

And her face - Jesus, her face. No canvas of pristine makeup could hide the ugly, angry, blossoming blotch of red and purple bruising that nested under her eye.

Every soul stared as their queen, out of place in her kingdom, made her way to an empty corner table with her head ducked and shoulders hunched. For those precious few minutes, she was just another girl - battered, tired and alone - threatening to vanish into smoke if someone so much as called her name.

And painfully, achingly slowly, the room soon returned to normalcy as its new corner-bound husk lurked at the edges of our vision - something to gossip about.

Barney kept sneaking nervous glances, bewildered at the sigh. ""Snowflake's looking rough today, huh?"" He whispered. ""Who'd you think she annoyed?""

Kate arched a brow, sketchbook balanced on her lap, pretending not to look. ""Maybe her cult of plastic witches turned on her. Looking like shit does suit her, though,"" she muttered with a flick of her pencil.

Arthur leaned in with a grin. ""Or she *finally* ran her mouth at someone who doesn't care who her daddy is... and can throw a mean punch.""

Surprisingly, I found myself just feeling sorry for her. ""Everyone has a bad day,"" I said, not sure if I actually believed it or wished someone would say that about me if I ever sported a glistening shiner under my eye.

Arthur gave a low snort. ""Yeah, you're absolutely right, Autumn. But not a cunt like her.""

Kate then nudged my arm. ""She's looking at you, by the way.""

Those words sent a prickle across the back of my neck. I timidly looked over and, true to Kate's word, Willow was staring at me from her exiled corner, her hood suffocating her face. A silence choked our table and, for a moment, time itself seemed to slow. The cafeteria and its occupants fuzzed away, and all that existed was the space between us. Then she lifted her hand, and a single dior finger curled out from under her sleeve, demanding me to approach with a tiny, effortless motion - one that sent a shiver down my spine and threatened to drag me away from the safety net of my friends.

I shook my head, and the sounds of the room returned.

Arthur snapped his fingers in front of my face. ""Hello? You still with us?""

His voice was peripheral, diluted. Their concerned faces were smudges as they shot bewitching glances over at Willow.

*Willow?*

Willow wanted me.

Barney reached for my arm as I pushed back my chair, mouth full of food. ""Don't! Let her sit by herself.""

Kate, never one to sugarcoat, muttered, ""Yeah, sit down, Autumn. Don't be your brother,"" all while sketching a hollow-staring shade in the margins of her book.

Even Arthur dropped his usual act, scooting to try and block my path, smug grin gone. ""Dude, are you good?""

I wanted to listen, really. I wanted to stay in our planted little pond and laugh at in-jokes. But her eyes dragged me - practically led me on a leash - and I understood then how she could've charmed my resilient brother. Fuck, even looking like crap, she was mystic, humming in my veins while my better judgment screamed to shut her out. I barely noticed my body moving as I weaved around disappointed hands and disgruntled groans and sighs. Logic was gone. Whatever she wanted, whatever grim story she had, I had to know.

And so I let myself hopelessly drift to her table, into her dark mercy.

She glanced at me as I reached her, her bruised face near-unreadable, and then gave her attention to the divided room of interested and uninterested onlookers alike. No one was close enough to eavesdrop.

""Autumn, right?"" She beamed as I took a seat. ""Sean's sister?""

""Who did that to you?""

She didn't answer right away, just shifted, hiding herself even deeper in the folds of her hoodie. I could almost see her weighing in her mind how much to say. Her eyes then snapped to a shape coming closer, dragging a chair in its wake. I didn't need to look to see who it was as an unstoppable surge of confidence came over me.

""Was it your dad?"" Sean pressed, seemingly having manifested out of nowhere, knuckles twitching, eyes flicking over the bruising. He looked over his shoulder at my confused, relieved table of watching friends, offering them a wave and a reassuring smile.

Willow's laugh was a short, bitter burst. ""Oh, please, he wishes he were that brave. No, I just... fell.""

""Was it Ben? You overstepped?""

She paused and then nodded slowly.

""You've been seeing him without me?"" Sean asked.

""You haven’t?""

""Who's Ben?"" I chimed in.

The two looked at me, as if remembering I was there, and suddenly I felt like a little girl in my parents' kitchen again.

""Local press,"" Sean said. ""Red hair, built like a stick-"" he nodded grimly towards his damsel, ""-and the one who encourages this diva to believe she's above tradition.""

My stomach churned. ""You've been out there?! What, at night?!"" I tried not to sound desperate, but the words pathetically dribbled out.

A fowl grin stretched across her mouth. ""I told you she'd be keen."" She said to Sean.

I almost hissed at my brother. ""You too?! After everything Mom and Dad-""

""I've not even left the house *once*, Autumn... I promise.""

""Is that right?"" Willow teased.

""*Yes*."" He spat, pleads and warnings written all over his face. ""And try as you might, nothing you or that *alcoholic* says will change my mind."" He then ruffled my hair, pausing the racing curiosity that began to rush through my head. ""Or yours, I hope.""

Willow's gaze then met mine and held it. ""Y'know, I've heard things out there. You can come listen too if you're not scared-""

Sean planted a firm, but hesitant hand on the table and stood with a huff. ""Catch you later, Wills. Always a pleasure.""

""Oh, come on."" She pouted. ""I won't take her past the fences; even I'm not that stupid... well, maybe just a few feet. We could all go together, the three of us!"" Her voice was thin and cold, but beneath all the bravado, I could tell she was terrified.

The word left my mouth before I could stop it. ""When?""

Sean was quick to usher me away from the table with nought a word, like my life depended on it. Willow watched us the whole time, smiling from ear to ear with the utmost joy.

""Back to your friends, kiddo. Now.""

""I don't... why'd I-""

""*Autumn. Now.""*

I nodded, slowly, and made my way back to my sanctuary as Sean reclaimed his seat in the lion's den. Whatever they said to each other was lost to me, but they remained a pair until the bell rang. His affection became more visible - tucking a hair behind her ear, cupping her hand, all while staring ditzy daggers into her.

The rest of the afternoon was a blur. My friends hounded me, prying me with questions about what Willow wanted, what she'd said, what my brother had said, what the two of them 'were', and why in God's name I'd actually approached her. I deflected, lied, kept quiet - anything to keep them away. Yet their pestering was nothing compared to what the recesses of my own mind were doing to me.

I replayed every word of that conversation and, through it all, one name kept cycling around.

'Ben'

A man who could solve the unsolvable puzzle my parents had harmlessly planted in me.

By the final bell, I couldn't bear it any longer, and I folded. I confided in them everything I was thinking and feeling - another rant bubbling out of my mouth in disjointed sentences that, somehow, they could understand every word of.

Arthur proposed it first, stabbing a straw into his milkshake, after we'd escaped the spilling sea of student-filled halls - clambering their way outside to enjoy the rest of their afternoon - and sought refuge in a cafe booth.

""Why don't we pay him a visit?"" He took a long gulp of some vanilla delight. The others looked at him like he'd killed someone.

""Visit the jittery reporter who punched Willow in the face?"" Barney asked, digging into a slice of red velvet. ""What could go wrong?""

""Well, either that or we break curfew ourselves and let this one,"" Kate began, poking me in the ribs, almost spilling my tea, ""scratch her itch.""

""It's not an... 'itch', Kate.""

""Oh, sorry. Unresolved compulsion then?""

""Hey, back off."" Arthur butted in, and I almost thanked him, until I saw the look on his face. ""It's not her fault she got hypnotised by that white-haired bitch.""

They laughed at my expense; the stupidity, the absurdity of it all. And I did too.

Barney pushed his glasses up. ""Have you considered another outlet? Like, read a book-""

""Or get laid.""

""Or write music!"" Kate seemed exceptionally excited about her own idea. ""I can already picture your first single: 'I Was Found Dead In The Woods At 16'.""

""You guys suck.""

""No we don't.""

Arthur clasped his hands together. ""Anyway! Suggestion still stands: we visit this guy.""

Barney groaned, ""I don't know, man... Mom would always say-""

""Ugh, your Mom says *anything*, Barn. And it ain't up to you, right boss?""

The three of them looked at me: Arthur, eager and giddy; Kate, curious and cautious; Barney, frightened and shaking his head. Was I really going to drag them along to a far-off part of town to question a man I'd never met about local legends and parental bedtime stories, all storming from the unsettling words a girl (none of us liked) had given me?

Of course I was.

\-

The local press office was a rundown, narrow building wedged between a dead laundromat and a fading convenience store - its red brick hull stained dark by years of rain and grime. Dusty, crowded windows made it impossible to see inside, weeds poked through the cracked pavement, and the front door barely held itself together on worn hinges.

""Yeah, no thanks."" Barney squeaked, turning on his heel and walking away before Arthur tugged him back by his ear.

Kate inspected the building, eyeing it up and down like a piece of abstract art. ""Did your brother mention *why* he or Willow talked to this guy?""

""Nope.""

""Marvellous.""

I didn't bother with knocking; I strode right up to the door and stepped inside.

Beyond an unmanned reception, a few desks packed the room - piled high with yellowed notepads, sticky notes and old newspapers. The stink of old coffee, cheap booze, and burnt rubber attacked my nose as I ventured into the rioting clutter. My boots scuffed against the fading floor as a fly buzzed in circles over an empty mug.

""Hello?!"" I called.

No answer.

Kate gagged as she and the others filtered in behind me. ""Ew-fuck. It smells like someone died in here.""

Arthur slapped a cracked counter, fluttering a bundle of papers into the air. ""Perfect. I'm ready to see a ghost, how about y'all?""

""You're more likely to see rats, Arthur."" She added, trailing a finger over a dusty desk, painting lines and shapes.

I found myself drawn to a wall of photographs - a timeline of the town's many faded celebrations and events, but nothing stood out. No mention of our town intertwined with a grand fate; no mention of a lost name.

Barney, at first, hung back - overwhelmed by the smell and disorder. But even he soon found himself drawn in, and he shuffled over to a cramped bookshelf, overflowing with almanacks and faded paperbacks. ""Guys,"" he cried, peering down at the floor, ""come take a look at this.""

We gathered around, not knowing this would be the pivot point, as Barney stared at thin, dark streaks scarring along the floor, half-hidden under the shelf. Arthur's hands immediately flew to its sides, and, with a grunt, he tugged hard. The unit groaned but didn't move. I chose to feel along the edge instead, searching for - there. My fingers brushed a catch beneath the lowest shelf. A soft click sounded, and the whole unit lurched, swinging open on hinges to reveal a dark staircase - stretching down into the guts of the building.

""Oh, God no,"" Barney whispered, with a tiny hint of uncharacteristic thrill.

""You fucking found it, dork,"" Kate said. ""What're you complaining about?""

""And oh, God, *yes*, you mean?"" Arthur joked, eyes sparkling. ""Ladies first."" He then added, gesturing for me to take the first step.

I hesitated, only for a moment, before taking the first cautious step into the shadows with a shit-eating smile on my face.

So quick. So easy. Far, far too easy. No time to savour the anticipation; awe eclipsed every worry, every rational thought, as the adventure unfolded before us. I soaked myself in the thrills, each of my nerves shot with reckless curiosity, not once stopping to ask questions.

It spat us out into a large, sweltering room washed in a sickly, red glow. The stink of alcohol was more pungent down here, wafting through the stale air. Strings of thumbtacks and curling, ancient photographs lined the walls: a blurry picture of an old lake, a crowd at a festival, an evening shot of a rich, starry sky; figures vanishing behind trees, snapshots of a distant woods bathed in purple light, wide-eyed faces from decade-old yearbooks.

A lair adorned with the collections of a private investigator.

Dilapidated, torn pieces of archived newspaper were neatly lined on tables, screaming local tragedies, accompanied by police forms, council records and government files that had almost bled dry of ink - margins etched with hastily scribbled notes. A cold knot formed in the pit of my stomach as my eyes darted over them. Shut away relics of decades past leapt from the pages and clamped themselves to my chest. They should've just been old stories, forgotten pains, but arranged together, they became an accusation.

'Search For Missing Hiker Continues'

'Police Abandons Search For Missing Son - Family Left Without Answers'

'Search For Missing Girl Continues'

'History Repeats? Another Youth Vanishes Near Old Mines'

'Strange Lights Spotted By Shoreline!'

'Search Continues For Missing Dog'

Dozens of absent resolutions; the words began absorbing together.

'*Search Continues*...'

Fucking search continues, search continues, search continues!

No remains discovered, nothing discovered, nothing e*ver* discovered, no one ever found, no bodies found.

Not even one.

I felt something rising in my throat I couldn't explain. The others had joined me around the table, reading the headlines we'd never known existed in silence, their faces tightening.

A myriad of unspeakable, unanswered losses mouldering for at least 50 years.

This was no adventure; this was a warning.

Did Mom and Dad know?

'Local Sheriff Disappears - Foul Play Suspected'

'Community Divided Over Nighttime Curfew'

'Who Is Enforcing The New Rules? Authorities Silent!'

Kate drifted away from the crowded table and let her attention settle on a map. ""Autumn!"" I ripped myself away, leaving Arthur and Barney to sift through more paper galore. The map was one of the woods (of course), riddled with illegible scrawls and red markings noting boundaries, but what had her focus was an old calendar taped to the corner - days crossed in black marker pen, others circled and annotated with different, tidier hands.

Willow's name was infrequent enough to spot.

And so was Sean's.

My fingers zipped over clustered markings, piecing together how specific dates lined with shaded areas on the map. They'd been charting, beyond the fences, but there was a threshold that even they hadn't dared cross.

That changed tonight.

The air pressed in, and I couldn't breathe. I steadied myself on the edge of a table - shaking, head spinning, heart pounding like a kick drum in my chest. I didn't know what I wanted to find here, but this was *not* it. Distant and muffled, their voices reached me and drew me back; a hand on the shoulder with some grounding words. Arthur said a joke, I think, Barney muttered something soft, and Kate held my hand - it wasn't grand, there was no fanfare, but it was enough.

When I could finally speak again, it came out in a croak. ""What do we do?"" The question hung heavy in the air. Too many options: go to the police (and tell them what?), go to my parents (and be put in solitary?)... or-

Arthur spoke as if reading my mind. ""We could go to the woods.""

""Not a chance!"" Barney whined. ""I've not even... *been* to the fences, none of us have; I'm not going there. And it's bear season-""

Kate couldn't believe what she heard. ""Bears?"" She gestured to the room we stood in. ""That's your biggest worry?... *Bears?* Not the fact that we'll likely vanish into fucking-*""*

""Guys!"" I shouted, for what felt like the first time in years. ""Can we... not argue, please?"" I then looked at Arthur. ""Get a picture of that map.""

Barney shrivelled up into himself. ""No, we can't-""

Kate punched him in the shoulder. ""We can, and we are.""

Retracing our steps, we slipped back up the cracking staircase one by one. Behind the battered front door, afternoon had already begun its dwindling descent into dusk. I don't remember what we said to each other as we fumbled back out onto the street - making and questioning plans in the span of seconds - but I do remember who stood waiting for us.

Sean leaned against the hood of his car, arms crossed, jaw tight. When our eyes met, he opened the passenger door and gave a single, sharp commanding nod to the seat.

No one spoke.

Kate kept looking between us; Arthur bristled; Barney gulped, fidgeting with his pack.

I eventually forced out a small, wavering smile as a revolting, impulsive thought overtook me. Perhaps it *really* was an adventure, a quest... but it wasn't theirs. ""Maybe we just go home and sleep on it instead. Clear our heads.""

""Not a chance."" Arthur pressed quietly.

""Arthur, it's late and I'm tired. I'll text you when I'm home. Promise."" I lied.

""Are you sure?"" Kate asked slowly.

I nodded, and she, unsatisfied, painstakingly gathered the others to start their walks home.

But Arthur lingered. ""See you tomorrow."" He said, more like a demand than a farewell.

Even Barney showed some resistance, but they soon trailed off, leaving me on a darkening street.

I slid into the passenger seat beside my silent brother, and the car door shut with a heavy finality.

He watched my friends round a corner before he spoke. ""Do you want to go home?""

His question slowed the whirling storm in my head. The idea of home - its warm, routine 'normalcy' - comforted me. But it did not scratch gnawing itches. I stared out the window, watching slivers of sunlight begin to hide behind the trees.

""No.""

Sean felt his jacket and produced his little, rugged notebook - its edges worn by years of restless fingers. ""Last chance.""

""I'm sure.""

He managed a comforting smile. ""Okay.""

He put the car in drive, and we took off down the street.

\-

He navigated us through tucked-away, less-travelled roads before the scouts began their patrol, until we reached the town's edge. The car rolled to a stop in an abandoned parking lot infested with pine needles, the depth of the woods just looming beyond a bygone footpath.

At a threshold, the tall, stark black shapes of thick, barbed metal fences, stretching for at least an acre and far higher than any man, tried to ward us away from the wild maw they quarantined.

Not tonight.

Two figures waited beneath a flickering, dying light: Willow, and Ben - red-haired, rail-thin, and staggering slightly on light feet.

Sean killed the engine. A bird called from the trees as he made his way out of the car and towards his crew. I followed tightly behind, not sure what to feel, as Willow offered a happy wave while Ben's rickety fingers twisted around a heavy, military flashlight.

""Who's this?"" He nearly slurred out.

Willow answered before Sean could open his mouth. ""His sister.""

""Huh. Impeccable timing, kid.""

An anxious energy came over Sean. ""Hey, so, maybe we don't go as far-"" he pointed down at me, the pathetic, nervous weight almost attached to his hip.

Ben laughed. ""Don't be getting cold feet, Seany-boy, now you got a tag-along.""

Willow laughed too, and I pretended not to spot the tremble in her lip.

Sean rested a firm grip on my shoulder. ""We'll turn back if you find it too much, okay?""

""Heads up!"" Ben warned, as a stream of red, blue and purple lights danced over a hill and made their way down towards the lot.

We were gone by the time they found Sean's car.

Crunching over brittle grass, we snaked through the woods until we reached the monolith. It seemed flimsy up close, a patchwork of tired metal smeared with rust and graffiti, and dead, segmented searchlights adorning the tops. They found the gap easily - a ragged hole crudely carved into the sheet metal, its rim twisted and sharp.

One by one, we slipped through, and my haste earned a few cuts along my sweater.

For a mile, we pushed deeper in total silence - broken only by a clumsy step and a shiver in the wind. I caught glimpses of little 'X's' marked on some trees and rocks, as the path became rougher, revealing themselves when flashlight cones stroked over them.

I saw a 'W + S' carved into one maple tree, cuddled in a love heart.

Willow's voice nearly scared my skin off. ""Listen.""

Something changed - the voiding silence, gradually, warped into a series of coarse, pained echoing croaks originating from somewhere far, far ahead in the dark. The wind scratched and rattled its way through wounded, cracked bark as my ears strained and every instinct wailed at me to turn around and run.

My brother took my hand instead. And we continued.

""What is that?"" I asked.

""No idea."" Was all he could say.

Night fully settled over the woods, the moon and the stars obscured by dense trees. I couldn't tell how much further we walked or for how long.

I checked my phone.

Dead. Impossible.

Sean noticed. ""Hope you messaged Arthur.""

I hadn't. *Shit*.

Before I could think, we came upon a still, unmoving river stream - flashlights glimmering across the shallow, black water's surface. The three of them stopped. This must've been the edge of their familiarity.

Ben charged forward, producing a polaroid camera from a satchel. It was evident from the way he walked that his courage came from a bottle. I wondered briefly what kind of war waged in his head, as Willow went to follow him.

Sean stopped her. ""We could leave him to it. He'll tell us anyway, whether we're with him or not.""

Willow let out a tiny laugh. ""You want what I want, right?"" Then she looked at me. ""Having fun yet?"" She broke away from him and followed the bobbing head of red hair into the breach.

Sean sighed, hesitant to follow.

""I'm not scared."" I blurted out.

""I know, but-""

I watched sense and reason come over him in a single moment. It hit me, too.

What the *fuck* were we doing?

It lasted only a second; this lucid cut into the adventure, telling us to go home. Then, just as quickly, gleeful shouts and exclamations pulled us effortlessly onwards.

Several meters beyond the river, one tree stood apart - a towering sentinel marred by something uncanny. A crimson mould covered its bark in thick, shulking veins, twisting and threading through its grooves like a cancer. The colour was impossibly rich, both disgusting and hypnotic, and the texture looked more like a synthetic glass.

Then it pulsed, dimly. A faint red glow breathed to life within the mould, slow and steady, synchronised... to the slow rhythm of a heartbeat.

Willow was beside herself as Ben snapped a picture of the growth. Then he touched it.

The mould trembled and released a cloud of faint, powdery spores into the air, which quickly scattered. A single red vein at the root of the tree flared to life, pulsating with more luscious light. It stretched along the ground - its visibility was a complete defiance of logic, as if the earth itself was translucent. The vein bent deeper into the woods.

Like sheep, we followed.

Every single tree was consumed in the same, lurid mass - shimmering in unusual palettes of red and garnet - some far more infected than others. Even the floor was terraformed by the stuff, puffing at our feet. The pulsing lights grew brighter as thick, euphoric fogs drifted among the trunks, sweet and dizzying and as the haze settled... the lights revealed a truth.

Silhouettes - human and animal both - curled, fetal and motionless, were encased and suspended within the bodies of the trees themselves.

""We should... probably leave,"" Sean said, dreary and sheepish. ""Tell someone.""

I cannot explain why Ben chose to rush one of the trees, tearing desperately at the mould in a panicked bid to save the person imprisoned within.

I *can* explain how the forest responded.

The ground convulsed and split open, revealing worming interconnected tunnels beneath us, and a gangling *thing* emerged out at horrifying speed. Its towering, sharp humanoid body was woven of the same pulsing red mould, and it moved with an unnatural, sinewy grace as it mercilessly lunged towards Ben.

It ripped him apart in seconds, splattering us as his flesh tore and bones snapped, his screams lost beneath the swelling, heart-throb of the woods.

The adventure was over. This was a nightmare.

In the chaos and horror, a jolt of raw clarity rushed through me - my vision sharpened, and the soft charm of the woods lifted as I held my breath. I became pitifully aware of the creature's sounds as it clicked and hissed, feeling and searching around its vicinity.

It had no face.

No ears, no eyes, no mouth.

It moved in tandem with the mould's pulse.

Sean came to the same conclusion I did as his hand found mine. He reached into the folds of his jacket and threw his notebook as far as his arm would allow. The creature spasmed and dove to where it landed, clawing and tearing into the ground, shredding the bundle of leather and paper.

Sean's other hand found Willow's, silent and stiff. And we ran.

It was a desperate flight back through the woods, Sean's grip fierce as the monster splintered and retched after us - each step we took triggered a poof of blood-red light to burst from the mould, guiding the thing to us. Every stumble, every cut and scrape, every gasp seemed to vibrate the air as it pursued, tracking our every pace, tireless and quick, but just far away enough.

Then we splashed over the river.

I spun back to see it halt amidst the thicket, shaking, uncertain, its senses dulled - the network of mould beneath it had almost broken. Then it gagged and yelped as the ground opened again, reclaiming its soldier.

The silent trudge back felt much shorter than the journey in.

As we reached the hole in the fence, a searing flash of purple light erupted around us, obliterating the dark. Out of the blur, stern men in dark suits swarmed forward, barking muted commands. They swept us up, herded us away from the woods - no explanation, just tight grips and hurried steps and lights drilled into my eyes.

It was numbing.

Everything passed like a shutter click: the lights, the door, the engine of a police car, the sirens, the walk up my porch. My parents, wild with terror, embraced Sean and me with questions spilling out of their mouths, but all I could do was collapse into their arms, unable to look them in the eye.

My bedroom has never felt this cold; this quiet.

There are slashes up my sleeves and across my hands, my knees are scraped, a gash is across my leg, and I think some of Ben's blood is stained in my eye.

No.

No, no pain pulses in my temples. Not mine; not entirely unpleasant.

I think my brother feels the same.

I see it when I close my eyes.

Not a monster from the sea, nor a God from the woods, nor a ghost girl by a lake.

Just mould. A beautiful, red mass, and a warm tree to rest my head.

Half of me is convinced to grab some kerosene and a match.

The other is a compulsion to go again.

I can go deeper, further. Much, *much* further.

Maybe I'll bring my friends.

Why can't it be their adventure, too?",8,1764442838.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False
1p9wsee,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1p9wsee/navigating_a_lot_of_sadness/,Navigating a lot of sadness,"I met a friend through mutual friends around 2016/2017. They were very funny, creative, genuine, caring, and they brought an energy that was always so fun to be around. I moved in with a friend in 2019 who is best friends with this person, and since the two of them are so close they were over a lot and we got to spend more time together.

In 2022 I moved from the west coast to New York and they moved there around the same time and we lived about 10-15 minutes from each other. We would take walks around the park, grab coffee, go to brunch, bars, and just had fun exploring the city and our neighborhoods together. I moved back in 2024 and my last text to them was that I was having a rough time mentally and emotionally while I was living in New York and the time we spent together really helped lift my spirits. They were such a kind and engaging person, I never told them what problems I was having but just spending time with them and them being themselves always made me feel better even with everything I had going on.

I found out they passed away a few days ago and I’m crushed. I don’t want to insert myself in spaces where their closest friends are grieving because they had a lot of friends much closer than me. I am hurting and navigating through their loss but I want to be respectful of those who were a lot closer to them and whose grief is much heavier. 

Overall I just feel really sad and I don’t feel like I have the right to talk about it with people because I don’t want to make it about me when there are a lot of folks who are hurting worse and we hadnt spoken in a while since I moved back and we were friends but not super close friends. Typing this out feels rambley but what I’m ultimately trying to say is that I’m grieving but want to be respectful and supportive of the people who are feeling everything much deeper given how close they were to this person.

I’m hurt and I think I’m forever changed from the loss of this friend. They were such a light in everyone’s lives and a kind spirit and I’m in such shock that they are gone. For the rest of my life I am promising myself that I will give people grace because you never truly know what others are going through or the internal battles they are fighting. I want to be better at telling my friends and loved ones what they mean to me because you truly do not know how much time we have together. I am deeply sad that this friend is gone and I’m deeply sad for everyone else I know who also loved this person. I want to do my best to honor them how I can. I’m still thinking of ways that I can do that.",2,1764442761.0,GriefSupport,1,1.0,False
1p9ws90,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1p9ws90/is_this_just_anxiety_or_something_else_venting/,Is this just anxiety or something else? Venting (Social anxiety or OCD?),"I am seeking professional help already. Just wondering if anyone has experienced this before!

I've been diagnosed with GAD and social anxiety but sometimes it feels extra obsessive. The thing is, I don't think I have any compulsions, at least not physical ones. And I somehow believe that all my obsessions are plausible and I want to do things to prevent them. Is social OCD a thing? What is the line between unrealistic excessive worrying and OCD?

I've always had social anxiety, but lately I've been really, really bothered by repetitive, obsessive rumination about people. Any task I do, my mind is flooded by tons of what ifs - what if this person saw this, what would they think, I should do it this way in case they ever come over and see it, I don't want them to think I'm a bad person for not doing it this way, I need to do it like them because I saw them do it like this years ago, etc etc. Everything I do. Constantly. Just really unnecessary what-ifs, and constantly having conversations/scenarios play out in my head. It's making it really hard to just... Be myself? And I'm so sick of it. Then I feel guilty about being self-centered.

Another thing that I obsess over is possessions - I get in these thinking spirals about how many things I have, how many of them are made out of plastic, feeling intense guilt, shaming myself for owning things, thinking of ways I could own more natural materials, wondering how the paint on the walls will affect the environment in the future, (dumb, specific stuff like that) when all I'm doing is putting up some Christmas decorations. I find myself always singing a song in my head between having these thoughts, like repeating over and over but it's not something that I am doing on purpose, I just sing and hum all the time anyways - even if I'm in a good mood.

I also worry intensely about being perfect, and doing things the ""right"" way. If I want to buy something, I research a lot and become stressed out about making the best, most correct decision. I also think about how other people will think of me if they see what I buy and judge if I made the right decision.

The only things I do that might be considered ""compulsions"" is ask for reassurance, deep cleaning something (and thinking about how I'm cleaning it and if it's the ""best"" way), picking skin/general fidgeting, over-explaining my decisions to other people and waiting for their reassurance. But it's not like I HAVE to do these things. I just want to.

These thoughts always revolve around the most trivial things. Making coffee, making a small purchase, going to the mall, deciding to have a snack, the health of my dog, buying gifts for people, the list goes on...

I worry SO much about pleasing other people and being seen a certain way, and I obsess over this all the time. I feel so self-centered!! Is this just a symptom of social anxiety or something more? Usually I only feel social anxiety when I'm around new people, but these thoughts happen when I'm by myself.

I've done some CBT stuff in the past, a lot as a kid, which I heard can make OCD worse. I actually found it helpful for the most part, just hard to stick to. So if CBT helps me, maybe I don't have OCD?

Luckily I have an appointment with my psychiatrist soon but I'm nervous to bring this up in case she thinks I just want another diagnosis for fun. I have convinced myself that it's my fault for thinking this way and I did this to myself and now I'm making it worse on purpose :') and I feel like I'm not doing enough work on myself to deserve seeing her all the time or something. Like she's sick of me.

Btw I'm currently taking Wellbutrin and Cipralex for depression/anxiety, in case that matters.

1p9wr2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1p9wr2w/in_defence_of_online_dating/,In Defence of Online Dating,"Online dating gets slated as awful on here a lot but I actually like it. Yes, it has issues but I thought it would be interesting to hear people’s positives.


Here are some of mine:

1. Meet people I wouldn’t otherwise - I’m not a big clubber or drinker and when I’m at events like gigs or shows I’d much rather do the thing I’ve paid to do, so I don’t get many chances to meet people in real life. Apps are a great way to negate this.

2. Relaxed intros - Real life approaches are so tricky, what crosses a line for one person could be the perfect approach for someone else. On apps, we both know what we’re there for, so being a bit more forward is so much easier.

3. Knowing how the algorithm works - I have found this so helpful, we know apps aren’t ideal so you’ve got to play the game a bit. Knowing the tricks has been super helpful.

4. Good for self-reflection - Making the profile online was a great way for me to assess the things in my life I need others to know about. Because of that, I created a kind of hierarchy of self-identity and have been able to reassess my single life to do more of the things I love. Being content means less pressure on finding a date and less pressure on dating apps.

5. Fun getting to know people - I really enjoy getting to know people, asking all about them, sharing stories, and chatting utter drivel. The apps are little things in your phone designed for direct contact with another human. Surely that’s a good thing!?

6. Safer than real life - This is more true for women than men, but I’ve definitely found myself in sketchy situations when dating so can only imagine how much worse it is for the ladies. Spotting red flags and signs of poor behaviour before ever being in the same room as someone is always a good thing.

7. No pressure - if you think about it, there’s actually no pressure to online dating. Here’s a person you never would have spoken to otherwise, it’s extremely unlikely that they’re “the one” but you might have some fun with them, make a new friend or discover something new about yourself. And if they turn out to be crazier than the crazy cat lady from the Simpsons trapped in a cat cafe with nothing but a bottle of tequila then that’s a great story!

Things that help me:
1. Average looking guy, good profile - I’m not stunningly hot (a bit weedy, short and bad teeth) but I’m not awful to look at (good jawline, nice eyes). But I’ve maximised my profile by being funny, interesting and picking pictures that accentuate my good features.

2. Disposable income - At this point in my 30s I can afford to spend money on subscriptions and, more importantly, good dates. Buying dinner or some coffee is a good start, if there’s a book that I think would appeal I might buy them that as a present for our first date. The costs don’t have to be huge, some money on a pool table or a special chocolate they’ve mentioned.

3. Time and energy - I have time to spend going through apps, I know not everyone does. But just twenty minutes a day increases your chances of matching with people massively. Do it regularly and you get big boosts in other people’s feeds.

4. Knowing the algorithm - regularly restart your profile (once every 3/4 months) because new accounts get boosted more. Regular use helps push you up too. But talking to your matches and having longer convos helps show you as a good match even if you don’t totally dig the person, definitely worth the time investment as you’ll get shown to way more people. If you’re on and off the apps it buries you, so I take regular breaks when it all gets too much and start again when I’m ready.",0,1764442672.0,dating_advice,4,0.33,False

It hurts to write this message but I’ve learned a hard lesson from trying to figure this out, and whatever happens I am on the path to doing the right thing. 

I am 25 years old from a major city in New England and have a little over $25,000 in debt that is either in collections or months overdue. 

I started my credit journey great, had a credit score in the 800s, graduated early, made good money as a game developer, but my mom had medical issues during the pandemic and I made the stupid decision to pay the bills with my credit cards not understanding its easier to negotiate those (20 years old with high limits). 
I was shortly laid off (covid) and had to change career paths to make ends meet. By the time everything was over, my job had been replaced by AI, I never got rehired. 

I was previously in credit counseling but due to more life changes down the line, I could no longer afford to make payments on my program.

This debt also includes a $5,400 loan for a motorcycle that is co-signed/co-owned that has been charged-off after 3 months of non-payment. This has not been repoed yet. 

There are a couple of miscellaneous debts as well such as some medical debt, affirm,  EZPass, etc… 

I would estimate a total of $27,000 of debt (+25K in student loans I haven’t started paying)

I feel like I am finally in a semi-stable place, but have been living paycheck to paycheck. I work for a major corporation and make $65,000 a year (48,000 after taxes) and pay $2265 a month in rent, utilities included. This is a “cheaper” place as far as I could go from where I work without an insane commute. 40 mins from the city and the last stop on the extended metro which I sometimes use to save on gas. We have thought of moving further away or maybe save money if we live deep in the BAD areas of town for $500 less a month.

I moved in with my partner who also lost her job during our last move and then subsequently (3 days later) got a bad case of Bell’s Palsy and was unable to find a job until it partially healed 7-8 months later. 

She started a stable job as a food runner a month and a half ago and brings in an extra $2000 a month into our finances.

No car payments but insurance is around $200 a month. Health insurance is $285 a month and $20 for my ADD medication every month. 
Groceries for me and my partner around $500 a month. $25 cellphone payment, $40-$50 a month for cat food, $125-$150 in gas a month, and I live as frugally as I possibly can. 

We don’t go out, we cook everything, we don’t do morning coffee runs (make our own), we don’t have amazon prime or any streaming service (Streamio is a beautiful thing) besides Spotify, I do all the car work myself on both our cars, I have a 3D printer so a lot of our interior decor and organizers, etc… are 3D printed to save money. I either make or repair most things we have.

Which leaves me with $400-$500 a month in disposable income, which can vary if I miss even one day of work a month. I usually use this for lunch ($4 wendys, $20 a week when I don’t bring lunch) and other misc things. 

Plus the approx. $2000 a month my partner makes. She has started to give me $900 a month for rent and I have $120 in checking and $900 in my savings after paying the rent this month.

My credit score is 530s

How the hell do I tackle this? Is bankruptcy the best answer here? My partner is fully willing to pool her income as necessary, she only has ~$1000 in CC debt. 

Where do I go from here?

1p9wpn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1p9wpn9/where_the_trees_turn_red/,Where The Trees Turn Red,"Some say it marched out of the sea under a bloody moon, here to expel our town of all hope - a monster to punish the naive prospectors of Maple Oaks who spent their gold on false witch hunts; an avenger of the young women burnt at the pyre, drowning the land for rebirth. Others say it was summoned within the forest, rendering a body of shimmering water an ancient gateway. Not a monster, but a deity from a far-off pantheon to be used as a tool for occult ambition. It brought unrivalled life and good fortune to the woods and its creatures, warping the trees into divine guardians.

I think it was just a man. An affluent founder who built our mines, our port, and, over time, fabricated fables around his locale, concocting utter, fictitious folklore bullshit with the natives that would live on through a local museum.

And his descendants would follow suit, using fiction to hide the truth.

For most of the history class of '85, such fiction ended there - ambitious nonsense about our home's origin, with awe-inspiring malarky attached.

But for Ebony.

Oh, sweet, perfect Ebony.

A switch had flipped in her mind, and an obsession with uncovering the town's secrets had taken hold. Some ancient remnant of this 'thing', whatever it was, must linger somewhere out there, in the woods or across the shore.

Legends need some grain of truth, right?

As the sheriff's daughter, Ebony had every resource and privilege any eager sixteen-year-old could need to hunt local myths.

But, for as keen as she was, her father still set borders. Go dig up the beach and explore the woods, that's fine. But don't go too far out, don't go at night; don't go alone if it can be helped. And, like any spoiled rotten teenager, Ebony ignored all parental guidelines.

This was her quest; she was invincible.

Under the guise of the moonlight, 2 days after she hadn't returned home, by the oldest lake, they allegedly found her slumping out of the ground from where she'd buried herself in a burrow. Her legs were clawed-up and gnarled, her clothes torn, her body broken; whether she had tried to dig herself to safety after being attacked by wolves, or they came upon her while she was unearthing the mystery that lay under the dirt, remained unknown.

For a time.

'Rules' began soon after the story broke, enforced by a grief-stricken sheriff. Beyond a threshold, the woods are forbidden. Period. Yet it didn't prevent whimsical boys and girls from investigating the tantalising, freshly rumoured legend whispered quickly through the halls: Ebony's ghost haunts the forest.

Go at night, go to the lake, and you'll see the distraught phantom of a girl literally killed by her curiosity - still trying to uncover her mystery.

So they instilled a curfew. As the sun dips behind those looming, timeless hills, notoriously unkind officers of the law patrol the streets to ensure no more wayward youths trek into the foliage. And for 30 years, for every family and every home, that same curfew has remained. For those same 30 years, Ebony's story has warped and demented itself beyond recognition as another generation learns of our nocturnal, ritualistic tradition; as another generation questions what she thought she'd found to warrant wandering that far into the wild, in the dead of night. Had she seen anything at all? Or, alone in the woods, had *something* found her, and if so... was it still out there?

I was a part of the latest generation, absorbed by the gospel of the potentially abducted, lured, murdered, raped, cult-recruited, tree-fucking, or whatever sort of stupid girl she was 3 decades ago that made nightly outings impossible.

I was a child when I first truly noticed the odd, sacred hush that descended over our home - my tyke brain finally acknowledging that our life wasn't typical.

""Inside Autumn. Light's getting low."" Dad had called from the porch as the sun began its lazy bleed into the mountains.

I sat in the kitchen, swaying on a stool, as my usually chipper mother locked every door and drew every blind, offering an occasional peek into the dark - her lips pressed and her eyes narrow as her stoic husband stared at the clock.

""Think they'll hit the street early again?"" He asked her.

""Not likely.""

Confused, I asked them both, ""What're you talking about?""

My father looked at me, understanding that his little girl was now sentient enough to question what he found familiar, while Mom continued her routine checks.

""Come here, kiddo,"" he said, ushering me to join him by a window. ""I'll show you.""

Through the curtain, I saw porch lights flicker awake down the street. Neighbours called or forced their kids home with a frantic sharpness, and then, way off up the road towards town, the low growl of a car engine began - silent red and blue and purple headlights weaved between the trees, reflecting off closed windows where curious eyes met it.

""See that car? The lights?"" Dad asked.

I nodded.

""A good, honest man drove one just like it... once. He kept people safe. Until one day, he lost someone very important to him.""

""Did he find them?"" I asked him, too young then to comprehend the cause of this rooted, collective script we recited.

A little lump formed in his throat. ""He did, but-"" He tossed the words around in his head. ""They'd uh... gone to Heaven.""

""Like Aunty?""

""Yeah-yeah, like... like Aunty. And soon after... he went to Heaven too. So now, that car and others like it, every night, carry on what he did.""

""Keep us safe?""

""Exactly. They keep us all safe.""

Mom muttered something profane to herself in the hallway; Dad, ignoring her, continued.

""But to do that, we gotta stay inside. They get grumpy if we get in their way. Understand?""

I nodded, slowly, as another voice spoke from the stairs.

""Do you see her?!"" Sean, my delinquent older brother, who noticed, questioned, and listened far more than I did, asked our Mom.

""*Sean*."" Mom hissed, finally satisfied that our home was secure. His eager eyes scanned the room until they met mine, and a wave of embarrassment washed over him.

""See who?"" I asked quickly.

Dad moved to block my vision as Mom yanked Sean to one side and spat harsh, but heartfelt whispers into his face. Peeking round his frame, I could see the two enter a heated argument of both passion and resentment.

Dad moved my face to meet his, ""You'll catch on when you're older, Autumn.""

And older, I became.

I would come to learn that evenings belonged to the woods and whatever they held, but in our house, that created more wonder than dread. Sure, there was an unspoken caution, a yoke around our necks, but my parents never pushed panic or horror. Instead, their warnings glimmered with something closer to mischief - something my brother adopted far more than I did growing up.

As the routines were finalised, and I came of age, Mom would click the kettle, and Dad would lean back in his chair to recount stories he called 'old myths'. Stories of monsters from the sea and of Gods from the woods, and whatever other fables or fairytales he could remember.

Stories Ebony had told him, before she became one herself - a naive adventurer found half-buried in the earth.

Sometimes, I'd catch a glance between my parents - sharing knowledge, a private joke or insight once hovering beyond my reach.

They'd known her. They'd shared classes. They'd snuck out to go drinking in parks and smoke joints by the lighthouse long after dark.

They'd loved her.

And by God, they missed her - fascinated and frustrated and mortified by her decisions that night that shaped our town into what shaped us.

Sean started to keep a notebook, scribbling down half-remembered details, little theories of his own, the finales of stories that never felt quite finished. I thought it was silly, that he was becoming too obsessed like Mom and Dad's 'ghost friend', but I begged to hear more as much as he did. We'd crack Dad occasionally, and he'd spin a fresh version of some local, rumoured phenomenon or woodland oddity, and Mom would roll her eyes with a hesitant smile tugging at her mouth.

They never pretended to have all the answers, and they never pretended that it didn't frighten them or that the fate of their friend troubled them most nights, but they offered pieces - fostering a hunger in their children to fit them, maybe, one day, together.

But that hunger would starve.

When Sean became a young man, and I became a teenager, we were wise enough to sense what they were too careful to admit. This 'curiosity' would always be expecting, always listening, for answers that would never come - a puzzle left eternally unsolved - because... we *still* had a curfew to respect, we still had rules; a tradition to honour.

Be curious to your heart's content. Explore the parts of the woods where you are allowed during the day, before you reach the barbed fences. But there are borders - don't go too far out, don't go alone if it can be helped, and don't even think for a second about leaving the house at night, let alone going there. And like the good, well-raised children we were, as our curiosity grew bored - but never bored enough - we respected those borders.

Until the one night we didn't.

Until the one night I would tear my skin through bramble and feel dirt fester under my nails, warm blood on my face, and understand what it was that dwelled out there - nesting among crimson trees so foul... and so beautiful.

\-

The daytime brought its own rhythm, and outside our fortress, life moved with the familiar patterns of any town. College was an odd blend of comfort and absurdity. My crowd - a strange, but functional little crew - made such a blend bearable, and sometimes enjoyable.

There was Barney, with his bottomless backpack of books and anxious, bashful heart; always armed with some obscure pulp fiction wisdom or dusty trivia he'd dug up at 3 in the morning.

Kate, a brilliant, gothic dark cloud of sarcasm and wit, adorned in black lace and sharp eyeliner - drifting among us like a raven that had learned to tolerate pigeons. She liked to draw. A myriad of dreamlike monsters filled her sketchbook, asphyxiating me whenever I saw them, as did the wonder that could rarely leave her mouth.

Arthur, trouble on two legs, adored by every teacher he infuriated and the first to disrupt a lecture hall; a cocky shit who always found ways to get us into places we shouldn't be (excluding one obvious exception). Detentions were a weekly event with him, yet somehow, he was the charming glue that held us together in our worst moments.

And finally, me, a theatrical ginger dweeb of fluffy sweaters and radiating rambles.

A four-pointed lopsided constellation, bright in our own humble little orbit.

But then there was an occasional black hole that made its rounds, from a very, *very* different universe.

*Willow.*

She never drifted to our tables during lunch or lingered in the hallways with us. No, she floated above it all. Self-proclaimed queen bee of this backwater nowhere, daughter of the wealthiest family for miles, founder of a circle of vixens and jocks who were always on the edge of danger. If she raised an eyebrow, the room would shiver; if she snapped her fingers, doors opened.

Worse still, she was the white-haired devil whispering sweet nothings into Sean's ear, encouraging my brother to abandon all of his rules and barriers on half-baked promises.

She was not our friend. Being noticed by her was a curse, not a blessing. Her name was poison in our household, detested by our parents - many arguments spawned from the mention of her alone.

But on one afternoon, in the buzzing cafeteria of flickering lights, scraping trays and pockets of laughter, she strode in alone. I was halfway through listening to Arthur tease Barney about the disaster of a date he'd had when, for only a heartbeat, the room fell out of focus as the cafeteria door banged against the wall, damning us into silence, and in she marched - absent of her salivating little wolf pack, licking at her heels and beckoning to her every word.

Her runway-ready, head-turning miniskirts and white leather jackets were gone, replaced by baggy sweatpants and an obscenely large hoodie, the sleeves swallowing her hands. She looked and moved like... well, the rest of us for once.

And her face - Jesus, her face. No canvas of pristine makeup could hide the ugly, angry, blossoming blotch of red and purple bruising that nested under her eye.

Every soul stared as their queen, out of place in her kingdom, made her way to an empty corner table with her head ducked and shoulders hunched. For those precious few minutes, she was just another girl - battered, tired and alone - threatening to vanish into smoke if someone so much as called her name.

And painfully, achingly slowly, the room soon returned to normalcy as its new corner-bound husk lurked at the edges of our vision - something to gossip about.

Barney kept sneaking nervous glances, bewildered at the sigh. ""Snowflake's looking rough today, huh?"" He whispered. ""Who'd you think she annoyed?""

Kate arched a brow, sketchbook balanced on her lap, pretending not to look. ""Maybe her cult of plastic witches turned on her. Looking like shit does suit her, though,"" she muttered with a flick of her pencil.

Arthur leaned in with a grin. ""Or she *finally* ran her mouth at someone who doesn't care who her daddy is... and can throw a mean punch.""

Surprisingly, I found myself just feeling sorry for her. ""Everyone has a bad day,"" I said, not sure if I actually believed it or wished someone would say that about me if I ever sported a glistening shiner under my eye.

Arthur gave a low snort. ""Yeah, you're absolutely right, Autumn. But not a cunt like her.""

Kate then nudged my arm. ""She's looking at you, by the way.""

Those words sent a prickle across the back of my neck. I timidly looked over and, true to Kate's word, Willow was staring at me from her exiled corner, her hood suffocating her face. A silence choked our table and, for a moment, time itself seemed to slow. The cafeteria and its occupants fuzzed away, and all that existed was the space between us. Then she lifted her hand, and a single dior finger curled out from under her sleeve, demanding me to approach with a tiny, effortless motion - one that sent a shiver down my spine and threatened to drag me away from the safety net of my friends.

I shook my head, and the sounds of the room returned.

Arthur snapped his fingers in front of my face. ""Hello? You still with us?""

His voice was peripheral, diluted. Their concerned faces were smudges as they shot bewitching glances over at Willow.

*Willow?*

Willow wanted me.

Barney reached for my arm as I pushed back my chair, mouth full of food. ""Don't! Let her sit by herself.""

Kate, never one to sugarcoat, muttered, ""Yeah, sit down, Autumn. Don't be your brother,"" all while sketching a hollow-staring shade in the margins of her book.

Even Arthur dropped his usual act, scooting to try and block my path, smug grin gone. ""Dude, are you good?""

I wanted to listen, really. I wanted to stay in our planted little pond and laugh at in-jokes. But her eyes dragged me - practically led me on a leash - and I understood then how she could've charmed my resilient brother. Fuck, even looking like crap, she was mystic, humming in my veins while my better judgment screamed to shut her out. I barely noticed my body moving as I weaved around disappointed hands and disgruntled groans and sighs. Logic was gone. Whatever she wanted, whatever grim story she had, I had to know.

And so I let myself hopelessly drift to her table, into her dark mercy.

She glanced at me as I reached her, her bruised face near-unreadable, and then gave her attention to the divided room of interested and uninterested onlookers alike. No one was close enough to eavesdrop.

""Autumn, right?"" She beamed as I took a seat. ""Sean's sister?""

""Who did that to you?""

She didn't answer right away, just shifted, hiding herself even deeper in the folds of her hoodie. I could almost see her weighing in her mind how much to say. Her eyes then snapped to a shape coming closer, dragging a chair in its wake. I didn't need to look to see who it was as an unstoppable surge of confidence came over me.

""Was it your dad?"" Sean pressed, seemingly having manifested out of nowhere, knuckles twitching, eyes flicking over the bruising. He looked over his shoulder at my confused, relieved table of watching friends, offering them a wave and a reassuring smile.

Willow's laugh was a short, bitter burst. ""Oh, please, he wishes he were that brave. No, I just... fell.""

""Was it Ben? You overstepped?""

She paused and then nodded slowly.

""You've been seeing him without me?"" Sean asked.

""You haven’t?""

""Who's Ben?"" I chimed in.

The two looked at me, as if remembering I was there, and suddenly I felt like a little girl in my parents' kitchen again.

""Local press,"" Sean said. ""Red hair, built like a stick-"" he nodded grimly towards his damsel, ""-and the one who encourages this diva to believe she's above tradition.""

My stomach churned. ""You've been out there?! What, at night?!"" I tried not to sound desperate, but the words pathetically dribbled out.

A fowl grin stretched across her mouth. ""I told you she'd be keen."" She said to Sean.

I almost hissed at my brother. ""You too?! After everything Mom and Dad-""

""I've not even left the house *once*, Autumn... I promise.""

""Is that right?"" Willow teased.

""*Yes*."" He spat, pleads and warnings written all over his face. ""And try as you might, nothing you or that *alcoholic* says will change my mind."" He then ruffled my hair, pausing the racing curiosity that began to rush through my head. ""Or yours, I hope.""

Willow's gaze then met mine and held it. ""Y'know, I've heard things out there. You can come listen too if you're not scared-""

Sean planted a firm, but hesitant hand on the table and stood with a huff. ""Catch you later, Wills. Always a pleasure.""

""Oh, come on."" She pouted. ""I won't take her past the fences; even I'm not that stupid... well, maybe just a few feet. We could all go together, the three of us!"" Her voice was thin and cold, but beneath all the bravado, I could tell she was terrified.

The word left my mouth before I could stop it. ""When?""

Sean was quick to usher me away from the table with nought a word, like my life depended on it. Willow watched us the whole time, smiling from ear to ear with the utmost joy.

""Back to your friends, kiddo. Now.""

""I don't... why'd I-""

""*Autumn. Now.""*

I nodded, slowly, and made my way back to my sanctuary as Sean reclaimed his seat in the lion's den. Whatever they said to each other was lost to me, but they remained a pair until the bell rang. His affection became more visible - tucking a hair behind her ear, cupping her hand, all while staring ditzy daggers into her.

The rest of the afternoon was a blur. My friends hounded me, prying me with questions about what Willow wanted, what she'd said, what my brother had said, what the two of them 'were', and why in God's name I'd actually approached her. I deflected, lied, kept quiet - anything to keep them away. Yet their pestering was nothing compared to what the recesses of my own mind were doing to me.

I replayed every word of that conversation and, through it all, one name kept cycling around.

'Ben'

A man who could solve the unsolvable puzzle my parents had harmlessly planted in me.

By the final bell, I couldn't bear it any longer, and I folded. I confided in them everything I was thinking and feeling - another rant bubbling out of my mouth in disjointed sentences that, somehow, they could understand every word of.

Arthur proposed it first, stabbing a straw into his milkshake, after we'd escaped the spilling sea of student-filled halls - clambering their way outside to enjoy the rest of their afternoon - and sought refuge in a cafe booth.

""Why don't we pay him a visit?"" He took a long gulp of some vanilla delight. The others looked at him like he'd killed someone.

""Visit the jittery reporter who punched Willow in the face?"" Barney asked, digging into a slice of red velvet. ""What could go wrong?""

""Well, either that or we break curfew ourselves and let this one,"" Kate began, poking me in the ribs, almost spilling my tea, ""scratch her itch.""

""It's not an... 'itch', Kate.""

""Oh, sorry. Unresolved compulsion then?""

""Hey, back off."" Arthur butted in, and I almost thanked him, until I saw the look on his face. ""It's not her fault she got hypnotised by that white-haired bitch.""

They laughed at my expense; the stupidity, the absurdity of it all. And I did too.

Barney pushed his glasses up. ""Have you considered another outlet? Like, read a book-""

""Or get laid.""

""Or write music!"" Kate seemed exceptionally excited about her own idea. ""I can already picture your first single: 'I Was Found Dead In The Woods At 16'.""

""You guys suck.""

""No we don't.""

Arthur clasped his hands together. ""Anyway! Suggestion still stands: we visit this guy.""

Barney groaned, ""I don't know, man... Mom would always say-""

""Ugh, your Mom says *anything*, Barn. And it ain't up to you, right boss?""

The three of them looked at me: Arthur, eager and giddy; Kate, curious and cautious; Barney, frightened and shaking his head. Was I really going to drag them along to a far-off part of town to question a man I'd never met about local legends and parental bedtime stories, all storming from the unsettling words a girl (none of us liked) had given me?

Of course I was.

\-

The local press office was a rundown, narrow building wedged between a dead laundromat and a fading convenience store - its red brick hull stained dark by years of rain and grime. Dusty, crowded windows made it impossible to see inside, weeds poked through the cracked pavement, and the front door barely held itself together on worn hinges.

""Yeah, no thanks."" Barney squeaked, turning on his heel and walking away before Arthur tugged him back by his ear.

Kate inspected the building, eyeing it up and down like a piece of abstract art. ""Did your brother mention *why* he or Willow talked to this guy?""

""Nope.""

""Marvellous.""

I didn't bother with knocking; I strode right up to the door and stepped inside.

Beyond an unmanned reception, a few desks packed the room - piled high with yellowed notepads, sticky notes and old newspapers. The stink of old coffee, cheap booze, and burnt rubber attacked my nose as I ventured into the rioting clutter. My boots scuffed against the fading floor as a fly buzzed in circles over an empty mug.

""Hello?!"" I called.

No answer.

Kate gagged as she and the others filtered in behind me. ""Ew-fuck. It smells like someone died in here.""

Arthur slapped a cracked counter, fluttering a bundle of papers into the air. ""Perfect. I'm ready to see a ghost, how about y'all?""

""You're more likely to see rats, Arthur."" She added, trailing a finger over a dusty desk, painting lines and shapes.

I found myself drawn to a wall of photographs - a timeline of the town's many faded celebrations and events, but nothing stood out. No mention of our town intertwined with a grand fate; no mention of a lost name.

Barney, at first, hung back - overwhelmed by the smell and disorder. But even he soon found himself drawn in, and he shuffled over to a cramped bookshelf, overflowing with almanacks and faded paperbacks. ""Guys,"" he cried, peering down at the floor, ""come take a look at this.""

We gathered around, not knowing this would be the pivot point, as Barney stared at thin, dark streaks scarring along the floor, half-hidden under the shelf. Arthur's hands immediately flew to its sides, and, with a grunt, he tugged hard. The unit groaned but didn't move. I chose to feel along the edge instead, searching for - there. My fingers brushed a catch beneath the lowest shelf. A soft click sounded, and the whole unit lurched, swinging open on hinges to reveal a dark staircase - stretching down into the guts of the building.

""Oh, God no,"" Barney whispered, with a tiny hint of uncharacteristic thrill.

""You fucking found it, dork,"" Kate said. ""What're you complaining about?""

""And oh, God, *yes*, you mean?"" Arthur joked, eyes sparkling. ""Ladies first."" He then added, gesturing for me to take the first step.

I hesitated, only for a moment, before taking the first cautious step into the shadows with a shit-eating smile on my face.

So quick. So easy. Far, far too easy. No time to savour the anticipation; awe eclipsed every worry, every rational thought, as the adventure unfolded before us. I soaked myself in the thrills, each of my nerves shot with reckless curiosity, not once stopping to ask questions.

It spat us out into a large, sweltering room washed in a sickly, red glow. The stink of alcohol was more pungent down here, wafting through the stale air. Strings of thumbtacks and curling, ancient photographs lined the walls: a blurry picture of an old lake, a crowd at a festival, an evening shot of a rich, starry sky; figures vanishing behind trees, snapshots of a distant woods bathed in purple light, wide-eyed faces from decade-old yearbooks.

A lair adorned with the collections of a private investigator.

Dilapidated, torn pieces of archived newspaper were neatly lined on tables, screaming local tragedies, accompanied by police forms, council records and government files that had almost bled dry of ink - margins etched with hastily scribbled notes. A cold knot formed in the pit of my stomach as my eyes darted over them. Shut away relics of decades past leapt from the pages and clamped themselves to my chest. They should've just been old stories, forgotten pains, but arranged together, they became an accusation.

'Search For Missing Hiker Continues'

'Police Abandons Search For Missing Son - Family Left Without Answers'

'Search For Missing Girl Continues'

'History Repeats? Another Youth Vanishes Near Old Mines'

'Strange Lights Spotted By Shoreline!'

'Search Continues For Missing Dog'

Dozens of absent resolutions; the words began absorbing together.

'*Search Continues*...'

Fucking search continues, search continues, search continues!

No remains discovered, nothing discovered, nothing e*ver* discovered, no one ever found, no bodies found.

Not even one.

I felt something rising in my throat I couldn't explain. The others had joined me around the table, reading the headlines we'd never known existed in silence, their faces tightening.

A myriad of unspeakable, unanswered losses mouldering for at least 50 years.

This was no adventure; this was a warning.

Did Mom and Dad know?

'Local Sheriff Disappears - Foul Play Suspected'

'Community Divided Over Nighttime Curfew'

'Who Is Enforcing The New Rules? Authorities Silent!'

Kate drifted away from the crowded table and let her attention settle on a map. ""Autumn!"" I ripped myself away, leaving Arthur and Barney to sift through more paper galore. The map was one of the woods (of course), riddled with illegible scrawls and red markings noting boundaries, but what had her focus was an old calendar taped to the corner - days crossed in black marker pen, others circled and annotated with different, tidier hands.

Willow's name was infrequent enough to spot.

And so was Sean's.

My fingers zipped over clustered markings, piecing together how specific dates lined with shaded areas on the map. They'd been charting, beyond the fences, but there was a threshold that even they hadn't dared cross.

That changed tonight.

The air pressed in, and I couldn't breathe. I steadied myself on the edge of a table - shaking, head spinning, heart pounding like a kick drum in my chest. I didn't know what I wanted to find here, but this was *not* it. Distant and muffled, their voices reached me and drew me back; a hand on the shoulder with some grounding words. Arthur said a joke, I think, Barney muttered something soft, and Kate held my hand - it wasn't grand, there was no fanfare, but it was enough.

When I could finally speak again, it came out in a croak. ""What do we do?"" The question hung heavy in the air. Too many options: go to the police (and tell them what?), go to my parents (and be put in solitary?)... or-

Arthur spoke as if reading my mind. ""We could go to the woods.""

""Not a chance!"" Barney whined. ""I've not even... *been* to the fences, none of us have; I'm not going there. And it's bear season-""

Kate couldn't believe what she heard. ""Bears?"" She gestured to the room we stood in. ""That's your biggest worry?... *Bears?* Not the fact that we'll likely vanish into fucking-*""*

""Guys!"" I shouted, for what felt like the first time in years. ""Can we... not argue, please?"" I then looked at Arthur. ""Get a picture of that map.""

Barney shrivelled up into himself. ""No, we can't-""

Kate punched him in the shoulder. ""We can, and we are.""

Retracing our steps, we slipped back up the cracking staircase one by one. Behind the battered front door, afternoon had already begun its dwindling descent into dusk. I don't remember what we said to each other as we fumbled back out onto the street - making and questioning plans in the span of seconds - but I do remember who stood waiting for us.

Sean leaned against the hood of his car, arms crossed, jaw tight. When our eyes met, he opened the passenger door and gave a single, sharp commanding nod to the seat.

No one spoke.

Kate kept looking between us; Arthur bristled; Barney gulped, fidgeting with his pack.

I eventually forced out a small, wavering smile as a revolting, impulsive thought overtook me. Perhaps it *really* was an adventure, a quest... but it wasn't theirs. ""Maybe we just go home and sleep on it instead. Clear our heads.""

""Not a chance."" Arthur pressed quietly.

""Arthur, it's late and I'm tired. I'll text you when I'm home. Promise."" I lied.

""Are you sure?"" Kate asked slowly.

I nodded, and she, unsatisfied, painstakingly gathered the others to start their walks home.

But Arthur lingered. ""See you tomorrow."" He said, more like a demand than a farewell.

Even Barney showed some resistance, but they soon trailed off, leaving me on a darkening street.

I slid into the passenger seat beside my silent brother, and the car door shut with a heavy finality.

He watched my friends round a corner before he spoke. ""Do you want to go home?""

His question slowed the whirling storm in my head. The idea of home - its warm, routine 'normalcy' - comforted me. But it did not scratch gnawing itches. I stared out the window, watching slivers of sunlight begin to hide behind the trees.

""No.""

Sean felt his jacket and produced his little, rugged notebook - its edges worn by years of restless fingers. ""Last chance.""

""I'm sure.""

He managed a comforting smile. ""Okay.""

He put the car in drive, and we took off down the street.

\-

He navigated us through tucked-away, less-travelled roads before the scouts began their patrol, until we reached the town's edge. The car rolled to a stop in an abandoned parking lot infested with pine needles, the depth of the woods just looming beyond a bygone footpath.

At a threshold, the tall, stark black shapes of thick, barbed metal fences, stretching for at least an acre and far higher than any man, tried to ward us away from the wild maw they quarantined.

Not tonight.

Two figures waited beneath a flickering, dying light: Willow, and Ben - red-haired, rail-thin, and staggering slightly on light feet.

Sean killed the engine. A bird called from the trees as he made his way out of the car and towards his crew. I followed tightly behind, not sure what to feel, as Willow offered a happy wave while Ben's rickety fingers twisted around a heavy, military flashlight.

""Who's this?"" He nearly slurred out.

Willow answered before Sean could open his mouth. ""His sister.""

""Huh. Impeccable timing, kid.""

An anxious energy came over Sean. ""Hey, so, maybe we don't go as far-"" he pointed down at me, the pathetic, nervous weight almost attached to his hip.

Ben laughed. ""Don't be getting cold feet, Seany-boy, now you got a tag-along.""

Willow laughed too, and I pretended not to spot the tremble in her lip.

Sean rested a firm grip on my shoulder. ""We'll turn back if you find it too much, okay?""

""Heads up!"" Ben warned, as a stream of red, blue and purple lights danced over a hill and made their way down towards the lot.

We were gone by the time they found Sean's car.

Crunching over brittle grass, we snaked through the woods until we reached the monolith. It seemed flimsy up close, a patchwork of tired metal smeared with rust and graffiti, and dead, segmented searchlights adorning the tops. They found the gap easily - a ragged hole crudely carved into the sheet metal, its rim twisted and sharp.

One by one, we slipped through, and my haste earned a few cuts along my sweater.

For a mile, we pushed deeper in total silence - broken only by a clumsy step and a shiver in the wind. I caught glimpses of little 'X's' marked on some trees and rocks, as the path became rougher, revealing themselves when flashlight cones stroked over them.

I saw a 'W + S' carved into one maple tree, cuddled in a love heart.

Willow's voice nearly scared my skin off. ""Listen.""

Something changed - the voiding silence, gradually, warped into a series of coarse, pained echoing croaks originating from somewhere far, far ahead in the dark. The wind scratched and rattled its way through wounded, cracked bark as my ears strained and every instinct wailed at me to turn around and run.

My brother took my hand instead. And we continued.

""What is that?"" I asked.

""No idea."" Was all he could say.

Night fully settled over the woods, the moon and the stars obscured by dense trees. I couldn't tell how much further we walked or for how long.

I checked my phone.

Dead. Impossible.

Sean noticed. ""Hope you messaged Arthur.""

I hadn't. *Shit*.

Before I could think, we came upon a still, unmoving river stream - flashlights glimmering across the shallow, black water's surface. The three of them stopped. This must've been the edge of their familiarity.

Ben charged forward, producing a polaroid camera from a satchel. It was evident from the way he walked that his courage came from a bottle. I wondered briefly what kind of war waged in his head, as Willow went to follow him.

Sean stopped her. ""We could leave him to it. He'll tell us anyway, whether we're with him or not.""

Willow let out a tiny laugh. ""You want what I want, right?"" Then she looked at me. ""Having fun yet?"" She broke away from him and followed the bobbing head of red hair into the breach.

Sean sighed, hesitant to follow.

""I'm not scared."" I blurted out.

""I know, but-""

I watched sense and reason come over him in a single moment. It hit me, too.

What the *fuck* were we doing?

It lasted only a second; this lucid cut into the adventure, telling us to go home. Then, just as quickly, gleeful shouts and exclamations pulled us effortlessly onwards.

Several meters beyond the river, one tree stood apart - a towering sentinel marred by something uncanny. A crimson mould covered its bark in thick, shulking veins, twisting and threading through its grooves like a cancer. The colour was impossibly rich, both disgusting and hypnotic, and the texture looked more like a synthetic glass.

Then it pulsed, dimly. A faint red glow breathed to life within the mould, slow and steady, synchronised... to the slow rhythm of a heartbeat.

Willow was beside herself as Ben snapped a picture of the growth. Then he touched it.

The mould trembled and released a cloud of faint, powdery spores into the air, which quickly scattered. A single red vein at the root of the tree flared to life, pulsating with more luscious light. It stretched along the ground - its visibility was a complete defiance of logic, as if the earth itself was translucent. The vein bent deeper into the woods.

Like sheep, we followed.

Every single tree was consumed in the same, lurid mass - shimmering in unusual palettes of red and garnet - some far more infected than others. Even the floor was terraformed by the stuff, puffing at our feet. The pulsing lights grew brighter as thick, euphoric fogs drifted among the trunks, sweet and dizzying and as the haze settled... the lights revealed a truth.

Silhouettes - human and animal both - curled, fetal and motionless, were encased and suspended within the bodies of the trees themselves.

""We should... probably leave,"" Sean said, dreary and sheepish. ""Tell someone.""

I cannot explain why Ben chose to rush one of the trees, tearing desperately at the mould in a panicked bid to save the person imprisoned within.

I *can* explain how the forest responded.

The ground convulsed and split open, revealing worming interconnected tunnels beneath us, and a gangling *thing* emerged out at horrifying speed. Its towering, sharp humanoid body was woven of the same pulsing red mould, and it moved with an unnatural, sinewy grace as it mercilessly lunged towards Ben.

It ripped him apart in seconds, splattering us as his flesh tore and bones snapped, his screams lost beneath the swelling, heart-throb of the woods.

The adventure was over. This was a nightmare.

In the chaos and horror, a jolt of raw clarity rushed through me - my vision sharpened, and the soft charm of the woods lifted as I held my breath. I became pitifully aware of the creature's sounds as it clicked and hissed, feeling and searching around its vicinity.

It had no face.

No ears, no eyes, no mouth.

It moved in tandem with the mould's pulse.

Sean came to the same conclusion I did as his hand found mine. He reached into the folds of his jacket and threw his notebook as far as his arm would allow. The creature spasmed and dove to where it landed, clawing and tearing into the ground, shredding the bundle of leather and paper.

Sean's other hand found Willow's, silent and stiff. And we ran.

It was a desperate flight back through the woods, Sean's grip fierce as the monster splintered and retched after us - each step we took triggered a poof of blood-red light to burst from the mould, guiding the thing to us. Every stumble, every cut and scrape, every gasp seemed to vibrate the air as it pursued, tracking our every pace, tireless and quick, but just far away enough.

Then we splashed over the river.

I spun back to see it halt amidst the thicket, shaking, uncertain, its senses dulled - the network of mould beneath it had almost broken. Then it gagged and yelped as the ground opened again, reclaiming its soldier.

The silent trudge back felt much shorter than the journey in.

As we reached the hole in the fence, a searing flash of purple light erupted around us, obliterating the dark. Out of the blur, stern men in dark suits swarmed forward, barking muted commands. They swept us up, herded us away from the woods - no explanation, just tight grips and hurried steps and lights drilled into my eyes.

It was numbing.

Everything passed like a shutter click: the lights, the door, the engine of a police car, the sirens, the walk up my porch. My parents, wild with terror, embraced Sean and me with questions spilling out of their mouths, but all I could do was collapse into their arms, unable to look them in the eye.

My bedroom has never felt this cold; this quiet.

There are slashes up my sleeves and across my hands, my knees are scraped, a gash is across my leg, and I think some of Ben's blood is stained in my eye.

No.

No, no pain pulses in my temples. Not mine; not entirely unpleasant.

I think my brother feels the same.

I see it when I close my eyes.

Not a monster from the sea, nor a God from the woods, nor a ghost girl by a lake.

Just mould. A beautiful, red mass, and a warm tree to rest my head.

Half of me is convinced to grab some kerosene and a match.

The other is a compulsion to go again.

I can go deeper, further. Much, *much* further.

Maybe I'll bring my friends.

Why can't it be their adventure, too?",7,1764442574.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I said ok, it would be great exposure being sent out in an email to 15000 realtors, and being at the event representing my business. This was last thursday. The event was this past thursday. We planned coffee for monday to go through everything more. I was sent a sample email which was later deleted and was never sent the actual invite email. So i had about 2 hours to copy everything from the email before it was deleted and I then had no info about it. So the guy ghosted me, ignored my emails, texts, calls. Yesterday (day after event) he scheduled a zoom call. I was expecting an explanation but he actually just wanted to ""fill me in on how the event went"".

I’ve been trying to acquire an SMB for a while now. The process was brutal—my morning routine consisted of coffee and manually clicking through BizBuySell, LoopNet, and about a dozen niche broker sites.

I realized I was missing deals because I couldn't check 500+ sites fast enough, and the good ones (especially on smaller broker sites) disappear instantly.

I’m a bit of a tech nerd, so I decided to build a ""digital assistant"" called BizScout to automate the scraping. It scans the web, filters by NAICS/EBITDA, and just emails me the matches.

I figured other searchers here might be dealing with the same ""tab fatigue,"" so I polished it up for public use.

I’d love to hear your thoughts on the interface or if there are specific niche sites I should add to the crawler.

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction!

1p9whxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1p9whxk/i_fell_into_a_pile_of_bones_while_hunting/,I Fell into a Pile of Bones While Hunting,"This year for deer season I decided to take a camping trip. There were originally going to be four of us going, but various responsibilities and/or excuses left me as the only one going. My girlfriend didn’t love the idea of me being alone in the woods for a weekend but I assured her I could handle it. My PTO had already been approved, so I may as well get paid to stay out in the woods and get away from the world for a while. 



I was very familiar with the area I was going to be hunting, I had been camping in those woods since before I could drive. My friend Shane’s grandfather had passed it down to him before he died. . It was a few hundred acres in the Ozark mountains, mostly woods as his grandpa hadn’t been able to keep up with the family farm in his old age. I met his grandpa, Alan, before he died. He always warned us to be careful when we went out in the woods and made us stop back by his house on our way out so he knew we came out safe. I always thought it was a little excessive but I can’t fault the old guy for keeping track of us. The rest of the family had little to no interest in maintaining the farm, so the farm died with Alan. 



We had gone camping a few times a year all throughout high school until college and work pulled us all away. The lower areas were all cedar glades, but if you managed to make it up high enough the glades broke and gave way to old growth oak and pine trees. Years ago I had decided that our grand camping spot would be on the very top of one of these hills. It was a good two mile hike up an old trail that led to a hunting stand they had built recently enough that it was still safe to use. The ground leveled out and we had all the firewood we could ever burn, though whoever was assigned firewood duty usually got sick of sawing through white oak within the first hour of being there.



Many cold nights were spent at the top of that hill sitting around a warm fire. We would spend hours trying to scare each other with stories of deer speaking in dead family members’ voices, unexplored caves, a demented woman that ran through the woods with a knife - anything we could come up with to make each other’s, or our own, skin crawl. In the later years at least one of us would bring weed that turned any rustle in the night into a blood thirsty monster that would surely come eat us as soon as we let our guard down.



Long story long, I knew the area well enough to be comfortable on my own for a short hunting trip. I made the hike to the top of the hill and settled into our old stomping grounds. We were the only ones that ever came up here so the campsite was exactly as we had left it, just under a couple of years worth of leaf litter. I was glad to find a decent amount of firewood left over from our last trip. I had no one else to pawn the firewood duty off to, though I suppose I had it coming since I would always find some other definitely important task to busy myself with instead of breaking down the firewood. Despite being alone, it felt remarkably like old times. We had made our campsite quite homey over the years. I built saw horses and tripods to hang our obnoxiously heavy dutch oven over the fire, even ran a ridge line to hang a lantern from. All of the modern amenities you would expect to find two miles out in the woods,



Unfortunately for me, this year’s rifle season started unseasonably warm. I had decided that the deer weren’t going to be coming to me in the stand so I figured I would explore and just maybe find the deer on the way. I had been told stories of a cave so full of silver ore it would make Shane’s family the wealthiest in the state. I had absolutely no interest in finding a Nutty Putty Cave of my own so I decided that any holes in the ground were off limits. The woman that ran through the woods with a knife was surely just a story Shane’s mom had told us when we were kids to get us back in the house in time for dinner. I was also reasonably sure there were no wendigo, sasquatch, chupacabra, or any other creature of the night to be found. It felt like these woods had lost all of their mysticism and wonder as I had gotten older. Fantastical or not, it felt good to be back.



My first day was entirely uneventful. By the time I had camp set up I didn’t have enough daylight to explore very far. I retired to the camp, boiled some water for ramen noodles (a delicacy for a group of kids so loud they scared every small game animal away for a mile), and crawled into the tent for the night.



The next morning, I decided I was going to spend most of the day away from camp. After fixing breakfast and drinking entirely too much cowboy coffee, I collected and processed all the firewood I would need for the night and set out. I left late in the morning, giving myself plenty of daylight to explore under. After an hour or so I found a pond I had never seen, and an old rusty hunting stand nearby. A pile of bones sat near the stand, it was surely a deer that had been picked clean by the coyotes. I didn’t dare climb up into the decades old, tetanus riddled death trap. Most of the rungs of the ladder were already gone anyway. I sat down in front of it for an hour and a half to watch the pond. I saw some small game and birds but no deer. A squirrel would taste better than the food I had brought, but the 30-06 I was hunting with wouldn’t leave much squirrel to eat.



I moved on from the pond, venturing further into uncharted territory. Uncharted for me anyway. Time had made the brush so thick I sounded like a building collapsing every step I took. After spending way too long on the fool’s errand of “sneaking” through the brambles and thorns, I turned back. The sun had gotten lower than I had realized. I hadn’t quite gotten used to daylight savings time. It was 4 o'clock already. I would have to hoof it to get back to camp before it was pitch black. The low for the night was 60 so freezing to death wasn't a concern. Getting hopelessly lost in the dark was.



In the fading light, I could see the pond and the old rusty stand again. I had my bearings again and calmed down. I passed right by the old stand where I had sat earlier. What I didn’t see was the piece of metal that tripped me. I tumbled to the ground but didn’t hurt myself. I did manage to land right square in the middle of that deer skeleton I saw earlier in the day. In the dim light showing through the trees, I could see what looked like a leather-bound notebook in the mess of leaves and bones. Alan must’ve dropped it up here before he died. I picked myself up, grabbed the notebook, kept walking toward camp.



I made it to camp just as it got totally dark, the faint embers of the morning’s fire drawing me in like a moth to a burnt out campfire. I stoked the fire back to life, glad to feel its warmth. The chill of the night had set in in the sun’s absence and I was dressed for walking around on a warm day. I made another cup of coffee, warmed up my rations for the night and cracked the singular beer I had brought. All was well and good in the world once again. 



After a couple of hours of watching the fire I remembered the book I found when I tripped earlier. With a lantern hanging above me and the fire I had just enough light to read under. The journal was old, the pages cracked between my fingers and were reluctant to separate. It was a wonder it had survived out in the weather as long as it had. It was a personal journal. As best as I could tell, it belonged to Shane’s great-grandfather, Harlan. I recognized a couple of names I saw and a few locations too. Entries included his wedding on July 10th 1942, buying the property, starting the farm, and raising a family in the late 1940’s. He wrote often about the things that brought him joy, specifically his wife and son.



In his words, 



	“There’s not a day that goes by that I don’t thank God for bringing me home from Japan and putting Eleanor in my life. I wasn’t worthy of either and here I am.”



“The best day of my life was the day I married Eleanor. The second best was today, We welcomed our boy Alan into this world. He looks just like his mother. Good thing, too, she’s the one with the good looks.”



 It was sweet. I was glad I found it. Harlan had mapped out nearly every inch of the property in great detail. I found the hunting stand and the pond, even the area where we’d built camp 70 years after him. He wrote about setting up the very stand I found and excitedly bringing fresh meat back to his family. There wasn’t mention of a motherlode mine or anything fantastical, but was a cool find none the less.



After hours of pouring over the journal I was more and more amazed by the old book. It was an autobiography of 15 years of this man’s life. I felt somehow connected to him, having been close with his family for most of my life and spending so much time on his land all these years later. I couldn’t wait to show Shane his great grandfather’s journal. The last few entries, however, did not tell a happy story. The previously ornate handwriting and colorful writing became shaky and blunt. The last few pages are as follows:



“November 13th, 1948

	First day of huntin season is tomorrow. I believe this will be the last year I hunt alone. Alan’s gettin big enough to come hunting and I reckon I’ll spend the next year teachin him to shoot. Might even get him his own gun for his 6th birthday in April. He sure does love when I come home with a deer. He’s taken after me, his favorite part is the tail. I’m a little tore up to give up the best part but I don’t mind sharin with him. He has his mother’s smile. That alone is worth it.”



“November 14th, 1948

	Just got out to the stand. Been seein plenty of bucks this fall. Should probably see one before too long. I’ll be glad to have food for the winter. Our hog got sick and keeled over before we could butcher him. We’ll about go hungry if I don’t bring home a deer. 

	

	I put a good shot in one. Gonna give him time to die before I get down.”



It was here when the writing changed.



“Rung broke under my foot. Hit the ground pretty hard. My legs went numb when I came to. Think my back’s broke. Don’t reckon I can drag myself home. Eleanor’s in no shape to come lookin, got her leg caught in the gate shifting cattle. Alan’s 5. Too young.

Pain shoots like lightning when I move.

Midday now. Pain’s workin its way up back. Can’t hardly take a breath. Gonna be below freezing tonight.

Sun’s goin down. Cold’s bitin right through my clothes. The top half anyway. Can’t feel below my waist.

Can’t seem to find my pack where my lighter is. Must have hung it at the top of the stand or flung it when I went down. 

The cold’s got me in its jaws. If I make it through the night I’ll try to crawl out tomorrow.



November 15th, 1948

	Coyotes came overnight. Scared em off for a while but they were stubborn. Gun didn’t fall off the stand. Woulda shot them or myself if I could. They wore me out. Knawed me off to the knee. Least I didn’t feel it. I think they’re froze otherwise I’d have bled out by now. 

	Been a day now, Don’t reckon anyone’s comin for me.

 Snow started fallin at some point. Funniest thing, I got warmed up and the shivering stopped. Back quit hurtin too. Hands ain’t workin too good so I guess I’m about done writin. Think I’ll sleep for a while then go see Eleanor and Alan.”



I think I'll pack up camp in the morning and head back down the hill. I’ll leave the book with Shane. ",3,1764442061.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

So far I've only used store-bought ground coffee, and I'm starting to get good results with it. I have a small grinder I originally bought for grinding seeds, so I wanted to try buying coffee beans and grind them myself. I have a few questions:

- How do you decide when the beans are ground fine enough?

- How do you know how many beans to grind for a single pot?

- How do you know when a brew is done? I stop when I no longer have a continuous flow, but with my 6-cup pot that happens when I still have about half the water on the lower part of the pot.

And kind of related:

- My stove's smallest burner is bigger than my pots. A friend of mine can make me a converter plate but needs the measurements. I wanted to have one with the same diameter and thickness as [the Bialetti](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KS4TJZZ?th=1). I see the diameter is about 140mm, but I can't see the thickness anywhere, how much is it?

After almost a decade of being the considerate, loyal, “ride-or-die” friend… I finally realized I deserve people who are just as genuine. 

I’m 25, has old soul energy and I value authenticity more than anything. I prefer friends who show up because they truly want to, not because they need something. I’m tired of fake energy, empty promises and being disappointed by people who can’t give the same effort back. 😔

So I’m putting myself out here again , hopefully for the last time and to look for mature and real friends. I’d love to have someone I can talk to, play online games with, grab a coffee with, or chill over a beer.

About me:
• 5’3
• Shy at first (pero kalog pag tumagal, promise 😭)  
• Decent, respectful, and not into drama  
• Loves K-pop, anime, gaming, coffee shops, traveling, and chill people

Is he genuinely respectful or just avoiding the 'work'?,"I (23F) met a guy (29M) on Bumble. We went out for the 1st time to a bar, the 2nd time for coffee. Then he invited me to walk in the park and go to his house to watch a movie, but he canceled at the last minute and ghosted me for a month. I was very sad, and after a month, I sent a message asking, 'Wanna come over and watch Netflix and chill?' He agreed and a few days later came to my apartment and spent 3 hours there. He wanted sex and asked me to masturbate him, but I didn't. Three days later, he invited me to his house to 'watch Netflix and chill,' and I went. We kissed, and he asked to finger or masturbate me, and I said, 'I've never had sex before,' and he said, 'Omg, I'm not taking your virginity.' He kept kissing me, took off his clothes, and said, 'That's not a bad thing,' referring to my virginity.

When we went to his bed, we were naked, and he kept touching my vagina. After that, I masturbated him, and he ejaculated on my hand. We lay naked and hugged, and he told me that losing your virginity 'it has to be something meaningful' and told me that his ex had sex with him without telling him she was a virgin at the time, and he didn't like it. He also said he regretted the way he lost his virginity. He told me 'You're gorgeous, I mean it' a few times and said 'It will happen' after I told him I was 23 and wanted to have sex soon. It seems like he only said that because he felt sorry for me. And when he said 'It will happen,' it almost sounded like he was saying he was going to leave that 'job' for another man, but I don't know, I just thought that.


A few times I asked him if he still wanted to take my virginity, and he replied, 'Not today,' and I thought that was a soft lie and that he was actually not interested. I also asked him, 'Don't you wanna kiss me anymore?' And he said, 'Of course I wanna kiss you.' I sat on his lap, rubbing my vagina against his penis, and told him I wanted to have sex with him, and he said something about noticing that. After that, he told me he was going to pay for an Uber for me to go home, and I said, 'Why are you doing this?'
And he said, 'I'm not a bad guy, I'm a good guy, and I'm trying to do the right thing. You come here to see me, and am I supposed to leave you on the street in the cold waiting for the bus? No.' I hugged him when we were saying goodbye, I said, 'Thank you for everything,' and he said, 'Kiss me,' and I kissed him, got in the Uber, and left. 

I messaged him the next day saying this: 'Good morning! I got home safely last night. Thank you again for the evening and for the Uber :) I had a great time with you.' And he replied saying: 'Your welcome :) I was happy too. I had a great time with you too.'

After one day, I sent him this message: 'If you ever want to chill and watch something again, just tell me,' and he hasn't replied and ghosted me. What do I do now? What message should I send him? Did he not have sex with me because he thought I didn't want to, or because he didn't want the hassle of 'breaking my hymen'? Please help me. I just wanted to have sex with him, and I don't know what to do. I don't care if he doesn't want anything serious with me; I like him a lot, and I want to have sex with him.

Is it okay if I send one more message in a few days or a week, asking him if he wants to 'Come over and watch Netflix and Chill'? Despite the ghosting, my only intention is to hook up with him again, make out with him, and go to bed with him. What do you advise me to do if, in this case, I want to try to have sex with him? If I insist a bit more, will he reply? The other time he ghosted me, he replied after I offered him Netflix and Chill.""",2,1764441814.0,ghosting,5,1.0,False

1p9wcfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1p9wcfo/is_he_really_obsessed_or_am_i_exaggerating/,Is he really obsessed or am I exaggerating?,"
Hello everyone, 
I (21f) had a friendship with a guy last year. I am not even sure if we can call it a friendship. 
So for some context, I am an international student in Germany, however this guy is Dutch and he lives&studies in NL. Our cities are close, only 25 mins drive. 
First time we hangout he kissed me, we almost slept together but at the end we both realized that we did not like each other in that way. We decided to be friends.

We were mostly texting online, however I used to go to his city to go on dates, he would ask me about it and he was suggesting to meetup sometimes, but I did not want since he was not a stable person. I only went over to his place only 2 times after our first hanging out. One time he was upset and I even bought him coffee and food to cheer him up. 

We would talk about religion, history, dating and etc. He told me fee times that he feels asexual and he is not sure about his sexuality. He would also open up to me about his family issues, I would listen. He was severely depressed and honestly I was as well, so that is why I kept talking to him.

However then I realized that he is trying to put me down a lot. He would call me ugly, unattractive and a lot of racist slurs since I was not blonde or Western. He would tell me that I am only made of boobs and that is why men talk to me. I would always say okay and act non-chalant, but the ropes got broken when he wished me d*ath because of my ethnicity. 

He said it was a joke but I was so done with his bullshit that I blocked him from everywhere, however he would make new snapchat accounts and try to talk to me. He was blocked from number, instagram and his regular snapchat. Honestly I was a bit creeped out by him, because one time when I went on a date with a guy from his town, I got a scary text from an anonymous account with my full name and adress. I believe that he could have seen me with a guy and try to mess with me via scaring me. But I never had the proof that it was him.  Also, he would crash out really bad if I had a good date with someone. One time a guy bought me flowers and he demanded his pictures, told me the guy is probably crazy because Western men do not care about women and they do not pay for dates or buy flowers. 

Anyways, Yesterday again, I got a request. It was him. He asked me how I am, if I am still around. I was not angry at him anymore, so I just responded normal. 

Then he asked me If I am dating, I said no. He answered “lol”. Then he told me a bit more about his studies, that he wants to switch bla bla. Then he told me he is going to delete the account. 

I am really confused. What does this guy actually want from me? Is he really obsessed or am I exaggerating?

1p9wbqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1p9wbqu/what_receipt_scanner_app_do_you_actually_use_for/,What receipt scanner app do you actually use for tracking expenses ?,"I'm trying to get better organized with my spending and need a good receipt scanner app.

**The Problem:**

I'm terrible at keeping track of receipts. They either fade (gas stations are the worst), get lost, or end up as random photos buried in my camera roll. Last tax season I probably left $1,000+ in deductions on the table because I couldn't prove my work-related expenses.

**What I've Tried:**

**Phone camera + Google Drive:** Too manual. If it takes effort, I don't do it consistently
**Keeping physical receipts:** Half of them are blank from fading by tax time
**Expensify free trial:** Seemed good but $15/month felt expensive for personal use

**What I Need:**

Accurate OCR (pulls merchant name, date, total, tax automatically)
Easy categorization (work vs. personal, or by expense type)
Cloud backup (don't want to lose everything if phone dies)
Export to PDF or Excel for my accountant
Clean interface without constant upsells
Reasonably priced (ideally under $10/month, or free if possible)

**My Use Case:**

Self-employed with home office and business expenses
Need to track work-related purchases for tax deductions
Also want to see where my personal spending actually goes (eating out adds up fast apparently)

**Specific Situations I Struggle With:**

Gas station receipts that fade to blank paper within weeks
Coffee shop/lunch receipts I forget to save
Online purchases where confirmation emails get buried
Remembering to scan receipts before throwing them away

**My Question:**

What receipt scanner app do you actually use in real life that works well?
I see a ton of options (Expensify, Shoeboxed, Receipts by Wave, etc.) but it's hard to tell from marketing which ones are actually worth it.
Looking for real user experience, not reviews from the app's website.

Thanks in advance!

For the last few months I'm working on an idea to create an app which connect nearby companion who share similar interest. It's not a dating app. I am positioning it as a booking app where you can sell yourself for your interests. 

A few examples:
1. One fine Sunday evening, if you just want to go for a walk or a coffee, but if you don't want to go alone, you can book a companion of your interests nearby you to go. 
2. If you're skillful in any area like chess, pickle ball, guitar etc., you looking for a companion you can go and book. 
3. It's upto you how you want to sell yourself (skill, interests, travel, fun, or date), but once booking is done people can rate you and give comment about your vibe. 
4. Additionally, you can chat and share your meeting photos in the gallery section. 

Hourly rates depend anywhere between 49-999 depends on your booking preference.

1p9waeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1p9waeu/what_does_he_want/,What does he want?,"Hello everyone, 
I (21f) had a friendship with a guy last year. I am not even sure if we can call it a friendship. 
So for some context, I am an international student in Germany, however this guy is Dutch and he lives&studies in NL. Our cities are close, only 25 mins drive. 
First time we hangout he kissed me, we almost slept together but at the end we both realized that we did not like each other in that way. We decided to be friends.

We were mostly texting online, however I used to go to his city to go on dates, he would ask me about it and he was suggesting to meetup sometimes, but I did not want since he was not a stable person. I only went over to his place only 2 times after our first hanging out. One time he was upset and I even bought him coffee and food to cheer him up. 

We would talk about religion, history, dating and etc. He told me fee times that he feels asexual and he is not sure about his sexuality. He would also open up to me about his family issues, I would listen. He was severely depressed and honestly I was as well, so that is why I kept talking to him.

However then I realized that he is trying to put me down a lot. He would call me ugly, unattractive and a lot of racist slurs since I was not blonde or Western. He would tell me that I am only made of boobs and that is why men talk to me. I would always say okay and act non-chalant, but the ropes got broken when he wished me d*ath because of my ethnicity. 

He said it was a joke but I was so done with his bullshit that I blocked him from everywhere, however he would make new snapchat accounts and try to talk to me. He was blocked from number, instagram and his regular snapchat. Honestly I was a bit creeped out by him, because one time when I went on a date with a guy from his town, I got a scary text from an anonymous account with my full name and adress. I believe that he could have seen me with a guy and try to mess with me via scaring me. But I never had the proof that it was him. Also, he would crash out really bad if I had a good date with someone. One time a guy bought me flowers and he demanded his pictures, told me the guy is probably crazy because Western men do not care about women and they do not pay for dates or buy flowers. 

Anyways, Yesterday again, I got a request. It was him. He asked me how I am, if I am still around. I was not angry at him anymore, so I just responded normal. 

Then he asked me If I am dating, I said no. He answered “lol”. Then he told me a bit more about his studies, that he wants to switch bla bla. Then he told me he is going to delete the account. 

I am really confused. What does this guy actually want from me?

My mom always told me my dad was the cause of the divorce. When I met my now-fiancé at 16 and saw how healthy families act, I started realizing something was off.

At 18 she repeatedly forced me to text my dad threatening to sue him over “late child support.” Years later I learned that actually she cheated constantly, had a previous husband, left me and my sister alone while she was with other men. 

When I entered university, she claimed she “couldn’t afford” my semesters, even though she always had money for cigarettes, coffee, sweets, and new clothes. In Bulgaria full-time students normally don’t work, but I had to start doing 12-hour shifts to pay for everything myself and told my father to stop sending the child support money because I haven't once gotten anything from them and he said that he knew my mom took all the money for herself but he kept paying so she wouldn't harass me. By my final year, studying alone without support was too much, and I dropped out. She still lies to people and tells them I graduated because we ( me and sis) are ""always better than her friend's children.""

I took care of my grandmother when she needed (hospital stays, recovery). My grandma cooks for her and constantly gives her money. And although she provided my basic needs growing up,  I realized that she was emotionally manipulative, guilt-tripping, and always the victim.

I’ve lived with my fiancé since I was 20. My mom now has a looong list of physical and psychological issues and refuses to go out alone (agoraphobia). She expects me to handle everything - hospitals, errands, speaking for her, etc. 
When she was unemployed, I paid her bills and even bought food for her cat for years. Now that I’m unemployed, she hasn’t once asked if I’m okay or if I even have money. She just expects me to drop everything for her. And honestly… these are just some of the things that annoy me.

Every time she calls, I get anxiety. I just want to live my own life without being guilt-tripped into being her permanent caretaker. We had a heated argument yesterday, me telling her that she needs to be more independent, that I won't always be next to her and she said ""when you both needed treatments and support I was there with you, now it's time you take care of me. You both are ungrateful, I don't want to hear from you anymore"". Me and sis have chronic issues but she is a mother, like...that was her responsibility.

Like I said she spends all her money on unnecessary things and doesn't have a single penny in her saving account - she doesn't intend to help us with the wedding, nor with our children that we will have in the future...nothing. Has anyone felt this way, how do you cope. I get that she's my mother, but I need a personal life, she calls every single day and if I don't pick up she gets all frustrated - ""it could have been an emergency, you haven't seen me in three days, and don't ask how I am"" etc. What can I do?

He was 30, and I was 19 when it began. I was previously sexually abused by a teacher, plus my family was emotionally absent, so I already had issues like being attracted to older ppl, getting overly attached to ppl who show me love, and so on. He knew I wasn't doing great at the time and he would explicitly ask me to trust him with my secrets/ problems.

Basically, the guy was working as a driver for our family. We chatted in the car a lot, and he was the one to initiate conversations. Then I kinda started to get overly attached to him (again due to family issues). We chatted the whole time he drove me somewhere. Then he started to invite me for coffee and even paid for me. That went on for a long while. I was starting to spend a lot of time in the car, just doing random errands. I was not in a great place at that time mentally but tried not to focus on it. I think it might have influenced my (horrible) decisions. He went on holidays with us to drive us around. I would stay at home when he would too, so we could spend time together (nothing sexual was going on). he would join me to make puzzles together, or to play video games. He would sit close to me, and when my parents would be passing by he would move farther away so they wouldn't notice. I would sometimes initiate sitting closer to him as well, and come and find him myself. I do feel gross about it now, but I was addicted. like, nothing mattered apart from spending time with him. 

Sometimes he would be angry at me because I would want to go somewhere, and my mom would ask him to drive me. He would be mad at me for ruining his day. I would grow extremely upset and all, but later he would come over and say that it's all good. He didn't touch me in any sexual way, only small gestures, but it felt very very sexual/ off. Like touching hands, slapping me as a joke, sitting close to me, hugging, saying that he cares for me a lot, asking me to sit in the front (I usually sit behind), and secretly taking me out to cafes. He would comfort me when i would argue with my mom. he would tell me to keep it secret. Sometimes he ignored me on purpose and pretended i was nothing to him. i would grow extremely depressed at those times. 

I have no idea if what was going on was my fault. i was not underage anymore, so maybe in my case its me getting into a situationship-like story and it ending badly.  I dont know.  pls dont judge but say the truth. i get that i might be to blame.

This triggered a whole conversation about what makes a particular pan dulce good vs not very good. We were specifically discussing the concha.

I like mine very light and fluffy with lots of sugar topping. She said she liked hers more dense. All the better to quickly dip into her coffee.

Then we started talking about our favorite vs our least favorite. For me, my favorite is the (cinnamon?) concha and my least favorite are empanadas, regardless of flavor. She said her favorite was the pumpkin empanada and her least favorite is the yellow cake with pink frosting. I told her I can’t believe we’ve been friends for almost 40 years, and I didn’t know she was a basic pan dulce bitch. She said **I** for the concha.

So here are my symptoms: 

Now I know no one here is a doctor but its nice to hear others side of a similar issue I have. 

-Bleeding but only after going 
-No pain 
-No cramping
-Minor to accute itching 

The bleeding only last for a few moments then stops until I go again. I think the longest issue i had lasted for more than 4 days. I am a coffee drinker and I have been working on pushing more water and fiber and I do use topical stuff like aquaphore and preparation H. I kinda know what irritates my problem and ive made the adjustments/done what ive read online. But the online stuff can be scary to read and I do have anixety and get in my own head with all the stuff out there. I tend to feel like im experiencing those scary symptoms that point towards more serious issues. These issues dont put a stop on my life and I can live normally. 

So, advice time! 

What do you guys do to help with reoccurring bouts of this issue? 

How do you guys manage your stress during your flare ups/episodes? 

Should I consult my doctor about what to do/get a referral for a GI doctor? Or should I continue to make more lifestyle changes?

[TL;DR: Working from a café has become the best part of my routine because of all the warm, interesting, everyday-life moments happening around me.]

For the longest time I never really saw myself as a coffee shop person. But one day I went there just to shake things up a bit, and before I knew it, the place became part of my routine.

I’m 33M and in the process of setting up my own company, so until I get my own office, this café has basically become my workspace. And honestly, it has turned into something surprisingly wholesome.

When you sit in the same spot every day, you start noticing these small slices of life around you. I keep seeing new faces, familiar faces, tiny moments, little stories. It adds a kind of warmth to the day.

There is a newly divorced woman in her mid thirties who comes in with a soft smile and steady energy. She was telling her story to a date one day, and it felt like watching someone gently step back into life.

Then there is a 24 year old girl who comes in with a different date each week. Before her date arrives, she is always on her phone, smiling at her screen. It’s cute, almost like watching a rom-com unfold in real time.

Couples walk in with all kinds of vibes. 
Some sit quietly and just enjoy each other’s presence. Some can’t stop exchanging those warm, lovey glances. Some are clearly figuring out the early stages of something new.

There is a girl in her early twenties who orders a hot chocolate and journals for hours. She creates this peaceful little bubble around herself that somehow spreads to the whole room. 

Then there are uncles in their 50’s with their thick financial books sometimes excel sheets talking about everything under the sun. Stocks, music, women, life. All in one conversation.

And then there are the gym bros in vests and flashy shoes who act super casual while checking out every person who walks in. They are unintentionally hilarious and somehow complete the ecosystem of this place.

All these little moments together create this warm, lively atmosphere. It feels like everyone is just finding their own rhythm. Some are building something. Some are relaxing. Some are reconnecting with themselves. And being around all of that gives the day a really pleasant vibe.

Working from this café has made life feel a bit fuller. And as someone who usually keeps to himself, it feels nice to be surrounded by people again, without any pressure to talk or interact. Just existing around others and watching life happen has become a surprisingly good part of my day.

I don't really know how to describe myself, but I enjoy going to the gym, swimming, art, crafts, literature, films, travel, learning about history. I don't have many friends due to poor mental health but I am trying to change that. I am an ally of the LGBTQ community. I'm down to hang out, get coffee, go partying, go to a concert, try a new activity like ice skating or rollerskating, try a different cuisine. If any of that interests you send me a message 😊 

I would like to make female or NB friends (no offence intended). Just to be clear my intention here is to make friends, not for dating.

I am also not good at texting so purely online friendships don't really work for me. I would prefer to meet someone who is open to hanging out in person.",1,1764440119.0,MakeFriendsInIreland,0,1.0,False
