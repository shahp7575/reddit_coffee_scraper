Unfortunately when I tell you that I have not had the opportunity to talk to him in person, I mean it! Our paths just never cross. He’s on the worship team and he’s busy so I understand. A couple months ago I worked up the courage to send him a DM and ask him out. It was a simple message and all he could’ve said was no or yes. He didn’t respond or even open my message to my knowledge. I’m not naïve and I’m pretty sure everyone sees when they get a message through Instagram bc you get the notification or you see the message request right? Whatever though, I gave him the benefit of the doubt and I lived with the crippling awkwardness that I felt afterwards, but I let it go. I hoped this crush would go away or that he would approach me in person, but it never happened. I gave it a couple months and I decided again to try my luck. I sent him a nice DM trying to introduce myself over coffee. It’s been 24 hours and he has not responded. I’m too chicken to see if he’s even read the message. The thing is I don’t even care if he rejects me! I would rather someone reject me than not respond at all. It takes a lot of courage to reach out to someone and express interest, and I’m wondering why or if it’s wrong for me to believe that people should at least have the decency to respond to someone’s message. Again, I’m totally OK with rejection. I just think it sucks how in today’s culture it’s okay to just ignore someone’s message. I mean in person if someone ask you on a date, you don’t just say nothing and walk away you respond politely or impolitely whatever it may be. It really sucks and it honestly makes me feel less confident to do it again in the future online or in person :/ ",2,1765872569.0,ChristianDating,1,1.0,False
1pnwkkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCAT/comments/1pnwkkt/advice_to_students_and_parents/,Advice to Students and parents,"Hi
I accompanied my daughter to the university MMI yesterday and spent time in the reception area while about 20 students waited for their interviews. Many had parents with them, and the atmosphere was incredibly tense.

Students were coping with the stress in different ways. Some chatted quietly with their parents….while others sat alone with visibly trembling hands….. A few were rehearsing answers looking in to notes… and several were practicing MMI scenarios with their parents reading from bunch of notes….. What struck me most was that only a couple of students were actually talking to each other.

I’m not a doctor or healthcare professional, but my piece of advice to parents and students..

- Students, Introduce yourself to the student sitting next to you. Ask them where they traveled from, or how they’re feeling about the day..: Having a conversation with another candidate helps distract you from your nervous thoughts and naturally calms your mind. It’s also excellent practice for the interview itself…. warming up socially helps you come across as more natural and personable when you walk into that room.


For parents, I’d encourage you to let your child connect with their fellow students… You grab a coffee and char with other parents.. At this point, they’re as prepared as they’re going to be. What they need now isn’t more rehearsal or another Q&A session—they need to relax, feel human, and remember that they can do this.

Best of luck 🤞

1pnwim9,https://i.redd.it/buqer51ysi7g1.png,Looking for link; The Betrayed Wife Who Came Back With No Mercy,"Chapter 1

Damien Valtieri had always disliked children. Right after we got married, he told me he never wanted kids.

Three years into our marriage, I accidentally found his vasectomy report.

Alongside it, I discovered the existence of his twins with another woman. The children were already four years old.

Like a bolt from the blue, the truth shattered everything. We had the worst argument ever.

Relatives and family friends tried to talk me down.

""It's rare that Damien is even willing to have a child now. Why make such a big deal out of it? The Valtieri Group needs an heir.""

""I'm sure the kids were an accident. Damien must've had no choice. Why not just treat them like adopted children?""

I looked at Damien with heartbreak in my chest. He was elegant and distant, radiating authority at thirty like a man born to rule.

""As long as you don't see them again,"" I said, ""I won't ask for a divorce. That's my bottom line.""

Damien stood up, took off his wedding ring slowly, and placed it on the coffee table.

""Diana carried my children for nine months. I'm their father. Taking care of them is my responsibility.""

""She doesn't threaten your place as Mrs. Valtieri. Why are you being so aggressive?""

Hearing him say something so cruel, I gave up the last hope of fixing what we had.

""In that case,"" I said, ""let's get a divorce.""

...

Bang! A cup slammed at my feet.

My father's face turned purple with rage as he pointed at me and shouted, ""You divorce him, and I'll break your legs!""

""Scandals happen in high society all the time. Why are you making such a scene?""

My mother-in-law stood up and held my father's arm, trying to calm him down. Her tone changed when she looked at me, filled with disapproval.

""Averie, you're a lady from a prestigious family. Why stoop to the level of some jealous woman from the bottom rung of society?""

""Look at the chaos you've caused. You're going to ruin the Valtieri family's reputation if this spreads.""

Everyone chimed in, trying to convince me to back down. Tears rolled down the back of my hand as I finally asked the one question that had been tearing at me.

""Damien, why did you get a vasectomy behind my back?""

Back then, we agreed to let nature take its course. If we had a child and he didn't want it, I would respect his decision.

I thought if something did happen, he might be moved. Maybe fatherhood would change his mind.

But for three years, I didn't get pregnant, not even once.

I thought it was me. I saw doctors, took traditional medicine for two full years. Turns out, it was because he had already had the procedure.

A flicker of guilt crossed Damien's face as he let out a long sigh.

""Averie, I didn't have a choice.""

Then he walked over and gently wrapped his arm around my shoulder, speaking earnestly.

""Diana came from nothing. She was bullied her whole life. How could she compete with someone like you, a Laurent heiress? How could her children ever compete with yours?""

""I just didn't want the kids to suffer the same way she did, being judged and humiliated by others.""

""Averie, we've known each other for twenty years. You should understand where I'm coming from.""

He spoke like everything he did was justified, like I should just accept it and understand his ""hard choices.""

All I felt was shock, like a tidal wave crashing through me.

So this was what it meant to love deeply.

He planned it all, step by step. Damien had done it.

I was just the sacrificial pawn for his ""true love.""

I pushed his arm away and took three steps back, staring at him with tears in my eyes.

""You really are shameless, Damien.""

""Let's get divorced. I don't want to share a bed with a traitor.""

Chapter 2

Damien's face stiffened for a second, then turned to irritation.

""Averie, we were born into privilege. Nothing is ever simple for us. Why can't you be more understanding?""

""You were born into a life of luxury. Diana will never have that. I gave you the title of Mrs. Valtieri, all the dignity that comes with it. She only wants to live a quiet life. Do you really have to force me to leave her?""

He turned to my father as he spoke, ""Sir, I don't want this to affect the partnership between our families. Take Averie home and talk some sense into her.""

He grabbed his car keys and walked out, taking my mother-in-law and everyone else with him. He even thoughtfully closed the door behind him.

The moment they left, my father exploded.

""You disgraceful girl! Have you embarrassed yourself enough? You're coming home so I can straighten you out. How did the Laurent family end up with someone like you, so rude and without class?""

I let out a cold laugh.

""Well, I guess it's bad genes. I'm not just rude, I'm selfish and heartless too.""

Let's not forget, this is the same man who kept a mistress, fathered two illegitimate kids, and drove my mother to suicide. I'm just getting a divorce, which is nothing compared to that.

My father's face turned red with shame and rage.

""You're just like your mother. Narrow-minded and foolish. You could've lived comfortably, but you'd rather stir up trouble?""

His voice dropped, eyes full of threat.

""Even if you don't care about yourself, think about Theo. He's in his final year of high school. Top of his class, every year. You want him to drop out now because of you?""

My heart sank, and I collapsed onto the couch.

He was right. I couldn't use my little brother's future as a bargaining chip. When our mother jumped off that building, he had just turned one.

He was so small, clinging to my fingers and smiling at me, not knowing he'd never see our mother again.

He was poisoned three times, bitten by a snake, hit by a car with enough force to break his ribs, and nearly died from a severe allergic reaction.

I fought for him with everything I had. I couldn't ruin his future now.

My father stormed off. When Damien returned later, he found me sitting on the floor, my face tear-streaked and drunk.

Without a word, he lifted me onto the couch and gently wiped my face with a towel.

He brought me lemon water, sat beside me, and helped me drink, one sip at a time.

For a moment, I thought I had traveled back eighteen years, to a time when he truly cared.

Back then, my mom had just passed away. My dad brought his mistress home and forced me to kneel and call her ""Mom.""

I hid in the attic and cried until I couldn't breathe.

Damien held me the same way then, gently wiping my face, helping me drink water.

He promised I wasn't alone, that I could trust him.

At thirteen, he even knelt in front of his own father to protect me. He secured a partnership just to prove I had value.

How could I not fall for a boy like that?

But the warmth of that memory faded as he sighed.

""Averie, I'm not leaving you. It was just one mistake.""

I held him tight and whispered, tears choking my voice.

""Damien, you know I can't handle this. I don't want to live like my mom did, drowning in pain.""

""Send them abroad, please. We can support them financially for the rest of their lives.""

""Why didn't you ask her to terminate the pregnancy? Why didn't you tell me when you decided you wanted kids?""

He was silent for a long time. Then he stood up and said coldly, ""The Valtieri-Laurent energy deal cuts the ribbon tomorrow. Get ready. Don't be absent. People will talk.""

I watched his tall figure walk away.

And in that moment, my heart sank completely, like a stone at the bottom of the sea.

Chapter 3

The next day, Damien sent over the finalized gown and the Queen's Necklace he'd purchased at auction in Merriden.

His assistant stood silently nearby, visibly nervous.

I stayed calm as I slipped into the dress and applied my makeup carefully, not letting my expression falter. Damien was right.

This partnership couldn't fall apart. My younger brother was still too young to stand on his own.

I had a responsibility to reclaim everything my grandfather left behind.

The ribbon-cutting ceremony was grand and extravagant. Crestwick's elite had gathered in full force.

As I stepped through the gates of the estate, I was stunned to see Diana Vale there as well.

She wore a pale silver gown, styled for Western elegance but clearly evoking grace and warmth, her demeanor glowing with maternal softness.

Damien had his arm around her waist as they mingled with guests, and Diana smiled politely, every movement calculated and refined.

His mother was cuddling her grandchild, surrounded by a group of wealthy socialites who cooed over the baby's round cheeks and full forehead, praising him as a child born for greatness.

The moment I walked into the hall, the air shifted. Conversations faded, and every pair of eyes turned to me.

Damien released Diana without hesitation and walked toward me with a composed expression.

""Averie, come take a look at the baby. He's really adorable,"" he said casually, taking my hand and leading me to his mother's side. Then he handed the baby over to me.

As I held the soft, chubby little boy in my arms, an ache rose in my chest. I gently brushed his cheek with my finger.

If only he were mine. I could've had this too.

Around us, the crowd watched with mixed expressions, some sympathetic, others mocking, most indifferent.

Diana pushed through the crowd with urgency in her steps. ""Averie, he's heavy. Let me take him back.""

I froze. My eyes widened in disbelief. ""What did you call him?""

""Damien named him Martin Valtieri,"" she said with a smile. ""It means the two of us are forever connected.""

A loud cry pierced the room. My arms went limp.

I felt myself falling into an endless void, swallowed by a cold so sharp it cut through bone.

He gave the name we chose together to someone else? He wanted to be connected to her, forever?

That name, Martin, was something we came up with on my eighteenth birthday, the night I gave myself to him for the first time.

He had held me tight and whispered that when we had a child, we'd name him Martin, because it meant our hearts would always be connected.

Before I could even unleash my fury, the sound of a slap echoed through the hall. My head snapped around.

The baby had fallen. Blood trickled from his tiny forehead. Damien was holding him tightly now, his face contorted in anger as he glared at me.

Nearby, Diana burst into sobs so sharp they tore at the silence.

""Averie, even if you don't like my child, you can't throw him like that in front of everyone! He's Damien's son too. How can you be so cruel?""

She clutched at the baby desperately.

""Damien, let me go. I love you, I was willing to stay by your side without a name, without a title. But I can't risk my baby's life like this.""

""How could she do this to us? Just because I have no family doesn't mean she gets to hurt my son in public!""

Diana wept as though her heart had been shattered, while Damien panicked, rushing to comfort her and the still-crying child.

""Diana, look at me. Martin is our child. I swear I won't let anyone hurt either of you. I love you. I love him. I'll protect you both with my life.""

He held her and the baby as if nothing else in the world mattered. ""Don't worry, I'll make sure she apologizes to you. She'll kneel and beg your forgiveness. Whatever you need, I'll make it happen.""

Each word from Damien stabbed me like a knife. He wanted me to kneel and apologize... to the mistress?

What about the promises he made me? Were they just lies?

The memory of his youthful eyes, bright and full of fire, flashed before me again and again.

""Averie, I love you. I'll protect you for the rest of your life. If anyone dares to hurt you, I'll fight them.""

But now, Damien yanked me by the collar and shoved me toward Diana.

""Kneel. Apologize to Diana and Martin.""

He leaned down, his voice low and cruel. ""Swear on your dead mother's name that if you ever dare act out of jealousy again or try to harm Diana and her child, your mother will never find peace in the afterlife.""

I stared at him in horror. My mother had treated him like a son before she passed. I remembered how he knelt at her grave, calling her ""Mom"" over and over.

Now, just for the sake of his mistress, he was cursing her soul?

I wiped away my tears and stood tall.

""Damien, I will never kneel and apologize to a homewrecker. Not unless I'm dead.""

Damien's eyes narrowed.

He waved his hand, and the bodyguards stepped forward. One of them slammed a knee into the back of mine. I collapsed onto the ground in front of Diana.

Before I could bow my head, the room erupted in whispers.

""Seriously? The heiress of the Laurent Group just knelt in front of a mistress. How humiliating for all women.""

""She should've just disappeared. This is beyond embarrassing. If her father were alive to see this, he'd die all over again.""

I raised my head, eyes burning with fury. I looked straight at Damien.

""How could you forget the vows we made under that tree?""

Damien's expression darkened. He grabbed my jaw roughly.

""Averie, I haven't forgotten anything. You're the one who kept pushing and trying to drive Diana and our child away. You need to be taught a lesson today.""

Then he slammed my head against the marble floor. Blood dripped from my forehead and blurred my vision.

Chapter 4

Damien pushed my head down, forcing me toward the floor for a second kowtow, when a thin figure rushed in and threw a punch straight into his face.

""Don't touch Averie.""

Through my blurred vision, I saw my younger brother, Theo Laurent, trembling as he spread his arms wide to shield me.

Damien steadied himself, wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, and looked at Theo with a cold expression.

""Move.""

""I'm not moving.""

""Damien,"" Theo said, voice shaking with fury, ""you promised you'd protect Averie for the rest of her life. How could you make her kneel to that trashy woman?""

Damien's gaze narrowed as he replied in a low voice, ""Theo, you're young. You don't understand. I'm doing this for your sister, so she learns not to hurt people.""

""That's a lie. Averie would never hurt anyone. You're all framing her.""

""Damien, I'm eighteen now. I'm not a child anymore. If you won't protect my sister, I will.""

His young face was flushed with anger. He grabbed my wrist, ready to pull me away.

Damien raised his hand, and the bodyguards blocked our path.

""Averie, when you make a mistake, you take responsibility. You still haven't apologized to Diana.""

Theo shoved at the bodyguards in fury, only to be pinned down.

When he saw one of them grab my arm, his voice cracked as he shouted, ""Don't touch her. I'll apologize for her. You can yell at me or hit me, I don't care.""

Then he dropped to his knees with a heavy thud in front of Diana and bowed hard, over and over.

""I'll apologize for her. Please stop doing this to my sister. She's a woman. Don't humiliate her like this.""

Tears streamed down his face. My chest tightened. I kicked the bodyguard's leg, lunged forward, and pulled Theo into my arms.

""Theo, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. This is my fault.""

His tears rolled down my neck, burning my skin.

His voice was hoarse as he cried, ""Averie, I'm dragging you down. I'll quit school. Let's leave.""

People around us watched with complicated expressions.

Everyone in high society knew what had happened to the Laurent family, but no one ever brought it up. No one wanted to offend a business partner.

As the tension grew, my father stepped forward, face dark, voice sharp.

""Shame on both of you. You ruined a good day over jealousy. Utter disgrace.""

He slapped Theo hard across the head.

""You're a man. Instead of calming your sister down, you cause trouble with her. How are you supposed to run the Laurent Group someday? If you had even half your cousin's sense, I could die in peace.""

He lifted his hand again, but Damien's mother stepped in, her tone filled with false sympathy.

""Don't hit him. He grew up without a mother. Of course he doesn't know better. You can teach him slowly.""

Then she turned to Damien.

""Take Martin to the hospital and make sure there's no head injury.""

Diana rushed forward.

""Mom, the guests are still here. I'll take him myself. You stay and help Damien host. Don't delay anything important.""

She scooped up the child dramatically and hurried out.

Damien pulled her into an apologetic embrace.

""Diana, you're always so thoughtful and gracious. Thank you.""

She smiled sweetly.

""It's my duty as your wife. Take care of the guests. I'll call if anything happens.""

She left with the child in her arms.

My father immediately took Damien's arm and, facing the crowd, loudly announced their partnership. Damien took the microphone and declared that the Valtieri and Laurent families would forever support each other.

The guests applauded and mingled. I stood quietly in a corner, feeling nothing but bitterness.

Theo eventually dragged me to the hospital.

As we turned the corner, Diana walked toward us.

Her gaze landed on the gauze wrapped around my forehead, and all her fake gentleness disappeared. She lifted her chin proudly.

""Averie, now you know who Damien really loves.""

She leaned in and lowered her voice.

""We weren't some accident. Damien and I were together a year before you two got married. He only married you because he pitied you.""

""You know why he got a vasectomy? Because I asked him to. Marriage was fine, but he was not allowed to give you a child. Otherwise, I would have left. He wanted to keep me, so he got down on his knees and swore he'd never have a baby with you. Then he went straight to the clinic.""

She clicked her tongue, stepped back, and stared at me with naked hatred.

""Averie, the entire Valtieri Group will belong to Martin. Be smart and get out. Otherwise, you and Theo won't even have a place to be buried.""

She laughed loudly and strutted away.

When I saw Theo running toward me with the medicine, I took out my phone and dialed a familiar number.

""Adrian, I'm ready to go to Merriden. But I have one condition. You take care of Theo's future.""

His voice trembled with joy.

""Averie, you finally made up your mind. I'll arrange everything. I'll come pick you up tomorrow.""

1pnwfwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/PubTips/comments/1pnwfwl/qcrit_adult_science_fiction_what_keeps_the_stars/,[QCRIT] Adult Science Fiction - What Keeps the Stars Apart (75k/Third Attempt),"Hello! I am back with the third draft of a query letter for my first novel.

Dear Agent,

I am seeking representation for my 75,000 word science fiction novel *What Keeps the Stars Apart*. This novel combines galactic scale, several timelines, and multiple points of view with emotionally intimate prose and characters in a similar style to *The Vanished Birds* by Simon Jimenez while incorporating the apocalyptic stakes of *Stars and Bones* by Gareth L. Powell.

In the distant future, humanity has spread to hundreds of star systems, but it has been a slow crawl, the harsh limitation of the speed of light never having been circumvented. Civilizations under different suns go through their own crises and emerge—or perish—alone. Amir Younis is the Astronomer, one of the five academics crewing the Galactic History Preservation starship *Absolution*. The crew has drifted between the stars for thousands of years, waking from cryogenic fugue for a short time in each new system to fulfill their mission of recording humanity’s fragmented history in a continuous, interstellar narrative.

Now the crew approach a system where their records indicate an interplanetary civilization flourished mere thousands of years ago. Upon entering the system, the Astronomer’s probes report a complete apocalypse—unfortunate, but not unprecedented. But when the geological survey of the homeworld shows no record of anthropomorphic habitation anywhere in the planet’s deep past, the system evolves from a graveyard to a paradox. When the Astronomer next wakes, reports come in from other GHP teams of more desolated worlds; civilizations destroyed and all evidence of their existence erased. 

As the crew races to solve the mystery of the desolations before all of humanity is destroyed, they discover that their memories have been manipulated by the Psychologist—none of them can remember their pasts before the *Absolution*. Before the rest of the crew can confront the Psychologist, they find him dead by his own hand after succumbing to the horror of galactic annihilation. While the surviving crew works to recover humanity’s future and their own pasts, the Astronomer fears that remembering what they have to lose—and what they have already lost—will destroy them.

\[Bio/Personalization\]

Thank you for your consideration. 

Sincerely,

Name

**First 250 Words**

The Astronomer woke to silence. Right on cue, their cryogenic sleeping pod had initiated waking procedures as the *Absolution* decelerated into the Alpha-8457 star system. The rest of the crew still slept. The chance of pod failure was less than ten-thousand to one—it had to be—but still the Astronomer checked every one, running manual diagnostics each time. It was habit. When you spent thousands of years adrift in the emptiness between the stars, habit was all you had—that, and your crew. They all came back green. 

Everyone on a Galactic History Preservation team got used to traveling in cryosleep, but no one ever came to like it. If they did, the Astronomer thought, their psych profile should probably be reevaluated. A person taking the long nap was biologically almost dead, and they woke up feeling that way.

After the head, the Astronomer’s first stop was at the autodoc.

• Dose: 16g

• Water: 246g, 90C

• Grind: Medium-Coarse (95 clicks K6, true zero 5 clicks)

• 0:00 - Switch closed, 62g bloom

• 0:30 - Open switch, set aside, reset timer

• 0:00 - Switch closed, pour 184g

• 1:15  - Open switch, drawdown

• Add bloom to final cup to desired concentration

I ended up adding 15g of the bloom back in, there was about 25g total. Got all of the fruitiness of my first cup of this coffee with none of that harsher umami and acetic flavor present. Cup was a tad weaker than l’m used to so perhaps the ratio needs to be tightened up more or a bit less water used in the bloom.

Anyone else?","Bought the OXO on a whim wanting to know what the soup hype was about, and I've been having tons of fun with it. Super nice, intense drinks with much heavier body than pourover, but still with really nice clarity and very punchy acidity. I find myself reaching for it almost every day for a nice after dinner decaf, or just as a way to try good beans totally differently from my usual V60. It's currently my favorite way to have decaf especially, though. 

I know I've seen a few other people in here mention using this thing - I'd be curious to hear what recipes you've been using, and if you've had any beans with it that were particularly standout. For me, I've really enjoyed using it with punchier, slightly more process-forward beans. I just finished up a bag of September's decaf, Lollipop, that I really enjoyed as soup. The candy note was super strong in the smell, much more than pourover. I also tried a coferment from S&W, the peach one, and it was super fun. The fruit flavor was especially present, and while I detected some bitterness in those beans as a pourover, it was surprisingly less pronounced in the soup (or maybe just not as notable compared to the overall intensity, lol).

Worth mentioning I've also never tried a proper straight espresso, so my perspective on ""particularly strong coffee beverage"" might be slightly askew. I imagine if you were an espresso person trying soup, your perception of it would be pretty different than a pourover person trying soup. 

Anyway, didn't expect to ramble so long on this. Just curious who else in here is enjoying soup, and what you've enjoyed from it!

I think this one is a classic among men that we instantly think that a girl is flirting with us just because since she's been nice, since we're not used to that coming from a stranger.

Anyway I went yesterday to some health clinic and this girl took care of me and I don't know now if she was just being nice or also a bit flirty. Since I was doubting I didn't make a move of course, she was also working and it would be awkward. 

To sum it up the interactions were fun, she was laughing even when telling me about boring procedures or medications, I was answering with a mix of being serious and witty, etc. We didn't get to the point of asking personal stuff, but I asked her how long she had been working there, if she was happy and so on. Everything was very natural. 

At some point since I had to lie on my back I took my t shirt off and she blushed, I'm in shape and she was also quite tiny. Overall she was smiling and laughing a lot. 

Now I sort of regret a bit not having made a move asking her for a coffee or smth, but on the other hand I really respect other people's space and I don't like taking the risk of making them feel awkward. ",0,1765871102.0,AskMenAdvice,24,0.5,False

Even if I went to get coffee or lunch for us while studying he would give me his card to pay for it. I never thought I was a gold digger because I never asked him for gifts or asked him to take me out to eat even. This all changed a couple months ago, when we were studying and I asked him if he wanted for me to get coffee for us since I was already going. He said sure, so then I asked for his card. He had always offered his card before and never let me pay so this time I just asked. He gave me his card but his face fell. Later on I asked him what was wrong and he said that he didn’t like what I just did and that it made him feel like I was after his money. I explained to him that I only asked for it cus he always offered it, and he said that I should only take his card when he offers. Since then I have felt guilty when he pays for my food. I have been more cautious of what he pays for and have tried to pay for more food/drinks than before. I dont want him to pay for my food anymore but he still insist. I don’t like telling him I crave something because he will want to buy it for me, making me feel guilty.

The influx of agricultural machinery such as fertilizers, harvesters, and tractors, along with food processing equipment such as driers, grinders, mixers, refrigeration plants, etc from the Soviet Union has given the Arbenz government a method on which to sustain the support of the peasantry. !<

March 1956 would see Guatemala City begin the redistribution of fertilizers, harvesters, tractors, and food processing equipment from the Port of Champerico across much of the countryside. The arrival of new agricultural equipment is hailed in the newspapers as a moment of victory for Jacobo Arbenz. After all the man and his ministers have somehow managed to acquire agricultural tools even in the midst of a strained budget and declining consumer imports. 

Yet while government sources have lauded these efforts and the arrival of machinery from abroad - their delivery to the countryside has little actual effect on the overall economic situation. On one hand the presence of the agricultural machinery and food processing tools will help increase agricultural productivity and output. Yet with the absence of foreign markets large and close enough to export Guatemalan agricultural goods to the republic will struggle to gather funds to sustain any sort of expansion outside subsistence farming. 

What does have an economic effect is the slowly emerging reality that the Republic of Guatemala has made new trade deals with the Soviet Union. The shipment of bananas, coffee, and other agricultural goods across the Atlantic and Pacific to non American markets would not remain a secret forever. In March 1956 independent investigators in the media discover that the Guatemalan Republic has begun exporting notable amounts of agricultural produce to the Soviets. Yet by this point all the fervent opposition from the landowners and clergy falls on deaf ears - and complaints are henceforth few and far between with these groups never acknowledged by the ruling powers.

The Soviet Union will never be able to replace the American consumer market - yet the presence of a new market helps to provide some much needed funds to the Guatemalan Republic and its peasantry.

This shift of export to the Eastern Bloc has been the mark of a new era of populist economic policy. In light of abandonment by the World Bank, American creditors, and with other credit sources drying up due to the economic blockade Arbenz can no longer justify moderation when dealing with foreign companies such as the United Fruit Company. He has taken a hard line against foreign entities within the nation's borders. 

#United Fruit Company and Arbenz's Guatemala 

Since the implementation of Decree 900 in 1952 the United Fruit Company had been left untouched by the Arbenz government. Jacobo Arbenz and his followers had been more content to engage in agricultural projects and focus their land reforms mainly on the Guatemalan land elites. Yet after two years of economic blockade by the United States any sympathy that the Guatemalan Government had for the United Fruit Company has dried up. 

As of March 1956, President Arbenz enacts a decree which ultimately expropriates some 94,700 ha (234,000 acres) of uncultivated land from United Fruit Company holdings. Little compensation has been offered. 

United Fruit Company's subsidiary, International Railways of Central America (IRCA), has faired even worse. In the background of the Suez Crisis IRCA has faced its own forceful nationalization at the hands of the Guatemalan government. All major railway lines, trains, stations, and other assets found within Guatemalan borders are seized by the Guatemalan government. A new state run company, Railways of Guatemala, is created to manage these newly acquired assets. 

In 1950, IRCA ordered several diesel locomotives from General Electric. These locomotives have been put up for sale on the international market to gather further funds or are torn for industrial parts. Older steam locomotives will be used on the railways as diesel spares will be too expensive to procure. United Fruit Company is lightly compensated for the seizure of IRCA. These seizures are finished off by the Guatemalan government's seizure of the IRCA owned pier at Puerto Barrios. This in turn means that the Guatemalan government has become the main determining authority regarding the price of transporting goods through Puerto Barrios to abroad. 

These land, railway, and pier seizures become heavily publicized in the Guatemalan newspapers and are widely known in towns across the republic. United Fruit Company in Guatemala as a whole has not been nationalized. However some of its most important assets - mainly in the form of the railways and pier - are taken from its hands. Land is taken from it. The company undoubtedly suffers several consistent hits over the weeks that pass. 

#Government Assistance 

In order to help struggling Guatemalan families rebuild savings the Arbenz Administration has been forced to make some harsh decisions in other sectors of government. For one all cultural programs and projects find themselves closed down - with the money being redirected to the Ministry of Finance. This money will then be further redirected to the Guatemalan people through emergency cash payments in order to attempt to assist them in stabilizing their depleted savings. 

All agricultural research is brought to a halt. Many of these projects are also closed down to funnel monetary assistance to the peasantry. 

In total the Arbenz government places a great emphasis on maintaining funding for the armed forces, healthcare, monetary assistance, and basic government functions. It has proven itself more willing to close down cultural, social, and scientific research projects to redirect funding to areas it deems vital for national survival.

It is a harsh flight and bitter decisions are made in the halls of power. In the end, however, it is deemed that the loss of these social, scientific, and cultural programs shall be necessary in order to sustain the Arbenz government into the immediate future. 

#Summary 

The seizure of United Fruit Company land and International Railways of Central America assets are both examples of populist policies put in place with the aim of maintaining support domestically. They are both a response from Arbenz to the continued economic blockade of his nation. Domestically the surviving elites view these actions as retaliation from the radical Arbenz for the struggling Guatemalan economy. 

Furthermore, the Guatemalan government has begun enacting austerity measures in nist areas. All cultural programs and scientific research projects are shut down for the foreseeable future. Their monetary funds are redirected towards ensuring the basic functions of government and funneled into monetary assistance schemes aimed to rebuilding the monetary pool of average Guatemalans. This assistance mainly takes the form of direct cash payments. 

The Armed Forces are spared this austerity. As in Nicaragua, funding for the Armed Forces continued uninterrupted. 

Money garnered from the export of agricultural produce to the Eastern Bloc is stored away in an effort to rebuild the government's foreign cash reserves. Otherwise said money is funneled into schemes to repay recently obtained loans from Mexico and other regions. 

All in all a populist approach to economics with lingering hints of the old, liberal approach which characterized Guatemala in the early 1950s before the economic blockade began. ",1,1765870604.0,ColdWarPowers,0,1.0,False

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

It’s surpassed teen drama by miles. It kinda reminds me of how MTV’s Teen Wolf developed. 

The shootings and stabbings and physical assaults/attacks are getting hard to stomach. I can handle the implied violence but watching young women get choked and bound and slammed and drugged is insane. I find it interesting the difference in the type of violence women and men experience in the show. 

I think after Mona was revealed to be A in season 2, the writers or fans or both wanted a more intense storylines. I’ve just accepted the weird plot holes and questionable character development but what could these 4 teenage girls have done for this severe torture.

**Carrier books a Tennessee to Texas load on a Friday. $3,100 for 700 miles. Obviously too good. He knows something's off but takes it anyway.**

**Red flags immediately:**

**• ""Broker"" wants to grab coffee and get personal**

**• After loading 45k lbs of liquor, says skip San Antonio and deliver to ""my address"" in Houston**

**• He Googles the Houston address. It's an abandoned mall.**

**Instead of bailing, he checks the BOL. Sees Landstar on it. Calls them directly. They confirm it's their freight and honor the rate.**

**Delivered to San Antonio. Over $4/mile. Scammer got nothing.**

**But here's the thing—this is getting harder to do. Highway just reported they blocked 605k+ fraudulent emails and 62k+ spoofed phone numbers in Q3 ALONE. CargoNet says average theft value doubled to $336k. AI bots are now making carrier calls trying to sound American.**

**The OTR guys made a good point: most people would've walked away or delivered to the fake address. This dude trusted his gut, did 5 min of homework, and came out on top.**

**Moral: when it smells like a scam, the real broker's name is usually on the paperwork somewhere. One phone call can flip the whole situation.**

Is this already perimenopause or am I going crazy?,"Hi girls. I’m 38, two kids, full-time job, and for the past six months I’ve just been surviving. I wake up in the morning already exhausted, coffee doesn’t help during the day, and by evening I barely make it to the couch. I used to be full of energy — workouts, hobbies, sex 3–4 times a week. Now all I want is to sleep and eat carbs.

I went to the doctor: did general blood tests — everything’s normal. Iron ok, thyroid ok, blood sugar ok. The doctor shrugged: “You’re a mom, you work, it’s normal to be tired.” But I know this is NOT normal.

I started digging on my own. Turns out perimenopause can start as early as 35–40 — when estrogen begins to fluctuate, even if your periods are still regular. And one of the first symptoms is exactly this unexplained fatigue, even when all tests are “within normal range.”

The scariest discovery: standard reference ranges for hormones are often based on women in their 20s–30s. For us in midlife, the “normal” should actually be different — higher estradiol and progesterone to feel good. If levels drop but haven’t yet gone below the lower limit, the doctor says “everything’s fine,” while you feel like a wreck.

I found my old tests from 3 years ago and compared: estradiol dropped almost 40%, progesterone sank too — and it’s still “normal.” But the trend is obvious. It’s like slowly descending stairs — no one notices until you fall.

Now I’m tracking symptoms, keeping a journal, and thinking about more detailed hormone panels. Has anyone else been through this? How did you realize it was hormones? What helped bring back your energy — supplements, lifestyle changes, HRT? Or are there any services that help compare tests over several years and spot trends?

I’d really love to hear your stories. I feel like I’m not alone, but everyone around me acts like this is how it’s supposed to be at 38. It’s not.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

will be blocked immediately!\*\*\*

My name is Doll. I’m a 19 year-old princess from Australia. 👑

Don’t worry, even if you’re in a different time zone, I’m flexible! I’m very sweet, so I’m not the kind of Domme that is going to put you down, That doesn’t mean I won’t have you kneel at my feet and open your wallet, silly. I’ll still drain you with a smile on both our faces! >:\]

I love bragging about my subs and their sends. 

I want to show what a good little sender you are, so we can discuss posting your tribute history. I’ll keep you anonymous if I do (I can’t have anyone trying to take you from me). 

To my shy little puppies who like to silent-send, nothing will make me happier than to wake up to notifications of your tributes. 

You’d make my day, and I’ll send my appreciation.💕

\*\*\*Note: This part needs some more clarification

I’m not the kind of woman to send or post nudes, so get your head out of the gutter, subbies! Anyone asking for NSFW content will be blocked immediately.

\*\*DON’T do any NSFW content! 

I’m more like an online girlfriend but minus the sexual part so if you were hoping for something more on the NSFW side then I’m definitely not the FinDom you’re looking for! (which is okay💗)

My content is SFW, and I can’t wait to show off what I get with your money. 

I want to cosplay, and I’m looking forward to showing off the outfits you’ll get me. 

If you have a suggestion, be ready to send!

If you are embarrassed about your little wallet, don’t be shy about sending small tributes. 

A girl’s gotta have lunch and coffee, after all. You can still please me by getting something off my wishlist as well.

You’ll put a smile on my face.💕

While I do appreciate random sends, what I really want is to build a relationship with a sub.

I want to own you and talk to you regularly. I know some of you boys just want to send, send, and send, but I don’t want you to be in an unstable situation. 

I’m an ethical Domme, so I insist we agree upon a budget that I will not let you go over. 

I’m looking forward to draining every penny out of that budget. It’s not the dollar amount that is important to me, it’s the control you’re going to give me, that gives me the most pleasure\~ 😇

\*\*\*i HATE PayPal which is why I’ll be only using Throne, youPay and AUS Amazon gift cards! 

This princess gets mad with time wasters! >:\[ 

 Initial tribute is not negotiable so don’t try to!

I’m cute as a button but don’t be fooled, I love when a man worships the ground I work on , 

kisses my feet and let’s everyone know that he 

Is my property! 

with that being said, the things I 

don’t hate doing with my little pets are: 

\*\*\*only in text form\*\*\*\*

•dirty talk 

•FinDom/ FinSub \[ obviously 🙄 \]

•Age play \[ heavily restricted in some areas in this kink \] 

•Erotic humiliation 

•praise kink 

•degrade kink 

•impact play 

•objectification 

•ownership kink  

•foot/feet \[ comes with a price tag obviously, do you really think I’d show my pretty little feet for free ?? \]

1pnvmsp,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1pnvmsp/a_10minute_sunday_habit_taught_me_about_discipline/,A 10-minute Sunday habit taught me about discipline.,"I used to think discipline was about big changes: waking up at 5am, working out daily, perfect diet. Every time I made a resolution it was these huge goals, and every time I failed.

Then I saw a quote: ""Don't start at 100, start at 1""

I decided to try the smallest habit: spend 10 minutes every Sunday morning vacuuming my mattress, couch, and carpet, just this one thing.

First two weeks were okay, I had an alarm reminder. Week three was the turning point, that day I really didn't want to do it. Tired, lazy, every excuse popped up. But I still did it, because it's just 10 minutes.

After finishing that one time, I suddenly understood: discipline isn't doing things when you're motivated, it's doing them when you completely don't want to.
Now it's been eight weeks, this habit doesn't require thinking anymore. Sunday morning, drink coffee, then vacuum. Automatic like brushing teeth.
I'm ready to add a second small habit, but I'll wait until this one is completely solid, one at a time.

Looking back, I used to fail because I was greedy, trying to change five habits at once. Now I've learned: start with a habit so small it's impossible to fail, prove to myself I can stick to it, then slowly expand.

Vacuuming the mattress itself isn't important. What's important is it taught me: keeping promises to myself starts with the smallest things.",5,1765868832.0,getdisciplined,1,1.0,False

yesterday I had a lot of free time, so I decided to grind a bit of some beans I didn’t really like and lightly season the burrs. I didn’t go overboard, since it’s a conical burr and doesn’t need that much + I don’t even have enough coffee to waste 😅

I completely disassembled the grinder, cleaned it thoroughly, put everything back together, and today I brewed a truly unreal cup.

The result is very comparable to what I get from the 078.

To be honest , the Sculptor still wins slightly in terms of a cleaner aftertaste, . and a bit more sweetness clarity. In the other hand I found the k7 has a bit of dryness aftertaste

What surprised me here was the very high juiciness, with a light body.

Honestly, this is the best result I’ve ever gotten from the K7.

It really disappointed me in previous brews, but today it finally gave me an incredible cup and absolutely made my day 👌🏻✨

..

Alex stands in front of the gravestone.

He reads the inscription again.

Solskinn og brød og ånd eies av alle
Freia Karlsen
2009–2020

“There’s a conference today,” he says quietly. “I have to go. Suit and all.”

A pause.

“You’d have been twenty-one.”
He corrects himself without comment.
“You should have been.”

He looks at the stone, then away.

“You would’ve crushed trees by now,” he says. “And people. Those green eyes.”

Almost a smile.

“It never made sense that you died.”
He lets that stand.
“But something came of it.”

He straightens, steps back.

“Kids get more time now.”

Freia’s death had been violent—sudden, brutal, tragic—and in how early it came, unnecessary in every way that mattered.

He reads the words on the stone yet again

Solskinn og brød og ånd eies av alle.

The song comes back to him. Kringsatt av fiender.

First, they sang together. Clear voices, steady.
Later, they sang for her.
And in the end, not at all.

Alex hadn’t known silence could sound that empty without Norwegian voices in the hallway. But that was what the loss of hope sounded like. 

At the funeral, it had been different.

The song had filled the room. Loud. Certain. Unrestrained. At a volume that felt right for Freia—for the way she had taken up space, even at eleven.

As the priest spoke, a line had settled in Alex’s mind, uninvited and persistent.

Sunlight and bread and spirit belong to everyone.

He had understood then that it wasn’t metaphor.

She had been Freia to the end.

He knew now—ten years later—standing on the edge of a conference he had been invited to as an honorary guest, because the temporary rule he had fought for had been made permanent, and children like Freia were given something closer to a real chance—that her death had not been without meaning.

Ten years earlier.

Freia had been proof that things became interesting when someone cared enough.

Alex had never expected to enjoy learning about tree species. He had also never met an eleven-year-old who wanted to be a logger. Not in a vague, childish way—but with intent. With plans.

She discovered quickly that he could name maybe four trees.

She didn’t tease him for it. She looked at him like this was good news.

“That’s okay,” she said. “We can start there.”

She made him a syllabus.

It was handwritten, serious, and adjusted to his schedule. Her parents, slightly amused and slightly embarrassed, let her use her allowance on small wood samples—spruce, pine, birch, larch, and several Alex couldn’t pronounce. Each one was labeled in careful block letters. 

Alex didn’t know it then, but those samples would become the reason for his first truly expensive purchase. Frames. Real ones. They would hang in every place he ever lived—not only as a record of what had been lost, and what might have been, but as a reminder of a remarkable person he had once been lucky enough to know.

They would stay there until the day he died. After that, Zola would insist on taking them. She had been there through the trial—on his side, obviously. She knew exactly how precious they were.

What stayed with him was how happy it made her when he cared about all the tree stuff.

Not impressed. Not proud. Grateful.

She never treated his questions as stupid. She never laughed. If he didn’t understand, she simply explained again. Slower. Deeper. From another angle. As if understanding was something you built together.

All of this existed alongside the illness.

The symptoms had come quickly. Pain that didn’t belong to growing bodies. Weakness where there should have been restlessness. Tests that kept failing to resolve into answers. No diagnosis. No clean edges. Just a steady narrowing of what her body could do.

And still—she was unmistakably alive.

She talked about forests she wanted to work in. About tools. About how some trees only looked strong on the outside. She corrected Alex’s Norwegian gently, never sharply. She insisted on normal things with a quiet stubbornness that didn’t ask permission.

The contrast was almost unbearable: how sick she was, and how much space she took up anyway.

Alex would understand later that this was what made losing her intolerable.

Not just that she died—but that she had been so fully herself while living, right up until the system decided how much of that living could be afforded.

The call comes in late in the afternoon.

Alex is standing in the hallway, chart balanced against the wall, finishing a sentence he has written many times before. The voice on the other end is polite, professional, unremarkable.

They confirm the case. They thank him for his time. They say they just need to update the file.

He answers the questions as they come. Symptoms. Progression. What has been ruled out. What hasn’t.

Then the question changes.

“Based on your medical judgment,” the man says, “do you expect the patient to be alive in six months?”

Alex doesn’t hesitate.

“One can only hope.”

There is a brief pause. Keys clicking.

“Thank you,” the man says. “That’s noted.”

The call ends.

Nothing happens immediately.

That evening, everything appears unchanged. Orders stand. Medications are given. Plans remain plans.

By the next morning, it isn’t.

Approvals that had been automatic are now pending. A treatment scheduled for later in the week is no longer authorized. Pain management requires additional review. Then more documentation. Then nothing at all.

It feels abrupt. Like something has been quietly switched off.

Alex assumes it’s an error.

He checks the chart. He rereads what he wrote. Nothing stands out.

He calls.

The first person forwards him. The second puts him on hold. Eventually someone answers who has access to the file.

“I’m calling about a change in coverage,” Alex says. “It happened overnight.”

There’s a pause while the record is pulled up.

Then an explanation. The six-month assessment has been updated. The case has moved categories. Coverage adjusts accordingly.

Alex points out that nothing about Freia’s condition has changed.

“That’s correct,” the voice says. “The clinical information is the same.”

“So what changed?”

Another pause.

The answer comes carefully.

The classification. The phrasing. How likelihood is registered. Certain words place a case in one category rather than another.

Alex looks down at the chart in his hand.

“But of course I hope,” he says. Not defensive. Almost puzzled. “I wrote a minimum of eight months in her notes.”

There’s a brief pause.

“Yes,” the voice says. “We see that.”

“So hope isn’t replacing the assessment,” Alex says. “It’s part of it.”

Another pause. Longer.

“The issue,” the voice says carefully, “isn’t what else you wrote. It’s how the six-month question was answered.”

Alex lets that settle.

“So the problem isn’t that I was unclear,” he says. “It’s that I used a word everyone uses.”

“We wouldn’t phrase it that way,” the voice replies. “But functionally—yes.”

...

Freia lasts four weeks.

The pain never lets up. It is so overwhelming that the people around her struggle not to cry—not because she does, but because it is difficult to comprehend how much pain a body can contain.

And still, she is there.

She knows who enters the room. She follows what is said. She corrects Alex’s Norwegian, stopping him mid-word, adjusting a vowel until he gets it right. She treats it seriously. Like everything else.

Four weeks is what she gets.

She is the last patient Alex ever treats, at least formally.

Later, when Alex allows himself to think in numbers, he realizes that with the right treatments she might have had a year. Not enough. But incomparably more than this.

He starts looking back.

At first only at her case. At the notes. At the language.

Nothing stands out. No dramatic phrasing. No red flags.

Just ordinary language. The kind everyone uses without thinking. Words that sound harmless until they are read by something that isn’t human.

Hope. Possible. Once in a million.

It becomes clear to Alex that the system isn’t failing when people speak this way.

It’s succeeding.

It saves money precisely because no one knows which words do what. Because no one is told that a sentence, used in good faith, can quietly trigger a cascade that ends care.

The cruelty isn’t hidden.

It’s procedural.

By the time he widens his search, it is no longer about Freia alone.

It is about a structure that works perfectly—by converting ordinary speech into loss—and doing so entirely within the bounds of the law.

And that, he realizes, is the most damning part.

...

Jo clocks it because Alex won’t meet her eyes.

That alone is suspicious.

“Okay,” she says, stopping him. “Why are you being weird.”

“I’m not—”

“You are,” she says. “And you’re bad at it.”

He exhales.

She lowers her voice. “Are you reading charts that aren’t yours.”

He doesn’t answer fast enough.

“Oh my God,” she says. “You are.”

“Jo—”

“Don’t,” she cuts in. “Don’t ‘Jo’ me. Are you out of your mind?”

“Yes,” he says. “Probably.”

She stares at him. Then:

“Do you know how fired you’d be if anyone found out.”

“Yes.”

“And you still did it.”

“Yes.”

She rubs her face with both hands.

“I swear to God,” she mutters. “I leave you alone for five minutes—”

She drops her hands.

“Why,” she says. Flat. Serious now.

Alex doesn’t dress it up.

“Because it’s legal,” he says. “And it shouldn’t be. And it’s killing kids.”

That gets her.

She goes very still.

“…What.”

He explains. Quickly. No speeches. Just enough.

She listens. Doesn’t interrupt. Her jaw tightens.

When he’s done, she nods once.

“Okay,” she says. “So first of all? You’re an idiot.”

“Fair.”

“Second,” she continues, “you don’t get to poke a system like that unless you’re ready for it to punch back.”

“I am.”

She studies him.

“This could blow back on me,” she says. “You get that, right.”

“Yes.”

She shrugs.

“Fine.”

He blinks. “Fine?”

“Yeah,” she says. “Fine. Because if this is real—and it sounds real—then screw them.”

She points at his chest.

“But listen to me. You don’t do this messy. You don’t do this emotional. You do this clean or not at all.”

“I am.”

“You will,” she corrects. “Because if you half-ass this and lose your license for nothing, I will never forgive you.”

A beat.

“And Alex?”

“Yeah.”

She smirks. Just a little.

“I am with you. Burn it down.”

She turns to walk away.

“Come on,” she says. “You’re explaining the numbers to me. Slowly. And then we figure out who you send them to.”

He follows.

..

There is no quiet version of what happens next.

The story breaks first. Numbers. Then faces. Then outrage. Headlines compress years into something clickable. Alex doesn’t watch.

Grey Sloan has no choice but to respond.

Not because the facts are disputed, but because Alex accessed records he was not authorized to see. That part is indisputable. A formal process follows because it has to.

Meredith sees him before the hearing.

She takes him in with the kind of look that inventories damage without sympathy. She reminds him—dryly, almost clinically—that this hospital has a long and flexible relationship with catastrophe, including a precedent where interfering with an LVAD wire did not, in fact, end a career.

Bailey is incandescent in private and immaculate in public. She argues context, intent, proportionality. She makes sure it is entered into the record that Alex didn’t profit, didn’t endanger patients directly, didn’t act out of negligence.

She signs the papers anyway.

Webber speaks last.

He refuses to frame it as betrayal. Alex did the wrong thing for the right reason, and the hospital cannot pretend otherwise without admitting how long it has benefited from silence.

He does not ask Alex to apologize.

He thanks him.

The outcome is procedural.

Suspension pending review. Termination from Grey Sloan. Carefully worded statements.

Outside, the noise keeps building.

Inside, the decision is already made.

Alex leaves knowing exactly what this cost him.

And why he would do it again.

..

About a year later, Jo is the one who names it.

Not during a fight. Not as fallout. Just an evening that has quietly tipped into honesty. Takeout gone cold. Alex distracted in that familiar way—half present, half already elsewhere.

She asks him to sit.

She goes through what he’s already done, calmly. The investigations forced open. The insurers softening their internal language. Fewer hard thresholds. More room for interpretation. Not reform—risk management. The meetings he’s been invited to without knowing who recommended him. The way people have started returning his calls faster than they used to.

No rule has changed yet.

But the ground is shifting.

She tells him she has never been prouder of anyone in her life.

She tells him she loves him. Fully. Without hesitation.

Then she says the part that matters.

That this work can’t stay on the margins. That the practice itself has to change. Nationally. Structurally. Where policy is shaped, not just interpreted. That proximity to power isn’t a luxury—it’s leverage. And that he knows this.

She doesn’t tell him to go.

She tells him what he could do if he did.

Alex reaches for the obvious fix. Long distance. Flights. Calendars. Sporther, more seldomly, but maybe more special.

Jo stops him.

She says she doesn’t want a life made of catching up. She wants the ordinary friction. Burnt mac and cheese. Arguing about whether their kids get more candy. The daily mess that makes love feel shared instead of scheduled.

She reminds him—gently, but firmly—that he taught her not to apologize for what she needs in order to be happy.

She isn’t about to unlearn that.

She says this isn’t her leaving because he chose something else.

She’s choosing to let him choose it all the way.

She says they should end as a very happy married couple before resentment has time to form. While what they have is still intact. While it’s still kind.

She says she wants to stay his family.

She says she isn’t angry.

They come together in that particular kind of embrace where time doesn’t so much stop as lose relevance. Where seconds blur. Where the only thing that matters is that this moment is allowed to continue—just a little longer.

Then it ends.

Alex nods once. He doesn’t argue. He knows when something is already true.

..

About a month later, they’re sitting on the floor of Alex’s new apartment in Washington, D.C.

It’s narrow. Questionable wiring. One window that doesn’t open all the way. Boxes stacked where furniture would normally go.

They drink beer straight from the bottles.

Jo opens one of the IKEA boxes. Dumps the contents on the floor. Starts assembling without ceremony. Alex holds pieces when she tells him to.

They don’t talk much while they work although they still manage to bicker like usual.

At some point they agree, briefly, that they might as well keep sharing the Netflix account.

By midnight, there’s a couch. Jo tests it, lies down, closes her eyes. Alex throws a blanket over her.

She sleeps there.

In the morning, they drink bad coffee standing up. Jo packs, takes a charger from the counter. Alex reminds her to text when she gets home.

She does.

After she leaves, the apartment is very quiet.

Alex stands there for a moment.

Then he opens his laptop.

The list is already there. The one he and Jo made a night when he decided to give up and be a doctor in a no name hospital. More than a hundred items. Meetings. Language. Data. People.

He scrolls once.

That’s enough.

He doesn’t look back.

..

Ten years later, the work has a name.

The Pediatric Coverage Continuity Act passed quietly, folded into federal insurance regulation without ceremony. It did not read like reform. It read like clarification. Prognostic uncertainty could no longer be used to deny or withdraw coverage for children. Clinical ranges mattered more than categorical predictions. Language was required to be interpreted in favor of care.

Hope was no longer a liability.

It took years. Lawsuits. Committees that stalled and reconvened. Drafts rewritten until nothing about them sounded moral, only functional. Alex learned quickly that systems resist emotion but respond to precision.

His name appears in the record. In testimony. In footnotes. In the margins of language that had once done harm and now, at least, did less of it.

He never returned to medicine in the way people expected.

He consults instead. On appeals. On reviews. On cases where treatment was delayed or denied despite the law. He reads files the way he once read charts, tracing where meaning slipped, where an ordinary sentence was allowed to cost someone time a

That is his work now.

It is enough.

His personal life turns out to be less complicated than anyone predicted.

Izzie was his first love. Jo was his greatest. Libby is the one he builds a life with.

She is not a doctor. Not part of an NGO. She is his local barista. Bright, unguarded, insistently alive. She laughs easily. She notices things. She reminds him, daily, that there is still absurd amounts of goodness in the world, even when you spend your life confronting injustice.

They had not planned to get married.

They talked instead about growing old together. About not wasting time. It was Maggie—practical, increasingly exasperated Maggie—who finally told them that if this was what they were doing anyway, refusing to get married wasn’t principled. It was inefficient.

Alex laughed.

Then he realized she was right.

It is not entirely conventional to have one’s ex-wife as best man. Alex knows he married the right woman when Libby suggested it herself, with the simple observation that she couldn’t imagine who else it would be—aside from Meredith, who was usually drunk and dark at weddings.

The Norwegian hymn is sung badly.

The Americans try. Earnestly. Vowels collapse. Timing drifts. The song wobbles and survives. Freia’s parents laugh first, openly and warmly, and sing along anyway.

..

Much later—late enough that he no longer keeps track of the years—Alex sits in the rocking chair he never really meant to own.

The frames still hang on the wall above him. They have for decades.

He still takes calls.

Not many. But enough. Old colleagues. Lawyers. Occasionally a parent who’s been sent his name by someone who knows someone. He listens more than he talks. Asks where the language broke down. Points to the clause that should have protected them.

In the kitchen, Libby is making mac and cheese. It smells faintly burnt. Meredith is at the table, glasses pushed up into her hair, talking through a mouthful like she always has.

There was a time when he was afraid his life would end in regret. In the quiet moments, he’d wondered if all the wrong turns would eventually outweigh the right ones.

He feels immensely lucky to say that this did not end up being true. He simply is—surrounded, supported, and not alone.

He feels immensely lucky to say that this did not end up being true. He simply is—surrounded, supported, and not alone.

There are people and purpose everywhere in his life—friends, chosen family, foster kids who stayed, foster kids who left and came back again, some of them now with children of their own. There are parents of children he once helped, who still send photos and updates years later, long after the crisis passed. Luna still calls him sometimes for medical advice he can no longer quite give—she’s in a different specialty now, and better suited to it than he ever was. There are birthdays he forgets and ones he never misses, and—to his own quiet surprise—his own is never forgotten. Libby remembers everything, down to which pizza from which place he loved when he was young. There is noise when he wants it. Quiet when he doesn’t.

And even though he set the stethoscope down long ago, he knows—without doubt—that he ended up where he was meant to be. The work changed shape. That was all.

Solskinn og brød og ånd.

He leaves this life knowing he helped others claim more life of their own—and that he fully owned his.

**Begin**

\**Muffled* f*ootsteps on wooden floor proceeding to get closer and closer. Slow blanket shifting.* \[Listener restrained to the bed shifts his head\]

…

(Soft gentle voice)\**Light door pushed open creaking loudly.*

Darling, are you awake?

\**Footsteps as Speaker approaches.*

Oh, you are. Fantastic! Even though I absolutely adore your little cute sleepy face, just that one adorable expression unfortunately won’t be enough to satisfy my undying hunger for you!

\**Sits down on bed and caresses the Listener’s hair.*

…

This is why today is a special day. No, it isn’t because it’s our anniversary or anything... although it has been about a month since I brought you up here to the mountains.

…

(Complaining tone)

Oh come on darling, we needed to be far away from any civilization that would only want to corrupt and take away what is rightfully mine.

…

No. It’s just that I decided that it is about time we did some much needed bonding time together: and not like how we do it right now where you sleep peacefully, and I watch over you as your lovely savior. No, we are going to do something... more active that we can both enjoy doing while fully aware of each other’s utter devotion!

…

(Plainly)

The reason why I didn’t do sooner, was because I was a bit more preoccupied with keeping you safe and preventing any haphazard attempts of escape.

…

(Demeaning)

But because you haven’t tried anything stupid these past two weeks, I think now we can finally begin our honeymoon phase proper!

…

(Happy) \**Footsteps and then wheeling something closer to the bed.*

Look what I got for you! Your very own custom built wheel chair! Specially designed to be extra comfortable in practically every aspect. Especially including the restraints!

…

(Pouting)

Can’t you at least act like you’re excited? This is the exact reason why we are doing what we are doing today!

…

(Thinking out-loud) \**Setting up the wheelchair.*

Actually, I don’t think I’ve told you yet what we are going to be doing today.

…

(Little excited)

Well, we are going to have a real dinner together! And not like how we currently do supper where I spoon feed you in bed. No.

…

\**Finishes checking the wheelchair.*

Instead, a real dinner where just the two of us sit at the dining table and learn more about each other! Although in our case, it’ll be more about letting you learn more about me.

…

(Self-reflection)

Actually now that I think about it, it’s more of a date than it is an actual dinner... but who cares!

…

(Up close whisper) \**She puts her face up close to the listeners; they’re almost touching.*

After all, I make the rules.

…

(Back to normal) \*Speaker *pushes herself off the bed and jangles keys.*

Now without further ado, let’s get you out of your bed and into the chair. Even though I love you so much and you have been obedient recently, I can’t exactly trust you to let you wander around the cabin freely, could I?

…

Let’s remove your leg’s leather restraints first dear.

\**Key jangling.*

Alright and now your arms… hold still love.

(Concerned) \**Key jangling and blanket shifting.* \[Listener tries to immediately sit up right, now that his hands are free.\]

Whoa! Not so fast dear.

\**Speaker places hand on chest and gently pushes the listener back down.*

If you move your body too quickly, you’ll only end up hurting yourself. Relax.

\**Rubbing the Listener’s back.*

The last time you were able to move and stretch yourself freely was two weeks ago, in your last attempt to leave. I know it isn’t healthy for your body to just be laying down all day doing nothing, and I know that as your caretaker it seems kind of a bit contradictory, but think of it like this.

...

(Speaking as if to a child)

You wouldn’t want someone you care very much about, like a child, to accidentally hurt themselves as a result of letting them do whatever they want, which in this case is letting them play outside. So when you find out that they ended up doing something foolish that results in a scrape or cut: not only do you have to bandage their wounds, but you have to also… punish them to make sure they know what they did was wrong.

…

In the child’s case, it is simply to keep them inside the house as timeout, for the rest of the day to make sure they are safe and understand the consequences. But if their irresponsible behavior continues…

(Threatening)

Then your punishments also need to escalate.

(Motherly)

I think you understand the moral of the story, do you darling? After all, ever since your last lesson, you’ve been doing so well to the point where I can reward you with this special occasion! I already have the table set up and the steak prepared, so the last thing I have to do before we begin is to bring my special little guest to the table!

…

(Softer tone) \**Bed shifting as the Speaker maneuvers the Listener off the bed and into the wheelchair.*

Grab my hand and let me guide you. That’s it, it’s alright. Go as slowly as you need. I can wait for you. I love you dear.

…

\**Listener is dropped into the chair. The Speaker begins tying the restraints and securing them with metal locks. Key jangles.*

Perfect darling. Sit still for me. Don’t worry, I made sure the cuffs and leather straps won’t cause you any discomfort or leave a rash. Push your legs against the chair dear. Great! Remember, this is all for your safety love.

…

You know, I watched a lot of training videos for hospital orderlies to make sure that when I brought you here, you would always be tightly secured and under constant supervision. Hours upon hours of time did I spend studying how nurses care for those who can’t themselves, all for the sake of you!

…

(Dark humor)

I just can not think of anyone else who would go this far for the person they love!

…

(Small talk) \**Speaker begins pushing the wheel chair out into a hallway.*

It’s been a while since you last been outside your room, hasn’t it? The last time was because you were trying to find a way out, so I don’t think you had a chance to appreciate the smaller details of our petite love-nest.

…<Shorter pause.>

Do you see that half-filled bookshelf? All those heavy-duty books are collages absolutely brimming with my collection of photography with you as the centerpiece! Pictures when society still had its dirty claws on you.

(Passionate)

Ever since our destined meeting, I would follow you everywhere snapping and saving every little action you did! Big or small, it made no difference.

…<Change in subject.>

(Disappointing)

It’s really a shame that I couldn’t dress you up for this event darling. I originally wanted you to wear a custom tailored suit and all, but I figured that getting you out of your bed wear and into the outfit would just be nothing more than a hassle. Besides, I think having you eat formal dishes in your pajamas would be the most hilarious and cutest thing ever!

(Mocking)

Not like you get to decide dear.

…

Hold on while I open the door for us.

(Cheerful tone) \**Wheelchair stops as Speaker opens the kitchen door. Speaker pushes Listener in.*

And here we are! Look at our little dining table dear; isn’t it absolutely adorable! I even covered it with a special red stripped cloth, and even got some new fragrant flowers to put on the table. Aren’t I such a dedicated lover.

…

\**Wheelchair pushing and then sudden stop.*

Let’s park you on your side over here. And... perfect!

\**Speaker claps her hand together.*

I’ve already set up all the utensils and dishes on the table just over an hour ago. I initially wanted to do what we have always been doing, ever since I brought you up here when it came to your mealtime: that is, me personally hand-feeding you. But I thought to myself, what the heck!

…

As another reward for your good behavior, I’m going to untie your dominant hand from the wheelchair’s restraint system for the duration of dinner! This way, you get to be able to eat all by yourself. Although of course, I will occasionally feed you myself love.

(Mocking)

Sorry dear, but I just can’t resist the temptation! You are just that precious!

…

(Normal voice)

Also, you will only have access to a spoon for tonight; can’t have you getting any ideas. Don’t worry, I’ll have a knife and fork so that I can cut the meat into cubes for you to enjoy by yourself.

(Playful seductive) \**Speaker picks up a bottle and soda can.*

And for drinks, I will be drinking this… non-alcoholic beverage. <Chuckle> After all, can’t be the one guard who lets inmates escape while intoxicated, can I?

\**Speaker fills up her glass.*

And for you my love, some of your favorite cherry soda for you to enjoy.

\**Speaker fills up Listener’s glass.*

You know, something that I always appreciated about you was just how imaginative you are! Way back when you were young, you would treat chocolate milk as if it were coffee. Similarly, you would also pretend that soda was beer, whiskey, vodka etc. based on the brand of drink. You never grew out of those perceptions, much to the mockery of your family: but words cannot describe how happy I am that you didn’t! These little quirks make you so much cuter than you already are, and just reinforces the fact that only I understand and appreciate you. I am the only one who can protect you.

…

(Dark voice)

No one else will ever be able to see you for your achievements. They’ll always make fun of you no matter how hard you try. I am the only one you need.

…

(Calm) \**Speaker picks up bread basket and places it on the table.*

Here you are, freshly baked loaves butter included! Let me also free your hand right now dear, so don’t move that much. Thank you!

…

Now to bring out the steak and…

…

(Frustrated)

Oh! Dammit. I can’t believe this darling. I forgot to bring some of those scenic candles to the table for us. God, and I was just bragging to you of how much effort I put into you. This is so embarrassing!

…

(Calm)

Hang still dear, I’ll quickly go to the basement and pick them up right away. You can enjoy some of the bread while I quickly bring them. I hope you like them.

\**Footsteps going away.*

…<Only end pause when footsteps fade away completely>

\*C*loth shuffling.* \[Listener waits a few seconds before shoving his free hand into his pajama pants searching for something\]

…

\**Dissolving/fizzing sound.* \[Listener pulls out a pill capsule. He opens it and pours the drug powder into the Speaker’s drink. Sweat begins to drip from his forehead\] <Speaker can add any sound effects that could help raise the tension, such as an increasing heartbeat etc.>

…

(Normal voice) \**Footsteps can be heard again, increasing in volume with each passing second.* \[Just as the Listener finishes adding the drug, he hears the Speaker getting closer and shoves the capsule back into his pants just in time\] <If the Speaker included sound effects, have it immediately stop the second the Speaker speaks again.>

I’m back darling. Now without further delay let’s begin!

\**Speaker places the candles and brings over the steak along with her fork and knife.*

Now to light the candles…

\**She stumbles and “accidentally” knocks over her glass dropping it onto the floor.* <Foreshadowing is a narrative device used...>

…

(Even more frustrated) \**Speaker picks up the glass and pours the remaining liquid into the sink. She quickly gets a towel and wipes down the floor.*

What is with me today. Trust me darling when I tell you that today is the exception. I am not like this normally. I guess that because I’ve been so excited for us to eat together, I’ve been rushing things when I shouldn’t have. We’re lucky the glass didn’t break: otherwise I would have probably had to cancel our night altogether. Such a waste. At least I was able to clean up so quickly, let me get another glass.

(Calm) \**Speaker pours the drink into her new glass. She also lights the candles.*

There. And now we are back to where we started love! Before we begin, we should make a toast!

…

\**Speaker and Listener raise their glasses and clinks.*

To our blooming love!

…

(Pouting)

Can’t you at least say it out loud. Whatever. Let’s dig in dear!

…

(Motherly) \**Sounds of slicing and scraping.* <For every … include these sounds.>

Hold still dear and open your mouth. Say ahhh… There you go, good job!

…

Another one, open. Here comes the airplane vroom vroom! Good boy. You can bet that the next one will be a train darling! <Chuckle>

…

(Playful)

So… have you gone anywhere recently? I know I know, I’m just playing with ya. Come on, please don’t give me that look darling!

(Motherly) \**Speaker sips drink.*

Hm? You want to know where exactly we are? Well, it’s not like you’ll ever be able to truly leave me, so I guess I could tell you.

\**Speaker puts glass down.*

We are way up in the mountains love. I think an elevation of over 2000 feet above sea level, but that was what the last road sign read: all the way back over in the last city which is over 100 miles away. We may be much higher than that, but I don’t truly know or care.

…

Aw darling, no need to look so down. This is exactly why I can’t trust you to be all by yourself. In case you haven’t noticed, but you’ve been here long enough that snow has now begun falling.

…

(Thinking out loud)

Actually now that I think about it, it’s not your fault that you don’t know that it’s snowing; your room doesn’t have any windows, and when I took you in it was initially the end of autumn.

…

(Sadistic tone)

Fun fact, I read somewhere that interrogation rooms or cells were specifically designed so that the prisoner couldn’t tell the time. This way, mental fatigue and manipulation was easier for the captor to extract exactly what they wanted.

…

I know I shouldn’t tell you any of my psychological tactics, as it is essentially the same of revealing my cards, but I don’t really care even if it makes it longer for you to break.

…

(Up close whisper)

After all, we have all the time in the world… and you have no hope of escape or rescue darling.

…<longer pause to empathize the last line.>

(Cheerful)

And one last bite... open up dear, the train’s coming choo choo! Good boy. You did so well tonight!

…

Ope! You have a little something on your cheek, let me get that for you.

\**Wiping noises.*

That was a delicious meal dear. Tonight was even better than I had expected! What do you think?

…

(Playful and loving) \[Listener looks at her with a smile\]

Oh darling, please don’t give me that adorable beaming smile! If I get too much exposure, I might fall over dead!

…

(Normal/nonthreatening voice) \**Footsteps*

I’ll clean up the table later after I’m done with you. Please place your hand onto the padded cuff’s armrest, and we’ll get going. Thank you love.

…

(Motherly) \*T*ying restraints and key jangles.*

You must be so tired after eating all that steak, aren’t you dear? I know you had soda, but I also know that things that should give you energy, or otherwise keep you awake, seem to not really have an effect on you. Anyway, let’s go.

*\*Footsteps as the Speaker pushes the wheelchair back out into the hallway. Door opening and closing sound as they exit the kitchen. Speaker hums to herself.*

…<Continue last instructions for 10 seconds>

\[Listener realizes that the Speaker passed his bedroom, and yet she is still pushing the chair forward\]

Hm? What’s that? I passed your room?

…

(Sadistic) \**Speaker stops pushing the wheelchair.*

Oh darling, you know what you did… and exactly where we are going.

\**Struggling noises, and footsteps as the Speaker maneuvers herself in front of the listener.* \[Listener realizing begins desperately trying to get out\]

You know, while I do love your cute and happy expressions, I also think you are just as adorable when in pain. Actually, you might even be cuter than normal when in that state! And not to mention the buildup where you watch me gather and test my tools: I can literally see the beautiful panic rising in your eyes! Aw, so precious… and all mine!

…

(Motherly sadistic tone) \**Speaker rubs the Listener’s cheek.*

Shh, shh darling. If it makes you feel worse, I’ll have you know that I always planned this event to be a sort of test for you. And you failed.

…

Of course, I understand that if you were given simple ways to escape, you would take them, which is why I made sure to keep the knives and other obvious opportunities stashed away safely. I figured that once you found no clear routes of escape, you would quit and just enjoy the rest of the night with me, which would indicate progress… but I guess I was wrong in my judgment unfortunately.

…

When I first kidnapped you, no matter what I did that first day, you spent the entire time thinking of ways to break out of your bonds and leave; you also tried your best to adorably block me out as if I wasn’t there!

…

I’ll give you this though, after you realized your plan failed-

(Whisper)

As it will always do.

(Motherly)

You decided to play along and enjoy yourself, instead of shutting down. Whether it was because you were trying to not get caught or if you are genuinely getting comfortable with me, it is certainly a lot better than how you acted weeks ago. But don’t think I’ll make your consequences lighter.

…

How did I find out? First off, your nervous stuttering is so adorable! Second, cameras obviously.

\**Speaker pulls out a tablet and shows the listener dropping the powder. reuse the audio of the event from earlier.*

I know you know that I installed cameras in your room, that’s a no-brainer. I also believe that you also understood that there were cameras in the hallway or the foyer in case you got that far. I don’t know what happened, but you seemed to believe that if the room wasn’t a vital area or an exit, there would be no cameras. Maybe you just believed I was that stupid, or most likely you were so desperate that you took your chance…

(Up close whisper)

And blew it.

…

(Mocking)

I literally said that you would always be under constant watch, didn’t I? I knew from the start you hadn’t swallowed your medicine that day and kept it after I walked out of the room: so don’t look like a deer frozen in the headlights, despite how cute it is. Besides, even without cameras, did you think that I wouldn’t find your sweat suspicious? You were literally sitting there for what? 30 seconds?

…

(Normal voice)

What am I going to do to you? I’m honestly still deciding. I might waterboard you. Maybe give you a few new scars. All I’m sure of is that your visit to my treatment chamber, will be much worse than it was two weeks ago.

...

(Dark voice) \**Grabs Listener’s fingers.* \[Listener still struggling\]

Keep your fingers flat dear. You should be grateful that I’m only looking at your <non-dominant> hand. Let’s see. Last time I ripped off eight of your fingernails. To make it more severe, I might just cut off two fingers this time. But which ones? I obviously can’t take your ring finger, where else would I be able to slip on your wedding rings?

…

(Sadistic mocking)

I’ll probably take the middle finger for an obvious reason, but I may also collect your cute little pinky. We’ll see, maybe the punishment will be much worse once I get you down there.

\**Speaker grabs the Listener’s legs*

Or I could cut off your leg: literally cut off any more major escape attempts. But I know how much you love to prance around, and not being able to watch you skip might punch a hole in my heart! I can’t cut off your leg, unless you keep on misbehaving. Maybe I’ll flay your skin to get the point across. Decisions, decisions!

…

(Serious)

Quiet dear! You brought this upon yourself. You know my philosophy, each punishment will be worse than the last! I’ve given you plenty of chances, but you stick your nose in defiance. Well, I don’t really care. Sooner or later, you’ll capitulate.

…

I think you’ve been screaming long enough. Let me just…

\**Struggling as she inserts a gag.*

…

(Sadistic joy)

There you are love: exactly just like the good old days.

\**Footsteps*

I think we’ve stalled long enough, haven’t we dear. If there is one last thing I should say before your punishment begins, it is that I will always love you darling… and that you’ll never leave.

...

(Laughter) \**Speaker begins pushing the wheelchair again as she laughs manically, while the listener continues to struggle in vain. End the video with the Speaker’s laughter fading and finally the creaking sounds of a heavy metal door opening.*

Now, time for your lesson!

1pnverr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pnverr/personal_crisis/,Personal crisis,"Hello.
Bit of a background on me before I dump information and ask for advice on what to do.
Im 32 y/o male working as a shift manager at dominos pizza, my wife is 36 and a produce manager at a grocery store, she has ms and we struggle a fair bit.

On friday, my transmission on my car died, our only transportation to work for the two of us ( one car shared between two people ), so i have to call out of work and take the car to the shop.

Friday passes, and i get into a rental car that we are sharing, getting a new transmission and the rental for the week cost almost 9000$. I get to work that evening and I get written up for calling out on the previous day.

Sunday arrives and nothing happens its just a normal day.

Monday arrives and a pipe bursts in my kitchen, so when I wake up to make coffee there is a quarter of an inch of sitting water throughout the entire kitchen. I get it all cleaned up and learn that the water damage has destroyed the refrigerator and the oven. I call a plumber and spend 400$ fixing the pipe and am able to get a new ( to me ) fridge and oven for $500 installed the same day. At the end of all of this, I am notified that my landlord is selling the property that we are living in and are told to leave within 90 days.

I am freaking out, my bank account is in the negative, sitting on multiple maxed out credit cards and am in desperate need of advice/help/some way out, I am on the verge of a severe panic attack and the stress is eating me alive. 

Please, someone if not anyone, give me some type of advice on how to proceed.

Thank you",3,1765868001.0,Advice,0,0.81,False
1pnve6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/ti84hacks/comments/1pnve6o/do_not_seek_purpose_of_human_life_because_here/,"do not seek purpose of human life, because here that is","Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",0,1765867941.0,ti84hacks,0,0.33,False

I’ve cleared all prior rounds for a Salesforce role (HR screening, Hiring Manager 1-on-1, and a Panel Round). In the panel round, the hiring manager mentioned that if we moved forward, he’d like to see a 30-60-90 day plan and a territory plan.

Now, HR has scheduled the next step as a “casual coffee chat” at their office, and they’ve said there’s no formal presentation expected. That said, given the context, I’m preparing a deck anyway - better to be over-prepared than under-prepared.

I’d really appreciate advice on how to approach this stage, especially from people who’ve interviewed at Salesforce or similar enterprise SaaS companies.

Specific questions I’m hoping the community can help with:

1. What’s the real purpose of a “coffee chat” this late in the interview process? – Is it more about culture fit, executive presence, trust, or testing how you think without slides?
2. How would you structure a strong 30-60-90 day plan, specifically for Salesforce? 
3. When they ask for a territory plan, what are they *actually* evaluating?
4. How deep should territory planning go in an interview setting?
5. Roughly how long should the presentation be, if I do end up walking through it? Number of slides and/or minutes?
6. Should I proactively offer to walk through the deck, or wait to be asked?
7. What are common curveball or probing questions they ask at this stage?
8. Any mistakes you’ve seen candidates make in final-round coffee chats that cost them the offer?

I need to know though, what being in your presence is really like. 

Every morning, we send the same good morning text. Every morning, we send the same question about coffee. 

Every night, the same goodnight.

For almost two years our friendship has felt the closest I have been with someone in a long time.

Before my life speeds up, I need to know what it feels like to simply hang out with you outside of a game, outside of a call.

I know I'm going on this trip for entirely selfish reasons. It's going to be amazing, and I can only hope our friendship can survive. 

I hope this trip ends with a hug and not an awkward wave. I hope the pictures we take end up being fond memories we will still be able to talk about for years to come.

Pic 1 (Lilly's Cafe, Hawai Nagar): Lilly's cafe have some really great Ramen and Korean snacks, full of taste! Coffee is amazing easily one of the best in Ranchi, Ambience is great they play really nice music and have nice sunlight coming through, Highly recommended especially in winters

Pic 2 (Starbucks Ashok Nagar): Ambience is nice coffee is overpriced for the taste but it is a really great place to sit and focus on work quietly, coffee is greak obiously but food and snacks could have been better, I would recomment cheese chilly toast that's the only snack I like there. 

Pic 3 (Dishayen beside Gossner College): The filter coffee is soo amazing probably the best coffee you will get in whole Ranchi, They have nice menu of south and north indian breakfast and they taste soo freaking amazing. I had this half upma and coffee for just 84 rupees, it's budget friendly. I visit this cafe the most due to it's tasty breakfast and best filter coffee

Pic 4 (Mocha Cafe Lalpur): The vibe is really amazing but it is not a place you can visit oftenly it is a kind of place you go once or twice a year to have a great time, I would recommend you all to visit Mocha only on saturdays because they play live music which really relaxes and soothes you.

Pic 5 (The Artist Block Cafe Lalpur): This cafe has nice ambience, it will take you lots of trial and error to get a perfect coffee because they have too many options and customization in coffee, you can visit once for the vibe but I usually do not prefer this.

\*Hazel\* 

I suppressed a groan as my muscles tingled with protest. The sun was just beginning to rise and I had already been up for over two hours. My fingers were raw from scrubbing the floor and cleaning the bathrooms. I didn't have time to dwell on how tired I was though. I needed to make sure I was downstairs and standing at attention in the kitchen in ten minutes. 

I didn't have much time according to my watch and I quickly wiped some sweat off of my brow before rushing down the steps of the expansive pack mansion. 

""Cutting it a little close there, aren't you?"" asked the cook, a kind elderly woman named Clara. 

I grimaced but offered her a smile in greeting. ""I had a lot to finish this morning,"" I said but quickly took my post just to the left of the Luna's chair. 

I barely had enough time to catch my breath when the Alpha's family strode through the double doors leading into the dining room. The cook and the other servants straightened but lowered their eyes to our Alpha and Luna. 

Alpha Henry and Luna Evelyn were the definition of authority. They were well-respected by every pack member but also feared. Alpha Henry's icy blue eyes were cold enough to freeze over an entire room and Luna Evelyn's matching cool exterior made even the toughest shifter squirm with nerves. 

The three young men who strode in after them were clearly a product of the two pack leaders. All of us servants straightened even further as the three sons of the Alpha and Luna marched in. 

My heart stuttered at their large forms. They had to come in single file or they would have completely filled the doorway. 

Lucas Sullivan was the eldest of the triplets. Even though it was only by a few minutes, he exuded the confident air of the oldest brother. 

Lucas met my gaze and I quickly looked down again to avert my eyes. Not quick enough though. I felt the sternest brother stop in front of me. 

""Like what you see, little servant?"" he drawled, his voice low and deep. 

I clenched my jaw, hating the way he once again brought attention to how much lower I was than them in the hierarchy. 

I heard his two younger brothers chuckle at the joke, further adding to my shame. 

Lucas stepped away from me without a care and sat down next to his father, effectively labeling himself as the right hand. 

A little bit of tension left my shoulders as the next brother came up to me. Liam wasn't nearly as cruel to me as his other brothers. 

That didn't mean the more playful of the triplets wasn't intimidating though. Like his brothers, Liam was broad-shouldered and rugged. His deep, dark eyes looked like they could penetrate through any soul, leaving nothing hidden. 

I snuck a glance up at Liam as he walked by me, immediately regretting it when I realized he was watching me just as his brother had been. He looked like he was going to continue to his seat, but when we met gazes, he smirked and walked right up to me. I tried to duck my head but not before the middle brother flicked my nose, bringing tears of pain and shock to my eyes. 

""Keep your eyes down next time,"" he scolded before he too sat down at the dining table. 

I couldn't even relax, even though two of the three brothers were now seated and leaving me alone. An equally large figure appeared in front of my eyes. I kept my head down this time, refusing to meet the gaze of the owner of the toned male chest in front of me. 

""That's right, keep your eyes down,"" Levi, the youngest brother said with satisfaction. 

My cheekbones burned but I didn't need to see Levi's dark eyes to know that they were glinting with pleasure at my discomfort. Although Levi was the youngest of the three, he was still terrifying and fed off of my fear and on my pain, just like his other brothers did. 

Levi scoffed when I didn't respond and went to take his seat next to Liam. 

""Well, what are you waiting for, girl?"" Luna Evelyn demanded. ""Begin serving us our breakfast at once!"" 

""Yes, Luna,"" I squeaked before doing as ordered, putting eggs and bacon on each of their plates. 

""Be quick about it, girl,"" Alpha growled, watching me with narrowed eyes. He scoffed. 

Luna Evelyn sniffed. ""And to think we took you in and gave you a practical way to pay your parents' debt. Such ungratefulness!"" 

""My apologies, Luna,"" I said, keeping my head bowed. 

After my parents died in an accident, I was taken in by the Alpha and his family. I was informed that my parents owed a great amount of money to the Alpha and Luna. They announced that I would be their maid in service in order to pay them back. 

I was only ten years old when I started cleaning and waiting on the whole family. They were all cruel toward me, ordering me to work from sun up til sundown, coming up with tiring chores for me to complete before I finally collapsed in bed each night, completely exhausted. 

""You have managed to remember that tomorrow is our sons' birthdays,"" Alpha Henry said in a hard voice as I scrambled to get their coffees poured quickly but without spilling a drop. 

If I made a minor mistake like that, the punishment would be severe. 

""Yes, Alpha,"" I said respectfully. 

""I expect the decorations to be immaculate,"" Luna Evelyn cut in, glowering at me like if it wasn't, her sons would be cursed or something. ""Everything must go perfectly. You'll know what to expect if it doesn't."" 

I swallowed thickly but bowed to her, ducking my head. ""Yes, Luna Evelyn. I understand perfectly."" 

Although I felt rotten by how they were treating me. I refused to cry. 

I was going to be strong and continue to live the way my parents would have wanted me to. 

\*\*\* 

""Is this the best you could do?"" 

I turned to look at Jessie. She was the daughter of one of the higher ups of the pack and was studying interior design. She was sent to ensure that I didn't mess up the decorations, despite the fact that Luna Evelyn put me in charge of them. 

I tried to keep the annoyance out of my tone as I turned to face her. ""What do you mean?"" 

Jessie gestured around arrogantly. ""These are so typical, not special enough for the triplets' birthday."" 

I looked around the grand ballroom. I had chosen golds and bronzes to symbolize the status of the guys. There were balloons and bouquets of flowers strewn everywhere. The gold and bronze against the stark white table linens looked sophisticated to me, perfect for an eighteenth birthday celebration. 

""These are some of the guys' favorite colors,"" I told Jessie as patiently as I could. ""I've grown up with them so I'm fairly certain they'll be accepting of the decorations."" 

Jessie's jaw dropped before her eyes narrowed. ""How dare you imply that you know them better than anyone?"" 

Before I could protest that that wasn't what I was saying at all, the door opened and the topic of our conversation strode in, their girlfriends hanging onto their thick arms. 

I tried to school my expression. Melanie, Kira, and Annie were stuck-up and arrogant, so I felt they were the perfect match for the triplets. I wondered how long these girls would be around since the triplets go through women like they do clothing. It was rare for them to keep girlfriends for more than three months. 

I heard Liam whistle low as he got a look at the ballroom. ""Nice,"" he said appreciatively. 

""We're here to check on your progress, little maid,"" Lucas said as he approached, Kira holding onto him tightly. 

""You're just in time!"" Jessie shrieked, stepping forward. She pointed an accusing finger at me. ""Hazel here claimed she would be the best mate to the three of you!"" 

I reeled in shock. ""No-"" I started to say. 

""How dare you!"" Melanie cried out, stalking forward. ""You could never land our men!"" 

""Little bitch!"" Kira snarled. 

""You're in for it now!"" Annie added. ""You're nothing but a lowly maid!"" 

""Ladies,"" I heard Liam warn, a clear warning in his voice. 

I didn't even have time to blink before a slapping sound rang out throughout the ballroom, a stinging pain accompanying it. My hand flew to my throbbing cheek and I stared at Annie in shock. ",1,1765866955.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1pnv0y9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AusPublicService/comments/1pnv0y9/social_clubs_within_the_aps/,Social Clubs within the APS,"This is a reasonably simple question for any APS who have social club events on site or are part of their social club. Does your social club have to self fund their own insurance while on site or are they covered by Comcover?

A bit out of the box but kind of still working conditions.

Some context below.
We have a pretty good social club at my office and much more social than other offices within the same organisation which is great. But earlier this year our social club were told they would no longer be covered by Comcover while running a social event on site and would need to get separate insurance coverage. (No incident prompted this change.) Even though everyone employee or not are covered under Comcover while on site of a federal government building.
The social club only runs 6 on site events a year which are our happy hour drinks for a few hours in the afternoon after knock off and having to pay for insurance would mean the social club would not run these events in the future due to the high cost.

Also FYI; we are lucky we don't have to BYO toilet paper and hand towels and obviously do not get tea, coffee, milk or biscuits etc paid for by the organisation.
The social club is a small completely self funded not for profit but is only open to my organisations employees.
The social club only utilises a space in the office for these 6 events.
The social club gives staff a chance to connect and unwind with others within the organisation and meet people they may not have otherwise so I find it hard to believe the organisation would not support such groups by allowing them to be covered by the Aust Gov. Self managed insurance fund Comcover.

So far the social club have been able to run the happy hour events in 2025 with alot of pushback and have brought in the ASU to help but I'd be keen to hear if other APS organisations have the same problem or not.",3,1765866574.0,AusPublicService,18,0.64,False

1pnuzbz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pnuzbz,"“Trattoria Liana” in Ginza, Tokyo Japan","The charming, old-school feel of the restaurant, noticeable even from the street-level sign featuring the Italian flag, was promising a cozy retreat. I had the set lunch which started with a fresh green salad. The vegetables were crisp, vibrant, and lightly dressed. For the main course, I chose the Spaghetti with Garlic and Chili Oil. The presentation was rustic and appetizing, with perfectly cooked spaghetti glistening in a light sauce, topped generously with slices of bacon and thinly sliced garlic and fresh parsley. The flavor was excellent: a simple yet robust dish where the salty richness of the bacon was beautifully balanced by the pungent warmth of the garlic and the kick of chili oil. The pasta itself was cooked al dente and soaked up the flavorful oil wonderfully. The meal concluded with a cup of hot coffee, alongside a small, pleasant bite of dessert😍",1,1765866417.0,u_5second10,0,1.0,False

So about a year ago I went to the gym and a 35-40 year old man approached me while I was on a machine, he was standing directly in front of me and kept talking and talking about his job, his kid, etc. I was being dry and was visibly uncomfortable. I also made a point to mention that I was 17 (at the time) to try to get him to leave me alone but he just kept talking. At the end of the conversation he asked if we could get coffee some time and I said ""oh no I’m too young and I have a boyfriend"" and I think he finally got the hint and left me alone. 

Fast forward a year, I started going to the gym again (different gym btw) and my boyfriend was being extremely insecure the entire time, making comments and such. When I got home he brought up the incident with the old man from a year ago, and claimed that I should’ve walked away from him in the first place and I disrespected our relationship by not doing so. I’m trying to explain to him that it’s not that simple and that men can be scary and it could be dangerous to just get up and ignore him, especially considering he was standing in front of my machine which was a seated machine, so I was kind of cornered. He could’ve followed me, kept talking to me if I walked away, who knows?? I was trying to play it safe and get out if the situation as safely as possible. 

My boyfriend seems to be using this as an excuse to get angry at me for going to the gym a year later….. and demanding for me to answer about what I would do if a situation like that happens again. Additionally, he asked me a series of questions when I got home from the gym such as ""did any guys talk to you?"" ""did you look at any guys?"" ""which guys did you see that we know?"" And making me swear on god after asking each question listed above. The funny thing is that back when that happened he didn’t even get mad, he just seems to be getting more insecure as he’s getting more comfortable in the relationship. 

So am I the ass hole for not walking away from the man over a year ago? 

(And no, I haven’t done anything for him not to trust me) ",2,1765866348.0,AITAH,12,0.75,False

1pnuwta,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianstartups/comments/1pnuwta/building_a_product_to_help_people_travel_and_plan/,Building a product to help people travel and plan better!,"Hi, I'm a student and currently in 3rd year of undergrad. So here is the problem especially with women. Whenever I wanted to travel to a new place I searched the same thing, 'is this place safe to go'. Not the crime rates , just general safety, how safe is for women, how safe is neighborhood or transport . I tried asking many people, all answers were just based on 'vibes', I wanted to see real people experiences . Safety is best if people share there experience and google reviews are too generic , ratings are based on 'how good the coffee' was, not on safety !

Most of the times I found myself in the room , I wanted to travel solo but same safety anxiety and no real data to see. It is so frustrating ! Maybe you guys can also relate, if you are living alone. As a student and traveler it is so frustrating to sit in front of screen for 5 hours just searching same question. Yes I can ask chat gpt, but for safety real people experience matter more I suppose. People post these experience but they are lost in communities.

So, I started building a product called 'Safe or Not', a just type in the location and all stats in one place, even for streets. You can share the experience so other people can travel better.

Wanted to know your feedback and any tips on how to grow!
