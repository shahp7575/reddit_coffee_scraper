It turns making a few coffees in to a 30 minute mundane task.

So I think it's time to buy an automatic coffee grinder. Have been looking at a few options and am currently looking between the DF54 or the Varia VS3. Is there any recommendations as to which would be better to get.

For context I am using an Ascaso Steel Duo. I think the DF54 fits the aesthetics of my machine a bit better so unless the Varia VS3 is a significantly better grinder I'm leaning towards the DF54.

Understanding MCT Oil and the Keto Diet

MCT oil, or medium-chain triglyceride oil, is a powerful supplement that plays a crucial role in the ketogenic lifestyle.

Key Benefits of MCT Oil on Keto:
• Rapid energy production
• Enhanced ketone generation

**SLAP!**

The boy’s head snapped to the side, his cheek burning where his father’s hand had struck. His father’s face was a mask of fury—red, veins bulging, eyes wild with rage.

""DID YOUR MOTHER AND I BEGET THIS MANY CHILDREN JUST FOR YOU ALL TO RUIN YOUR LIVES?!"" he roared, the walls trembling with the force of his voice.

""I'll leave."" Ji-Woon’s lips trembled, his voice barely audible. ""I'm so-""

**SMACK!**

This time, his mother’s hand met his face. Her own tears flowed freely, carving rivers down her grief-worn cheeks. Her eyes, once soft and warm, were now hidden behind swollen, red-rimmed lids. She raised her hand again but stopped, fingers trembling, as if fighting a war within herself.

She didn’t speak. She didn’t need to. The way she looked at Ji-Woon—her gaze hollow and mournful—said everything. Her lips quivered, forming words too quiet to hear. But one phrase escaped, raw and broken:

*""I went wrong...""*

With that, she turned away, disappearing behind a slammed door, a chasm of silence swallowing her grief.

His father clutched his chest, breath ragged. His fury drained into something worse—a bitter, broken despair.

""LOOK AT YOU! YOUR MOTher!"" The man gasped, as he grasped his chest from his prolonged madness.

""you said you wanted to leave, right."" is voice dropped to a low, lethal whisper. Ji-Woon nodded, his eyes stinging.

""Then... GET OUT!"" his father screamed, his voice cracking. ""FROM THIS MOMENT ON, YOU ARE NO SON OF MINE! I REFUSE YOU AS ONE OF MY OWN!"" He hurled a duffel bag at Ji-Woon’s feet.

""JI-WOON BAE IS NO LONGER A SON OF MINE! GO LIVE LIFE HOWEVER YOU WANT!"" The man collapsed to his knees, fists pounding the floor, his wails echoing through the house—a melody of anguish and shattered hope.

Ji-Woon stood still, the air heavy with a finality he couldn’t process. His eyes drifted to the small figure peeking from behind the doorway—his younger sister, her wide eyes glistening with fear and confusion.

He crouched down, gently ruffling her hair. “Take care, okay?” he whispered. She nodded, her lip trembling.

Without another word, Ji-Woon rose and stepped out of the house that no longer felt like home.

The city outside was alive—neon lights blazing, laughter and chatter swirling in the night air. But none of it touched him. Ji-Woon felt like a ghost, his presence fading against the backdrop of joy he could no longer share.

He clenched his fists, his knuckles white. *""...Fuck this.""*

He pushed through the crowd, each step taking him further away from everything he’d ever known.

**\[Graveyard, Late at Night\]**

Not a day goes by without me missing you both more than anything else in the world…

""My life has become a hollow shell without you two. I often wander into your rooms, staring at your pictures, and each time, it feels like a dagger piercing my heart. All I can experience is an overwhelming tsunami of pain, sorrow, anger, and an all-consuming desire for revenge."" Ji-Woon began, recollecting the times when all three were in one group.

Hyung and Weeju Beeju, I've managed to sneak out, drawn to your final resting place. Something within me burns intensely—anger and desperation fuel my quest for vengeance. I promise you both, I will uncover the truth, dismantle the system that led to your deaths, and hunt down those responsible.

An inexplicable presence surrounds me as I speak to your memories. It only intensifies my hunger for revenge, my determination to find those who took you from me.

I swear to you both that I will avenge your deaths—even if it costs me everything. Whether I'm left bloodied, broken, or standing at death's threshold, I will fulfil this promise. Those responsible will pay, no matter the price.

""Nun like listening to Big D while taking a dookie."" the boy quipped, a mischievous grin spreading across his face as he sat on the toilet.

His grin quickly turned to a grimace.

""Oh shit. It isn't coming out."" He braced himself, fingers gripping the edge of the stall, face contorting as he struggled.

Finally, with a strained groan, he felt the weight leave his body. Relief washed over him.

Just then, the gritty bassline of *Big D’s* track filled his headphones.

The beat kicked in. His eyes sharpened, lips curling into a smirk. Half his face was reflected in the grimy mirror on the stall door.

**""y'all just curious.""**  
He locked eyes with his reflection, defiant and amused.

**""What's up with your clothes,""**  
He stood up, pulling on his uniform with exaggerated care, as if donning royal attire.

**""hurry up and change them.""**  
He adjusted his collar, cracked his neck, and stepped out of the stall with the confidence of a man wearing brand-new boxers on New Year’s Day.

A sharp voice interrupted his strut.

“Where were you?” The words cut through the hallway, sharp and precise.

He turned his head to see a teenage girl sitting in a wheelchair. Her arms were crossed, her eyes narrowed, both curious and exasperated.

She raised an eyebrow. “A battle? Thie early? What was it?”

He leaned in, voice dropping to a mock-serious whisper.

“Constipation.”

Her eyes widened, then rolled as she groaned in disbelief. “Seriously?”

He smirked, the corners of his mouth twitching up. “Hey, it was life or death in there.”

She shook her head, trying to hide her grin. “You’re impossible.”

He shrugged, the smirk never leaving his face. “And yet, here I am.”

“Class, we’re having a new student today.”

Alex took a seat without further fanfare, her eyes briefly meeting Monaco’s and Kai’s before looking away. She exuded cool confidence like a storm quietly brewing.

A boy stood there, posture relaxed, hands tucked into his pockets as though he belonged to the darkness itself. The dim light barely grazed his features, but his sharp eyes glimmered with a hardened edge. He exhaled slowly, the vapour curling away like ghosts of unspoken thoughts.

“Tch. Back here again,” he muttered, the words tinged with bitter familiarity.

He shifted his gaze to the end of the alley, where the bright street buzzed with life — a harsh reminder of the world that seemed just out of reach.

“Soohyun…” he whispered, the name slipping from his lips like a fragment of memory too stubborn to fade.

A muffled groan broke the night’s stillness — a wet, choking sound, stifled by the cloth tied tightly around the man’s mouth. His head lolled weakly, barely supported by his broken neck.

**CRACK.**

The aluminium bat swung through the air with deadly precision, connecting with bone and flesh. The man’s skull shattered, fragments splattering against the grimy wall.

“Hah! Hole in one!” the teenager shouted, his voice dripping with twisted glee. He grinned wide, his eyes glinting with sadistic satisfaction as the bat’s impact reverberated up his arm.

“Annoying vermin,” another voice sighed. A teenage girl leaned against the wall, idly twirling a ring between her fingers. The gem embedded in it sparkled faintly under the flickering light — a sinister beauty that seemed to feed on the shadows.

The boy sneered, wiping sweat off his brow. “You’re creepy,” he muttered, his anger flaring once more as he kicked the lifeless body. “Who makes a *jewel* out of someone’s ashes?” He let the bat clatter to the ground.

The girl’s smile widened, eyes narrowing to slits. “For a bitch, she was pretty. And pretty people make pretty jewels.” She raised the ring, the light refracting off its cruel edges.

“Old man\~! You’re finally here\~” the boy drawled, throwing himself at the man with exaggerated affection.

The older man sighed, expertly disentangling himself. “Please don’t.”

“C’mon\~”

“No.”

“No fair,” the boy pouted, his grin faltering slightly.

The girl’s eyes narrowed. “Why are you here?” she asked, her tone laced with suspicion.

The man’s voice was low and measured. “Advice.” He paused, his expression cold. 

“*Не уходите в другой монастырь со своими правилами.*”

The boy scratched his head. “Huh? Put it in a language I can understand.”

“Don’t go to another monastery with your own rules,” the man translated flatly.

The boy blinked. “What does that—”

“Lay low and blend in,” the girl interrupted, her voice sharp. “He told us to.”

Recognition dawned, and their demeanour shifted instantly — the playful malice evaporated, replaced by cold calculation.

“What else did he say?” they asked in unison, their voices quiet now, almost reverent.

The older man’s gaze darkened.

1hibaeq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hibaeq,Roast Level & Phases - A more comprehensive guide with images,"Tagging on to the prior post which is more of a quick reference guide, here is a more comprehensive one for those who want more detail. Sources from The Captain’s Coffee which is a great source of information (https://thecaptainscoffee.com/pages/roast-levels)

______________________
#Unroasted Green Coffee

Green beans at room temperature. You fine folks already know what this looks like! These particular green beans are pale green as they are a South American bean (the article states they are Brazilian). Indonesian beans will be a darker green, African beans, especially Ethiopian beans, will be a bit more brown and varied in color while water processed decaf beans are very brown with a hint of green.

______________________
#Drying Coffee ~ 320 °F, 160 °C

This is coffee mid-roast and moisture in the bean is evaporating. At this point you won't hear any cracking yet and you'll be smelling a hay and sweet grass aroma. Please don't try to grind/brew/drink this coffee. It won't go well and it will taste terrible!

______________________
#Cinnamon Roast ~ 385 °F, 196 °C

The first point at which coffee becomes ""drinkable."" This roast is found at the very beginning of first crack. The coffee will have a pretty grassy taste and will still be underdeveloped, though the coffee will now begin to really smell and look like coffee. Not commonly used for home or commercial brewing. The only place you'll usually see a roast this light is for cupping samples in a professional roasting environment.

______________________
#City Roast ~ 400 °F, 205 °C (Light Roast)

Also called New England Roast. At this point in the roast, we're mid 1st crack. The coffee begins to truly smell like coffee and is actually drinkable. Coffee is frequently roasted to this level for cupping purposes as the origin can be really tasted here with little ""roast"" taste. If you really want to be able to tell the difference between two coffees, roast them to this level and taste them side by side.

______________________
#City + Roast ~ 405 - 410 °F, 207 - 210 °C (Light-Medium)

This roast is at the tail end of 1st crack and you may be still hearing the last few 1st cracks. There should be zero oil on the beans. Here you will mostly taste the individual character and origin of the coffee with very little taste of the roast, so we recommend this if you really want to taste the particular differences from one estate in the same region from another. At this point, the beans will also begin developing more body in the cup and any acidity in the coffee will be accentuated well.

______________________
#Full City Roast ~ 410 - 430 °F, 210 - 221 °C (Full Medium)

Now we're at what's commonly called ""Full Medium"". This is when 1st crack has ended but 2nd crack has not begun. The beans will be not oily to just having a few flecks of oil. You'll also notice a bit more smoke coming from your roaster. At this point there will be a balanced mixture in flavor between the individual origin of the coffee and the taste of the roasting process which is why it's so popular. We recommend this roast for most coffees as it gives the best of both worlds. You'll have a nice balance of acidity and body with most coffees at this roast level.

______________________
#Full City + ~425 - 435 °F, 218 - 224 °C (Medium-Dark)

Pulling a roast during the first few snaps of 2nd crack is sometimes called ""Full City+"". It's not quite dark enough to be called Vienna yet, but it's just past Full Medium. For some folks this is just right. There may be a few flecks of oil on the beans. There should still be a fair balance between origin and roasty flavors as well as a touch more body. There will also be less acidity if that is desired.

______________________
#Vienna Roast ~ 430 - 440 °F, 221 - 227 °C (Dark)

At this point we're really into dark roast territory. It will be the middle of second crack (what we call rolling second crack as it's consistent and not just a few cracks here and there) and there will be a clear sheen of oil on most of the beans. There will be more and more smoke coming from your roaster at this point as well. Now we really begin tasting more of the actual roasting process flavors and little origin flavor. Some very dense beans (Indonesian beans usually) can get this dark and still maintain a pretty clear origin flavor. This is also a great roast level if you like your coffee to be less acidic and bright. This is generally about as dark as we recommend going with most coffees.

______________________
#French Roast ~ 440 - 455 °F, 227 - 235 °C

We're now reaching the end of 2nd crack. The cracking will be tapering off, but still rolling for the most part. The beans will be covered in a sheen of oil that is unmistakable. There will also be lots of smoke coming from your roaster, so use caution with ventilation! The beans will also start to change color and will start to look more grey-black as than brown. At this point the coffee will have almost no origin flavor and will taste only like the ""roast,"" meaning you could roast any coffee to French Roast and it would all taste almost the same. There will be a burnt undertone to the taste and the coffee will be much ""thinner"" in texture. There should be very little acidity or brightness here. 

______________________
#Italian/Spanish Roast - Over 455 °F, 235 °C

Friends don't let friends drink charcoal. There will be tons of smoke pouring from your roaster, the aroma of the beans will be the same as burning tires and the beans will be black instead of brown. The only time you should drink this stuff is when it's a roasting accident and there's no other coffee in the house. Only slightly better than mega-store brand coffee.

______________________

Well there you have it! Please note all temperatures are approximate bean temperatures (not hot air temperatures) and will differ slightly based on variety of coffee roasted. Also, note that coffee tends to darken a bit as it ages, sometimes taking as little as a few days to darken a bit or even out what initially appears to be roasting inconsistency.

We converted to a La Marzocco after working with a one grouphead Eversys the first two years of business. 
Our volume tripled by second year and we decided to go manual with two group heads to get things out faster. Once this gm took over, he made me cut a barista off of bar and the baristas have been struggling to keep up during peak hours with just two on bar. We are pretty high traffic for a specialty shop averaging about 40-50 items an hour from the hours of 9am-12pm on a normal day that would have two baristas. 
After receiving feedback that people are waiting longer than 10 minutes for their drinks he now wants to get another piece of equipment for people who “don’t care about the quality of their coffee and want to just be in and out”.
Essentially, he wants a push button machine for just regular lattes. This is WILD to me especially since our main focus before was always the quality of our drinks. Not to mention we would have to schedule another barista on bar so we have the capacity to manage another machine. Our business model has always been a specialty coffee shop focusing on quality ingredients and a quality end product. I think I’m just massively frustrated and would love some work flow suggestions for a two barista bar flow that could get drinks out faster to make sure we’re not buying unnecessary equipment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening with the light has become a popular method for achieving a brighter, more radiant smile. Many people are eager to understand how this method works and what results they can expect. If you're considering this option, here's what you need to know.

### How Teeth Whitening with the Light Works

This method typically uses a special lamp that emits a specific type of light, often LED or laser, to enhance the whitening process. The light activates the whitening gel, which is usually made of hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide. When combined, the gel and the light work together to break down stains on your teeth.

#### Steps Involved in the Process

- **Preparation:** A dental professional will examine your teeth and may take photos for your records.
- **Application of Whitening Gel:** The gel is applied evenly to your teeth, focusing on areas with visible stains.
- **The Light Treatment:** The light is directed onto your teeth for a specific duration, usually between 15 to 30 minutes.
- **Post-Treatment Care:** After the treatment, you may receive advice on how to maintain your newly brightened smile.

### Benefits of Teeth Whitening with the Light

Choosing teeth whitening with the light can offer several advantages:

- **Fast Results:** Many individuals notice a significant difference after just one session.
- **Effective Stain Removal:** This method targets deep-set stains that standard whitening methods might not remove.
- **Safe Procedure:** When performed by a dental professional, this method is generally considered safe for your teeth and gums.

#### Considerations Before Choosing This Method

While teeth whitening with the light can be effective, it's important to consider a few factors:

- **Cost:** This method can be more expensive compared to at-home whitening kits.
- **Sensitivity:** Some individuals may experience sensitivity during or after the treatment. It’s essential to consult with your dentist beforehand.
- **Results Vary:** Factors such as the type of stains, your oral hygiene, and the condition of your teeth can impact results.

### At-Home vs. In-Office Treatments

Many people want to know how at-home teeth whitening compares to in-office treatments with light. Here are some key differences:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Efficacy:** In-office treatments typically provide quicker and more noticeable results due to professional-grade products and the focused use of light.
- **Time Commitment:** In-office whitening usually requires scheduling an appointment, while at-home kits offer more flexibility.
- **Supervision:** Professional treatments are monitored by dental experts, assuring safety and effectiveness.

### Aftercare Tips for Maintaining Your Results

Once you've achieved a brighter smile, you may wonder how to maintain those results. Here are some tips:

- **Avoid Staining Foods:** Limit intake of coffee, tea, red wine, and berries to prevent staining.
- **Practice Good Oral Hygiene:** Brush and floss regularly to keep your teeth healthy and white.
- **Consider Touch-Ups:** Depending on how your teeth respond, you might want to schedule occasional touch-up treatments.

Teeth whitening with the light can be an effective way to achieve a beautiful, whiter smile. By understanding the process, benefits, and care required, you can make an informed decision that suits your needs. Remember always to consult with your dentist to ensure the best approach for your oral health.

Comparing At-Home vs. Professional Teeth Whitening with the Light
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has gained immense popularity, and many people are eager to achieve a brighter smile. With advancements in dental technology, options like at-home teeth whitening and professional treatments have emerged. Both approaches utilize light to enhance the whitening process, but they differ significantly in effectiveness, convenience, cost, and results.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Understanding At-Home Teeth Whitening

At-home teeth whitening kits typically come with trays, strips, or gels that contain whitening agents, often hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide. Some kits also include LED lights designed to boost the whitening effect. Here’s what you can expect from this method:

- **Convenience:** You can use at-home kits in the comfort of your own space. This makes it easy to fit into your daily routine.
- **Cost:** At-home whitening solutions tend to be more affordable compared to professional treatments. Prices usually range from $20 to $200.
- **Time Commitment:** Most at-home kits require a consistent application over a few weeks to see significant results.
- **Variable Results:** While many people achieve satisfactory results, the effectiveness can vary based on the individual, the product used, and the extent of discoloration.

### The Role of Light in At-Home Whitening

The integration of light devices is a recent trend in many at-home whitening kits. The purpose of the light is to speed up the chemical reactions in the whitening gel, allowing for faster results. However, the actual effectiveness of these lights can vary. Some people may notice a difference, while others may find it negligible.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Exploring Professional Teeth Whitening

Professional teeth whitening, often provided by dentists, involves stronger whitening agents and specialized equipment. Here are some features of this option:

- **Strength and Efficacy:** Professionals use higher concentrations of bleaching agents. This often results in quicker and more noticeable outcomes.
- **Customization:** Dentists can assess your specific needs and customize the treatment to ensure optimal results.
- **Safety:** Professional treatments are performed under dental supervision, reducing the risk of damage to the gums and enamel.
- **Immediate Results:** Many patients leave their appointments with noticeably whiter teeth, often achieving their desired shade in just one visit.

### How Light Enhances Professional Whitening

During professional whitening sessions, dentists often utilize advanced light technology, such as lasers or LED lights. These methods activate the whitening gel, producing faster and more effective results. The light helps to break down stains more effectively and may even help to reduce tooth sensitivity following the treatment.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Comparing the Two Options

Choosing between at-home and professional teeth whitening with light largely depends on your personal preferences, budget, and desired outcomes. Here are some key points to consider:

- **Cost:** At-home kits are generally cheaper, but the total expense can add up if multiple products are needed.
- **Time:** Professional treatments are quicker, while at-home kits may take longer to show results.
- **Effectiveness:** Professional whitening usually provides more dramatic results, especially for deeper stains.
- **Convenience:** At-home whitening allows for flexibility, fitting into your schedule as needed.

### Making the Right Choice for You

Think about your goals when deciding between at-home and professional whitening. If you are looking for quick results and don't mind investing a bit more time in the office, professional teeth whitening is likely the way to go. On the other hand, if you prefer a budget-friendly option that allows you to control the process, at-home whitening kits may suit you better.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Regardless of which path you choose, it’s wise to consult with your dentist first. They can provide advice tailored to your dental health and ensure that any whitening treatment you pursue is suitable for you. A brighter smile is within reach, and understanding your options will lead you to the best decision for an impressive, radiant smile.

### Conclusion

Teeth whitening with the light is a popular method for achieving a brighter smile, and understanding its effectiveness is crucial for anyone considering this option. Whether you choose to go for professional treatments or opt for at-home solutions, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons. Professional treatments often deliver faster and more dramatic results due to the strength of the whitening agents and the expertise of the dental professionals. However, at-home options also provide convenience and affordability, making them an attractive choice for many people.

When comparing the two methods, it’s clear that your personal preferences and budget play significant roles in the decision-making process. If you have specific dental concerns or are looking for rapid results, visiting a dentist may be the best route. On the other hand, if you enjoy the flexibility of whitening your teeth on your own schedule, at-home kits equipped with light technology might suit you better.

Ultimately, both methods can lead to whiter teeth, boosting your confidence and enhancing your smile. It's vital to follow instructions carefully, regardless of the option chosen, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Remember to consult with a dental professional before starting any whitening process.

This week, we're diving deeper into what makes this gaming laptop so special, with a focus on its **design and build**.

**Design & Build: Where Power Meets Portability**

The Zephyrus G14 is a masterclass in blending power and portability. It's incredibly compact for a gaming laptop, weighing in at just 3.31 pounds and measuring a mere 0.63 inches thin . But don't let its size fool you – this machine is built to last.   

* **CNC Milled Aluminum Chassis:** The all-aluminum body not only looks sleek but also provides exceptional durability. It can handle the bumps and knocks of everyday life, making it perfect for students or anyone on the go.
* **Stealthy and Refined:** ASUS has ditched the ""gamer aesthetic"" for a more refined and minimalist design. It's a laptop you can confidently take to a coffee shop or a meeting without screaming ""gaming rig.""
* **Ergonomic Design:** Despite its slim profile, the G14 is comfortable to use, even during intense gaming sessions. The keyboard is well-spaced and responsive, and the large trackpad is a joy to use.
* **Effective Cooling:** The all-metal body helps dissipate heat effectively, ensuring consistent performance. While it can get warm under heavy load, it's manageable, especially with the ""ergonomic design"" that allows for good airflow.

**Beyond the Basics:**

* **AniMe Matrix LED Display:** The optional AniMe Matrix display on the lid adds a touch of personalization and flair. You can customize it with animations, text, or even system stats.
* **Sturdy Hinge:** The lid glides smoothly and doesn't wobble, even when you're moving around.
* **Premium Feel:** The overall build quality is exceptional, rivaling even the Razer Blade 14 or MacBook Pro in terms of premium feel.

**The G14 is a testament to ASUS's commitment to design and engineering.** It's a laptop that's as beautiful as it is powerful, making it a top choice for gamers and creators who demand the best.

I am a 23F, generally healthy, with minor sensitivities to alcohol and gluten. Probably have had IBS-C my entire life? Never been diagnosed, but I have dealt with a lot of gut/bathroom issues. 

I was on a semaglutide for 4 weeks (never went higher than 0.3 mgs) before discontinuing since my stomach would hurt so bad all the time. I went to the ER a couple of times since drinking even one cup of alcohol would make me throw up like crazy and I would be lying in bed for days because of the stomach pain. I get like this as well if I drink coffee on an empty stomach, which has never happened to me before. Nausea would make me leave work early, and in general, I’m in much GI discomfort 24/7, with bloating and cramps making my life difficult. Also, I was constipated for one week straight and it was such a pain to try and pass the hard stool I accumulated. 

It’s been 6 weeks since my last dose, and although I’m seeing slight improvement overall, but I’m still having very bad flare ups of GI pain/bloating/nausea. Also, I’m suspecting I’m still experiencing gastric delaying, and my appetite hasn’t fully returned. I eat maybe once a day, and I still have trouble with constipation. 

Has anyone still experienced delayed gastric emptying after 6 weeks of stopping? Is this normal? I am deathly afraid of permanent damage or gastroparesis so any insight would help!

“Mom died in December, she came to me in a dream last night with dire warnings.


She was young and beautiful again. And she told me, ""You will be blessed, and cursed, to live far longer than you wanted."" She also told me I would live to see the darkest days of man and lose so many along the way. And that I would live to see a new dawn. 

I asked her about my son, my wife, my family, my friends. She would not speak of any of them, but just told me to ""hold fast."" Her father-in-law, my grandfather, was a Navy man and Naval history nut and used the term all the time. She told me to do my best and try to keep my heart and love I have. 

She got up and walked out of the cozy coffee shop that I didn't recognize. Then the dream skipped around and it's not as clear. However, toward the end, I had the recurring dream.

I started researching about Indian estates and stumbled upon geisha coffees, soon i was in a rabbit hole of different geisha coffees. I finally got my hands on El Burro Geisha from Panama and had the one of the most balanced coffee cup ever. 

Recipe: James Hoffman Switch Recipe (with few changes) 
Grind Size: 16 Clicks on Timemore C3 
Water: 250g 
Coffee weight: 18g (I used 1:14ish)

Keep the Valve closed
Bloom phase: 60g water and swirl it 
Add rest of the water and swirl it with a tiny spoon 

At 2:00 open the valve of Hario Switch, it will take around 30s for it all to go down 
I added about 4g of honey (I’ve gotten used to adding a little bit of honey to my cups) 

Result? This coffee has little to no acidity at all but has some nice flavors to it (I can’t correctly describe them lol)

1hiauee,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/1hiauee/client_cancelinguncanceling_appointments/,Client canceling/uncanceling appointments,"So I have a client who repeatedly rescheduled/cancels appointments like a LOT. I’ve consulted with my supervisor and was advised to make sure to center the client’s wishes, ask them what they want, etc. I would love to come up with more concrete ways of doing that.

I work in a community mental health case management program where we provide some therapy but are primarily doing a lot of case management, medical accompaniment, and outreach. We are supposed to see clients about once a week.

At the beginning, there happened to be many benefits/medical appointments where the client and I spent a lot of time together and it felt like we had a warm relationship. I was there through these long boring appointments and they said they liked having me there. They seemed to trust me and be open with me (except a certain communication issue which I’ll get into).

At the moment, there is not much practical to do so we just keep making a weekly office meeting, but they keep missing it.

The particular way that they miss the appointment is driving me up the wall. Example: we agree on 2pm. At 12pm I am out doing something scheduled with another client when I hear from the front desk that my client is there. I ask them to pass on that our appointment is at 2. I hear back from front desk that the client is saying they have to reschedule with me because they’re sick. By the time I’m done with my other thing I have multiple voicemails from the client asking me to call them and reschedule because they’re sick. I then call them to reschedule and they say they are coming back to the office now since I called them.

One time I left to go on my lunch break since they had canceled (after 5 phone calls discussing if they were canceling or not) but the client was walking down the street calling me to come back because they changed their mind.

Our schedules are pretty flexible but this is too much for me, especially because they will call saying “I have to reschedule so when are we going to meet?” and sometimes I don’t have another time available. I feel really overwhelmed when this happens.

Info that seems important: I am white, they are black. There’s a history of justice involvement and being in residential treatment programs. They were referred to our program partly because they were unhappy being in their very structured previous program which felt like being in prison again. It can be hard to discuss some abstract issues with them because of a cognitive impairment but I suspect a major communication issue is learned compliance. Asking direct questions is like:

OP: it seems like meeting at this day/time doesn’t work for you, what would be your preferred time to meet?
Client: no, that’s not true, this time is fine, I’ll do it from now on (issues continue)

My supervisor pointed out the various power imbalance/trauma issues that might contribute to them not wanting to do things on my schedule. I get that. And I’m more sympathetic because the client is really nice and I don’t feel like they’re doing this just to stress me out (even though it’s really stressing me out). But I am struggling with how to bring this up in a constructive way.

Some things I have thought of:

-only meeting when we have something practical they actually want to do (even though this isn’t typical in my program)
-seeing if they would prefer going for food or coffee or meeting at home instead of the office
-offering to help with random practical things like errands
-having a hard line that we cancel for this week if they can’t make the scheduled time
-having a large window of time where we might meet and otherwise I’ll do office work. I call them and ask them if they’d like to meet and I am already available at that point.

1hiarm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminineboys/comments/1hiarm1/mid30s_advancing_towards_more_femme/,Mid-30s advancing towards more Femme,"Hello, all.

I'm a 36 YO guy and have decided to actually start advancing towards something I've kind of been wanting to for a while and go towards feminization. I will admit I have idealized the feminine and often Roleplay as women for the most part. A friend just listened to me and pushed me to go towards the work to dress how I'd like and got an outfit that was similar to one I have used for a few characters I played before.

I am actually looking towards advice on feminization. I am currently 240lbs, have started a diet which is basically I'm cutting all my food intake in half. Prepare a plate, half it and save the second half for later, Stopped drinking sodas, only have one cup of coffee a day, and stopped buying junk food as chips and have replaced my snacks with steaming broccoli as a friend advised that, which I like anyways, so is lucky there.

As for my new beauty routine I have changed out normal bar soap and amd using a loofah as an exfoliant along with foaming exfoliating body wash. I got Clean & Clear face wash, CeraVe for general Moisturizer that I use for my face, knees, elbows and shoulders, and a L'Oreal Collagen facial moisturizer that I apply first thing in the morning and right before I go to bed. Currently have Burt's Bees Overnight Lip Treatment as well to help soften my lips. The last thing I have been adding is  some Dr. Scholl's Feet Moisturizer to help with my rough heels.

I admit, I am fairly masculine to begin with, right now, but have been working on this treatment for about 2 weeks, but would like a bit more advice on some good skin treatments or some such that isn't too intrusive. I live with others, at this point, and don't want to bother them... or even really be noticed until I have worked on it a while and am sure I want to keep with the aesthetic. I do have facial hair currently just because it's easier than shaving every day, currently, along with body hair including arms and legs, but have decided if everything is going well to go with a full body wax after 3 months and maintain it afterwards.

I will mention I am not trans. I don't have dysphoria with my body, nor euphoria with the idea of being an actual woman, I just enjoy the feminine aesthetics significantly more than the masculine aesthetics and feel I'd be happy with the look and ability to dress more feminine while following with the more feminine bodily appearance. I don't have to be super thin, as I also like the kind of chubby motherly appearance so am not looking to shed a hundred pounds, but, at least, try to trim my stomach. I am doing light exercise along with the diet to try and work that.

I do also want to try and get a lighter voice. My voice isn't really gruff and manly, but is obviously masculine. I did want to try and feminize it and have looked to a couple guides and have been doing some practice, but the results are moderate, then again, only been doing it for a month and not consistently due to the aforementioned not wanting to bother others I live with.

For any advice I'd like to know if anyone could give some decent body/facial care routines or products that is suggested. Cheap is nice, but if there's some large bi yearly or semi annually purchases for products I can plan around that by the time my current products are used! I'd also like any voice feminization guides without the requirement of estrogen. I'm not interested in taking estrogen or any medication, but if it's over-the-counter it may assist if it's something simple.

Thank you, anyone that will give any such advice. As a show of the possible transformation, let's go with the start point of my first put together outfit and see how it goes from here!

Recently invested in a Profitec Pro 500 with PID. Have a few questions:

1. I want to ask what the quantity of the double basket is? I’ve tried 17 to 20 gm but get similar results. 

2. When I pull the brew lever down after extraction, some coffee still drips from the portafilter and that increases the 1:2 ratio output. Is that expected?

3. After brewing and cleaning the group head, I leave the portafilter on the machine and when I take it off the next day, the basket tends to stick with the group head and comes off slightly when the portafilter is removed. Is this normal?

4. The puck in the portafilter has some water on top when I take it out and puck is wet, not dry/cake like. I’m using a finer grind and if I go any finer, it takes longer to extract so I know my grind is perfectly fine. What can I do to fix this?

5. Sometimes when I backflush with just water (using the blind basket), nothing comes out of the three way solenoid pressure release outlet. Is that normal?

Sorry if any question was dumb or too obvious. I truly would appreciate any help and guidance regarding my questions. ",1,1734665083.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Nose: Wow. This is really nice. I get gingerbread and lots of sweet icing. Orange notes mix in that make me think of creamsicle. Coffee notes pop out as well.

Palate: That wonderful creamsicle note is the first note to hit my tongue. Really delicious. The orange notes then begin to dominate. Very light on the palate. Sweet and simple. The orange notes are really refreshing and nice. 

Finish: Smokey and really peppery. Subtle green pepper lingers for a bit. Moderate in length, nice hug. Interesting end to it all

In my opinion i believe these are ayesha’s 3 most catchy songs


Girl Next Door- I think girl next door is probably ayeshas most catchy song- my friends like ayesha’s music, but only really listen to her when they’re with me- expect this song.
they got this shit in their own playlists and it’s the song we probably burst out singing the most. this was the first song of hers that got stuck in my head and also got me really into ayesha’s other music. 


Coffee Cake- I’m picking coffee cake because it’s only been leaked for like 9 days and i got it stuck in all my coworkers heads already. they love the first verse “do you have a debit card, do you think i could use it? promise i won’t lose it, just wanna buy some new shit” they have been singing it alllll week. ive already streamed it more than a  1/4 of all ayesha’s other songs- cause i have also been singing it allll week lol.


Do What U Do- i almost picked “a little bit famous” just because i think the song flows really well and is easy to get stuck in your head- BUT i chose “do what u do” instead. i think it’s a bit more catchy and i find myself singing it quite a bit, but what really made me chose it is the fact that my best friends boyfriend is ALWAYS singing it. he will be cooking in our kitchen and i just randomly hear “can’t afford the bar, got some xanax in my dresser”. the only reason why im even taking his opinion is cause he doesn’t fuck with any of ayesha’s other music- hes way to straight for that lmao, so it must mean do what u do is quite catchy if he’s always singing it right?? don’t blame him",2,1734664352.0,AyeshaErotica,1,1.0,False
1hiaiox,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPS/comments/1hiaiox/how_do_judges_feel_about_moving_to_better_ones/,How do judges feel about moving to better ones situation when kids in care?,"I (36F) have a friend who is who ill call A for this post (27F), had her kids were removed almost 2 years ago for the second time due to  an altercation with her mother and her sister.  


**For some context:**  
*A had been living at her mothers  house with her two kids, and things had been rocky between the two of them for awhile, A had moved into her parents home due to a loss of income and being unable to pay for her old place, however while living at her parents she was able to get onto social assistance and while living with her parents she  paid for Groceries, helped cook, cleaned, took care of her kids, if she went out she took the kids with, even though they did say on weekends as long as they were sleeping they she could go for coffee or what not.*

*A's mom is very dramatic, controlling type of woman normally and always has been with A when it's come to her children, Her solution any time A has come to her with help or anything is to just give her the children if she can't properly care for them.*

 

so basically  from what I know A was able to find housing after living with her parents for 6-10 months, and was going to be moving the following day that this altercation occured in her own words:

  
*We were all sitting outside it was me, two sisters, my sisters boyfriend, mom and stepdad. I told my family I got a place and was getting my keys the next day, I explained that it’s been vacant for a few months. My sister said “you should be more vigilant about where you live.” I told her it was not her business and that I had put 1800 into this place and when I looked at it it was fine. I then walked away into the house to go do dishes, my sister followed into the house and walked passed me with a huff and puff. I asked her why she did that and she said “because you did it to me when I was trying to talk to you” I told her “I walked away because I wasn’t going to argue over anything”* 



*She goes the back, walks to the front through the gate, tells my mom “some people just shouldn’t have their kids” I got upset because my kids has nothing to do with the situation and should never have been brought up. I made the mistake in smacking my sister on the arm (enough to say knock it off) and then my mother chased me out of the yard away from children and because I still have trauma I am working through I made the mistake of punching her.* 



*I got arrested without questions being asked at all, I told the officer I had someone coming to get me and I was leaving with my children, I still got arrested and my parents told cps I abandoned my children. I was not aware of the apprehension until a week later through email.*

Since then the children have remained in her parents care, A has attended anger management, did programing she was required to (however they failed to submit any documents to CPS), she is also required to find suitable housing (which in our town is near impossible and even low income housing units have 2-4 wait lists), she has attended her visits but has admittly missed a few due to weather, and another time was due to illness.  
due to the way CPS runs things time wise, CPS came to her lawyer who then basically pressured her into singing a document the idea of signing her kids over until they were 18 so that her parents could raise them, and this would make getting her kids back easier when she was ready, biggest mistake that anyone could of made.

Since then her mother is now in charge of Scheduling visits, she will only let her have supervised visits for 2 hours per week, she will not compromise at all, blames everything that occured on A, She will not even let her come to holidays anymore, she has basically been disincluded in the family,  but her sister who literally started this whole thing, spends regular time with A's kids and also  is aloud to come to holidays and family fucntions.  
to A has tried to talk, reconcile etc, but her mother is having non of it!, she tells her you created this mess.   
Her entire family see's her as the issue, and it is greatly discouraging her, because of this she has zero support system, she doesnt deny that she held accountablity but she feels they are using her kids against her and treating her like she is dangerous, when she made a bad choice!

A has been trying to find a job but every job she has applied to either doesnt call back, or straight denies her for one reason or another, She is living as a roommate right now cause thats all she can afford/find at the moment, she really feels like she needs a fresh start, move somelace that has employment to offer, and get away from the negativity, however she is worried that this would be looked at as further abandonment and held against her by a judge if she did go back to court when she is in a better place to be a mother to her kids, Im thinking not as it is the same province and shes trying to better herself, but due to all that background and such how do courts feel when parents move to better themselves? is there anything she can do to improve her situation?

i want to add there is no worker now, and even when there was no one listened to her concerns

First off, it really depends on what you stored in them. I've found that bags used for dry foods like cereals, nuts, or coffee beans can typically be reused several times. Just wash them thoroughly with warm soapy water, rinse well, and let them dry completely before reusing.

However, if you've stored raw meat, fish, or very oily foods, it's better to just toss the bag. Trust me, I learned this the hard way when I tried reusing a bag that had stored salmon - not a great idea!

One thing that's really helped me save money is investing in a quality vacuum sealer. I personally use this one from Amazon (https://athometouch.com/vacuumsealer) and it's been a game-changer. The bags it comes with are sturdy enough to be reused multiple times.

Here's a pro tip: cut the bags a bit longer than you need initially. This way, when you need to reseal them, you'll have enough material to work with after cutting off the previous seal.

I've also discovered that proper cleaning is crucial for reusing these bags. Here's my method:
- Turn the bag inside out
- Use warm water and mild dish soap
- Rinse thoroughly
- Air dry completely (I usually hang them)
- Check for any damage before reusing

For those interested in getting started with vacuum sealing, I can't recommend this vacuum sealer enough (https://athometouch.com/vacuumsealer). It's perfect for beginners and comes with everything you need to get started.

Something important to note: the heavy-duty, textured bags tend to last longer and can be reused more times than the thinner ones. While they might cost a bit more initially, they're more cost-effective in the long run.

Remember, just because you can reuse vacuum seal bags doesn't always mean you should. Always use your best judgment and when in doubt, use a new bag. Food safety should always come first!

I've found that using vacuum seal bags has saved me tons of money on food waste, and being able to reuse them is just an added bonus. Hope this helps answer some questions about reusing vacuum seal bags!",1,1734663956.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

1hiadk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1hiadk1/living_with_acid_reflux/,Living with Acid reflux,"This is my story of reclaiming my life from the grips of chronic acid reflux (GERD). It's not just about managing symptoms – it's about understanding my body and making peace with my digestive system.

For years, I lived in fear of food. Every meal felt like a gamble. Would this be the one that sends me into a spiral of heartburn, regurgitation, and that terrible burning sensation in my chest? I'd wake up coughing in the middle of the night, my throat raw from stomach acid. Simple pleasures like coffee with friends or enjoying a family dinner became sources of anxiety.

The turning point wasn't finding the perfect medication (though those helped). It was realizing that my digestive system wasn't my enemy – it was sending me important messages that I needed to learn to understand.

The first breakthrough came when I started treating my esophagus as a sensitive friend rather than a broken machine. Instead of just popping antacids and hoping for the best, I began paying attention to patterns. Which foods triggered symptoms? What times of day were worst? How did stress affect my digestion?

I discovered that my reflux wasn't just about what I ate – it was about how I ate. Rushing through meals during lunch breaks, eating large portions late at night, and stress-eating while working were all contributing to my symptoms. My body wasn't malfunctioning; it was begging me to slow down.

Meal timing became my secret weapon. Rather than three large meals, I switched to smaller, more frequent portions that didn't put as much pressure on my lower esophageal sphincter. I learned to eat dinner at least three hours before bed, giving my stomach time to empty before lying down.

Posture played a surprisingly important role. Simply sitting up straight during meals and avoiding slouching at my desk made a noticeable difference. I started taking short walks after meals instead of immediately returning to work or collapsing on the couch.

The hardest part? Saying goodbye to some of my favorite foods. Tomato-based sauces, citrus fruits, chocolate, and my beloved morning coffee were major triggers. But instead of viewing this as deprivation, I turned it into an adventure of finding new favorites. I discovered the joy of herbal teas, learned to make creamy non-acidic sauces, and found ways to add flavor without aggravating my symptoms.

Sleep became a crucial focus. Elevating the head of my bed (not just using extra pillows) made a dramatic difference in my nighttime symptoms. Creating a relaxing bedtime routine helped reduce stress-related acid production.

Speaking of stress – it was perhaps the biggest revelation. During particularly stressful periods, my symptoms would flare regardless of what I ate. This led me to explore stress management techniques like meditation, deep breathing, and gentle yoga. These practices didn't just help my reflux; they improved my overall quality of life.

Building a supportive medical team was essential. Finding a doctor who listened to my concerns and worked with me to find the right combination of lifestyle changes and medications made all the difference. We discovered that my reflux was worse during certain times of the month, allowing me to anticipate and prepare for challenging periods.

I learned to assemble a toolkit for flare-ups: loose, comfortable clothing, natural remedies like ginger tea and aloe vera juice, breathing exercises, and positioning techniques. Having these tools ready helped reduce the anxiety around potential symptoms.

The most unexpected lesson? How interconnected our digestive health is with our emotional well-being. As I learned to listen to my body's signals and respond with compassion rather than frustration, both my symptoms and my stress levels improved.

To anyone struggling with GERD – know that you're not alone. This condition can be isolating and frustrating, but there is hope. Your journey might look different from mine, but healing is possible. It's not just about finding the right medications or eliminating trigger foods; it's about creating a lifestyle that supports your digestive health.

Take it one day at a time. Celebrate small victories. Be patient with yourself as you learn your triggers and find your balance. Your body isn't fighting against you – it's trying to communicate with you.

Remember, managing acid reflux is a journey, not a destination. There will be good days and challenging days, but with understanding, patience, and the right support, you can find your path to healing.

I am genuinely confused- I have A PC attaching the specs as an image to this.

So it’s been about a year+ I used this pc and have always ran into the same issues. It works completely fine for a couple of weeks/month and then it starts crashing randomly on games. 

I’ve played games like spiderman / apex and it’ll be working fine till one day it’s not. 

There is no warning for the crash, just straight shuts off. I can use web browsing and shit all day long no crashes but when I load a game it keeps crashing.

I’ve got the cooler fan changed, PSU is legit got that checked. I’ve gotten it cleaned and reset but after a good 1/2 weeks of working it just does the same thing. 

All the drivers are up to date

Please help it’s starting to piss me off to the point where I wanna just throw the screen against a wall. It’s basically becoming a giant YouTube machine at this point. The games I’m running aren’t that big either like it’ll crash on very simple games",1,1734663774.0,pcmasterrace,1,1.0,False

I’m new to drinking coffee. I bought my first Nespresso machine (Vertuo Next). 

I’m looking for some recommendations as to what to get. So far I am testing the 12 samples it came with. I normally drink one cup of coffee a day. My usual go to caffeine in the past was Coke Zero but since then, I’ve been appreciating coffee a bit more. 

When I buy coffee outside, I really like Starbucks and I usually go for a Non-Dairy Caramel Macchiato or a Cold Brew (no milk, just black coffee). Outside Starbucks, I also get an iced Americano. 

I make my own instant coffee and I really enjoy illy’s Classico blend due to its sweet after taste. I also bought myself cans of their very own iced coffee. 

With Nespresso, so far I have tried and enjoyed: 
- Stormio (though I find it a little too strong for my liking but I’d still drink it)
- Melozio 

I don’t add anything to my coffee. I like them plain. The foam doesn’t matter to me and I usually wait for my coffee to get colder. Sometimes I add ice cubes after it cools down. 

Any suggestions are welcome based on what I have tried so far.

However, I've had very limited success with it on myself (even with acutes).  That, and, after seeing a homeopath for the better part of a year, even SHE could not get a single remedy to budge my chronic or acute symptoms one bit.

So, for whatever reason, I seem to be somewhat ""immune"" to homeopathy.  I have a cousin who shares this experience, FWIW.

There are a handful of remedies that worked on me, found on my own without the homeopath, and they are: Belladonna 200C for an acute delirious fever, Borax 1M for itchy back and shoulders in bed, and Apis 1M for a slightly different itch.  The successes with the itches were a big deal to me since they are a huge part of my chronic picture and my main debilitating symptom.  The itch seems to keep changing, though, and those things no longer help.

Insofar as reasons I might not be responsive to homeopathy:

* Autism spectrum
* Chronic gut issues since infanthood
* MCAS/histamine intolerance
* Trauma/betrayal with many repeated experiences destroying my ability to trust
* Toxic emotional situations in my everyday life

I eat very healthfully and take good care of myself.  I'm mindful of EMFs.  I've completed several multi-day water fasts to improve my general health.  I don't usually drink coffee and have tried many periods with non-mint toothpaste as an experiment, and it doesn't seem to make a difference.  In summary, I'm aware of the things that tend to neutralize remedies and take steps to avoid them, and so my inability to respond to remedies in general is a very frustrating thing, especially when I see that it does work for others.

I've used the ABC Homeopathy remedy finder, AI, a real homeopath that cost lots of $, and my own research (books/online).  I've used Banerji protocols and tried repertorizing things.  I simply don't know what else to try.

What can be done?

What are some good resources for this situation?

Are there any affordable homeopaths who specialize in complex cases such as mine who see clients online?

Just looking for some answers here.  I don't want to give up hope.  Thanks.",1,1734663534.0,homeopathy,0,1.0,False
1hia9gc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hia9gc/aita_for_over_paying_all_the_time/,AITA for over paying all the time? ,"So where do I even start with this. I had this friend and we'll call him M.N. I knew him for a long time since high school days. I had lost contact with him and until a few years ago when we had reconnected again.  

I had seen he was working in the trades but working for his uncle doing general renovations making $20/hr. Or something along those lines.  He said he wanted to specialize in what I was doing but was not able to attend the training program because he only had 4 highschool credits and they needed a minimum of highschool or equivalent. So anyways I had taken him under my wing to work with me and I would train him myself. I told him I would pay him $25/hr which was more than what he was making with his uncle. 

I had this one job that he had worked for me on. There were days on the job when we wouldn't work a full 8 hours but I would pay him for the full day anyways which I did out of my own generosity. It was everyday that would happen but some days it did so I considered it like a little bonus plus it made keep track of payment for him a lot easier. 

Fast forward to the end of the job now and ive paid him the rest of the money I've owed him for the week. He gets home and calls me to tell me I'm short on his money. I thought it was very strange but we're all humans and mistakes happen. I told him that there's no problem and we can get to the bottom of any mix up. I know that It was almost impossible for me to have shorted him money because of the days we didn't work a full 8 hours I had paid him for 8 hours, so if anything I over paid him. Plus I told him it's very easy for us to find out the hours worked because I can check Google history and that will give us a rough timeline of when we arrived and left the job site. 

So after clearing all that up he had realized that it was his communication to his wife which led him to mark down the wrong hours. Mind you M.N. has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and other mental disorders and it's very very severe. That has a lot to do with how he thinks and operates and just goes about his life. This also affects how he thinks and makes judgments. I understand what he's going though so I'm not hard on him at all. I explained to him that it was all just a big misunderstanding and I would never screw him over or anyone that has worked for me. 

So time passes by and he ends up going back to work for his uncle and I go back to working for a company. He still wants to get into the trades which we are unionized but he can't because he only has 4 credits. I end up meeting someone and I helped him get into the company though a loophole where he didn't need to have his highschool diploma. Upon getting him into the company there was a mix-up where he got paid full journeyman salary $40+ where he should have only been paid an apprentice salary which was $20. After him receiving several paychecks at full journeyman rate I told him he should check with the boss to make sure that there was no misunderstanding to his pay rate. I kept telling him to check with the boss but he insisted he and see ""what would happen."" After a couple months go by he finally checks with the boss and finds out that there was a big mistake and he should only be paid an apprentice rate because the last three guys in the company that lied about their rate got fired. The boss was very happy and thanked him for his ""honesty."" Loll. 

Now a bit of time goes by and M.N. uncle asked if I wanted to do a job for him. I was very hesitant to because I was already working full-time during the day and doing a side job would kill me. So I had priced the job very high at $6,000 but the job itself was only worth $2,000. Anyways he gave me the job and asked when it could start. M.N was going to help on his this job and mind you he is still an apprentice. After the job is done M.N. had only worked a total of 20 hours on the job but I had paid him $2200. My father who helped on the job I paid him $800 and I took home $3000. Which gives us the total of $6000 for the price of the job. My payment to M.N I thought was very fair for only working 20 hours. 

Some time has gone by now and we haven't seen each other and now we're back on the same job site.  On this job site particularly he's responsible for getting coffees for everybody because he's The coffee runner. The first day he forgets my coffee which I understand mistakes happen you forget whatever. The second day he forgets my coffee again so I asked him why did you forget my coffee, he looks me in the eye and he tells me to go get my own fucking coffee. I had asked him what happened what's with the bad blood?? And he told me that I fucked him on his uncle's job. So I immediately thought am I the asshole for paying him $2200 for working 20 hours or is there something that's I've missed?!!!!",2,1734663493.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

1hia7bu,https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1hia7bu/my_experience_incomplete_exam_bc_of_insufficient/,My experience: incomplete exam b/c of insufficient prep,"Hi everyone, I’m had my first-ever colonoscopy this week and thought I’d create an account and share my experience, for what it’s worth for the sub and to process my thoughts.  In short, I’m very disappointed that I’ll have to do this again but at least I’m not scared of the procedure itself now, and with more knowledge I might have a better chance at fully cleansing next time around.  (Sorry for how long this got.)


Background: 

49, male, U.S. resident, slim, generally good health and diet.  My first screening was with the Cologuard test a few years ago, but I had told myself to get a colonoscopy the next time around for more peace of mind.  I was very ignorant of the process until recently (embarrassingly, I didn’t even realize “colon” = “large intestine” and not just the rectal and nearby areas – I had no idea a colonoscopy looks at the entire large intestine!).  My primary care doctor referred me to a GI doctor, I set up an appointment time, I picked up the assigned prep (Lupin generic Suprep split-dose), and I did an initial pre-op interview with a screening nurse.  I was not laser-focused on this process in the beginning, but I figured that if I followed the instructions, everything should work out fine.

Prep: 

My procedure was scheduled for 1:30 pm on a Monday.  Based on the instructions, I went on a low-residue/low-fiber diet starting the Friday before. On that final Thursday before, there was a big office holiday party, and I pigged out much of the day.  I also had stopped medications and supplements, except Wellbutrin 300 mg/day, around that Tuesday before. For the diet, I ate eggs, fish, pasta, black coffee with sugar (I now realize I could have included my regular soy milk with this part of the diet), water, avocados, olive oil, plant-based “butter,” lots of white bread, and lots of cheese, including cottage cheese. I normally never eat white bread or much cheese, so this seemed like a treat to me.  On the clear liquid diet and prep day (Sunday), I had coffee with sugar and cinnamon, water, and lemon-lime Gatorade.

That Sunday I grew anxious about staring the prep and put it off, but I finally started on the first 6-ounce Suprep bottle around 4:15 pm (within the directed 3 pm to 6 pm window).  I hadn’t thought to chill the Suprep, so it was at room temperature, but the water I added to it was cold.  The taste wasn’t pleasant as we all know; kind of a salty-warm flavor.  But it was only 16 ounces (the Suprep plus 10 ounces of water) to get through.  After a first few swallows, the aftertaste was pretty bad, but holding my nose helped a lot.  I got through it in maybe 10 minutes.  The instructions said to drink two additional 16-ounce servings of water within the next hour, and here I was a bit lackadaisical.  Also, the instructions said to remain standing during this time, but to be honest I mainly remained on the couch, watching a football game.

I waited for the Suprep to kick in … and nothing was happening.  I felt rumblings from time to time and slight bowel movement urges of the kind where, if I did go, I knew it would come out as diarrhea.  But I didn’t feel an overwhelming urge to run to the bathroom, as I’d seen other people describe.  I’ve certainly been in truly emergency situations where I needed to get to a toilet ASAP, but that wasn’t the case here at all.  During the prep I didn’t expect to be able to control when I’d go.  After about three and half hours, I got panicky. I assumed it just wasn’t going to work for me for whatever reason. I started Googling about what to do if the prep isn’t working. I decided to do this MiraLAX prep (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXk-pqiy8n0&t=499s), which I learned about on the fly, but I figured anything was worth a shot since it was getting so late.  I dashed to the pharmacy before it closed, got the ingredients, and followed the regimen as best I could, given the time restraints.  I took two tablets of Dulcolax, followed by drinking the MiraLAX mixed in Gatorade (in a smaller Gatorade bottle than suggested in that video, though).  Then later, two more tablets of Dulcolax.  I planned on drinking Magnesium Citrate the next morning, the morning of the procedure.  I was still pessimistic and wrote to the GI provider’s office through their online portal, explaining what I was doing but advising that I’d probably have to cancel the procedure in the morning.

But at some point I did start having bowel movements, based on a bit more “urgency” but not “emergency,” if that makes sense. I still generally felt in control, and I had to push out a bowel movement to get it going, like under normal circumstances.  Only now what was coming out was more and more liquid.  I was not on the toilet all the time, but went back to it time and again, sometimes making myself go just to get more out. It really did progress to essentially “peeing” out of my butt, and it felt gross.  
From lots of frantic Googling that evening, I learned that the stool should not only be liquid, but that it should be clear, or at least a yellow-ish tint. I certainly felt that I was expelling everything, even though my liquid stool remained brown.  I figured that having liquid, though brown, stool would be good enough to at least take a shot at the procedure the next day.  I assumed that most patients don’t have a perfect prep and that the doctors have ways to address that (e.g., I knew that the colonoscope had a “hose” and thought the doctor might be able to wash away any remaining liquid my colon lining as needed).  

It still was very nerve-wracking to not know if my prep would be enough.  At this point it was well past midnight, but I wasn’t able to sleep at all.  I would make myself go to the bathroom from time to time just to keep trying to flush everything out.  I got spun up online reading and watching videos about preps, the procedure, colorectal cancer treatment and prognosis, etc.   I also was scared about the procedure itself.  I’d never had to go to the hospital for myself before, never been put under anesthesia or sedation.  Basically, I was extremely anxious about the prep not working and on top of that, actually going through with the procedure.
I was up all night, and when 7 am rolled around, I went ahead with the second Suprep dose.  Being really exhausted seemed to make it worse than the first time; I was a bit more nauseated by it.  This time I did a Gatorade “chaser” in between rounds of swallowing the Suprep, and that helped.  I had more bowel movements and, lo and behold, they were pretty clear and nice and yellow!  I took photos of the final results in the toilet just in case they’d want “evidence” that I’d done my prep. But I felt so relieved.  I thought I had gotten over the biggest hurdle and just needed to push through with the procedure and have this whole thing behind me.  I wrote back to the GI provider’s office with this positive update.

Procedure:

Not having been admitted to the hospital before, everything was a bit scary to me – being greeted by various medical professionals, handed a gown (I wasn’t sure how to tie it correctly), provided a gurney.  And then of course the procedure itself and being knocked out for it.  It’s kind of like getting on plane – statistically you know flying is routine and safe, but it’s nonetheless unnerving and surreal. (Flying in metal tube tens of thousands of feet in the air? Being put to sleep and having a hose snaked through your intestine?)  Like flying, you just have to let go and trust that those in charge know what they’re doing and that the technology will work the way it’s supposed to.  Also, there’s always a first time you have do something, and if you’re scared to do it, nothing anyone says can fully reassure you.  Friends of mine and people online said the same thing – you just go to sleep and when you wake up it’s all over, and you don’t remember anything…. and that’s exactly what happened. (In my specific case, I had the sedation under propofol.) 

Basically, I arrived at the hospital, checked in, and soon was called in by a nurse. I was led to a pre-op/holding room, where I stripped and put on the gown, and sat on the gurney.  Nurses came in and asked questions, took some measurements, set up the IV line.  Another medical professional explained the propofol.  (I actually wasn’t sure what sedation/anesthesia I’d be under until he told me, and I was glad propofol was the plan.)  I signed several forms.  I was really nervous the whole time, and I told the staff that.  They were all understanding.  The GI doctor who was doing my procedure was doing another colonoscopy, so I waited in the pre-op room for a while, just looking at my phone and resting.  I was still nervous but also exhausted and ready to get it over with.  Eventually another nurse came in when it was time for the procedure.  Right at that point I’d been looking up on my phone whether it’s possible for a patient to have a bowel movement during the procedure – because I was feeling another urge to go.  I asked the nurse about this as she pushed me down the hall toward the procedure room.  (I think she said that they can handle that situation, but I got the sense from my quick search online that it doesn’t really happen, and it didn’t in my case.)

Things kind of moved quickly in the procedure room – new medical professionals introduced themselves, one specifically in charge of the propofol.  That anesthesiologist was understanding about my fears and like others said I’d just be enjoying a deep sleep.  An oxygen supply was placed in my nose.  I put my phone in airplane mode and the staff placed that and my glasses off to the side.  The GI doctor came in and briefly introduced herself, explained the procedure, including providing what seemed like standard risk warnings (which I’m sure were in the papers I signed). I was still nervous this whole time, and it seemed like lots of things were happening, and happening fast.  Soon I was instructed to sit on my left side and curl my legs up a bit like in a sleeping position. It was “go time.”  The anesthesiologist said he was about to administer the and that soon I’d be going to sleep.  The last thing I remember is talking to him or trying to, asking him whether he was sure the propofol would work on me, and really just trying to talk to show that I was still awake (and so for them not to start the procedure). Obviously, I didn’t stay awake. I don’t know for sure, but it feels like I might have gone under in a matter of seconds.

And then I just woke up and learned that the procedure was over.  I was greeted by one of the nurses.  I think at that point she explained that they had already contacted my friend who would be driving me home.  It took me a few moments to realize I wasn’t in the procedure room but back in the holding room where I’d started.

Results:

The GI doctor came in and explained the results. I was so surprised and disappointed to hear that there was stool throughout my colon and that she couldn’t do a complete exam.  I really felt from the morning bowel movements’ color that morning that I had cleared everything out sufficiently.  Her report said there was stool in the entire examined colon.  She did say that of the areas she could examine, she didn’t find anything.  Her report includes seven procedure images from different parts of my colon, all of which but one say “otherwise normal,” and I’m not sure what that means.  For the transverse colon photo, it just says “stool,” so she must not have been able to check much of that section at all.  The report also says tortuous colon, and in our brief chat we didn’t cover that. I’m now learning what that is, and I wonder if having that makes a successful prep harder to achieve?  She said that I should plan on another exam within a year and that we talk about follow-up plans.  I’ll be meeting with her in February.

Reflections/questions:

- I didn’t realize that I was supposed to take an active role in clearing my colon out.  Next time I’ll view this as my mission in life, and if I need to “break the seal” to get things going, I’ll do that, instead of just waiting for overwhelming urges to go.  And I’ll take or do whatever else might help, as long as the doctor says it’s OK. 

- To me the dreaded “prep” has many aspects to it, with varying levels of difficulty; based on my experience, I’d break it down this way, from easiest to tolerate to hardest: (5) The low-residue/low-fiber diet (I found this easy to follow; just give me a list of approved foods and I’ll stick to them as long as necessary – two days, a week, a month, whatever); (4) The clear liquid diet (inconvenient and draining, as I don’t fast much, but I saw it as a challenge and actually probably a healthy thing to do, though more than one or two days would be pretty hard); (3) The bowel prep medicine (unpleasant and gross, but at least with Suprep, just two limited doses, mitigated by drinking a chaser and holding my nose); (2) The bowel movements (I didn’t like the feeling of “peeing” out of my butt, over and over again; having to study the nasty results in the toilet, hoping for them to get clearer and clearer; the smell, the wiping, etc.); and (1) The uncertainty that all these efforts will allow for a successful exam (it’s really disheartening to go through all this work and not have it pay off, and then know you have to do it again without knowing it’ll pay off).

- On the good side, I’m not afraid of the procedure itself anymore, and I know a bit more about how the prep is supposed to go.

- I’m wondering if eating so much right before starting the low-residue diet was a factor, as well as eating so much white bread and cheese during the diet?

- Maybe doing a week of low-residue and low-calorie diet would help?

- Maybe doing a two-day clear liquid diet, if possible, would help?

- If safe, could I take the prep medicine a full two rounds (e.g., for Suprep, four doses)?

- If safe, could I add in to any prescribed prep the full MiraLAX, Dulcolax, and Magnesium Citrate prep?

- How many days would I need to fast to be 100% everything was cleared out?  For instance, I think I’ve read that it takes 3-4 days for food to fully move through you?

- Are any prep medicines known to be the “strongest,” even if most difficult to down?  

- Would my doctor be able to tell if my stool could have been expelled with more time and bowel movements, as opposed to it being “stuck” in my colon?

- Would my doctor be able to give a percentage of what she could check?

- Is there any “irrigation” they can do to help clear me out, like a colonic?

- Would a colonic help?",3,1734663298.0,colonoscopy,1,1.0,False

I’m new to drinking coffee. I bought my first Nespresso machine (Vertuo Next). 

I’m looking for some recommendations as to what to get. So far I am testing the 12 samples it came with. I normally drink one cup of coffee a day. My usual go to caffeine in the past was Coke Zero but since then, I’ve been appreciating coffee a bit more. 

When I buy coffee outside, I really like Starbucks and I usually go for a Non-Dairy Caramel Macchiato or a Cold Brew (no milk, just black coffee). Outside Starbucks, I also get an iced Americano. 

I make my own instant coffee and I really enjoy illy’s Classico blend due to its sweet after taste. I also bought myself cans of their very own iced coffee. 

With Nespresso, so far I have tried and enjoyed: 
- Stormio (though I find it a little too strong for my liking but I’d still drink it)
- Melozio 

I don’t add anything to my coffee. I like them plain. The foam doesn’t matter to me and I usually wait for my coffee to get colder. Sometimes I add ice cubes after it cools down. 

Any suggestions are welcome based on what I have tried so far. 

Thank you all in advance :) ",1,1734663052.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

The book completely subverted all the tropes I generally expect from a fantasy novel and hit me with something fresh and beautiful, and utterly wholesome. After spending this whole year reading high fantasy with high stakes, Legends and Lattes was a breath of fresh air and coziness.

I loved the characters, especially Thimble. Never knew I needed a Rat Baker in my life before, and the voice Travis Baldree gives him in the audiobook is just cherry on top, so cute.

Ok, so here is our story. A few years ago my husband started to become really short tempered and irritable in general. When asked about it he would snap and say nothing is wrong and he's always been this way. 

Then he seemed to start funneling those negative emotions directly to me. He blamed me for everything, every angry outburst or bad feeling.

When his anger started to become more prevalent, when he started to become more irritable and unpredictable I began looking into possible hormonal or mental health issues he might be dealing with. There is an article on “A Train Education” about irritable male syndrome that, from my perspective, describes us perfectly. That’s the problem though. It’s MY perspective and I need that of a middle aged man. 

Over the years he has, in my opinion and those of our kids, escalated. He basically hates me. He accuses me of feeling/doing and being all kinds of things that couldn't be further from what I'm feeling/doing or who I am as a person. 

He has spent over 10k easy at bars in the last year and when he's not calling me names or yelling at me he is ignoring me. I mean hard refusal to make eye contact or respond to me at all whether I want to talk about something serious or just ask him how his day was or if he wants some more coffee. He just doesn't respond and when I ask again (honestly hoping each time that he just didn't hear me) he blows up and says I am mentally ill and just need to create conflict.

He won't self reflect, won't go to a medical doctor, won't consider hormone testing or antidepressants, only comes to maybe 1 out of 3 therapy sessions where he doesn't share and often storms out early. 

He keeps saying we are done but then acts like nothing has changed when we get home and gets angry when I try to figure out next steps to separate.

So what's his deal? Is it medical? Hormonal? Does he just hate me? Was he a monster for 15 years and I just somehow never saw it? If he just wants out then why won't he discuss how to do it with 3 kids and a McMansion? That's going to require a lot of logistics. 

So men, if you have any insight at all, please share. At this point I'm not even trying to save the marriage, I'm just trying to figure out what the hell is going on and if there is a way to help the father of my children.

tl;dr around age 48/49 my husbands personality completely changed. Irritable, angry, drinking, ignoring me and just so so mean. Could it be hormones? Does anyone have any experience with this? Or did he just change and now my marriage just over?",1,1734662525.0,marriageadvice,18,1.0,False

I understand I have extreme, intense, anxiety driven emotional attachments at times. These are exhausting, hard to put up with, and need repair and reconciliation. I want to and have worked on those and continue to do so. But progress is not linear And i will falter and continue to do so. I’m extremely sorry for the pain, embarrassment, and emotional labor you’ve had to do as a result of them, and I hate knowing that I can be that way.   

It’s also hard though when you don’t recognize the way you have treated me early and often has led to a sharp increase in those feelings of instability I act on. Which I know isn’t the best phrasing, but I guess I mean that a lot of traumas were inflicted on our foundation by you early on: the ultimatum has had a huge impact on my security with respect to you hanging out with Alyse or Jake. The months that followed, where you kept me I. The dark on your level of communications with her, would randomly meet her for “coffee” and I had to trust you had not been physical with your ex of five years, when you went to a bar and kissed her multiple times and asked her to hate fuck you as I sat at home trying to be supportive thinking you were just talking things out, or when you went to dinner with a month before we moved to our current house. That, coupled with the odd feelings I’ve had regarding December 9th, which is why those messages on your Alexa perturbed me so much, have inflicted intense trust issues for me. That I’ve tried, extremely hard, to work through and past.   

And it has felt like you don’t want me to succeed at times. As soon as I was stating to feel secure, you would do something else:
- the new years demand for an open relationship 
- Getting drunk or intoxicated and comparing me to Alyse or noting what she would be okay with that I’m not
- Telling me, in front of my friends, that you were worried if you went to a club you would get to drunk and cheat on me
- Belittling or dismissing my very real and valid discomfort at times around certain situations. not attempts to control you but just expressing a need for reassurance, and displaying a complete apathy in doing so 
- The bikestop incident. Where you would proceed to make out with someone else, ask to suck his dick, and then gaslight me about it. Later that night, you would take a dick lubed with coconut oil and shove inside of me after I repeatedly told you I was not comfortable having sex that night. When I told you to stop, you then berated me and said that if I wasn’t going to put out, I should At least let you have a lover.
- You went to a club in Berlin and partied for 18 hours which isn’t bad but was hard, but would not FaceTime me while you were in Berlin despite saying you would, and even that night said you would FaceTime me but then went mia.  
    - Yes, the way I responded was also bad. Exhausting. Bpd, cptsd, one of the d’s. But I have felt so insecure in the relationship because of repeated betrayals of it and its security.   
- You regularly maintain communications and hang outs with someone you tried to force a relationship with for four years in Jake, and you insist he was not or is not an ex. Jake is also someone that urged you to break up with me for Alyse. And you did it.    
- You regularly, consistently, and often times it has felt like maliciously flirt with people I’ve expressed insecurity over in front of me. You say things like “if I was single I would fuck him again” or if I express insecurity you will go and do it to excess to the point of neglecting me at a birthday party I planned, organized, and threw for you.  When all I wanted was to express an insecurity.    
- While I was away in Vegas, your phone was off and when it turned on you were at Jake and Alyse’s house. Something I’ve expressed multiple times a discomfort over, and you did it while I was out of town and I am to take your word that Alyse was not there while her friend was in town.   
- You express  desire to go out clubbing with Jake until late in the morning.  
Those are a few of the relationships strifes that have contributed to my increasing sense of instability and insecurity, and I don’t know if you’re fully aware or not. I hope you’re not. These things don’t just go away, they need to be worked through and resolved. A lot of times I feel like they’re resolved by me just dropping the issue, and your resentment at me grows. And I feel like I can’t have needs, or wants, or feelings. The wedding is another really good example. You were invited to be a bridesmaid in a wedding, and I was not allowed to attend because I’m transgender. You attended, anyways,  and when I expressed a small ask to not see the slippers from the trip you said “it’s not a big deal,” just dismissing my feelings. And did, often about the wedding. Most of your friends even agreed that you should not go from what I heard.     

So while your feelings of being controlled and isolated are definitely valid, so are mine that I feel like I only ever express emotions to you, and I have tried so very hard not to isolate you at my own expense. You regularly do things like the wedding, Jake, Alyse, and others that I express discomfort with but never demand you don’t do, just tell you how much it will hurt me. If that is controlling, I don’t know how else I or anyone can be in a relationship and express our thoughts on things.    

As far as isolating, You go on trips with your friends, do things with them, and do all these things and I don’t demand you don’t do. I want to be invited, and Im hurt sometimes when I’m not and express that- sometimes not the best way but other times it’s been pretty standard.    

That said, I do jealousy and trust issues that I need to work on badly. When I hyperfixate on the worst possible outcome, I can become so focused that I will come up with reason after reason it’s so for you to dismiss. That’s unhealthy and I know that. And I’m sorry for the stress and pain and hardship that caused you.    

 I think your fear of intimacy leads you to behave and provoke increasing reactions from me and your past partners and you struggle to be accountable for their long term impacts on the safety and foundation of a relationship. I don’t think this,
Right now, is all about the things it’s about. I think a big part of it is an uncomfortability in feeling inadequate, in feeling like they let their partner down, and also a fear of the defense with your family and me in the same city.    

The fear of intimacy has also harmed our security and will in every relationship, because it’s something that changes how you interact with your partner whenever you feel commitment approaching. Moving in, dating, future plans- they are all things you want but also scare you. The further away they are the easier they are to fantasize about, which is why the future faking you did early in our relationship makes sense but it’s also been damaging to my security for it to
Pulled out from underneath me  the very second that you started missing Alyse last December. Which is what I took a mal adaptive thought pattern to the other night. Still my fault and I’m sorry.    

On being isolated, I am the most isolated of the two of us right now. I feel, and you’ve expressed can’t bring you around my friends, and part of that is my fault but also because of a lack of accountability for the way your actions, statements, and behaviors have been perceived without me even saying anything and a discomfort with feeling judged. This was true right after bikestop, when you immediately berated me for telling Rachel and ficca. I have lost two communities that were dear to me, snd I know you recognize that part of Seattle was the stress that we were both under dealing with the Alyse drama.   

The flip side is I have regularly had to interact with friends of yours I know have judgements about me, whether it be Brandon, Nick, Jake, Winslow, or Ari. I do it, and I try to be accountable for what you’ve said they’ve expressed.  You have expressed an extreme discomfort in doing that, even before going through my phone to read my texts with my friends regarding the wedding, us, and bikestop.    

But I do recognize that substance abuse and use has contributed to those feelings, and I’m sorry and will change. I recognize that you are slow to trust that, but I’m also slow to trust you on it. The best thing would probably be to just trust each other, and if we see it’s not coming to fruition this time, it’s an immediate end to the relationship.    

But off of that- I recognize that I have other toxic partners of behavior too. I do look over your shoulder on your phone. Early on in our relationship, you would  lay in front of me and show me almost every text you were sending intentionally. Randomly, one day, you started hiding it. I know now that’s when you started texting Alyse a little bit more, and my security dropped. I still shouldn’t do it to the level that I do it, and it reflects a deep insecurity I have that you deserve much better than someone
Like me. I have been and will
Work on it and know that one’s a lot better.   

Another one I have is wanting constant access to
You, which is both unrealistic and damaging to our relationship. I have and will continue to work on that.   

The Alexa thing, I am sorry about. I am
Sorry about the insistence. I was and am confused why you removed me from your house hold on Amazon, why you decided to not let me have access anymore even prior to that, and when I saw Alyse’s number I panicked. When I saw the date I panicked even more. Especially after you spoke about her nonstop at your birthday. But I’m still sorry. I’m sorry for degree of the insistence, for the accusation, for the inability to let it go.   

And I recognize the way that substance abuse has impacted us and our troubles this year. And you said it’s been hard the last three months. It has been. There have been three major hard things. Vegas, texts, and the wedding. There’s been hard things at every step of the way, in every relationship. And I am willing, ready, and able to fix the hard things with you. But I need you to recognize that fault isn’t on me and this being “my last straw” feels incredibly unfair right now.    

And I need you to recognize that your behaviors have at times edged onto or been full blown emotional abuse down to sexual abuse.    


In particular, the triangulation you have put me through our entire relationship has been a daunting task to not feel overly jealous. Whether that be the bar with Alyse, the dinner, the secret meet ups, and the reluctance to disclose that you’ve been communicating with her as recently as October 2024.   

Or Donzell, when you invited him to Pride- he’s straight right? And then your birthday when I expressed a discomfort and just wanted you to know, and then you decided to go fully “okay if you’re jealous watch this.” The constant push on my boundaries and comfort level and no attempt to empathize with me whatsoever for a moment in these situations or afterwards was incredibly difficult. Even Jake at times feels like a continuation of that triangulation behavior.   

You have regularly gotten so drunk that you have belittled me, compared me to Alyse as a lesser partner, and been cruel with your words. You also are just cruel with your words. You give everyone else around you this different person and version of yourself than is behind closed doors, where you call resort to belittling my intelligence, abilities, and attractiveness.   

You also are doing this at such an odd time, right after being accused, that it’s only increasing my perception that an affair has been ongoing with someone. You’ve been going to see “Jake” more, wearing lipstick to yoga and being more and more secretive about your plans. It’s fine, I knew you were a cheater with me and I knew you would do it on me. I have things to work on this relationship has taught me, I wonder if you’ll ever recognize your own flaws.",1,1734661994.0,letters,1,1.0,False

1hi9ny6,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN_Connect/comments/1hi9ny6/vpns_for_business_use_secure_remote_work_and/,VPNs for Business Use: Secure Remote Work and Protecting Company Data,"As businesses increasingly embrace remote work and cloud-based solutions, ensuring the security and privacy of company data has never been more important. A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is one of the most effective tools businesses can use to safeguard sensitive information and provide secure remote access to employees. Whether your team is working from home, on the go, or in a different office location, a VPN can help protect your company’s data from cyber threats, maintain privacy, and facilitate secure communication. In this post, we’ll explore how VPNs can enhance business security, enable secure remote work, and protect company data.

1. What is a VPN for Business Use?

A VPN for business use is a secure connection that allows employees to access a company’s internal network, applications, and data safely over the internet. A VPN works by encrypting the internet traffic between the user's device and the company's network, making it difficult for hackers or unauthorized users to access sensitive information. By using a VPN, businesses can ensure that their data remains confidential, even when employees are working remotely or using unsecured networks, such as public Wi-Fi.

2. Benefits of Using a VPN for Business

1. Secure Remote Access to Company Resources

Remote Work: With remote work becoming increasingly popular, a VPN enables employees to securely access the company’s internal network, file servers, and applications, no matter where they are located. It creates an encrypted tunnel between the employee’s device and the corporate network, ensuring that sensitive business data is protected from unauthorized access.

Cross-Border Connectivity: For businesses with teams in different countries, a VPN allows seamless and secure access to company resources, no matter where employees are working from. This is especially useful for companies operating in multiple locations or managing distributed teams.

2. Protect Company Data and Prevent Cyber Threats

Encryption: VPNs encrypt all internet traffic, ensuring that any data transmitted between remote employees and the company network remains private and protected. This is crucial for preventing data breaches and cyberattacks, such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where hackers try to intercept sensitive information.

Secure Communication: VPNs ensure that emails, documents, and other communications within the company remain secure, reducing the risk of interception by cybercriminals.

3. Safeguard Against Public Wi-Fi Vulnerabilities

Protection on Unsecure Networks: When employees use public Wi-Fi networks (such as those found in airports, hotels, or coffee shops), they are vulnerable to cybercriminals who can intercept unencrypted data. VPNs provide an extra layer of protection by encrypting internet traffic, making it difficult for hackers to steal login credentials, financial information, or sensitive company data.

Safe File Sharing and Collaboration: Using a VPN allows employees to share files and collaborate on projects securely without worrying about their data being intercepted on public networks.

4. Privacy and Anonymity for Employees

Masking IP Addresses: A VPN masks the employee’s real IP address and replaces it with the IP address of the VPN server, protecting their identity and location. This is important for maintaining privacy and preventing the tracking of employee activities.

No Logging of User Activities: Many businesses choose a VPN provider with a no-logs policy, which ensures that the VPN service does not track or store any information about the company’s internal communications or employee internet activity. This adds another layer of privacy and security for both the company and its employees.

5. Bypass Geo-Restrictions and Access Internal Resources

Access Blocked Content: Some businesses may need to access region-restricted resources, services, or websites. A VPN allows employees to bypass these geo-restrictions and access content as though they are in a different region, enabling smooth collaboration across borders.

Global Connectivity: A VPN enables employees working in different regions to have the same level of access to internal company resources, ensuring business continuity and productivity.

6. Centralized Control and Monitoring

Manage Employee Access: A business VPN allows IT administrators to set specific access rights for employees, ensuring that sensitive company data and systems are only accessible to authorized personnel. You can control who connects to the company’s network, which devices can connect, and the permissions granted to users.

Monitor Activity and Prevent Misuse: With the right VPN solution, businesses can monitor network traffic to identify any unusual activity that could indicate a security threat or misuse of company resources. Some VPN providers also offer detailed logging and reporting features for better control over remote access.

3. How VPNs Enable Secure Remote Work

With the rise of remote work, businesses must adopt new strategies to maintain productivity and security outside the office. VPNs are essential in facilitating secure remote work, providing the following key benefits:

1. Seamless Remote Access to Internal Resources

Employees can use their laptops, smartphones, or tablets to access company data and applications securely, even when working from home or while traveling. A VPN ensures that all connections to the company network are encrypted, preventing unauthorized access to confidential business information.

2. Reduced Risk of Cybersecurity Threats

Remote workers are often targeted by cybercriminals who exploit weaknesses in their home networks or unsecured Wi-Fi. With a VPN, remote workers are protected by the same level of security they would have if they were in the office, minimizing the risk of malware, phishing attacks, or data theft.

3. Enhanced Collaboration for Distributed Teams

In addition to securing communication, VPNs enable teams in different geographical locations to collaborate effectively. Team members can share files, access internal documents, and participate in video calls securely, without the risk of third-party interception.

4. Selecting the Best VPN for Your Business

When choosing a VPN for your business, it’s important to select a provider that meets your specific needs in terms of security, performance, and scalability. Here are some factors to consider:

1. Security Features

Look for a VPN that offers AES-256-bit encryption, DNS leak protection, and Kill Switch features to secure employee traffic.

A no-logs policy is also crucial to ensure that employee data and business communications are not tracked.

2. Scalability

Choose a VPN provider that can scale with your business as it grows, supporting multiple users and devices without sacrificing performance.

3. Performance and Speed

Opt for a VPN with fast speeds and low latency to ensure that remote work doesn’t experience slowdowns or interruptions.

4. Device Compatibility

Ensure that the VPN is compatible with the devices your employees use, including Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, and even mobile devices or routers.

5. Centralized Control and Monitoring

Choose a VPN provider that allows you to manage and monitor employee connections, restrict access to sensitive information, and track usage for security and compliance purposes.

Popular VPN providers for business use include NordVPN Teams, ExpressVPN for Business, CyberGhost for Teams, and Perimeter 81, which offer comprehensive features designed for secure remote work and protecting company data.

5. Conclusion

As businesses continue to embrace remote work and digital collaboration, ensuring the security and privacy of company data has become more critical than ever. A VPN is a vital tool for businesses to protect sensitive information, enable secure access to internal resources, and maintain privacy for remote employees. By using a VPN, businesses can offer secure remote access, protect against cyber threats, and enable seamless collaboration across distributed teams.

If your business has remote employees or operates in multiple locations, investing in a VPN solution can greatly enhance your security, safeguard company data, and support a productive, secure work environment.

At the time, the best thing for me was to move in with family and help both myself financially and them financially a little. 

I've decided I wanted to be on my own again and am in a good position now to do so. However, I am feeling so much guilt over this. I feel so bad. I know a lot of this I learned in childhood. I always had to please others, do as they say. Always felt so bad for putting myself first. I grew up and got married, and sadly, my marriage was a lot of the same. To include the abuse. But I was always called selfish for doing things while married, and that was literally anything. Putting music on my amazon Playlist, getting coffee (even though I'd ask if she wanted some), everything I did, I was deemed selfish. 


So I know, logically,  I'm not selfish for wanting to move out and be alone again. I suppose I feel bad because I would hope this family member would not be left struggling. 

I guess I wanted to get how I'm feeling out in the world, I will think about this forever and ever if I don't.
