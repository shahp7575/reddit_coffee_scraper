Hi everyone! Apologies for the blurry photos - I forgot to take better pictures when I picked up the keys today. I’m hitting a wall deciding on a theme/vibe I want to go with for my new place and hoping you all can help with some inspo - things like rug ideas, dining room table styles, aesthetic but functional wardrobes/storage, coffee tables, anything to make it cozy and homey. 
I will definitely be painting over the green walls with a warm white. I also moved the furniture around - the Bed is where the dining room table is in the photos, the couch is where the bed is and the dining room table is near the kitchen where the couch is in the photos. The coffee table and dining room table have to go. 
Any help is appreciated to get me started! ",1,1729651238.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False

Sophia has recently moved in with me and I was very excited about moving to the next step of our relationship. I know that seems early but I thought I was falling in love with her. However, lately, she’s been acting distant and working late more often. When I asked her about it, she said it was because one of her clients could only meet late. I accepted that explanation because, honestly, it made sense.  
  
But the more time went on, the more I noticed she was hiding her phone and pulling away from me. I started to get suspicious and, against my better judgment, I decided to follow her one night. I didn’t want to, but I felt like I needed to know what was going on.  
  
I ended up at a club where I saw her talking to a woman. My imagination ran wild. If she was cheating on me with a woman there's nothing that I can do because I'm a man it would be different if she was cheating on me with a man. I think it's easier to compare that way. It would be a little bit different I might feel different.  
  
I was mortified to find out that the woman was my sister Alexandria (22 Lesbian F), who Sophia had never met before. I was confused  angry and hurt. Why hadn't she talked to me about this. How did she meet my sister. I wanted to confront her but I felt so guilty for following her. so I stormed off home. I was not thinking rationally.  
  
When Sophia came back about 3 hours later, I thought I had calmed down enough so I confronted her.   
  
She explained that she had met this women on Bumble and they had gone out for coffee, which apparently progressed into something more. She said she had only kissed a girl once before, and that kiss ""awakened"" something in her. She said she had the urge to explore these feelings. She insisted that she had been suppressing her feelings for long that they forced there way out.  She said there was no possible way that she knew the woman was my sister. She told me that was sick and disgusting. She then went on to say that she was scared about her feelings. She vehemently denied knowing it was my sister She said she didn't know what to think about these feelings if they were real if they weren't. She even said that she felt ashamed of them. . I was at a loss for words.  
  
I was furious and so hurt. While holding back tears. I told her to leave our apartment and find somewhere else to stay for the time being. I told her that she would have to stay at a hotel or something. I just couldn't look at her; I felt betrayed and confused about everything. I told her ask she was walking out the door. she might have destroyed our relationship and messed up my family dynamics forever.  
  
Now I’m wondering if I overreacted. I talked to my family about this a they are saying that I am the AH for kicking her in the streets. I’m still dealing with so many emotions—anger, confusion, and heartbreak. AITA for asking her to leave? Should I have handled it differently? What do I do now?",2,1729651119.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

1ga01kt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ga01kt/aitah_took_back_a_birthday_cake_because_they/,AITAH took back a birthday cake because they didn’t eat it,"Coworker had a birthday. People have warned me about her. Said she uses me. 

For example: 

• never pays me for her Coffee/Food order when I pickup for the team

• never asks if I want a Coffee/Food if she goes (only gets for herself)

• wanted me to do her schoolwork/papers for online college 

• befriended me, called me all of the time, complimented, when I agreed to help her with schoolwork/papers 

• stopped calling me when I said I can’t help her with college work because I have my own stress, and suggested her to pay somebody 

Despite, I want to be amicable, so I brought a small cake, cute, under $15, to work for her birthday. 

Her birthday passes, she did not have the cake, she says she is leaving it in the work refrigerator for the next day.

Next day passes, she leaves it in there again. 

She knows it is there because she gets her food out of the refrigerator. 

So at the end of the second day, I took the cake home because it is going to expire, and discarded it. 

My gut instinct says she is insulting me by not accepting the gift because it is a small cake, and she expected me to bring a large, lavish cake. 

I also bought her a few sunflowers for the birthday. She took that home. 

I realize I was trying to people please and earn a work friend, and it’s one-sided. I also learned not to be nice at work because some people take it for granted. 

Today, when I was going to work, I was very close to text message if she wanted Coffee. But I didn’t because I felt in my gut that she never asks me if I want anything.

I walk into work, and there she is with her Coffee. Which confirmed exactly how I felt- she uses me.

AITAH for taking the cake home and throwing it out since it sat there untouched for two days?

If she asks me tomorrow where it went, I am going to say the truth that I threw it out because it was expiring and she left it sitting there. ",0,1729650928.0,AITAH,4,0.5,False

We used Lavazza Oro pregrounded coffee.

We made foam milk and added to both our coffee. I tasted his and said, ""Alright, not bad. Now try mine.""

1ga01cd,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1ga01cd/sixteen_tons/,Sixteen Tons,"“What’s got you in such a sour mood, Brandon? It’s payday!” my veteran colleague Vinson asked as the rusty freight elevator noisily rattled its way up towards the penthouse suite.

For the past year or two – I’m honestly not sure how long it’s been, actually – I’ve been under contract for an otherworldly masked Lord who calls himself Ignazio di Incognauta. He’s not a demon, exactly. He’s closer to Fae, I think, but I don’t fully understand what he is. I never sought him out. He came to me. I asked him how he even knew who I was, and he slapped me across the face for my insolence.

I still signed up though. That’s how desperate I was. He doesn’t waste his time offering deals to people who can say no.

He sends me and the rest of my crew out on what I can best describe as odd jobs. Half the time – hell, most of the time – I’m not even sure exactly what it is we’re doing. Most of the crew have been around longer than I have, and some of them aren’t human, but they all seem to have a better idea of what’s going on than me.

Our foreman Vothstag is technically the one in charge, but he’s not all there in the head; the top of his cranium’s been removed and a good chunk of his brain’s been scooped out. He mostly just barks guttural nonsense that none of us really understand, but somehow compels us to do what we’re supposed to, even when we don’t know what that is. He’s a hulking hunchback with an overgrown beard who usually wears an elk skull to cover up the hole in his head. If he was ever human, I don’t think he is now.

Vinson is our *de facto* leader, however, since he’s more or less a normal guy that we can relate to. Aside from Vothstag, he’s been working for Ignazio the longest. I won’t bother describing what he looks like, since the rest of us wear gas masks on duty. They’re partially to protect us from environmental and workplace hazards, partially to conceal our identities, but mainly to bring us more easily under Ignazio’s control.

That was why were all wearing our masks on the elevator, incidentally. We were on our way to see the big boss, and our contracts made it very clear we were never to remove our masks in his presence.  

“Come on, Vinson. You know meetings with Iggy never go well,” I replied bluntly.

“Oh, it’s just bluster. You know that. He’s got to put the fear of God into us,” Vinson claimed. “If he wasn’t actually satisfied with our performance, we wouldn’t still be here.”

“No, Brandon’s right. Iggy wouldn’t have called all ten of us in just to hand us our scrip and call us lazy arses,” Loewald chimed in.

“There’s nine of us, now,” Klaus reminded him grimly.

“Right, sorry. Hard to keep track some days,” Loewald admitted. “Regardless; something’s up, and the odds are pretty slim it will be something we like.”

I cringed as Vothstag shouted some of his garbled nonsense back towards Loewald.

“Yes, I know we’re not being paid to have fun, but –”

“We’re not being paid at all!” Klaus interrupted. “None of us are getting any real money until our contracts are up, and have any of you actually known anyone who made it to the end of their contract?” 

He recoiled as Vothstag spun around and began roaring at him, hot spittle flying out from beneath his mask of carved bone as he furiously waved his fist in his face.

“He’s right, Klaus. You’re being paranoid,” Vinson said in an eerily calm tone. “I’ve served out multiple contracts, and I’ve got the silver to prove it.”

He confidently reached into his pocket and held a troy-ounce coin of Seelie Silver between his fingers. Fish and Chips, the pair of three-foot-tall… *somethings* that work for us immediately crowded around him and began eyeing it greedily.

“That’s right boys, take a gander. That’s powerful magic right there, and you’ll get one of these for every moon you’ve worked at the end of your contracts,” he reminded us before quickly pocketing the coin away again. “Unless, of course, you do something to get your contract prematurely terminated; then you’ll have nothing to show for it but a fistful of expired scrip! So keep your heads down, mouths shut, and your eyes on the prize. You’ll have pockets jangling full of coins soon enough.”

As discreetly as I could, I slipped my hands into my pockets and rubbed my one Seelie coin for good luck. None of them knew I had it, because I didn’t want to explain how I got it, but that little bit of fortune it brought me had almost been enough to let me escape [once](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVespersBell/comments/yzlz7s/dont_shop_at_the_isomart_after_dark/).

If I could just muster up the skill to make the best use of my luck, it would be enough to get me out for good one day.

The freight elevator finally came to a stop, and the doors creaked open to reveal the spacious and sumptuous penthouse of our employer. Portraits, animal heads, shields, weapons, and most of all masquerade masks covered nearly every square inch of the walls. Amidst the suits of armour and porcelain vases, there were dozens of priceless ornaments strewn throughout the room. They were incredibly tempting to steal, which was their whole point. Stealing from the boss was a violation of your contract, and you did not want to break your contract.  

The wide windows on the far wall offered a panoramic view of our decaying company town, nestled in a valley between sharp crimson mountains beneath a xanthous sky twinkling with a thousand black stars. You may have heard of such a place before, it has many names, but I will speak none of them here. 

Ignazio was sitting on a reclining couch in front of the fireplace, some paperwork left out on the coffee table and a featureless mask like a silver spiderweb clutched in his hand. Ignazio himself always wore the top half of a golden Oni mask, which in and of itself wasn’t unusual for our company, but the odd thing was that several portraits in the penthouse showed that it had once been a full mask.

I’ve always wondered what happened to the bottom half.  

Aside from that, Ignazio wasn’t too unusual looking. He was tall, skinny, and swarthy with a pronounced chin, tousled dark brown hair and always dressed in doublets of silk and velvet like he was performing Shakespeare or something.

Vothstag went into the room first, with Vinson almost, but not quite, at his side. Fish and Chips scamped after them, followed by Loewald, Klaus, and myself.

The last two members of our crew are called Hamm and Gristle, and they’re the two I know the least about. They keep to themselves, and I don’t think I’ve ever even seen them with their masks off. I have seen them without gloves on though, and both of their hands are white with pink-tinged fingers. I have no idea what that means, but for some reason, I always found it oddly unsettling.

The only thing I know for sure about them is that they’re the only survivors of another crew that tried to run out on their contract, and I know better than to ask for details about that.

“Gentlemen, Gentlemen, right on time,” Ignazio greeted us as he waved us over. He positioned himself on his couch to make it impossible for any of us to sit beside him, and none of us dared to take a seat at any of the clawfooted armchairs that were meant for guests with much higher stations in life. “I’ve got this moon’s scrip books all stamped and approved. You’ll notice they’re a bit light, seeing as how you were slightly behind quota on this assignment.”

None of us objected, and none of us were particularly surprised. I was grateful that the mask hid my expression, and I’m sure I wasn’t the only one. I still had to make an effort to mind my body language though. Being so accustomed to his employees and compatriots wearing masks, Ignazio was quite astute to body language.

Vinson accepted the stack of nine booklets and nodded gratefully.

“We appreciate your leniency, my lord, and look forward to earning back our privileges on our next assignment,” he said.

“I was hoping you’d say that,” Ignazio grinned as he took a sip from his crystal chalice. He set it down on the coffee table and picked up a dossier. “Halloween is fast approaching, and that means we need costumes and candy. Costumes we have in abundance, obviously, but candy’s one vice I don’t usually keep well stocked.”

“So we’re actually stealing candy from babies on our next job?” Klaus asked.

“Nothing so quotidian,” Ignazio sneered. “Remind me; have any of you met Icky before?”

The name meant nothing to me, but I glanced from side to side to see if anyone else reacted to it. I could have sworn I saw Hamm and Gristle perk their heads up slightly.

“She’s that Clown woman, right? The one in charge of that god-awful circus?” Vinson asked.

“I beg your pardon? It’s an enchanted Circus that travels the worlds and offers sanctuary to paranormal vagabonds in need,” Ignazio claimed half-heartedly. “And I might be able to pawn a few of you off on them if it comes to that, so be careful you don’t fall any further behind on your quotas. But you’re right; she is a Clown, with a capital C, and Clowns love candy. She’ll be attending my All Hallows’ Ball this year, and I don’t want her to feel excluded, so we’ll need some real top-shelf candy on offer.”

“Ah… we’re still waiting for the other shoe to drop here, boss,” Vinson confessed as most of us shared nervous glances with one another. “You want us to get candy? Fancy candy? I… I don’t get it. What’s the catch?”   

“Oh god, we’re not taking it from babies: we’re serving the babies with it!” Loewald balked in horror.

“No, but thank you for that highball to make the actual assignment seem more reasonable,” Ignazio said. “No, I’m sending you all down to the Taproots of the World Tree to collect some of the crystalized sap there.”

“The… The Taproots of the World Tree?” Vinson repeated softly. “The physical manifestation of the metaphysical network that binds all the worlds and planes of Creation, gnawed at by the Naught Things trying to break their way into reality? You’re sending us down there… for sweets?”

“Icky swears that Yggdrasil syrup pairs beautifully with French Toast,” he replied blithely. “This is an especially dangerous assignment, so I want you all to read that dossier in full. Emrys has been charting and forging new pathways through the planes from his spire in Adderwood, so thanks to him your trip down at least will be relatively easy.”

“Just… just there and back, right?” Vinson asked desperately, his voice wavering. “Just a handful of the stuff to wow Icky, and we’re done, right?”

A sadistic smirk slowly spread across Ignazio’s face before he told us how much crystalized sap we would need to retrieve.

\*\*\*

“You mine sixteen tons, what do you get? Another day older, and deeper in debt,” Loebald sang as he chipped away at the pulsing amber crystal emerging from the leviathan root.

The World Tree was cosmically colossal, though it’s meaningless to describe its size since I can only describe the parts of it that exist in three dimensions. The twin trunks of the tree snaked around each other like a double helix, each alight with an ever-shifting astral aura that perpetually waxed and waned in synchronicity with its twin. From its crown sprung a seemingly infinite mass of fractally dividing branches, shimmering with countless spherical ‘leaves’ which I knew to be individual universes. The base of the tree spawned an equally infinite mass of sprawling taproots, anchoring it in place and drawing precious sustenance from the edges of reality.  

As dangerous as it was to be there, it was nonetheless a sublime experience. You think that looking upon all of existence like that would fill you with Lovecraftian madness at your own insignificance, but it was far more transcendental than that. On some fundamental level, I recognized that tree. It was Yggdrasil. It was the Biblical tree of Good and Evil. It was the Two Trees of Valinor. That tree was meant to be there, and so was everything inside of it. Sure, it was functionally infinite and everything in it was finite, but the tree wasn’t merely massive; it was intricate. In the grand scheme of things, nothing inside of it was superfluous. Everything, no matter its scale, was part of the ultimate design of the tree. You and I may not be any more important than anyone or anything else, but if we weren’t important, we wouldn’t be here.

I’m not entirely sure if any of my coworkers felt the same way though.

“Saint Peter don’t you call me, ’cause I can’t go,” Loebald continued to sing, only to be interrupted by Vothstag’s irate howling, his eyes burning like coals as he dared him to finish the chorus.

Loebald bowed his head contritely as he awkwardly cleared his throat. When Vothstag was satisfied he had been cowed into silence, he turned around to resume his work.

“’Cause I owe my soul to the company store,” I finished for him, not too loudly, but loud enough that everyone heard me.

Vothstag immediately came charging at me, roaring in fury, but I didn’t flinch. I just let him chew me out for about a minute until I heard something that I was pretty sure was a question.

“That’s ridiculous. You’re making more noise than either of us,” I countered. “And wasting more time. Now if you don’t mind, I’ve got work to do.”

Vothstag sneered at me, but since I had resumed my task, his job as taskmaster was complete, and he left to attend to other matters.

“What the hell are you doing, pushing your luck like that, Brandon?” Vinson whispered.

“He was out of line. Even chain gangs are allowed to sing,” I explained. “Besides, I’m right, aren’t I? If we attract any unwanted attention, it will be because of him.”

“This isn’t the place to cause trouble!” he hissed. “Fill the carts as fast as you can so we can get out of here!”

When we arrived at the Taproots, we saw that we weren’t the first beings to try to mine this deposit of sap. Someone, likely some clan of Unseelie Fae, had established a fairly complex operation with rails and hand carts. As convenient as this was for us, it did of course pose the uncomfortable question of why the site had been completely abandoned when it was obviously far from depleted.

Me, Vinson, Loebald, and Klaus were chipping away at the crystal sap, tossing what we could into a nearby trolley cart. When it was full, Hamm and Gristle would haul it off so that Fish and Chips could scoop it into twenty-kilogram bags, which Hamm and Gristle would then stack and secure onto skids.

And as always, Vothstag supervised.

“Sixteen bleedin’ tons of this bilge,” Vinson muttered as he took a swing at it with his pickaxe. “And he’s got the nerve to tell us it’s just an appetizer for a party guest. What do you suppose they’re going to do with it all.”

“Refine it into proper syrup, I imagine,” Loewald replied. “Make it into sweets and sodas, or just drizzle some of it straight onto flapjacks. Either way, they’ll make a killing. Sixteen tons will probably sell for millions.”

“Why though? Is it just exotic sugar?” I asked.

“What do you think?” Loewald asked rhetorically, gesturing at the source. “For reality benders, anything from the edges of reality is potent stuff. They put a lump of this in their morning coffee, and the Veil will seem as weak to them as it is here. There’s no telling what havoc they’ll get up to, so you better hope we’re not around to see.”

“Now you’re just being ridiculous. Clowns don’t drink coffee,” Vinson joked.

I was about to ask him how he would know, when Vothstag put his hand on my shoulder and spun me around. Hamm and Gristle had returned with the empty cart, but only Gristle was getting ready to pull the full one. Vothstag spewed some of his usual gibberish, gesturing at me and then towards Hamm’s empty space at the cart.

“Because I sang one line? Seriously?” I asked. I was about to throw Loewald under the bus for singing in the first place, but Vothstag was already roaring incomprehensibly. “Alright, alright. I’ll pull the damn cart.”

I handed my pickaxe over to Hamm, who instantly began swinging at the sap with manic enthusiasm. Gristle gave me a slight nod of condolence before Vothstag yoked me up to the cart like an ox and then sent us on our way with an angry shout.

“If you don’t mind me asking, how come Hamm deserves a break and you don’t?” I asked Gristle as we made our way down the track, the dinging of our colleague’s pickaxes slowly fading into the background.

Gristle looked over his shoulder to confirm the Vothstag was well out of earshot, and then turned his head towards mine.

“Vinson’s wrong, you know,” he said in a soft, conspiratorial whisper.

“Ah… I’m story?” I asked.

“About Clowns and coffee,” he clarified. “Icky drinks coffee. I’ve seen her do it. She takes it with double cream and sugar to keep it Clown Kosher, of course. She’s a little too classy to indulge in stereotypical candy binges, but she’s still got a sweet tooth like the rest of us.”

“…Us?” I asked uneasily.

Gristle nodded, lifting up his gas mask by the filter and revealing his face to me for the first time. His poreless skin was a lustrous white, but his lips, nose, and the space around his eyes were all pitch black, and the eyes themselves sparkled with the light of a thousand dying stars. His mouth was spread into an unnaturally wide smile, revealing that his teeth were not only perfect but shiny to the point that I could see myself in them.

And I looked terrified.

“Loewald was right though, about what this stuff will do to us,” he went on. “Once everything’s fully loaded, Hamm and I are going to take a mouthful each and then take the whole haul for ourselves. We’ll stash some of it away somewhere safe, then use the rest to buy our way back into the Circus. The only problem is getting there. That’s where you come in.”

“What are you on about? How can I possibly help you get back to your Circus?” I asked.

“With that Seelie coin you got in your pocket,” he said, lowering his voice so that I only barely heard him. “These carts weren’t meant to be powered manually, you know. They run on Faerie magic, and that coin’s got enough that we can drive all sixteen tons of our loot to anywhere in the worlds we want.”

I briefly considered denying that I even had the coin, but if he was determined, he could find and take it easily enough, so there really wasn’t any point.

“Ignoring for the moment how you even know I have that, why not ask Vinson?” I suggested. “He’s got way more Seelie Silver than I do.”

“He doesn’t want out. You do,” Gristle responded. “You tried to escape once, and I know you’re just itching for a chance to try again.”

“But… Ignazio knows what you are, doesn’t he? He wouldn’t have let you around the sap if he wasn’t prepared for you to try to take some,” I said.

“He doesn’t know Hamm and I can take our masks off without his say-so,” Gristle explained. “We’ve been living off meagre rations of powdered milk to keep us in line, but we were able to get a hold of a bottle of the fresh stuff and chugged it before we came here. Ignazio and Vothstag have no power over us right now.”

“… I’m sorry, milk?” I asked confused.

“Not important at the moment. Are you in or not?” he asked.

I considered his proposition for a moment, deciding on one final question before answering.    

“Why not just take the coin from me?”

“Because I’m a nice guy,” he said with a sickeningly wide grin. “And… stealing Seelie Silver tends not to end well. I don’t need an answer now. The load’s not full yet. Think about it, and when the time comes, do whatever you’ve got to do.”

He pulled his mask back down, and we finished hauling the cart over to Fish and Chips in silence.

He wasn’t wrong about me wanting to escape, but my plan had always been to quietly sneak off and be long gone before anyone noticed. A fight between Vothstag and a pair of superpowered Clowns followed by a daring getaway on an Unseelie mining cart was a bit riskier than anything I had envisioned. But at the same time, this was an unprecedented opportunity that would likely never come again.  From the Taproots of the World Tree, I could go literally anywhere, and never have to worry about Ignazio or his minions tracking me down.

All it would cost me was the single coin I had to my name.

I hauled the cart with Gristle for the rest of the shift. Eventually, we had a train of sixteen pallets, each loaded with fifty twenty-kilogram sacks of crystalized sap.

“That’s it then. Order’s full,” Vinson declared as he walked the length of the train, testing the chains to make sure the cargo was fully secured. “All of you hop in the front and let’s get the hell out of here.”

Vothstag roared in disagreement, standing between us and the cart and making a vaguely groping gesture.

“Right, right. Contraband check,” Vinson nodded with a weary sigh as he outstretched his arms. “Nothing too invasive now, you hear? If this stuff was inside of us, you’d already know it.”

Vothstag didn’t acknowledge his comment, but proceeded to pat him down and empty his pockets.

Hamm and Gristle each gave me a knowing look. If I did nothing, Vothstag would find my coin and it would all be over for me anyway. I nodded my assent, and braced myself for the worse.

With a single swift motion, Hamm and Gristle each pulled their masks off, and the visages of the two monstrous Clowns were enough to throw all of us into immediate pandemonium. Hamm’s hair, eyes, lips and nose were all a fiery red, and I saw now that the tips of their ears had a pink tinge, just like their fingers. The instant their masks were off, they wasted no time shovelling a handful of crystal sap into their mouths.

Vothstag howled and charged straight at them, and everyone else scattered as quickly as they could to avoid being bulldozed by the massive deer man. Hamm and Gristle stood their ground, each of them grabbing ahold of one of his antlers. Despite his size and speed, Vothstag was brought to a dead stop.

He snorted and bellowed as he tried to force himself forward, but he was completely unable to overpower the two Clowns. Hamm and Gristle exchanged sinister smiles and began to spin Vothstag around and around. Within seconds his feet were off the ground, and with each rotation, he gained more and more momentum until his attackers finally let go of his antlers and sent him flying into the distance.

“The rest of you, stay out of our way!” Gristle shouted as he marched towards the front cart, grabbing me by the scruff of my jacket and pulling me along with him.

“Wait, why? Why can’t they come? Why can’t we all go?” I protested.

“We don’t know what half these freaks are and we don’t trust them,” he said as he tossed me onto the cart. “Now drive. Go straight until I say otherwise.”

I looked out at my confused and frightened companions, and took a bit of solace in the fact that they weren’t entirely certain if I had betrayed them or if I was just being kidnapped. I hesitated for a moment, but Hamm’s sharp talons digging into my shoulder were enough to press me into action.

With my coin of Seelie Silver clutched in my right palm, I grabbed a firm hold of the driving shaft and pushed the train forward. It accelerated at a remarkable pace, and before I knew it, we were speeding away from our work site and towards freedom.

“It’s working. It’s actually working,” Gristle laughed in relief.

“Even Vothstag can’t run this fast!” Hamm declared triumphantly. “The whole haul is ours! We’re rich! We’re free!”

I wanted to celebrate with them. I really did. But deep down inside I knew we weren’t out of the woods yet.

“You guys read that dossier Iggy gave us, right?” I asked. “The Naught Things that gnaw the Taproots are attracted to ontological anchors – anything that’s more real than its surroundings. If you guys are reality benders, and you just ate a massive power-up, doesn’t that make you the realest things here?”

“Isn’t that cute? He thinks he knows more about ontodynamics than us because he read a dossier,” Hamm scoffed.

“This isn’t our first time on the fringes of the unreal, boy!” Gristle replied. “You just drive this train, and let us worry about –”

Without warning, the Taproot split open ahead of us into a fuming, festering chasm. The ground quake was enough to completely derail the train, and I ducked and rolled while I had the chance.

When I came out of the roll, I looked up to see a titanic, disfigured, and disembodied head rising out of the chasm. The size and proportions of the entity fluctuated wildly, as if I was only looking at the three-dimensional facets of it like the World Tree itself. It was encrusted with some kind of dark barnacles, and anything that wasn’t its face was covered in thousands of squirming and feathery tentacles of every conceivable length. It had no nose, but several mouths which chanted backwards-sounding words in synchronicity with each other, dropping rotting black teeth every time they opened and closed. 

There were six randomly spaced and variously sized eyeballs darting around independently of each other, each glowing with a sickly yellow light. I was paralyzed in fear, terrified that the Naught Thing would see me, but all six of its eyes soon locked onto Hamm and Gristle.

As it slowly ascended upwards like a hot air balloon, a pair of flickering tongues shot out of two of its mouths with predatory intent. The Clowns were scooped up like flies, screaming as they were whisked back into the Naught Thing’s cavernous maws. I don’t know much about Clowns or what they’re capable of, only that Hamm and Gristle never got a chance to test their mettle against this behemoth. A few chomps of its black teeth, and it was all over.

I sat there in silence, watching as the Naught Thing continued to drift away, never daring to assume that it had forgotten about me.

“Brandon!” I heard a voice call from the distance.

I was finally able to pull my eyes off the Naught Thing, and when I looked down the track, I saw the rest of my crew hurrying towards me.

Which included a very angry Vothstag.

Grabbing me by the jacket and lifting me off the ground, he roared furiously in my face, demanding answers.

“Easy, Vothstag, easy!” Vinson insisted. “They just grabbed the kid. It wasn’t his idea.”

Vothstag growled skeptically, eyeing the toppled train beside us. He knew it could have only been driven like that by Seelie magic, and I still had my lucky coin clutched tightly in my right hand.

“…Hamm must have picked my pocket when he was working alongside us,” Vinson suggested.

I knew he didn’t really think that. He knew exactly how many coins he had, and he knew he wasn’t missing any. I don’t know why he covered for me, but I owe him big.

“Serves him right, too. Bloody idiot,” he said with a sad shake of his head as he surveyed the wreckage. “Let this be a lesson for all of you if you ever think about stealing my Seelie Silver! That’s right, Fish and Chips, I’m looking at you!”

Vothstag howled again, clearly unconvinced.

“They took me as a driver so that they could stay focused on defending the train!” I claimed. “If I hadn’t jumped when I did, they may have stood a chance against that giant floating head! I saved our haul!”

Vothstag snorted in contempt, but set me back on my feet. I don’t think he believed me, really, but he knew that Ignazio wouldn’t hold him blameless in this little debacle either, so it was in all of our best interests not to cast aspersions on one another’s stories.

“Listen up, everybody! We’re two men down and we’ve got to get this rig back on the track before some other unspeakable abomination comes along, so get moving!” Vinson ordered.

For once, Vothstag was doing most of the work, using his might to set the carts back on the tracks, while the rest of us just picked up any sacks of sap that had come loose.

“What a bloody joke,” Loewald grumbled as he threw a sack onto a cart. “Down from nine to seven, any of us could still die at any minute, and for what? We mined sixteen tons, and what do we get?”

“Another day older,” I agreed, throwing another sack next to his. “But some days, that’s enough.”",1,1729650906.0,DarkTales,0,1.0,False

1g9zzpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1g9zzpp/struggling_with_sleep/,Struggling with sleep,"I don't know if this is an ADHD thing or not but I am really struggling to sleep at the moment and it really beginning to affect me mentally and physically.

I've tried to contact the GP but it isn't considered an emergency so I have to wait 2 weeks for a phone call appointment. 

For the last 5 weeks my sleep has been wildly inconsistent which is not very common to me. Normally I have a good routine where I go to sleep at 10pm, sleep solidly until 5:30am when I wake up.
But at the moment I am struggling to sleep even when I'm tired, my mind seems to just be racing and half the time I couldn't even tell you what I'm thinking about it's just lots of random things. When I do then full asleep it hasn't been a deep sleep, I'm waking up regularly throughout the night and never feel like I'm asleep fully, more like half asleep and partially aware that I'm not asleep the whole time.
I'm also consistently waking up way earlier than needed, around 2am most mornings and being wide awake and unable to sleep. 

Sleeping never used to be an issue for me and I used to love going to bed and suddenly now I can't sleep at all and the thought stresses me out. I feel restless in bed, constantly moving around, my legs feel achey and restless and nothing feels comfortable.

I do all the generic advice, I walk a lot daily (around 17k steps a day), I don't smoke, drink alcohol or coffee, apart from the odd day my diet is consistent and healthy, I always have same bed time and wake up time, my room is pitch black, I use a sound machine for white noise as it helps me (have tried without recently too).

My job (teaching) I know can be stereotypically stressful, but this year I've got great classes and no real problems at all. I'm not overworked and never really stress about that. The lack of sleep however is making it very difficult to effectively do my job.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated as I really don't know what else I can do at this point.",1,1729650758.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

1g9zwjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1g9zwjp/sixteen_tons/,Sixteen Tons,"“What’s got you in such a sour mood, Brandon? It’s payday!” my veteran colleague Vinson asked as the rusty freight elevator noisily rattled its way up towards the penthouse suite.

For the past year or two – I’m honestly not sure how long it’s been, actually – I’ve been under contract for an otherworldly masked Lord who calls himself Ignazio di Incognauta. He’s not a demon, exactly. He’s closer to Fae, I think, but I don’t fully understand what he is. I never sought him out. He came to me. I asked him how he even knew who I was, and he slapped me across the face for my insolence.

I still signed up though. That’s how desperate I was. He doesn’t waste his time offering deals to people who can say no.

He sends me and the rest of my crew out on what I can best describe as odd jobs. Half the time – hell, most of the time – I’m not even sure exactly what it is we’re doing. Most of the crew have been around longer than I have, and some of them aren’t human, but they all seem to have a better idea of what’s going on than me.

Our foreman Vothstag is technically the one in charge, but he’s not all there in the head; the top of his cranium’s been removed and a good chunk of his brain’s been scooped out. He mostly just barks guttural nonsense that none of us really understand, but somehow compels us to do what we’re supposed to, even when we don’t know what that is. He’s a hulking hunchback with an overgrown beard who usually wears an elk skull to cover up the hole in his head. If he was ever human, I don’t think he is now.

Vinson is our *de facto* leader, however, since he’s more or less a normal guy that we can relate to. Aside from Vothstag, he’s been working for Ignazio the longest. I won’t bother describing what he looks like, since the rest of us wear gas masks on duty. They’re partially to protect us from environmental and workplace hazards, partially to conceal our identities, but mainly to bring us more easily under Ignazio’s control.

That was why were all wearing our masks on the elevator, incidentally. We were on our way to see the big boss, and our contracts made it very clear we were never to remove our masks in his presence.  

“Come on, Vinson. You know meetings with Iggy never go well,” I replied bluntly.

“Oh, it’s just bluster. You know that. He’s got to put the fear of God into us,” Vinson claimed. “If he wasn’t actually satisfied with our performance, we wouldn’t still be here.”

“No, Brandon’s right. Iggy wouldn’t have called all ten of us in just to hand us our scrip and call us lazy arses,” Loewald chimed in.

“There’s nine of us, now,” Klaus reminded him grimly.

“Right, sorry. Hard to keep track some days,” Loewald admitted. “Regardless; something’s up, and the odds are pretty slim it will be something we like.”

I cringed as Vothstag shouted some of his garbled nonsense back towards Loewald.

“Yes, I know we’re not being paid to have fun, but –”

“We’re not being paid at all!” Klaus interrupted. “None of us are getting any real money until our contracts are up, and have any of you actually known anyone who made it to the end of their contract?” 

He recoiled as Vothstag spun around and began roaring at him, hot spittle flying out from beneath his mask of carved bone as he furiously waved his fist in his face.

“He’s right, Klaus. You’re being paranoid,” Vinson said in an eerily calm tone. “I’ve served out multiple contracts, and I’ve got the silver to prove it.”

He confidently reached into his pocket and held a troy-ounce coin of Seelie Silver between his fingers. Fish and Chips, the pair of three-foot-tall… *somethings* that work for us immediately crowded around him and began eyeing it greedily.

“That’s right boys, take a gander. That’s powerful magic right there, and you’ll get one of these for every moon you’ve worked at the end of your contracts,” he reminded us before quickly pocketing the coin away again. “Unless, of course, you do something to get your contract prematurely terminated; then you’ll have nothing to show for it but a fistful of expired scrip! So keep your heads down, mouths shut, and your eyes on the prize. You’ll have pockets jangling full of coins soon enough.”

As discreetly as I could, I slipped my hands into my pockets and rubbed my one Seelie coin for good luck. None of them knew I had it, because I didn’t want to explain how I got it, but that little bit of fortune it brought me had almost been enough to let me escape [once](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVespersBell/comments/yzlz7s/dont_shop_at_the_isomart_after_dark/).

If I could just muster up the skill to make the best use of my luck, it would be enough to get me out for good one day.

The freight elevator finally came to a stop, and the doors creaked open to reveal the spacious and sumptuous penthouse of our employer. Portraits, animal heads, shields, weapons, and most of all masquerade masks covered nearly every square inch of the walls. Amidst the suits of armour and porcelain vases, there were dozens of priceless ornaments strewn throughout the room. They were incredibly tempting to steal, which was their whole point. Stealing from the boss was a violation of your contract, and you did not want to break your contract.  

The wide windows on the far wall offered a panoramic view of our decaying company town, nestled in a valley between sharp crimson mountains beneath a xanthous sky twinkling with a thousand black stars. You may have heard of such a place before, it has many names, but I will speak none of them here. 

Ignazio was sitting on a reclining couch in front of the fireplace, some paperwork left out on the coffee table and a featureless mask like a silver spiderweb clutched in his hand. Ignazio himself always wore the top half of a golden Oni mask, which in and of itself wasn’t unusual for our company, but the odd thing was that several portraits in the penthouse showed that it had once been a full mask.

I’ve always wondered what happened to the bottom half.  

Aside from that, Ignazio wasn’t too unusual looking. He was tall, skinny, and swarthy with a pronounced chin, tousled dark brown hair and always dressed in doublets of silk and velvet like he was performing Shakespeare or something.

Vothstag went into the room first, with Vinson almost, but not quite, at his side. Fish and Chips scamped after them, followed by Loewald, Klaus, and myself.

The last two members of our crew are called Hamm and Gristle, and they’re the two I know the least about. They keep to themselves, and I don’t think I’ve ever even seen them with their masks off. I have seen them without gloves on though, and both of their hands are white with pink-tinged fingers. I have no idea what that means, but for some reason, I always found it oddly unsettling.

The only thing I know for sure about them is that they’re the only survivors of another crew that tried to run out on their contract, and I know better than to ask for details about that.

“Gentlemen, Gentlemen, right on time,” Ignazio greeted us as he waved us over. He positioned himself on his couch to make it impossible for any of us to sit beside him, and none of us dared to take a seat at any of the clawfooted armchairs that were meant for guests with much higher stations in life. “I’ve got this moon’s scrip books all stamped and approved. You’ll notice they’re a bit light, seeing as how you were slightly behind quota on this assignment.”

None of us objected, and none of us were particularly surprised. I was grateful that the mask hid my expression, and I’m sure I wasn’t the only one. I still had to make an effort to mind my body language though. Being so accustomed to his employees and compatriots wearing masks, Ignazio was quite astute to body language.

Vinson accepted the stack of nine booklets and nodded gratefully.

“We appreciate your leniency, my lord, and look forward to earning back our privileges on our next assignment,” he said.

“I was hoping you’d say that,” Ignazio grinned as he took a sip from his crystal chalice. He set it down on the coffee table and picked up a dossier. “Halloween is fast approaching, and that means we need costumes and candy. Costumes we have in abundance, obviously, but candy’s one vice I don’t usually keep well stocked.”

“So we’re actually stealing candy from babies on our next job?” Klaus asked.

“Nothing so quotidian,” Ignazio sneered. “Remind me; have any of you met Icky before?”

The name meant nothing to me, but I glanced from side to side to see if anyone else reacted to it. I could have sworn I saw Hamm and Gristle perk their heads up slightly.

“She’s that Clown woman, right? The one in charge of that god-awful circus?” Vinson asked.

“I beg your pardon? It’s an enchanted Circus that travels the worlds and offers sanctuary to paranormal vagabonds in need,” Ignazio claimed half-heartedly. “And I might be able to pawn a few of you off on them if it comes to that, so be careful you don’t fall any further behind on your quotas. But you’re right; she is a Clown, with a capital C, and Clowns love candy. She’ll be attending my All Hallows’ Ball this year, and I don’t want her to feel excluded, so we’ll need some real top-shelf candy on offer.”

“Ah… we’re still waiting for the other shoe to drop here, boss,” Vinson confessed as most of us shared nervous glances with one another. “You want us to get candy? Fancy candy? I… I don’t get it. What’s the catch?”   

“Oh god, we’re not taking it from babies: we’re serving the babies with it!” Loewald balked in horror.

“No, but thank you for that highball to make the actual assignment seem more reasonable,” Ignazio said. “No, I’m sending you all down to the Taproots of the World Tree to collect some of the crystalized sap there.”

“The… The Taproots of the World Tree?” Vinson repeated softly. “The physical manifestation of the metaphysical network that binds all the worlds and planes of Creation, gnawed at by the Naught Things trying to break their way into reality? You’re sending us down there… for sweets?”

“Icky swears that Yggdrasil syrup pairs beautifully with French Toast,” he replied blithely. “This is an especially dangerous assignment, so I want you all to read that dossier in full. Emrys has been charting and forging new pathways through the planes from his spire in Adderwood, so thanks to him your trip down at least will be relatively easy.”

“Just… just there and back, right?” Vinson asked desperately, his voice wavering. “Just a handful of the stuff to wow Icky, and we’re done, right?”

A sadistic smirk slowly spread across Ignazio’s face before he told us how much crystalized sap we would need to retrieve.

\*\*\*

“You mine sixteen tons, what do you get? Another day older, and deeper in debt,” Loebald sang as he chipped away at the pulsing amber crystal emerging from the leviathan root.

The World Tree was cosmically colossal, though it’s meaningless to describe its size since I can only describe the parts of it that exist in three dimensions. The twin trunks of the tree snaked around each other like a double helix, each alight with an ever-shifting astral aura that perpetually waxed and waned in synchronicity with its twin. From its crown sprung a seemingly infinite mass of fractally dividing branches, shimmering with countless spherical ‘leaves’ which I knew to be individual universes. The base of the tree spawned an equally infinite mass of sprawling taproots, anchoring it in place and drawing precious sustenance from the edges of reality.  

As dangerous as it was to be there, it was nonetheless a sublime experience. You think that looking upon all of existence like that would fill you with Lovecraftian madness at your own insignificance, but it was far more transcendental than that. On some fundamental level, I recognized that tree. It was Yggdrasil. It was the Biblical tree of Good and Evil. It was the Two Trees of Valinor. That tree was meant to be there, and so was everything inside of it. Sure, it was functionally infinite and everything in it was finite, but the tree wasn’t merely massive; it was intricate. In the grand scheme of things, nothing inside of it was superfluous. Everything, no matter its scale, was part of the ultimate design of the tree. You and I may not be any more important than anyone or anything else, but if we weren’t important, we wouldn’t be here.

I’m not entirely sure if any of my coworkers felt the same way though.

“Saint Peter don’t you call me, ’cause I can’t go,” Loebald continued to sing, only to be interrupted by Vothstag’s irate howling, his eyes burning like coals as he dared him to finish the chorus.

Loebald bowed his head contritely as he awkwardly cleared his throat. When Vothstag was satisfied he had been cowed into silence, he turned around to resume his work.

“’Cause I owe my soul to the company store,” I finished for him, not too loudly, but loud enough that everyone heard me.

Vothstag immediately came charging at me, roaring in fury, but I didn’t flinch. I just let him chew me out for about a minute until I heard something that I was pretty sure was a question.

“That’s ridiculous. You’re making more noise than either of us,” I countered. “And wasting more time. Now if you don’t mind, I’ve got work to do.”

Vothstag sneered at me, but since I had resumed my task, his job as taskmaster was complete, and he left to attend to other matters.

“What the hell are you doing, pushing your luck like that, Brandon?” Vinson whispered.

“He was out of line. Even chain gangs are allowed to sing,” I explained. “Besides, I’m right, aren’t I? If we attract any unwanted attention, it will be because of him.”

“This isn’t the place to cause trouble!” he hissed. “Fill the carts as fast as you can so we can get out of here!”

When we arrived at the Taproots, we saw that we weren’t the first beings to try to mine this deposit of sap. Someone, likely some clan of Unseelie Fae, had established a fairly complex operation with rails and hand carts. As convenient as this was for us, it did of course pose the uncomfortable question of why the site had been completely abandoned when it was obviously far from depleted.

Me, Vinson, Loebald, and Klaus were chipping away at the crystal sap, tossing what we could into a nearby trolley cart. When it was full, Hamm and Gristle would haul it off so that Fish and Chips could scoop it into twenty-kilogram bags, which Hamm and Gristle would then stack and secure onto skids.

And as always, Vothstag supervised.

“Sixteen bleedin’ tons of this bilge,” Vinson muttered as he took a swing at it with his pickaxe. “And he’s got the nerve to tell us it’s just an appetizer for a party guest. What do you suppose they’re going to do with it all.”

“Refine it into proper syrup, I imagine,” Loewald replied. “Make it into sweets and sodas, or just drizzle some of it straight onto flapjacks. Either way, they’ll make a killing. Sixteen tons will probably sell for millions.”

“Why though? Is it just exotic sugar?” I asked.

“What do you think?” Loewald asked rhetorically, gesturing at the source. “For reality benders, anything from the edges of reality is potent stuff. They put a lump of this in their morning coffee, and the Veil will seem as weak to them as it is here. There’s no telling what havoc they’ll get up to, so you better hope we’re not around to see.”

“Now you’re just being ridiculous. Clowns don’t drink coffee,” Vinson joked.

I was about to ask him how he would know, when Vothstag put his hand on my shoulder and spun me around. Hamm and Gristle had returned with the empty cart, but only Gristle was getting ready to pull the full one. Vothstag spewed some of his usual gibberish, gesturing at me and then towards Hamm’s empty space at the cart.

“Because I sang one line? Seriously?” I asked. I was about to throw Loewald under the bus for singing in the first place, but Vothstag was already roaring incomprehensibly. “Alright, alright. I’ll pull the damn cart.”

I handed my pickaxe over to Hamm, who instantly began swinging at the sap with manic enthusiasm. Gristle gave me a slight nod of condolence before Vothstag yoked me up to the cart like an ox and then sent us on our way with an angry shout.

“If you don’t mind me asking, how come Hamm deserves a break and you don’t?” I asked Gristle as we made our way down the track, the dinging of our colleague’s pickaxes slowly fading into the background.

Gristle looked over his shoulder to confirm the Vothstag was well out of earshot, and then turned his head towards mine.

“Vinson’s wrong, you know,” he said in a soft, conspiratorial whisper.

“Ah… I’m story?” I asked.

“About Clowns and coffee,” he clarified. “Icky drinks coffee. I’ve seen her do it. She takes it with double cream and sugar to keep it Clown Kosher, of course. She’s a little too classy to indulge in stereotypical candy binges, but she’s still got a sweet tooth like the rest of us.”

“…Us?” I asked uneasily.

Gristle nodded, lifting up his gas mask by the filter and revealing his face to me for the first time. His poreless skin was a lustrous white, but his lips, nose, and the space around his eyes were all pitch black, and the eyes themselves sparkled with the light of a thousand dying stars. His mouth was spread into an unnaturally wide smile, revealing that his teeth were not only perfect but shiny to the point that I could see myself in them.

And I looked terrified.

“Loewald was right though, about what this stuff will do to us,” he went on. “Once everything’s fully loaded, Hamm and I are going to take a mouthful each and then take the whole haul for ourselves. We’ll stash some of it away somewhere safe, then use the rest to buy our way back into the Circus. The only problem is getting there. That’s where you come in.”

“What are you on about? How can I possibly help you get back to your Circus?” I asked.

“With that Seelie coin you got in your pocket,” he said, lowering his voice so that I only barely heard him. “These carts weren’t meant to be powered manually, you know. They run on Faerie magic, and that coin’s got enough that we can drive all sixteen tons of our loot to anywhere in the worlds we want.”

I briefly considered denying that I even had the coin, but if he was determined, he could find and take it easily enough, so there really wasn’t any point.

“Ignoring for the moment how you even know I have that, why not ask Vinson?” I suggested. “He’s got way more Seelie Silver than I do.”

“He doesn’t want out. You do,” Gristle responded. “You tried to escape once, and I know you’re just itching for a chance to try again.”

“But… Ignazio knows what you are, doesn’t he? He wouldn’t have let you around the sap if he wasn’t prepared for you to try to take some,” I said.

“He doesn’t know Hamm and I can take our masks off without his say-so,” Gristle explained. “We’ve been living off meagre rations of powdered milk to keep us in line, but we were able to get a hold of a bottle of the fresh stuff and chugged it before we came here. Ignazio and Vothstag have no power over us right now.”

“… I’m sorry, milk?” I asked confused.

“Not important at the moment. Are you in or not?” he asked.

I considered his proposition for a moment, deciding on one final question before answering.    

“Why not just take the coin from me?”

“Because I’m a nice guy,” he said with a sickeningly wide grin. “And… stealing Seelie Silver tends not to end well. I don’t need an answer now. The load’s not full yet. Think about it, and when the time comes, do whatever you’ve got to do.”

He pulled his mask back down, and we finished hauling the cart over to Fish and Chips in silence.

He wasn’t wrong about me wanting to escape, but my plan had always been to quietly sneak off and be long gone before anyone noticed. A fight between Vothstag and a pair of superpowered Clowns followed by a daring getaway on an Unseelie mining cart was a bit riskier than anything I had envisioned. But at the same time, this was an unprecedented opportunity that would likely never come again.  From the Taproots of the World Tree, I could go literally anywhere, and never have to worry about Ignazio or his minions tracking me down.

All it would cost me was the single coin I had to my name.

I hauled the cart with Gristle for the rest of the shift. Eventually, we had a train of sixteen pallets, each loaded with fifty twenty-kilogram sacks of crystalized sap.

“That’s it then. Order’s full,” Vinson declared as he walked the length of the train, testing the chains to make sure the cargo was fully secured. “All of you hop in the front and let’s get the hell out of here.”

Vothstag roared in disagreement, standing between us and the cart and making a vaguely groping gesture.

“Right, right. Contraband check,” Vinson nodded with a weary sigh as he outstretched his arms. “Nothing too invasive now, you hear? If this stuff was inside of us, you’d already know it.”

Vothstag didn’t acknowledge his comment, but proceeded to pat him down and empty his pockets.

Hamm and Gristle each gave me a knowing look. If I did nothing, Vothstag would find my coin and it would all be over for me anyway. I nodded my assent, and braced myself for the worse.

With a single swift motion, Hamm and Gristle each pulled their masks off, and the visages of the two monstrous Clowns were enough to throw all of us into immediate pandemonium. Hamm’s hair, eyes, lips and nose were all a fiery red, and I saw now that the tips of their ears had a pink tinge, just like their fingers. The instant their masks were off, they wasted no time shovelling a handful of crystal sap into their mouths.

Vothstag howled and charged straight at them, and everyone else scattered as quickly as they could to avoid being bulldozed by the massive deer man. Hamm and Gristle stood their ground, each of them grabbing ahold of one of his antlers. Despite his size and speed, Vothstag was brought to a dead stop.

He snorted and bellowed as he tried to force himself forward, but he was completely unable to overpower the two Clowns. Hamm and Gristle exchanged sinister smiles and began to spin Vothstag around and around. Within seconds his feet were off the ground, and with each rotation, he gained more and more momentum until his attackers finally let go of his antlers and sent him flying into the distance.

“The rest of you, stay out of our way!” Gristle shouted as he marched towards the front cart, grabbing me by the scruff of my jacket and pulling me along with him.

“Wait, why? Why can’t they come? Why can’t we all go?” I protested.

“We don’t know what half these freaks are and we don’t trust them,” he said as he tossed me onto the cart. “Now drive. Go straight until I say otherwise.”

I looked out at my confused and frightened companions, and took a bit of solace in the fact that they weren’t entirely certain if I had betrayed them or if I was just being kidnapped. I hesitated for a moment, but Hamm’s sharp talons digging into my shoulder were enough to press me into action.

With my coin of Seelie Silver clutched in my right palm, I grabbed a firm hold of the driving shaft and pushed the train forward. It accelerated at a remarkable pace, and before I knew it, we were speeding away from our work site and towards freedom.

“It’s working. It’s actually working,” Gristle laughed in relief.

“Even Vothstag can’t run this fast!” Hamm declared triumphantly. “The whole haul is ours! We’re rich! We’re free!”

I wanted to celebrate with them. I really did. But deep down inside I knew we weren’t out of the woods yet.

“You guys read that dossier Iggy gave us, right?” I asked. “The Naught Things that gnaw the Taproots are attracted to ontological anchors – anything that’s more real than its surroundings. If you guys are reality benders, and you just ate a massive power-up, doesn’t that make you the realest things here?”

“Isn’t that cute? He thinks he knows more about ontodynamics than us because he read a dossier,” Hamm scoffed.

“This isn’t our first time on the fringes of the unreal, boy!” Gristle replied. “You just drive this train, and let us worry about –”

Without warning, the Taproot split open ahead of us into a fuming, festering chasm. The ground quake was enough to completely derail the train, and I ducked and rolled while I had the chance.

When I came out of the roll, I looked up to see a titanic, disfigured, and disembodied head rising out of the chasm. The size and proportions of the entity fluctuated wildly, as if I was only looking at the three-dimensional facets of it like the World Tree itself. It was encrusted with some kind of dark barnacles, and anything that wasn’t its face was covered in thousands of squirming and feathery tentacles of every conceivable length. It had no nose, but several mouths which chanted backwards-sounding words in synchronicity with each other, dropping rotting black teeth every time they opened and closed. 

There were six randomly spaced and variously sized eyeballs darting around independently of each other, each glowing with a sickly yellow light. I was paralyzed in fear, terrified that the Naught Thing would see me, but all six of its eyes soon locked onto Hamm and Gristle.

As it slowly ascended upwards like a hot air balloon, a pair of flickering tongues shot out of two of its mouths with predatory intent. The Clowns were scooped up like flies, screaming as they were whisked back into the Naught Thing’s cavernous maws. I don’t know much about Clowns or what they’re capable of, only that Hamm and Gristle never got a chance to test their mettle against this behemoth. A few chomps of its black teeth, and it was all over.

I sat there in silence, watching as the Naught Thing continued to drift away, never daring to assume that it had forgotten about me.

“Brandon!” I heard a voice call from the distance.

I was finally able to pull my eyes off the Naught Thing, and when I looked down the track, I saw the rest of my crew hurrying towards me.

Which included a very angry Vothstag.

Grabbing me by the jacket and lifting me off the ground, he roared furiously in my face, demanding answers.

“Easy, Vothstag, easy!” Vinson insisted. “They just grabbed the kid. It wasn’t his idea.”

Vothstag growled skeptically, eyeing the toppled train beside us. He knew it could have only been driven like that by Seelie magic, and I still had my lucky coin clutched tightly in my right hand.

“…Hamm must have picked my pocket when he was working alongside us,” Vinson suggested.

I knew he didn’t really think that. He knew exactly how many coins he had, and he knew he wasn’t missing any. I don’t know why he covered for me, but I owe him big.

“Serves him right, too. Bloody idiot,” he said with a sad shake of his head as he surveyed the wreckage. “Let this be a lesson for all of you if you ever think about stealing my Seelie Silver! That’s right, Fish and Chips, I’m looking at you!”

Vothstag howled again, clearly unconvinced.

“They took me as a driver so that they could stay focused on defending the train!” I claimed. “If I hadn’t jumped when I did, they may have stood a chance against that giant floating head! I saved our haul!”

Vothstag snorted in contempt, but set me back on my feet. I don’t think he believed me, really, but he knew that Ignazio wouldn’t hold him blameless in this little debacle either, so it was in all of our best interests not to cast aspersions on one another’s stories.

“Listen up, everybody! We’re two men down and we’ve got to get this rig back on the track before some other unspeakable abomination comes along, so get moving!” Vinson ordered.

For once, Vothstag was doing most of the work, using his might to set the carts back on the tracks, while the rest of us just picked up any sacks of sap that had come loose.

“What a bloody joke,” Loewald grumbled as he threw a sack onto a cart. “Down from nine to seven, any of us could still die at any minute, and for what? We mined sixteen tons, and what do we get?”

“Another day older,” I agreed, throwing another sack next to his. “But some days, that’s enough.”",1,1729650476.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

I am using this picture as a reference.

I also attached a picture of the head piece I have already. I am using a styrofoam ring as the base form and have wrapped it using poster board reinforced with coffee stirrers. Then I wrapped everything in foam to give it a uniform look. 

I am planning on putting a cardboard bottom on once the paint dries so I can use it to mount the rest of this piece.

If you have any advice on how to make the rest of it I would really appreciate it! Kinda just winging it atm.

1g9zvgw,https://i.redd.it/e2tv49wl2fwd1.jpeg,My 1st year journey into latte art ,"It has been a year since I started my journey into the world of espresso and latte art. It was definitely a difficult and frustrating, but also satisfying  learning experience. 

I spent the first 6 months just getting the aeration and texturing correct. I must have watched hundreds of YT videos, browsed all the coffee related forums, and of course Reddit. 

My tip for beginners is that you must learn how to steam milk correctly for latte art. Every machine is different. You will have to spend time to get used to how your steam wand operates. Some YT videos may say aerate for only 4-5s but fail to mention they are using a commercial class machine. On my BBP, I have to aerate for 10-18s depending on various factors to get the correct consistency.  If you don’t have the correct milk consistency, then you won’t be able to ‘draw.’

For the past year or two – I’m honestly not sure how long it’s been, actually – I’ve been under contract for an otherworldly masked Lord who calls himself Ignazio di Incognauta. He’s not a demon, exactly. He’s closer to Fae, I think, but I don’t fully understand what he is. I never sought him out. He came to me. I asked him how he even knew who I was, and he slapped me across the face for my insolence.

I still signed up though. That’s how desperate I was. He doesn’t waste his time offering deals to people who can say no.

He sends me and the rest of my crew out on what I can best describe as odd jobs. Half the time – hell, most of the time – I’m not even sure exactly what it is we’re doing. Most of the crew have been around longer than I have, and some of them aren’t human, but they all seem to have a better idea of what’s going on than me.

Our foreman Vothstag is technically the one in charge, but he’s not all there in the head; the top of his cranium’s been removed and a good chunk of his brain’s been scooped out. He mostly just barks guttural nonsense that none of us really understand, but somehow compels us to do what we’re supposed to, even when we don’t know what that is. He’s a hulking hunchback with an overgrown beard who usually wears an elk skull to cover up the hole in his head. If he was ever human, I don’t think he is now.

Vinson is our *de facto* leader, however, since he’s more or less a normal guy that we can relate to. Aside from Vothstag, he’s been working for Ignazio the longest. I won’t bother describing what he looks like, since the rest of us wear gas masks on duty. They’re partially to protect us from environmental and workplace hazards, partially to conceal our identities, but mainly to bring us more easily under Ignazio’s control.

That was why were all wearing our masks on the elevator, incidentally. We were on our way to see the big boss, and our contracts made it very clear we were never to remove our masks in his presence.  

“Come on, Vinson. You know meetings with Iggy never go well,” I replied bluntly.

“Oh, it’s just bluster. You know that. He’s got to put the fear of God into us,” Vinson claimed. “If he wasn’t actually satisfied with our performance, we wouldn’t still be here.”

“No, Brandon’s right. Iggy wouldn’t have called all ten of us in just to hand us our scrip and call us lazy arses,” Loewald chimed in.

“There’s nine of us, now,” Klaus reminded him grimly.

“Right, sorry. Hard to keep track some days,” Loewald admitted. “Regardless; something’s up, and the odds are pretty slim it will be something we like.”

I cringed as Vothstag shouted some of his garbled nonsense back towards Loewald.

“Yes, I know we’re not being paid to have fun, but –”

“We’re not being paid at all!” Klaus interrupted. “None of us are getting any real money until our contracts are up, and have any of you actually known anyone who made it to the end of their contract?” 

He recoiled as Vothstag spun around and began roaring at him, hot spittle flying out from beneath his mask of carved bone as he furiously waved his fist in his face.

“He’s right, Klaus. You’re being paranoid,” Vinson said in an eerily calm tone. “I’ve served out multiple contracts, and I’ve got the silver to prove it.”

He confidently reached into his pocket and held a troy-ounce coin of Seelie Silver between his fingers. Fish and Chips, the pair of three-foot-tall… *somethings* that work for us immediately crowded around him and began eyeing it greedily.

“That’s right boys, take a gander. That’s powerful magic right there, and you’ll get one of these for every moon you’ve worked at the end of your contracts,” he reminded us before quickly pocketing the coin away again. “Unless, of course, you do something to get your contract prematurely terminated; then you’ll have nothing to show for it but a fistful of expired scrip! So keep your heads down, mouths shut, and your eyes on the prize. You’ll have pockets jangling full of coins soon enough.”

As discreetly as I could, I slipped my hands into my pockets and rubbed my one Seelie coin for good luck. None of them knew I had it, because I didn’t want to explain how I got it, but that little bit of fortune it brought me had almost been enough to let me escape [once](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVespersBell/comments/yzlz7s/dont_shop_at_the_isomart_after_dark/).

If I could just muster up the skill to make the best use of my luck, it would be enough to get me out for good one day.

The freight elevator finally came to a stop, and the doors creaked open to reveal the spacious and sumptuous penthouse of our employer. Portraits, animal heads, shields, weapons, and most of all masquerade masks covered nearly every square inch of the walls. Amidst the suits of armour and porcelain vases, there were dozens of priceless ornaments strewn throughout the room. They were incredibly tempting to steal, which was their whole point. Stealing from the boss was a violation of your contract, and you did not want to break your contract.  

The wide windows on the far wall offered a panoramic view of our decaying company town, nestled in a valley between sharp crimson mountains beneath a xanthous sky twinkling with a thousand black stars. You may have heard of such a place before, it has many names, but I will speak none of them here. 

Ignazio was sitting on a reclining couch in front of the fireplace, some paperwork left out on the coffee table and a featureless mask like a silver spiderweb clutched in his hand. Ignazio himself always wore the top half of a golden Oni mask, which in and of itself wasn’t unusual for our company, but the odd thing was that several portraits in the penthouse showed that it had once been a full mask.

I’ve always wondered what happened to the bottom half.  

Aside from that, Ignazio wasn’t too unusual looking. He was tall, skinny, and swarthy with a pronounced chin, tousled dark brown hair and always dressed in doublets of silk and velvet like he was performing Shakespeare or something.

Vothstag went into the room first, with Vinson almost, but not quite, at his side. Fish and Chips scamped after them, followed by Loewald, Klaus, and myself.

The last two members of our crew are called Hamm and Gristle, and they’re the two I know the least about. They keep to themselves, and I don’t think I’ve ever even seen them with their masks off. I have seen them without gloves on though, and both of their hands are white with pink-tinged fingers. I have no idea what that means, but for some reason, I always found it oddly unsettling.

The only thing I know for sure about them is that they’re the only survivors of another crew that tried to run out on their contract, and I know better than to ask for details about that.

“Gentlemen, Gentlemen, right on time,” Ignazio greeted us as he waved us over. He positioned himself on his couch to make it impossible for any of us to sit beside him, and none of us dared to take a seat at any of the clawfooted armchairs that were meant for guests with much higher stations in life. “I’ve got this moon’s scrip books all stamped and approved. You’ll notice they’re a bit light, seeing as how you were slightly behind quota on this assignment.”

None of us objected, and none of us were particularly surprised. I was grateful that the mask hid my expression, and I’m sure I wasn’t the only one. I still had to make an effort to mind my body language though. Being so accustomed to his employees and compatriots wearing masks, Ignazio was quite astute to body language.

Vinson accepted the stack of nine booklets and nodded gratefully.

“We appreciate your leniency, my lord, and look forward to earning back our privileges on our next assignment,” he said.

“I was hoping you’d say that,” Ignazio grinned as he took a sip from his crystal chalice. He set it down on the coffee table and picked up a dossier. “Halloween is fast approaching, and that means we need costumes and candy. Costumes we have in abundance, obviously, but candy’s one vice I don’t usually keep well stocked.”

“So we’re actually stealing candy from babies on our next job?” Klaus asked.

“Nothing so quotidian,” Ignazio sneered. “Remind me; have any of you met Icky before?”

The name meant nothing to me, but I glanced from side to side to see if anyone else reacted to it. I could have sworn I saw Hamm and Gristle perk their heads up slightly.

“She’s that Clown woman, right? The one in charge of that god-awful circus?” Vinson asked.

“I beg your pardon? It’s an enchanted Circus that travels the worlds and offers sanctuary to paranormal vagabonds in need,” Ignazio claimed half-heartedly. “And I might be able to pawn a few of you off on them if it comes to that, so be careful you don’t fall any further behind on your quotas. But you’re right; she is a Clown, with a capital C, and Clowns love candy. She’ll be attending my All Hallows’ Ball this year, and I don’t want her to feel excluded, so we’ll need some real top-shelf candy on offer.”

“Ah… we’re still waiting for the other shoe to drop here, boss,” Vinson confessed as most of us shared nervous glances with one another. “You want us to get candy? Fancy candy? I… I don’t get it. What’s the catch?”   

“Oh god, we’re not taking it from babies: we’re serving the babies with it!” Loewald balked in horror.

“No, but thank you for that highball to make the actual assignment seem more reasonable,” Ignazio said. “No, I’m sending you all down to the Taproots of the World Tree to collect some of the crystalized sap there.”

“The… The Taproots of the World Tree?” Vinson repeated softly. “The physical manifestation of the metaphysical network that binds all the worlds and planes of Creation, gnawed at by the Naught Things trying to break their way into reality? You’re sending us down there… for sweets?”

“Icky swears that Yggdrasil syrup pairs beautifully with French Toast,” he replied blithely. “This is an especially dangerous assignment, so I want you all to read that dossier in full. Emrys has been charting and forging new pathways through the planes from his spire in Adderwood, so thanks to him your trip down at least will be relatively easy.”

“Just… just there and back, right?” Vinson asked desperately, his voice wavering. “Just a handful of the stuff to wow Icky, and we’re done, right?”

A sadistic smirk slowly spread across Ignazio’s face before he told us how much crystalized sap we would need to retrieve.

\*\*\*

“You mine sixteen tons, what do you get? Another day older, and deeper in debt,” Loebald sang as he chipped away at the pulsing amber crystal emerging from the leviathan root.

The World Tree was cosmically colossal, though it’s meaningless to describe its size since I can only describe the parts of it that exist in three dimensions. The twin trunks of the tree snaked around each other like a double helix, each alight with an ever-shifting astral aura that perpetually waxed and waned in synchronicity with its twin. From its crown sprung a seemingly infinite mass of fractally dividing branches, shimmering with countless spherical ‘leaves’ which I knew to be individual universes. The base of the tree spawned an equally infinite mass of sprawling taproots, anchoring it in place and drawing precious sustenance from the edges of reality.  

As dangerous as it was to be there, it was nonetheless a sublime experience. You think that looking upon all of existence like that would fill you with Lovecraftian madness at your own insignificance, but it was far more transcendental than that. On some fundamental level, I recognized that tree. It was Yggdrasil. It was the Biblical tree of Good and Evil. It was the Two Trees of Valinor. That tree was meant to be there, and so was everything inside of it. Sure, it was functionally infinite and everything in it was finite, but the tree wasn’t merely massive; it was intricate. In the grand scheme of things, nothing inside of it was superfluous. Everything, no matter its scale, was part of the ultimate design of the tree. You and I may not be any more important than anyone or anything else, but if we weren’t important, we wouldn’t be here.

I’m not entirely sure if any of my coworkers felt the same way though.

“Saint Peter don’t you call me, ’cause I can’t go,” Loebald continued to sing, only to be interrupted by Vothstag’s irate howling, his eyes burning like coals as he dared him to finish the chorus.

Loebald bowed his head contritely as he awkwardly cleared his throat. When Vothstag was satisfied he had been cowed into silence, he turned around to resume his work.

“’Cause I owe my soul to the company store,” I finished for him, not too loudly, but loud enough that everyone heard me.

Vothstag immediately came charging at me, roaring in fury, but I didn’t flinch. I just let him chew me out for about a minute until I heard something that I was pretty sure was a question.

“That’s ridiculous. You’re making more noise than either of us,” I countered. “And wasting more time. Now if you don’t mind, I’ve got work to do.”

Vothstag sneered at me, but since I had resumed my task, his job as taskmaster was complete, and he left to attend to other matters.

“What the hell are you doing, pushing your luck like that, Brandon?” Vinson whispered.

“He was out of line. Even chain gangs are allowed to sing,” I explained. “Besides, I’m right, aren’t I? If we attract any unwanted attention, it will be because of him.”

“This isn’t the place to cause trouble!” he hissed. “Fill the carts as fast as you can so we can get out of here!”

When we arrived at the Taproots, we saw that we weren’t the first beings to try to mine this deposit of sap. Someone, likely some clan of Unseelie Fae, had established a fairly complex operation with rails and hand carts. As convenient as this was for us, it did of course pose the uncomfortable question of why the site had been completely abandoned when it was obviously far from depleted.

Me, Vinson, Loebald, and Klaus were chipping away at the crystal sap, tossing what we could into a nearby trolley cart. When it was full, Hamm and Gristle would haul it off so that Fish and Chips could scoop it into twenty-kilogram bags, which Hamm and Gristle would then stack and secure onto skids.

And as always, Vothstag supervised.

“Sixteen bleedin’ tons of this bilge,” Vinson muttered as he took a swing at it with his pickaxe. “And he’s got the nerve to tell us it’s just an appetizer for a party guest. What do you suppose they’re going to do with it all.”

“Refine it into proper syrup, I imagine,” Loewald replied. “Make it into sweets and sodas, or just drizzle some of it straight onto flapjacks. Either way, they’ll make a killing. Sixteen tons will probably sell for millions.”

“Why though? Is it just exotic sugar?” I asked.

“What do you think?” Loewald asked rhetorically, gesturing at the source. “For reality benders, anything from the edges of reality is potent stuff. They put a lump of this in their morning coffee, and the Veil will seem as weak to them as it is here. There’s no telling what havoc they’ll get up to, so you better hope we’re not around to see.”

“Now you’re just being ridiculous. Clowns don’t drink coffee,” Vinson joked.

I was about to ask him how he would know, when Vothstag put his hand on my shoulder and spun me around. Hamm and Gristle had returned with the empty cart, but only Gristle was getting ready to pull the full one. Vothstag spewed some of his usual gibberish, gesturing at me and then towards Hamm’s empty space at the cart.

“Because I sang one line? Seriously?” I asked. I was about to throw Loewald under the bus for singing in the first place, but Vothstag was already roaring incomprehensibly. “Alright, alright. I’ll pull the damn cart.”

I handed my pickaxe over to Hamm, who instantly began swinging at the sap with manic enthusiasm. Gristle gave me a slight nod of condolence before Vothstag yoked me up to the cart like an ox and then sent us on our way with an angry shout.

“If you don’t mind me asking, how come Hamm deserves a break and you don’t?” I asked Gristle as we made our way down the track, the dinging of our colleague’s pickaxes slowly fading into the background.

Gristle looked over his shoulder to confirm the Vothstag was well out of earshot, and then turned his head towards mine.

“Vinson’s wrong, you know,” he said in a soft, conspiratorial whisper.

“Ah… I’m story?” I asked.

“About Clowns and coffee,” he clarified. “Icky drinks coffee. I’ve seen her do it. She takes it with double cream and sugar to keep it Clown Kosher, of course. She’s a little too classy to indulge in stereotypical candy binges, but she’s still got a sweet tooth like the rest of us.”

“…Us?” I asked uneasily.

Gristle nodded, lifting up his gas mask by the filter and revealing his face to me for the first time. His poreless skin was a lustrous white, but his lips, nose, and the space around his eyes were all pitch black, and the eyes themselves sparkled with the light of a thousand dying stars. His mouth was spread into an unnaturally wide smile, revealing that his teeth were not only perfect but shiny to the point that I could see myself in them.

And I looked terrified.

“Loewald was right though, about what this stuff will do to us,” he went on. “Once everything’s fully loaded, Hamm and I are going to take a mouthful each and then take the whole haul for ourselves. We’ll stash some of it away somewhere safe, then use the rest to buy our way back into the Circus. The only problem is getting there. That’s where you come in.”

“What are you on about? How can I possibly help you get back to your Circus?” I asked.

“With that Seelie coin you got in your pocket,” he said, lowering his voice so that I only barely heard him. “These carts weren’t meant to be powered manually, you know. They run on Faerie magic, and that coin’s got enough that we can drive all sixteen tons of our loot to anywhere in the worlds we want.”

I briefly considered denying that I even had the coin, but if he was determined, he could find and take it easily enough, so there really wasn’t any point.

“Ignoring for the moment how you even know I have that, why not ask Vinson?” I suggested. “He’s got way more Seelie Silver than I do.”

“He doesn’t want out. You do,” Gristle responded. “You tried to escape once, and I know you’re just itching for a chance to try again.”

“But… Ignazio knows what you are, doesn’t he? He wouldn’t have let you around the sap if he wasn’t prepared for you to try to take some,” I said.

“He doesn’t know Hamm and I can take our masks off without his say-so,” Gristle explained. “We’ve been living off meagre rations of powdered milk to keep us in line, but we were able to get a hold of a bottle of the fresh stuff and chugged it before we came here. Ignazio and Vothstag have no power over us right now.”

“… I’m sorry, milk?” I asked confused.

“Not important at the moment. Are you in or not?” he asked.

I considered his proposition for a moment, deciding on one final question before answering.    

“Why not just take the coin from me?”

“Because I’m a nice guy,” he said with a sickeningly wide grin. “And… stealing Seelie Silver tends not to end well. I don’t need an answer now. The load’s not full yet. Think about it, and when the time comes, do whatever you’ve got to do.”

He pulled his mask back down, and we finished hauling the cart over to Fish and Chips in silence.

He wasn’t wrong about me wanting to escape, but my plan had always been to quietly sneak off and be long gone before anyone noticed. A fight between Vothstag and a pair of superpowered Clowns followed by a daring getaway on an Unseelie mining cart was a bit riskier than anything I had envisioned. But at the same time, this was an unprecedented opportunity that would likely never come again.  From the Taproots of the World Tree, I could go literally anywhere, and never have to worry about Ignazio or his minions tracking me down.

All it would cost me was the single coin I had to my name.

I hauled the cart with Gristle for the rest of the shift. Eventually, we had a train of sixteen pallets, each loaded with fifty twenty-kilogram sacks of crystalized sap.

“That’s it then. Order’s full,” Vinson declared as he walked the length of the train, testing the chains to make sure the cargo was fully secured. “All of you hop in the front and let’s get the hell out of here.”

Vothstag roared in disagreement, standing between us and the cart and making a vaguely groping gesture.

“Right, right. Contraband check,” Vinson nodded with a weary sigh as he outstretched his arms. “Nothing too invasive now, you hear? If this stuff was inside of us, you’d already know it.”

Vothstag didn’t acknowledge his comment, but proceeded to pat him down and empty his pockets.

Hamm and Gristle each gave me a knowing look. If I did nothing, Vothstag would find my coin and it would all be over for me anyway. I nodded my assent, and braced myself for the worse.

With a single swift motion, Hamm and Gristle each pulled their masks off, and the visages of the two monstrous Clowns were enough to throw all of us into immediate pandemonium. Hamm’s hair, eyes, lips and nose were all a fiery red, and I saw now that the tips of their ears had a pink tinge, just like their fingers. The instant their masks were off, they wasted no time shovelling a handful of crystal sap into their mouths.

Vothstag howled and charged straight at them, and everyone else scattered as quickly as they could to avoid being bulldozed by the massive deer man. Hamm and Gristle stood their ground, each of them grabbing ahold of one of his antlers. Despite his size and speed, Vothstag was brought to a dead stop.

He snorted and bellowed as he tried to force himself forward, but he was completely unable to overpower the two Clowns. Hamm and Gristle exchanged sinister smiles and began to spin Vothstag around and around. Within seconds his feet were off the ground, and with each rotation, he gained more and more momentum until his attackers finally let go of his antlers and sent him flying into the distance.

“The rest of you, stay out of our way!” Gristle shouted as he marched towards the front cart, grabbing me by the scruff of my jacket and pulling me along with him.

“Wait, why? Why can’t they come? Why can’t we all go?” I protested.

“We don’t know what half these freaks are and we don’t trust them,” he said as he tossed me onto the cart. “Now drive. Go straight until I say otherwise.”

I looked out at my confused and frightened companions, and took a bit of solace in the fact that they weren’t entirely certain if I had betrayed them or if I was just being kidnapped. I hesitated for a moment, but Hamm’s sharp talons digging into my shoulder were enough to press me into action.

With my coin of Seelie Silver clutched in my right palm, I grabbed a firm hold of the driving shaft and pushed the train forward. It accelerated at a remarkable pace, and before I knew it, we were speeding away from our work site and towards freedom.

“It’s working. It’s actually working,” Gristle laughed in relief.

“Even Vothstag can’t run this fast!” Hamm declared triumphantly. “The whole haul is ours! We’re rich! We’re free!”

I wanted to celebrate with them. I really did. But deep down inside I knew we weren’t out of the woods yet.

“You guys read that dossier Iggy gave us, right?” I asked. “The Naught Things that gnaw the Taproots are attracted to ontological anchors – anything that’s more real than its surroundings. If you guys are reality benders, and you just ate a massive power-up, doesn’t that make you the realest things here?”

“Isn’t that cute? He thinks he knows more about ontodynamics than us because he read a dossier,” Hamm scoffed.

“This isn’t our first time on the fringes of the unreal, boy!” Gristle replied. “You just drive this train, and let us worry about –”

Without warning, the Taproot split open ahead of us into a fuming, festering chasm. The ground quake was enough to completely derail the train, and I ducked and rolled while I had the chance.

When I came out of the roll, I looked up to see a titanic, disfigured, and disembodied head rising out of the chasm. The size and proportions of the entity fluctuated wildly, as if I was only looking at the three-dimensional facets of it like the World Tree itself. It was encrusted with some kind of dark barnacles, and anything that wasn’t its face was covered in thousands of squirming and feathery tentacles of every conceivable length. It had no nose, but several mouths which chanted backwards-sounding words in synchronicity with each other, dropping rotting black teeth every time they opened and closed. 

There were six randomly spaced and variously sized eyeballs darting around independently of each other, each glowing with a sickly yellow light. I was paralyzed in fear, terrified that the Naught Thing would see me, but all six of its eyes soon locked onto Hamm and Gristle.

As it slowly ascended upwards like a hot air balloon, a pair of flickering tongues shot out of two of its mouths with predatory intent. The Clowns were scooped up like flies, screaming as they were whisked back into the Naught Thing’s cavernous maws. I don’t know much about Clowns or what they’re capable of, only that Hamm and Gristle never got a chance to test their mettle against this behemoth. A few chomps of its black teeth, and it was all over.

I sat there in silence, watching as the Naught Thing continued to drift away, never daring to assume that it had forgotten about me.

“Brandon!” I heard a voice call from the distance.

I was finally able to pull my eyes off the Naught Thing, and when I looked down the track, I saw the rest of my crew hurrying towards me.

Which included a very angry Vothstag.

Grabbing me by the jacket and lifting me off the ground, he roared furiously in my face, demanding answers.

“Easy, Vothstag, easy!” Vinson insisted. “They just grabbed the kid. It wasn’t his idea.”

Vothstag growled skeptically, eyeing the toppled train beside us. He knew it could have only been driven like that by Seelie magic, and I still had my lucky coin clutched tightly in my right hand.

“…Hamm must have picked my pocket when he was working alongside us,” Vinson suggested.

I knew he didn’t really think that. He knew exactly how many coins he had, and he knew he wasn’t missing any. I don’t know why he covered for me, but I owe him big.

“Serves him right, too. Bloody idiot,” he said with a sad shake of his head as he surveyed the wreckage. “Let this be a lesson for all of you if you ever think about stealing my Seelie Silver! That’s right, Fish and Chips, I’m looking at you!”

Vothstag howled again, clearly unconvinced.

“They took me as a driver so that they could stay focused on defending the train!” I claimed. “If I hadn’t jumped when I did, they may have stood a chance against that giant floating head! I saved our haul!”

Vothstag snorted in contempt, but set me back on my feet. I don’t think he believed me, really, but he knew that Ignazio wouldn’t hold him blameless in this little debacle either, so it was in all of our best interests not to cast aspersions on one another’s stories.

“Listen up, everybody! We’re two men down and we’ve got to get this rig back on the track before some other unspeakable abomination comes along, so get moving!” Vinson ordered.

For once, Vothstag was doing most of the work, using his might to set the carts back on the tracks, while the rest of us just picked up any sacks of sap that had come loose.

“What a bloody joke,” Loewald grumbled as he threw a sack onto a cart. “Down from nine to seven, any of us could still die at any minute, and for what? We mined sixteen tons, and what do we get?”

“Another day older,” I agreed, throwing another sack next to his. “But some days, that’s enough.”",1,1729650329.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1g9zu9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1g9zu9e/holiday_cafe_brunch_mixer/,Holiday Cafe & Brunch Mixer,"For the past 11 years, I have hosted an evening holiday cocktail mixer with heavy apps/sides for about 40-50 people annually. I always make the same food and generally have the same vibe. This year I was thinking of switching it up and doing something different. I was thinking of hosting a Brunch mixer and having a coffee bar, mimosas bar, and bagel bar with topping and maybe a few other dishes set up for a mid-day party instead of in the evening. 

However, I have been unable to find anyone on the internet who has done something similar. I'm sure this is not a new concept but it just hasn't been digitally documented. Posing a few questions to this thread:

1. Would you be excited to receive an invite to this type of party? (particularly day time vs night time.)
2. What would you serve at this type of party? How many different types of coffee would you serve? What food would you make for that many people to casually graze on?
3. How would you manage the vibe of the party since more people will likely be coming and going rather than showing up st the beginning and staying all night?",2,1729650271.0,Cooking,0,1.0,False
1g9ztvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1g9ztvp/sixteen_tons/,Sixteen Tons,"“What’s got you in such a sour mood, Brandon? It’s payday!” my veteran colleague Vinson asked as the rusty freight elevator noisily rattled its way up towards the penthouse suite.

For the past year or two – I’m honestly not sure how long it’s been, actually – I’ve been under contract for an otherworldly masked Lord who calls himself Ignazio di Incognauta. He’s not a demon, exactly. He’s closer to Fae, I think, but I don’t fully understand what he is. I never sought him out. He came to me. I asked him how he even knew who I was, and he slapped me across the face for my insolence.

I still signed up though. That’s how desperate I was. He doesn’t waste his time offering deals to people who can say no.

He sends me and the rest of my crew out on what I can best describe as odd jobs. Half the time – hell, most of the time – I’m not even sure exactly what it is we’re doing. Most of the crew have been around longer than I have, and some of them aren’t human, but they all seem to have a better idea of what’s going on than me.

Our foreman Vothstag is technically the one in charge, but he’s not all there in the head; the top of his cranium’s been removed and a good chunk of his brain’s been scooped out. He mostly just barks guttural nonsense that none of us really understand, but somehow compels us to do what we’re supposed to, even when we don’t know what that is. He’s a hulking hunchback with an overgrown beard who usually wears an elk skull to cover up the hole in his head. If he was ever human, I don’t think he is now.

Vinson is our *de facto* leader, however, since he’s more or less a normal guy that we can relate to. Aside from Vothstag, he’s been working for Ignazio the longest. I won’t bother describing what he looks like, since the rest of us wear gas masks on duty. They’re partially to protect us from environmental and workplace hazards, partially to conceal our identities, but mainly to bring us more easily under Ignazio’s control.

That was why were all wearing our masks on the elevator, incidentally. We were on our way to see the big boss, and our contracts made it very clear we were never to remove our masks in his presence.  

“Come on, Vinson. You know meetings with Iggy never go well,” I replied bluntly.

“Oh, it’s just bluster. You know that. He’s got to put the fear of God into us,” Vinson claimed. “If he wasn’t actually satisfied with our performance, we wouldn’t still be here.”

“No, Brandon’s right. Iggy wouldn’t have called all ten of us in just to hand us our scrip and call us lazy arses,” Loewald chimed in.

“There’s nine of us, now,” Klaus reminded him grimly.

“Right, sorry. Hard to keep track some days,” Loewald admitted. “Regardless; something’s up, and the odds are pretty slim it will be something we like.”

I cringed as Vothstag shouted some of his garbled nonsense back towards Loewald.

“Yes, I know we’re not being paid to have fun, but –”

“We’re not being paid at all!” Klaus interrupted. “None of us are getting any real money until our contracts are up, and have any of you actually known anyone who made it to the end of their contract?” 

He recoiled as Vothstag spun around and began roaring at him, hot spittle flying out from beneath his mask of carved bone as he furiously waved his fist in his face.

“He’s right, Klaus. You’re being paranoid,” Vinson said in an eerily calm tone. “I’ve served out multiple contracts, and I’ve got the silver to prove it.”

He confidently reached into his pocket and held a troy-ounce coin of Seelie Silver between his fingers. Fish and Chips, the pair of three-foot-tall… *somethings* that work for us immediately crowded around him and began eyeing it greedily.

“That’s right boys, take a gander. That’s powerful magic right there, and you’ll get one of these for every moon you’ve worked at the end of your contracts,” he reminded us before quickly pocketing the coin away again. “Unless, of course, you do something to get your contract prematurely terminated; then you’ll have nothing to show for it but a fistful of expired scrip! So keep your heads down, mouths shut, and your eyes on the prize. You’ll have pockets jangling full of coins soon enough.”

As discreetly as I could, I slipped my hands into my pockets and rubbed my one Seelie coin for good luck. None of them knew I had it, because I didn’t want to explain how I got it, but that little bit of fortune it brought me had almost been enough to let me escape [once](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVespersBell/comments/yzlz7s/dont_shop_at_the_isomart_after_dark/).

If I could just muster up the skill to make the best use of my luck, it would be enough to get me out for good one day.

The freight elevator finally came to a stop, and the doors creaked open to reveal the spacious and sumptuous penthouse of our employer. Portraits, animal heads, shields, weapons, and most of all masquerade masks covered nearly every square inch of the walls. Amidst the suits of armour and porcelain vases, there were dozens of priceless ornaments strewn throughout the room. They were incredibly tempting to steal, which was their whole point. Stealing from the boss was a violation of your contract, and you did not want to break your contract.  

The wide windows on the far wall offered a panoramic view of our decaying company town, nestled in a valley between sharp crimson mountains beneath a xanthous sky twinkling with a thousand black stars. You may have heard of such a place before, it has many names, but I will speak none of them here. 

Ignazio was sitting on a reclining couch in front of the fireplace, some paperwork left out on the coffee table and a featureless mask like a silver spiderweb clutched in his hand. Ignazio himself always wore the top half of a golden Oni mask, which in and of itself wasn’t unusual for our company, but the odd thing was that several portraits in the penthouse showed that it had once been a full mask.

I’ve always wondered what happened to the bottom half.  

Aside from that, Ignazio wasn’t too unusual looking. He was tall, skinny, and swarthy with a pronounced chin, tousled dark brown hair and always dressed in doublets of silk and velvet like he was performing Shakespeare or something.

Vothstag went into the room first, with Vinson almost, but not quite, at his side. Fish and Chips scamped after them, followed by Loewald, Klaus, and myself.

The last two members of our crew are called Hamm and Gristle, and they’re the two I know the least about. They keep to themselves, and I don’t think I’ve ever even seen them with their masks off. I have seen them without gloves on though, and both of their hands are white with pink-tinged fingers. I have no idea what that means, but for some reason, I always found it oddly unsettling.

The only thing I know for sure about them is that they’re the only survivors of another crew that tried to run out on their contract, and I know better than to ask for details about that.

“Gentlemen, Gentlemen, right on time,” Ignazio greeted us as he waved us over. He positioned himself on his couch to make it impossible for any of us to sit beside him, and none of us dared to take a seat at any of the clawfooted armchairs that were meant for guests with much higher stations in life. “I’ve got this moon’s scrip books all stamped and approved. You’ll notice they’re a bit light, seeing as how you were slightly behind quota on this assignment.”

None of us objected, and none of us were particularly surprised. I was grateful that the mask hid my expression, and I’m sure I wasn’t the only one. I still had to make an effort to mind my body language though. Being so accustomed to his employees and compatriots wearing masks, Ignazio was quite astute to body language.

Vinson accepted the stack of nine booklets and nodded gratefully.

“We appreciate your leniency, my lord, and look forward to earning back our privileges on our next assignment,” he said.

“I was hoping you’d say that,” Ignazio grinned as he took a sip from his crystal chalice. He set it down on the coffee table and picked up a dossier. “Halloween is fast approaching, and that means we need costumes and candy. Costumes we have in abundance, obviously, but candy’s one vice I don’t usually keep well stocked.”

“So we’re actually stealing candy from babies on our next job?” Klaus asked.

“Nothing so quotidian,” Ignazio sneered. “Remind me; have any of you met Icky before?”

The name meant nothing to me, but I glanced from side to side to see if anyone else reacted to it. I could have sworn I saw Hamm and Gristle perk their heads up slightly.

“She’s that Clown woman, right? The one in charge of that god-awful circus?” Vinson asked.

“I beg your pardon? It’s an enchanted Circus that travels the worlds and offers sanctuary to paranormal vagabonds in need,” Ignazio claimed half-heartedly. “And I might be able to pawn a few of you off on them if it comes to that, so be careful you don’t fall any further behind on your quotas. But you’re right; she is a Clown, with a capital C, and Clowns love candy. She’ll be attending my All Hallows’ Ball this year, and I don’t want her to feel excluded, so we’ll need some real top-shelf candy on offer.”

“Ah… we’re still waiting for the other shoe to drop here, boss,” Vinson confessed as most of us shared nervous glances with one another. “You want us to get candy? Fancy candy? I… I don’t get it. What’s the catch?”   

“Oh god, we’re not taking it from babies: we’re serving the babies with it!” Loewald balked in horror.

“No, but thank you for that highball to make the actual assignment seem more reasonable,” Ignazio said. “No, I’m sending you all down to the Taproots of the World Tree to collect some of the crystalized sap there.”

“The… The Taproots of the World Tree?” Vinson repeated softly. “The physical manifestation of the metaphysical network that binds all the worlds and planes of Creation, gnawed at by the Naught Things trying to break their way into reality? You’re sending us down there… for sweets?”

“Icky swears that Yggdrasil syrup pairs beautifully with French Toast,” he replied blithely. “This is an especially dangerous assignment, so I want you all to read that dossier in full. Emrys has been charting and forging new pathways through the planes from his spire in Adderwood, so thanks to him your trip down at least will be relatively easy.”

“Just… just there and back, right?” Vinson asked desperately, his voice wavering. “Just a handful of the stuff to wow Icky, and we’re done, right?”

A sadistic smirk slowly spread across Ignazio’s face before he told us how much crystalized sap we would need to retrieve.

\*\*\*

“You mine sixteen tons, what do you get? Another day older, and deeper in debt,” Loebald sang as he chipped away at the pulsing amber crystal emerging from the leviathan root.

The World Tree was cosmically colossal, though it’s meaningless to describe its size since I can only describe the parts of it that exist in three dimensions. The twin trunks of the tree snaked around each other like a double helix, each alight with an ever-shifting astral aura that perpetually waxed and waned in synchronicity with its twin. From its crown sprung a seemingly infinite mass of fractally dividing branches, shimmering with countless spherical ‘leaves’ which I knew to be individual universes. The base of the tree spawned an equally infinite mass of sprawling taproots, anchoring it in place and drawing precious sustenance from the edges of reality.  

As dangerous as it was to be there, it was nonetheless a sublime experience. You think that looking upon all of existence like that would fill you with Lovecraftian madness at your own insignificance, but it was far more transcendental than that. On some fundamental level, I recognized that tree. It was Yggdrasil. It was the Biblical tree of Good and Evil. It was the Two Trees of Valinor. That tree was meant to be there, and so was everything inside of it. Sure, it was functionally infinite and everything in it was finite, but the tree wasn’t merely massive; it was intricate. In the grand scheme of things, nothing inside of it was superfluous. Everything, no matter its scale, was part of the ultimate design of the tree. You and I may not be any more important than anyone or anything else, but if we weren’t important, we wouldn’t be here.

I’m not entirely sure if any of my coworkers felt the same way though.

“Saint Peter don’t you call me, ’cause I can’t go,” Loebald continued to sing, only to be interrupted by Vothstag’s irate howling, his eyes burning like coals as he dared him to finish the chorus.

Loebald bowed his head contritely as he awkwardly cleared his throat. When Vothstag was satisfied he had been cowed into silence, he turned around to resume his work.

“’Cause I owe my soul to the company store,” I finished for him, not too loudly, but loud enough that everyone heard me.

Vothstag immediately came charging at me, roaring in fury, but I didn’t flinch. I just let him chew me out for about a minute until I heard something that I was pretty sure was a question.

“That’s ridiculous. You’re making more noise than either of us,” I countered. “And wasting more time. Now if you don’t mind, I’ve got work to do.”

Vothstag sneered at me, but since I had resumed my task, his job as taskmaster was complete, and he left to attend to other matters.

“What the hell are you doing, pushing your luck like that, Brandon?” Vinson whispered.

“He was out of line. Even chain gangs are allowed to sing,” I explained. “Besides, I’m right, aren’t I? If we attract any unwanted attention, it will be because of him.”

“This isn’t the place to cause trouble!” he hissed. “Fill the carts as fast as you can so we can get out of here!”

When we arrived at the Taproots, we saw that we weren’t the first beings to try to mine this deposit of sap. Someone, likely some clan of Unseelie Fae, had established a fairly complex operation with rails and hand carts. As convenient as this was for us, it did of course pose the uncomfortable question of why the site had been completely abandoned when it was obviously far from depleted.

Me, Vinson, Loebald, and Klaus were chipping away at the crystal sap, tossing what we could into a nearby trolley cart. When it was full, Hamm and Gristle would haul it off so that Fish and Chips could scoop it into twenty-kilogram bags, which Hamm and Gristle would then stack and secure onto skids.

And as always, Vothstag supervised.

“Sixteen bleedin’ tons of this bilge,” Vinson muttered as he took a swing at it with his pickaxe. “And he’s got the nerve to tell us it’s just an appetizer for a party guest. What do you suppose they’re going to do with it all.”

“Refine it into proper syrup, I imagine,” Loewald replied. “Make it into sweets and sodas, or just drizzle some of it straight onto flapjacks. Either way, they’ll make a killing. Sixteen tons will probably sell for millions.”

“Why though? Is it just exotic sugar?” I asked.

“What do you think?” Loewald asked rhetorically, gesturing at the source. “For reality benders, anything from the edges of reality is potent stuff. They put a lump of this in their morning coffee, and the Veil will seem as weak to them as it is here. There’s no telling what havoc they’ll get up to, so you better hope we’re not around to see.”

“Now you’re just being ridiculous. Clowns don’t drink coffee,” Vinson joked.

I was about to ask him how he would know, when Vothstag put his hand on my shoulder and spun me around. Hamm and Gristle had returned with the empty cart, but only Gristle was getting ready to pull the full one. Vothstag spewed some of his usual gibberish, gesturing at me and then towards Hamm’s empty space at the cart.

“Because I sang one line? Seriously?” I asked. I was about to throw Loewald under the bus for singing in the first place, but Vothstag was already roaring incomprehensibly. “Alright, alright. I’ll pull the damn cart.”

I handed my pickaxe over to Hamm, who instantly began swinging at the sap with manic enthusiasm. Gristle gave me a slight nod of condolence before Vothstag yoked me up to the cart like an ox and then sent us on our way with an angry shout.

“If you don’t mind me asking, how come Hamm deserves a break and you don’t?” I asked Gristle as we made our way down the track, the dinging of our colleague’s pickaxes slowly fading into the background.

Gristle looked over his shoulder to confirm the Vothstag was well out of earshot, and then turned his head towards mine.

“Vinson’s wrong, you know,” he said in a soft, conspiratorial whisper.

“Ah… I’m story?” I asked.

“About Clowns and coffee,” he clarified. “Icky drinks coffee. I’ve seen her do it. She takes it with double cream and sugar to keep it Clown Kosher, of course. She’s a little too classy to indulge in stereotypical candy binges, but she’s still got a sweet tooth like the rest of us.”

“…Us?” I asked uneasily.

Gristle nodded, lifting up his gas mask by the filter and revealing his face to me for the first time. His poreless skin was a lustrous white, but his lips, nose, and the space around his eyes were all pitch black, and the eyes themselves sparkled with the light of a thousand dying stars. His mouth was spread into an unnaturally wide smile, revealing that his teeth were not only perfect but shiny to the point that I could see myself in them.

And I looked terrified.

“Loewald was right though, about what this stuff will do to us,” he went on. “Once everything’s fully loaded, Hamm and I are going to take a mouthful each and then take the whole haul for ourselves. We’ll stash some of it away somewhere safe, then use the rest to buy our way back into the Circus. The only problem is getting there. That’s where you come in.”

“What are you on about? How can I possibly help you get back to your Circus?” I asked.

“With that Seelie coin you got in your pocket,” he said, lowering his voice so that I only barely heard him. “These carts weren’t meant to be powered manually, you know. They run on Faerie magic, and that coin’s got enough that we can drive all sixteen tons of our loot to anywhere in the worlds we want.”

I briefly considered denying that I even had the coin, but if he was determined, he could find and take it easily enough, so there really wasn’t any point.

“Ignoring for the moment how you even know I have that, why not ask Vinson?” I suggested. “He’s got way more Seelie Silver than I do.”

“He doesn’t want out. You do,” Gristle responded. “You tried to escape once, and I know you’re just itching for a chance to try again.”

“But… Ignazio knows what you are, doesn’t he? He wouldn’t have let you around the sap if he wasn’t prepared for you to try to take some,” I said.

“He doesn’t know Hamm and I can take our masks off without his say-so,” Gristle explained. “We’ve been living off meagre rations of powdered milk to keep us in line, but we were able to get a hold of a bottle of the fresh stuff and chugged it before we came here. Ignazio and Vothstag have no power over us right now.”

“… I’m sorry, milk?” I asked confused.

“Not important at the moment. Are you in or not?” he asked.

I considered his proposition for a moment, deciding on one final question before answering.    

“Why not just take the coin from me?”

“Because I’m a nice guy,” he said with a sickeningly wide grin. “And… stealing Seelie Silver tends not to end well. I don’t need an answer now. The load’s not full yet. Think about it, and when the time comes, do whatever you’ve got to do.”

He pulled his mask back down, and we finished hauling the cart over to Fish and Chips in silence.

He wasn’t wrong about me wanting to escape, but my plan had always been to quietly sneak off and be long gone before anyone noticed. A fight between Vothstag and a pair of superpowered Clowns followed by a daring getaway on an Unseelie mining cart was a bit riskier than anything I had envisioned. But at the same time, this was an unprecedented opportunity that would likely never come again.  From the Taproots of the World Tree, I could go literally anywhere, and never have to worry about Ignazio or his minions tracking me down.

All it would cost me was the single coin I had to my name.

I hauled the cart with Gristle for the rest of the shift. Eventually, we had a train of sixteen pallets, each loaded with fifty twenty-kilogram sacks of crystalized sap.

“That’s it then. Order’s full,” Vinson declared as he walked the length of the train, testing the chains to make sure the cargo was fully secured. “All of you hop in the front and let’s get the hell out of here.”

Vothstag roared in disagreement, standing between us and the cart and making a vaguely groping gesture.

“Right, right. Contraband check,” Vinson nodded with a weary sigh as he outstretched his arms. “Nothing too invasive now, you hear? If this stuff was inside of us, you’d already know it.”

Vothstag didn’t acknowledge his comment, but proceeded to pat him down and empty his pockets.

Hamm and Gristle each gave me a knowing look. If I did nothing, Vothstag would find my coin and it would all be over for me anyway. I nodded my assent, and braced myself for the worse.

With a single swift motion, Hamm and Gristle each pulled their masks off, and the visages of the two monstrous Clowns were enough to throw all of us into immediate pandemonium. Hamm’s hair, eyes, lips and nose were all a fiery red, and I saw now that the tips of their ears had a pink tinge, just like their fingers. The instant their masks were off, they wasted no time shovelling a handful of crystal sap into their mouths.

Vothstag howled and charged straight at them, and everyone else scattered as quickly as they could to avoid being bulldozed by the massive deer man. Hamm and Gristle stood their ground, each of them grabbing ahold of one of his antlers. Despite his size and speed, Vothstag was brought to a dead stop.

He snorted and bellowed as he tried to force himself forward, but he was completely unable to overpower the two Clowns. Hamm and Gristle exchanged sinister smiles and began to spin Vothstag around and around. Within seconds his feet were off the ground, and with each rotation, he gained more and more momentum until his attackers finally let go of his antlers and sent him flying into the distance.

“The rest of you, stay out of our way!” Gristle shouted as he marched towards the front cart, grabbing me by the scruff of my jacket and pulling me along with him.

“Wait, why? Why can’t they come? Why can’t we all go?” I protested.

“We don’t know what half these freaks are and we don’t trust them,” he said as he tossed me onto the cart. “Now drive. Go straight until I say otherwise.”

I looked out at my confused and frightened companions, and took a bit of solace in the fact that they weren’t entirely certain if I had betrayed them or if I was just being kidnapped. I hesitated for a moment, but Hamm’s sharp talons digging into my shoulder were enough to press me into action.

With my coin of Seelie Silver clutched in my right palm, I grabbed a firm hold of the driving shaft and pushed the train forward. It accelerated at a remarkable pace, and before I knew it, we were speeding away from our work site and towards freedom.

“It’s working. It’s actually working,” Gristle laughed in relief.

“Even Vothstag can’t run this fast!” Hamm declared triumphantly. “The whole haul is ours! We’re rich! We’re free!”

I wanted to celebrate with them. I really did. But deep down inside I knew we weren’t out of the woods yet.

“You guys read that dossier Iggy gave us, right?” I asked. “The Naught Things that gnaw the Taproots are attracted to ontological anchors – anything that’s more real than its surroundings. If you guys are reality benders, and you just ate a massive power-up, doesn’t that make you the realest things here?”

“Isn’t that cute? He thinks he knows more about ontodynamics than us because he read a dossier,” Hamm scoffed.

“This isn’t our first time on the fringes of the unreal, boy!” Gristle replied. “You just drive this train, and let us worry about –”

Without warning, the Taproot split open ahead of us into a fuming, festering chasm. The ground quake was enough to completely derail the train, and I ducked and rolled while I had the chance.

When I came out of the roll, I looked up to see a titanic, disfigured, and disembodied head rising out of the chasm. The size and proportions of the entity fluctuated wildly, as if I was only looking at the three-dimensional facets of it like the World Tree itself. It was encrusted with some kind of dark barnacles, and anything that wasn’t its face was covered in thousands of squirming and feathery tentacles of every conceivable length. It had no nose, but several mouths which chanted backwards-sounding words in synchronicity with each other, dropping rotting black teeth every time they opened and closed. 

There were six randomly spaced and variously sized eyeballs darting around independently of each other, each glowing with a sickly yellow light. I was paralyzed in fear, terrified that the Naught Thing would see me, but all six of its eyes soon locked onto Hamm and Gristle.

As it slowly ascended upwards like a hot air balloon, a pair of flickering tongues shot out of two of its mouths with predatory intent. The Clowns were scooped up like flies, screaming as they were whisked back into the Naught Thing’s cavernous maws. I don’t know much about Clowns or what they’re capable of, only that Hamm and Gristle never got a chance to test their mettle against this behemoth. A few chomps of its black teeth, and it was all over.

I sat there in silence, watching as the Naught Thing continued to drift away, never daring to assume that it had forgotten about me.

“Brandon!” I heard a voice call from the distance.

I was finally able to pull my eyes off the Naught Thing, and when I looked down the track, I saw the rest of my crew hurrying towards me.

Which included a very angry Vothstag.

Grabbing me by the jacket and lifting me off the ground, he roared furiously in my face, demanding answers.

“Easy, Vothstag, easy!” Vinson insisted. “They just grabbed the kid. It wasn’t his idea.”

Vothstag growled skeptically, eyeing the toppled train beside us. He knew it could have only been driven like that by Seelie magic, and I still had my lucky coin clutched tightly in my right hand.

“…Hamm must have picked my pocket when he was working alongside us,” Vinson suggested.

I knew he didn’t really think that. He knew exactly how many coins he had, and he knew he wasn’t missing any. I don’t know why he covered for me, but I owe him big.

“Serves him right, too. Bloody idiot,” he said with a sad shake of his head as he surveyed the wreckage. “Let this be a lesson for all of you if you ever think about stealing my Seelie Silver! That’s right, Fish and Chips, I’m looking at you!”

Vothstag howled again, clearly unconvinced.

“They took me as a driver so that they could stay focused on defending the train!” I claimed. “If I hadn’t jumped when I did, they may have stood a chance against that giant floating head! I saved our haul!”

Vothstag snorted in contempt, but set me back on my feet. I don’t think he believed me, really, but he knew that Ignazio wouldn’t hold him blameless in this little debacle either, so it was in all of our best interests not to cast aspersions on one another’s stories.

“Listen up, everybody! We’re two men down and we’ve got to get this rig back on the track before some other unspeakable abomination comes along, so get moving!” Vinson ordered.

For once, Vothstag was doing most of the work, using his might to set the carts back on the tracks, while the rest of us just picked up any sacks of sap that had come loose.

“What a bloody joke,” Loewald grumbled as he threw a sack onto a cart. “Down from nine to seven, any of us could still die at any minute, and for what? We mined sixteen tons, and what do we get?”

“Another day older,” I agreed, throwing another sack next to his. “But some days, that’s enough.”",2,1729650237.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

To make matters worse, he spilled coffee all over himself and then blamed it on me! I was shocked and didn’t know how to react. I excused myself to the restroom to gather my thoughts, and by the time I returned, he was still fuming about the coffee spill. I decided to cut the date short and left.

1g9zs9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1g9zs9j/sixteen_tons/,Sixteen Tons,"“What’s got you in such a sour mood, Brandon? It’s payday!” my veteran colleague Vinson asked as the rusty freight elevator noisily rattled its way up towards the penthouse suite.

For the past year or two – I’m honestly not sure how long it’s been, actually – I’ve been under contract for an otherworldly masked Lord who calls himself Ignazio di Incognauta. He’s not a demon, exactly. He’s closer to Fae, I think, but I don’t fully understand what he is. I never sought him out. He came to me. I asked him how he even knew who I was, and he slapped me across the face for my insolence.

I still signed up though. That’s how desperate I was. He doesn’t waste his time offering deals to people who can say no.

He sends me and the rest of my crew out on what I can best describe as odd jobs. Half the time – hell, most of the time – I’m not even sure exactly what it is we’re doing. Most of the crew have been around longer than I have, and some of them aren’t human, but they all seem to have a better idea of what’s going on than me.

Our foreman Vothstag is technically the one in charge, but he’s not all there in the head; the top of his cranium’s been removed and a good chunk of his brain’s been scooped out. He mostly just barks guttural nonsense that none of us really understand, but somehow compels us to do what we’re supposed to, even when we don’t know what that is. He’s a hulking hunchback with an overgrown beard who usually wears an elk skull to cover up the hole in his head. If he was ever human, I don’t think he is now.

Vinson is our *de facto* leader, however, since he’s more or less a normal guy that we can relate to. Aside from Vothstag, he’s been working for Ignazio the longest. I won’t bother describing what he looks like, since the rest of us wear gas masks on duty. They’re partially to protect us from environmental and workplace hazards, partially to conceal our identities, but mainly to bring us more easily under Ignazio’s control.

That was why were all wearing our masks on the elevator, incidentally. We were on our way to see the big boss, and our contracts made it very clear we were never to remove our masks in his presence.  

“Come on, Vinson. You know meetings with Iggy never go well,” I replied bluntly.

“Oh, it’s just bluster. You know that. He’s got to put the fear of God into us,” Vinson claimed. “If he wasn’t actually satisfied with our performance, we wouldn’t still be here.”

“No, Brandon’s right. Iggy wouldn’t have called all ten of us in just to hand us our scrip and call us lazy arses,” Loewald chimed in.

“There’s nine of us, now,” Klaus reminded him grimly.

“Right, sorry. Hard to keep track some days,” Loewald admitted. “Regardless; something’s up, and the odds are pretty slim it will be something we like.”

I cringed as Vothstag shouted some of his garbled nonsense back towards Loewald.

“Yes, I know we’re not being paid to have fun, but –”

“We’re not being paid at all!” Klaus interrupted. “None of us are getting any real money until our contracts are up, and have any of you actually known anyone who made it to the end of their contract?” 

He recoiled as Vothstag spun around and began roaring at him, hot spittle flying out from beneath his mask of carved bone as he furiously waved his fist in his face.

“He’s right, Klaus. You’re being paranoid,” Vinson said in an eerily calm tone. “I’ve served out multiple contracts, and I’ve got the silver to prove it.”

He confidently reached into his pocket and held a troy-ounce coin of Seelie Silver between his fingers. Fish and Chips, the pair of three-foot-tall… *somethings* that work for us immediately crowded around him and began eyeing it greedily.

“That’s right boys, take a gander. That’s powerful magic right there, and you’ll get one of these for every moon you’ve worked at the end of your contracts,” he reminded us before quickly pocketing the coin away again. “Unless, of course, you do something to get your contract prematurely terminated; then you’ll have nothing to show for it but a fistful of expired scrip! So keep your heads down, mouths shut, and your eyes on the prize. You’ll have pockets jangling full of coins soon enough.”

As discreetly as I could, I slipped my hands into my pockets and rubbed my one Seelie coin for good luck. None of them knew I had it, because I didn’t want to explain how I got it, but that little bit of fortune it brought me had almost been enough to let me escape [once](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVespersBell/comments/yzlz7s/dont_shop_at_the_isomart_after_dark/).

If I could just muster up the skill to make the best use of my luck, it would be enough to get me out for good one day.

The freight elevator finally came to a stop, and the doors creaked open to reveal the spacious and sumptuous penthouse of our employer. Portraits, animal heads, shields, weapons, and most of all masquerade masks covered nearly every square inch of the walls. Amidst the suits of armour and porcelain vases, there were dozens of priceless ornaments strewn throughout the room. They were incredibly tempting to steal, which was their whole point. Stealing from the boss was a violation of your contract, and you did not want to break your contract.  

The wide windows on the far wall offered a panoramic view of our decaying company town, nestled in a valley between sharp crimson mountains beneath a xanthous sky twinkling with a thousand black stars. You may have heard of such a place before, it has many names, but I will speak none of them here. 

Ignazio was sitting on a reclining couch in front of the fireplace, some paperwork left out on the coffee table and a featureless mask like a silver spiderweb clutched in his hand. Ignazio himself always wore the top half of a golden Oni mask, which in and of itself wasn’t unusual for our company, but the odd thing was that several portraits in the penthouse showed that it had once been a full mask.

I’ve always wondered what happened to the bottom half.  

Aside from that, Ignazio wasn’t too unusual looking. He was tall, skinny, and swarthy with a pronounced chin, tousled dark brown hair and always dressed in doublets of silk and velvet like he was performing Shakespeare or something.

Vothstag went into the room first, with Vinson almost, but not quite, at his side. Fish and Chips scamped after them, followed by Loewald, Klaus, and myself.

The last two members of our crew are called Hamm and Gristle, and they’re the two I know the least about. They keep to themselves, and I don’t think I’ve ever even seen them with their masks off. I have seen them without gloves on though, and both of their hands are white with pink-tinged fingers. I have no idea what that means, but for some reason, I always found it oddly unsettling.

The only thing I know for sure about them is that they’re the only survivors of another crew that tried to run out on their contract, and I know better than to ask for details about that.

“Gentlemen, Gentlemen, right on time,” Ignazio greeted us as he waved us over. He positioned himself on his couch to make it impossible for any of us to sit beside him, and none of us dared to take a seat at any of the clawfooted armchairs that were meant for guests with much higher stations in life. “I’ve got this moon’s scrip books all stamped and approved. You’ll notice they’re a bit light, seeing as how you were slightly behind quota on this assignment.”

None of us objected, and none of us were particularly surprised. I was grateful that the mask hid my expression, and I’m sure I wasn’t the only one. I still had to make an effort to mind my body language though. Being so accustomed to his employees and compatriots wearing masks, Ignazio was quite astute to body language.

Vinson accepted the stack of nine booklets and nodded gratefully.

“We appreciate your leniency, my lord, and look forward to earning back our privileges on our next assignment,” he said.

“I was hoping you’d say that,” Ignazio grinned as he took a sip from his crystal chalice. He set it down on the coffee table and picked up a dossier. “Halloween is fast approaching, and that means we need costumes and candy. Costumes we have in abundance, obviously, but candy’s one vice I don’t usually keep well stocked.”

“So we’re actually stealing candy from babies on our next job?” Klaus asked.

“Nothing so quotidian,” Ignazio sneered. “Remind me; have any of you met Icky before?”

The name meant nothing to me, but I glanced from side to side to see if anyone else reacted to it. I could have sworn I saw Hamm and Gristle perk their heads up slightly.

“She’s that Clown woman, right? The one in charge of that god-awful circus?” Vinson asked.

“I beg your pardon? It’s an enchanted Circus that travels the worlds and offers sanctuary to paranormal vagabonds in need,” Ignazio claimed half-heartedly. “And I might be able to pawn a few of you off on them if it comes to that, so be careful you don’t fall any further behind on your quotas. But you’re right; she is a Clown, with a capital C, and Clowns love candy. She’ll be attending my All Hallows’ Ball this year, and I don’t want her to feel excluded, so we’ll need some real top-shelf candy on offer.”

“Ah… we’re still waiting for the other shoe to drop here, boss,” Vinson confessed as most of us shared nervous glances with one another. “You want us to get candy? Fancy candy? I… I don’t get it. What’s the catch?”   

“Oh god, we’re not taking it from babies: we’re serving the babies with it!” Loewald balked in horror.

“No, but thank you for that highball to make the actual assignment seem more reasonable,” Ignazio said. “No, I’m sending you all down to the Taproots of the World Tree to collect some of the crystalized sap there.”

“The… The Taproots of the World Tree?” Vinson repeated softly. “The physical manifestation of the metaphysical network that binds all the worlds and planes of Creation, gnawed at by the Naught Things trying to break their way into reality? You’re sending us down there… for sweets?”

“Icky swears that Yggdrasil syrup pairs beautifully with French Toast,” he replied blithely. “This is an especially dangerous assignment, so I want you all to read that dossier in full. Emrys has been charting and forging new pathways through the planes from his spire in Adderwood, so thanks to him your trip down at least will be relatively easy.”

“Just… just there and back, right?” Vinson asked desperately, his voice wavering. “Just a handful of the stuff to wow Icky, and we’re done, right?”

A sadistic smirk slowly spread across Ignazio’s face before he told us how much crystalized sap we would need to retrieve.

\*\*\*

“You mine sixteen tons, what do you get? Another day older, and deeper in debt,” Loebald sang as he chipped away at the pulsing amber crystal emerging from the leviathan root.

The World Tree was cosmically colossal, though it’s meaningless to describe its size since I can only describe the parts of it that exist in three dimensions. The twin trunks of the tree snaked around each other like a double helix, each alight with an ever-shifting astral aura that perpetually waxed and waned in synchronicity with its twin. From its crown sprung a seemingly infinite mass of fractally dividing branches, shimmering with countless spherical ‘leaves’ which I knew to be individual universes. The base of the tree spawned an equally infinite mass of sprawling taproots, anchoring it in place and drawing precious sustenance from the edges of reality.  

As dangerous as it was to be there, it was nonetheless a sublime experience. You think that looking upon all of existence like that would fill you with Lovecraftian madness at your own insignificance, but it was far more transcendental than that. On some fundamental level, I recognized that tree. It was Yggdrasil. It was the Biblical tree of Good and Evil. It was the Two Trees of Valinor. That tree was meant to be there, and so was everything inside of it. Sure, it was functionally infinite and everything in it was finite, but the tree wasn’t merely massive; it was intricate. In the grand scheme of things, nothing inside of it was superfluous. Everything, no matter its scale, was part of the ultimate design of the tree. You and I may not be any more important than anyone or anything else, but if we weren’t important, we wouldn’t be here.

I’m not entirely sure if any of my coworkers felt the same way though.

“Saint Peter don’t you call me, ’cause I can’t go,” Loebald continued to sing, only to be interrupted by Vothstag’s irate howling, his eyes burning like coals as he dared him to finish the chorus.

Loebald bowed his head contritely as he awkwardly cleared his throat. When Vothstag was satisfied he had been cowed into silence, he turned around to resume his work.

“’Cause I owe my soul to the company store,” I finished for him, not too loudly, but loud enough that everyone heard me.

Vothstag immediately came charging at me, roaring in fury, but I didn’t flinch. I just let him chew me out for about a minute until I heard something that I was pretty sure was a question.

“That’s ridiculous. You’re making more noise than either of us,” I countered. “And wasting more time. Now if you don’t mind, I’ve got work to do.”

Vothstag sneered at me, but since I had resumed my task, his job as taskmaster was complete, and he left to attend to other matters.

“What the hell are you doing, pushing your luck like that, Brandon?” Vinson whispered.

“He was out of line. Even chain gangs are allowed to sing,” I explained. “Besides, I’m right, aren’t I? If we attract any unwanted attention, it will be because of him.”

“This isn’t the place to cause trouble!” he hissed. “Fill the carts as fast as you can so we can get out of here!”

When we arrived at the Taproots, we saw that we weren’t the first beings to try to mine this deposit of sap. Someone, likely some clan of Unseelie Fae, had established a fairly complex operation with rails and hand carts. As convenient as this was for us, it did of course pose the uncomfortable question of why the site had been completely abandoned when it was obviously far from depleted.

Me, Vinson, Loebald, and Klaus were chipping away at the crystal sap, tossing what we could into a nearby trolley cart. When it was full, Hamm and Gristle would haul it off so that Fish and Chips could scoop it into twenty-kilogram bags, which Hamm and Gristle would then stack and secure onto skids.

And as always, Vothstag supervised.

“Sixteen bleedin’ tons of this bilge,” Vinson muttered as he took a swing at it with his pickaxe. “And he’s got the nerve to tell us it’s just an appetizer for a party guest. What do you suppose they’re going to do with it all.”

“Refine it into proper syrup, I imagine,” Loewald replied. “Make it into sweets and sodas, or just drizzle some of it straight onto flapjacks. Either way, they’ll make a killing. Sixteen tons will probably sell for millions.”

“Why though? Is it just exotic sugar?” I asked.

“What do you think?” Loewald asked rhetorically, gesturing at the source. “For reality benders, anything from the edges of reality is potent stuff. They put a lump of this in their morning coffee, and the Veil will seem as weak to them as it is here. There’s no telling what havoc they’ll get up to, so you better hope we’re not around to see.”

“Now you’re just being ridiculous. Clowns don’t drink coffee,” Vinson joked.

I was about to ask him how he would know, when Vothstag put his hand on my shoulder and spun me around. Hamm and Gristle had returned with the empty cart, but only Gristle was getting ready to pull the full one. Vothstag spewed some of his usual gibberish, gesturing at me and then towards Hamm’s empty space at the cart.

“Because I sang one line? Seriously?” I asked. I was about to throw Loewald under the bus for singing in the first place, but Vothstag was already roaring incomprehensibly. “Alright, alright. I’ll pull the damn cart.”

I handed my pickaxe over to Hamm, who instantly began swinging at the sap with manic enthusiasm. Gristle gave me a slight nod of condolence before Vothstag yoked me up to the cart like an ox and then sent us on our way with an angry shout.

“If you don’t mind me asking, how come Hamm deserves a break and you don’t?” I asked Gristle as we made our way down the track, the dinging of our colleague’s pickaxes slowly fading into the background.

Gristle looked over his shoulder to confirm the Vothstag was well out of earshot, and then turned his head towards mine.

“Vinson’s wrong, you know,” he said in a soft, conspiratorial whisper.

“Ah… I’m story?” I asked.

“About Clowns and coffee,” he clarified. “Icky drinks coffee. I’ve seen her do it. She takes it with double cream and sugar to keep it Clown Kosher, of course. She’s a little too classy to indulge in stereotypical candy binges, but she’s still got a sweet tooth like the rest of us.”

“…Us?” I asked uneasily.

Gristle nodded, lifting up his gas mask by the filter and revealing his face to me for the first time. His poreless skin was a lustrous white, but his lips, nose, and the space around his eyes were all pitch black, and the eyes themselves sparkled with the light of a thousand dying stars. His mouth was spread into an unnaturally wide smile, revealing that his teeth were not only perfect but shiny to the point that I could see myself in them.

And I looked terrified.

“Loewald was right though, about what this stuff will do to us,” he went on. “Once everything’s fully loaded, Hamm and I are going to take a mouthful each and then take the whole haul for ourselves. We’ll stash some of it away somewhere safe, then use the rest to buy our way back into the Circus. The only problem is getting there. That’s where you come in.”

“What are you on about? How can I possibly help you get back to your Circus?” I asked.

“With that Seelie coin you got in your pocket,” he said, lowering his voice so that I only barely heard him. “These carts weren’t meant to be powered manually, you know. They run on Faerie magic, and that coin’s got enough that we can drive all sixteen tons of our loot to anywhere in the worlds we want.”

I briefly considered denying that I even had the coin, but if he was determined, he could find and take it easily enough, so there really wasn’t any point.

“Ignoring for the moment how you even know I have that, why not ask Vinson?” I suggested. “He’s got way more Seelie Silver than I do.”

“He doesn’t want out. You do,” Gristle responded. “You tried to escape once, and I know you’re just itching for a chance to try again.”

“But… Ignazio knows what you are, doesn’t he? He wouldn’t have let you around the sap if he wasn’t prepared for you to try to take some,” I said.

“He doesn’t know Hamm and I can take our masks off without his say-so,” Gristle explained. “We’ve been living off meagre rations of powdered milk to keep us in line, but we were able to get a hold of a bottle of the fresh stuff and chugged it before we came here. Ignazio and Vothstag have no power over us right now.”

“… I’m sorry, milk?” I asked confused.

“Not important at the moment. Are you in or not?” he asked.

I considered his proposition for a moment, deciding on one final question before answering.    

“Why not just take the coin from me?”

“Because I’m a nice guy,” he said with a sickeningly wide grin. “And… stealing Seelie Silver tends not to end well. I don’t need an answer now. The load’s not full yet. Think about it, and when the time comes, do whatever you’ve got to do.”

He pulled his mask back down, and we finished hauling the cart over to Fish and Chips in silence.

He wasn’t wrong about me wanting to escape, but my plan had always been to quietly sneak off and be long gone before anyone noticed. A fight between Vothstag and a pair of superpowered Clowns followed by a daring getaway on an Unseelie mining cart was a bit riskier than anything I had envisioned. But at the same time, this was an unprecedented opportunity that would likely never come again.  From the Taproots of the World Tree, I could go literally anywhere, and never have to worry about Ignazio or his minions tracking me down.

All it would cost me was the single coin I had to my name.

I hauled the cart with Gristle for the rest of the shift. Eventually, we had a train of sixteen pallets, each loaded with fifty twenty-kilogram sacks of crystalized sap.

“That’s it then. Order’s full,” Vinson declared as he walked the length of the train, testing the chains to make sure the cargo was fully secured. “All of you hop in the front and let’s get the hell out of here.”

Vothstag roared in disagreement, standing between us and the cart and making a vaguely groping gesture.

“Right, right. Contraband check,” Vinson nodded with a weary sigh as he outstretched his arms. “Nothing too invasive now, you hear? If this stuff was inside of us, you’d already know it.”

Vothstag didn’t acknowledge his comment, but proceeded to pat him down and empty his pockets.

Hamm and Gristle each gave me a knowing look. If I did nothing, Vothstag would find my coin and it would all be over for me anyway. I nodded my assent, and braced myself for the worse.

With a single swift motion, Hamm and Gristle each pulled their masks off, and the visages of the two monstrous Clowns were enough to throw all of us into immediate pandemonium. Hamm’s hair, eyes, lips and nose were all a fiery red, and I saw now that the tips of their ears had a pink tinge, just like their fingers. The instant their masks were off, they wasted no time shovelling a handful of crystal sap into their mouths.

Vothstag howled and charged straight at them, and everyone else scattered as quickly as they could to avoid being bulldozed by the massive deer man. Hamm and Gristle stood their ground, each of them grabbing ahold of one of his antlers. Despite his size and speed, Vothstag was brought to a dead stop.

He snorted and bellowed as he tried to force himself forward, but he was completely unable to overpower the two Clowns. Hamm and Gristle exchanged sinister smiles and began to spin Vothstag around and around. Within seconds his feet were off the ground, and with each rotation, he gained more and more momentum until his attackers finally let go of his antlers and sent him flying into the distance.

“The rest of you, stay out of our way!” Gristle shouted as he marched towards the front cart, grabbing me by the scruff of my jacket and pulling me along with him.

“Wait, why? Why can’t they come? Why can’t we all go?” I protested.

“We don’t know what half these freaks are and we don’t trust them,” he said as he tossed me onto the cart. “Now drive. Go straight until I say otherwise.”

I looked out at my confused and frightened companions, and took a bit of solace in the fact that they weren’t entirely certain if I had betrayed them or if I was just being kidnapped. I hesitated for a moment, but Hamm’s sharp talons digging into my shoulder were enough to press me into action.

With my coin of Seelie Silver clutched in my right palm, I grabbed a firm hold of the driving shaft and pushed the train forward. It accelerated at a remarkable pace, and before I knew it, we were speeding away from our work site and towards freedom.

“It’s working. It’s actually working,” Gristle laughed in relief.

“Even Vothstag can’t run this fast!” Hamm declared triumphantly. “The whole haul is ours! We’re rich! We’re free!”

I wanted to celebrate with them. I really did. But deep down inside I knew we weren’t out of the woods yet.

“You guys read that dossier Iggy gave us, right?” I asked. “The Naught Things that gnaw the Taproots are attracted to ontological anchors – anything that’s more real than its surroundings. If you guys are reality benders, and you just ate a massive power-up, doesn’t that make you the realest things here?”

“Isn’t that cute? He thinks he knows more about ontodynamics than us because he read a dossier,” Hamm scoffed.

“This isn’t our first time on the fringes of the unreal, boy!” Gristle replied. “You just drive this train, and let us worry about –”

Without warning, the Taproot split open ahead of us into a fuming, festering chasm. The ground quake was enough to completely derail the train, and I ducked and rolled while I had the chance.

When I came out of the roll, I looked up to see a titanic, disfigured, and disembodied head rising out of the chasm. The size and proportions of the entity fluctuated wildly, as if I was only looking at the three-dimensional facets of it like the World Tree itself. It was encrusted with some kind of dark barnacles, and anything that wasn’t its face was covered in thousands of squirming and feathery tentacles of every conceivable length. It had no nose, but several mouths which chanted backwards-sounding words in synchronicity with each other, dropping rotting black teeth every time they opened and closed. 

There were six randomly spaced and variously sized eyeballs darting around independently of each other, each glowing with a sickly yellow light. I was paralyzed in fear, terrified that the Naught Thing would see me, but all six of its eyes soon locked onto Hamm and Gristle.

As it slowly ascended upwards like a hot air balloon, a pair of flickering tongues shot out of two of its mouths with predatory intent. The Clowns were scooped up like flies, screaming as they were whisked back into the Naught Thing’s cavernous maws. I don’t know much about Clowns or what they’re capable of, only that Hamm and Gristle never got a chance to test their mettle against this behemoth. A few chomps of its black teeth, and it was all over.

I sat there in silence, watching as the Naught Thing continued to drift away, never daring to assume that it had forgotten about me.

“Brandon!” I heard a voice call from the distance.

I was finally able to pull my eyes off the Naught Thing, and when I looked down the track, I saw the rest of my crew hurrying towards me.

Which included a very angry Vothstag.

Grabbing me by the jacket and lifting me off the ground, he roared furiously in my face, demanding answers.

“Easy, Vothstag, easy!” Vinson insisted. “They just grabbed the kid. It wasn’t his idea.”

Vothstag growled skeptically, eyeing the toppled train beside us. He knew it could have only been driven like that by Seelie magic, and I still had my lucky coin clutched tightly in my right hand.

“…Hamm must have picked my pocket when he was working alongside us,” Vinson suggested.

I knew he didn’t really think that. He knew exactly how many coins he had, and he knew he wasn’t missing any. I don’t know why he covered for me, but I owe him big.

“Serves him right, too. Bloody idiot,” he said with a sad shake of his head as he surveyed the wreckage. “Let this be a lesson for all of you if you ever think about stealing my Seelie Silver! That’s right, Fish and Chips, I’m looking at you!”

Vothstag howled again, clearly unconvinced.

“They took me as a driver so that they could stay focused on defending the train!” I claimed. “If I hadn’t jumped when I did, they may have stood a chance against that giant floating head! I saved our haul!”

Vothstag snorted in contempt, but set me back on my feet. I don’t think he believed me, really, but he knew that Ignazio wouldn’t hold him blameless in this little debacle either, so it was in all of our best interests not to cast aspersions on one another’s stories.

“Listen up, everybody! We’re two men down and we’ve got to get this rig back on the track before some other unspeakable abomination comes along, so get moving!” Vinson ordered.

For once, Vothstag was doing most of the work, using his might to set the carts back on the tracks, while the rest of us just picked up any sacks of sap that had come loose.

“What a bloody joke,” Loewald grumbled as he threw a sack onto a cart. “Down from nine to seven, any of us could still die at any minute, and for what? We mined sixteen tons, and what do we get?”

“Another day older,” I agreed, throwing another sack next to his. “But some days, that’s enough.”",1,1729650098.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False
1g9zs4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofattraction/comments/1g9zs4r/it_finally_happened_to_me_after_two_years/,It finally happened to me after two years ,"Hello everyone, please excuse my bad English, it’s not my mother language. 

First of all I would like to thank everyone in this subreddit for sharing their experience with us, it’s been really helpful. 

My boyfriend and I have been both struggling financially due to some legal and inheritance issues, we have been suffering for two years, we couldn’t even go on coffee dates or pay for the electricity, our accounts got frozen due to some issues with the death of family members (I can’t give more details I wouldn’t want him to see this), specially during this last 8 months, our mental health was at rock bottom, every one of us has to remind the other to not delete our self. 

I for myself I’m huge believer in the law of attraction, since 2016 when I was a teenager and found the movie the secret, it changed my life, I’ve literally been able to manifest the impossible, I got a great internship in the beginning of the pandemic without even applying for my first year in college abroad, and I got another one that paid for my degree the second year, my technique was to always visualise what I wanted and I would get it whithing the week, the last to years of my life I lost both of my parents, so it really messed me up, I couldn’t even get out of bed let alone find a job, I spent all my savings, and my boyfriend lost his company and got his accounts frozen because his business partner ran out of the country without paying the taxes of a very large sum. 

I’ve been trying every manifestation technique that I’ve came across these last years and nothing was working, it even got worse with every time I got a little bit of hope, till this Sunday it got to a point where I couldn’t take it anymore, I started crying, everything came up, the grief of both my parents, everything that I lost, the way my relationship was going, literally everything, I just started saying that I don’t want anything anymore, I don’t care about anything anymore, I’m just going to wait for the grim reaper in my room till my day comes, this morning my boyfriend called me to tell me that his lawyer called him, and that the issue with the taxes is sorted out, he still owes money but his accounts got unfrozen because the state has allowed him to get back to work for his to pay in instalments his part of the taxes that he owes, and that he can take a loan from the bank and get me a job inside of his company with the conditions that I want such as remote work because he knows that I’m to depressed to get out of the house, it’s been literally two years of us struggling financially but mostly mentally, we couldn’t do anything, we have not seen each other for 3 months and know we have already set a date for a civil ceremony to get married before the end of 2024. 

I know that it’s not a post that’s gonna excite everyone but I just wanted to share this with anyone that’s also struggling mentally because of how things are bad right now, and also I wanted to thank each and everyone whom I’ve had the pleasure to read these past months for giving me a moment of joy by sharing their stories ",3,1729650085.0,lawofattraction,0,1.0,False
1g9zra6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g9zra6/sixteen_tons/,Sixteen Tons,"“What’s got you in such a sour mood, Brandon? It’s payday!” my veteran colleague Vinson asked as the rusty freight elevator noisily rattled its way up towards the penthouse suite.

For the past year or two – I’m honestly not sure how long it’s been, actually – I’ve been under contract for an otherworldly masked Lord who calls himself Ignazio di Incognauta. He’s not a demon, exactly. He’s closer to Fae, I think, but I don’t fully understand what he is. I never sought him out. He came to me. I asked him how he even knew who I was, and he slapped me across the face for my insolence.

I still signed up though. That’s how desperate I was. He doesn’t waste his time offering deals to people who can say no.

He sends me and the rest of my crew out on what I can best describe as odd jobs. Half the time – hell, most of the time – I’m not even sure exactly what it is we’re doing. Most of the crew have been around longer than I have, and some of them aren’t human, but they all seem to have a better idea of what’s going on than me.

Our foreman Vothstag is technically the one in charge, but he’s not all there in the head; the top of his cranium’s been removed and a good chunk of his brain’s been scooped out. He mostly just barks guttural nonsense that none of us really understand, but somehow compels us to do what we’re supposed to, even when we don’t know what that is. He’s a hulking hunchback with an overgrown beard who usually wears an elk skull to cover up the hole in his head. If he was ever human, I don’t think he is now.

Vinson is our *de facto* leader, however, since he’s more or less a normal guy that we can relate to. Aside from Vothstag, he’s been working for Ignazio the longest. I won’t bother describing what he looks like, since the rest of us wear gas masks on duty. They’re partially to protect us from environmental and workplace hazards, partially to conceal our identities, but mainly to bring us more easily under Ignazio’s control.

That was why were all wearing our masks on the elevator, incidentally. We were on our way to see the big boss, and our contracts made it very clear we were never to remove our masks in his presence.  

“Come on, Vinson. You know meetings with Iggy never go well,” I replied bluntly.

“Oh, it’s just bluster. You know that. He’s got to put the fear of God into us,” Vinson claimed. “If he wasn’t actually satisfied with our performance, we wouldn’t still be here.”

“No, Brandon’s right. Iggy wouldn’t have called all ten of us in just to hand us our scrip and call us lazy arses,” Loewald chimed in.

“There’s nine of us, now,” Klaus reminded him grimly.

“Right, sorry. Hard to keep track some days,” Loewald admitted. “Regardless; something’s up, and the odds are pretty slim it will be something we like.”

I cringed as Vothstag shouted some of his garbled nonsense back towards Loewald.

“Yes, I know we’re not being paid to have fun, but –”

“We’re not being paid at all!” Klaus interrupted. “None of us are getting any real money until our contracts are up, and have any of you actually known anyone who made it to the end of their contract?” 

He recoiled as Vothstag spun around and began roaring at him, hot spittle flying out from beneath his mask of carved bone as he furiously waved his fist in his face.

“He’s right, Klaus. You’re being paranoid,” Vinson said in an eerily calm tone. “I’ve served out multiple contracts, and I’ve got the silver to prove it.”

He confidently reached into his pocket and held a troy-ounce coin of Seelie Silver between his fingers. Fish and Chips, the pair of three-foot-tall… *somethings* that work for us immediately crowded around him and began eyeing it greedily.

“That’s right boys, take a gander. That’s powerful magic right there, and you’ll get one of these for every moon you’ve worked at the end of your contracts,” he reminded us before quickly pocketing the coin away again. “Unless, of course, you do something to get your contract prematurely terminated; then you’ll have nothing to show for it but a fistful of expired scrip! So keep your heads down, mouths shut, and your eyes on the prize. You’ll have pockets jangling full of coins soon enough.”

As discreetly as I could, I slipped my hands into my pockets and rubbed my one Seelie coin for good luck. None of them knew I had it, because I didn’t want to explain how I got it, but that little bit of fortune it brought me had almost been enough to let me escape [once](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVespersBell/comments/yzlz7s/dont_shop_at_the_isomart_after_dark/).

If I could just muster up the skill to make the best use of my luck, it would be enough to get me out for good one day.

The freight elevator finally came to a stop, and the doors creaked open to reveal the spacious and sumptuous penthouse of our employer. Portraits, animal heads, shields, weapons, and most of all masquerade masks covered nearly every square inch of the walls. Amidst the suits of armour and porcelain vases, there were dozens of priceless ornaments strewn throughout the room. They were incredibly tempting to steal, which was their whole point. Stealing from the boss was a violation of your contract, and you did not want to break your contract.  

The wide windows on the far wall offered a panoramic view of our decaying company town, nestled in a valley between sharp crimson mountains beneath a xanthous sky twinkling with a thousand black stars. You may have heard of such a place before, it has many names, but I will speak none of them here. 

Ignazio was sitting on a reclining couch in front of the fireplace, some paperwork left out on the coffee table and a featureless mask like a silver spiderweb clutched in his hand. Ignazio himself always wore the top half of a golden Oni mask, which in and of itself wasn’t unusual for our company, but the odd thing was that several portraits in the penthouse showed that it had once been a full mask.

I’ve always wondered what happened to the bottom half.  

Aside from that, Ignazio wasn’t too unusual looking. He was tall, skinny, and swarthy with a pronounced chin, tousled dark brown hair and always dressed in doublets of silk and velvet like he was performing Shakespeare or something.

Vothstag went into the room first, with Vinson almost, but not quite, at his side. Fish and Chips scamped after them, followed by Loewald, Klaus, and myself.

The last two members of our crew are called Hamm and Gristle, and they’re the two I know the least about. They keep to themselves, and I don’t think I’ve ever even seen them with their masks off. I have seen them without gloves on though, and both of their hands are white with pink-tinged fingers. I have no idea what that means, but for some reason, I always found it oddly unsettling.

The only thing I know for sure about them is that they’re the only survivors of another crew that tried to run out on their contract, and I know better than to ask for details about that.

“Gentlemen, Gentlemen, right on time,” Ignazio greeted us as he waved us over. He positioned himself on his couch to make it impossible for any of us to sit beside him, and none of us dared to take a seat at any of the clawfooted armchairs that were meant for guests with much higher stations in life. “I’ve got this moon’s scrip books all stamped and approved. You’ll notice they’re a bit light, seeing as how you were slightly behind quota on this assignment.”

None of us objected, and none of us were particularly surprised. I was grateful that the mask hid my expression, and I’m sure I wasn’t the only one. I still had to make an effort to mind my body language though. Being so accustomed to his employees and compatriots wearing masks, Ignazio was quite astute to body language.

Vinson accepted the stack of nine booklets and nodded gratefully.

“We appreciate your leniency, my lord, and look forward to earning back our privileges on our next assignment,” he said.

“I was hoping you’d say that,” Ignazio grinned as he took a sip from his crystal chalice. He set it down on the coffee table and picked up a dossier. “Halloween is fast approaching, and that means we need costumes and candy. Costumes we have in abundance, obviously, but candy’s one vice I don’t usually keep well stocked.”

“So we’re actually stealing candy from babies on our next job?” Klaus asked.

“Nothing so quotidian,” Ignazio sneered. “Remind me; have any of you met Icky before?”

The name meant nothing to me, but I glanced from side to side to see if anyone else reacted to it. I could have sworn I saw Hamm and Gristle perk their heads up slightly.

“She’s that Clown woman, right? The one in charge of that god-awful circus?” Vinson asked.

“I beg your pardon? It’s an enchanted Circus that travels the worlds and offers sanctuary to paranormal vagabonds in need,” Ignazio claimed half-heartedly. “And I might be able to pawn a few of you off on them if it comes to that, so be careful you don’t fall any further behind on your quotas. But you’re right; she is a Clown, with a capital C, and Clowns love candy. She’ll be attending my All Hallows’ Ball this year, and I don’t want her to feel excluded, so we’ll need some real top-shelf candy on offer.”

“Ah… we’re still waiting for the other shoe to drop here, boss,” Vinson confessed as most of us shared nervous glances with one another. “You want us to get candy? Fancy candy? I… I don’t get it. What’s the catch?”   

“Oh god, we’re not taking it from babies: we’re serving the babies with it!” Loewald balked in horror.

“No, but thank you for that highball to make the actual assignment seem more reasonable,” Ignazio said. “No, I’m sending you all down to the Taproots of the World Tree to collect some of the crystalized sap there.”

“The… The Taproots of the World Tree?” Vinson repeated softly. “The physical manifestation of the metaphysical network that binds all the worlds and planes of Creation, gnawed at by the Naught Things trying to break their way into reality? You’re sending us down there… for sweets?”

“Icky swears that Yggdrasil syrup pairs beautifully with French Toast,” he replied blithely. “This is an especially dangerous assignment, so I want you all to read that dossier in full. Emrys has been charting and forging new pathways through the planes from his spire in Adderwood, so thanks to him your trip down at least will be relatively easy.”

“Just… just there and back, right?” Vinson asked desperately, his voice wavering. “Just a handful of the stuff to wow Icky, and we’re done, right?”

A sadistic smirk slowly spread across Ignazio’s face before he told us how much crystalized sap we would need to retrieve.

\*\*\*

“You mine sixteen tons, what do you get? Another day older, and deeper in debt,” Loebald sang as he chipped away at the pulsing amber crystal emerging from the leviathan root.

The World Tree was cosmically colossal, though it’s meaningless to describe its size since I can only describe the parts of it that exist in three dimensions. The twin trunks of the tree snaked around each other like a double helix, each alight with an ever-shifting astral aura that perpetually waxed and waned in synchronicity with its twin. From its crown sprung a seemingly infinite mass of fractally dividing branches, shimmering with countless spherical ‘leaves’ which I knew to be individual universes. The base of the tree spawned an equally infinite mass of sprawling taproots, anchoring it in place and drawing precious sustenance from the edges of reality.  

As dangerous as it was to be there, it was nonetheless a sublime experience. You think that looking upon all of existence like that would fill you with Lovecraftian madness at your own insignificance, but it was far more transcendental than that. On some fundamental level, I recognized that tree. It was Yggdrasil. It was the Biblical tree of Good and Evil. It was the Two Trees of Valinor. That tree was meant to be there, and so was everything inside of it. Sure, it was functionally infinite and everything in it was finite, but the tree wasn’t merely massive; it was intricate. In the grand scheme of things, nothing inside of it was superfluous. Everything, no matter its scale, was part of the ultimate design of the tree. You and I may not be any more important than anyone or anything else, but if we weren’t important, we wouldn’t be here.

I’m not entirely sure if any of my coworkers felt the same way though.

“Saint Peter don’t you call me, ’cause I can’t go,” Loebald continued to sing, only to be interrupted by Vothstag’s irate howling, his eyes burning like coals as he dared him to finish the chorus.

Loebald bowed his head contritely as he awkwardly cleared his throat. When Vothstag was satisfied he had been cowed into silence, he turned around to resume his work.

“’Cause I owe my soul to the company store,” I finished for him, not too loudly, but loud enough that everyone heard me.

Vothstag immediately came charging at me, roaring in fury, but I didn’t flinch. I just let him chew me out for about a minute until I heard something that I was pretty sure was a question.

“That’s ridiculous. You’re making more noise than either of us,” I countered. “And wasting more time. Now if you don’t mind, I’ve got work to do.”

Vothstag sneered at me, but since I had resumed my task, his job as taskmaster was complete, and he left to attend to other matters.

“What the hell are you doing, pushing your luck like that, Brandon?” Vinson whispered.

“He was out of line. Even chain gangs are allowed to sing,” I explained. “Besides, I’m right, aren’t I? If we attract any unwanted attention, it will be because of him.”

“This isn’t the place to cause trouble!” he hissed. “Fill the carts as fast as you can so we can get out of here!”

When we arrived at the Taproots, we saw that we weren’t the first beings to try to mine this deposit of sap. Someone, likely some clan of Unseelie Fae, had established a fairly complex operation with rails and hand carts. As convenient as this was for us, it did of course pose the uncomfortable question of why the site had been completely abandoned when it was obviously far from depleted.

Me, Vinson, Loebald, and Klaus were chipping away at the crystal sap, tossing what we could into a nearby trolley cart. When it was full, Hamm and Gristle would haul it off so that Fish and Chips could scoop it into twenty-kilogram bags, which Hamm and Gristle would then stack and secure onto skids.

And as always, Vothstag supervised.

“Sixteen bleedin’ tons of this bilge,” Vinson muttered as he took a swing at it with his pickaxe. “And he’s got the nerve to tell us it’s just an appetizer for a party guest. What do you suppose they’re going to do with it all.”

“Refine it into proper syrup, I imagine,” Loewald replied. “Make it into sweets and sodas, or just drizzle some of it straight onto flapjacks. Either way, they’ll make a killing. Sixteen tons will probably sell for millions.”

“Why though? Is it just exotic sugar?” I asked.

“What do you think?” Loewald asked rhetorically, gesturing at the source. “For reality benders, anything from the edges of reality is potent stuff. They put a lump of this in their morning coffee, and the Veil will seem as weak to them as it is here. There’s no telling what havoc they’ll get up to, so you better hope we’re not around to see.”

“Now you’re just being ridiculous. Clowns don’t drink coffee,” Vinson joked.

I was about to ask him how he would know, when Vothstag put his hand on my shoulder and spun me around. Hamm and Gristle had returned with the empty cart, but only Gristle was getting ready to pull the full one. Vothstag spewed some of his usual gibberish, gesturing at me and then towards Hamm’s empty space at the cart.

“Because I sang one line? Seriously?” I asked. I was about to throw Loewald under the bus for singing in the first place, but Vothstag was already roaring incomprehensibly. “Alright, alright. I’ll pull the damn cart.”

I handed my pickaxe over to Hamm, who instantly began swinging at the sap with manic enthusiasm. Gristle gave me a slight nod of condolence before Vothstag yoked me up to the cart like an ox and then sent us on our way with an angry shout.

“If you don’t mind me asking, how come Hamm deserves a break and you don’t?” I asked Gristle as we made our way down the track, the dinging of our colleague’s pickaxes slowly fading into the background.

Gristle looked over his shoulder to confirm the Vothstag was well out of earshot, and then turned his head towards mine.

“Vinson’s wrong, you know,” he said in a soft, conspiratorial whisper.

“Ah… I’m story?” I asked.

“About Clowns and coffee,” he clarified. “Icky drinks coffee. I’ve seen her do it. She takes it with double cream and sugar to keep it Clown Kosher, of course. She’s a little too classy to indulge in stereotypical candy binges, but she’s still got a sweet tooth like the rest of us.”

“…Us?” I asked uneasily.

Gristle nodded, lifting up his gas mask by the filter and revealing his face to me for the first time. His poreless skin was a lustrous white, but his lips, nose, and the space around his eyes were all pitch black, and the eyes themselves sparkled with the light of a thousand dying stars. His mouth was spread into an unnaturally wide smile, revealing that his teeth were not only perfect but shiny to the point that I could see myself in them.

And I looked terrified.

“Loewald was right though, about what this stuff will do to us,” he went on. “Once everything’s fully loaded, Hamm and I are going to take a mouthful each and then take the whole haul for ourselves. We’ll stash some of it away somewhere safe, then use the rest to buy our way back into the Circus. The only problem is getting there. That’s where you come in.”

“What are you on about? How can I possibly help you get back to your Circus?” I asked.

“With that Seelie coin you got in your pocket,” he said, lowering his voice so that I only barely heard him. “These carts weren’t meant to be powered manually, you know. They run on Faerie magic, and that coin’s got enough that we can drive all sixteen tons of our loot to anywhere in the worlds we want.”

I briefly considered denying that I even had the coin, but if he was determined, he could find and take it easily enough, so there really wasn’t any point.

“Ignoring for the moment how you even know I have that, why not ask Vinson?” I suggested. “He’s got way more Seelie Silver than I do.”

“He doesn’t want out. You do,” Gristle responded. “You tried to escape once, and I know you’re just itching for a chance to try again.”

“But… Ignazio knows what you are, doesn’t he? He wouldn’t have let you around the sap if he wasn’t prepared for you to try to take some,” I said.

“He doesn’t know Hamm and I can take our masks off without his say-so,” Gristle explained. “We’ve been living off meagre rations of powdered milk to keep us in line, but we were able to get a hold of a bottle of the fresh stuff and chugged it before we came here. Ignazio and Vothstag have no power over us right now.”

“… I’m sorry, milk?” I asked confused.

“Not important at the moment. Are you in or not?” he asked.

I considered his proposition for a moment, deciding on one final question before answering.    

“Why not just take the coin from me?”

“Because I’m a nice guy,” he said with a sickeningly wide grin. “And… stealing Seelie Silver tends not to end well. I don’t need an answer now. The load’s not full yet. Think about it, and when the time comes, do whatever you’ve got to do.”

He pulled his mask back down, and we finished hauling the cart over to Fish and Chips in silence.

He wasn’t wrong about me wanting to escape, but my plan had always been to quietly sneak off and be long gone before anyone noticed. A fight between Vothstag and a pair of superpowered Clowns followed by a daring getaway on an Unseelie mining cart was a bit riskier than anything I had envisioned. But at the same time, this was an unprecedented opportunity that would likely never come again.  From the Taproots of the World Tree, I could go literally anywhere, and never have to worry about Ignazio or his minions tracking me down.

All it would cost me was the single coin I had to my name.

I hauled the cart with Gristle for the rest of the shift. Eventually, we had a train of sixteen pallets, each loaded with fifty twenty-kilogram sacks of crystalized sap.

“That’s it then. Order’s full,” Vinson declared as he walked the length of the train, testing the chains to make sure the cargo was fully secured. “All of you hop in the front and let’s get the hell out of here.”

Vothstag roared in disagreement, standing between us and the cart and making a vaguely groping gesture.

“Right, right. Contraband check,” Vinson nodded with a weary sigh as he outstretched his arms. “Nothing too invasive now, you hear? If this stuff was inside of us, you’d already know it.”

Vothstag didn’t acknowledge his comment, but proceeded to pat him down and empty his pockets.

Hamm and Gristle each gave me a knowing look. If I did nothing, Vothstag would find my coin and it would all be over for me anyway. I nodded my assent, and braced myself for the worse.

With a single swift motion, Hamm and Gristle each pulled their masks off, and the visages of the two monstrous Clowns were enough to throw all of us into immediate pandemonium. Hamm’s hair, eyes, lips and nose were all a fiery red, and I saw now that the tips of their ears had a pink tinge, just like their fingers. The instant their masks were off, they wasted no time shovelling a handful of crystal sap into their mouths.

Vothstag howled and charged straight at them, and everyone else scattered as quickly as they could to avoid being bulldozed by the massive deer man. Hamm and Gristle stood their ground, each of them grabbing ahold of one of his antlers. Despite his size and speed, Vothstag was brought to a dead stop.

He snorted and bellowed as he tried to force himself forward, but he was completely unable to overpower the two Clowns. Hamm and Gristle exchanged sinister smiles and began to spin Vothstag around and around. Within seconds his feet were off the ground, and with each rotation, he gained more and more momentum until his attackers finally let go of his antlers and sent him flying into the distance.

“The rest of you, stay out of our way!” Gristle shouted as he marched towards the front cart, grabbing me by the scruff of my jacket and pulling me along with him.

“Wait, why? Why can’t they come? Why can’t we all go?” I protested.

“We don’t know what half these freaks are and we don’t trust them,” he said as he tossed me onto the cart. “Now drive. Go straight until I say otherwise.”

I looked out at my confused and frightened companions, and took a bit of solace in the fact that they weren’t entirely certain if I had betrayed them or if I was just being kidnapped. I hesitated for a moment, but Hamm’s sharp talons digging into my shoulder were enough to press me into action.

With my coin of Seelie Silver clutched in my right palm, I grabbed a firm hold of the driving shaft and pushed the train forward. It accelerated at a remarkable pace, and before I knew it, we were speeding away from our work site and towards freedom.

“It’s working. It’s actually working,” Gristle laughed in relief.

“Even Vothstag can’t run this fast!” Hamm declared triumphantly. “The whole haul is ours! We’re rich! We’re free!”

I wanted to celebrate with them. I really did. But deep down inside I knew we weren’t out of the woods yet.

“You guys read that dossier Iggy gave us, right?” I asked. “The Naught Things that gnaw the Taproots are attracted to ontological anchors – anything that’s more real than its surroundings. If you guys are reality benders, and you just ate a massive power-up, doesn’t that make you the realest things here?”

“Isn’t that cute? He thinks he knows more about ontodynamics than us because he read a dossier,” Hamm scoffed.

“This isn’t our first time on the fringes of the unreal, boy!” Gristle replied. “You just drive this train, and let us worry about –”

Without warning, the Taproot split open ahead of us into a fuming, festering chasm. The ground quake was enough to completely derail the train, and I ducked and rolled while I had the chance.

When I came out of the roll, I looked up to see a titanic, disfigured, and disembodied head rising out of the chasm. The size and proportions of the entity fluctuated wildly, as if I was only looking at the three-dimensional facets of it like the World Tree itself. It was encrusted with some kind of dark barnacles, and anything that wasn’t its face was covered in thousands of squirming and feathery tentacles of every conceivable length. It had no nose, but several mouths which chanted backwards-sounding words in synchronicity with each other, dropping rotting black teeth every time they opened and closed. 

There were six randomly spaced and variously sized eyeballs darting around independently of each other, each glowing with a sickly yellow light. I was paralyzed in fear, terrified that the Naught Thing would see me, but all six of its eyes soon locked onto Hamm and Gristle.

As it slowly ascended upwards like a hot air balloon, a pair of flickering tongues shot out of two of its mouths with predatory intent. The Clowns were scooped up like flies, screaming as they were whisked back into the Naught Thing’s cavernous maws. I don’t know much about Clowns or what they’re capable of, only that Hamm and Gristle never got a chance to test their mettle against this behemoth. A few chomps of its black teeth, and it was all over.

I sat there in silence, watching as the Naught Thing continued to drift away, never daring to assume that it had forgotten about me.

“Brandon!” I heard a voice call from the distance.

I was finally able to pull my eyes off the Naught Thing, and when I looked down the track, I saw the rest of my crew hurrying towards me.

Which included a very angry Vothstag.

Grabbing me by the jacket and lifting me off the ground, he roared furiously in my face, demanding answers.

“Easy, Vothstag, easy!” Vinson insisted. “They just grabbed the kid. It wasn’t his idea.”

Vothstag growled skeptically, eyeing the toppled train beside us. He knew it could have only been driven like that by Seelie magic, and I still had my lucky coin clutched tightly in my right hand.

“…Hamm must have picked my pocket when he was working alongside us,” Vinson suggested.

I knew he didn’t really think that. He knew exactly how many coins he had, and he knew he wasn’t missing any. I don’t know why he covered for me, but I owe him big.

“Serves him right, too. Bloody idiot,” he said with a sad shake of his head as he surveyed the wreckage. “Let this be a lesson for all of you if you ever think about stealing my Seelie Silver! That’s right, Fish and Chips, I’m looking at you!”

Vothstag howled again, clearly unconvinced.

“They took me as a driver so that they could stay focused on defending the train!” I claimed. “If I hadn’t jumped when I did, they may have stood a chance against that giant floating head! I saved our haul!”

Vothstag snorted in contempt, but set me back on my feet. I don’t think he believed me, really, but he knew that Ignazio wouldn’t hold him blameless in this little debacle either, so it was in all of our best interests not to cast aspersions on one another’s stories.

“Listen up, everybody! We’re two men down and we’ve got to get this rig back on the track before some other unspeakable abomination comes along, so get moving!” Vinson ordered.

For once, Vothstag was doing most of the work, using his might to set the carts back on the tracks, while the rest of us just picked up any sacks of sap that had come loose.

“What a bloody joke,” Loewald grumbled as he threw a sack onto a cart. “Down from nine to seven, any of us could still die at any minute, and for what? We mined sixteen tons, and what do we get?”

“Another day older,” I agreed, throwing another sack next to his. “But some days, that’s enough.”",2,1729650009.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1g9zp9h,https://i.redd.it/7jxlyszz0fwd1.jpeg,Walmart/Target Pyramid Scheme Has Made it to Knoxville!,"I was just approached by a lady named “Tammy” who tried to get my boyfriend and I to join their pyramid scheme… Thank god for Tik Tok! As soon as she asked if we were in school I immediately knew… here’s how it went:

My boyfriend and I are looking at spaghetti sauces when this lady approaches us. She compliments our curly hair and asks what products we use. While I usually get compliments when I wear my hair down my hair was in a slick back bun from the past 3 nights and the gel was starting to flake, so I thought it was odd I got a compliment with my hair in a bun..? And my boyfriend’s hair was styled so I just assumed she wanted to include me in the compliment. The lady said she wasn’t sure what to use in her kids hair implying that it was a similar texture to ours (3a-3c as we’re both mixed) and she had locs. I told her we use Camille rose and As I am and said this Walmart carries both of those in the hair section. She then asked if we were in school and I said I was. First red flag 🚩went off for me because I had remembered a Tik tok from months ago where this happened to someone in target: https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP889wcXM/

Anyways she asked what major I was… ofc I had the perfect major for their pyramid scheme… marketing. She then began to ask what I wanted to do with that degree and if I enjoy my financial income atm. I said I wasn’t exactly sure what I wanted to do but I’ve been looking into it. She then tells us a story about how she’s a school teacher and she gets sick all the time by kids picking their nose and touching things and tried to relate it to marketing??? But failed. And she then was like I met these people who are financially free by 28 and quit their 9-5. Second red flag 🚩!! And went on about how she started her own e-commerce business because of them. 

She then asked if we were interested in e-commerce, my boyfriend had no idea about the pyramid scheme and thought the lady was being genuine so he was telling her how I have ran a business before and am very into entrepreneurship. I was just trying to end the conversation but she kept asking many questions and I am not the confrontational type or like to say no so I just continued with the conversation with small bland answers. She then said she’d love to go to dinner or get coffee with my boyfriend, myself, and her husband to become friends and connect. 3rd red flag 🚩 she looked 40-50 and we are very early 20s… and I remember on Tik Tok they invited the girl to dinner or coffee. 

Anyways she asks if learning e-commerce from them was something we’d be interested in and I was just like sure and gave her my number so the convo would be over. I thought about giving a wrong number but she was asking as if she was gonna shoot me the text right then and there so I was afraid of giving a fake one. After that she left and we were in Walmart for another hour and never saw her again. She sent me a text within 30-45 min of the conversation being over. I included the message. 

I forgot to add ** when the conversation was done I noticed her phone was propped up on top of her purse which had been facing us the entire time as if it might have been recording? Not sure why anyone would place it on top of a bag vertically but 🤷🏽‍♀️
She was a very sweet lady but if you haven’t heard of this before beware!!😁😁😁",1,1729649839.0,Knoxville,2,0.57,False

Spending 8 hours at work bantering and continuing over text afterwards. I enjoy every second I spend with them and have no one else nearby besides my mom. When the girls had a roommate who wanted to move out in June, I was really excited to move in and be able to see my two favorite people every day.


When I moved in things changed immediately. No more invites to eat/make coffee at work, no more hangouts, and no more texts except for updates on their dog or for favors. I respond quickly, my texts get answered slowly, sometimes just ignored. The couple times I tried to hangout in the living room while they watch tv, they just speak in another language and I might as well not be there. But then there are a handful of times over the 5 months where we talk like before and it seems like everything was in my head. But then I broke my arm 6 weeks ago and they never offered any help. I know it's not their responsibility, but fuck.


Recently they got a house and I took a room. I packed and cleaned my stuff from the apartment early and stayed with my mom until I could move in. They were slow to clean the apartment but assured me it would be done by the 30th before we move into the house on the 1st. I did not have a key to the house but they told me not to worry about the key because at least one of them would be home on the 1st. I text them that night (30th), asking if they finished cleaning just to be sure, got no text back so I assumed they finished and I showed up to the house the next day, only to find out they were cleaning the apartment still. So I had to lay out on the ground with my broken arm for 3 hours while I waited for them to arrive because all they said when they finally replied was that it was going to take a while.


I am finding out things on my own, like that I will have to share a bathroom if there's another roommate, that the washer and dryer weren't going to arrive for a week, etc. They never told me much about the house before we moved in. I left for a week and in that time it looks like they found another roommate, had a housewarming party, and planned an upcoming party (in Nov) with our coworkers. Also, before they had their housewarming party they asked me if I was going to be home over the weekend, I said ""no,"" and all they did was like that message lol. They never mentioned a single thing to me, I only learned about the party because there were still decorations up when I got back. I learned about the upcoming party through others at my first day back at work. Before their housewarming party they went in my room and also moved things around in my bathroom while I was gone. I have nothing to hide, I just think it would have been nice to say something. It feels weird that they would touch my belongings and go into my room without saying anything, because I would never do the same to them. In the times they've left laundry in the dryer for days for example, I have always asked them to get their things and I waited sometimes hours for them to finally take care of it. I never touched anything of theirs without asking for permission is what I'm trying to say.


I know they don't have an obligation to tell me anything, and it's their house their rules. I just thought we were friends, but I always feel left out of the loop. Things just happen and I am expected to figure it out on my own. Another thing... I get you can assume I'll be here for the party with our coworkers because I live here, but they could've told me too just to spark a quick conversation. I feel like they don't really want to talk to me, or care much. I tend to overthink things, so I wanted other perspectives. Maybe I am too sensitive.",0,1729649527.0,relationship_advice,1,0.5,False

He assumed the money I left on the rego paper was from mum taking out cash for it. 

He hasn’t once asked me how I get money, I think he pray that it isn’t sex.

he is a major conspiracist, ever since lockdown 2020, it’s brainwashed him. And he thinks we are the brainwashed ones lmao.

Anyway, I still get told what to do, it’s actually really messed up.

Parents had me and moved out at 19.

I’ve been sheltered all my life though. I really want to spread my wings, so hopefully I move out soon now I’m able to make more money than I’ve ever been able to.

So anyway, here’s the text, btw he is a manipulator, and he is a major narcissistic. It’s always about him.

And the worst part of everything is, it’s his way or no way, there’s no room for me to ever have a normal conversation with him f2f, everytime I try to reply to him in person he always takes it like I’m talking back, when I’m simply trying to have a conversation, but the thing is he always talks *at me, not to me*.

Ugh, I can go on forever, but everyone can hey. We all have issues.

many years ago, when he came home from work  and I asked how was work as you normally do he said why do you ask me that. So from that moment on I never asked him again.

Anyway going off topic.

The context for this is that he said he would change my oil if I got him coffee and wash our dog. Even though the dog was washed 2 weeks prior.

I also cleaned all day at home yesterday.

And our dogs leg has been limping for a while but my dad doesn’t agree with vets. Such an idiot. But it’s his dog and his rules.

Notice how he doesn’t ask how I am or anything about me? Makes me sad lowkey.

Okay here’s the convo 

**DAD**: Hey Salty
Have you bathed Turbo from when I asked you to ? 
Todays a nice warm day just saying 

**ME**: I’m going to the beach and he smells fine I smelt him today and mum said he didn’t need a bath anyways the bigger concern is his injured leg opposed to a shower 🚿 😊

**DAD**: Don’t agree to something your not going to do plus you made the agreement with me not mum
*new text* the mechanic can change your oil from now 

**ME**: Whoops thought it was one option the coffee or nitro didn’t know it was both and it doesn’t matter because mum puts the ointment on him so she knows when turbo needs to be washed ? and if he smells fine then what’s the issue 😂 bringing him inside the house when it’s been cleaned the same day without being brushed but do I say anything 😂 if you want i can pay you idc dad 🤑

**DAD**: Your problem has always been your attitude your are unwilling to change or listen to authority and that’s including me your dad.

1g9zh08,https://www.reddit.com/r/RogueTraderCRPG/comments/1g9zh08/on_my_first_playthrough_wanted_to_record_my/,"On my first playthrough, wanted to record my thoughts (Act 1&2 Spoilers)","Here are some major things that have stood out to me so far.   


**1. The Cassia romance seemed kind of dumb, right up until I realized it was peak.**   
  
Sure, I got her out of Eurac V without using the crystal (in a comedy of errors - I initially didn't see the option for it because I didn't scroll down, reloaded with some confusion after I retrieved her without it, used it, then reloaded AGAIN after I realized she'd be complaining about it). Sure, I was kind to her during extraction - she's literally going to be the most irreplaceable person on my ship, I didn't want to piss her off. But then my MC starts spitting game in, what, the second conversation aboard the ship? And she's into it? Seemed pretty gratuitous - especially since all of the in-game records were building up ""The Child"" as some kind of Lovecraftian horror that drove normies to insanity through mere proximity, only for Cassia to be a perfectly harmless expath. (That's, uh, the opposite of an empath. That's how grammar works, right?)

But after mulling it over, I thought of the situation from *her* perspective. She is the closest thing the WH40K universe has to a princess that locked away in a tower, whose day-to-day life resembled an Asian cram school student, and who the vast majority of humanity finds abhorrent - to the point of physically recoiling when they see her (you could easily imagine her being in the Carnival Barker's cage; no makeup needed). Hours, maybe minutes, away from being killed from her brother, until the closest thing the WH40K universe has to a Prince Charming (seriously - you're the heir of a dynasty) rolls up in his Ultra-Yacht. Prince Charming murks the evil brother, whisks her away from the crumbling tower, and takes the first opportunity he\* has to say how beautiful she is. IF ANYTHING, SHE SHOWS IMMENSE RESTRAINT. She still has the reputation of her family to consider, so she not-so-subtly (they even took the time to animate it!) drops the ""how to get into my panties"" checklist on the coffee table and specifically instructs him to read it. Chef's kiss. Peak fiction.  


**2. About that asterisk**

\* Yeah - it's inexcusable that the romanceable NPCs aren't all bi. Realism? What? *Realistically,* the MC should be able to roll up to any given locale and have their pick of paramours within minutes of setting foot out of the shuttle. The roster is *extremely* constrained considering the prestige of our character. The amount of resources it would take to make that roster completely player-sexual is negligible in the scope of the game's development. It's inexcusable that gay women and gay men who play this game each have exactly one valid love interest, especially given how specific and narrow the traits of those characters are. And yes, Argenta should be romanceable too. *Obviously.* Considering how fast and loose the very concept of a Rogue Trader plays with the 40K setting, it's really not much of a stretch. 

  
**3. Abelard got off easy**

I'm able to peek behind the curtain a little with this one, because I can hear the VO say ""pirates"" when the text says ""cultists."" It's clear that Act 1 had substantial revision partway through development. That said - my Seneschal dares to question MY DECISION to investigate discontent on the lower decks? I didn't like the way the ""antagonistic"" options were written - I would have been *righteously* in that dude's face giving him a dressing-down. ""Our erstwhile Master-of-Whispers solicited, armed, and orchestrated an armed uprising of malcontents under your very nose! WITH A BOX OF SCRAPS!!!"" 

""Do not dare, for one moment, to pretend your so-called system of oppressing first and asking questions never is an effective way of administrating the crew of MY SHIP - !!! - when it created the *perfect conditions* for the mutiny that killed MY FAMILY! WITH A BOX OF SCRAPS!!!"" Man, I'd have been up in his grill about it.  


**4. I had to choose; I chose justice for Fidelio**

I'll admit, I did resort to looking up exactly one part of the Repentance sidequest - namely, I *thought* I'd clicked on everyone in the gathering at least once to look them over, and realized I must've missed somebody after reading the next step online. Once I did, though, I *also* reloaded this one a couple times, because I was hoping I could give the inheritance to the granddaughter *and* slaughter all of the pirates. I could not. I chose the latter. At time of playing, either option awards 4 PF - from a lore perspective, the former would be a much greater asset in the long run, but if it makes no difference from an in-game mechanics perspective... I choose justice. And I choose to end Fidelio's suffering afterward. If she is now incapable of feeling joy, let her at least experience the closest catharsis to it, before being released from more than a decade of torment.

Tokyo locals (or visitors passing through), I’m a 35-year-old Canadian dude on a mission: to track down the best, grittiest yakitori spots in the city. If you’re all about that grilled, skewered goodness (who isn’t? It’s practically an art form), join me on a monthly quest for the perfect bite. Don’t worry—no moose here, just yakitori. 🐔🍢

📅 Next hunt: Saturday, October 26th at 4 PM!
What’s the plan?Once a month, we’ll hit up a different yakitori spot—because life’s too short to stick to just one place.
🍺 The (totally serious) rules:
* If it’s a dud, we finish a beer and move on.
* If it’s a winner, we settle in for another round—or three. No one likes a quitter.
Feeling adventurous? We might keep hopping around or end up somewhere singing Celine Dion before the night’s over. 🎶🍻

Why should you join?
1. I’m obsessed with yakitori, and soon you will be too.
2. I’m on a mission to find Tokyo’s hidden gems—think Indiana Jones, but with more beer and less running.
3. Because why not? Life’s too short for bad chicken.

The vibe?Super casual—talk about life in Japan, your favorite anime, or that one time you had an existential crisis after three drinks. Anything goes, from Tim Horton’s coffee to deep debates on whether maple syrup could beat yakitori sauce in a showdown. 🍯🍢

Looking for a small crew!I’m aiming for a group of around 4 people to keep things simple. These places aren’t massive, and squeezing into the cozier spots with a small group will make it a smoother (and tastier) experience. So if you’re up for some good company and down with the small-group vibe, this is for you.

Who’s in? 🌈Anyone and everyone. Bring your quirks, your favorite playlists, and maybe even your best hockey stats. LGBTQ+ friendly, and you don’t need to be Canadian. (But if you are, bonus points for Nickelback on the soundtrack.)

Let’s eat, drink, and try not to lose our cool when the yakitori slaps 🏒🍢",5,1729648797.0,tokyoirl,2,0.85,False

I have a kitten that will be turning 1 year old in two weeks. I would like to describe some things that are going on with him in order to get feedback and advice. He is healthy and neutered. It is just the two of us in a one-bedroom apartment.

He is a very, very energetic cat. I play with him several times a day, for probably 20 ish minutes at a time. I have every toy imaginable. He particularly likes to chase balls that I throw for him. A couple of months ago I also bought him a cat wheel, which he uses occasionally. We live in a small apartment so I have to get creative. I also give him plenty of love and attention. He gets pets and scratches constantly, and he loves being brushed.

He demands constant attention, whether it be to play or to beg for more food. He bites, scratches, and attacks my feet. He lunges at me. He also screams a lot. Not just meowing, full on screaming. We used to live with my ex, who played rough with him and allowed him to bite during play. This aggravated me to no end. It set a horrible precedent for my cat, who now doesn't know any better. He sees the biting and screaming as the best way to get my attention. I'm sure we all know, cat scratches and bites can hurt pretty darn bad. My legs are absolutely covered in scratches 24/7.

Two days ago it got so bad that I put him in the bedroom, closed the door, and called my dad in tears. Zu was attacking my feet non-stop. He was angry because I had started transitioning him to a different dry food (he eats both dry and wet food). Food is an issue here too: he is always hungry, and when I don't feed him more, he acts out aggressively. One failure on my part is that I have given into this behavior before, thus encouraging it. 

I think I have two main issues here: 1. I have let him dictate to me when he wants more food. That I can handle. 2) Most importantly, I think he is bored. He is still technically a kitten after all. He is a high-energy boy and I am wondering if I am doing him a disservice by having him be the only animal here. I work a fair amount so he is home alone often. I don't really want another cat, but I would get one for him if it would help him. I also know that he misses my ex. Those two really loved each other, and the cat loved playing with him. I think the cat tries to get me to play rough with him the way my ex used to. 

Despite everything I just said, he is a really good boy! He is absolutely hilarious. I love him so much, and I'll do anything I can for him. As I type this, he is sitting on the coffee table watching cat TV on youtube. ",2,1729648761.0,CatAdvice,0,1.0,False

To be honest, I'm not even sure she likes me? I know, obviously, that she loves me. But if I was a stranger, unrelated to her and we met at some coffee shop, she’d probably go home and be like “Wow that person sucks.” Ya know? 

We got into a fight today, but otherwise were doing alright. I was in her room with my sister and her child and they're trying to wrangle this five-year-old out and mom leans down, kisses said child on the cheek and says “Who’s grandmas favorite person?” 

Yeah, I kinda got jealous of a fiv-year-old. But I guess in that moment, even tho I know she only said it because of that fight. (She knows it upsets me, we've talked about.) It kinda clicked in my head that I'll just never be her favorite. I'm not the daughter she wanted. I'm nothing like her. And she wants me to be mini her- literally said herself that she only wanted a daughter so that she could have another her.

She likes to act like I'm her, that I have the same opinions and feels and she makes it very clear that she only sees me as an extension to her. I make it known that I'm not. I'm argumentative, I’ll yell back and stand up for myself. But otherwise, I'm a good kid? I stay in my room all day, so its kinda hard to not be good when I do nothing, lol. I get good grades, I do my chores, I keep my room clean. 

But no matter what, I just won't be her favorite. Even if I did everything she wanted, I wouldn't be her favorite. I don't think I'm anyones favorite really? Other then my dogs, so I think its alright if I'm not.

Sorry if this is all over the place, I just needed to get it off my chest and its not like I can tell her or really anyone around me. So reddits the next best thing I guess. Also sorry for grammar or spelling, mobile sucks ass and its late right now lol.",3,1729648656.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False

I was at the Stanford game and had an amazing experience, so I’m writing with some ideas. Above all, I was really impressed by how well the university managed to integrate its programming with a football weekend:

On Friday, we attended a talk—an “MVP lecture”—by a nationally celebrated writer, Lauren Groff. It was followed by a reception with coffee, wine, and snacks. That night, Condoleezza Rice spoke on campus and there was a classical music concert in DPAC. We didn’t attend those two events, but it’s definitely worth checking the schedule for DPAC when you’re in town. 

Saturday morning, we attended a “Saturday with the Saints” lecture. It was fabulous, and to our surprise, all attendees were given free ND T-Shirts. We went to an open house at the Museum of Biodiversity, where my son loved seeing all kinds of cool preserved animals. Then we got free lunch (with beers) at an open house sponsored by the Medieval Institute, which had also organized a sword-smithing demonstration. We also saw an archival exhibit in the library on ND history, including its clashes with the KKK. 

On top of all that stuff, we had more than enough time for all the normal things—visited the grotto, Sunday mass at the basilica, attended bagpipe and band concerts on God Quad, watched the player walk, etc. 

Just wanted to give some folks ideas for their campus visits.

1g9zauz,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/1g9zauz/mental_health_substance_abuse_and_parents_who/,"Mental Health, Substance Abuse, and Parents Who Thought Dissociation Was The Holy Spirit: My Story ","
TLDR: Unaddressed Religious Trauma triggered OCD which was exacerbated by alcoholism and an eating disorder. I lost my mind. My parents told me it was the Holy Spirit. I dissociated and reverted to a younger version of myself as a defense mechanism. My life is now in shambles, but I am doing my best to pick up the pieces and making good progress! 

As a preface here, I want to say that I am in no way just casting blame onto my family for some of my own actions I describe in this story. Part of my recovery has been learning and accepting that I have to take extreme ownership over my own life and my own mental health, and failing to do that put me in a bad spot. The thing that eats me alive though is this one simple question: Maybe, if my family weren’t so hyper-religious, like even just a little less than they are, some of the damage here could have been avoided, and they would have directed me to get the professional help I needed and am currently receiving? That’s kinda beside the point now though because I am where I am and I can’t change that. If I had a Time Machine though- I’d use it for sure. 

As you probably gathered from the title, I recently experienced a mental health episode. In January of this year, I began to have obsessive thoughts and nightmares about what’s going on in Israel- specifically about the current war in the region being the unfolding of what is discussed in the Book of Revelations. Out of nowhere, after having deconstructed my faith several years ago, I was having intrusive thoughts and dreams of needing to be back in church, coming back to the Lord, etc. because the end was near and I felt I was at risk of Hell. I didn’t tell anyone at the time because I was just trying to shake it off- this included not telling my girlfriend of two years and my closest friend and room mate. 

Before I go further, here is some background on me. I am a 27 year old male. I grew up in South Georgia. My father has been a non-denominational, conservative evangelical preacher as his sole vocation for my entire life. He started a very successful church in my hometown, Saint Simons Island, GA- where obviously I grew up attending with my family. I was always very involved, and can even say I had some great times in youth group doing fun stuff. Around the time I was in highschool, I started asking some of the harder questions about the more incredible, unreliable, weird, violent, confusing, and even contradictory parts of scripture. 

My questions were those types of questions that small group leaders, youth pastors, even my dad would just punt as far as they could by quoting a verse like “The ways of God are unknown to man” or “We walk by faith not by sight.” Those never satisfied me, so I became very interested in theology. I essentially went on a quest as a junior in highschool looking to solidify my faith,  and by the end of six years trying to answer questions that just can’t be answered, I was a college graduate who believed in intelligent design but wasn’t comfortable saying Jesus was divine, resurrected, part of a Godhead, etc. I no longer identified as Christian. 

I went to therapy about it, had multiple discussions with my family who were surprisingly accepting of my skepticism- however, their acceptance was always backed with a smug reply- more or less saying this: “we trust the plans the Lord has for you- if now is the time for you to learn the lessons of the prodigal son then it will just be part of your testimony.” 

I mean, seriously, they just couldn’t ever drop it. 

They were very passive in a lot of this, which was in a lot of ways more confusing for me as opposed to if they had been beating me over the head with an NIV study Bible every time I came home. I know many others have experiences like that. Anyways, back to what happened to me this year. 

From January onwards, things started to get worse in my life. I didn’t even realize how anxious and depressed the OCD and intrusive thoughts were causing me to feel, or even connecting the dots and realizing how much they were feeding into my increased desire to drink, smoke, isolate and withdraw. I was definitely in denial, and I think now that’s because I felt like I had already been to therapy about these things (addiction included) so they couldn’t possibly trouble me anymore to some great extent. I was just having a hard time, it was the winter and it’s seasonal, and I’m just taking the edge off- I’ll cutback when I get to feeling a little better. That’s what I was thinking. 

By Easter, I had actually started to feel a little better, but overall still troubled. I at least had cut back on substance abuse quite a lot though. I went home to my parents for the holiday weekend and I ended up sharing with them about some of the hard feelings I was having. I wasn’t explicit in discussing the compulsive thoughts about being damned, but just discussed with them the anxiety and depression I was experiencing. They had sensed some of it due to my lack of contact. 

I remember we had a long conversation that ended with them saying- “we really don’t know what to tell you. We deal with these things in a way that is more powerful than all the medicine in the world with Jesus.” And then my Dad said- “honestly, I think you’re going to continue having some of these same problems until you find your identity. And you may not know where that is right now, but I do. It’s in Jesus Christ and Christ alone.” 

We went to the church service the next day and after my dad finished preaching during the altar call, I was feeling particularly guilty and started to think- “maybe they’re right. Like maybe I need to give this another shot.” So I asked them to pray with me for Jesus to enter my heart again and save me from my sin. Ya know- the same sinner’s prayer all of us have probably prayed an inordinate amount of times in our lives. I told them that I was still hesitant, didn’t really believe, but that if God was real I’d give him a chance. 

Nothing really happened. I went home that night and was kinda laughing about it with my room mate and girlfriend as I told them what happened. We all shared stories about similar experiences and talked about how emotional those synth -pads coming out of $20,000 subwoofers right in front of you can make you feel during a worship service- especially when the man doing the altar call is none other than the man who raised you… a man that you do love even though you disagree with him… and more than that, a man you’ve always felt would never truly love you, accept you, or validate you without claiming a belief in Jesus and at least trying to “walk with the Lord” as they say in church. 

By the time June rolled around- my situation with my mental health took another downturn, I was drinking a lot- like 5/7 days a week, depression and anxiety had led to even more OCD, suicidal ideation, and a feeling of hopelessness. It had become so bad that I talked to my girlfriend and she said that she should have some space from me and I should do the same. I hated it, but even at the time I agreed. I couldn’t blame her, and I was tired of dragging her down with me. 

While this break was the right call and I can admit to my part in not taking ownership over own my mental health and well-being- Ut still broke my heart even more in the midst of my confusion. It was the right call, but I hated myself for putting myself in the situation where it was the right call. I felt all kinds of self-pity and shame. I love this girl to this day. I was planning on marrying her. We had discussed it. I had the wedding band. I freaked out. I felt like the world’s biggest loser and fool. 

I went back to my parents the same night we had that conversation, June 16th, and that’s when the religious heat got turned up. I was initially just headed up there for a time to get my head straight. I resisted the religious talk at first, but each time I wanted to talk about what to do it’s like they only had one thing to say “let’s pray together, let’s hear what the Lord has for you in this time.” 

Here’s where it gets nuts. On the morning of July 2nd, my parents asked me if I’d join them in a time of devotion and prayer. I reluctantly agreed thinking that I’d just be nice and didn’t have anything else to do that morning. But at the end of the devotion, my dad asked if I would try something called “deliverance and listening prayer” with him. 

It triggered something very weird inside of me. For those unfamiliar with this type of prayer, we were just silent for a while and then he would ask questions about things that were going on with me, the pain and inner conflict I felt, if I could see where God was in my pain from my past and my present, and each time I’d share about something painful- he’d say “God, what do you want to say to Jonathan (my name) in this?” 

The first three times he asked if I heard anything I said “no.” I said no because I didn’t. I started to feel bad though. As strange as it sounds, my dad never really tried to connect with me as a kid and in a very fucked up way I felt like I was letting him, our church, our family, and myself down by not “hearing from God” like they all said they did. I didn’t want to feel any more unconnected than we already did. In my heart of hearts, I myself wanted what we were doing to be real and to work!!

So the fourth time he asked I just started saying stuff and making it up. I grew up in charismatic Christian circles so I’ve always known the words to use, have a lot of scripture memorized still to this day that I can reference, and I consider myself pretty creative so I just kinda leaned into it. 

My parents started crying at some of the things I was saying. They were telling me that the Holy Spirit was giving me visions to heal me and show me that I no longer need to hide from Jesus and can come home. And then finally my dad said “Satan, come out right now in the name of Jesus.” By this point I was crying to, mostly because they were crying and also I had just finished describing one of my most painful and traumatic experiences from childhood because my Dad wanted “God” to show me that he was still with me during this time. I’ve always cried when I talk about that moment. But when my dad said “Satan, come out” I just kinda told him. “Oh that worked, I felt something bad leave me and feel peaceful right now.” 

I didn’t want my dad to think he’s not like, idk, faithful enough to command darkness or demons like that so I rolled with it. And truthfully, I did feel lighter because a good cry always does that. I was by no means exorcised though. That’s kinda where my family went with it. 

When it was all said and done, my family was so happy and for the first time in ages it felt like they weren’t walking on eggshells around me and that made me happy as well. I had felt estranged from my birth family my entire adult life and now they were finally validating me, telling me I was doing the right thing, that they were proud of me, that they were excited for my future. 

After two months of talk therapy walking back through what happened over and over with intense description of specific feelings, timelines, doing brain scans, and exposure therapy- my doctors have now come to suggest that what I experienced was a dissociative episode- in more specific terms: a novel fragmentation of my personality where my primary self was never fully unconscious, but was overwhelmingly  repressed. This happened as a defense mechanism from the intense anxiety, depression, and helplessness I was experiencing which was exacerbated to a point well beyond the threshold of functioning capacity by the other unhealthy coping habits I had formed in substance abuse and bulimia. 

Essentially, I felt shitty before my soon to be fiance wanted to take a break and I didn’t fully understand why. Then I felt abandoned and feelings got worse- unfortunately I couldn’t snap out of it long enough to think rationally even though I had been sober since the beginning of June (which, in my case, getting sober without detox made me mental health situation worse). Then, in a time of already monumentally heartbreaking and panic-inducing emotional distress, I was subjected to triggers of my own deep-rooted childhood religious trauma in trying to seek help from my parents. End Result: I went crazy, and lost my mind for a little while. In watching a few recordings of me from July-August, my doctors noted that my voice was different, my handwriting had changed during that time from comparing samples of my journal from then and now, my vocabulary and lexicon was not as complex, and even my interests changed. I started fishing again, which I did a lot in highschool. I HATE FISHING! I only ever did it  as a way to hang out with people. 

Ultimately, I reconstructed my faith in a mental crisis, and got baptized in a period of dissociation that lasted almost two months (a video of the baptism which I didn’t even know was taken went regionally viral). My girlfriend was very confused and she wouldn’t talk to me on the phone after she saw the video. She just texted and said “I’m happy for you that you’ve found some peace, but I feel like I don’t know you anymore. Let’s just call this.” I handled it well at first, but in mid-August- all the denial came crashing down one morning. IDK what happened, but one day I woke up, looked in the mirror, and was like “what the fuck is going on- why am I at my parents house? What have I done with my life? Why did I make these decisions- I didn’t really want to do any of this. I felt disgusting in my own skin, and still do today at times though that is improving. 

This wasn’t a full dissociation like you see in the movie Split or something. However, it was dissociation nonetheless. I’m not trying to recuse myself of taking responsibility for my own actions, but at this point the most responsible thing I can do is be realistic with myself and others and just admit that yeah- I lost it for a minute. I was not all there mentally. 

I told my parents that I was very concerned about my mental health after I had started to feel a little more normal again. I told them I didn’t really feel like I was in full control of myself for the last two months. 

They said it was because I had a “mountain top spiritual encounter with the Holy Spirit” and now that the initial high was over, coming back down would take some getting used to. I pushed back a little in this conversation- and my dad asked when I would stop acting like a fag—t, and “quit letting Satan make me his bitch.” I just felt hopeless, and I tried as long as I could to just go with the decisions that I had made. I just figured I’d lead a double life as long as I had to but then I’d just kinda get out again and put it behind me. That made things worse. 

I started drinking and smoking heavily again to cope (stupid, insane, I know). I was just terrified to tell my parents that I really had come to believe that I had gotten baptized in front of my dad’s own church as part of a mental episode. I mean other parents with young adult children who have left the church were literally asking me and my parents to pray for their kids and asking us for guidance.

Holding it in made things worse. I reached the point I couldn’t do it anymore at work after lunch one day. 

While unloading some supplies from the work van, I had a panic attack, started crying, and projectile vomited three times. Very strange experience. 0/10. Do not recommend. 

I quit the next day, and went to do rehab and therapy away from my parents. I am still here. Progress has been good, but I am lonely. 

My ex girlfriend will not speak to me- I think it’s sad I don’t even get the chance to explain, but ultimately I have accepted that because I truly do just want her to be happy and I know I just need to keep working on me right now. Besides her, most of the other people I really cared about aren’t entirely unwilling to be friends with me, but I mean they’re all apprehensive I can tell. They are very confused by what’s happened and I don’t blame them. I mean, they had a front row seat to me having a mental break. 

I can’t really talk to anyone now because my old friends are still like “whoa what the hell happened this summer” and I haven’t had any inkling of an answer until recently so there’s been nothing to say and I don’t even know who to trust. On the other hand, all the friends I made during my mental breakdown boy summer are all worried now that I’m “falling back into sin.” 

Now, I wake up at 6 am everyday, go to an AA meeting at 7, go to therapy after getting a smoothie at my favorite coffee shop, then I do neurofeedback treatments, I go to my part time job where I move furniture all day which I guess Im thankful for the exercise, and other than that I mostly just try to accept what the hell happened or spend time doing something where I don’t have to think about it since my mid morning is already entirely devoted to doing that lol. 

I had no idea how much growing up in such a religious family had an effect on me until recently. I am hopeful I will soon come to terms with it- but yeah, life sucks right now. 

Thanks for reading if you made it through this batshit crazy, lengthy story.

I guess I wonder if this is indicative of a greater trend in coffee. Like, hey, don't buy based on the roast level. Buy on the tasting notes and trust that the roaster is roasting correctly for the bean, regardless of the roast level.

Obviously this doesn't apply to all roasters. I guess I just find it a bit frustrating and confusing when I order and open yet another bag of medium roast coffee. Maybe it's a NZ thing.",2,1729648404.0,pourover,5,1.0,False

These are all vegan/gluten free, supplied to the coffee house by a company called Baked Brands, that specializes in vegan and gluten free baked goods.

On the PACT Coffee listing, it does mention the carry both regular baked goods, and vegan/gluten free, but I wasn't actually expecting to get gluten free, as both my sister and Mom have gotten surprise bags from them before, and they were all full of gluten! Lol. 

I'm not truly disappointed, but I was hoping for 1 of ""the best peanut butter cookies ever"" (according to my Mom). I do wish they'd actually put up a separate listing for gluten free though, as the 2 people I gave the missing items to are celiac, and they would love to be able to grab a box from here, but there's no way of knowing what you'll get.

Just wanted to share something that has made a big difference for me recently. I've long had a group of tasks that are extremely small and routine that have never felt like they merited their own tasks in my To-Do manager, but *are* significant, take up clutter in my head, and have a very high rate of me getting in bed and realizing ""oh damn, I forgot to..."" These are things like:

* making coffee for the next morning
* taking my lunch tupperware out of my backpack
* putting my cycling clothes in my laundry bin
* wiping down the kitchen counters
* loading the dishwasher

And so on. I never made these into individual tasks because they seemed insignificant, but I was routinely forgetting them. 

Enter: 

""Opening"" and ""Closing."" I'm now treating my house like it's a store, with an opening checklist and a closing checklist. This way, all of these little things happen in the ten or so minutes before I go to bed, and then in the morning, they help me keep on-track before I run out the door.

For example, I get up at 7 and try to be on my bicycle by 8. The ""Opening"" task pops up at 7:20, and goes:

* Breakfast
* Check for emails from students (I teach a 9:30 class and want to make sure I'm not missing anything before I see them)
* Lunch in backpack
* Check weather
* Put on sunscreen
* Fill travel mug
* Phone, wallet, keys, change of clothes (packed the previous night).

Now, instead of running around in the morning trying to remember if I've done everything, I just follow the list :) So much peace of mind, and I never forget anything!

These tasks have slight variations depending on the day (I only go to my office on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so the ""pack a change of clothes"" task only appears on the Monday/Wednesday version of ""Closing."")

This might seem really straightforward to some of you, but I've been Cortexing for... at least seven years?... and this just occurred to me a few weeks ago. It's worth trying for the peace of mind!",11,1729647713.0,Cortex,1,1.0,False

The following is my second entry in an ongoing series where I present the 100% factual and inarguable assessments of several of Fromville's happiest little citizens in an effort to effectively rate their respective quality as a Fromville survival partner. The process has been independently verified and is, as the title states, completely objective. The ratings are devoid of personal opinion and final. The overall rating is given as a BBR (Battle Buddy Rating) and the Series Survival Chance Percentage is given as the SSCP. Thank you for your consideration and minor spoilers below.

**All-Time BBR Ranking (with SSCP as a tiebreaker)**

1. Victor 5
2. Boyd 3.5
3. Trudy 3
4. Elgin 1

https://preview.redd.it/gzxycpgq6ewd1.jpg?width=699&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=870c3bb294a43e412bae63163ce9ba26aed1f94f

**Donna**

Donna is a woman of many simultaneously held contradictions. On one hand, she recognizes that the creatures aren't the scariest part of Fromville, it's the absolute idiots you have to spend your days with. On the other hand, she intentionally surrounds herself with dozens of them in a compound that has numerous single points of failure. On one hand, she's a sensible yet firm leader who established an emergency protocol that her housemates are well-versed in. On the other hand, she actively encourages a culture of binge-drinking and partying such that the safe and effective execution of said plan is nigh impossible and flavored with bootleg vodka. On one hand, she cares deeply for the residents of Fromville, and does her best to ensure a steady supply of food for everyone. On the other hand, she let my sweet baby angel Trudy get ripped to shreds by ""Leave it to Beaver"" side characters. Such is the nature of man.

I feel like every American has had Donna for 9th grade gym, and just like my 9th grade gym teacher Donna's ability to handle large quantities of grain alcohol are unrivaled (we know that wasn't coffee in your thermos, Mrs. Roberts). Also just like my 9th grade gym teacher, I wouldn't necessarily say I'm attracted to Donna, but let's just say if a fallen tree is ever blocking my path, Donna won't ever have to worry about finding a foot massage again. I think it's a power thing, but if a strong woman racking a 12 gauge does it for anyone else... you're not alone. Donna walks a fine line between the rational confrontation of the perils of Fromville existence and experiencing a mental breakdown from which recovery seems unlikely, and yet she's STILL one of the more reliable players in this cosmological chess game.

* Alcohol Tolerance: 40% abv out of 5
* Durability: 4 out of 5
* Vibes: 3.5 out of 5
* Floorboards: 1 mental break away from not existing out of 5
* BBR/SSCP: 4 out of 5 and the 21st amendment%

**Tian-Chen**

I'm not crying, you're crying. Okay fine, we're both crying, are you happy now? Tian-Chen was low key one of the most important residents of Fromville, and her character is an homage to the untold countless women throughout history who have taken whatever shit situation society has found itself in and turned it into something resembling civilization. Oh people are getting eviscerated by goblins in their own homes? Sit down mother fucker, here's a stack of pancakes and a clean plate to eat them off of. Oh we're stuck in what can only be described as hell and nobody has any clue as to how to escape? Here's a nice communal place for you to eat while you figure it out and oh by the way you bet your sweet ass I'm going to decorate it.

For those of us with East Asian tiger moms in their lives, this comes as no surprise but Tian-Chen is deceptively smart as shit and I would bet $1,000 she knows how to speak much better English than she's letting on, she just doesn't want to talk to your fucking ass. As others have shown before her intelligence was demonstrated with just how quickly she recognized boy Victor in the Polaroid and Jade's symbol in the notebook. Yeah yeah yeah, without Boyd things would be slightly more chaotic, and without Donna the food situation might get a tad more precarious, but with Tian-Chen this shithole actually felt like it could be a home, and now? Well I don't think I need to mention how immediately after losing Tian-Chen a cop showed up and executed Nicky, claiming, ""self-defense."" I mean, I didn't like Nicky either Acosta, but you didn't have to shwack her first chance you got. Ultimately, it was a smart move targeting the Chen master because if you give tiger moms time they will systematically whip everyone into the well-oiled, pancake crushin', straight A receiving, monster ass kickin', Fromville escapin' team they were born to be. 

* Homemaking: A+ out of 5
* Durability: 4 out of 5 (yeah they got her in the end, but she took that partial scalping like a champ).
* Vibes: 4.5 out of 5

**Randall**

Riding the bus? Check. Carrying a rifle on him? Check. Shaved head haircut he clearly gave himself? Check. Anger issues and the propensity to act bravely with speed and purpose? Check. Paranoid libertarian who tried to torture one of the town leaders literally the second someone tried involving him in anything? Check. I don't know how many of you nitwits have someone like this in your life, but let me just say if it isn't revealed that Randall served two tours as an infantryman in the desert then the writers have just perfectly written that hypothetical man with zero awareness to that end. Randall isn't a man in the typical sense of the word, he's a fucking weapons system and sometimes, as Jim found out, it can be really hard to un-deploy a weapons system. Once that missile's off the rail, you better fucking hope it's tracking what you think it's tracking and not going out on its own tying older women to trees.

Honestly, whether or not Randall becomes an asset to the team depends entirely on if they have a leader who earns his respect. Otherwise, the best you can hope for is a peaceful coexistence with a bus libertarian. The worst outcome requires the near-constant monitoring of your fertilizer supply. Look, I'm not saying victory would be certain, but if you had a couple more pipe hitters like Randy boy, a month's supply of energy drinks and Copenhagen chew, two or three pairs of NVG's, and the leader necessary to corral such a group then let's just say these monster fucks would at the very least know that the score ain't as lopsided as it was when you killed my precious little sweet baby angel, Trudy. 

* PTSD: There's a reason he sleeps soundly in the bus at night out of 5
* Durability: 5 out of 5 (survived the monsters, the bugs, the torture chamber, AND Donna)
* Vibes: 2 out of 5 
* Face: 1 out of 2
* BBR/SSCP: 2 out of 5 (if he doesn't respect you) and 4.25 out of 5 (if he does) and 2%

**Kristi**

Look what they've done to my girl. I'm going to be honest, I spent the better part of five minutes scouring the vast depths of the Internet for an updated picture of our favorite Fromville third-year medical student, and let's just say that I'm not the only one who wants to erase that affront to God and nature from our collective memory because wouldn't you know it, I couldn't find one. You might say, ""Yeah, u/ckhaulaway, it's because you use duckduckgo like a schizophrenic who believes that Zuckerberg is monitoring his Internet searches."" Yeah okay, so maybe Randall and I have more in common than I was letting on, sue me. 

As alluded to in part one, I really enjoyed spending so much screen time in season one getting to appreciate Kenny and Kristi's blossoming relationship only for it to get tossed to the side in favor of exploring the hypothetical we're all wondering about: how would an opioid addict deal with demons from the underworld trying to eat her face? I never went to medical school, but based on what we've seen Kristi demonstrate, I'm fairly certain it consists mainly of telling people to squeeze your hand, no harder, squeeze it as hard as you can, okay good. The good thing about Kristi is that she clearly understands how to make good TV, because the second Boyd started scheming to capture Nosferatu Kristi conveniently stepped in a bear trap. My least favorite thing about Kristi is her insistence that the resolution of personal conflict takes precedence over more important and pressing matters. No, Kristi, I don't want to talk about how I'm upset that you broke my heart, we need to collect food to bring back to our starving friends. Jesus Christ.

* Hairstyle: Representation is important out of 5
* Durability: 3.5 out of 5 (Randall would have walked home with the bear trap still attached)
* Vibes: Season one: 5 out of 5. All others: 2.5 out of 5 (justice for my dog Kenny) 
* Hands: squeezed 
* BBR/SSCP: 2.5 out of 5 and 65%

So last week at work was absolutely horrendous.  We only have 9 people in my office and around 5 of them had time off last week or called in cuz if this or that.  

Well Monday was horrible and I was talking about it to my coworker in his office space last Monday.  He was super stressed out and had gotten into trouble for something he messed up, so I figured he was avoiding the situatuon when he called in every single day for the rest of the week.  (For context: he has extreme anxiety due to mainly ptsd and he has called out of work for or left early for before and is heavily medicated for).  So of course I thought that was all this was.  

I had such a rough week last week that the stress triggered my IBS and I called in yesterday.  I went in today and he had returned to work.  I asked him around 2pm where he was all week last week and he said he was ""sick as all hell.""  He gets sick a lot (like once every month) so I asked him with what and here is how the conversation went.  We will call him T and me C: 

T: ""I don't even know for sure if it was Norovirus or not, but uh.   It wasn't covid or anything but I was like.  Projectile v* (one of my greatest fears EVER!) and p* the first 2 days and then had stuff happening on the other end as well for the rest of the week and had a fever of 100°."" 

C: ""Wow.  So did J (his girlfriend) take care of you all week?  Because I saw her come in and grab some stuff for you to work from home on Thursday and I heard (my boss) tell her you had whatever went around the office."" 

(For context, what ""went around"" but was not even viral in the office to like 4 of us girls was a like 24-72 hour sinus infection that wasn't even that serious).  

T: ""J actually did not get it."" 

C: ""What?  How, was she close to you?"" 

T: ""Yeah, I mean she brought me things and what not.  I think honestly I'm not used to being around kids at the beginning of the school year so there's a lot of stuff I don't have an immune system for anymore and that's why I've been sick so much."" 

(More context!: T doesn't have kids of his own but J does so he is around kids a lot now and it is still new to him.)   

So I start kind of backing away from him and trying to get back to my desk.  When I finally do, I'm grabbing clorox wipes and wiping down my entire desk, all my pens, door handles in the office that I touch (I probably looked INSANE to my coworkers) and wiping down my phone, and quickly ate the rest of my lunch I had JUST made before I lost the courage to eat anything at all.  

The good thing is that I had already super cleaned my desk all morning because the bottom of my cup kept leaving sticky shit all over my desk because this rubber piece is coming off, and because I spilled coffee all.  Over.  My keyboard this morning.  

But, I had to go into the men's bathroom today because my boss needed me to order something.  But I went in there before I even knew that he had been sick with that shit.  AND I TOUCHED THE TOILET PAPER.  

But here's what gets me!  Stomach Virus, Norovirus, and all that shit is EXTREMELY contagious so how in the hell did J not get it from T??  I thought maybe his body reacted badly to something, because he was completely fine the day before he started calling in.  In fact he was more energetic than usual.  But at the same time, why would a bad reaction knock him out for a WEEK??  

I don't know but I am so so so scared and terrified of catching whatever that shit was, especially right when one of my favorite holidays is about to happen and I have big plans for it.  My hands are drying out from over washing and my desk was probably wiped down 8 times today between 7am and 4pm.  Ugh.  I hate this phobia and I hate working around people, I just wanna work from home so I don't get trapped in a building with that many risks for 9 hours a day 5 days a week.  I kept holding my breath because it felt as though I couldn't breathe today, especially since not only was T just sick, but a different person in my office was complaining about having body aches and feeling flu-like symptoms all day and wasn't acting herself.  

I just don't know what else to do but if you've read through my very painful retelling and slight panic typing, thank you and I appreciate you haha.  ",1,1729647374.0,emetophobia,1,1.0,False
1g9yver,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1g9yver/wyrms/,Wyrms,"I didn't expect my camping trip to be the nightmare that it was. My high school friend Mark and I have had this tradition of hiking up and camping at Mount Alto in our old hometown since we both turned eighteen. It was a bit of a hassle to plan it every year now that we were adults and had to work around our jobs, but we always pulled it off. We both thought this visit was the most needed out of all of them though. 

Three months ago, Mark's mother succumbed to the cancer that was eating away at her pancreas, and just a few weeks ago my live-in girlfriend Andrea and I decided not only did our ship sail, but it crashed on the rocks. I moved back home with my dad as it was Andrea's apartment I was staying in, and Mark also moved back in with his father in his time of grief, since he was an only child and there was no one else to be around him. 


It had been a while since our last discussion about it, but we were finally able to pack all of our camping gear into Mark's truck and head down the old dirt road that led to the mountain. I can still feel the refreshing breeze of the hot summer air on my face as we rolled down the windows and Mark lowered the volume of the 90s grunge rock music blaring from the truck radio to flash me a grin.


""We made it, just a few more minutes and we'll be at Camp Shangri-la. You did remember to bring toilet paper this time, right?"" He chuckled, his southern accent adding to the light-heartedness of the moment as he jokingly slapped my thigh. I let out a groan and shot him a playful smirk in return, tired of hearing the same old joke.


""Four years ago, man, four years. You're not going to let me live down the whole poison ivy incident, huh?"" I jokingly echoed his playful pat on the leg. ""I'll make you a deal, buddy. I'll hide the toilet paper this time. That way, you can experience what it's like to have a swollen, blistering, asscrack."" 


We both shared a laugh and carried on with our banter, but my thoughts kept drifting back to the recent turmoil between my girlfriend and me. It had only been a few weeks since everything happened, and I knew that healing would take time. The wound on my heart was still fresh, and the shock of it all lingered in my mind. We had been inseparable, crazy about each other. Six years back, we were just two carefree youngsters who crossed paths at a dive bar during a friend's gig. A few coffee dates later, and sparks flew between us. She was the one person who truly got me, and we had a seamless companionship. But when an unexpected pregnancy led to a heartbreaking miscarriage, everything changed. Grief wedged its way between us, causing a gradual drift. I couldn't pinpoint blame on either of us, but the shared loss acted as a silent barrier, pushing us apart.


I glanced over at Mark, his gaze fixed on the rough dirt road ahead as we ascended the familiar hill. His thoughts, however, seemed to have drifted back to the music playing on the radio, evidenced by his off-key singing. As I observed him, I couldn't help but admire his ability to push aside any emotional turmoil, even if it was just for a weekend. The pain of losing a girlfriend paled in comparison to the devastating loss of his mother, who had been a beacon of love and support not just for him, but for all his friends who visited their home. I remembered a time from our childhood when we were both twelve years old and faced a bully at school; while my parents were unable to intervene due to work commitments, Mark's mother fearlessly confronted the issue with the school administration on our behalf. 

However, fate was cruel, and within a short span of time after being diagnosed with cancer, she succumbed to the illness, leaving a void in their family that could never be filled. Cancer had snatched away a truly remarkable soul. As I dwelled on these memories, lost in my thoughts, I suddenly realized that Mark had brought the truck to a stop, silencing the engine.

""We've arrived, dude,"" he exclaimed, his grin spreading from ear to ear. Tossing his sandy blonde locks back from his face, he retrieved some of the smaller camping bags from the backseat. I gazed out the window, unfastening my seatbelt, feeling a wave of peace wash over me as I took in the forested area on my right. This was our sanctuary, our escape from the world. Stepping out of the car, I planted a foot on the pine cone and bark-strewn ground, immediately greeted by the symphony of birdsong and the sweet scent of nature. A sense of serenity enveloped me as I surveyed the woods that now surrounded us. Over by the flatbed of the truck, I could hear Mark grunting as he struggled with our larger bags, tossing them to the ground. I glanced back at him, seeing him haul out the massive bag containing our tent.


""Hey, Mark, I'm gonna take a little walk around here while we're here, and take a leak. I'll lend a hand in a bit,"" I called out, already making my way towards a tree to do so.


""Sure thing"" I heard Mark call out as I strode down the gentle slope into the forest. ""Take it all in and let it all out,"" he added with a chuckle, amused by his own words. I couldn't help but grin at his usual antics, shaking my head as I continued on, enjoying the crackling of twigs and pine needles under my boots. Reaching the base of the hill, I sought out a tree away from our campsite and began to relieve myself. Suddenly, a sound pricked my ears, a faint gasping coming from the nearby creek. It sounded like something struggling to catch their breath but trying to remain silent. Hastily finishing up, I zipped up my pants and cautiously made my way towards the source of the noise.


I could sense that the sound was coming from behind a large rock near the creek bed. However, as I approached, the noise surprisingly grew fainter instead of louder. Upon closer inspection, I discovered the tragic scene before me - a young fawn, mutilated and gasping for air. The deer's wide eyes held a look of fear and desperation as it struggled for breath. The lower half of its body was completely missing, with its entrails scattered on the ground and attracting flies. The remaining top half of the fawn bore small, bloody circular wounds that seemed to be from some sort of sharp object. Feeling overwhelmed and unsure of what to do, I called out for Mark. Even though I couldn't tear my eyes away from the horrific sight, I could hear the sound of Mark racing down the hill towards me.


""What the fuck?"" Mark exclaimed as he stood beside me, his voice trembling as he gazed at the gruesome sight before us.



""What should we do?"" I struggled to articulate, a wave of nausea washing over me as I observed the unfortunate creature. Mark scanned the area and located a hefty rock, lifting it above his head.


""We need to end its suffering,"" he gruffly declared, ""you might want to turn away."" I averted my gaze from the injured animal for the first time, and the sound of the rock Mark wielded striking the deer echoed through the air, putting an end to its agony.


""Jesus!"" Mark's exclamation startled me, prompting me to gaze back at the gruesome sight. Instead of a deer's head, all that remained was a flattened mass of flesh, teeth, and brains, with bright purple wriggling worms squirming within the brain tissue. These chubby purple creatures were nestled in the brain matter of the once-vibrant animal, moving their hairy, gelatinous bodies in a dance like they were at a party or in the throes of merriment.


""What in the hell are those?"" I shouted, taken aback by the unnerving sight of the worms. Mark stood there, wide-eyed, shaking his head in disbelief.


""I don't know. Perhaps some kind of parasite? I've heard that deer can contract a parasite that devours their brain, causing them to behave strangely,"" Mark mused. I turned away, unable to stomach the grotesque scene, and vomited, but Mark continued to talk as if oblivious to my distress. ""As for what may have happened, it could have been wolves. Not a bear, though. We don't have those in this area,"" he remarked, finally noticing my vomiting and offering a comforting pat on the back. ""I've made some progress with setting up the tent. Why don't you take a walk and gather firewood while I finish up? It might help you get some fresh air.""


I nodded, still hunched over and wiping away the drool from my mouth. ""Yeah, sure,"" I managed to say through a few more coughs. After ensuring that nothing else was going to come out of my stomach, I forced myself to move away. The nauseating sensation continued to permeate my body, my face flushing with heat and my stomach threatening to empty itself again. My arms felt heavy, and I had to will my legs to keep moving. It was like wading through thick water.

 I couldn't deny Mark's suggestion about those strange purple worms, but they were unlike anything I had ever encountered before. My knowledge of parasites was limited, but it just felt unnatural for something so repulsive and hairy to exist. Mark, being a veterinarian's assistant, had a good understanding of animals.


I recall visiting the clinic one day to have a lunch break with Mark. He introduced me to the doctor he had been assisting, and as soon as Mark spotted me, he hurriedly led me past the waiting room filled with people and their sick pets. We entered the doctor's office, where he introduced us to Doctor Albright. While Doctor Albright seemed friendly enough, the sight of a jar on his desk containing a dog's heart infested with heart worms was quite unsettling. I understood the concept of showcasing the reason behind the work being done, but the display had a disturbing quality that reminded me of scenes from a horror movie. Despite this, the shocking sight of the infected heart paled in comparison to the unsettling creature Mark and I had just witnessed emerging from the deer's head.


My thoughts were abruptly interrupted as I stumbled, my foot catching on a tree root along the edge of the creek. I tumbled to the ground, my head striking a rock. A flash of white light enveloped my vision, prompting me to shut my eyes against the pulsating pain. Tentatively reaching up to touch the point of impact on my forehead, I felt the dampness of a trickle of blood – just what I needed. Opening my eyes, I discovered that I hadn't collided with a rock, but rather a metal surface. Before me lay a sizable square concrete foundation encasing a large metal circular lid, reminiscent of a manhole cover, complete with handles on the sides.


""What in the fuck?"" I muttered aloud, struggling to stand up after the impact that left me disoriented. Bending down, I peered closer at the curious vent opening. Between the handles, which appeared designed for accessing whatever was concealed beneath, was a string of numbers and letters: '17439-HP10-4A'. Instead of clarifying its purpose, this alphanumeric sequence only piqued my interest further, compelling me to reach for one of the handles.


""Are you alright?"" Mark's concerned voice behind me interrupted my contemplation, causing me to turn and motion him over.


""Come take a look at this, I found something."" I called back, gesturing towards the mysterious lid. As Mark approached and observed the unusual opening, a look of bewilderment crossed his face.


""I don't know what it is, but I have a feeling whatever is below is just waiting for us to dive in on an adventure,"" I said with a touch of cheesy excitement. Mark chuckled and playfully rolled his eyes, motioning to grab the handle on the opposite side of me. Without hesitation, I reached out for the handle on my side as we both silently counted down from three, preparing to lift.


The lid was incredibly heavy, causing us to strain and grunt as we attempted to budge the metal covering. I felt a trickle of sweat mix with the blood from  the small cut above my eyebrow, but the adrenaline kept me pushing forward. As we continued to heave the weighty object, it eventually gave way and lifted, leaving Mark and me holding it just a few inches above the opening.


With a final effort, we carefully shifted the cover to the side on the ground, revealing the hidden depths beneath. Peering into the darkness, we both felt a surge of curiosity and anticipation.


In front of us, a gaping hole revealed a stainless steel staircase descending into darkness. The pitch black surroundings made it difficult to make out much  details, but the sunlight above hinted at an arching passageway just past the stairs leading further underground. I caught Mark's eyes, and he returned the silent exchange before gesturing for me to go first.


Turning to my pocket, I pulled out my cellphone and turned on the flashlight, disregarding the lack of service bars on my home screen. Stepping onto the metal staircase, each clang resonated loudly as I descended, Mark's steady steps echoing mine a few paces behind. His phone illuminated the space above my head as we ventured downward.


As I neared the bottom, my light swept over the doorless, expansive hallway, revealing only mundane concrete walls with a peculiar touch of black paint on either side of the entrance. The markings read ""SITE 17439-HP10-4A-A1,"" leaving us to wonder what awaited beyond.


I glanced back at Mark, who had his light fixed on the same lettering, shaking his head in bewilderment like me. Moving down the hallway, the feeble glow from my phone revealed a plain wooden door at the far end, adorned with a glass panel window that hinted at an office beyond, though visibility was scarce. My hand reached for the doorknob just as Mark's voice gave me pause.


""Wait."" I turned to find him standing behind me, the brightness of his phone obscuring his features. ""Maybe we should reconsider. This seems more heavy than we thought,"" he hesitated, ""like it could involve some shady government stuff. I don't want to get mixed up in legal trouble.""


I scoffed, ""Seriously? We've come this far, and besides, look inside."" Gesturing with my phone towards the window, I continued, ""It's just as dark in there as it is out here."" I turned the knob, feeling the door unlatch from the concrete wall. ""This place is deserted. No one knows we're here in the middle of nowhere in buttfuck Georgia, exploring some mysterious underground bunker,"" I declared, already stepping through the doorway.


Surveying the room, the once typical reception area now appeared desolate, as if hastily vacated. The sizable white desk, hosting two now-disconnected computers, had its drawers forcibly yanked open, eerily empty. The towers of the machines had been stripped bare, bereft of their hardware, leaving only hollow shells behind. A noticeable absence of grime on the walls hinted at where frames once held portraits or artworks now absent. Dark hallways stretched into the underground facility from each side, the darkness impenetrable from our vantage point.


 Adjacent to one corridor lay three overturned filing cabinets. Intrigued, I cautiously advanced further into the room, and my steps echoed in the unsettling silence. A damp squelch underfoot drew my attention downwards, and pointing my phone to the floor with my light, I discovered a small pool of a peculiar, gel-like substance. As I tried to lift my foot, the liquid resisted, its surface teeming with tiny, shifting bubbles. Examining my boot, I noticed a similar layer coating the sole, mirroring the bubbling activity beneath. Alerting Mark to the unusual sight, I directed his attention to the odd liquid clinging to my boot, seeking his thoughts.


""What's your take on this?"" I asked, prompting him to abandon the filing cabinets he was standing over and scrutinize the mysterious substance. His response was punctuated by a contemplative hum, suggesting deep thought.


""I dont know. It seems to look like the mucus left by a snail, but I can't be certain. Better not touch it,"" Mark cautioned, his eyes scanning the room for clues. ""I spotted something similar on one of the  filing cabinets, but I sure as hell didnt touch it.""


Directing my phone's light towards the cabinets he mentioned, I asked, ""Did you find anything in there?""


""No,"" he replied tersely. ""There wasn't a single file folder inside. What's even more peculiar is how spotless this place appears, despite its emptiness.""


Mark's observation was astute; the reception area, apart from the strange liquid I had encountered, was unusually clean for an abandoned location. There wasnt any dust, as if it had only been empty a short time, but suddenly a noise emanated from one of the hallways, jolting us from our thoughts. The sound of someone struggling for breath and grunting in pain reverberated through the silent air, prompting Mark to cast me an alarmed glance.


""Someone is still here"" Mark exclaimed urgently. Before I had a chance to reply, he sprinted down the hallway in the direction of the distressing sounds. I followed suit, trying to keep pace with him, but he had a significant advantage in speed, being a track team member back in school.


""Mark, hold on!"" I shouted, struggling to close the gap between us, but his agility outmatched mine, compounded by his initial head start.


""Someone is injured, Luke!"" he called out as he neared the corner where the cries echoed from. Determined to catch up, I pushed myself harder, yet I couldn't reach him in speed.


As I approached, my heart sank at the sight before me. Mark had reached the hallway's corner just as a figure pounced on him from the darkness. He staggered backward, pinned against the wall by the assailant. Drawing closer, I discerned the figure latched onto Mark was a man. His khaki pants drenched in the strange liquid I had encountered, bubbles forming amidst the dampness. His torn lab coat, covered with vomit, revealed the familiar purple worms from those on the deer we saw earlier.


With a desperate gaze, the man peered up at Mark through shattered eyeglasses, one eye infested with wriggling worms protruding from his pupil, waving left and right trying to reach out to Mark.


""Please..."" the stranger pleaded with Mark, who attempted to pull away from his grip. ""We were mistaken. It cannot die. It refuses to let us die"" His voice was chilling, a cacophony of two distinct tones speaking simultaneously. One voice filled with anguish, the other eerily serene. With each word he spoke, more of those grotesque worms spilled out of his mouth and onto Mark's waist. Mark managed to deliver a knee to the man's chest, dislodging his grip, before bolting back in the direction we had come from, grasping my arm in the process.



""GO!"" Mark bellowed, his voice cutting through the air like a knife. Without hesitation, I pivoted on my heels and sprinted after him, my heart pounding in my chest. Behind us, the man's desperate gasps and moans echoed down the corridor. I glanced back  to see the man on his knees, retching up a grotesque mass of worms onto the floor. Tears streamed down his face as he whispered apologies into the darkness, his voice raw with desperation, and those same dual voices.


 There was no time for sympathy as I turned my attention back to Mark, my muscles straining as I pushed myself to keep pace. Just as I thought we might escape, a door swung open with a deafening crash, slamming into my face with brutal force. Agony exploded through my skull as I stumbled backwards, and crashed to the ground just as everything around me went dark. 


As my eyes fluttered open, I was met with a wave of excruciating pain that threatened to consume me. My head pounded relentlessly, my ears rang with a deafening sound. Blood dripped down my face, mingling with my tears as I lay on my back, disoriented and lost.


The surrounding chaos blurred into indiscernible shapes and shadows, but the agonizing cries of wounded animals echoed through the darkness. Staring at the ceiling I could tell I was no longer in the hallway, but in a different room. With a heavy groan, I mustered all of my strength to roll onto my side, only to discover my cell phone lying next to me, its flashlight casting a glow.


Barely able to lift myself to my knees, I grasped the phone and brought it closer to my face. Through the haze, I saw a message displayed on the screen - a cryptic warning was left in the body of a text from myself with no recipient.


 ""Sorry about knocking you out, ""but there's no time. It's loose, and they're coming. Find the key in your pocket, take a left and head for the stairs. I'm already gone, you won't find me. Tell them what you saw.""


As the gravity of the situation sunk in, I realized that I needed to hurry. I groaned more as I pulled myself to my feet. Shining my phone ahead of me to get an understanding of where I was. In front of me was a large metal table, littered with broken vials and scattered papers covered in some kind of chemical. To the left of the table were large kennels stacked on top of each other, I walked over to them I was startled to see the animals that were inside. In one was a brown falcon, laying on its side and flailing its wing and legs, those hairy purple worms were covering its body, digging in and back out of holes covering its body, it's flailing wing had several of them nestled in between its feathers, some of them were flying off with every flap. 


In another kennel, was a small bulldog, dripping out of the mouth with worms, it lunged towards the door of the kennel barking at me trying to break free. Another kennel had another baby deer that was constantly screaming, both its eyes were gone and in its place were just mounds of wriggling, purple hairy worms. I stepped backwards away from the horrible site backing in to the table, my hand bracing on one of the wet pieces of paper on the table. I moved my light over it and could make some of it out, but the chemical poured over it made it difficult to read. 


**The study of (illegible) infestations has taken a terrifying turn as we observe the takeover of hosts by these new entities that grant them incredible strength, dexterity, and an unyielding resistance to conventional forms of (illegible). As the impending threat of human testing looms, ethical concerns abound as we witness the monstrous transformation of subjects into seemingly unkillable beings.


Methods: Subjects were exposed to parasitic infestation through controlled ingestion of contaminated food sources. Observations were made over an extended period to assess the progression of the infestation and its effects on host physiology.


Results: The parasitic infestation led to a nightmarish transformation in hosts, as they exhibited unprecedented muscle growth, enhanced dexterity, and an alarming increase in cell growth that rendered them impervious to traditional methods of treatment. Subjects displayed a terrifying hostility towards researchers and demonstrated a chilling ability to survive lethal doses of eradication attempts.


Discussion: The findings of this study reveal a sinister power within the parasitic entities that take control of hosts, granting them superhuman (illegible) and an unnerving resilience to harm. The ethical implications of continuing such experiments on human subjects are deeply troubling, as the potential consequences of unleashing these monstrous capabilities are beyond comprehension.


Conclusion: The parasitic infestation has unleashed a (illegible) within our research facility, as hosts are transformed into terrifying beings with incomprehensible strength, dexterity, and invulnerability. The looming specter of human testing raises grave concerns about the ethical boundaries we are willing to cross in the pursuit of scientific knowledge. As a researcher haunted by the horrors I have witnessed, I fear the horrors that may be unleashed if we continue down this treacherous path.**


I dropped the soggy paper back down on the table, having an inclination that whoever had written this report may be the person who dragged me into this room. I started towards the open doorway of the room, even more eager than before to leave. I stood in the hallway and recognized the staircase leading up the phone message must have been referring to 50 or so yards to my left, but a wet growling noise to my right caught my attention. Turning around, my heart froze at the sight of a large, humanoid creature clinging to the side of the wall on all fours. 


The purple skinned humanoid creature loomed before me, its labcoat and khakis in shreds and tatters. Its broken frame eyeglasses were askew on its large, yellow, predatory eyes that seemed to pierce through my very soul with a malevolent glow. Its muscular arms and legs were elongated and sinewy, with patches of dark hairs erupting from its sickly violet skin. The creature's bald head was adorned with a writhing mass of long, purple, worm-like tendrils that cascaded down its spine, wriggling and squirming in a grotesque display.


And from its twisted, contorted mouth hung the gruesome visage of my friend Mark's decapitated head, blood still oozing from the severed neck, the lifeless eyes staring blankly ahead. The creature stood there in eerie silence, a nightmarish amalgamation of horror and desolation, its presence sending chills down my spine as I struggled to comprehend the unimaginable sight before me. It opened its mouth and let out another wet growl, dropping Mark's head to the ground in the process. I was no longer frozen in place, it seemed as if my body moved on its own as I turned around and began racing for the staircase.


 I could hear the creature behind me running along the walls in hot pursuit of me. Every fiber of my body screamed in pain as I struggled to run across the concrete ground, hearing the beast pounce from wall to wall in its attempt to catch me, bellowing out an unearthly scream in its frustration. 


My legs seemed to find new strength while I ran up the cold staircase, and I propelled my whole body up into the double door covering that was at the very end of the staircase. Standing once again in the woods of Mount Alto, I looked around for something to keep the doors closed and quickly found a heavy tree branch just laying a few feet away from me. Hurriedly I grabbed it and dragged it back to the doorway and wedged it under the handle of the doors just as the creature threw itself into them causing the doors to budge slightly and the branch crack a little. 


I turned away and started running away along the creek bed, seeing the familiar hill Mark parked on just up ahead. My lungs felt like they were about to explode from the amount I was exerting myself as I passed the metal covering Mark and I used to enter the underground lab, but I couldn't slow down, not even as I passed the fawn we saw earlier, trying to push itself up on its remaining two legs despite not having a lower body or head. 


I fell to my hands and knees hearing the roar of the creature in the distance as I climbed the hill without falling standing up, and throwing myself in to Mark's truck once I made it to the top. I cussed as my nervous hands struggled to turn the key in the ignition, but settled myself once I heard the truck pur to life. As quickly as I could I made a sharp U-turn and began speeding off back to town on the bumpy dirt road that got us here. Along the way, I could hear helicopters above tearing through the sky, but I felt comfortable they couldn't see the truck through the canopy of trees. 


That was three days ago. Despite seeing several strange armored jeeps heading in the direction of Mount Alto, and occasionally seeing helicopters flying overhead in town, there has been complete media silence. I haven't been able to sleep, and I'm afraid of leaving my home. I don't know what was going on in that bunker, but whatever they were working on, is out now.

1g9yu6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersOfHorror/comments/1g9yu6j/wyrms/,Wyrms,"I didn't expect my camping trip to be the nightmare that it was. My high school friend Mark and I have had this tradition of hiking up and camping at Mount Alto in our old hometown since we both turned eighteen. It was a bit of a hassle to plan it every year now that we were adults and had to work around our jobs, but we always pulled it off. We both thought this visit was the most needed out of all of them though. 

Three months ago, Mark's mother succumbed to the cancer that was eating away at her pancreas, and just a few weeks ago my live-in girlfriend Andrea and I decided not only did our ship sail, but it crashed on the rocks. I moved back home with my dad as it was Andrea's apartment I was staying in, and Mark also moved back in with his father in his time of grief, since he was an only child and there was no one else to be around him. 


It had been a while since our last discussion about it, but we were finally able to pack all of our camping gear into Mark's truck and head down the old dirt road that led to the mountain. I can still feel the refreshing breeze of the hot summer air on my face as we rolled down the windows and Mark lowered the volume of the 90s grunge rock music blaring from the truck radio to flash me a grin.


""We made it, just a few more minutes and we'll be at Camp Shangri-la. You did remember to bring toilet paper this time, right?"" He chuckled, his southern accent adding to the light-heartedness of the moment as he jokingly slapped my thigh. I let out a groan and shot him a playful smirk in return, tired of hearing the same old joke.


""Four years ago, man, four years. You're not going to let me live down the whole poison ivy incident, huh?"" I jokingly echoed his playful pat on the leg. ""I'll make you a deal, buddy. I'll hide the toilet paper this time. That way, you can experience what it's like to have a swollen, blistering, asscrack."" 


We both shared a laugh and carried on with our banter, but my thoughts kept drifting back to the recent turmoil between my girlfriend and me. It had only been a few weeks since everything happened, and I knew that healing would take time. The wound on my heart was still fresh, and the shock of it all lingered in my mind. We had been inseparable, crazy about each other. Six years back, we were just two carefree youngsters who crossed paths at a dive bar during a friend's gig.

My thoughts were abruptly interrupted as I stumbled, my foot catching on a tree root along the edge of the creek. I tumbled to the ground, my head striking a rock. A flash of white light enveloped my vision, prompting me to shut my eyes against the pulsating pain. Tentatively reaching up to touch the point of impact on my forehead, I felt the dampness of a trickle of blood – just what I needed. Opening my eyes, I discovered that I hadn't collided with a rock, but rather a metal surface. Before me lay a sizable square concrete foundation encasing a large metal circular lid, reminiscent of a manhole cover, complete with handles on the sides.


""What in the fuck?"" I muttered aloud, struggling to stand up after the impact that left me disoriented. Bending down, I peered closer at the curious vent opening. Between the handles, which appeared designed for accessing whatever was concealed beneath, was a string of numbers and letters: '17439-HP10-4A'. Instead of clarifying its purpose, this alphanumeric sequence only piqued my interest further, compelling me to reach for one of the handles.


""Are you alright?"" Mark's concerned voice behind me interrupted my contemplation, causing me to turn and motion him over.


""Come take a look at this, I found something."" I called back, gesturing towards the mysterious lid. As Mark approached and observed the unusual opening, a look of bewilderment crossed his face.


""I don't know what it is, but I have a feeling whatever is below is just waiting for us to dive in on an adventure,"" I said with a touch of cheesy excitement. Mark chuckled and playfully rolled his eyes, motioning to grab the handle on the opposite side of me. Without hesitation, I reached out for the handle on my side as we both silently counted down from three, preparing to lift.


The lid was incredibly heavy, causing us to strain and grunt as we attempted to budge the metal covering. I felt a trickle of sweat mix with the blood from  the small cut above my eyebrow, but the adrenaline kept me pushing forward. As we continued to heave the weighty object, it eventually gave way and lifted, leaving Mark and me holding it just a few inches above the opening.


With a final effort, we carefully shifted the cover to the side on the ground, revealing the hidden depths beneath. Peering into the darkness, we both felt a surge of curiosity and anticipation.


In front of us, a gaping hole revealed a stainless steel staircase descending into darkness. The pitch black surroundings made it difficult to make out much  details, but the sunlight above hinted at an arching passageway just past the stairs leading further underground. I caught Mark's eyes, and he returned the silent exchange before gesturing for me to go first.


Turning to my pocket, I pulled out my cellphone and turned on the flashlight, disregarding the lack of service bars on my home screen. Stepping onto the metal staircase, each clang resonated loudly as I descended, Mark's steady steps echoing mine a few paces behind. His phone illuminated the space above my head as we ventured downward.


As I neared the bottom, my light swept over the doorless, expansive hallway, revealing only mundane concrete walls with a peculiar touch of black paint on either side of the entrance. The markings read ""SITE 17439-HP10-4A-A1,"" leaving us to wonder what awaited beyond.


I glanced back at Mark, who had his light fixed on the same lettering, shaking his head in bewilderment like me. Moving down the hallway, the feeble glow from my phone revealed a plain wooden door at the far end, adorned with a glass panel window that hinted at an office beyond, though visibility was scarce. My hand reached for the doorknob just as Mark's voice gave me pause.


""Wait."" I turned to find him standing behind me, the brightness of his phone obscuring his features. ""Maybe we should reconsider. This seems more heavy than we thought,"" he hesitated, ""like it could involve some shady government stuff. I don't want to get mixed up in legal trouble.""


I scoffed, ""Seriously? We've come this far, and besides, look inside."" Gesturing with my phone towards the window, I continued, ""It's just as dark in there as it is out here."" I turned the knob, feeling the door unlatch from the concrete wall. ""This place is deserted. No one knows we're here in the middle of nowhere in buttfuck Georgia, exploring some mysterious underground bunker,"" I declared, already stepping through the doorway.


Surveying the room, the once typical reception area now appeared desolate, as if hastily vacated. The sizable white desk, hosting two now-disconnected computers, had its drawers forcibly yanked open, eerily empty. The towers of the machines had been stripped bare, bereft of their hardware, leaving only hollow shells behind. A noticeable absence of grime on the walls hinted at where frames once held portraits or artworks now absent. Dark hallways stretched into the underground facility from each side, the darkness impenetrable from our vantage point.


 Adjacent to one corridor lay three overturned filing cabinets. Intrigued, I cautiously advanced further into the room, and my steps echoed in the unsettling silence. A damp squelch underfoot drew my attention downwards, and pointing my phone to the floor with my light, I discovered a small pool of a peculiar, gel-like substance. As I tried to lift my foot, the liquid resisted, its surface teeming with tiny, shifting bubbles. Examining my boot, I noticed a similar layer coating the sole, mirroring the bubbling activity beneath. Alerting Mark to the unusual sight, I directed his attention to the odd liquid clinging to my boot, seeking his thoughts.


""What's your take on this?"" I asked, prompting him to abandon the filing cabinets he was standing over and scrutinize the mysterious substance. His response was punctuated by a contemplative hum, suggesting deep thought.


""I dont know. It seems to look like the mucus left by a snail, but I can't be certain. Better not touch it,"" Mark cautioned, his eyes scanning the room for clues. ""I spotted something similar on one of the  filing cabinets, but I sure as hell didnt touch it.""


Directing my phone's light towards the cabinets he mentioned, I asked, ""Did you find anything in there?""


""No,"" he replied tersely. ""There wasn't a single file folder inside. What's even more peculiar is how spotless this place appears, despite its emptiness.""


Mark's observation was astute; the reception area, apart from the strange liquid I had encountered, was unusually clean for an abandoned location. There wasnt any dust, as if it had only been empty a short time, but suddenly a noise emanated from one of the hallways, jolting us from our thoughts. The sound of someone struggling for breath and grunting in pain reverberated through the silent air, prompting Mark to cast me an alarmed glance.


""Someone is still here"" Mark exclaimed urgently. Before I had a chance to reply, he sprinted down the hallway in the direction of the distressing sounds. I followed suit, trying to keep pace with him, but he had a significant advantage in speed, being a track team member back in school.


""Mark, hold on!"" I shouted, struggling to close the gap between us, but his agility outmatched mine, compounded by his initial head start.


""Someone is injured, Luke!"" he called out as he neared the corner where the cries echoed from. Determined to catch up, I pushed myself harder, yet I couldn't reach him in speed.


As I approached, my heart sank at the sight before me. Mark had reached the hallway's corner just as a figure pounced on him from the darkness. He staggered backward, pinned against the wall by the assailant. Drawing closer, I discerned the figure latched onto Mark was a man. His khaki pants drenched in the strange liquid I had encountered, bubbles forming amidst the dampness. His torn lab coat, covered with vomit, revealed the familiar purple worms from those on the deer we saw earlier.


With a desperate gaze, the man peered up at Mark through shattered eyeglasses, one eye infested with wriggling worms protruding from his pupil, waving left and right trying to reach out to Mark.


""Please..."" the stranger pleaded with Mark, who attempted to pull away from his grip. ""We were mistaken. It cannot die. It refuses to let us die"" His voice was chilling, a cacophony of two distinct tones speaking simultaneously. One voice filled with anguish, the other eerily serene. With each word he spoke, more of those grotesque worms spilled out of his mouth and onto Mark's waist. Mark managed to deliver a knee to the man's chest, dislodging his grip, before bolting back in the direction we had come from, grasping my arm in the process.



""GO!"" Mark bellowed, his voice cutting through the air like a knife. Without hesitation, I pivoted on my heels and sprinted after him, my heart pounding in my chest. Behind us, the man's desperate gasps and moans echoed down the corridor. I glanced back  to see the man on his knees, retching up a grotesque mass of worms onto the floor. Tears streamed down his face as he whispered apologies into the darkness, his voice raw with desperation, and those same dual voices.


 There was no time for sympathy as I turned my attention back to Mark, my muscles straining as I pushed myself to keep pace. Just as I thought we might escape, a door swung open with a deafening crash, slamming into my face with brutal force. Agony exploded through my skull as I stumbled backwards, and crashed to the ground just as everything around me went dark. 


As my eyes fluttered open, I was met with a wave of excruciating pain that threatened to consume me. My head pounded relentlessly, my ears rang with a deafening sound. Blood dripped down my face, mingling with my tears as I lay on my back, disoriented and lost.


The surrounding chaos blurred into indiscernible shapes and shadows, but the agonizing cries of wounded animals echoed through the darkness. Staring at the ceiling I could tell I was no longer in the hallway, but in a different room. With a heavy groan, I mustered all of my strength to roll onto my side, only to discover my cell phone lying next to me, its flashlight casting a glow.


Barely able to lift myself to my knees, I grasped the phone and brought it closer to my face. Through the haze, I saw a message displayed on the screen - a cryptic warning was left in the body of a text from myself with no recipient.


 ""Sorry about knocking you out, ""but there's no time. It's loose, and they're coming. Find the key in your pocket, take a left and head for the stairs. I'm already gone, you won't find me. Tell them what you saw.""


As the gravity of the situation sunk in, I realized that I needed to hurry. I groaned more as I pulled myself to my feet. Shining my phone ahead of me to get an understanding of where I was. In front of me was a large metal table, littered with broken vials and scattered papers covered in some kind of chemical. To the left of the table were large kennels stacked on top of each other, I walked over to them I was startled to see the animals that were inside. In one was a brown falcon, laying on its side and flailing its wing and legs, those hairy purple worms were covering its body, digging in and back out of holes covering its body, it's flailing wing had several of them nestled in between its feathers, some of them were flying off with every flap. 


In another kennel, was a small bulldog, dripping out of the mouth with worms, it lunged towards the door of the kennel barking at me trying to break free. Another kennel had another baby deer that was constantly screaming, both its eyes were gone and in its place were just mounds of wriggling, purple hairy worms. I stepped backwards away from the horrible site backing in to the table, my hand bracing on one of the wet pieces of paper on the table. I moved my light over it and could make some of it out, but the chemical poured over it made it difficult to read. 


**The study of (illegible) infestations has taken a terrifying turn as we observe the takeover of hosts by these new entities that grant them incredible strength, dexterity, and an unyielding resistance to conventional forms of (illegible). As the impending threat of human testing looms, ethical concerns abound as we witness the monstrous transformation of subjects into seemingly unkillable beings.


Methods: Subjects were exposed to parasitic infestation through controlled ingestion of contaminated food sources. Observations were made over an extended period to assess the progression of the infestation and its effects on host physiology.


Results: The parasitic infestation led to a nightmarish transformation in hosts, as they exhibited unprecedented muscle growth, enhanced dexterity, and an alarming increase in cell growth that rendered them impervious to traditional methods of treatment. Subjects displayed a terrifying hostility towards researchers and demonstrated a chilling ability to survive lethal doses of eradication attempts.


Discussion: The findings of this study reveal a sinister power within the parasitic entities that take control of hosts, granting them superhuman (illegible) and an unnerving resilience to harm. The ethical implications of continuing such experiments on human subjects are deeply troubling, as the potential consequences of unleashing these monstrous capabilities are beyond comprehension.


Conclusion: The parasitic infestation has unleashed a (illegible) within our research facility, as hosts are transformed into terrifying beings with incomprehensible strength, dexterity, and invulnerability. The looming specter of human testing raises grave concerns about the ethical boundaries we are willing to cross in the pursuit of scientific knowledge. As a researcher haunted by the horrors I have witnessed, I fear the horrors that may be unleashed if we continue down this treacherous path.**


I dropped the soggy paper back down on the table, having an inclination that whoever had written this report may be the person who dragged me into this room. I started towards the open doorway of the room, even more eager than before to leave. I stood in the hallway and recognized the staircase leading up the phone message must have been referring to 50 or so yards to my left, but a wet growling noise to my right caught my attention. Turning around, my heart froze at the sight of a large, humanoid creature clinging to the side of the wall on all fours. 


The purple skinned humanoid creature loomed before me, its labcoat and khakis in shreds and tatters. Its broken frame eyeglasses were askew on its large, yellow, predatory eyes that seemed to pierce through my very soul with a malevolent glow. Its muscular arms and legs were elongated and sinewy, with patches of dark hairs erupting from its sickly violet skin. The creature's bald head was adorned with a writhing mass of long, purple, worm-like tendrils that cascaded down its spine, wriggling and squirming in a grotesque display.


And from its twisted, contorted mouth hung the gruesome visage of my friend Mark's decapitated head, blood still oozing from the severed neck, the lifeless eyes staring blankly ahead. The creature stood there in eerie silence, a nightmarish amalgamation of horror and desolation, its presence sending chills down my spine as I struggled to comprehend the unimaginable sight before me. It opened its mouth and let out another wet growl, dropping Mark's head to the ground in the process. I was no longer frozen in place, it seemed as if my body moved on its own as I turned around and began racing for the staircase.


 I could hear the creature behind me running along the walls in hot pursuit of me. Every fiber of my body screamed in pain as I struggled to run across the concrete ground, hearing the beast pounce from wall to wall in its attempt to catch me, bellowing out an unearthly scream in its frustration. 


My legs seemed to find new strength while I ran up the cold staircase, and I propelled my whole body up into the double door covering that was at the very end of the staircase. Standing once again in the woods of Mount Alto, I looked around for something to keep the doors closed and quickly found a heavy tree branch just laying a few feet away from me. Hurriedly I grabbed it and dragged it back to the doorway and wedged it under the handle of the doors just as the creature threw itself into them causing the doors to budge slightly and the branch crack a little. 


I turned away and started running away along the creek bed, seeing the familiar hill Mark parked on just up ahead. My lungs felt like they were about to explode from the amount I was exerting myself as I passed the metal covering Mark and I used to enter the underground lab, but I couldn't slow down, not even as I passed the fawn we saw earlier, trying to push itself up on its remaining two legs despite not having a lower body or head. 


I fell to my hands and knees hearing the roar of the creature in the distance as I climbed the hill without falling standing up, and throwing myself in to Mark's truck once I made it to the top. I cussed as my nervous hands struggled to turn the key in the ignition, but settled myself once I heard the truck pur to life. As quickly as I could I made a sharp U-turn and began speeding off back to town on the bumpy dirt road that got us here. Along the way, I could hear helicopters above tearing through the sky, but I felt comfortable they couldn't see the truck through the canopy of trees. 


That was three days ago. Despite seeing several strange armored jeeps heading in the direction of Mount Alto, and occasionally seeing helicopters flying overhead in town, there has been complete media silence. I haven't been able to sleep, and I'm afraid of leaving my home. I don't know what was going on in that bunker, but whatever they were working on, is out now.

I am a first time coffee machine owner and recently got the Breville Barista Express and have watched a million tiktoks and youtube videos on what to do but I've been encountering the following problems and have had no one to ask on how to fix. It would be greatly appreciated if you had any tips and tricks at all for a noobie like me!

Just some general things I do/have: I single dose my coffee beans (weigh out 18g and grind a single dose of beans), i've adjusted my grind size so that my double shot pours in around 25-30s (I use a medium-dark roast from Stereoscope Coffee), I use a manual WDT tool, normcore gravity distributor and a spring loaded tamp (in that order) and a puck screen. The shots I pour have good crema but I'm not too experienced on how the espresso SHOULD taste as I solely drink lattes but from the lattes I've made for myself - I have noticed when I don't get that extraction ratio that I'm aiming for (1:2) it does have an off-putting taste to it.

The following are a list of problem/concerns I've had that would like to have addressed:

1. When I dose out 18.0g of beans sometimes I'll get not 18.0g of grounds (18.3/18.5/19/20) - albeit this is a smaller problem and I think has something to do with the static and/or beans from the previous day not fully being cleaned out of the bean hopper and has some residual.
2. I've programmed a double shot dose to ideally pour our 36g of espresso multiple times - but the output has been wildly inconsistent (i assume this is definitely user error and theres somewhere along the line of my puck prep that is causing this inconsistency - but I want to drill down where that is) my bar pressure always comes up to the around the same amount of pressure. From my perspective, I've done the same puck prep and the output of my espresso shot was 23g while the next one was 40g.

Thank you in advance for any tips and tricks!",3,1729647153.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

1g9yt4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1g9yt4t/wyrms/,Wyrms,"I didn't expect my camping trip to be the nightmare that it was. My high school friend Mark and I have had this tradition of hiking up and camping at Mount Alto in our old hometown since we both turned eighteen. It was a bit of a hassle to plan it every year now that we were adults and had to work around our jobs, but we always pulled it off. We both thought this visit was the most needed out of all of them though. 

Three months ago, Mark's mother succumbed to the cancer that was eating away at her pancreas, and just a few weeks ago my live-in girlfriend Andrea and I decided not only did our ship sail, but it crashed on the rocks. I moved back home with my dad as it was Andrea's apartment I was staying in, and Mark also moved back in with his father in his time of grief, since he was an only child and there was no one else to be around him. 


It had been a while since our last discussion about it, but we were finally able to pack all of our camping gear into Mark's truck and head down the old dirt road that led to the mountain. I can still feel the refreshing breeze of the hot summer air on my face as we rolled down the windows and Mark lowered the volume of the 90s grunge rock music blaring from the truck radio to flash me a grin.


""We made it, just a few more minutes and we'll be at Camp Shangri-la. You did remember to bring toilet paper this time, right?"" He chuckled, his southern accent adding to the light-heartedness of the moment as he jokingly slapped my thigh. I let out a groan and shot him a playful smirk in return, tired of hearing the same old joke.


""Four years ago, man, four years. You're not going to let me live down the whole poison ivy incident, huh?"" I jokingly echoed his playful pat on the leg. ""I'll make you a deal, buddy. I'll hide the toilet paper this time. That way, you can experience what it's like to have a swollen, blistering, asscrack."" 


We both shared a laugh and carried on with our banter, but my thoughts kept drifting back to the recent turmoil between my girlfriend and me. It had only been a few weeks since everything happened, and I knew that healing would take time. The wound on my heart was still fresh, and the shock of it all lingered in my mind. We had been inseparable, crazy about each other. Six years back, we were just two carefree youngsters who crossed paths at a dive bar during a friend's gig. A few coffee dates later, and sparks flew between us. She was the one person who truly got me, and we had a seamless companionship. But when an unexpected pregnancy led to a heartbreaking miscarriage, everything changed. Grief wedged its way between us, causing a gradual drift. I couldn't pinpoint blame on either of us, but the shared loss acted as a silent barrier, pushing us apart.


I glanced over at Mark, his gaze fixed on the rough dirt road ahead as we ascended the familiar hill. His thoughts, however, seemed to have drifted back to the music playing on the radio, evidenced by his off-key singing. As I observed him, I couldn't help but admire his ability to push aside any emotional turmoil, even if it was just for a weekend. The pain of losing a girlfriend paled in comparison to the devastating loss of his mother, who had been a beacon of love and support not just for him, but for all his friends who visited their home. I remembered a time from our childhood when we were both twelve years old and faced a bully at school; while my parents were unable to intervene due to work commitments, Mark's mother fearlessly confronted the issue with the school administration on our behalf. 

However, fate was cruel, and within a short span of time after being diagnosed with cancer, she succumbed to the illness, leaving a void in their family that could never be filled. Cancer had snatched away a truly remarkable soul. As I dwelled on these memories, lost in my thoughts, I suddenly realized that Mark had brought the truck to a stop, silencing the engine.

""We've arrived, dude,"" he exclaimed, his grin spreading from ear to ear. Tossing his sandy blonde locks back from his face, he retrieved some of the smaller camping bags from the backseat. I gazed out the window, unfastening my seatbelt, feeling a wave of peace wash over me as I took in the forested area on my right. This was our sanctuary, our escape from the world. Stepping out of the car, I planted a foot on the pine cone and bark-strewn ground, immediately greeted by the symphony of birdsong and the sweet scent of nature. A sense of serenity enveloped me as I surveyed the woods that now surrounded us. Over by the flatbed of the truck, I could hear Mark grunting as he struggled with our larger bags, tossing them to the ground. I glanced back at him, seeing him haul out the massive bag containing our tent.


""Hey, Mark, I'm gonna take a little walk around here while we're here, and take a leak. I'll lend a hand in a bit,"" I called out, already making my way towards a tree to do so.


""Sure thing"" I heard Mark call out as I strode down the gentle slope into the forest. ""Take it all in and let it all out,"" he added with a chuckle, amused by his own words. I couldn't help but grin at his usual antics, shaking my head as I continued on, enjoying the crackling of twigs and pine needles under my boots. Reaching the base of the hill, I sought out a tree away from our campsite and began to relieve myself. Suddenly, a sound pricked my ears, a faint gasping coming from the nearby creek. It sounded like something struggling to catch their breath but trying to remain silent. Hastily finishing up, I zipped up my pants and cautiously made my way towards the source of the noise.


I could sense that the sound was coming from behind a large rock near the creek bed. However, as I approached, the noise surprisingly grew fainter instead of louder. Upon closer inspection, I discovered the tragic scene before me - a young fawn, mutilated and gasping for air. The deer's wide eyes held a look of fear and desperation as it struggled for breath. The lower half of its body was completely missing, with its entrails scattered on the ground and attracting flies. The remaining top half of the fawn bore small, bloody circular wounds that seemed to be from some sort of sharp object. Feeling overwhelmed and unsure of what to do, I called out for Mark. Even though I couldn't tear my eyes away from the horrific sight, I could hear the sound of Mark racing down the hill towards me.


""What the fuck?"" Mark exclaimed as he stood beside me, his voice trembling as he gazed at the gruesome sight before us.



""What should we do?"" I struggled to articulate, a wave of nausea washing over me as I observed the unfortunate creature. Mark scanned the area and located a hefty rock, lifting it above his head.


""We need to end its suffering,"" he gruffly declared, ""you might want to turn away."" I averted my gaze from the injured animal for the first time, and the sound of the rock Mark wielded striking the deer echoed through the air, putting an end to its agony.


""Jesus!"" Mark's exclamation startled me, prompting me to gaze back at the gruesome sight. Instead of a deer's head, all that remained was a flattened mass of flesh, teeth, and brains, with bright purple wriggling worms squirming within the brain tissue. These chubby purple creatures were nestled in the brain matter of the once-vibrant animal, moving their hairy, gelatinous bodies in a dance like they were at a party or in the throes of merriment.


""What in the hell are those?"" I shouted, taken aback by the unnerving sight of the worms. Mark stood there, wide-eyed, shaking his head in disbelief.


""I don't know. Perhaps some kind of parasite? I've heard that deer can contract a parasite that devours their brain, causing them to behave strangely,"" Mark mused. I turned away, unable to stomach the grotesque scene, and vomited, but Mark continued to talk as if oblivious to my distress. ""As for what may have happened, it could have been wolves. Not a bear, though. We don't have those in this area,"" he remarked, finally noticing my vomiting and offering a comforting pat on the back. ""I've made some progress with setting up the tent. Why don't you take a walk and gather firewood while I finish up? It might help you get some fresh air.""


I nodded, still hunched over and wiping away the drool from my mouth. ""Yeah, sure,"" I managed to say through a few more coughs. After ensuring that nothing else was going to come out of my stomach, I forced myself to move away. The nauseating sensation continued to permeate my body, my face flushing with heat and my stomach threatening to empty itself again. My arms felt heavy, and I had to will my legs to keep moving. It was like wading through thick water.

 I couldn't deny Mark's suggestion about those strange purple worms, but they were unlike anything I had ever encountered before. My knowledge of parasites was limited, but it just felt unnatural for something so repulsive and hairy to exist. Mark, being a veterinarian's assistant, had a good understanding of animals.


I recall visiting the clinic one day to have a lunch break with Mark. He introduced me to the doctor he had been assisting, and as soon as Mark spotted me, he hurriedly led me past the waiting room filled with people and their sick pets. We entered the doctor's office, where he introduced us to Doctor Albright. While Doctor Albright seemed friendly enough, the sight of a jar on his desk containing a dog's heart infested with heart worms was quite unsettling. I understood the concept of showcasing the reason behind the work being done, but the display had a disturbing quality that reminded me of scenes from a horror movie. Despite this, the shocking sight of the infected heart paled in comparison to the unsettling creature Mark and I had just witnessed emerging from the deer's head.


My thoughts were abruptly interrupted as I stumbled, my foot catching on a tree root along the edge of the creek. I tumbled to the ground, my head striking a rock. A flash of white light enveloped my vision, prompting me to shut my eyes against the pulsating pain. Tentatively reaching up to touch the point of impact on my forehead, I felt the dampness of a trickle of blood – just what I needed. Opening my eyes, I discovered that I hadn't collided with a rock, but rather a metal surface. Before me lay a sizable square concrete foundation encasing a large metal circular lid, reminiscent of a manhole cover, complete with handles on the sides.


""What in the fuck?"" I muttered aloud, struggling to stand up after the impact that left me disoriented. Bending down, I peered closer at the curious vent opening. Between the handles, which appeared designed for accessing whatever was concealed beneath, was a string of numbers and letters: '17439-HP10-4A'. Instead of clarifying its purpose, this alphanumeric sequence only piqued my interest further, compelling me to reach for one of the handles.


""Are you alright?"" Mark's concerned voice behind me interrupted my contemplation, causing me to turn and motion him over.


""Come take a look at this, I found something."" I called back, gesturing towards the mysterious lid. As Mark approached and observed the unusual opening, a look of bewilderment crossed his face.


""I don't know what it is, but I have a feeling whatever is below is just waiting for us to dive in on an adventure,"" I said with a touch of cheesy excitement. Mark chuckled and playfully rolled his eyes, motioning to grab the handle on the opposite side of me. Without hesitation, I reached out for the handle on my side as we both silently counted down from three, preparing to lift.


The lid was incredibly heavy, causing us to strain and grunt as we attempted to budge the metal covering. I felt a trickle of sweat mix with the blood from  the small cut above my eyebrow, but the adrenaline kept me pushing forward. As we continued to heave the weighty object, it eventually gave way and lifted, leaving Mark and me holding it just a few inches above the opening.


With a final effort, we carefully shifted the cover to the side on the ground, revealing the hidden depths beneath. Peering into the darkness, we both felt a surge of curiosity and anticipation.


In front of us, a gaping hole revealed a stainless steel staircase descending into darkness. The pitch black surroundings made it difficult to make out much  details, but the sunlight above hinted at an arching passageway just past the stairs leading further underground. I caught Mark's eyes, and he returned the silent exchange before gesturing for me to go first.


Turning to my pocket, I pulled out my cellphone and turned on the flashlight, disregarding the lack of service bars on my home screen. Stepping onto the metal staircase, each clang resonated loudly as I descended, Mark's steady steps echoing mine a few paces behind. His phone illuminated the space above my head as we ventured downward.


As I neared the bottom, my light swept over the doorless, expansive hallway, revealing only mundane concrete walls with a peculiar touch of black paint on either side of the entrance. The markings read ""SITE 17439-HP10-4A-A1,"" leaving us to wonder what awaited beyond.


I glanced back at Mark, who had his light fixed on the same lettering, shaking his head in bewilderment like me. Moving down the hallway, the feeble glow from my phone revealed a plain wooden door at the far end, adorned with a glass panel window that hinted at an office beyond, though visibility was scarce. My hand reached for the doorknob just as Mark's voice gave me pause.


""Wait."" I turned to find him standing behind me, the brightness of his phone obscuring his features. ""Maybe we should reconsider. This seems more heavy than we thought,"" he hesitated, ""like it could involve some shady government stuff. I don't want to get mixed up in legal trouble.""


I scoffed, ""Seriously? We've come this far, and besides, look inside."" Gesturing with my phone towards the window, I continued, ""It's just as dark in there as it is out here."" I turned the knob, feeling the door unlatch from the concrete wall. ""This place is deserted. No one knows we're here in the middle of nowhere in buttfuck Georgia, exploring some mysterious underground bunker,"" I declared, already stepping through the doorway.


Surveying the room, the once typical reception area now appeared desolate, as if hastily vacated. The sizable white desk, hosting two now-disconnected computers, had its drawers forcibly yanked open, eerily empty. The towers of the machines had been stripped bare, bereft of their hardware, leaving only hollow shells behind. A noticeable absence of grime on the walls hinted at where frames once held portraits or artworks now absent. Dark hallways stretched into the underground facility from each side, the darkness impenetrable from our vantage point.


 Adjacent to one corridor lay three overturned filing cabinets. Intrigued, I cautiously advanced further into the room, and my steps echoed in the unsettling silence. A damp squelch underfoot drew my attention downwards, and pointing my phone to the floor with my light, I discovered a small pool of a peculiar, gel-like substance. As I tried to lift my foot, the liquid resisted, its surface teeming with tiny, shifting bubbles. Examining my boot, I noticed a similar layer coating the sole, mirroring the bubbling activity beneath. Alerting Mark to the unusual sight, I directed his attention to the odd liquid clinging to my boot, seeking his thoughts.


""What's your take on this?"" I asked, prompting him to abandon the filing cabinets he was standing over and scrutinize the mysterious substance. His response was punctuated by a contemplative hum, suggesting deep thought.


""I dont know. It seems to look like the mucus left by a snail, but I can't be certain. Better not touch it,"" Mark cautioned, his eyes scanning the room for clues. ""I spotted something similar on one of the  filing cabinets, but I sure as hell didnt touch it.""


Directing my phone's light towards the cabinets he mentioned, I asked, ""Did you find anything in there?""


""No,"" he replied tersely. ""There wasn't a single file folder inside. What's even more peculiar is how spotless this place appears, despite its emptiness.""


Mark's observation was astute; the reception area, apart from the strange liquid I had encountered, was unusually clean for an abandoned location. There wasnt any dust, as if it had only been empty a short time, but suddenly a noise emanated from one of the hallways, jolting us from our thoughts. The sound of someone struggling for breath and grunting in pain reverberated through the silent air, prompting Mark to cast me an alarmed glance.


""Someone is still here"" Mark exclaimed urgently. Before I had a chance to reply, he sprinted down the hallway in the direction of the distressing sounds. I followed suit, trying to keep pace with him, but he had a significant advantage in speed, being a track team member back in school.


""Mark, hold on!"" I shouted, struggling to close the gap between us, but his agility outmatched mine, compounded by his initial head start.


""Someone is injured, Luke!"" he called out as he neared the corner where the cries echoed from. Determined to catch up, I pushed myself harder, yet I couldn't reach him in speed.


As I approached, my heart sank at the sight before me. Mark had reached the hallway's corner just as a figure pounced on him from the darkness. He staggered backward, pinned against the wall by the assailant. Drawing closer, I discerned the figure latched onto Mark was a man. His khaki pants drenched in the strange liquid I had encountered, bubbles forming amidst the dampness. His torn lab coat, covered with vomit, revealed the familiar purple worms from those on the deer we saw earlier.


With a desperate gaze, the man peered up at Mark through shattered eyeglasses, one eye infested with wriggling worms protruding from his pupil, waving left and right trying to reach out to Mark.


""Please..."" the stranger pleaded with Mark, who attempted to pull away from his grip. ""We were mistaken. It cannot die. It refuses to let us die"" His voice was chilling, a cacophony of two distinct tones speaking simultaneously. One voice filled with anguish, the other eerily serene. With each word he spoke, more of those grotesque worms spilled out of his mouth and onto Mark's waist. Mark managed to deliver a knee to the man's chest, dislodging his grip, before bolting back in the direction we had come from, grasping my arm in the process.



""GO!"" Mark bellowed, his voice cutting through the air like a knife. Without hesitation, I pivoted on my heels and sprinted after him, my heart pounding in my chest. Behind us, the man's desperate gasps and moans echoed down the corridor. I glanced back  to see the man on his knees, retching up a grotesque mass of worms onto the floor. Tears streamed down his face as he whispered apologies into the darkness, his voice raw with desperation, and those same dual voices.


 There was no time for sympathy as I turned my attention back to Mark, my muscles straining as I pushed myself to keep pace. Just as I thought we might escape, a door swung open with a deafening crash, slamming into my face with brutal force. Agony exploded through my skull as I stumbled backwards, and crashed to the ground just as everything around me went dark. 


As my eyes fluttered open, I was met with a wave of excruciating pain that threatened to consume me. My head pounded relentlessly, my ears rang with a deafening sound. Blood dripped down my face, mingling with my tears as I lay on my back, disoriented and lost.


The surrounding chaos blurred into indiscernible shapes and shadows, but the agonizing cries of wounded animals echoed through the darkness. Staring at the ceiling I could tell I was no longer in the hallway, but in a different room. With a heavy groan, I mustered all of my strength to roll onto my side, only to discover my cell phone lying next to me, its flashlight casting a glow.


Barely able to lift myself to my knees, I grasped the phone and brought it closer to my face. Through the haze, I saw a message displayed on the screen - a cryptic warning was left in the body of a text from myself with no recipient.


 ""Sorry about knocking you out, ""but there's no time. It's loose, and they're coming. Find the key in your pocket, take a left and head for the stairs. I'm already gone, you won't find me. Tell them what you saw.""


As the gravity of the situation sunk in, I realized that I needed to hurry. I groaned more as I pulled myself to my feet. Shining my phone ahead of me to get an understanding of where I was. In front of me was a large metal table, littered with broken vials and scattered papers covered in some kind of chemical. To the left of the table were large kennels stacked on top of each other, I walked over to them I was startled to see the animals that were inside. In one was a brown falcon, laying on its side and flailing its wing and legs, those hairy purple worms were covering its body, digging in and back out of holes covering its body, it's flailing wing had several of them nestled in between its feathers, some of them were flying off with every flap. 


In another kennel, was a small bulldog, dripping out of the mouth with worms, it lunged towards the door of the kennel barking at me trying to break free. Another kennel had another baby deer that was constantly screaming, both its eyes were gone and in its place were just mounds of wriggling, purple hairy worms. I stepped backwards away from the horrible site backing in to the table, my hand bracing on one of the wet pieces of paper on the table. I moved my light over it and could make some of it out, but the chemical poured over it made it difficult to read. 


**The study of (illegible) infestations has taken a terrifying turn as we observe the takeover of hosts by these new entities that grant them incredible strength, dexterity, and an unyielding resistance to conventional forms of (illegible). As the impending threat of human testing looms, ethical concerns abound as we witness the monstrous transformation of subjects into seemingly unkillable beings.


Methods: Subjects were exposed to parasitic infestation through controlled ingestion of contaminated food sources. Observations were made over an extended period to assess the progression of the infestation and its effects on host physiology.


Results: The parasitic infestation led to a nightmarish transformation in hosts, as they exhibited unprecedented muscle growth, enhanced dexterity, and an alarming increase in cell growth that rendered them impervious to traditional methods of treatment. Subjects displayed a terrifying hostility towards researchers and demonstrated a chilling ability to survive lethal doses of eradication attempts.


Discussion: The findings of this study reveal a sinister power within the parasitic entities that take control of hosts, granting them superhuman (illegible) and an unnerving resilience to harm. The ethical implications of continuing such experiments on human subjects are deeply troubling, as the potential consequences of unleashing these monstrous capabilities are beyond comprehension.


Conclusion: The parasitic infestation has unleashed a (illegible) within our research facility, as hosts are transformed into terrifying beings with incomprehensible strength, dexterity, and invulnerability. The looming specter of human testing raises grave concerns about the ethical boundaries we are willing to cross in the pursuit of scientific knowledge. As a researcher haunted by the horrors I have witnessed, I fear the horrors that may be unleashed if we continue down this treacherous path.**


I dropped the soggy paper back down on the table, having an inclination that whoever had written this report may be the person who dragged me into this room. I started towards the open doorway of the room, even more eager than before to leave. I stood in the hallway and recognized the staircase leading up the phone message must have been referring to 50 or so yards to my left, but a wet growling noise to my right caught my attention. Turning around, my heart froze at the sight of a large, humanoid creature clinging to the side of the wall on all fours. 


The purple skinned humanoid creature loomed before me, its labcoat and khakis in shreds and tatters. Its broken frame eyeglasses were askew on its large, yellow, predatory eyes that seemed to pierce through my very soul with a malevolent glow. Its muscular arms and legs were elongated and sinewy, with patches of dark hairs erupting from its sickly violet skin. The creature's bald head was adorned with a writhing mass of long, purple, worm-like tendrils that cascaded down its spine, wriggling and squirming in a grotesque display.


And from its twisted, contorted mouth hung the gruesome visage of my friend Mark's decapitated head, blood still oozing from the severed neck, the lifeless eyes staring blankly ahead. The creature stood there in eerie silence, a nightmarish amalgamation of horror and desolation, its presence sending chills down my spine as I struggled to comprehend the unimaginable sight before me. It opened its mouth and let out another wet growl, dropping Mark's head to the ground in the process. I was no longer frozen in place, it seemed as if my body moved on its own as I turned around and began racing for the staircase.


 I could hear the creature behind me running along the walls in hot pursuit of me. Every fiber of my body screamed in pain as I struggled to run across the concrete ground, hearing the beast pounce from wall to wall in its attempt to catch me, bellowing out an unearthly scream in its frustration. 


My legs seemed to find new strength while I ran up the cold staircase, and I propelled my whole body up into the double door covering that was at the very end of the staircase. Standing once again in the woods of Mount Alto, I looked around for something to keep the doors closed and quickly found a heavy tree branch just laying a few feet away from me. Hurriedly I grabbed it and dragged it back to the doorway and wedged it under the handle of the doors just as the creature threw itself into them causing the doors to budge slightly and the branch crack a little. 


I turned away and started running away along the creek bed, seeing the familiar hill Mark parked on just up ahead. My lungs felt like they were about to explode from the amount I was exerting myself as I passed the metal covering Mark and I used to enter the underground lab, but I couldn't slow down, not even as I passed the fawn we saw earlier, trying to push itself up on its remaining two legs despite not having a lower body or head. 


I fell to my hands and knees hearing the roar of the creature in the distance as I climbed the hill without falling standing up, and throwing myself in to Mark's truck once I made it to the top. I cussed as my nervous hands struggled to turn the key in the ignition, but settled myself once I heard the truck pur to life. As quickly as I could I made a sharp U-turn and began speeding off back to town on the bumpy dirt road that got us here. Along the way, I could hear helicopters above tearing through the sky, but I felt comfortable they couldn't see the truck through the canopy of trees. 


That was three days ago. Despite seeing several strange armored jeeps heading in the direction of Mount Alto, and occasionally seeing helicopters flying overhead in town, there has been complete media silence. I haven't been able to sleep, and I'm afraid of leaving my home. I don't know what was going on in that bunker, but whatever they were working on, is out now.

SR 100% works….from a former disbeliever in a Longterm Relationship ,"You probably read other people's stories and wonder if it's true or BS made up for internet karma points. You google ""is semen retention legit?"" hoping some medical article written by an M.D. (""real science"") will validate your curiosity to try this out. If this sounds like you, fucking stop with the procrastination and DO IT!!

We live in a weird world where men would rather base their opinions of this practice on what an 'expert' funded by dubious sources of money tells them than what their frigging body tells them.

Listen brothers, SR is 100% free and doesn't cost a dime. It takes no time to do and actually saves you a whole lot of it if you're used to PMO regularly. And there's literally 0 health risk of trying SR for 30-90 days. 

So why are you wasting your time looking for articles from 'experts' when you could simply do this free, harmless, time-saving practice for yourself and base your opinion of it on the signals your own mind and body give you? No one knows what is best for you better than you do. I promise if you do SR for 30-90 days, you won't need a single other person to validate anything for you, because your own body's signals will be the ultimate proof.

I've been with my girl for a number of years. I'm past 1 month of SR, now going for 60 days. She has never been attracted to me the way she is right now. She tells me I have changed so much so quickly, in appearance and in personality, and she can't get enough of it.

How have I changed so quickly with SR?

Brighter eyes with a more captivating gaze and the ability to hold eye contact even when there's tension in the air (sexual or other types of tension all included)

Deeper, clearer, louder voice

More emotional energy. I used to get burnt out by arguments or debates quickly, giving in easily because I could feel myself becoming drained. Now it's easy for me to stand my ground and make myself heard, stand up for myself and/or the things I believe in. Women LOVE this in a man. And I no longer feel drained doing it.

Better posture, walking with my head up.

Need less sleep and when I do wake up, I feel ready to go, not like I need a coffee asap.

Able to push myself way harder in physical activities.

Glowing skin.

Much better memory. Able to follow conversations easily and recall information to make insightful comments.

No brain fog.

No more desire to drink or do weed. I'm not necessarily against these things in moderation, but I now only do them when I feel like there's some benefit, not just when I have free time and get the urge.

I have rediscovered a love of reading books and can read and remember things easily.

Everything about my girl seems more attractive to me. I've always found her wildly hot, but when you haven't busted a nut in over a month, every curve, scent, smile, soft touch from her skin sends me off in a way I haven't felt since I started puberty. Obviously, this heightened desire comes out in my now bolder personality, and she loves it.

Tied to the last point, the world in general becomes more colourful, entertaining, *alive*. You see details you didn't before.

I've been losing fat without trying as hard. My face looks more chiselled. It's crazy. I'm not even mewing.

Many more subtle benefits I can't list here without turning this post into a novel.

All of this doesn't even count the spiritual benefits I've felt from pairing SR with a meditative practice and beginning to get in touch with my body in a way I've never experienced before.

I hope this post encourages you, the skeptical lurker, to believe in yourself above all else, and listen to your own body's signals of what is and isn't good for you. You don't need someone with a piece of paper from an educational institute funded by special interest money to tell you *anything* about SR when SR is a free, time saving, risk free practice that you can try for yourself for 30-90 days. I promise at the end of it, you'll know for yourself whether this works or not.

Cheers.

Here's the real difference","Agency owner here. The number of times I've had clients come in asking for ""marketing"" when they really mean ""make me a Facebook ad"" is... well, let's just say I need more coffee for those conversations.

Look, I get it. The lines are blurry. So let me break this down once and for all with a story that changed my entire perspective back when I was starting out.

**Picture a circus coming to town (stay with me, this gets good).**

If you just put up a sign saying ""Circus this Saturday!"" - that's advertising. One piece of the puzzle. A single tool in the toolbox. But here's where people get it wrong...

Marketing? Marketing is the ENTIRE damn show.

It's the mastermind asking:

* Who's our audience? (Families? Thrill-seekers? Date-night couples?)
* What's our angle? (Traditional circus? Modern Cirque-style? Horror theme?)
* Where do they hang out? (Social media? Local papers? Radio?)
* What makes them tick? (Price sensitive? Experience hunters? Instagram-worthy moments?)
* How do we get them talking? (Viral stunts? Influencer previews? Community events?)

Here's a real-world example that happened in my hometown:

The circus didn't just advertise. They created an entire experience. They had their elephant (with a sign, yes - that's the advertising part) walk through town. Classic **promotion**. The elephant ""accidentally"" wandered into the mayor's garden. Local paper ate it up - free **publicity**. Mayor played along - brilliant **PR**. When people showed up, every single interaction was carefully planned - from the booth layout to the staff scripts. That's **sales**.

And the puppet master with the Plan coordinating ALL of these moving pieces? That's **marketing**.

Think of it this way:

* Advertising is one instrument in the band
* Marketing is the conductor making sure every instrument plays its part to create a symphony

EDIT: Since so many are asking - yes, the elephant story is a teaching tool. Please don't send elephants into anyone's garden. My legal team made me add this disclaimer 😅

TL;DR: Marketing is the strategy. Advertising is just one tactic. If you're only doing advertising, you're playing one note in what should be a full orchestra.",2,1729646385.0,EconomicsExplained,0,1.0,False

[SFSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/106) and [Address Library](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/3256)

- Whether you need them right now or not, you will.

[Community Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/1)

- Because it's a BGS game.

[Baka Achievement Enabler](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/658)

- Why not?

[Neutral LUTs](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/323)

- Purely aesthetic, neutralizes most (all?) of the colorful screen space filtering.

[StarUI (Configurator)](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/5467)

- Similar to other BGS games, inventory management and sorting is abysmal, this adds a lot more depth.

- Linked to the Configurator nexus which links to the 5 actual mods on the nexus. The Configurator is a windows app that you can use to change the settings (just double click the ""StarUI Configurator.bat"" file after installing the other mods). Leaving the settings alone works fine too.

[No Scanner Filter\_No Animation](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/11842)

- This turns your entire FOV into the scanner (""stuff"" highlighter) instead of the small 'flashlight' circle. POIs and scanning, etc work the like normal.

- Options to show encumbrance on watch (Awesome!), Color Health bar (Extra Awesome!).

- I got the NSF_SEDWTVW_XPLO_HUD4 (everything) version.

[Shades of Glowy Stuff](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/11818)

- With this set to ""Only When Weapons Drawn"" it acts like a supplemental scanner.

- Highlights containers (that have items), enemies, bodies and valuable stuff (in different colors!).

- Lots of settings and the only mod I have that seems to use the game's built-in settings menu (similar to an MCM). You'll probably want to change a few of the colors.

- Pairs great with the above!

[Compact Mission UI](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/682)

- This simply lets you see more missions in the mission window without scrolling. If a menu takes up half the screen, it should have lots of info.

[Helpful Activity Objectives](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/6081)

- Simply lists the Location next to Activities (mini side quests) in the missions window. Should have been in the base game.

[Individual Resource Tracking](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/7561)

- The built-in research ""track everything and maybe you can't untrack it"" is dumb.

- This lets you track on a component level. The UI is a bit clucky but at least you can track and untrack individual components.

[Crafting Skills from Research](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/9843)

- Probably the first in my list that truly breaks game balance. Spend resources to craft (via research station) certain Skill books instead of using Skill Points.

[TH's Ship Modifications All in One](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/6376)

- Also breaks game balance. Adds a handful of useful ship parts (brake / maneuvering thrusters) and unblocks some limits (multiple reactors or cockpits for instance), cargo capacity becomes 3x by default.

- Might break balance but, imo, fixes immersion... How can a SPACESHIP only carry twice what I can?!?

[Ship Builder Categories](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/7310)

- Required for the above. Similar to FO4's WSFW. Used by other mods to add ship part categories.

[Sit to Add Ship to Fleet](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/6493)

- Simple mod with a prompt to ""Add ship to fleet?"" when you sit at the helm of a commandeered ship (vs the set as home, unset, bleh.. hacky nonsense)

----

Mods I'm considering?

[Galactic Junk Recycler](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/11101?tab=description)

- This looks promising but perhaps buggy as of late? I simply want to pick up and recycle all the junk into 'scrap'. And maybe equipment and weapons as well.

- Several mentions of returning random or no components or just a lot more than a coffee cup should?

- I want to trade equipment easier, be able to assign to tasks (stations?), generic crew have names, more crew, better crew AI, etc. Just improve overall ship / outpost NPC behavior.

- The biggest reason I'm hesitant is I don't much care about NPC looks, in fact, untouched would be great. And looks seem to be the buggiest part of this mod?

**Debt Diary**

I got my first credit card with my first job working at a bank after graduating college (2016). I thought it would be a great way to build up my credit score and I was always good at paying off the balance every single month. I took a new job (2017) and dated a coworker (yikes) where we moved in together after 6 months (also yikes). When he broke up with me in the beginning of 2019, we had upgraded to a new apartment that I was not able to afford without his income. It was in both our names but he walked out. I thought it would be too burdensome to go to a small claims court but I probably should've.

I panicked and started putting everything on credit and decided to ""worry about how I'd pay it back later"". I had some really bad habits mixed in with fear and shame. Sometimes I had a fuck it attitude where I'd just spend because it was already pretty bad. End of 2019, I was around 15k in debt. End of 2022, I was about 40k in debt. 

There was a time by end of 2020 that my rent was going to go up and I decided to move back home. I made a lot of progress not having to pay rent on my debt balances. But my mental health was pretty bad too. A friend asked me to move in with her during 2021. I hadn't totally paid things off yet but I wanted my freedom again.

I also got another new job during 2022 and I finally started making a livable salary ($94k). 

The most embarrassing part of my story and why I have come to reddit instead of telling my friends is I had a get out of jail free card. My grandfather gave my dad $5k when I was born and my dad invested it in stock and only did the DRIP method where the dividends would get re -invested. That $5k in '94 grew to $45k in 2023.

So, when my dad gifted that to me: I wiped out my balance and all was good. I was determined to start fresh with better habits... then a friend asked me to do a last minute vacation, my job had me spot my own travel expenses, I suddenly needed a new wardrobe to attend these conferences and look nice. I did another vacation (though I had budgeted for this one) with some other friends.

At the beginning of this year, I had yet again another $15k in debt. Today, I am $24k in cc debt. This year I am a lot better than I was 5 years ago at handling my expenses though you wouldn't think so looking at these numbers. 

My dad also had given me a car as a graduation gift but asked me in May this year to give it back so he could give to my brother who was having car trouble. I got a dream car, sure, but I felt so much pressure to appear like I had my shit together and be able to swing that without any notice.

I want to get married to my current boyfriend but I desperately do not want to bring any debt into the picture. My boyfriend knows I do have some debt because he helped me talk with the car dealership (the loan is only in my name) but he does not know about the cc debt. We are both in finance and he is pretty good with money so I feel ashamed to even tell him what happened. He does know that I wiped out the original balance and that I'm serious about knowing where and how I'm spending money. 

I have an expense diary that I typically write my daily expenses into and review it both weekly and monthly. I have been consistent with that practice all year! Which is the first time I've actually stuck with it. 

**Reflection**

My plan is to get a new job, hopefully start to make $130k. My rent is going to go down to $1300 a month in January and my bf won't make me pay for internet or electric. He also likes to cover most food expenses, including the dog food and any new house things like furniture or bedding. 

I know I am so lucky to be dating him. 

I have always contributed at least 10% to my retirement. In 2023, I contributed the max to a 401k. This year I decided to contribute nothing to focus on paying down my debt but I had unexpected and expensive things happen every single month.

On a whim, my boyfriend wanted to go on a trip and I didn't want him to pay for everything even though he was more than happy to.

On another whim, a friend wanted to come visit for a long weekend and so that meant a lot of shopping and eating out.

I had my own medical expenses and some pretty high vet bills this summer even though we are both insured.

I have paid all of those experiences off!! But I haven't been able to get past simply maintaining.

I also spent $5k (that I afforded by using my cc) this summer to up-level my skills and get certified as a product manager. I justified it by saying my new job would help cover it with the new salary.

\^I was so embarrassed that I had fallen off track and off the maintenance I was able to hold that I definitely overspent the following month. 

I am determined to get out of this holding pattern. I've looked at my future numbers and I'd have like $2k a month remaining even if I don't get the new job to start attacking my debt while also not changing my variable expenses.

If I get the new job, that remaining balance is above $3k. 

I'm writing this because I can't help but feel like I'm trying to make the right changes and do the right thing but Idk if it's my pride or wanting to appear like I have things together or that I truly CAN pay for things when I can't.... 

I don't like the idea of cutting back (who does lol) when I don't feel like my daily expenses are that high to begin with. I feel like $500 on groceries, $500 on leisure, and $500 on myself are well within reason. I don't want to be a frugal girlie eating only maruchan breakfast, lunch, and dinner :< so if you think it makes sense for me to cut back somewhere, please give me this advice and I will do my best to listen. 

  
Thank you for any  comments <3 I really hope that my daily efforts can show through so that I can change for the better. Thank you ",10,1729645906.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,4,0.78,False

We just got a breville dual boiler and having trouble getting anything good out. Hoping everyone could help me troubleshoot!
1. Grind: went to (good) local coffee shop and they ground beans for me since I don't think our home grinder is good enough for now - planning to upgrade but debating what.

2. Beans - from same place, medium roast espresso they recommended

3. I measure out 18-19g of beans and tamp only after making sure it's relatively flat
Note: Using a single wall (?) basket in the portafilter - it came with some dual wall ones too but not sure what to use here

4. Pre infusion is auto for 7 seconds

5. Then espresso starts coming out after (200 degree F water) but it comes out VERY fast - I am measuring the output weight too and I am getting 50g+ of liquid in 5-10 seconds...

6. The pressure never hits 8-10 bars like it's supposed to - stays only at the pre infusion 1/2 bars level the entire pull

Then it tastes real bad haha Any idea what I should be changing?

I tested running a blank puck with this plastic / rubber disc and it hits 8-10 pressure bars easily - also when I use a dual wall basket it improves to 6-7 but still not all the way. I thought originally my grinds weren’t fine enough, hence why I went to the coffee shop - but having same issue with what they ground for me earlier this afternoon. And ran a cleaning cycle on machine etc to clear out pipes even though it’s basically brand new. Not sure what I am doing wrong!

Background: We have a large piece of property in a highly trafficked area in our (small, rural) downtown area. A lot of people pass thru on their way from other towns. Our property also backs up to a very popular trail for biking, snowmobiling, etc. and it brings in people from all over. 
We will be renovating our building over the next several years and want to test out how a coffee/hot drinks/simple breakfast menu would do. My friend will let us use her food trailer this winter/spring (her business is seasonal during summer months). 

I can see how great this would be for our small area (where getting quick meal is pretty much nonexistent, let alone healthy options). I’ve talked to a lot of people who live in the next town and commute thru there and have a lot of good feedback!

I am wondering what the best way to place orders is. Since it will be winter time in Michigan, I can’t imagine we could keep the big window open all the time. Maybe an app with scan QR code, designated parking spots, curbside pick up / food runner to car?
Is it important to have that “face to face” though?
Maybe an “open” sign, lights or flags indicating it’s taking orders. 

I think weekdays will mostly be car traffic and it can’t have an actual drive thru. What’s the next best option?

Weekends will have a lot of snowmobile traffic. So I’d like to do some fire pits, seating, porta potty. Possibly a warming tent if it becomes possible. 

I’ve done light research on permits in my area. I have other commercial buildings so I’ve gone thru kitchen inspections before. That is all do-able. Food will be prepared off site at our event venue/commercial kitchen. 

I have someone in mind I am going to approach about running it but I want to have the general concept figured out. 

I’d love any input!!!

Five years ago I took a job that moved us away from friends to a much larger city that we thought would be full of people and opportunities. Although I love my job, it has been really difficult on my husband. I know he feels alone and isolated, but he has also been battling anxiety, making it nearly impossible for us to go out and meet people or experience fun things. 

Maybe 7 years ago, I fucked up. An old friend messaged me out of the blue. Our text messages started as just friends, but then he started getting flirty. At one point he convinced me to send him a picture of me in a bikini. It was inappropriate and absolutely crossed a boundary. My husband found out and was rightfully pissed. I realized how inappropriate I had been. I blocked that dude and haven't repeated any behavior close to that since. I truly love my husband and do not want to hurt him.

Fast forward to now. He still doesn't trust me, especially when his intrusive thoughts start creeping in. I constantly scrutinize my own action to determine if I'm going to make my husband suspicious. But I've decided his anxieties are for him to deal with, so I've let my guard down. I bought some new clothes after getting a bonus at work (plus gaining weight and generally needing some new clothes). I've been taking on new responsibilities that sometimes result in me deviating from my regular telework schedule. I've made a new friend who I enjoy occasionally spending time with. Most recently a colleague visited Japan, and I asked him to bring me coffee from a popular roaster, which he did and I paid him for. But all this, in my husband's mind, adds up to me sneaking around. 

I do my best to support my husband. He's started working for himself, and he's building his own farm. I've been supportive of these changes. I want to help him realize his dreams. I spent 7 hours helping him shovel compost this weekend because I love him. 

But I don't know what to do about this distrust. I think he needs to see someone about his anxiety. All his suspicion is in his head, but that seems like a really cruel thing to say to someone when they're voicing their concerns of infidelity. So is marriage counciling the answer? He knows all my computer and phone passcodes. I don't keep my messages hidden. I just don't know what to do. 

TL;DR my husband thinks I'm cheating on him because too many things have changed recently. I don't know how to prove that I'm being faithful.",7,1729644899.0,relationships,36,0.61,False

I have most of my creature comforts (literally, my dog, who loves to snuggle next to me), coffee, tea, easy enough food, a great home office, etc., and I’ll pick up a bottle or two of pinot noir tomorrow.

What could make it a little extra special though? I’m sure you all will have ideas. Please share!

Her name is Olivia and her husband's name was Mark. He got there earlier than her and popped over after he voted to check in. They're originally from Oregon.

I had so much fun chatting and we seemed to have similar interests. I'm a work from home mom so it's hard to meet new people and Olivia was so much fun to talk to. I'd love to meet for coffee and chat more! 

I hope this is enough info to somehow find her! I was the overexcited woman with red curly hair in heeled boots for an hour plus wait to early vote!

Edited to add: I'm not involved in any MLMs, so this isn't a recruitment post. I just really had a great time chatting!",79,1729644360.0,nashville,0,0.93,False
1g9xvdf,https://www.reddit.com/r/phmigrate/comments/1g9xvdf/pte_exam_tips/,PTE EXAM TIPS,"I just got my PTE Results a day ago, and got a score of 84/90. I just wanted to share a few tips:

1. Make sure you practice your speaking skills no matter how good of an English speaker you are. I speak a fair amount of English (I used to work as a freelance writer) and still had to practice for a day or two. It's the nerves that's going to get you, so you have to know how to attack the Speaking Test properly. 

2. The testing center is going to be pretty darn noisy during the exam, because all of the test takers are going to be speaking at the same time. It's best if you practice speaking in a noisy environment without getting out of focus. I practiced Speaking for about an hour in a busy coffee shop, and sure enough, the exam center was just as loud. 

3. APEUni. I paid for a month's worth of their premium, but was only able to do mock tests for about 2 days, because I still had to go to work. And will get knocked out immediately after work. I suggest you do mock tests as much as you can. The exam is pretty similar to their mock tests.

4. Don't overthink it. It's an easy test, especially if you already have a good English background. If you don't, you can just study a week or two more.
