I would like your takeaways since maybe you are here in this more I would like a general overview, possibly with scientific research for example in these aspects:

\- Foods (what foods other than processed foods that I already avoid generally can cause estrogen and lower T levels? What about coffee?)

\- Water (i drink from water bottles since I am born, how to detoxify and alternative solutions?)

\- Lifestyle (what lifestyle choiches are better ? For example is more effective running other than for example biking, just your takeaway, maybe masturbation can interfere with T?)

\- People (socially drinking, type of people to be around with, how to behave, other sex relationships and so on)

\- Hobbies (hobbies to suggest?)",1,1732277927.0,Testosterone,1,1.0,False

1gx6beh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1gx6beh/nothing_is_getting_better/,Nothing is getting better,"I lost a job with a company I worked for and helped make a lot of money for for 10 years on my 10th anniversary with them.

I also have my own brand and we took a serious hit to our sales post pandemic that never came back.

The way I got let go was shady, and I prayed and was left with no other way than to address it in court which I won, but barely enough to cover my salary for a year and a half, and I’d already been out of work for almost a work when the case was resolved.

I’ve been trying to just believe as though I’ve received it and looked forward with joy to new opportunities, new leads new prospects, and hold up my end of the bargain. 

I’ve looked for work, and ever widened my scope, lowered the bar, left myself open to all types of work, and prayed for opportunities to serve his kingdom and seek it.

I’ve tried not to worry and cast my cares on him. 

I’ve continued to work at the coffee ministry and greeting for the team at my church up until recently. 

I keep praying to please get help to replace my income that I was receiving, and or to help restore my brand sales from before the pandemic, or something new entirely, just anything. 

I’m now 50,000 dollars in my savings down and nothing has changed for the better 

If I’m patient nothing changes
If I’m active trying to find work nothing changes 
If I believe as though I’ve received it nothing happens 
If I’m sad and tell God it’s breaking my heart to get help nothing happens
If I’m mad and tell him to go f*** himself, nothing happens. 

I don’t like being upset with God, and I’m trying to stay in a good spot, but I’m very hurt and feel very betrayed and I’m to the point that I just don’t feel like I can trust him for help.

No matter how good my attitude is nothing happens. 
No matter how dire the situation is nothing happens

I pray for wisdom and nothing happens
I pray for help and nothing happens.
I’m patient and nothing happens

I have been praying for my income to please get back on track, for prospects, for leads and open doors, and nothing happens. 

I feel betrayed and hurt and this is not the God that I know and love. 

For a year straight this has been my life and I’m just about done. 

I’ve thought about killing myself because where would I go, to a heaven with a God that’s turned his back on me? Wander as a ghost? That seems worse than this. 

But I don’t think that would even matter because nothing I do seems to make anything better and I’m brokenhearted and livid about it. 

It was bad enough to get betrayed by a company that I worked with for 10 years, but if God is just going to join in on screwing me over then we’ve all really got a problem.

Nothings being added to me.
Nothing is being worked out in my favor
Nothing is getting better.

I quit my coffee ministry and quit going to church for a while until things get better because I just can’t handle being trolled with a bunch of fake promises betrayals of my trust. 

Usually I can blame or see clearly that something awful is the enemy’s attacks, and God is my refuge. 

But this time… who is to blame? 
Are my prayers a volleyball that the devil can jump up a spike away from God? That seems like unscriptural bullshit. 

Where does my help come from? 

Am I just an idiot for continuing to try a hope God will come through for me and help me? 

No matter what I do nothing changes and I am angry and hurt and very confused.

Without God what is my life?

I have very real bills, I have a Mom with Cancer,  she has a house I need to help fix, I have rent, and need very specific help in finding a replacement for my income, and I have nothing but a living God who has chosen to do nothing. 

He might say he’ll never leave or never abandon me, but if all he does is stand and watch as my life goes to shit then I’m really at a loss.

No matter what I do, or stand firm in my faith, and not worry, and not lean on my own understanding….. nothing is getting better. 

He might never leave me and never forsake me, but nothing getting better and he’s not helping in a way that I can tell…so what’s the point? 

Nothing is getting better. ❤️‍🩹 

What do I do?

I was sick and wanted to eat soup and toast in my room. He didn't like that and yelled at me to eat downstairs and then came to my room and started yelling at me more. I continued to eat and he refused to leave despite me asking. I threatened to throw soup (it was cold because he was arguing with me for so long) at him if he didn't leave. He dared me to and so I did. Then he reached over and slapped me twice, on each side of my face.

My partner said ""That's enough, get out,"" or something along those lines.

I pushed him off me and pushed him out of the room. I am very short - 148.5cm and like 45kg, my dad is maybe just under 6 foot and he's quite big as well.

My partner helped me to push him out of my room. My partner is 6 foot and like 80kg.

And then just before my dad left my room, he shoved me hard against the wall. My partner pushed harder. Then my dad said, ""I'm going, I'm going.""

I was crying and I called the police straight away. He never really physically abused me. He did to my brother (who is trans) and to my mum. It wasn't constant, it would suddenly happen. The first I can remember was when I was 6 and my dad broke my mum's phone and hid it under the coffee table. I didn't see it happen but the next day my mum, brother, and I were going to the town centre and my mum couldn't find her phone. And then she found it under the coffee table.

My dad was/is physically abusive to my brother. He stuffed socks in his mouth and made him take adult sized paracetamol or something when my brother was 7. He also slapped him and pressed a house key hard into my brother's hand in recent years.

Leading up to this incident, my dad and mum argued about my brother's room (my dad did some renovations that were not appreciated despite me warning him to consult my brother first). He grabbed her and wouldn't let her go. I ran downstairs and prised him off her. He was calling her names, the words he always used to yell at all three of us: horrible being one of them.

I always asked my mum to divorce him since I was 11. He was only really verbally abusive to me and started targeting me more in the months leading up to that. He never was physical with me. I was the only one who could really talk to him as well. My brother and mum were impatient with him but I learned at school counselling how to communicate with him, if not for his sake, for mine.

On the 26th or 27th or 28th of December (2022), he was very angry at me for not making the dessert. He accused me of doing it out of malice or as some sort of plan. But I didn't do it because nobody wanted any. And if anyone did, it would have been easy to do because it was ice cream with meringue, cream, and fruit and not something you had to make beforehand like a cake.

He slammed down a bowl of food in front of me and my mum intervened. My partner was there as well.

A lot had happened before all this. My mum's dad died in July 2022 I think, the years are all hazy. And I was sick for half a year and had to take a leave of absence from my university course and defer for a year. I had severe eczema and was housebound.

Before that, I had met my partner and I think the dynamic in my family was changing since I started becoming more independent and had friends I would go and see that weren't from school. I also started drinking in 2020. I have stopped since due to my health but I used to come home drunk every now and then. It was not good.

Back to May 2023 and the police came. My dad already called my mum, calling me ""rebellious."" (I didn't actually hear it, my partner told me the other day because we were talking about it). The police recorded stuff and my dad made me hand over my house key and I brought my passport with me.

The police took me and my partner to my friend's house and it was there I texted my mum and told her what my dad did. I apologised for calling the police. My mum called me disrespectful and ungrateful. That broke me because I thought she would stand up for me. I always protected her and my brother and she didn't want to protect me.

My partner and I stayed in another friend's house but my friend's grandma was very verbally abusive, probably because of dementia but she has always been mean. She accused me of lying about silly things and was unhappy about how I was not following their house ""rules"" and that I was not ""normal.""

I'm 23 now. My partner and I moved to a different borough. We're now in a different place but in the same borough. Work is rocky, we haven't had much luck in finding something we want to do and are working part time retail jobs whilst trying to study/do work in what we want.

For a while, my dad's friend, who used to live with us when I was growing up and I saw him as more of a paternal figure than my own dad, was helpful. But he kept asking me to reach out to my mum.

After I left, it seems that my mum, dad, and brother had a rough time. My dad got involved in some investment scam and was about to sell the house to put more money in the scam. They lost £350,000. He took out seven loans in my mum's name without her knowing (it started after I left, when she went to visit her family in another country). From what my brother told me, my dad coerced my mum into ""investing"" and my brother came home to find some scammer controlling the home computer with my mum at the computer telling him where to go or something.

I tried to help. I said to my mum it was financial abuse and she should get the loans written off that way. But she wanted to go to the FCA and get the money back by siding with my dad and saying he was scammed. Though both are true, he willingly took out loans under his own name (as well as under my mum's) so I thought the former option was better. But I guess she didn't want to go against my dad.

My dad's friend told me my mum was suicidal. I told her that she and my brother are welcome to come and stay where I was living with my partner. To be in a safe place. I asked if she wanted to meet and I said I can send her money. But she would only meet if my dad could come as he was threatening to kill himself.

Christmas 2023 I sent my mum and brother presents but I sent it to her work. In an error, I sent it to her previous work because I forgot she switched jobs (a lot happened when she changed jobs, it was when her dad died and I was sick). She got very angry with me and sent me some awful messages. I explained it was a mistake and that I sent it to her work and not to her home because sometimes people aren't home all the time (but also because I didn't trust my dad as he would open our post, I didn't mention this though).

I blocked her and I haven't heard from her since.

My brother - we were very close. We enjoyed a lot of the same things and we had a small age gap. I protected him so many times from my dad. He's 18 months older than me but isn't very mature or independent. I tried to encourage him to move out into a house share with his friends after university as he has quite a lot of savings due to student loans and living at home but he was never confident enough.

I haven't told them I moved places or that I have a new job. I haven't been talking to my dad's friend because I'm paranoid that he's just leaking information to my parents. I wouldn't mind my mum so much but I do not want my dad knowing.

Now to my questions:

- I keep wondering if I made the right choice in leaving?
- I miss my mum a lot (we were like best friends growing up). What do I do? Because I know I can't force her to do anything or change her mind about involving my dad. If I was certain my dad would not be involved, there would be no question - I would be meeting my mum regularly (if she wanted to of course)
- I feel betrayed. I protected my brother and mum growing up the best I could, arguing with my dad on behalf of them, physically separating them, sending my dad downstairs and telling him to cool off. Now they don't want to protect me. If it was the reverse, I would be sending, at the very least, money to my brother and would be meeting with him regularly. Am I wrong to feel this?
- I keep thinking about it and I don't like it because my thoughts aren't going anywhere.
- Should I be trying to build bridges with mum? My dad? People keep asking me about it, if I've talked to them. And most who do have the inclination that I should be talking to them or have some sort of relationship.
- How do I stop feeling sad about it? I played the piano at home (at my parents I mean, I still call it home which I know is wrong) and I only just bought a keyboard for where I live. I am sad about all that I missed because I was displaced.
- I feel betrayed and let down by the people around me. I feel betrayed by my school because I was on counselling and they knew my dad was not nice. I feel let down by my friend whose house I stayed at because they haven't been in touch for a long time since I moved from their house.
- I feel lonely. Nobody seems to understand what I'm going through. Nobody in my life anyway.

I'm sorry this is long. It's been on my mind a lot. I can't afford therapy right now (there's the NHS but when I tell them I have EUPD they say they can't help me). I've been wanting to share this for a while and get some advice but it's been hard.

It worked within a few days was coming in my room randomly kissing me. Whilst casting the spell I put a deadline on when I wanted to see the effects by which was Halloween. On Halloween that when I really good the effects!! He randomly started sending me very kinky teasing messages of what he would like to do to me and more, we started doing theses things and was getting closer! This lasted antil Monday 😢 get got want to say freaked out cause his feelings was coming back was opening up about the past extra and then ended the whole message thing saying I don’t want to give you the wrong idea. I dont think I was very pacific in the spell as but what I asked for did come true for my sp to be clingy, obsessed, jealous of me. He was very jealous on many actions and all the rest. So I’m going to do a different jar tomorrow still dominating him but a do as I say jar and be more pacific telling him to commit to me, love me extra. 

The jar I did: 
Did it on a Friday by getting my morning wee I put it into a clean jar and hide it away antil the evening. I used catnip, coffee, lavender, rose petal, cinnamon and a baby leaf with his name on burnt it and put the ashes in the jar. I wrote his name DOB on some paper also what I wanted and folded towards me. I got his used boxers and cut it wear the crutch is put the paper in there and again rolled it up towards me and put that in the jar then topped with all the herbs and my wee. Closed the jar and popped a red tea candle on top with his name caved in it. Lit the candle used my energy and said I ask the gods and goddesses of love to grant me this gift that sp will be obsessed, clingy in love and jealous of me! I ask the gods and goddess of love to give me the power and strength to do this spell and see effects by Halloween this is my will so mote it be. I let the candle burn down then hide in a dark place every other day I would then redo a red candle on top and say my intentions again and did that for 2 weeks. The urine and month on now has nearly got absorbed in the pants so probably why it’s not as effective now.

1gx60lb,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFapChristians/comments/1gx60lb/day_fourteen/,Day Fourteen,"Not to be a nag, but you gotta get rid of the porn. 

If I have access to porn, I’m gonna look. Men are visually driven, it’s a survival instinct, it’s a mating cheat code women use to attract men, and that has been perverted. It’s always been perverted — this is nothing new. I use my will power to get me by ordinary circumstances like the woman at the gym dressed provocatively, or the young lady at the coffee shop. But having access to porn or near porn is a definite no-no. 

That sort of access saturates and super charges my already eager lust. I have a difficult time keeping my thoughts pure at the grocery store. When I’m porning out, it’s all over. That leads to all sorts of sexual sin, acting out. But remember where it started. When I’ve denied myself access to porn, my lust is relatively weak and puny and easily silenced. 

You’re not going to make any progress until you restrict the porn. 

Oh Fred, how about I pray for self-control? Won’t that do it? 

My Toyota has very specific instructions on how often and what type of oil I use when I change the oil. And I follow those instructions or risk ruining the engine — which makes the car pretty much worthless. 

Jesus gave you and I specific instructions as well in this same manner. Speaking specifically on sexual sin, Jesus commanded you and I to cut off and cast away those things that cause us to sin. No one ever argues with me on this point. Our “Manufacturer” lays it out clearly.

A *BFCM Mastermind Sale Strategy* where customers leave your store thinking, *""Wait, how did I spend THAT much?!""*

https://preview.redd.it/t3bunza9wf2e1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=863139918abb0d10839c178f11811199aa6497cf

Here’s how you, dear eCommerce wizard, can pull it off with some good ol’ upselling magic. **And don’t worry—this isn’t salesy at all (wink).** 

# Step 1: The Order Bump Ambush (A.K.A. ""Impulse Buy Trap"")

Picture this: your customer is peacefully adding their $20 gadget to the cart. Suddenly—BOOM!—an irresistible deal pops up.  
*""Add this $10 premium charger—originally $30—for a seamless experience!""*

Now, they’re not just buying; they’re investing. **(Stats say 60% of buyers grab order bumps like candy—why not yours?)**

**Pro Tip:** Keep it small. A $5-$15 add-on works wonders. Ask too much, and they'll abandon faster than free Wi-Fi in a dead zone.

# Step 2: The One-Click Wonder (Upselling, But Make It Easy)

Your customer just paid $100 for an amazing coffee maker. Nice! But wait—you whisper:  
*""Before you go, how about these premium coffee beans at 20% off? Just one click, and it’s yours.""*

Sounds simple, right? That’s because **70% of post-purchase offers convert better than pre-purchase ones**. It’s psychology 101—people love “finishing” their buying experience with a bang.

# Step 3: The BFCM “Oh No, We’re Running Out!” Drama

Urgency sells. **Use timers, FOMO, and “last chance” alerts** like your life depends on it.  
Example:  
*""This exclusive coffee combo is flying off the shelves. Literally. We just saw one grow wings.""*

# Step 4: The Confusion Game

Keep your upsells random—but aligned.  
Customer buys a bike? Offer a helmet. Or...a bell? Wait, no—how about a GPS tracker? **Keep them guessing**; the element of surprise drives conversions. (It’s science, trust me.)

# Bonus: Gamify Your Sale!

Throw in a secret BFCM roulette wheel—*“Spend $50, spin to win 10%-30% off your next purchase!”*  
Because nothing says “I need this” like a spinning wheel with fake confetti.

**Moral of the Story?**  
BFCM is like karaoke night—you need rhythm (timing your offers), charm (killer product combos), and confidence (just GO for it). With upsells and bumps, you’re not pushing; you’re guiding. **And your customers?** They’ll thank you when their cart screams, *""Wow, what a deal!""* 😏

**Paladin-** Trained in Perion, feels very out of place in Perion, quietly wishes he tried out to be a Cygnus knight. It's difficult climbing up all those ropes, and every new, heavier set of armor makes the situation worse.

**Dark Knight-** Rejected applicant to the ""curse survival club"". Turns out his magic isn't even dark magic. It's just purple. He applies mascara every morning.

**Dawn Warrior-** Milhe does not like the Dawn Warrior, because the Dawn Warrior took his basic teachings and invented an entirely new, more powerful way of fighting. Milhe pretends to be happy when the Dawn Warrior gets awards.

**Milhe-** The hot stuff before the new generations of Cygnus Knights, currently badmouthing his subordinates to Empress Cygnus to keep his job. Will literally jump in front of attacks not only to save people, but also to stand out. His accent slips when he's flustered.

**Blaster-** Vocally amazed every time an attack doesn't cause tremendous self harm. Legitimately ready to blow up at a moment's notice, for the cause of course. Nobody in the Resistance assumes that Blaster is disposable, except Blaster.

**Demon Slayer/Avenger-** When the dust settles and everything goes back to normal, him and Mercedes are going to have long, passive aggressive arguments about interior decorating and table manners.

**Aran-** Legitimately the Black Mage does not know she exists. She assumes her curse was personal, and takes it real hard when she learns that Mercedes' random village also got frozen. Unlike every other hero, she has literally nothing to do besides fighting, so defeating the black mage is honestly a big sacrifice play for her and her career prospects.

**Kaiser-** Shamelessly cringe in a way that nobody in the Maple World really understands. The peak zoomer option.

**Adelle-** Warriors reject her as a warrior, mages reject her as a mage, Adelle is trying very hard to be above it all but she's a little upset that she's not allowed in the Perion Warrior sanctuary. She saw a man with bombs strapped to his hands walk in there like it was nothing.

**Zero-** Every resident of the Maple World recognizes Alpha and Beta as clones of the two mushrooms in the Mushroom Castle that look like them. Some have slipped up and called them Gamma and Omega by mistake.

**Hyato-** Doesn't actually notice that he's in another world until someone tells him, since he's not acknowledged supernatural things as supernatural so far. People tell him he's teleporting and he doesn't believe them.

**Fire/Poison-** Only advanced magicians can tell that Fire/Poison's magic smells nasty. The strongest magicians can shut the nasty smell out. Fire/Poison has gone noseblind.

**Ice/Lightning-** The star student of the magic library that makes everyone else look bad. Not actually the smartest of them.

**Bishop-** The actual smartest of them. There's a debate on whether you die every time you teleport. Bishop knows for a fact that you do, and there's a delay before your soul catches up with your body. She teleports frequently to chase that high.

**Blaze Wizard-** Most of their missions involve cleaning up whatever Oz did in her last mission. Given no skills besides fire, it's everyone else's job to clean up the Blaze Wizard's clean up.

**Battle Mage-** The only mage to accept Adelle as a mage. Also the only mage to personally kneecap someone in the street. Nobody wants to look the battle mage in the eyes.

**Evan-** Distinct from Freud in that Freud would solve low tech problems in high tech ways. Evan solves high tech problems in low tech ways. Second of the heroes to suggest ""What if we just break it?"" after Aran. Aran wants to adopt him as a little brother.

**Luminous-** Assumed he would become the next transcendent when the Black Mage died. Raw panic is setting in when he realizes who the next most likely candidate is.

**Illium-** Absolutely freaked out when he looked in the mirror and realized he got an involuntary haircut when he awakened. Wore hats for months afterwards until he finally learned to accept it. Assumes magic aged him because his hair wasn't white before.

**Lara-** Can heal curses. Other classes flee from her in fear since she can take away their primary source of power with a sound. Pathfinder gets a nosebleed whenever she's around.

**Kinesis-** The next transcendent after the black mage. Luminous is terrified of him. Kinesis doesn't even know what a transcendent is, but he's been feeling pretty strong lately. Maybe he can toss the entire Nautilus now.

**Kanna-** Stares at her money every time she goes through a portal because she realized her Ming Dynasty money (what the Japanese used in the warring states period due to instability of local currency) changed into Mesos the moment she crossed over. She questions everything that's going on, to compensate for Hyato.

**Lynn-** Has a personal apology letter for every single older character for something she did in her past life. She's also the only person who remembers Shade prior to the Black Mage dying, but she can't tell him because she's mortified about a past transgression.

**Bowmaster**\- Athena Pierce's third best student (of three). Compensates by shooting an awful lot. Was thrilled when the pathfinder got cursed, then they turned into homing arrows and Bowmaster nearly retired. The only character that Lucid will absolutely not fight.

**Marksman-** Athena Pierce's second best student and the Friendstory protagonist. Sneaks into Seoul every morning to buy more coffee. Does Athena Pierce's paperwork when she's out, trains new recruits, and generally does not have time off.

**Pathfinder-** Athena Pierce's best student, but because she's a natural, not because she tries very hard. Recent member of the ""curse survival club"". The only non mage who thinks the fire/poison wizard smells bad.

**Wind Archer-** Gives off the vibe of a gentle, nature loving pacifist. Secretly a protein nut, trying to keep up with his insane instructor. Looks longingly at the Thunder Breaker squad every morning before heading off to another day of absolute hell. 

**Wild Hunter-** The resistance jaguar gathering operation is exceptionally hard to manage. The black wings absolutely knows that someone's been buying copious amounts of raw meat. When the wild hunter finally reveals herself, Gelimer's first words would be along the lines of ""ohh, that's why.""

**Mercedes-** Doesn't actually know her students by name. She forgot Lucid was even there due to her tight schedule, until it came back to bite her.

**Kain-** Thought dragons just looked like normal people, so when he sees anyone with red eyes, he assumes they're also a dragon. He has absolutely no reference for what a dragon actually looks like.

**Night Lord-** Saw that Hero got to pick his own job title. Also picked his own job title. Assumed it would make him more popular with the ladies than it did.

**Shadower-** Knows slightly too much about the interior of different species. They aren't evil but like... if the world was different and they were given different opportunities, they could have picked either side.

**Dual Blade-** Hates the title ""thief"", since he believes he's as much a warrior as any warrior. Introduces his full name before every fight, as well as the names that he gave both of his weapons. Some bosses appreciate the gesture. Zakum is nonplussed.

**Night Walker-** The Cygnus postal system and information gathering system all in one. In wartime, she functioned as an assassin, and an effective one at that. In peacetime, she's considering new employment.

**Xenon-** Got jumped at the maple alliance because he looked like Lotus, more than once. The black bowl cut was a conscious effort to distinguish himself more. He used to commiserate with the VR Lotus before it blew up.

**Phantom-** Has a thing for royal blondes, but never felt anything for Mercedes. Mercedes doesn't like him either, but she's sorta self-conscious why she was so left out.

**Cadena-** Quietly wishes she could participate in the snooty manners conversations with Mercedes and the Demon Slayer. Instead she's stuck at the warrior table with everyone just cramming their faces and she has to pretend that she's okay with that. She swears, but she swears like a sheltered 12 year old trying it for the first time, and winces when she does it.

**Khali-** Still wears the royal guard uniform after leaving the royal guard, not because she's loyal, but because she's cocky and she wants to be recognized at a glance when she comes back and just wipes everyone out. Leaves a trail of sand wherever she goes.

**Hoyoung-** Literally has no idea the black mage is even a thing, and assumes that the black mage is the Dark Knight. The Dark Knight sheds tears of joy upon hearing this.

**Buccaneer-** A tremendously effective martial artist. The only pirate class with active seasickness since his combat style relies on a strong stance. Not very into this ""pirate"" thing as a gimmick, more or less just wants to meditate and fight.

**Corsair-** The hero that will kill the Black Mage, not because she's the strongest, but because she's the only one with the leadership chops to get all these idiots to work together. Barely passed every single class advancement test.

**Cannoneer-** Has long talks with the monkey about explosive powder. It is unclear if he's joking or serious. Lynn knows it's a joke.

**Thunder Breaker-** Doesn't wear the Cygnus Knights uniform, because neither does her boss. The only Cygnus Knight with a longstanding invite to their base. She earned that privilege by getting into a fistfight with every single leader of the resistance.

**Mechanic-** Crippled from being shot by Gelimer. The robot is not optional at all. The robot is a requirement to do anything more than limp around.

**Shade-** Long-standing crush on Aran, he's been using his curse to make her forget him when he jumps between dimensions to try different approaches. The Black Mage was killed on a particularly bad attempt and he's trying to pick up the pieces.

**Angelic Buster-** She starts at level 10 because she's actively resisting the cringe. As she embraces the cringey outfit and music, she becomes more powerful up to level 200. Kaiser would have been level 200 immediately.

**Arc-** Really assumed people would treat him like a monster until he realized that his deformity wasn't even in the top 10 weirdest conditions in the Maple World. He's sort of fighting with a mix of angst at his condition and angst that he's not extraordinarily haunted.",2,1732275437.0,Maplestory,0,0.66,False

","# That means luxury living is not just the visual appeal of a house but a need to come up with spaces that marry functionality, elegance, and convenience. Among the core components of any modern house is the kitchen, and with luxury modular kitchen designs unveiling in the modern world, many homeowners are looking for innovative ways to make their kitchens stylish and smart.

# A [luxury modular kitchen](https://wurfel.in/modular-kitchen-design.php) is not just a sophisticated look but a perfect combination of superior materials, modern design, and high-tech benefits for creating a beautiful, yet highly functional space. These kitchens follow the modular conception prevalent in European countries and meet the needs of contemporary living while utilizing all of one’s space to the fullest. In this blog post, we dive deep into the art of luxury living as we take a close-up look at marvelous modular kitchen designs and smart features that change the way one can cook, dine, and live. 1. Luxury Modular Kitchen Designs: Elevating Style and Function

# Luxury modular kitchens exist in an altogether different league, because they bring together style and function with effortless beauty. A modular kitchen is a pre-designed unit or module that can be adapted to fit your space and lifestyle. This provides flexibility, organization, and a clutter-free environment that adds merit to the pleasure of cooking and to the aesthetic appeal of your home.

**a) European Modular Kitchen Inspiration**

Modular kitchens of Europe : it is the gold standard when the matter in question is about high design for high-end homes. What makes them sleek and minimalist will be their readiness and utility of storage space to all possible smart solutions towards all types of space savings. Inspired by European designs, kitchens with handleless cabinets, integrated appliances, and open shelving create an aesthetically streamlined look both modern and ageless.

Materials like natural stone, wood, and metallic accents give such kitchens that feel of luxury. Whichever route you take-either in terms of neutral, muted tones or bolder, statement-making ones-European modular kitchen designs offer limitless opportunities to customize.

**b) Timeless Allure of Luxury Finishes**

A luxury modular kitchen brand is generally concerned with the best material and finishes to achieve an elegant setting. From a polished marble countertops to backsplashes, it’s a space that is more sophisticated in itself when built with cabinetry cut from exotic wood. Introduction of lacquers and matte finishes coupled with metallic twists on gold or copper handles present a layer of opulence in your kitchen, the ultimate declaration for luxury.

Two tone color palette is most common enhancements for the modular kitchen designs. For example, the lower and upper cabinets can be of two different contrasting shades. It may be deep blue with white, charcoal grey with gold, or earthy tones with marble finish. Luxurious kitchens now have much more than a simple balance between aesthetics and functionality.

**2. Luxurious Smart Features Revolutionizing Luxurious Kitchens**

Today, luxury is not only about materials and finishes but rather about incorporating technology into one’s life to enhance convenience and comfort. Smart features in luxury modular kitchens are becoming common, making everyday tasks efficient and easy. Let’s first look at some of the latest technological innovations that are transforming modern kitchens.

a) Smart Appliances for a Connected Kitchen

The hallmark of any high-end modular kitchen is having intelligent appliances. Imagine Wi-Fi-enabled ovens, refrigerators, and even voice-activated faucets. The modern kitchen is ever so interconnected and smart. You can even preheat your oven before you get home through remote control via smartphone apps, or get a message reminding you that you’re running low on supplies.

They have touch screens, suggest recipes, and even internal cameras showing you what is inside without opening the door. Induction cooktops with controls that may be touch-screen could feature precise temperature controls and automatic safety shutoff and energy efficiency.

**b) Voice-Controlled Lighting and Climate Control**

Imagine walking into your kitchen, turning on the lights, adjusting the temperature, or perhaps even switching on the coffee machine, all through your voice. Now it is very much possible with smart home assistants like Alexa and Google Home, which are becoming an integral part of luxury modular kitchens and enable the home owner to create an ideal ambiance that is actually their thoughts without much exertion.

Voice-controlled LED lighting changes color and intensity, dependent upon whether you’re cooking supper or entertaining for dinner. Climate control will make your kitchen comfortable all the time, automatically adjusting the temperature as you desire.

**c) Creative Storage Solutions**

Maximizing space is one of the indispensable keys to kitchen design, so luxury modular kitchens usually showcase high-tech storage solutions, ensuring everything is neatly in place and accessible. It ranges from pullout pantries and corner carousel units to the convenience of soft-close drawers and concealed compartments.

Some kitchens have motorized cabinets that can open with just a touch or a wave on a screen. This makes the frequently used items easily accessible by avoiding the hassle of opening them up with handles or knobs. This makes it quite easy to incorporate all the requirements without affecting the minimalist aspect associated with European modular kitchens.

**3. Customization: Fit Your Kitchen as You Fit it.**

One of the most defining features of a luxury modular kitchen is how it allows for customization to meet the tastes and needs of its owner. Every inch of the kitchen could be designed to the individual’s taste-from layout, material, color palette, to hardware finishes. This means your kitchen will be a reflection of your personality, yet still bring all the functionality necessary to support your lifestyle.

**a) Custom Layouts for Efficient Workflow**

It’s indispensable to a well-planned kitchen design: an indispensible part of the functionality of the cooking space. Luxury modular kitchen brands will offer you seemingly endless options with choosing a layout: from U-shaped, L-shaped designs and open-plan kitchens with large islands, it is your choice which one suits the size of your kitchen, the number of people using it, and your habits of cooking.

For example, if you usually have many guests in your home, an island kitchen provides extra space for seating and to allocate more prep counters for when there are guests. However, if you prefer a smaller, cozier cooking area, a galley or U-shaped kitchen helps you lay an efficient workflow.

**b) Colour Choices which say something about who you are**

A key element in a modular kitchen design is color. Luxurious kitchens often come in sophisticated tones, from charcoal grey and taupe to deep navy. Others prefer bold options like emerald green or royal blue with metallic accents for that glamorous touch.

Using contrastive materials, such as dark wood with white marble or black granite with gold accents, will create a very dramatic and inviting space that feels expensive and intimate. [Modular kitchen color](https://blogs.wurfel.in/) schemes come in such numerous options that you can achieve having the kitchen perfectly customized according to your taste and preferences.

**4. Sustainability in Luxury Kitchen Design**

Sustainability is becoming paramount in kitchen designs, even within the luxury kitchens. This means luxury modular kitchen brands are embracing eco-friendly materials, energy-efficient appliances, and sustainable design practices in their solutions. Thus, homeowners can get to appreciate a luxury kitchen minus compromising on environmental responsibility.

**a) Eco-Friendly Materials and Energy-Efficient Appliances**

Reclaimed wood and bamboo are joining recycled glass in further cabinetry, countertops, and backsplashes of modular kitchens. Similarly, energy-efficient appliances like induction cooktops and smart dishwashers help minimize the carbon footprint of your kitchen, yet performing at top-tier levels.

**b) Water-Saving Technologies**

You could be saving this very precious liquid in your kitchen by incorporating technology in every step, from low-flow faucets and energy-efficient dishwashers to the safest in-carbonation technology. All of these consign both your environment and your utility bills to your history books as luxurious adds-ons to any modular kitchen.

# Conclusion

# The world of luxury modular kitchen design is constantly evolving with innovative materials, smart technology, and tailored customization options as never before in modern kitchens.

This is the seventh eruption of the year and the second one from this volcano. People from nearby towns were evacuated, roads were blocked, and I went out to admire the sunrise and consider reviewing my first-aid course. After all, when you see a mushroom cloud on the horizon, should you dive into the pond or rush off to the basement?

Me and my ex were together for more than 1 year. We were living in the same house with our dog and cats like a whole family. I felt like she was the one and I needed to work harder in order to create a life for us and I started to work 14h+ a day and one day just before going to work I checked her Whatsapp Web and learned that she was cheating on me since the beginning of all this with multiple guys. Worse part is after finding out I couldn't leave her due to attachment issues and the hell began for me. The degrading, insults and many other things I don't even want to write out. Anyway we broke up and we didn't talk after that for 2 months. Just when I started feeling better and thinking about other things in my life, I suddenly wanted to reach out to her so badly yesterday. I tried to fight the urge but I couldn't and reached out to her. She said that she doesn't want to talk to me but didn't resist much to be honest. We met at a coffee shop, had some chats (most of them was her saying how stupid I was for losing her but I actually was fully focused on hooking up with her I actually didn't even care much) We went to her place, after some flirting we had intimacy and slept together. Call it post nut clarity or whatever but now I am scared to literally death and don't want to end up obsessed with her again. She didn't only cheat on me, she 99% was cheating on someone else yesterday as she slept with me, I don't know and I actually don't care. I just felt like I still am not neutral about her and that's horrifying if you know what I am saying. I don't know if this situation throw all 2 months of progress off the window and I could use some help as even now I think about the situation and her which is not a good indicator at all.",2,1732274905.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

# Enhancing Productivity and Employee Morale

In a fast-paced work environment, quick access to quality coffee and tea can make all the difference. Short breaks for a hot drink allow employees to recharge, helping to boost concentration and productivity. The presence of a coffee tea vending machine creates a positive atmosphere where team members feel energised and valued. Studies have shown that these small gestures of care contribute to higher job satisfaction and overall morale.

The convenience of having a vending machine eliminates the need for employees to leave the office for their caffeine fix. This saves time, reduces interruptions to workflow, and ensures that everyone stays focused on their tasks. Additionally, having a well-stocked vending machine enhances collaboration, as employees are more likely to engage with colleagues over a shared coffee or tea break.

# Customisation and Advanced Features

Modern coffee tea vending machines are equipped with state-of-the-art technology, offering customisation options that cater to diverse preferences. Users can adjust sugar levels, milk proportions, or even the strength of their drink, ensuring every cup is tailored to their taste. Some machines even feature multiple drink options, from traditional black coffee and English breakfast tea to exotic blends and decaffeinated choices.

Many machines are designed for energy efficiency, making them an eco-friendly choice for offices aiming to adopt sustainable practices. Additionally, some models support recyclable or biodegradable cups, further reducing the environmental impact.

# Stylish and Space-Saving Designs

A coffee tea vending machine not only serves a functional purpose but also adds a touch of style to the office. With their modern aesthetics, these machines can seamlessly blend into any workspace, whether placed in a break room, reception area, or open-plan kitchen. Compact models are perfect for smaller offices, while larger machines cater to high-traffic environments, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted experience for all users.

# Cost-Effectiveness and Time Savings

Investing in a coffee tea vending machine is a cost-effective solution compared to frequent coffee shop trips. Over time, the savings on beverages purchased externally can be substantial. Additionally, having an in-house solution eliminates the downtime associated with employees leaving the office, streamlining operations and improving overall efficiency.

These machines require minimal maintenance, with easy-to-refill containers for coffee beans, tea bags, or powdered ingredients. Many models come with self-cleaning features, ensuring hygiene standards are consistently met without the need for significant manual intervention.

# Creating a Welcoming Workplace

Having a coffee tea vending machine in the office demonstrates a commitment to employee wellbeing and hospitality. It creates a welcoming space for employees to unwind during breaks and provides an excellent amenity for clients or visitors. Offering a variety of high-quality beverages enhances the overall impression of the office environment, portraying the company as professional and thoughtful.

1gx5mc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/1gx5mc1/i_often_feel_nostalgic_for_that_type_of_rpg/,I often feel nostalgic for that type of RPG gaming enjoyment you could only really experience as a kid,"It’s not just a feeling of nostalgia for specific games. I can still get into the likes of Daggerfal and Morrowind and relive that nostalgia, or completely shatter it if it turns out the game just didn’t age well at all. No, I’m not talking about a longing for specific games so much as that open-eyed approach to gaming as a kid when you could just take everything at face value. And derive so much enjoyment from a game just because you weren’t weighing it (even unconsciously) as a *product* that you’re setting aside time & money to play… and *hopefully* enjoy. 

I miss that lack of second-guessing on my part, but most of all I’d say I miss the time I had on my hands to dedicate to gaming, pure and simple. Pure, undiluted time that you don’t notice passing and don’t care about its passing, the whole carelessness of it that made it so fun. None of this means I can’t enjoy games now… Hell, I’m arguably playing more quantities of games than at any other time in my life, but my approach to games is just so skewered by everything that “adulting” brings (to use that Gen Z word). In other words, I approach games a lot differently and they tend to go through many more filters before I get round to enjoying them the way I want to.

As in, I get burned out a lot faster and I get really selective about what game/genre is right at the moment. For example, I can play something like Last Epoch pretty regularly and just use it as a game in that mechanical sense — I level, buildcraft a bit, kill loads of stuff, loot loads of stuff, and use it to pass those odd hours when I don’t have anything better to do. But if I want to get into a game that’s narrative driven and more focused, like Disco Elysium which I thoroughly enjoyed cigarette in hand & cup of coffee on my table… then I have to really “prepare” myself for the experience, like preparing to read a book you’ve been keeping on a nightstand or something for years but never got to it.

I don’t think I ever made that distinction or like I said, I guess there weren’t no second guessing in my kid brain to think how I’ll experience it. I just got to it and do it, come what may. I had no idea what Planescape Torment was, how weird it would be, or how much I’d like it for the story (maybe the first “narrative” in gaming that gripped me by how bizarre and mature it was to play thru as a kid). 

That’s why his last year or so I’ve been trying to learn from my kid self. That means not reading reviews or getting hyped about stuff – if I can avoid it — and letting things settle before diving blindly into a game and just p-l-a-y-i-n-g. So far it hasn’t let me down, and I think I enjoyed games like Kingdom Come, Baldur’s Gate 3, Witcher 3… yatayata… among many others, MUCH more than I would’ve if I was just pushing thru them aboard the hype train…

I know the title question is maybe too broad to answer.. but do you think your attitude to games is significantly different now compared to when you were younger, and is it in a good or bad way, you feel?",8,1732274600.0,rpg_gamers,2,0.91,False

I told him it would be a minimum of 10 minutes to make and he said that was fine. Then one of the other baristas spilled a drink all over the counter, the bottom of the traveller got soaked, and I couldn’t in my right mind give them a soggy cardboard box full of boiling hot coffee, so I remade the whole traveller, new box and freshly brewed batch and everything. It took me an extra 10 minutes. 

I told myself that “as long as he’s happy he got his traveller,” then it would make up for the torment I put myself through making this traveller, during a 94 transaction half hour, down a person from a call out. 

On top of that, food was already backed up and only got more backed up and we had to split the order into 2 bags. I also had the cups, lids, sugars, and milks in 2 more bags. I gave the customer all 4 bags and the box and he got mad that we didn’t have any bigger bags. And then he started yelling about “I’m gonna be late for work because you said it would only take 10 minutes!” He snapped at me when I apologized and didn’t even say thank you and didn’t even tip.  

So that ruined my day, obviously. I tried to stay positive. I swear. 

Safe to say when a few minutes later someone tried to order a traveler through DRIVE THRU, I told them only if they’re okay with coming inside and waiting at least 30 minutes. Because that’s how much time I wasted on the last traveller. ",5,1732274484.0,starbucks,2,1.0,False

The day before had left him horny and wanting more. The way she ignored him to send him a bill he should cover was all he ever dreamed of.
 

It was a Friday, and he knew what that meant. His Dominatrix would be out and about in the evening. The thought of a night filled with bills made him go hard as he settled in for the day in the office.
 

He made sure to send for her coffee before 7.30am and waited eagerly for his phone to buzz.
 

At 7.35, it did.
""Good pet, now go make more money for me,"" was the reply. 
 

This sent his mind spinning. Sitting in front of his computer fully hard. How had he earned that she wrote him an instruction like that?
 

He tried to work as much as possible but was happy when he could leave work. After some cheap instant ramen for dinner, he got ready for the evening.
 

Kneeling naked on the living room floor, he had connected his phone to the TV. Waiting. A message from her popping up made him feel a wave of extasy.
 

It was for an Uber to a club. He rushed to his payment app and sent her the owed amount. His cock is now fully hard. ""Sent Goddess"" was his reply to her message. He waited. Then he got a thumbs up back. Did he do something wrong, he wondered? Was he too slow to earn a ""good boy"" as a reply?
 

Never the less, he kept waiting. Starring at the messaging app on the TV.
 

*Bing*
Another message. This time it was the entry fee from the club. He made sure to be even faster than last time, and hitting the send button made him twitch. Needing all his willpower not to explode all over the floor.
 
 

His ""Sent Goddess"" was met with a bill for two drinks. He could feel himself on the edge of cumming even before he typed the amount into the payment app and hit send.
 

It would be a hard night. But he knew the special rule for cumming without permission. Needing to cover her rent for the month.
 

While this was still inside his budget, it would mean he had to make a significant cut to his spending that month. So he tried his best to breathe slowly and make himself get away from the edge.
 

It didn't really work, and by the time the next message plopped up on his screen, he knew that he wouldn't make it through the night without cumming.
 

Quickly he covered the bill and sent her a message: ""Sent Goddess, may I please cum?""
 

He waited for her reply. It came in the form of a laughing emoji and a ""no."".
 

He tried his best to keep his mind off the urge to cough. He was able to hold it together for several more rounds of drinks. Each time asking for permission to cum just to be denied.
 

It was 2am now and he was hoping for the night to end with him just having been able to hold it. The phone buzzed, and he saw a bill for a taxi along with a message. ""Taxi home to a guy that gets to fuck me""
 

The moment he read that, he couldn't hold it anymore. Making a mess all over the floor in front of him. It felt so good, yet he felt like the biggest loser.
 

Like a good sub, he went to his payment app to send for the taxi. Then he typed in the amount for her rent. He gulped. His body was shaking as he hit Send.
 

""I am sorry, Goddess."" Was what he sent to her? About then, smiley emojis were what he got in return.
 

""What a loser! Lick up your mesd and go to bed!"" Was the second message.
 

He obeyed, and as he lay in bed, he reflected on the evening. Feeling happier than ever before in his life. He fell asleep thinking about all the things that guy was doing to his goddess.

Super excited to share that [Video Face Swap AI](https://www.videofaceswap.ai/share?source=AppBusiness&ad_id=reddit) is now officially available on iOS and Android—and it’s been an incredible journey so far! 🎉

Here’s how it all started:

We first launched the web version, mostly as a fun experiment. Being a team of TV and movie geeks, we couldn’t resist swapping our faces into everything. Imagine watching The Office with your co-workers’ faces on every character, or starring as Thor in your favorite Marvel movie. Hilarious? Yes. Weird? Absolutely. 😂

But here’s what we realized: no one wants to sit at their computer for this kind of fun. We’re all glued to our phones anyway. And our early users? They felt the same way.

""This is amazing! But when’s the mobile version coming out?""

That’s when it hit us: Face swaps should be portable, effortless, and available anytime. So, after months of late nights, countless tests, and probably way too much coffee, Video Face Swap AI came to mobile. Now, whether you’re at home, on a break, or hanging out with friends, you can create hilarious videos on the spot.

What’s even more exciting? We’ve just hit $3.6K in revenue! 🎉

It’s surreal knowing something that started as a fun side project has turned into a tool that people love and use to unleash their creativity.

Why Video Face Swap AI?

Instant laughs: Swap faces into movies, sitcoms, or viral videos in seconds.

Zero hassle: No fancy setups, no computer needed—just grab your phone and go.

Pure fun: Whether you’re making yourself the lead in Friends or turning your dog into the star of The Avengers, the possibilities are endless.

We’re so proud of how far we’ve come, but this is just the beginning. We’d LOVE to hear your thoughts:

What features would make Video Face Swap AI even better?

First time reddit poster here. I never thought I'd ever post on reddit, let alone in a relationship reddit but here I am.

My over arching question is: ""Did I make the right decision?"" Let me take you on a journey from start to finish on my story.

**How did we meet?**  
I met a girl at work who I had known for three years. We were like ships passing in the night for those entire three years. Either one of us were in relationships, it was bad timing, or (both of us are guilty of this)... we missed the hints the other was dropping.

  
**When did it start?**

I was a contractor at our place of work, and my time was coming to an end. I remember receiving the news that I was finishing up employment. I didn't really care about whether I would find a new job soon. My first thought was that if I wasn't up front with this girl, then my chance would be gone forever. So there I was, stewing over the thought for a month before I decided to ask her out to dinner.

**The first date**

Was magical. We got along so well. We aligned on many important values between life partners such as children, family orientation, value of one another as partners in life and so on. I couldn't fathom it and it honestly sounded too good to be true. We went out for italian food and coffee, even went to an American-import candy shop and bought some of those dried out bugs that are heavily flavoured. I hated them, but I loved experiencing it with her.

Since that day, for 6 months we never spent a day without talking, always saying good night over the phone.

  
**The first 3 months of the relationship**

We both value quality time. We would often spend 4-5 days together during the week and weekend. Lots of dates, laughter, binge watching TV shows. Exceptional communication. We scarcely had arguments, and when we did we always listened to what the other had to say. It was healthy, it was perfect. Even to this day I can not deep down fault this woman and how she is.

  
**The last 3 months of the relationship**

To start it off, I felt as though her demeanour changed. There were more arguments, there was a clear lack of respect on what I wanted to do in the apartment (that I own, and she doesn't live in), or a lack of respect when it came to the arguments. She began to shout, and not listen to what I had to say. The arguments were about the most trivial things, but it started to make me wonder a few things. 

For some context, her relationship with her family isn't the best. There are often arguments between her, her mother and sister. It's a very dog-eat-dog environment. I started seeing this behaviour seep into our relationship.

  
I had tried to converse with her about her behaviour with her family before it got to the relationship, helping her in ways she could better communicate her side of an issue with her family. She has always been very reactive, impatient and quick to anger (all of these traits come from the above context). She would listen, sure, but never put it into practice hence why I started receiving the treatment.

  
There was so many attempts to talk to her about this. All of these attempts were dismissed and nothing was ever resolved. I fell into a state of depression and I became very withdrawn, emotionally unavailable and I would say I neglected her. I didn't check out of the relationship because there was a lot of love there and there still is (hence this post). But despite me being in this state, this woman showed up every single day and sometimes would cook for me, clean the place while I laid around trying to process my thoughts and feelings. I am a extremely deep thinker, and an overthinker, so this lasted for weeks as my mind was going a million miles a second.

  
I then took it upon myself to meet 1 on 1 with her mother to discuss the issues we were having. I knew the issues were the same at home and I was hoping that her mum could provide me with some guidance, or at least some support on how to deal with this because the last thing I wanted was for the relationship to end.

  
The result of the 1 on 1, was an intervention with my partner, her mother, and I. It was not received well as you would expect. She felt attacked, betrayed because we went behind her back. After the intervention, we agreed on a one week no-contact period to decide on what we both wanted.

  
**The decision...**

After a week of no contact, we came together and debriefed on the reflecting we both did during that week. On her side, there was a lot of sorrow, realisation and even changes on her mannerisms (as if the thought of losing me was the wake up call she needed). On my end, there was this fear that she would change her ways for a period of time, and then default back to how she has been (this behaviour has been demonstrated in the past). I was worried that given how I was feeling (the depressed state), I wasn't able to be the partner that (despite all of the bad stuff) she deserved, so I ended things.

  
I have been absolutely tormented by the fact that my heart knows that she is the one. That this woman knows me inside and out, and would support me through thick and thin. My logical mind however feels like I can't trust her to remain changed, or even trust myself to be the man she needs me to be. I have so much guilt for feeling like I gave up on this beautiful girl. Deep down she is not a malicious person, and she loves me without end and I her.

So tell me, did I make the right decision? I am sorry if some of the sections seem short, I didn't want to go on and on so much but I will answer any questions you all might have.",0,1732273755.0,relationship_advice,3,0.5,False

1gx5cft,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1gx5cft/harry_has_shown_mercy_harry_wont_kill_riddle/,"Harry has shown mercy. Harry won’t kill. Riddle, defeated and weak as ever, was brought to face justice. ","The doors to the Wizengamot courtroom creak open, and in strolls Saul Goodman—wizarding lawyer extraordinaire—with a swagger that says he owns the place. His robes are a little flashier than strictly necessary, deep emerald green with gold trim, embroidered with a subtle pattern of scales that might just wink if you look too closely. 
His wand, (12 inches of mahogany, with a dragon heartstring core—whispers of charm and cunning, perfect for the resourceful soul who dances on the edge of legality, bending its will to weave illusions and sway hearts)
Was tucked casually into a holster on his belt, has a gaudy golden handle that catches the light with every step.

Saul adjusts his wide-brimmed hat—dragon-hide, obviously—flashing a grin that’s equal parts charm and mischief. He looks up at the assembled witches and wizards, raises an eyebrow, and claps his hands together.

“Alright, folks, let’s get this show on the road. Who do I have to Imperius around here to get some coffee?”

The courtroom murmurs, some appalled, others barely suppressing laughter. Saul smirks, smooths down his robes, and takes his place at the defense table next to Voldemort, who is glaring at everyone like he’s ready to Avada Kedavra the entire room.

Saul doesn’t even flinch. He leans in, pats Voldemort on the shoulder, and whispers, “Relax, my guy. Let me do the talking. By the end of this, they’ll be begging to make you the next Minister of Magic.”

He straightens up, points his wand at the evidence table, and Summons a neatly bound stack of parchment. “Let’s get one thing straight—this trial? It’s a joke. And lucky for you all, I’m the punchline.”

The courtroom falls silent as Saul grins, his gold-tooth glinting under the floating candles. It’s showtime.

“Alright, let’s get something straight—my client, Tom Riddle, also known as Voldemort, Dark Lord, You-Know-Who, and whatever other dramatic nickname the wizarding world slapped on him—isn’t the monster you’re making him out to be. Did he make mistakes? Sure. Did he aim high? Absolutely. But last I checked, being ambitious and bad at delegating wasn’t a crime worthy of a Dementor’s Kiss.

Let’s talk about this so-called Battle of Hogwarts. You’re acting like my client just woke up one day and said, ‘You know what? I think I’ll destroy a castle today.’ No. He came to negotiate. He offered Harry Potter a chance to surrender—peacefully, I might add. Then what happens? The Order of the Phoenix decides to turn it into Game of Thrones: Hogwarts Edition. My guy tries to avoid a mess, and suddenly, he’s the villain?

Now, the prosecution wants you to believe Voldemort is responsible for everything bad that’s ever happened. Every Cruciatus Curse. Every killing. Every bad cup of tea in Britain. But let’s break this down. Did he personally control every Death Eater? No. Most of them were grown adults who made their own choices. Did he tell the spiders to attack? Nope. Aragog’s kids were freelancing. And the Dementors? Come on, those guys would join anyone offering snacks.

And let’s not ignore the real problem here: Hogwarts’ leadership. These people put children on the front lines. You’ve got a school—a place for learning, mind you—where professors are handing out swords and telling 11-year-olds to take on Death Eaters. That’s not strategy, that’s insanity. Where’s their trial? Or do we just ignore that because it’s easier to blame the guy with no nose?

Speaking of the nose thing—yeah, let’s address it. People love to use that against him, like his appearance makes him guilty. Seriously? What’s next, locking people up for having too many skull decorations? The man has a look, alright? That’s not a crime.

And while we’re at it, let’s talk about Harry Potter. The golden boy of the wizarding world, but let’s be honest: his story is full of holes. He just ‘happens’ to survive every encounter? He ‘happens’ to pull a sword out of a hat? And this whole Elder Wand nonsense? Please. Half of it sounds like it came from one of Rita Skeeter’s romance novels.

The truth is, this trial isn’t about justice. It’s about fear. The Ministry is scared. Scared of Voldemort, scared of the public, and scared of admitting they’ve been asleep at the wand for the last twenty years. They want a quick win, and they want you to give it to them. But think about what you’re doing. If you convict him based on fear and propaganda, you’re setting a precedent worse than Dolores Umbridge with unchecked power.

So, ask yourself this: is this about facts, or is it about tying up loose ends? Because if you can’t prove every charge beyond a reasonable doubt, you’re not upholding justice—you’re playing politics. And if you don’t see that, well, better owl Saul.”

Saul adjusts his tie, throws the Wizengamot a smirk, and sits down confidently, daring anyone to challenge him.",24,1732273465.0,HPfanfiction,5,0.96,False

I decided to research the endocannabinoid system and paradoxical effects of stimulants in some people who may be already a little bit wired and I have to say this has a high 90 percent success rate. 

Sometimes I even have a wee quiet ponder with the Universe and reflect about stuff at the end of the day in the safety of my own home.

Setting a budget can feel like adulting at its most overwhelming, but trust me—getting it right can transform how you handle money. Whether you're saving for a vacation, paying off debt, or just trying to keep your finances on track, a budget is your roadmap.

This guide is here to help you create a budget that actually works for you—without making you feel like you’re depriving yourself of all the good stuff in life. We'll cover everything from tracking expenses to planning for the long term.

# 1. Know Your Income: What’s Coming In?

First things first, how much money do you actually make? This includes your paycheck, side hustles, freelance gigs, or even that generous monthly allowance from your parents (if you’re lucky).

**Pro Tip:** Use your net income (what lands in your account after taxes and deductions) rather than your gross income. It’s the most realistic number to work with.

For example, if your monthly paycheck is $3,000 but you only see $2,400 in your account, use the $2,400. Overestimating income can leave you short later.

# 2. Track Your Expenses: Where Is Your Money Going?

This step is like looking in the mirror—it might be uncomfortable, but it’s necessary. For a month, jot down every expense. Yes, even that $7 latte or the $2 parking meter fee.

Apps like Mint or YNAB (You Need A Budget) make this easy. Or, go old-school with a notebook. The goal is to understand your spending habits.

**Example:** If you’re constantly surprised by how quickly your money disappears, tracking expenses might reveal it’s those small “treat yourself” moments adding up.

# 3. Categorize Your Spending: What’s Really Necessary?

Now that you’ve tracked everything, group your expenses into categories like:

* **Essentials:** Rent, utilities, groceries, transportation
* **Discretionary:** Dining out, streaming services, shopping
* **Savings:** Emergency fund, retirement, investments

This helps you spot patterns. Spending $150 on coffee every month? Maybe that’s fine, or maybe it’s a wake-up call.

# 4. Plan for the Unexpected

Life is full of surprises, and not all of them are good. Think car repairs, medical bills, or a surprise vet visit.

**Cautionary Note:** If you don’t already have an emergency fund, start one. Aim for 3–6 months’ worth of essential expenses. It’s not glamorous, but future you will be grateful.

**Example:** I once had a $500 car repair pop up out of nowhere. Thanks to my emergency fund, it didn’t derail my entire month.

# 5. Set Financial Goals: What Are You Aiming For?

Budgets aren’t just about paying bills—they’re about working toward something. Ask yourself, what are your goals?

* Short-term: A weekend getaway, a new phone
* Mid-term: Paying off credit cards, saving for a car
* Long-term: Buying a house, retiring comfortably

Having clear goals makes budgeting feel purposeful, not restrictive.

# 6. Adjust Your Budget as Needed

Your budget isn’t carved in stone. If your expenses or income change, tweak it! Promotions, unexpected bills, or even inflation can shift your financial landscape.

**Pro Tip:** Check in with your budget monthly to see if it’s still working. Think of it as a living document, not a rigid contract.

# 7. Don’t Forget to Have Fun: You Can Still Enjoy Life!

Budgeting isn’t about saying no to everything fun. Include a “fun money” category for things like movies, concerts, or splurging on your favorite ice cream.

**Example:** I allocate $100 a month for “fun” spending. It’s enough to enjoy myself without feeling guilty—or broke.

# 8. Automate Your Savings

Out of sight, out of mind! Set up automatic transfers to your savings account so you’re building your financial cushion without thinking about it.

**Example:** If you save just $50 a week automatically, that’s $2,600 by the end of the year. It adds up!

# 9. Create a Budget That Works for Your Lifestyle

One-size-fits-all budgets don’t exist. If you’re a foodie, allocate more for dining out. If you love traveling, dedicate a chunk of your budget to vacations.

**Cautionary Note:** Be honest with yourself. A budget that doesn’t reflect your priorities won’t stick.

# 10. Plan for the Long-Term to Secure Your Future

While focusing on the here and now is tempting, don’t forget about future you. Retirement accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) and investments are your ticket to financial independence.

**Analogy:** Think of long-term planning as planting a tree. It takes time, but one day, you’ll have shade (and financial stability).

# Final Thoughts

Creating a budget might seem overwhelming, but it’s honestly one of the best things you can do for your financial health. Start small, keep it realistic, and remember—it’s a tool to help you, not punish you.

If you mess up one month, don’t stress. Adjust, learn, and keep going. Budgeting is a skill, and like any skill, you’ll get better with practice. So grab your notebook or open that budgeting app and take control of your money—you’ve got this!

1gx50zh,https://www.reddit.com/r/dropshipping/comments/1gx50zh/what_8_years_of_dropshipping_on_ebay_taught_me/,What 8 Years of Dropshipping on eBay Taught Me About Avoiding Suspension,"I get this question a lot on how to make sure your eBay account doesn't get suspended when you're dropshipping. I have been doing this for 8 years and rarely ever see this happen to me anymore.

So the main theme we have to understand in all of this is ***eBay's bottom line***. In the end, eBay is a business, and anything that hurts their bottom line is going to be bad for them, and they will try to cut it off.

There are two main subcategories within this theme:

**A) BBE (Bad Buyer Experience)**  
**B) Fraud/Risk Management**

I will discuss both of these topics.

# A) BBE (Bad Buyer Experience)

**Concept:**

If a buyer is not pleased with the transaction, they will be unhappy and may either leave eBay, ask for a refund, or cancel the order. In all of these cases, eBay loses money: they lose a shopper, and they lose the fee they were getting from the sale.

**Ways buyers express their discontent:**

1. **Leaving negative feedback**
2. **Opening up a case (Item Not Received)**
3. **Asking for a return**
4. **You canceling the order**

The worst of these is when they open up a case. Now eBay is losing money because they are not profiting from your selling fees, and it's even worse if eBay has to step in and handle it.

**How to handle each scenario:**

# 1. Leaving negative feedback

If a buyer leaves negative feedback, it means that you have let the transaction turn sour. Usually, it means you're not communicating with the buyer. Buyers will usually message you first before they take action, and even if you can't give them a resolution, if your customer service is great and they feel happy with the attention you gave them, they won't leave bad feedback. So the solution is to make sure you keep them happy.

I like to use ChatGPT and copy the entire chat transcript and tell ChatGPT, ""Make him happy,"" and it will generate a lot of nice words to keep the shopper happy.

If for some reason the buyer leaves negative feedback, I like to refund the customer and see if that will make him happy. But first, I always ask him if this will resolve his issue before I give the refund; otherwise, you may just give a refund, and it will be for nothing. Once he's happy, I ask him to revise the feedback.

# 2. Opening up cases for Item Not Received

If a buyer opens a case, it usually means they didn't get the item. I don't upload tracking to eBay, so the way that I overcome this is every time I get a sale and ship out the item, I message the customer with the expected delivery date, so they can keep a lookout for when it's coming.

The biggest reason they open cases is because they actually didn't get the item. This is usually due to your Amazon account not shipping the item out—maybe you don't have funds on your credit card, or maybe there's a delay on Amazon. When you notice these things, reach out to the buyer and let them know. If they tell you they didn't get the item, I like to just ask them if they want me to reship the item, and they usually say yes. So don't argue with the shopper; just resolve their problem via messages and make them happy.

# 3. Asking for a return

In this case, I like to ask the buyer if they want a partial refund, and if they do, great—case closed. If not, I will just accept the return and send an Amazon return label to them. If the return is still open before the date that eBay is going to step in, I refund them so I don't get eBay involved and continue to process the returns via direct messages. The main point is, you don't want eBay to step in.

# 4. You canceling the order

The main reasons people cancel orders are:

1. **They are not profitable.** If you are not profitable, just ship the item out; it's not worth putting your account at risk.
2. **The item is out of stock.** If the item is out of stock, [click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dropshipping/comments/1d0sa9c/dont_cancel_your_orders_if_youre_out_of_stock_do/) (I wrote a detailed solution for this).

# B) Fraud/Risk Management

# Reason Your Account Gets Suspended: Fraud/Risk Management

1. **Listing high-risk items on a new account.** When you make a brand new eBay account and you start listing TVs, Xboxes, and iPhones, eBay gets scared. So what I like to do is warm up the account properly for a week by listing low-risk items so I don't get flagged by their risk management/fraud bots. So I will list a book, a mug, some coffee snacks, or something that isn't related to fraudsters, and do that for a week. The next week, I would start listing my dropshipped items.
2. \*\*Growing too fast.\*\*Let's say you're getting $5,000 in sales a month, and then next month you get $100,000—that will freak eBay out. Your growth on eBay has to be consistent and not too rapid; otherwise, it will scare them. You have proven yourself to be able to sell $5k/month, so next month you increase sales to $7k and onwards, so you grow while building incremental trust points with eBay.

So these are what I do to avoid getting suspended on eBay.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

**Why Austin Online Driver Education Is the Future of Learning**

The way we learn has undergone a massive shift in recent years, with more people than ever turning to online platforms for education. From college courses to skills training, the internet has revolutionized the learning experience—and driver education is no exception. In Austin, a city known for innovation and adaptability, online driver education has become the preferred choice for teens and adults alike. It’s convenient, flexible, and offers a wealth of benefits that traditional in-person classes simply can’t match. At *Get Drivers Ed*, we’ve seen firsthand how online learning is changing the game, making driver education more accessible and effective than ever before.

In this blog, we’ll explore why Austin online driver education is the future of learning and why more students are opting for online courses to earn their driver’s license.

# 1. Convenience and Flexibility for Busy Schedules

Austin is a vibrant and fast-paced city where people juggle work, school, and other commitments daily. Online driver education offers the flexibility to learn on your schedule, making it a perfect solution for busy Austinites.

# Learn Anytime, Anywhere

https://preview.redd.it/nca8okimkf2e1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98636751a217be2a6635e367cd417b45e27ede96

With online courses like those offered by *Get Drivers Ed*, you can study from the comfort of your home, a coffee shop, or even on-the-go using your smartphone or tablet. There’s no need to commute to a classroom, which saves both time and energy.

# Pace Yourself

https://preview.redd.it/2pp26ftmkf2e1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3c56873613caeef1d8028a3d7d75372051f8558

Traditional driver’s ed classes often follow a rigid schedule, but online learning lets you move at your own pace. Whether you’re a quick learner or prefer to take your time, online courses allow you to tailor the experience to your needs.

For Austinites balancing school, extracurricular activities, or a full-time job, this level of flexibility is a game-changer.

# 2. Cost-Effective Learning

Online driver education is often more affordable than traditional in-person classes, making it an attractive option for students and parents alike.

# No Hidden Costs

https://preview.redd.it/opz4438nkf2e1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51fc9fe369928b1712e9c2fcf48dfffcd415e81a

With online courses, there are no additional costs for commuting, textbooks, or classroom fees. Everything you need is included in the course, keeping costs transparent and manageable.

# Save Time and Money

https://preview.redd.it/a24vu6knkf2e1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21d73510eb3de637d8b4e8cc866e1716b6cf745d

By eliminating the need to travel to a physical location, students save on gas, transportation costs, and valuable time. For a city like Austin, where traffic congestion is a daily struggle, this is a significant benefit.

At *Get Drivers Ed*, our[ affordable online driver education courses](https://getdriversed.com/) are designed to provide high-quality learning at a fraction of the cost of traditional programs.

# 3. Modern Learning Tools for Today’s Students

Gone are the days of sitting in a classroom, flipping through outdated textbooks. Online driver education offers interactive and engaging learning tools that appeal to today’s tech-savvy students.

# Interactive Content

https://preview.redd.it/b03dbiunkf2e1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=537ad5e25aad2cbc0f3b3f51bb26ab649f94006d

Online courses often include engaging videos, animations, quizzes, and real-world driving scenarios to make learning enjoyable and effective. These tools cater to different learning styles, ensuring students stay focused and retain information.

# Instant Feedback

https://preview.redd.it/5mcs6w6okf2e1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8650941b9f45b178eba758b0883d0d9ac9b9cc72

With online driver education, students receive immediate feedback on quizzes and assessments. This helps them identify areas for improvement and reinforces key concepts in real-time.

# Progress Tracking

https://preview.redd.it/tm0c95kokf2e1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b49ce97479420cc962feb1c34fd2ec0329c4c32e

Many online platforms, including *Get Drivers Ed*, offer progress-tracking tools, so students always know how far along they are in the course. This helps them stay motivated and on track to complete the program.

# 4. Adapts to Austin’s Unique Needs

Austin is a city with its own unique driving challenges, from navigating busy downtown streets to handling unpredictable weather conditions like heavy rain or scorching heat. Online driver education programs are tailored to prepare students for these specific scenarios.

# Focused on Texas Driving Laws

https://preview.redd.it/2gwhp4zokf2e1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e8be58ca9c978172fba1fbf196afbe0b133318b

Our online courses at *Get Drivers Ed* are designed to cover Texas-specific traffic laws, including Austin’s unique regulations for areas like bike lanes and pedestrian crossings.

# Practical Tips for Urban Driving

https://preview.redd.it/zotl2ncpkf2e1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f61b1ef9fa66a49d6b4dd1a86336487f34ac31e

Austin’s growing population means more cars on the road and heavier traffic. Online courses prepare students to drive defensively and manage high-traffic areas like I-35 or Mopac Expressway with confidence.

# 5. Self-Paced Learning Builds Confidence

Learning to drive can be overwhelming, especially for first-time drivers. One of the biggest advantages of online driver education is that it allows students to learn at their own pace.

# No Pressure to Keep Up

https://preview.redd.it/rl4fieopkf2e1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55a1cc10b3dcbac37d981979f34c53cb427c798a

In a classroom setting, students may feel rushed to keep up with the rest of the class. Online courses eliminate that pressure, giving students the freedom to revisit challenging topics or spend extra time on areas they find difficult.

# Build a Strong Foundation

https://preview.redd.it/slx3nzzpkf2e1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0153c2040d259f9bdb36c9ab9c4e29a0f055f191

By progressing at their own pace, students develop a deeper understanding of driving concepts, which translates to greater confidence behind the wheel. At *Get Drivers Ed*, our course structure encourages mastery of the material, not just completion.

# 6. Parent Involvement and Peace of Mind

For parents, online driver education offers the perfect balance of independence for their teen and involvement in their learning process.

# Monitor Progress

https://preview.redd.it/ylxz0tbqkf2e1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77d860baafdcb6f481e8d606c59fd1b1ba46f4c0

Online courses allow parents to track their teen’s progress, ensuring they’re staying on track and retaining key information.

# Supplement Hands-On Practice

https://preview.redd.it/momb5hgskf2e1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=069f40e55bdc111643a4e6ceb084e877e9965991

While the online course covers theoretical knowledge, parents can complement it by taking their teens out for hands-on driving practice. Together, these elements create a comprehensive learning experience.

At *Get Drivers Ed*, we encourage parents to actively participate in their teen’s driver education journey, creating a safer learning environment.

# 7. Meets Texas State Requirements

Many people worry about whether online driver education is as effective or legitimate as traditional courses. The good news is that state-approved programs like *Get Drivers Ed* meet all Texas requirements for driver education.

# What Our Course Includes

1gx4t5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/1gx4t5x/alternative/,Alternative ,"I was asked to leave my high school. Halfway through my tenth-grade year, my parents and I were summoned to the principal’s office (not the first time), and I was asked to leave. The alternative was expulsion for truancy which—let’s be honest—was an understatement, I hadn’t seen the inside of a classroom in well over two weeks.

But lucky me, they had an alternative: a program for delinquents. The Elysium High School Alternative Program for Delinquents! (Okay, I made that last part up. But it’s true.) At this point, my parents were in for a few more surprises. I was the first 10th grader ever allowed into The Program AND the first not-pregnant girl ever allowed in. So, basically, I was a prodigy. Very impressive, I know.

Right now, you’re probably thinking you’re about to read a story about one of those kinds of programs. It’s not like that—at least, not for me. EHAP was its own weird world: Lord of the Flies meets Teen Mom, Dazed & Confused meets Boy Meets World. 

Every morning began the same: peer counseling in homeroom. The teachers took this very seriously, and we enjoyed the easy ritual of chatting about our lives while sipping coffee (every classroom had a coffee maker). We observed AA rules in peer counseling, so we weren’t supposed to talk about anything we heard inside those walls. But, well, it was high school, so the only time anyone shared anything juicy was if it was already well-known gossip.

There were only five rooms at EHAP. The front office, manned by a woman who was far too kind and gentle to handle the hellions filing past her desk all day. She was also our school nurse and, occasionally, our babysitter. I can’t remember her name. Adjacent to the office was The Baby Room, which was basically a shoddy nursery (think the room in Stranger Things where young Eleven is attacking the Mind Flayer—minus the rainbow) with a few cribs and toys scattered about. It had cots for the students to take naps on, which was pretty incredible considering we only went to school from 8:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. The moms could retreat to the Baby Room whenever they needed to, or they could enlist a willing babysitter if they had schoolwork to focus on. Every couple at EHAP claimed to have had sex in that room. 

Because we only had three classrooms, we only had three teachers— so, four staff members to manage around 40 teenage dirtbags and their babies. Maybe they let us get stoned at lunch because it kept us quiet.

Traditional education wasn’t the top priority. So, we came up with some very creative ways to earn school credits. Our campus was too small for a gym so we completed our P.E. credits at home. We could earn one credit for every 10 hours of sex or video games, as long as we had someone over the age of 18 sign a paper saying we did it. Yup. I passed two years of science by literally transcribing two seasons of Bill Nye the Science Guy. None of the teachers spoke Spanish, so our only language option was French—which, in Southern California, was pretty hilarious. I stopped taking math in 10th grade, and no one noticed until my senior year. I somehow convinced my favorite teacher, Mrs. Yellin, to just give me the credits so I could graduate as planned.

Mrs. Yellin was the heart of EHAP. The program would not have been the same without her. She motivated us all and wouldn’t let anyone slip through the cracks. She wasn’t perfect, she yelled and she got emotional. But she loved us like her own children, and she wanted us to succeed. Yes, she let me slide in math, but it didn’t interest me and I wasn’t great at it. So she pushed me in writing and extra-curricular activities. She gave me goals to work towards and made me care about high school. I genuinely felt bad when I would disappoint her.  When Mrs. Yellin passed a few years ago it was felt throughout the community. She taught for many years at several schools and I often read the comments students have left for her on social media. That woman was an icon.

Mrs. Yellin was also a smoker! And that meant we  could always talk to her into talking us on a Nature Walk. A Nature Walk had nothing to do with nature or walking. We’d go out to the public park adjacent to our campus and sit on the bleachers and have class while smoking. That’s when I started smoking Cool 120s—because they were so long, we got to stay outside longer. If you were having a particularly rough day, you could ask to go on a private Nature Walk, and the teachers were cool with it, as long as you didn’t take advantage.

There were a few rules: never take advantage, don’t lie to the teachers, treat your peers with respect. (I can still hear Mrs. Yellin’s voice.) Basically, act like adults. Drunk, stoned, underage, uneducated adults. And, oddly enough, it worked 95%of the time.

Lunch was always chaotic. We didn’t have a cafeteria, nobody packed a lunch, and only a few kids had cars, so everyone was always scrambling to hitch a ride. Our classes weren’t divided by grade, and there weren’t many cliques—after all, there were only 40 of us. So, it wasn’t unusual to see a chola sharing lunch with a goth boy in a skirt and a metalhead in a trench coat.

Because the school was so small, the district had no choice but to let us delinquents loose on the town every day for lunch from 10:30 to 11:00. You could get surprisingly sloshed in 30 minutes. The teachers would line up at the gate after lunch to do breath and eye checks. Either Watermelon Hubba Bubba is a miracle worker at covering up the smell of booze or—more likely—our teachers were just glad to have us back in class and weren’t too concerned about the details of sobriety. The teachers hated it when a student didn’t come back from lunch. They would have to go track them down in their personal vehicles to keep the kid out of trouble. We hated that back then, looking back I can see what an incredible kindness that was. 

When I began EHAP, I had zero high school credits. I was failing out. But I graduated a semester early with transcripts good enough to get into UCLA. During my time there I joined student council, I won awards for Junior Achievement, and started attending college three days a week in my senior year of high school. And it wasn’t just me—so many students from The Program, who would have otherwise dropped out or fallen through the cracks, were given this unique opportunity during the brief time EHAP existed. 

Elysium High School Alternative Program was just that: an alternative, and that’s exactly what we need in our education system. I was so privileged to have this experience, and I will be forever grateful for it.
