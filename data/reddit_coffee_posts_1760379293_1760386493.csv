Any recommendations? I found one on instagram called By The Sea Coffee @bytheseacoffeeco on instagram. It looks super cute and seems like positive reviews but I was quoted $2000 for 4 hours of service and that does not include customizing the cups, menu, or signage. Is that expensive? What companies have you used and pricing. Any feedback appreciated! TIA",1,1760386265.0,CapeCod,0,1.0,False

1o5ur0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1o5ur0b/today_my_lo_told_me_that_she_is_falling_in_love/,Today my LO told me that she is falling in love with me.,"This has been a crazy, and beautiful journey. I developed limerence over a friend i had met on the school run, our kids being mutual friends we got used to chatting quite a bit. I saw her as a friend but over time i started to develop feelings. I was in a toxic marriage at the time but i wasn't looking to have an affair or cross any ethical lines, i just knew I was unhappy and that the limerence was a result of that. 

Beginning of this summer the feelings really started to get away with me and i sort of became crushing that i wasn't being authentic with my friend as i couldn't disclose to her, because no matter how unhappy i was i knew that she was married and i assumed happily.  I was getting therapy by this point and felt empowered enough to initiate a divorce and leave my unhappy situation at home.

Back at school after the summer break i was seeing her but trying to avoid her, as it was difficult for me. She continued to be the kind and wholesome person that i'd come to admire and suggested a play date for our kids, now this is the point where it began to escalate and quickly. My wife always had a problem with my LO, not due to anything happening but she was just always really suspicious and jealous of absolutely any woman near me. Because of this said could we leave it a while as things are unsteady at home and my wife is a jealous type, but sure would love to later on. 

This is where things switched, we had always just enjoyed polite conversation and a bit of flirtation but as soon as i mentioned my own situation she opened up about her own marriage and how she is mistreated by her husband and had been unhappy for a long time. 

I asked her for coffee the next day and i was expecting a rebuttal, but she said yes without hesitation with the smile she does that just utterly defuses me and fills me with happiness. At this stage i wasn't sure how it would go, i had thought often about disclosing my feelings to her but i thought that was a no go for a simple coffee date. We met and while we talked about our personal lives in depth for the first time, there was lots of eye contact and laughter and the hour went very quickly. 

I came away from it walking on air, nothing had happened or had been disclosed but i felt like there was actually a connection. 

I messaged her later that day to say i had a really nice time in her company, and she responded. We ended up messaging a lot over that weekend. That was a month ago, we're now seeing each other regularly, for runs, hiking and lunch dates. We're chaste, while we don't feel great about having an affair we're keeping our clothes on, for now, while we navigate our failed marriages and get free.  

Our time together is intoxicating and she admits that she had a bit of a thing for me for a long time. We're definitely into some strong feelings but it's our compatibility that shines, i feel like i've won the lottery of life here. I crushed on a woman who reciprocates but who is also great for me and me for her. Now it's going way beyond crush into something else.

We were sat in the woods today and she told me she was falling in love with me and to be gentle with her heart. I promised her i would. She's incredible. We want to be part of each other's life in the long term. 

Check out my omder posts if you want to read about my struggle with limerence. 

Thankyou kind folks, probably not an ideal story for those struggling as it gives hope but my position is, shoot your shot. ",3,1760386242.0,limerence,1,1.0,False

I'll repost it once I'm done.,"Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) is the most common form of systemic Mast Cell Disease and is known to cause Dysautonomia in some but not all patients. Histamine, serotonin, and dopamine are all neurotransmitters that play a role in regulating sleep-wake cycles and helping the brain transition from sleep to wakefulness. A histamine dump happens when your body produces too much histamine that builds up in the brain. Histamine dumps often happen late at night or early in the morning. You might suddenly feel changes in body temperature, itchiness, or blood pressure changes as your histamine levels rise.

Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) is an immunological condition in which mast cells, a type of white blood cell, inappropriately and excessively release chemical mediators, such as histamine, resulting in a range of chronic symptoms, sometimes including anaphylaxis or near-anaphylaxis attacks. Primary symptoms include cardiovascular, dermatological, gastrointestinal, neurological, and respiratory problems.

[Mast Cell Activation Syndrome](https://www.aaaai.org/conditions-treatments/related-conditions/mcas)

>Patients who suffer from MCAS may experience symptoms in 2 or more organ systems and may mistake physical symptoms for other conditions. In the gastrointestinal tract, symptoms may include diarrhea, constipation, general abdominal discomfort, GERD, bloating/distension and cramping. Neurologic MCAS symptoms may mimic other conditions and appear as OCD-like thoughts and behaviors, mood swings, depression, anxiety, insomnia, and fatigue. Some people who suffer from MCAS experience more typical allergy-like symptoms including wheezing, rashes, hives, skin flushing/itching, and sinusitis. Other skin conditions like cysts, cystic acne, and edema are also common occurrences. Reactions to heat, altitude, alcohol, artificial dyes/additives and certain environmental allergens like pollen and mold all fit under the MCAS umbrella of symptoms. Reproductive system conditions like unusual menstrual cycles and endometriosis; fibromyalgia-like joint pain; and blood pressure/heart-rate dysregulation are all possible symptoms as well. Indeed, MCAS can and does exist alongside other common conditions like IBS, mood disorders, SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth), POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome) and others, making diagnosis complex.

>Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) presents with heterogenous multisystemic inflammatory and allergic manifestations. MCAS is characterized by patterns of aberrant mast cell (MC) overactivity. Mast cell activation disease (MCAD), which includes MCAS and mastocytosis, is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, including various types of dysautonomia, neuropathy (including small fiber neuropathy), myalgia, migraine, headache, cognitive dysfunction, restless legs syndrome, sleep disturbance, non-pulsatile tinnitus, depression, generalized anxiety, and panic attacks. MCAS is the most common variant of MCAD and has an estimated prevalence of 17% in the general population. Despite a significant prevalence, this hyperactive immune disorder is usually not considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with multisystemic symptoms. This is in part due to its relatively recent discovery (2007) and it is generally not included in medical school curriculum .

H1 and H2 Histamine Blocker Protocol for MCAS:

>H1 and H2 histamine receptors are two main classes of histamine receptors that are involved in many different bodily functions:                                             

>●H1 histamine receptors.                                                   
These receptors are found in many tissues, including immune cells, smooth muscle, and endothelium. They play a role in regulating vasodilation, bronchoconstriction, and atrial muscle contractility. H1 receptors are also involved in cellular migration and nociception. Antihistamines that bind to H1 receptors are often used to treat allergies and allergic rhinitis, such as hives, itchy skin, itchy eyes, runny nose, and sneezing.  

>Commonly used H1 antagonists currently available in the United States are cetirizine, levocetirizine, desloratadine, loratadine, and fexofenadine.                                                   

>●H2 histamine receptors.                                                  
These receptors are mainly found in gastric parietal cells but are also present in vascular smooth muscle, neutrophils, suppressor T cells, the CNS, and the heart. H2 receptors are primarily involved in stimulating gastric acid secretion, which is closely linked to the development of peptic ulcers. H2 receptors also modify airway mucus production and vascular permeability. Antihistamines that bind to H2 receptors are often used to treat upper gastrointestinal conditions caused by excessive stomach acid, such as gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) and peptic ulcers. 

>Commonly used H2 antagonists currently available in the United States are cimetidine, famotidine
and nizatidine.

Mast Cell Stabilizers and Other Medications:

>Mast cell stabilizers are medications that can help treat a range of symptoms by limiting calcium flow across the mast cell membrane. This prevents the release of vasoactive substances and degranulation. 
Mast cell stabilizers are often prescribed in combination with histamine blockers. These medications include Cromolyn, Ketotifen, Lodoxamide, 
Nedocromil, Pemirolast, and Epinastine hydrochloride.

>[Other medications used are included here](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/mast-cell-activation-syndrome). They include Montelukast, Singular, and Xolair.

It may be a Histamine Intolerance (HIT) instead or MCAS. Because histamine intolerance involves the mast cells, it is often confused with mast cell activation. The difference, however, is that with MCAS, mast cells secrete multiple mediators in addition to histamine—whereas in histamine intolerance, the mast cells release only histamines and nothing else.

If your Allergist/Immunologist is unable to perform the necessary tests, you may need a referral to a Hematologist who specializes in MCAS.

Many people recommend an elimination diet or a low histamine diet. 

[Food Compatibility List-Histamine/MCAS](https://www.mastzellaktivierung.info/downloads/foodlist/SIGHI-FoodList_EN_Histamin_alphabetisch_inKategorien.pdf)

[Mast Cell Activation Syndrome and Diet](https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthfacts/8114)

Diamine oxidase (DAO) is an enzyme that breaks down histamine in the gut, and DAO supplements may help with symptoms of histamine intolerance. When using DAO, it is important to first lower the histamine levels. Therefore, we recommend following a low-histamine diet for at least two weeks before starting DAO. After these two weeks, you can begin taking DAO three times a day (breakfast, lunch, dinner) while still following a low-histamine diet.

There is no cure for MCAS, but treatments can help manage symptoms. These include avoiding triggers, taking medications that block chemicals released by mast cells, managing stress levels, speaking with a mental health professional, and having self-injectable epinephrine at all times. Some medications that can trigger Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) symptoms include: opioids, antibiotics, NSAIDs, such as aspirin or ibuprofen, alcohol-containing medicines, intravenous vancomycin, neuromuscular junction blocking agents, and local anesthetics.

If your Allergist/Immunologist is unable to perform the necessary tests, you may need a referral to a Hematologist who specializes in MCAS.

How can I get tested for MCAS? 
                                                                        
●Your allergist/Immunologist can diagnose Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) by considering a patient's symptom history, physical exam, and lab tests. A diagnosis is appropriate if symptoms are recurrent, accompanied by increased mast cell-derived chemical mediators, and responsive to treatment. 

●Blood or urine tests.                                                 
These tests can measure mast cell mediators, such as tryptase, histamine, or prostaglandins, which increase during an episode. However, tryptase levels can be elevated in other conditions, so levels alone don't indicate MCAS. A patient should be tested multiple times, both when feeling well and during an episode.                                                                      

●Other factors that may be considered include:              
○An allergy skin test or allergy blood tests to rule out other causes of symptoms.                                          
○A trial of treatment using inhibitors of mast cell mediators, such as antihistamines or other drugs that block chemicals released by mast cells.       

I would research H1 and H2 histamine blockers. There are plenty that are available over the counter. It's recommended to take double the normal dose, one dose of each antihistamine, morning and evening. Many people have recommended cetirizine or Xyzol for H1 and famotidine for H2. 

[Best Antihistamine For Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS)](https://www.drbrucehoffman.com/post/best-antihistamine-for-mast-cell-activation-syndrome)

My symptoms didn't completely line up with MCAS initially. My symptoms have continued to get worse with dry, itchy, watery, and goopy eyes and reactions to certain foods after eating. I started drinking my favorite hazelnut coffee I haven't had in nine months because I switched brands. Now I'm having MCAS symptoms. I'm itchy, sneezing, and have a runny nose after eating or drinking things that don't agree with me. I'm allergic to the fillers in my thyroid medication.

I started the MCAS protocol. I'm took Cetirizine for H1 and Famotidine for H2. I took one dose of each morning and evening. It caused worsening tachycardia and adrenaline or histamine dumps. I was also extremely nauseous. That never happened before. I switched to taking one dose of each Cetirizine and Famotidine in the morning only. My new and worsening symptoms didn't improve. I had to stop. 
I learned that in some people, MCAS symptoms are too severe that OTC medications don't work. And/or we're allergic to the fillers in the OTCs. That's what happened to me.  I take Fluticasone and Hydroxyzine for MCAS. Omeprazole for Gerd (it's a PPI that also acts as a mast cell stabilizer). 

>Please read. This is very important: 

>There are a lot of symptoms associated with MCAS. A lot! ...And many of the symptoms in MCAS can be attributed to other conditions! Some people have primarily gut symptoms, others experience respiratory symptoms; some have more skin issues, and others have significant cognitive issues.  

>Testing for MCAS is not very accurate at this time, primarily due to the short-lived nature of the molecules that we can test for, so we have to rely on a collection of symptoms and the response to treatments to make a diagnosis. 

>Instead of reading through the list of symptoms, however, I recommend starting with the questionnaire below. It is based off the questionnaire found in Dr. Lawrence Afrin’s 2014 article, [A concise, practical guide to diagnostic assessment for mast cell activation disease.](https://www.wjgnet.com/2218-6204/full/v3/i1/1.htm). I just simplified the language in the list, and categorized the questions differently (to make it easier to fill out)!

>The questionnaire at the end of this article is one of the more validated ways to diagnose suspected MCAS. It is based off symptoms, medical history, and test results. It will take 5-10 minutes to complete, and there is no need to share email information – completing it will just give you a score.

>We must remember that MCAS is still a poorly understood condition, and information is constantly evolving. Right now, we don’t have good tests to definitively diagnose MCAS.

>The questionnaire is at the bottom of this link:

>[Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS)-Collaborative Medicine](https://www.collaborativemed.com/mast-cell-activation-syndrome-mcas-diagnosis/)

>This link details MCAS, what it is, what causes it, tests to diagnose it, why testing is often unreliable, and how to treat MCAS with a multifaceted approach. Although it's from a functional medicine doctor, it is the most comprehensive source I've found.

>Our data confirm that histamine receptors blockade may be an effective target to successfully treat long-COVID. Our finding supports the underlying role of MCA in the pathophysiology of long-COVID.

>Some individuals who contract COVID-19 are experiencing symptoms like extreme fatigue, brain fog, chest pain and palpitations, shortness of breath, headaches, sleep disruptions, GI issues, and even rashes that continue on for weeks after the initial COVID-19 infection has cleared up - and in many cases these are even lasting for months, or years. These symptoms tend to also worsen after any sort of physical or mental exertion. The medical community has termed this “Long-COVID” or “COVID Long-Hauler Syndrome.” In fact, a surprising rate of about 30% of COVID-19 patients experiences these long-term symptoms after the initial COVID infection. It also resembles the symptom list of those living with Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS).

>The prevalence of MCAS is similar to that of severe cases within the Covid-19-infected population. Much of Covid-19’s hyperinflammation is concordant with manners of inflammation which MC activation can drive. Drugs with activity against MCs or their mediators have preliminarily been observed to be helpful in Covid-19 patients. None of the authors’ treated MCAS patients with Covid-19 suffered severe infection, let alone mortality.

[Covid-19 hyperinflammation and post-Covid-19 illness may be rooted in mast cell activation syndrome](
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7529115)

>Studies are now suggesting that there is a connection between long haulers and MCAS, finding that the symptoms of long haulers occur because the COVID-19 virus actually triggers mast cells to activate (MCAS) and the subsequent cytokine storms. “Long COVID’ describes post-COVID-19 syndrome when symptoms persist for more than 12 weeks after initial infection with no alternative diagnosis. Both mast cell activation syndrome and long COVID cause multiple symptoms. It is theorized that COVID-19 infection could lead to exaggeration of existing undiagnosed mast cell activation syndrome, or could activate normal mast cells owing to the persistence of viral particles.”

Mayors of small towns were often bizarre representations of humanity. Mayor Nathan Bruenholtz was no exception to this rule. He welcomed Becca and Derrick with a friendly smile, and his handshake was incredibly firm. He seemed warm and inviting, but there was something off about him. When he was informed about the reason for their vision, he acted concerned but in a restrained way. He wanted to demonstrate that he cared, but he wasn’t emotional. This entire performance was obvious to Derrick and Becca, and both wondered why Evelyn never bothered to do any of this. He invited them into his house to discuss further.

How one keeps their home is a representation of their character on the most basic level. Nathan’s character was defined by grass. Pictures lined the wall of grassy fields with a tree in sight. Two book shelves surrounded a fireplace containing blades of grass preserved like leaves. When they sat down, he offered them cups of coffee that he had ready at all times. The mugs had grass painted on them. Both turned them down. They were both unnerved about this obsession, but everyone needed to have a hobby.

“So I’ll help the best I can, but I don’t think that’ll be much. My memory isn’t what it used to be. Just ask my ex-wife.” Nathan’s laugh had a set rhythm and lasted for three seconds exactly.

“What does that have to do with the case?” Derrick asked.

“I am assuming you’ll want my alibi for when he died,” Nathan said.

“That’d be good,” Becca said.

“Well, I was sitting in Mary’s coffeehouse all day. That’s where I am forced to do my work since the Major General kicked me out of my office.” Nathan laughed again for three seconds, but a single tear fell down his cheek. “I heard Richard screaming outside my window, and I went outside to check. By that point in time, Veronica had closed the door to the mansion and told us all what happened. It broke my heart. By the way, is the body still there?”

“Uhh, yes.” Becca narrowed her eyes and tilted her head as she said this. As if thinking about something. 

“Darn, I wouldn’t want it ruining the town hall for good,” Nathan said.

“Don’t worry. It’ll get cleaned up soon,” Becca said.

“That’s good. Anyway, Veronica made a few phone calls and told me we needed to call in an outsider to investigate this. We don’t have a sheriff right now. Our last one retired due to an incident with a deer.” Nathan shook his head. “So much fur. She got on that helicopter the next day.”

“So wait, Veronica was here before the general got killed?” Derrick asked.

“Yep, she came here last week. She wanted to visit her hometown,” Nathan smiled.

“Last question, was she friends with Alyssa Park at all?” Becca asked.

“Those two were practically sisters growing up. Why do you ask?” Becca and Derrick looked at each other. 

“We found out that Alyssa had been stabbed,” Derrick said. Nathan gasped.

“My word, what is our happy home coming to?” Nathan asked. 

“Indeed, sorry to be the one to break the news to you,” Becca said.

“No, I’d find out eventually.” Nathan shook his head. “Bring whoever did this to justice.”

“We’ll try,” Derrick said. When they left his house, they looked at each other.

“Veronica lied a lot more than we thought. Why didn’t she say that she found the body?” Derrick asked.

“Also, why is the body still at the crime scene? I know its recent, but don’t they have a morgue?” Becca asked.

“That one struck me as less suspicious. Remember when Evelyn used our morgue to store her sewing equipment,” Derrick said.

“Point taken, but that still leaves a lot up for question. Like why would Veronica invite us here in the first place?” Becca said.

“I don’t know either way we should get back to Veronica. She’s probably tampering with evidence as we speak,” Derrick said.

As they walked, Mark passed them. Becca smiled and waved while Mark sneered.

“It’s a horrible day out here today,” he said.

“I think it's kind of pleasant,” Becca replied.

“Of course, you would. You are the reason today is awful. You and your partner are running around our quiet little town asking questions.” Mark flashed a gun. Derrick and Becca held up their hands. “Don’t do that. Put them down.” They obeyed. “Now, we are going back to Veronica to take care of you two.” He shook his head. “This was way more complicated than it needed to be, and I hate complicated things.”

“So do I,” Derrick said.

“Shut up.”

My partner is a great guy. I will say nothing but positive things about him and I care about him
a lot.  Unfortunately, I just know that this isn't the right thing for me. I plan to break up with him in the next month or so.  

We have been dating 3 years, I'm childfree and we do not live together.  He has two elementary aged children who I am close with and have been heavily involved with.  One child has been diagnosed ADHD and is a handful- parents don't want to medicate him, but also won't/haven't explored therapy.  I'm struggling there a lot. 

We are both in our late 30s. He has every weekend custody-  we haven't had the kids maybe 4 times in 3 years. Both own our own businesses so weekdays are busy, we see each other two nights a week. The weekend custody is not great.  

Ultimately, I want a partner who has more flexibility to travel and can be a partner to me 100% of the time. I want to be able to go away for a weekend without feeling guilty for asking him to take time away from his kids.  I want to be able to wake up late on a saturday morning and walk to get coffee. I don't want soccer saturdays and early wakeups where fighting amongst the kids starts immediately. I have a lot of friends and hobbies that fulfill my life, so I don't need a partner to be my everything, but I would like someone who I can build a life with and grow together.  

I know I do not want to live with him and the kids.  We discussed living together before, but nothing ever worked out.  As time went on, I became clearer about the lifestyle that I really want, and this just isn't it. I've started to express doubts about the relationship, sharing how I haven't felt prioritized.  He has been making an effort, but ultimately I know that even with all the effort in the world, it won't change the lifestyle he has and the one I want. 

I feel sick over it but I ultimately know it's the right decision.  Any advice on how to approach this with him? Validation that I'm not an evil monster?

Written like this, it sounds more like a defeat than a victory, but I’d say the intensity of the symptoms had been gradually increasing the whole time. Now, for the past few days, I’ve actually been feeling really good: motivated, ready to talk, and ready for action.

This is the update to this post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/s/IFMKQ6wQbc 

So, stress was the reason. And the fact that at the different location I am at home.
The gut–brain axis comes into play. Stress makes me more sensitive to histamine. IBS is also part of the picture. A low-FODMAP and low-histamine diet helps, but it’s unsustainable and exhausting for the body. 
I have a love–hate relationship with coffee, but it seems I can’t tolerate it well during more stressful periods.

The change I made: grain-based coffee in the morning with plant milk (low sugar is a must, but not necessarily low carb) and a micro breakfast (a cracker, 2–3 teaspoons of oats, etc.) along with probiotics suitable for histamine intolerance. 
After that kind of breakfast, I stay mentally clear even though I still feel a flare-up in my body. My head stays clear and that’s the most important part. 
I also drink a large glass of water with creatine (1–2 g a day is enough for my weight). Creatine also helped with the depression linked to brain fog.

For the rest of the day, I prefer small meals. I feel a slight flare-up after almost everything I eat, but it doesn’t lead to brain fog.

It’s been several days now, and I feel like a new person.
If I want to eat something that could trigger me, I take DAO beforehand.

All of this is mentioned somewhere on this sub, but I hope that sharing my experience in a more concise way will help someone.

TL;DR: I addressed histamine intolerance, added probiotics and creatine and switched to mini meals  especially a mini breakfast.

1o5um92,https://www.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/1o5um92/mastering_ai_for_linkedin_6_months_of_experiments/,Mastering AI for LinkedIn: 6 Months of Experiments & What Really Works,"# I've been testing AI for LinkedIn posts for 6 months. Here's what actually works (and what doesn't)

Similar to many of you, I started using ChatGPT and Claude to help draft LinkedIn content. At first, the results were... mediocre at best. Generic. Robotic. The kind of posts that scream ""I used AI for this.""

But after months of experimenting with different prompting strategies, I've figured out why most people get terrible AI-generated LinkedIn content: **they're asking the wrong questions in the wrong way.**

**The problem with ""write me a LinkedIn post about X""**

This is where most people start, and it's why the output feels soulless. AI needs context, structure, and examples—just like a junior writer would. The more specific you are, the better the results.

**What actually works:**

**1. Give the AI your objective upfront**

Don't just say ""write a post."" Tell it WHY. Are you trying to spark conversation? Demonstrate expertise? Share a lesson learned? The AI needs to know what success looks like.

Example: ""Write a LinkedIn post that positions me as knowledgeable in data analytics, targeted at mid-level managers. Include two actionable insights and end with a question.""

**2. Feed it examples of your style**

This was my biggest breakthrough. I started copying 3-4 of my best-performing posts into the prompt and saying ""match this tone and structure."" The difference was night and day.

**3. Be explicit about structure**

LinkedIn has its own rhythm. Short paragraphs. Punchy hooks. Clear CTAs. I now always specify:
- Start with a hook (question, surprising stat, or bold statement)
- Use short paragraphs or bullet points
- End with a question or call to comment
- Keep it under 200 words

**4. Define the tone precisely**

""Professional but conversational"" means different things to different people. I get better results when I say things like ""write like you're explaining this to a colleague over coffee"" or ""keep it direct and solution-focused, no fluff.""

**5. Iterate and refine**

The first draft from AI is rarely perfect. I'll often follow up with ""make the hook stronger"" or ""add a personal anecdote to the opening"" or ""remove the jargon and make it more accessible.""

**What doesn't work:**

- Vague prompts without context
- Expecting it to know your brand voice without examples
- Not specifying LinkedIn's format (it'll write like a blog post otherwise)
- Asking for multiple topics in one post (keeps it unfocused)

**My current go-to prompt structure:**

""Draft a LinkedIn post about [topic] for [audience]. Start with [type of hook]. Include [number] of [tips/insights/lessons]. Use a [tone description] tone. Format with short paragraphs. End with a question about [related topic]. Here are examples of my writing style: [paste 2-3 samples]""

**The honest truth:**

AI won't replace your voice or your ideas, but it's incredibly useful for:
- Overcoming blank page syndrome
- Restructuring your rough thoughts into readable format
- Testing different angles on the same topic
- Speeding up the drafting process

The posts that perform best for me are still the ones where I start with my own authentic idea or experience, then use AI to help shape and refine it.

**Curious to hear from others:** What's been your experience using AI for LinkedIn content? What prompting strategies have worked (or failed spectacularly) for you?",1,1760385958.0,linkedin,0,1.0,False

In daily life I meet quite some women who wear a hijab. I have jons where I meet them and take language classes with people from all over the place. I talk to people, have a cup of coffee here and there. But these women do not know I am ftm. And now I find myself in a strange situation in which I am seen as one of the women (I am mid transition and pass sometimes but not always) and they take their hijab off around me. Now I do not mind as to me it holds no significant meaning to me - as long as people are comfortable, I am comfortable. 

The question I have: should I tell them? Would it be ""wrong"" for either of us to be in this situation? I know a lot of it depends on specific cultural background and so on. And my question is not about me feeling uncomfortable about being misgendered (I have a chest and don't pass and have no energy to correct people as long as I'm in the process), but about a weird (misplaced?) Sense of responsibility I feel. 

Please, guys with more insight than me: what is the best way to handle this? Just leave it be or just tell them right away (in the future)? Anyone with experience?

She enjoys listening to me talk about the game and lore or rant about sets, card balance, and power creep but she has explicitly not been interested in playing the game.

Yesterday, however, she surprised me while we were in line to get coffee. She was scrolling through her phone and unprompted said that since there's Dr Who cards, she would want to learn how to play if Piper Halliwell from the original Charmed was in the game. No, obviously, if I wait for long enough there will be a Charmed UB, but hopefully by then I will have moved on to more affordable hobbies like drugs or yachting.

I would like to make a proxy card for her that captures the powers of that character, if not her whole essence. I know full well that she still probably won't actually play the game and I'm willing to accept that if she sees the card, rolls her eyes, smiles, and calls me ridiculous. I have a little experience proxying, so I come to you asking for card suggestions, art suggestions, or maybe directions to someplace where I might find custom cards people have made for this series, even if they're not great.

All suggestions and help is welcome, but I'm really trying to shoot for a vibe and will put in the legwork to make it happen if a suggestion is close but not what I'm looking for. Ultimately, the perfect card would have/be:

- an actual commander that exists
- One to three colors
- A tap, stun counter, phase, or exile ability, to represent Pipers freeze magic
- a damage or kill ability to represent her explosive magic
- art of the Charmed characters in an mtg style",1,1760385755.0,mtg,5,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I just brewed a fresh cup of coffee using our break room’s fancy Swiss machine (it grinds the beans and everything) when one whiff sent a spear straight to my heart. 
I was instantly transported back to a time, not even four years ago, where I’d come home from college to visit my Dad. 
I’d come in, lugging all my dirty laundry with me, plop it on the floor and hear my Dad in the kitchen singing and cooking. He’d yell to greet me, I’d walk in, give him a big hug and head straight to our Keurig. He had a “fancy” Keurig (as fancy as a k-cup coffee machine could be) with a drawer beneath it that housed the combo pack of k-cups from Costco (say that 5x fast.) 
Opting for a French Roast most of the time, I’d pick a mug from the collection we’d amassed over the years and sit down with my precious elixir, my dad already having gotten out the creamer and sliding it over to me where I sat at our island. 
We’d talk and talk for hours. And then talk some more. About politics, life updates, relationship issues, funny things we’d seen, family drama, worries, new music we’d found - nothing was off the table. At some point my dad would brew his second or third cup of coffee of the day or we would switch to wine. Nevertheless, I could always count on a fresh cup of coffee and conversation with my Dad when I came home to visit. 

It has been 2.5 years since he died and every cup of coffee since then has hurt my heart. I smile thinking about the memory of our coffee talks, but my chest aches knowing I will never be able to have a cup with my Dad again.

* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

1o5uepp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o5uepp,"tried a few hyped fragrances and was disappointed, now i’m feeling lost ( T _ T )","helloo !! idk how to properly format posts so this is gonna be a bit rambly :P (warning this got super long)

**TLDR**: i have no clue what notes to look for in a fragrance. i want to smell sweet and yummy, playful and young, but i still want some spice because pure sweetness just hurts my nose !

so to start, i’m a sweet girly. i wanna smell like a bakery in the most girly girlypop girl way ! i am also a cheapskate ! so whenever i see a new cheap fragrance being hyped to the moon and back as “THE only chocolate/vanilla/gourmand you will ever need”, I JUMP !!!  
(for summer i prefer sweet and fruity scents like most people probably. i haven’t gotten many of those yet but i really like ariana grande’s thank u, next ! very cute scent :3)

anyways, 

**so far i’ve tried:**

- choco musk, oil and perfume
- tubbees chocolate fudge & sweet caramel 
- paris corner khair 
- pink sugar
- sabrina carpenter’s sweet tooth

and i haven’t really loved any of them… now, maybe my nose just sucks. i’m a very simple gal, i don’t really know how to even sophisticatedly describe what i’m smelling, and i honestly also don’t really know what most fragrance notes mean which is why i’m pretty scared of some of the more complex high (or rather mid-end, i guess, like 50 bucks per 75ml) end perfumes with lots of different spices etc in their notes.   

**quick description of my likes/dislikes for these fragrances: **

for the choco musk perfume, i don’t really smell chocolate at all. tbf i _did_ see differing opinions before ordering it, so i knew it might not be what i’d hoped for. i’ve had it for like a year now and i don’t feel like the scent has changed much. to me it smells like caramelized almonds ? with some marshmallow ? but it has this weird heavy scent… kind of artificial i guess, which gets too much for my nose quickly. 
the oil is a tad better, way creamier i think but it doesn’t really project at all afaik. at least on me i feel like. i do like layering that with other perfumes though ! 

for the tubbees, i know these are children’s fragrances so don’t take what i’m about to say too seriously, but i absolutely HATED chocolate fudge. it smells so, SO incredibly synthetic to me it actually hurts my nose. it’s the most disgusting chocolate i’ve ever smelled. the dry down seemed to be a bit better but honestly i’m afraid of wearing it anywhere because it just was so horrendous on the first spray LOL. like i don’t know if i wanna put myself through the 30 mins of horrible torture only to smell mid for the rest of the day. 
here i prefer the salted caramel scent, it’s soooo warm and nice and sweet and UGH i wanna eat myself !!! although i wish there was some more.. depth to it i guess ? idk maybe like coffee notes or something ? 

now paris corner’s khair…. i don’t know what to think. i do enjoy it but i also feel like it smells a little cheap, kind of soapy i guess ? i’m afraid that when i wear it people will judge me for not wearing $1,000,000 perfume. idk !! again, i wish this was deeper/spicier in a way. i just can’t explain how. other than the soapy smell though i do like it !! 

pink sugar.. i don’t even know ! dude, it smells anything BUT sweet to me. so odd…. it’s just sickening. i can’t even describe it, again, i smell no fruitiness (going by fragrantica notes), no sweetness, nothing pleasant. it just smells like different expired (if they even can) laundry detergents mixed with vinegar ??? 

sweet tooth is the only one of these that i actually, really like. i don’t LOVE it because on me, this also has very little projection and/or sillage, but i like how soft, warm and cute this smells. if it was stronger i would be so delighted. i’d buy 100 bottles. 

**my confused conclusion:** 

to be completely honest, i don’t even fully know what qualifies as a gourmand and what doesn’t, so don’t kill me please. i just wanna smell like nice food. but these experiments with different scents have just made me think that maybe, just maybe, i’m not a full gourmand girly ? like, i don’t know what all the other food-ish perfumes with more complexity qualify as, but maybe that’s my route. or maybe i just haven’t found the right fragrance yet ? I DONT KNOW !! 

like i said, i don’t want to smell like a sophisticated seductive girlboss yet. i just wanna be a sweet cutie, but i also don’t want to smell like i’m made of 500 different chemicals that are trying their hardest to resemble some candy. i want to smell like i’m fresh out the oven !! and all the reviews i’m constantly seeing of budget fragrances always get me. and then i just get disappointed time and time again. lol 

should i just save for a better quality perfume ? and if so, which ones would you recommend me ? ESPECIALLY GOOD CHOCOLATES ?? 😭 (maybe chocolate just isn’t for me though, going by my experience with the tubbees fragrance. i feel like any other chocolate scent would still be too overpowering for me, unless it’s dark chocolate maybe ?)

some stuff ive been eyeing is lattafa eclaire, black opium (but i feel like that might be too mature for me just going by descriptions), paris corner marshmallow blush, sweet tooth caramel dream (but i know it won’t be stronger than sweet tooth ;w;), paris corner date caramel, and similar. 

i’m a blind buy gremlin, so…. i can’t really do anything other than watch 10 million reviews :’D (also i don’t know if these brands sell samples-)

ALSO to add, i’ve bought and tried a super super cheap dupe of good girl (so probably nowhere close to the original, but alas) and i do kinda enjoy that too. idek anymore ! ",1,1760385517.0,FemFragLab,1,1.0,False

Here is my situation.

# First week or two of having coffee (after having had none for a week or two):



1x single shot of coffee helps me feel more motivated and alive and faster. Can sleep fine.



# Continuing coffee after this time:

The caffeine seems to build up in me.



Continuing even just 1x single shot of coffee at 6am (no other caffeine drinks throughout day), makes me **completely** unable to sleep at night, unless I take a sleeping pill.



Also even this small amount causes me to hear voices, feel exhausted and extremely anxious. It makes me want to sleep at 6pm. Even by say 3am I will have had zero sleep though.



# Summary:

Coffee (single or double shot) helps me for the first week or so, then I start to partially lose my mind and have NO ability to sleep without a sleep tablet.



I've tried Green Tea but it doesn't engage my mind as well as coffee.



# Questions:

Am I better to try:



\- Drinking just a 1/2 or 1/4 shot every day?

\- Drinking single or double shot just 3 days a week?

\- Some other drink?



And simply - what's going on here?

A young Caucasian woman, 22 years old, with light freckled skin and visible pores, stands relaxed at a busy city crosswalk in an unedited iPhone photo aesthetic, everything in sharp focus from foreground to background; she wears a black and blue Supreme jacket and carries a white shoulder bag, her hair pulled into a neat bun, slightly tilted and off-center in the frame, with casual framing that captures the surrounding street scene, including a Starbucks Coffee sign, yellow taxi cab, pedestrians, and scaffolding-clad buildings, early evening light casting warm tones on brick facades, and the overall mood crisp and candid as if captured mid-mostasis, with natural textures and pores visible on the skin, subtle shadows, and a sense of urban motion.
2. A young Caucasian woman, 22 years old, with light freckled skin, visible pores and natural skin texture, sits casually on a sunlit city curb holding a half-full glass of pale beverage; the unedited iPhone photo aesthetic is preserved with everything in focus and a slightly tilted, off-center framing. She wears dark sunglasses, a white lace-trim tank top, blue jeans, and delicate jewelry; lighting is slightly uneven with low exposure, a touch of blur and grain, and a sharp background; the scene captures casual, candid street portrait vibes with natural, relaxed expression.
3. A young Caucasian woman, 22 years old, with light freckled skin and visible pores, stands in a formal green setting wearing a muted, textured olive-green coat with a large collar and subtle pattern, holding a matching green handbag with rounded silhouette and Gucci monogram texture. She wears a patterned green headscarf with gold accents, pinned by a single pearl earring, and remains barefoot or with neutral footwear just out of frame. The unedited iPhone photo aesthetic is preserved: everything in sharp focus, slight tilt and off-center framing, relaxed standing pose, natural skin texture visible.

**results**

set 1 - both models were solid. nanobanana matched the jacket reference more accurately. Seedream looked more real overall because it actually respected “no blur” and kept the background crisp.

set 2 -nanobanana nailed subject detail and felt real up close, but it slapped on that background blur again, which makes it scream AI. Seedream kept the background cleaner, though it can lean a bit saturated.

set 3 - seedream followed the brief better (layout/wardrobe/pose felt on-brand). nanobanana drifted from the prompt, but i still preferred NB’s final image aesthetically.

**my thoughts**

Seedream: better prompt adherence, especially on “no blur clear background.” Can look over-saturated/AI-ish sometimes.

NanoBanana: weaker prompt adherence for background handling but good at reference matching (like the jacket) and from your broader use, strong for edits and consistent characters.

\[Verse\]

 Feeling like a one-eyed tractor pilot

Plowing up fields of empty dreams

 That farm girl broke me Left me dry

 Took the milk Left no cream

 And I’m stuck here My heart a busted wheel

 \[Chorus\] 

She left me with dirt

 She left me with dust

 Didn’t even sweep

 Didn’t even trust

 All I’ve got now’s this aching blade

 And the only thing on my mind is getting laid

 \[Verse 2\] 

I drink my coffee black as the night

 Swear at the stars

 They’re too polite

 Her lipstick’s still on my rearview mirror

 But her promises are nowhere near

I’ll mend this heart with rusty steel

 \[Bridge\] 

The barn doors slam

 The rooster crows

 She took my boots

 She took my soul

 I’m a one-eyed fool with no control

 Just a tractor pilot on a lonely roll

 \[Chorus\]

 She left me with dirt 

She left me with dust

 Didn’t even sweep

 Didn’t even trust

 All I’ve got now’s this aching blade

 And the only thing on my mind is getting laid

 \[Outro\] 

The plow keeps turning

 The night stays cold

 Her shadow lingers

 My story’s old

 But tomorrow’s fields might just get made

 And the only thing on my mind... well

- I’m a 23 year old woman looking for a long term (monogamous) relationship, I wouldn’t mind starting with long distance if we truly connect but I do expect that in a future we will make plans about meeting in real life and eventually move our lives to close that distance :)
- Right now I’m on my last year of college, and I’m planning on doing a long trip afterwards as a graduation gift, so I wouldn’t mind finding my traveling partner, just a side note tho, if you agree, then you are also agreeing to taking a million pictures of me and the two of us together haha
- I’m very into horror books at this moment, my latest read was “Tender the flesh”, and all I can I say that is a fantastic book that everyone should read! But usually I tend to like more dramatic or romance books
- I’m a very active person and love outdoors, so I’m hoping yo find someone who is like me in that aspect 
- I’m a huge morning person, so if you are looking for someone to get you coffee before you wake up in the morning, I’m your gal 
- I’m a sucker for the sopranos, parks and rec and Gilmore girls, I think I have seen those shows a millions times.
- I’m a big yapper haha, I can talk about everything and nothing for hours, so hopefully my future partner is either a great listener or also a yapper
- A big no’s from me are definitely smoking and drugs, but I do occasionally like to drink

What I’m looking for is a nice, funny, and sweet guy, someone who is in their mid-late twenties, please be polite and not rude if you decided to message me! And if you did read this far, send me a text about the greatest concert you have been to! Pictures about yourself are so welcome, would love to put a face to the person I’m talking to :) ",8,1760385369.0,cf4cf,1,0.83,False

I’m 25, female, and really hoping to develop some genuine friendships with other women! I’m super quiet like… 90% of the time, but once I warm up, I love talking shit and laughing about the most random things.

I’m currently in school for my RN, so I get busy and disappear sometimes, but I promise I come back. I love horror, dark humor, and I’ve got 10 tattoos of completely random stuff (none of them make sense, and that’s kind of the point).

I’m southern, into sarcasm, iced coffee, late night venting, and people who can hold real conversations without being weird. I’m not looking for anything romantic, just chill, funny, supportive friends who get the chaos of adulting, school, and trying to keep your sanity intact.

If you’re also a woman who’s tired of surface-level convos, hit me up. 🖤

As you can probably tell by my profile, I stand out a little. Think this prevents me being approachable in real life. People often judge me by my cover and make assumptions.

I am 6’4, slightly muscular and also wear an eye patch. So stick out like a sore thumb, a little. 

Don’t know what I’m looking for to tbh, see what happens. 

Bit of an old fashioned guy, rough and ready.. a man man. 

Enjoy food, good intelligent conversation, healthy debates and a good box set or two. 

I’m not gym obsessed, not one of these that is religious about healthy eating and protein. I eat takeaway 3 times a week, drink copious amounts of coffee and a lot of snack food. I just work hard to keep myself in decent shape.

Curtis LeMay During a Seance, and He Told Me the Air Force Will Get Paid","So last night, me and my dorm bros in the Air Force decided to hold a seance because DFAS was late (again) and our LES still said “PENDING.” We figured if anyone had the power to fix it from beyond the grave, it was the ghost of Gen. Curtis freakin’ LeMay.

We lit a single PT candle, placed a coffee-stained copy of AFI 36-2903 in the center, and formed a circle around a plate of cold DFAC chicken. I whispered, “Spirit of Strategic Air Command, we call upon thee…”

The room got cold. Like, “Bagram flightline in January” cold. The candle flickered, and suddenly—*BAM*—the smell of cigar smoke and jet fuel filled the air.

Out of the shadows stepped **Gen. Curtis E. LeMay**, wearing perfectly pressed blues from 1962, cigar in hand, eyes like he was about to drop nukes on our morale. His ribbons looked heavier than my student loans.

He looked around our dorm room—Crocs, energy drinks, Xbox controllers, and a sad motivational poster that said *“Aim High”*. He took one puff of his ghost cigar and growled:

>

I was like, “Sir, we’re just waiting on pay.”

He snapped his ghost fingers and said,

>

Then he pointed his cigar at my Nike slides.

>

Another airman tried to offer him a Monster. LeMay looked at it like it was an act of treason.

>

I swear, the lights flickered when he said that. Even the WiFi cut out.

Finally, I asked, “General, will the Air Force get paid?”

He leaned in, smoke swirling around him, and whispered:

>

Then he disappeared—just *poof*—leaving behind a faint smell of cigar ash and old-school leadership.

This morning, our LES updated. Pay’s processing.

So yeah. The ghost of Curtis LeMay showed up, roasted my whole dorm, and apparently strong-armed DFAS from the afterlife.

**TL;DR:** Held a seance to summon a WWII legend. Got roasted for being soft. LES updated 6 hours later. Coincidence? Doubt it.

I’m not here for fleeting chats or curated selfies. I’m hoping to find someone who wants to build something a little more real. Something slow, imperfect, and honest.

Recently turned 26, where did all the years go?

Overthinker, coffee addict, occasionally funny when sleep-deprived

Lover of deep conversations, cozy silences, and finding beauty in mundane things

Currently battling my own mind, deadlines, and existential dread but still hopeful, still curious about people


About you?

You don’t need to have it all figured out (actually, it’s better if you don’t)

You miss late-night talks that feel like therapy

You believe in sincerity over aesthetics

You’d rather swap weird confessions, music, book ideas, or even favorite comfort foods than “wyd” texts

Maybe we’ll bond over burnt cookies, unfinished books, or the absurdity of adulthood. Maybe we’ll create our own space to talk about everything and nothing. Maybe we’ll send each other songs that feel like home.

If you’re also tired of pretending and just want to connect as two humans trying to navigate this mess called life, drop me a message.

Let’s skip the small talk and get to the good stuff.

I’m writing this at a weird hour, because loneliness doesn’t respect office hours, and sometimes you just need to admit to a stranger that you’re not okay.

I’ve been feeling pretty lost lately behind in life, behind in academics, and ahead only in self-doubt. I keep thinking I should have it all figured out by now… but I don’t. And maybe you don’t either. Maybe that’s okay.

I’m not here for fleeting chats or curated selfies. I’m hoping to find someone who wants to build something a little more real. Something slow, imperfect, and honest.

About me:

Recently turned 26, where did all the years go?

Overthinker, coffee addict, occasionally funny when sleep-deprived

Lover of deep conversations, cozy silences, and finding beauty in mundane things

Currently battling my own mind, deadlines, and existential dread but still hopeful, still curious about people


About you?

You don’t need to have it all figured out (actually, it’s better if you don’t)

You miss late-night talks that feel like therapy

You believe in sincerity over aesthetics

You’d rather swap weird confessions, music, book ideas, or even favorite comfort foods than “wyd” texts

Maybe we’ll bond over burnt cookies, unfinished books, or the absurdity of adulthood. Maybe we’ll create our own space to talk about everything and nothing. Maybe we’ll send each other songs that feel like home.

If you’re also tired of pretending and just want to connect as two humans trying to navigate this mess called life, drop me a message.

Let’s skip the small talk and get to the good stuff.

I welcome sincerity and depth but only from those who stand with Palestine. That’s a non-negotiable stance for me.",0,1760384991.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

It wasn’t messy. No cheating, no screaming. We just... ended.

That’s what makes it worse, I think. There’s no one to be mad at. Just this huge empty space where someone used to be.

I still wake up and check my phone expecting his “good morning” text. I still pause music halfway through a song because it reminds me of the drive to his house. His toothbrush is still in my bathroom drawer I can’t bring myself to throw it away, but seeing it there every day feels like pressing on a bruise.

Everyone keeps saying, “You’re young, you’ll move on,” like that makes it easier. But he wasn’t just my boyfriend. He was my person during some of the most confusing years of my life. He knew all my little habits the way I hum when I’m anxious, the way I make my coffee too sweet, the way I go quiet when I’m sad.

Now I catch myself wanting to tell him something funny I saw, and I have to stop mid-sentence because there’s no one to send it to anymore.

I know I’ll be okay eventually. I’m keeping busy, I’m talking to friends, I’m trying. But there’s this quiet that follows me around now, like the world got slightly dimmer without him in it.

1o5u0l0,https://momdadtracker.app,The Pain All Parents Know Too Well,"There’s a special kind of love that only parents understand — the one that comes wrapped in exhaustion, interrupted thoughts, and tiny voices saying “Mom, look!” or “Dad, look!” a hundred times a day.

It’s beautiful.
It’s chaotic.
And sometimes, it’s just… too much.

No matter how patient we try to be, there’s a moment when your coffee goes cold, your brain fogs, and all you want is five quiet minutes. But you can’t switch it off. Because behind every “look!” is a child craving connection, a small soul asking to be seen.

That’s the paradox of parenting — the love is endless, but so is the noise.

I’ve realized I can’t change my kids’ need for attention (and honestly, I don’t want to).
But I can make it easier for myself to handle.

That’s why I created Mom&Dad Tracker — a small app that helps me stay mindful, track my emotions, and see patterns in our family days. It doesn’t silence the “Mom, look!” moments — it helps me stay calmer, grounded, and a little more human through them.

Parenting isn’t about perfection.
It’s about finding small ways to stay present — even when you’re tired, distracted, and pulled in every direction.

If you’ve ever whispered to yourself, “I just can’t anymore,” this is your reminder: you can. You’re doing great. And you’re not alone.

👉 Try Mom&Dad Tracker.
It might just give you back a little piece of calm in the beautiful mess of parenthood.",1,1760384673.0,u_Sad_Adagio_6794,0,1.0,False

1o5tz6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1o5tz6l/kindly_requesting_thoughts_feedback_to_my_approach/,Kindly requesting thoughts & feedback to my approach,"I've been carnivore for around a month now and I've gotta say, I'm already seeing some great results. From a consistently flat stomach to maintained energy levels and a massive reduction in brainfog, it's amazing to see how quickly this works. My goals are to maintain low bf % while gaining lean muscle, something that's considered the holy grail in the world of bodybuilding & fitness as it's always been touted as impossible to do unless you're on ""the gear"". However, health is also a big factor and very important to me – so undergoing this lifestyle is definitely not all about aesthetics to me. Before I outline my carnivore approach, some background info below. But if you don't want to read, look out for the **TLDR\*** lower down the post!

I'm a 34 y/o natural bodybuilder (5'9"" and around 72kg), and just came off a cut using the regular old CICO approach in August 2025 (I lost 20kg!). While I achieved some great results, it just wasn't sustainable to look like that in the way I was going about it all year round (especially having to maintain calorie counting). Feeling a little thinner than I would've liked, I decided to ""lean bulk"" for the rest of the year. However, this felt a little vague and aimless, especially as I didn't want to get fat again yet avoid counting calories at the same time. Thankfully, my YouTube algorithm allowed me rediscover the carnivore diet (I've evidently shown some interest in it in the past), and I took this as a sign to actually try it due to the claims of being able to maintain a low bf % while adding quality muscle, despite being an experienced lifter and not being able to benefit from ""newbie gains"".

It's not completely uncharted territory for me as I have eaten in a similar way before. 10+ years ago, I did something called Carb Backloading for around 2-3 years. It's essentially the same as carnivore for most of the day – the big exception being that you indulge in carbs post-workout on workout days. Even with this, I recall having great energy levels and achieving great results without even tracking calories, gaining muscle while maintaining around 15% bf. But that was a decade ago where I was younger with naturally more energy levels.

But now I'm aware of the downsides of ingesting carbs – even in a controlled window – and how the body can make its own glucose and thrive off its own fat energy source without any need of carbs to fuel or recover from a workout. And thanks to my experience with Carb Backloading, I generally enjoy the high fat + protein diet and have gotten used to this way of eating.

**TLDR\*** Now for my approach. I'm far from perfect, and while I'd love to reap the full benefits by going full-on ""lion"", I simply do not want to for several reasons. Therefore, my diet consists of beef (steak, mince), lamb (steak, mince, chops), pork (bacon), fish (salmon), eggs, cheese and butter. This allows for more variety and also isn't so dear on the wallet. I also have black coffee 1x-2x a day, which I know is divisive among the community.

All was going well until around 3 weeks in where I felt that I was undereating a tad. Maybe it was the adjustment period, but because of my goal of building muscle, I felt a little flat and somewhat catabolic. Bear in mind, I did feel full or at least content for most of each day and so there was no way I could squeeze another meal in (I eat twice a day during lunch and dinner).

However, since I ditched my protein shake, I decided to resurrect it, but this time purchase a 100% whey protein powder, with the only ingredient being milk (no flavourings, sweeteners or chemicals). I mix this with 100ml of full-fat, unhomogenised Jersey milk from grass-fed cows. Since including this, I feel as though I've primed my body to be able to reap the benefits a general carnivore diet has to offer, all while maintaining ketosis and feeling fully nourished, giving it what it needs to ensure strong workouts and adequate nutrients for recovery.

**With all this in mind, are there any adjustments you'd recommend?**

In summary, I eat and drink:

\- Beef (steak, mince)

\- Lamb (steak, mince, chops)

\- Pork (bacon)

\- Fish (salmon)

\- Eggs

\- Cheese

\- Butter

\- Full-fat, unhomogenised Jersey milk from grass-fed cows

\- Whey protein (100% whey with only one single ingredient: milk)

\- Black coffee

Apologies for all the info, I'm excited by this journey and want to ensure I'm doing what I can to reap its full rewards while allowing some level of flexibility and options.

We are finally ready to get one but I am overwhelmed by the options. I need something kid friendly (I.e. no sharp corners and not so expensive that I’ll be paranoid every time they play on it). My husband would love something lightweight we easily move if we want to use the floor space. What do you suggest?

I’ve been using this kettle for about a week and a half now and honestly, it’s quickly become one of my favorite brewing tools. Right out of the box, it felt solid the build is sturdy, the handle is nicely balanced and it gives off a really premium vibe overall.

The temperature control is spot on what you set is exactly what you get, which makes a big difference when brewing pour over coffee. It heats up fast too hitting my usual range (90–93°C) takes barely a couple of minutes.

Pouring with it feels incredibly smooth and controlled. The gooseneck design gives such good precision that I can pour steadily without the stream breaking or splashing perfect for fine tuning my pour over technique.

I also love the thoughtful details, like the built in timer for blooming and brewing and the memory function that remembers my last temperature. They’re small things, but they make everyday use that much easier.

Overall, this kettle has honestly gone beyond what I expected. If you’re into manual brewing and want something reliable, stylish and precise. This one’s absolutely worth it.",1,1760384180.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

My husband and I just moved across the country to the Bay Area, and I knew I'd want to transition my own career around that time too.

I started my transition by doing an unpaid internship for a media company in social media and influencer marketing. I thought that would be a good way to start building my resume and portfolio. I'm now freelancing and working with a client directly on her socials, but it barely pays anything and I am in desperate need of full-time work. I also constantly apply for more freelance gigs on UpWork but never get any replies.

I've applied for hundreds of roles and have gotten maybe 1-2 interviews (that obviously ended in rejection). I have networked as much as humanly possible, attending events with marketing professionals, doing one-on-one coffee chats, and requesting people to connect on LinkedIn at companies I'm interested in. I've also exhausted my network of people I know IRL, but to no avail. Many people accept my LinkedIn requests, but once I send a message or email, don't ever reply. I have never once gotten a response to an InMail message or outreach email I've sent, and I've sent tons. So many jobs and companies don't even list any contact info, so sometimes I have no way to reach out even if I wanted to.

I've worked with a few career coaches who have helped me reformat my LinkedIn, write cover letters, and rewrite my resume, and still no luck. I've probably spent $1000 on services like these at this point, all for nothing. I even spent hours making a presentation-format portfolio like I've seen many other social media marketers do, with no luck.

I am officially at my breaking point. I feel like a crazy person putting in all this work and getting absolutely no response from anyone (other than the occasional automated rejection from a no-reply@ email). I've done what feels like everything I can do at this point to put myself out there and make my applications stand out, but I've had absolutely no luck. I don't have the capacity for more unpaid work at this point because I'm barely paying my bills and time spent doing unpaid work is time taking away from applications or other side hustles (I don't qualify for unemployment since I left education willingly). I've even had two job applications where the hiring manager seemed interested, only to get completely ghosted and stood up for interviews. I am so exhausted and frustrated.

Is there some secret I'm missing here? I'm losing my mind.",1,1760383967.0,jobsearch,0,1.0,False

1o5toni,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1o5toni/water_pools_in_portafilterbasket_bambino_plus/,Water pools in portafilter/basket [Bambino Plus],"Hi all! I bought a new Bambino Plus and the first cup I made was wonderful. However, the second cup (two cup mode), no espresso dispensed. Zero drops. So I tried running a single up, and tiny bit (but not a normal amount) dispensed. After testing reducing the amount of ground coffee in the filter, I tried running two cup mode again and no espresso came out.

I tested running just hot water (no coffee) through a single wall basket as well as double wall basket, and some water comes through, but the majority of it stays pooled in the basket until I unlock it, whereupon it drains through the bottom normally. I tried running the machine without the portafilter, the shower screen seems to send water through in a normal fashion.

I feel like there's some kind of pressure issue? I \*don't\* think it's an issue with the way I'm preparing the grounds. It's strange to me that the water is just pooling in the basket until I unlock it.

Other things I've tried in trouble shooting:

\- running single cup, double cup modes

\- running the steam wand

\- unplugging and replugging the machine

\- scrubbing the basket/filter

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

  
EDIT:

Ok maybe I'm figuring it out, the water pooling in a coffee-less pour is normal? I tried going from a 15 to a 20 grind on the Baratza Encore ESP and it seems to be working much more to my expectations (actually pouring coffee lol).",1,1760383925.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1o5toko,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1o5toko/beans_lots_of_them_im_now_apparently_running_a/,Beans. Lots of them. I'm now apparently running a one-man cafe that never opens to the public.,"Turns out I’m living that recent Reddit post — got a little too hyped and bought a *mountain* of beans. Impulsiveness got the better of me, and here we are.

The thing is, I already had a pretty high bean inventory since I just got home from the EU. I usually go through about 30g a day, but that jumps to 45–60g on weekends when friends come over (and we pretend we’re running a café). I also tend to give single-dosed coffee to some of my friends, so that somehow takes a portion away from this chaos.

To make things even spicier, all the incoming beans are from roasters I’ve never tried before, and many are coferments or experimental lots — because I thought I wanted to be adventurous and overwhelmed at the same time.

I’ve never frozen beans before, mostly because my “bean cellar” has never looked like this level of caffeine-induced chaos. Naturally, I consulted the expert in all things, ChatGPT, to help me strategize on which beans to freeze and how to rotate them so it doesn’t feel (or taste) redundant.

If you were in my shoes, how would you handle the rotation? What’s your experience with the roasters I’ve listed below? Do you notice a big difference between freshly roasted vs. properly frozen beans when you thaw them later on? What’s your thawing ritual — fridge overnight, countertop, or straight from the freezer into the grinder? How long have you successfully kept beans frozen without flavor loss? Most importantly, please, tell me I did okay with my purchases — my wallet and I could use the validation.

1o5tmyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1o5tmyd/wibta_for_exposing_my_friend_for_trying_to_cheat/,WIBTA For Exposing My Friend For Trying To Cheat On His Girlfriend By Asking Me To Be His Mistress,"I (22F) am wanting to expose my friend, who we will call Kevin (24M), for wanting to cheat on his girlfriend by wanting me to be his mistress. 

For context Kevin and I have been friends for about 2 years. I met him through my ex-best friend, who we will call Lucy. They used to date but broke up last year October. I never knew about the break up until Kevin told me about it 2 weeks after. I told both of them I would not be picking sides as they are both my friends, however Lucy believed I chose Kevin’s side, hence ex-best friend. Kevin liked me and would often flirt with me but I was in a relationship with my now husband, so I constantly rejected him. 

Now for the main story. I hadn’t spoken to Kevin since February (reason being he was horrible to me the day of my car accident). About a week ago he contacted me to find out how I’m doing and if I wanted to grab coffee sometime. I pretty much told him I have been busy with work and studying and didn’t have the time. This morning I received a message from him stating he was destroyed, to which I ask what happened, he began by telling me how he was broken that his ex, Lucy, had a threesome on the weekend and how it is breaking his heart. I was kind of annoyed as it has been a year since their break up and clearly she had moved on. He once again asked can we go for coffee, but in his message he tried to gaslight me by telling me I’m choosing her side and I never make time for him. My husband was the one to tell me I should go get coffee with him and find out what his true intentions were with me. 

After he fetched me at my place he began talking about Lucy. The reason he was so broken was because since the break up she lost weight, starting studying, and hooking up with guys and Kevin was not happy with this because in their relationship he tried to encourage her to gym, to study and most of all encourage her to have a threesome, she didn’t want to do any of those however she agreed to the threesome as long as it was me. There was no way in Hell I would be doing that. I also was apparently the reason they broke up.

He continued to say how much he still loves her and his feelings were hurt. All i could say was she had moved on and he should to. He did not like this comment. We ended that conversation and spoke a bit about how our lives are going. That stopped short. Kevin then asked do I have any single friends. I only have one and she is into MUCH older guys. He then dropped that conversation and changed the subject to work. 

Now for the fun part. HE IS IN A RELATIONSHIP. I was shocked this man has been talking about how he still loves Lucy and is looking for single women. He tells me how much this woman is perfect for him in everything except she cannot satisfy his needs. He claims she is too fragile for him. He told me he needs a mistress to satisfy him AND PROCEEDS TO ASK ME WOULD I BE HIS MISTRESS. He tried to convince me by even saying we should have a threesome just so he can feel something. I was not pleased with this and once again said I am married. He has never liked my husband and tried to tell me he isn’t even good looking, obviously I defended my husband. 

He asked me what attracted me to my husband, simple rundown: everything. I told him he never judges me even when I get new tattoos or specific piercings, which I should not say, everyone knew I wanted these piercings including Kevin. He had the audacity to ask me can he see them. HELL NO. I said they are for my husband to see and not for anyone else. He got soo jealous and kept saying it is not fair because he wanted to see them and wanted to play with them. At this point I was getting uncomfortable and annoyed, so I changed the subject and started talking about family. Before we could continue this man ***king shows me his girlfriends nudes and sex tape. I was shocked. I just said I didn’t want to see them and to put it away because we were in public. Clearly he was trying to convince me to have a threesome by showing me her indisposed body. 

Now at this point i just want to leave however he sat there and asked me to contact one of my single friends, I insisted I had none, he asked do I know if anyone has a single friend. I made the unfortunate mistake of saying my BIL might know someone. This man made me show him my text messages to my BIL asking does he have single friends. Now I am Done. I messaged my BIL asking but right after that changed the subject to anime which he finally stuck to this conversation. 

After 3 pain-staking hours we left the cafè and he dropped me off at home. As a loyal and loving wife I told my husband everything. He was livid because Kevin kept making sexual comments to me asking me to have a threesome with him. I immediately messaged my BIL to not send me any numbers of single women because i was not comfortable with it. Thank the heavens my BIL was such a saint for wanting to rip off this mans manhood. 

I finally blocked and deleted Kevin. If I am being honest I really want to send his girlfriend a “hey girlie” text however if I think about if this man cheats on her one day she will find out because girls have a sense for these things. 

Should I send her a “hey Girlie” text or should I leave it for Her to discover. 

So the question is WIBTA for exposing him for trying to cheat on his girlfriend by wanting me to be his mistress?

I’ve been dealing with this weird issue for over a year and I’m getting really frustrated.

I’ve done so many urine cultures and BV tests and they always come back negative. Every time I use a home UTI test strip it shows positive for white blood cells but negative for nitrites. I’ve taken 2 or 3 full rounds of antibiotics and they never really stopped it from coming back.

It happens about every two months. It’s always the day after sex, usually in the morning after I drink iced coffee. I’ll feel a sharp pain or burning around the vaginal or urethra area, sometimes a bit of cramping or even loose stools. The pain usually goes away within the same day, but I’ll feel a bit irritated for a week after.

Once or twice I even had a bit of blood in my urine at the very end, but that also went away the same day.

I’ve had a ton of tests with my OB-GYN, like Pap smear, pelvic and kidney ultrasound, even an endometrial biopsy, and everything looked normal.

I have high DHEA and insulin resistance, so I take fish oil, vitamin D3, Yasmin, and inositol. Since starting these, the symptoms are milder but they still come back. I usually take Azo for relief when it happens.

At this point I’m starting to think this isn’t a normal UTI, because it always starts fast, goes away fast, and nothing shows up in the tests. I haven’t seen a urologist yet, but maybe I should?

Has anyone had something similar? It always happens after sex and iced coffee. I’m so tired of feeling like something’s wrong but every test says I’m fine. Any advice or experience would mean a lot.",1,1760383789.0,utis,0,1.0,False

1o5td7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/FTMOver30/comments/1o5td7y/from_im_to_subq_back_to_im_inj/,From IM to SUB-Q & back to IM inj,"I have been wanting to post this for the longest time but I waited for a few months to see if my symptoms were just coincidence or not. As a summary, I started IM inj on my thigh from 2013 to 2017 and from 2017 up to May 2025, I switched from IM to sub-Q on my stomach bec I couldn't take the pain and anxiety of that big needle going in my leg, sometimes when I inject, I would hit some nerves I guess bec my muscle starts to twitch.
During my SUB-Q injection years, after 1 year, I noticed I started to have this ""hive-like"" appearance around my belly button, it lasted for more than a month and I tried not to touch or scratch it, but then it went away. I also started to have bloating issues, my body was aching, I feel like there's some air traveling around my body even to my back, it was pretty bad to the point where I was having difficulty breathing, it only lasted for few hours. This bloating has recurred after another 6 months, and then I noticed the bloating recurrs more often with shorter month interval and when it happens, it lasts longer hours until it lasts for the whole day and sometimes 2.5 days. I sometimes think what did I eat last that my stomach was having reactions with. I was worried, I thought maybe I have gastritis, or some kind of illness, ulcer or GERD bec most often when this bloating happens, I would feel like my food goes back up and I would taste that sour taste at the back of my throat. So I started to change my diet, avoiding foods that can make my stomach acidic, switched my coffee to decaf, I also went to a Gastroenterologist and he did gastroscopy, he also took some biopsy but all the results came back normal; and yet, this bloating is still there, something is wrong.
While this was happening, I've also noticed my BP was getting higher to the point of my doc might be prescribing me meds soon, cholesterol was high too, and I needed to decrease it by changing my diet further and doing more exercises, after 2 months, checked on my labs, BP was still the same except my cholesterol improved. So I did a look back on my BP results from when I started taking T, it was higher than before taking T but consistently at that level where it is still okay, then it started to go even higher when I switched to SUB-Q so I was like maybe I should switch back to IM and see if it goes to where it was before? I know it is pretty far from logic but I was just trying to make sense of my labs. So I started to switch back to IM injection on my buttocks by the end of May 2025, a month later, I experienced this bloating again, but this time it only lasted for few hours and not days. Another month past by, another bloating occurence but this time it was only mild. Eversince then, I haven't had anymore bloating! I am eating like I used to, no more restricted diet although I'm still drinking decaf, and my BP went a bit lower. Who could have thought?! I'm like dumb founded about this bec this is sooo wild? Who could have thought that my SUB-Q has affected all of these symptoms? Nothing in books nor the internet says anything about these and it's just weird that by simply changing my route of injection has internal and physiological effects? Anyways this is only my experience, I'm just curious if there's anyone out there who has the same reactions as mine?",1,1760383230.0,FTMOver30,0,1.0,False

I'd sit down to work and within 5 minutes, my brain would feel like it was swimming through mud. I'd read the same paragraph four times and retain nothing. I'd start a task, get distracted, switch to something else, then forget what I was doing in the first place.

For two years, I genuinely considered getting tested for ADHD. I tried every productivity hack—Pomodoro technique, time blocking, focus music, standing desks. Nothing worked for more than a day or two.

Then I discovered something that changed everything: **I didn't have a focus problem. I had a cognitive load problem.**

Your brain has a limited capacity for processing information—think of it like RAM in a computer. When you overload it with too many inputs, decisions, and competing priorities, it doesn't matter how much discipline you have. **Your brain literally cannot focus because it's already maxed out.**

After understanding this, I went from barely managing 45 minutes of focused work to consistently doing 3-4 hour deep work sessions. My brain fog disappeared. Tasks that used to take me all day now take 90 minutes.

Here are the 8 cognitive load traps that were destroying my focus (and probably yours too).

# Trap 1: Decision Fatigue Before You Even Start

Every morning I'd waste 30 minutes deciding what to work on first. Should I answer emails? Start that project? Make a to-do list? Each micro-decision was draining my mental energy before I'd done any actual work.

**The science:** Your brain uses the same mental resources for decisions as it does for focused work. Every choice—no matter how small—depletes your cognitive capacity.

**The fix:** Decide your top 3 tasks the night before. Don't negotiate with yourself in the morning. Just start with task #1. This single change gave me back 2 hours of peak mental energy per week.

# Trap 2: Open Loops (The Invisible Focus Killer)

I'd sit down to write, but in the back of my mind I'm thinking: ""Did I respond to that email? I need to book that appointment. What was that thing I was supposed to remember?""

These ""open loops""—unfinished tasks floating in your subconscious—are constantly draining processing power even when you're not actively thinking about them.

**The science:** The Zeigarnik Effect shows that your brain dedicates background processing to incomplete tasks. It's like having 20 apps running in the background of your phone.

**The fix:** Brain dump every morning. Spend 5 minutes writing down every single thing bouncing around your head. Get it out of your brain and onto paper. Your mind will stop using precious mental energy trying to remember everything.

# Trap 3: Context Switching (The Productivity Destroyer)

Checking Slack while writing a report. Responding to a text mid-task. Glancing at your email ""just for a second."" I used to do this 30-40 times a day without realizing it.

**The science:** Every time you switch contexts, your brain needs 15-23 minutes to fully re-engage with the original task. This is called ""attention residue."" Part of your brain is still thinking about the last thing you looked at.

**The fix:** One task, one window, one focus at a time. I literally close every app except the one I'm using. My phone goes in another room. First two weeks felt impossible. Now it's automatic, and my productivity tripled.

# Trap 4: Too Many Active Projects

At my worst, I was simultaneously trying to: learn Spanish, start a side business, read 3 books, work on 5 different projects, plan a trip, reorganize my apartment. I was making zero progress on any of it.

**The science:** Working memory can only handle 3-5 active items at once. Everything beyond that creates cognitive overwhelm and decision paralysis.

**The fix:** The ""Rule of 3."" Maximum 3 active projects at any time. Everything else goes on a ""someday/maybe"" list. Sounds limiting, but I've accomplished more in the last 6 months using this rule than I did in the previous 2 years trying to do everything at once.

# Trap 5: Information Overload (Consumption Without Integration)

Podcasts during my commute. YouTube while eating. Articles during breaks. Reddit before bed. I was consuming 8-10 hours of information daily but retaining almost nothing. My brain was in constant input mode with zero time to process.

**The science:** Your brain consolidates information during rest periods. Constant information consumption prevents memory formation and pattern recognition—the foundation of actual learning and insight.

**The fix:** Implement ""white space."" 30 minutes daily with zero information input. No music, no podcasts, no reading. Just walking, sitting, or doing mundane tasks. This is when your brain actually processes everything you've learned. My creativity and problem-solving ability shot up after adding this.

# Trap 6: Environmental Chaos

My desk was a disaster. Piles of papers, 5 coffee cups, random cables, post-it notes everywhere. I told myself ""I know where everything is"" but my brain was spending energy processing visual clutter every single second.

**The science:** Visual complexity increases cognitive load. Your brain subconsciously processes everything in your environment, stealing resources from actual focused work.

**The fix:** Clear your workspace completely before starting. Only the task you're working on should be visible. Sounds stupidly simple, but the difference is immediate. My focus improved the same day I cleared my desk.

# Trap 7: Notification Interruptions (Even When You Ignore Them)

I thought I had discipline because I wouldn't always check notifications immediately. But here's what I didn't realize: **just seeing the notification was breaking my focus.** The buzz, the flash, the red dot—each one was pulling my attention away.

**The science:** Even if you don't check a notification, your brain still processes the interruption, creates an open loop (""what was that?""), and disrupts your flow state.

**The fix:** Nuclear option—turn off ALL notifications except phone calls. Not on silent. Off. If something is truly urgent, people will call. Everything else can wait 2 hours. This was the hardest change I made and also the most impactful.

# Trap 8: No Recovery Time Between Focused Sessions

I used to power through 8-hour work days with maybe a 10-minute lunch break, wondering why my brain felt fried by 2pm. Turns out, your brain isn't designed to focus continuously.

**The science:** Your prefrontal cortex (responsible for focus and willpower) depletes with use and needs recovery. Pushing through actually decreases productivity and increases errors.

**The fix:** 90-minute work blocks with real 15-minute breaks. During breaks: move your body, step outside, or do something completely different. No scrolling social media (that's not a break for your brain—it's just different work). After implementing this, my productive hours went from 3 per day to 6-7.

# How Long Does It Take to Fix This?

I'm not gonna lie—the first week sucked. My brain threw a tantrum every time I closed extra tabs or turned off notifications. I felt anxious and weirdly exposed without constant stimulation.

But around **day 10, something clicked.** Tasks that used to feel overwhelming started feeling manageable. That mental fog I'd lived with for years just... lifted. By **day 30**, I was consistently getting more done in 3 focused hours than I used to accomplish in an entire day of distracted work.

The most unexpected benefit? My anxiety dropped significantly. Turns out most of my stress wasn't from having too much to do—it was from my brain being overloaded trying to track everything at once.

The app I used [This app](https://unnionapp.page.link/QsVV)—it's basically a reminder system that pings you during your vulnerable hours.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Boulogne vs. Guingamp: A Tale of Two Turtles in a Race for Ligue 2 Glory**

The upcoming Ligue 2 clash between Boulogne and Guingamp on October 17, 2025, is shaping up to be a statistical chess match where the only thing more balanced than the odds is a tightrope walker’s coffee cup. Let’s dissect this like a French chef dissects a soufflé—precision, flair, and a dash of chaos.

### Parse the Odds: A Dead Heat in the Odds Derby

The bookmakers have priced this like a coin flip with a side of doubt. Boulogne and Guingamp are nearly even-money favorites across the board, with Boulogne hovering at **2.50** (implied probability: **40%**) and Guingamp at **2.55** (implied probability: **39.2%**). The draw? A tidy **3.35**, implying a **30%** chance—enough to make you question why you’re not betting on rain in a desert.

The total goals market is equally split, with “Under 2.5” and “Over 2.5” hovering around **1.85-1.90**, suggesting a game where defenses will play the role of overzealous parents at a toddler’s birthday party—*very* protective, *very* cautious.

### Digest the News: Where’s the Drama?

Recent news? Thin as a baguette on a diet. Boulogne’s last reported action involved a “tough challenge” at St. Vincent de Bragny (a place where even GPS admits defeat), while Guingamp’s updates are as vague as a politician’s promise. No injuries, no transfers, no scandals—just two teams existing in a footballing limbo.

One notable tidbit: Boulogne’s home form is as reliable as a Frenchman’s sense of direction in a

TEL AVIV — With cautious optimism and mild confusion, Israeli officials today marked the nation’s 1,800th consecutive minute of not bombing another country, a historic milestone in the region’s brief but celebrated tradition of peace measured in hours.

The accomplishment, which began shortly after a Trump-brokered ceasefire took effect Friday evening, has already shattered multiple national and international records. By mid-morning Monday, the Israel Defense Forces confirmed that no foreign airspace had been violated, no ordnance had been dropped, and no residential towers had been “inadvertently vaporized in accordance with standard procedure.”

The streak has electrified the nation. Across Tel Aviv, citizens gathered in cafés and public squares to count along, their phones open to live “Peace Tracker” dashboards maintained by local news outlets. “It’s like watching the World Cup, but fewer people die,” said one man in Hostages Square. Still, the tone of the proceedings was not without a certain unease, as the Israeli people enter uncharted waters.

Officials credit the achievement to President Donald Trump, who received a standing ovation in the Knesset for his “unparalleled commitment to The Arab Question” Addressing the chamber Monday morning, Trump declared the Gaza War “officially over, done, wrapped up, probably forever,” adding that “Israel is entering its golden age, and I personally told them to give peace a try, at least until lunch.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the development “a triumph of modern diplomacy,” reminding reporters that “sometimes the absence of explosions is itself a kind of explosion, of progress.”

World leaders praised the streak as a “bold experiment in short-term diplomacy.” The United Nations issued a statement congratulating Israel on “demonstrating that peace, however brief, remains theoretically possible.” A special U.N. clock tracking minutes-since-last-bombing was upgraded from digital to analog after exceeding its previous two-digit display limit. Egypt’s foreign minister, speaking from Sharm el-Sheikh where the ceasefire was signed, expressed cautious optimism: “If the current pace continues, Israel could reach 2,000 minutes by sundown. That’s nearly a full Christopher Nolan film without an air raid.”

Within Israel, the newfound tranquility has inspired both relief and unease. Parents report children playing outdoors “without fear, but also without focus.” Cafés have introduced peace specials, offering half-priced\* coffee for every additional hour without a bombing run. A Tel Aviv yoga studio hosted a “Mindful Deterrence” workshop, encouraging participants to “find the Gaza within, and bomb it gently.”

At press time, air-raid sirens briefly sounded across northern Israel, prompting widespread panic before officials clarified that the alarms were “part of a scheduled drill to help citizens maintain their normal routines.” The Peace Tracker briefly reset to zero before recalibrating at 1,812 minutes and counting.

Parents report children playing outdoors “without fear, but also without focus.” Cafés have introduced peace specials, offering half-priced\* coffee for every additional hour without a bombing run. A Tel Aviv yoga studio hosted a “Mindful Deterrence” workshop, encouraging participants to “find the Gaza within, and bomb it gently.”

At press time, air-raid sirens briefly sounded across northern Israel, prompting widespread panic before officials clarified that the alarms were “part of a scheduled drill to help citizens maintain their normal routines.” The Peace Tracker briefly reset to zero before recalibrating at 1,812 minutes and counting.

Alarm buzzes. Coffee. Commute. Click-clack-click. Commute back. Nuke a dinner. Binge a show. Zone out. Repeat.

Sound familiar? It’s the gorgeous, pre-packaged life-in-a-blender we’ve all been handed, a hamster wheel that just so happens to have better Wi-Fi and student loans. But here's the plot twist you were never meant to figure out: this whole setup is a feature, not a bug. It was *designed*.

The great industrialist John D. Rockefeller famously said, ""I don't want a nation of thinkers, I want a nation of workers."" Let that marinate for a second. The quiet part was screamed through a megaphone. The memo was clear: ""We need your hands, not your head. Your time, not your untamed, world-changing talent. Your brain is a lovely accessory, but please, don't let it interfere with production.""

Why? Because a thinker is inconvenient. A creator is a wild card. A person lit up with passion can't be easily controlled or sold the next shiny distraction. They want to be the sole architects of reality, the tastemakers who decide what you desire and what you purchase. Your unique, messy, brilliant creative genius is the one thing that throws a wrench in their perfect, profitable machine.

But here’s the radical, beautiful truth they pray you forget: this entire reality is an illusion, and you’re holding the master key. It’s called your free will.

You can absolutely hijack this system. The rebellion doesn’t start with a picket sign; it starts with your wallet. In a world of hypnotic, one-click consumption, the most revolutionary act is to simply… stop. That moment you walk past the fast-fashion top, the gadget you don’t need, the overpriced coffee—that isn't deprivation. That is a declaration of independence. That is you taking your power back, one intentional dollar at a time.

Let's be real: they *want* you living paycheck to paycheck. An indebted, exhausted person doesn’t have the bandwidth to build an empire, write a book, or start a movement. They just have enough energy to clock in tomorrow. It’s the most elegant trap ever designed.

So you’re at a crossroads. Option A: Stay on the wheel. It's safe, predictable. Option B: You step off. And I won't lie to you, the ground will feel shaky at first. This isn't an overnight glow-up; it's a renaissance. It demands years of devotion to your craft, to finding what sets your soul ablaze and forging it into your freedom. It means treating your savings like a sacred temple, a vault where you store the bricks to build the life you actually want. This isn’t just about money; it’s your ""get out of jail free"" fund for a life you didn’t choose.

The most liberating secret is that the cage door has been open this entire time. No one is making you do anything. You hold the power, and you never have to relinquish it.

So let this be your manifesto. Starve the consumer and feed the creator. Let them keep their fleeting trends and empty promises. You are here to build a legacy. Stop buying their dream and start funding your own.

Because this world doesn’t need another mindless shopper. It is desperately, passionately crying out for new philosophers, for renegade artists, for authentic, unapologetic free thinkers. This generation needs its visionaries. It’s crying out for you! ",1,1760382886.0,u_OpenYourThirdEyeNow1,0,1.0,False
1o5t70x,https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/1o5t70x/from_im_to_subq_and_back_to_im_inj/,From IM to SUB-Q and back to IM inj,"I have been wanting to post this for the longest time but I waited for a few months to see if my symptoms were just coincidence or not. As a summary, I started IM inj on my thigh from 2013 to 2017 and from 2017 up to May 2025, I switched from IM to sub-Q on my stomach bec I couldn't take the pain and anxiety of that big needle going in my leg, sometimes when I inject, I would hit some nerves I guess bec my muscle starts to twitch.
During my SUB-Q injection years, after 1 year, I noticed I started to have this ""hive-like"" appearance around my belly button, it lasted for more than a month and I tried not to touch or scratch it, but then it went away. I also started to have bloating issues, my body was aching, I feel like there's some air traveling around my body even to my back, it was pretty bad to the point where I was having difficulty breathing, it only lasted for few hours. This bloating has recurred after another 6 months, and then I noticed the bloating recurrs more often with shorter month interval and when it happens, it lasts longer hours until it lasts for the whole day and sometimes 2.5 days. I sometimes think what did I eat last that my stomach was having reactions with. I was worried, I thought maybe I have gastritis, or some kind of illness, ulcer or GERD bec most often when this bloating happens, I would feel like my food goes back up and I would taste that sour taste at the back of my throat. So I started to change my diet, avoiding foods that can make my stomach acidic, switched my coffee to decaf, I also went to a Gastroenterologist and he did gastroscopy, he also took some biopsy but all the results came back normal; and yet, this bloating is still there, something is wrong.
While this was happening, I've also noticed my BP was getting higher to the point of my doc might be prescribing me meds soon, cholesterol was high too, and I needed to decrease it by changing my diet further and doing more exercises, after 2 months, checked on my labs, BP was still the same except my cholesterol improved. So I did a look back on my BP results from when I started taking T, it was higher than before taking T but consistently at that level where it is still okay, then it started to go even higher when I switched to SUB-Q so I was like maybe I should switch back to IM and see if it goes to where it was before? I know it is pretty far from logic but I was just trying to make sense of my labs. So I started to switch back to IM injection on my buttocks by the end of May 2025, a month later, I experienced this bloating again, but this time it only lasted for few hours and not days. Another month past by, another bloating occurence but this time it was only mild. Eversince then, I haven't had anymore bloating! I am eating like I used to, no more restricted diet although I'm still drinking decaf, and my BP went a bit lower. Who could have thought?! I'm like dumb founded about this bec this is sooo wild? Who could have thought that my SUB-Q has affected all of these symptoms? Nothing in books nor the internet says anything about these and it's just weird that by simply changing my route of injection has internal and physiological effects? Anyways this is only my experience, I'm just curious if there's anyone out there who has the same reactions as mine?",1,1760382860.0,ftm,1,1.0,False

UPDATE: I tried to talk to him in the morning and he said... I said what I said. Didn't want to talk about it. Got up and went to work. I texted him that I am taking the kids and I will be staying for a few days in a friend's apartament

We’ve been married for 3 years and we have two children. His career is his top priority. He has climbed to the top of the hierarchy in a very large company

We met a few years ago when I was working at the same company. He is Polish and I am Slovak. We in Slovakia have been some sort of outsourcing for the plant in Poland that he was leading. He always spoke down to my department because customer service it seems is very low. I knew from my boss that he said we are "" trash"". But it wasn't personal for me at that point. I did meet him face to face when he was probably ""forced"" by headquarters to come to Slovakia and meet us. He didn't even answer to my hello. not to my colleagues. He did go out for a coffee with the leader of the customer service but nothing more.

I wanted more and I moved to Poland myself internally, directly to the plant. We basically got to know each other from scratch — he had divorced recently. I was 26 and he was my ""first"" so maybe I didn't ask all the right questions out of inexperience. I don't regret marrying him, but I feel I need to address some stuff

Even at the plant there were like 7 layers between us. I am in no managerial position. But we met actually outside of the office - its a medium size city and we started talking. Due to internal regulations I changed companies so I can have a real relationship with him. He helped me to find a job somewhere else and we became official. Got married within a year. And he helped me get back at the plant too, nothing prestigious. Just back on the position I was in. I didn't ask for favours. I don't report to him, but we found a workaround and I report to the headquarters.

We have a daughter and a son. Our daughter is only a few months old. He barely spends any time with them, but now he wants another baby. He comes home always tired, always irritated, and he has daily conflicts with his subordinates. He doesn’t waste time with friends; when he’s not at the office or out working, he’s home with us, but he’s either sleeping or on his phone, always talking about work and stressed out. I will return to work soon, so at the plant he leads and I checked some emails, looking for key words. I found an email with a long chain and at the bottom of it was an email from him saying that all those... Sl0vaks are doing tr#sh work and he wants to get rid of them because they are all a bunch of barely out of high school ""philosophy"" students who came here to take our people's jobs. He has 2 Slovak children basically.",3,1760382675.0,WhatShouldIDo,4,0.8,False

   The smell of coffee and hissing of milk being frothed filled the air. The glow of my computer strained my eyes as I clicked apply on what felt like the millionth job application that day.
   “How many of these do I have to submit before someone actually responds?”
   Charlie shook her head at me.
    “You’ve only been at it a week, Natalie, give it some time. Someone will get back to you soon.”
   A creative writing degree doesn’t get you anywhere with recruiters and being fired from your first and only job in your field really doesn’t sweeten the deal at all.
   “Order for Natalie!” the teenage barista calls out over the loud hum of the espresso machines and early 2000’s pop-punk.
    She placed my drink on the counter and walked away before I could ask for a straw.
   As I returned to my laptop, an email notification popped up:
   We’ve reviewed your application and would like to interview you as soon as possible. Please choose from the following available appointments below to schedule.
Tuesday November 4th 8am
Thursday November 13th 10am
Thursday November 20th 10am
   “A fashion designer wants to interview me as soon as tomorrow. This seems weird, I only applied with them an hour ago.”
   Charlie scowled.
   “You were just complaining about not getting responses and now you get one and you’re complaining about that too? Really Natalie, I don’t know what to do with you sometimes. You need a job and they’re offering to interview you practically immediately, you should be stoked!”
   My eyes and temples ached.
   “You’re right,” I rubbed the bridge of my nose, “If I take the appointment tomorrow morning could you drop me off? It looks like their office is in the city. I can order a ride share after.”
   “Yeah, of course. My shift starts at ten so make sure you figure out a ride home, I won’t be able to come to your rescue!” Charlie made light of it but I knew she was being serious. She’s had to save me one too many times.
   “Alright, well I’m headed home so I can prepare, see you tomorrow.”
   My enthusiasm was lacking and Charlie was irritated but encouraging still.
   “I’ll pick you up at seven! Remember, this is a good thing!”


   I took the scenic route home, a small trail right over the ocean on cliffs overtaken by vegetation. I contemplated going surfing instead of researching the job I’d be interviewing for tomorrow, but imagining Charlie’s face if I did was enough to snuff the idea out. It’d suffice to stop and sit on a bench for a while and watch the waves roll in.
   Thoughts of how I ended up here began to ruminate as I lost myself in the ocean’s lull.
   I started working at a tech company right out of college, starting in their communications department working my way up to brand manager. Other employees called me a nepo baby because my dad played golf with our CEO and pulled some strings to get me an entry level position, but I had truly worked my way up. I was their brand manager for just over a year before I decided to blow up my own life.
   I’d received an offer from a competitor, one that appeared life changing, one that would give me the opportunity to achieve what I’d set out to do from the beginning of my career and start my own PR firm. 
   The only catch being that they wanted information on a project my company had been working on over the last decade, something to do with a deep learning AI that was going to be used in medical research and development. I wasn’t part of the project directly, but I had enough access to information on it to give them what they wanted. 
   Eighty-four-thousand a year with little to no chance of a raise didn’t seem like proper compensation for the amount of hours and work I put in and it definitely wasn’t enough for all of the idiots I had to oversee. A thirty-thousand dollar sign on bonus plus a ten-thousand dollar raise to betray a billionaire tech company didn’t seem like a bad trade.
   So I did it.
   I handed over confidential files on the biggest project in the company’s history.
   And of course I received nothing in return. The competitors took the information and ran.
   My insurrection was discovered almost immediately. I was terminated on the spot, made to do the walk of shame carrying my entire office packed into two cardboard boxes that once held printer paper, and before I even made it to my car my phone was blowing up. 
   Dad was pissed. He called me an embarrassment to our family name, told me never to ask him for anything again, to never even speak to him again. 
   “You’re a fucking disgrace, Natalie. An empty-headed, mindless disgrace.”
   The last words he said to me still bounce around in my mind.
   That was nine months ago. I depleted my savings sitting on my ass and feeling sorry for myself.
   I started my job hunt and faked my resume by saying I’ve been working at the restaurant Charlie manages for the last eight years and included my personal writing projects as my “writing experience”. 
   Stupid.
   A stray dog approached, sniffing my legs and interrupting my self loathing.
   “Shit, what time is it?”
   I’d been sitting there for almost two hours.
   “So much for not wasting time,” I rolled my eyes, self loathing flooding back in.
   I walked up the pathway to my front door, past the broken down Porsche that sat miserably in my driveway, a gift from Dad at my college graduation. It stopped running about a month ago and I couldn’t afford a mechanic, so I tried working on it myself with the help of YouTube videos and what little information I could get out of the guy at the nearest auto shop, but I’m sure I made things worse. Now it just sits there, its shimmery white paint fading to a dusty grey under the smog and dust collecting on its surface.
   I jiggled the key in the janky lock of my front door, trying to get the old knob to respond when a loud thump startled me.
   Something moved beneath my window sill, behind the lilies my mother had planted.
   I crouched and pulled back the flowers, revealing a small brown bird.
   Its legs pulsed rhythmically, its twitching and flopping desperate, slapping the ground with tiny thuds that ripped through the quiet evening.  Its dark eyes beckoned me in silent despair.
   Its convulsions slowed and came to a halt.
   It gasped once more and stiffened.
   I watched, hoping it would move again.
   But it didn’t.
   The eyes that gazed at me rolled in their sockets as I stood, backing away.
   I rang my neighbors doorbell and waited with a hand pressed to my sternum, nausea threatening me.
   Adam came to the door looking disheveled, his salt and pepper hair standing on end, his face red and creased with pillow lines.
   “Natalie, you look like you’ve seen a ghost,” he rubbed one eye and looked around me with the other, searching for the culprit. He knows I really only come over if I need something, but he doesn’t seem to mind it.
   “There’s a dead bird in my flower bed. I’m not sure what to do.”
   Adam looked at me with a raised eyebrow, but seeing my distress he hurried outside and grabbed a garden shovel that leaned against his porch railing.
   “I’ll handle it, you go inside and don’t worry about it,” his gravely voice was reassuring.
   I flipped on the lamp in my entryway, its dim yellow light pouring into the living room.
   Above the kitchen sink was the window the bird had crashed into, and just outside Adam was digging a hole. Turning my back to the scene and opening my fridge I found nothing but a single stick of butter, a molding package of deli meat, and a half empty bottle of wine. I poured myself a glass and opened the pantry, half expecting a miracle.
   It held mostly cleaning supplies. There were two shelves that would normally contain food products, but of course there were none. 
   I opened my banking app, unable to recall the last time I went grocery shopping.

   CHECKING ACCOUNT BALANCE: $12.48

   Fuck.
   Deciding that was a problem for later, I crawled into bed to investigate the clothing company I’d be interviewing with.
   Founded in 2022 by Juliette Walker, named after herself, had a collection appear at last year’s Paris fashion week, and has a focus on couture street wear. 
   I hunted through my closet for something that would help me pass as someone they’d want there.
   A pair of black high waisted slacks, a white button up, a black knitted vest with white details around the collar and sleeves, a black leather belt and white loafers with gold buckles. I laid everything out on a chair, feeling as prepared as one could for their first job interview in years.
   In the foyer I found my cat sleeping on my sandals. 
   “Truffle, I need those,” I crouched down, petting his head. He let out a raspy meow in response and walked to his food bowl, requesting dinner. I served him and scratched behind his striped ears before throwing my purse over my shoulder and walking out the door.
   Where the little bird had been was now a freshly buried grave, illuminated by moonlight. Shadows of flowers bounced gently across it.
   The glow of street lamps highlighted perfectly manicured lawns and white picket fences as I walked.
   “Don’t touch me! What’s wrong with you?! I’m not going anywhere with you!” 
   A woman screamed at a man on the opposite side of the street.
   “C’mon, it’s a long way home, you can’t walk all that way by yourself!”
   He’d had too much to drink.
   “I’m not getting in your car. Leave me alone or I’m calling the cops!”
   Her pleas fell on deaf ears.
   “Get in the damn car!”
   He yanked on her arm. 
   I wondered why she didn’t pepper spray the freak and run.
   She freed herself and dialed 9-1-1 prompting the drunk to leave, tires screeching as she scurried in the other direction.
   More white picket fences and beautiful lawns.
   “We close in twenty minutes,” an older man called out from behind the register before I even made it through the door.
   I nodded and picked up the pace.
   White rice, a can of baked beans, a bag of broccoli, and a container of tofu.
   I placed my items on the counter, feeling guilty for inconveniencing the tired cashier.
   “Do you want a bag?”
   I contemplated the further inconvenience before denying his offer.
   “$11.49.”
   I placed my card in the reader and prayed.
   PAYMENT ACCEPTED
   A sigh of relief escaped my chest as I piled everything into my purse and hurried out the doors.
   There were skid marks in the road from earlier and I wondered if he’d left any marks on the girl, too, or if that was the only evidence of his behavior that evening.
   When I got home I put my purse down on the bench in the foyer and pulled out the rice, broccoli, and tofu and threw together dinner, ate, and went to bed.

   The ocean lulled me to sleep, where I dreamt I was standing in its waves. 
   The pitch dark surrounded me and the rushing water pulled me further in. The crashing waves got louder and louder. I was looking for something. Something between the curtain of black sky and the endless black sea. The ocean was angry. A wall of thick fog came barreling toward me and before I could turn and run it enveloped me completely. My search became frantic and out of the oppressing darkness came a scream, bloodcurdling and desperate.




The Interview

   I shot up from my pillow in a puddle of sweat. My jaw was sore from grinding my teeth and my head felt full.
   I reached over to check the time on my phone.
   5:55
   A realization hit me like a brick.
   How am I supposed to order a ride home?
   My bank account was close to negative.
   I opened my messages and clicked his contact hesitantly: Dad.
   I have a job interview today. Charlie is dropping me off, but I have no money to get home. Could you send me some? I just need enough for the drive back. Thanks.
   I hit send and within moments I was notified of a deposit.
   NEW BALANCE: $1,000.79
   Not a word in response. Anything to keep me from embarrassing him any further. And to keep from having to speak to me.
   I laid my head back down and stared at the ceiling following the grooves in the wood beams, sunlight moving through them and creating tiny shadows in the uneven patterns.
   My alarm signaled six o’clock.
   The scalding shower water washed the sweat from my hair and filled the small window at the top of the wall with fog. Between the house plants I’d set on the ledge, I could see the blue sky and my neighbors cypress trees. A seagull flew by, headed west toward the beach.
   I didn’t want to go to this interview.
   My phone rang and without looking I knew it was Charlie making sure I wasn’t bailing.
   “Are you up?”
   “Yes, I’m just getting out of the shower.”
   “Good, I’ll be there in thirty!”
   Her excitement made it worse.
   My blow dryer brought my hair to life and makeup hid my lack of sleep. The clothes I’d picked out the day before made me seem less like a drain on society and more like a person with potential.
   Charlie’s VW Beetle roared up the street. I threw my resume and phone in my purse and yelled a goodbye to Truffle across the house.
   The mound of soil behind the lilies caught my eye while I pressured the rusted deadbolt to lock behind me. Unease washed over me.
   “Hurry up, traffic’s getting worse!” Charlie called over the rumbling of the engine.
   As I got in, Charlie handed me an iced latte and white paper bag with a smile.
   “Breakfast, eat!”
   I’d never know what I’d done to deserve a friend as kind as her.
   The palm trees and tiny houses passed us by while Charlie told her latest tale of woe about the guy she’s been seeing.
   “He got completely wasted at the karaoke bar on Saturday. He went onstage and sang ‘Endless Love’ and started crying about how much he misses his ex-wife. Into the mic. In front of everyone. Dating in your thirties really is as bad as everyone makes it out to be.”
   “Where do you even find these guys? First the dude with like twelve weiner dogs and his entire home decor centered around them? Then the guy that claimed he was a big shot music producer and  turned out to be some schlub that lived in his mom’s basement!”
   Charlie burst out laughing and chimed in, “Then that dude that was fully catfishing!”
   “The one whose profile said he was thirty-two and was obviously in his late fifties!”
   “Or the one that – oh shit!” 
   Charlie slammed on the brake and slid to a stop.
   A deer stood about two feet from the hood of the car, staring at us. Charlie honked the horn, egging the doe on to move across the road, but she wouldn’t budge.
   “Can you get around it?” I asked, assessing the space between us and the traffic island to our left.
   Charlie slowly pushed forward around the backside of the deer, its attention locked on us.
   In the rear view mirror the deer sprung to life and bounded into the bushes on the right side of the road.
   Charlie and I shared a curious glance and for a moment I thought about telling her about the bird.

   Charlie’s GPS informed us we were only half a mile away so I took in the scenery of the surrounding area. Restaurants, boutiques, niche pâtisseries and coffee shops lined the streets, along with a promising looking bookstore.
   We arrived at a multistory office building, shimmering and reflective from top to bottom.
   “Very chic,” Charlie admired its shine.
   She slapped my knee, “Knock ‘em dead kid!”
   Inside, pure white LED lights wiggled around the ceiling hanging from nearly invisible wires. The white marble flooring with silver veins reflected the light giving a similar sensation to snow blindness. Modern art that seemed too colorful for its habitat lined the walls.
   The secretary at the huge, round desk seemed too young for how old she looked. I couldn’t decide if she was 23 or 53. She stared at me from across the lobby behind red rimmed coke bottle glasses.
   “Hi!” she prompted, grinning ear to ear, her shrill voice echoing throughout the room,”Can I help you?”
   “Good morning!” I mimicked her eagerness as I approached her desk. 
   Red lipstick smeared her teeth and her beehive hairstyle looked as though it hadn’t been undone in ages, as if actual bees were living inside of it and she’d dared not disturb them. She reeked of cigarettes.
   “I’m here for an interview, I have an appointment with Ms. Walker.”
   “Wonderful!” 
   Her voice was evidence of her smoking.
   She picked up the phone and waited.
   “Your eight AM is here! Yes ma’am I’ll send her back now.”
   The secretary hung up and peered at me, her  glassy blue eyes magnified behind her thick lenses. The nametag fastened to her blouse read “Flo” in white cursive letters.
   “She’s down that hall!”
   Flo pointed to an archway behind her with long acrylic nails that matched her crimson teeth. A smile spread across her lips again causing them to crack and reveal the pale pink skin beneath the crumbly lipstick.
   “Thanks Flo,” I murmured back.
   It was like looking at a train wreck, everything told me to stop staring but I couldn’t.
   “Oh and Natalie?” Flo’s voice lowered to a throaty whisper, “Call her Juliette. She can’t stand to be called Ms. Walker.”
   I nodded and tore myself away.
   The arch led to a long hallway. More LED strips snaked their way across the ceiling to a set of french doors. I was reminded of the many hospital trips to visit my mother when she was sick.
   Before I could reach out to knock, the doors swung open and revealed a vast office space.
   In the middle of the room over a white fur rug sat four leather chairs, also white, and a coffee table made entirely of glass in the center of them.
   A voice called from my left, “You must be Natalie.” There was a hint of an Eastern European accent.
   A tall, thin woman, presumably Juliette,  leaned against a desk.
   She peered through half rimmed glasses down at a tablet in her hands, scrolling with her index finger.
   “Yes, and you must be Juliette,” I tried not come off as eager as I had towards Flo, “It’s nice to meet you.”
   “Come sit.”
   Julliette glided across the room, her ridiculously tall high heels barely making a sound against the marble tile. Her all black attire created a stark contrast to our surroundings as she sat in one of the chairs at the center of the room.
   Her screen still held her attention as I joined her in silence.
   Assuming  she was looking over my resume I distracted myself, watching the sunlight pouring in from the floor-to-ceiling windows that spanned her office.
   After what felt like years Juliette finally spoke.
   “Why are you here?”
   “Oh… I’m here for the position of content writer.”
   “I know you are here for the job but why?”
   My heart sunk to my stomach. Her tablet must have been telling her of my past transgressions.
   “What inspired you to write for me?”
   Relief flooded me.
   “Oh yes of course, I misunderstood.” 
   I attempted to give her the ego boost she wanted, “Your work is pure art. Who wouldn’t want to be around to witness it?”
   Juliette stood, removing her glasses and placing the earpiece between her teeth, looking me up and down.
   “What does that painting represent to you?”
   Using her glasses, she gestured to a massive portrait hung behind her desk.
  In the painting a man leaned against a monolith wearing only a sash, his imposing stature dwarfing the nude woman he held in his arms. She reached for the heavens with one hand and pushed away from the man with the other. His arms wrapped around her, gripping her thigh and belly. His expression was both determined and sly. Hers was that of terror.
   “An imbalance of power.”
   My answer came out quieter than I’d meant, my attention still on the face of the woman who cried out within the frame.
   Julliette strode back to her desk and stood below the painting, staring up at it. Her short, pitch black hair swayed lightly as she tilted her head side to side.
   She wrapped her arms around her own waist, digging her thin fingers into her sides.
   The backless silk top Juliette wore accentuated her spine and shoulder blades, her skin clinging too tightly to her bones.
   She began swaying lightly and humming. The tune echoed through the room.
   Whatever was happening felt far too intimate for me to witness, but just as I couldn’t look away from the trainwreck in the lobby, I couldn’t help but watch this too.
   After far too long I cleared my throat.
   Juliette whipped around and without so much as looking at me she sat at her desk, tapped on her computer screen and announced, “You start Monday.”
   The doors to her office swung open again, beckoning me back into the memories of my mother.
   I waited a moment expecting more from her, but Juliette remained glued to her screen.
   My face wasn’t hiding my confusion as I thanked her and left.
   Flo was tapping away at her keyboard, filling the room with clicks when I returned to the lobby.
   She turned to me, beaming.
   “We are so excited to have you join us!” 
   Unsure of what to say I gave her a faint smile.
   Walking back into the world was like leaving the twilight zone. 
   I wandered the streets, intoxicated by the smells and sights, letting them guide my aimless path.
   Around noon I came across the bookstore I noticed on the drive in.
   The sign hanging above the door was made to look like an opened book with Twice Loved Tales  written on its pages in calligraphy.
   I paced the aisles and flipped through pages, looking for nothing in particular.
   A cat with long black fur slept on a chair tucked away into a corner. I crouched down to say hello and its purr filled the quiet space around me.
   “That’s Mia.”
   I whirled around to find a man standing there.
   “I’m sorry,” he let out a quiet laugh, “I didn’t mean to startle you.”
   I felt my face flush red.
   “No, you’re fine. I was just in my own world,” my tone didn’t mask my embarrassment. “Do you work here?”
   He looked around, “No, I just spend too much time here. Frankenstein?” he asked, nodding toward the book I held.
   “Oh, yeah. I’ve read it, I just don’t have my own copy.”
   “It’s always good to have the classics on hand. They teach us important lessons,” his smile was wide and beautiful and drew me in, “like who the real monsters are.”",1,1760382674.0,creepcast,0,0.67,False

I just noticed that I left a burner on the stove. Last time I cooked was around 8pm last night.  It's noon. 

I'm so grateful nothing went wrong. The burner was on low, nothing was on top of it, it's a glass/electric stove. 

And I know how I did it. I usually turn the burner off at a certain step when making this cheesy pasta dish. I didn't this time because I added some frozen peas and wanted the extra heat time. (Yay I added veggies! Boooo routine disruption!). Then I usually check the knobs before sitting down, but I didn't this time, I was concerned that the sauce was too thin and was checking the fridge for the left over broccoli I had.

I've never done this before. In the past I'd occasionally leave the oven on but notice when I would check the time. Then the habit to check the time before sitting down fixed that. But the stove top? Never! I slept all night with that on. I have been awake for 4 hours! I made coffee and set the microwave timer right above the stove. How did it take so long for me to notice? I only did because I was going to turn on the oven to make chicken for lunch (which I haven't done yet because I am just sitting in shock at myself).

I don't need advice, the routine works and this just reinforces it for me. But any similar stories or words of encouragement to help me not feel so negligent would be welcome! ",2,1760382441.0,adhdwomen,4,1.0,False

He feels I'm not supportive if I don't praise him but sometimes I just don't want to hear it. How do I handle this?","Hello all. So this is coming off of a huge fight we had last night. I guess I'll just give the play by play and see what you all think. This is a recurring issue and I'm at my wits end. Last night my husband was practicing guitar, he just got a new one after irresponsibly breaking his old guitar by leaving it leaning on the couch and accidentally knocking it into to coffee table. Cool, whatever I'm fine with it. 

The fight started because we were supposed to go get groceries. He said ""let's start that list"" and I said ""yeah go ahead and grab the notepad you know where it is"". He then said ""no you grab it"" which, I'll be honest did irritate me. I said again ""you can write the list this time, come on"" and he actually said ""get your ass over here and write the list"". So this already seems kinda bad but he did kinda laugh a bit as if he was joking? It rubbed me the wrong way though I'll be honest. Like the mental load thing that people talk about it seemed like he just didn't want to use his brain and wanted to use mine. 

I went to use the bathroom first and he grabbed his guitar again and started playing again. He does this at any time of the day. He only plays his acoustic guitar in spite of the fact that he has an electric that can be plugged in and used with headphones. Moving on. I came out of the bathroom, where I could only hear a very muffled version of whatever he was playing and honestly wasn't paying attention to it at all. He said ""how was that"" and I shrugged. Like an ""I dunno"" gesture because truly I wasn't listening. Yes I was a bit miffed about the demanding way he asked me to make the list, I'm sure he picked up some of that, but really I just didn't have any feedback. I sat down with the notepad to make the list, and he resumes playing his guitar. I got a couple things on the list and then said after a few minutes ""are we making this list or what?' because I expect him to add what he wants to the list and he was just jamming away. 

He. Lost. It. He went off about how I'm super unsupportive and that I should have complimented him instead of shrugging because he thought that it sounded really good. I have been with him for ten years. I have listened to him play at all hours of the day and complimented him millions of times. I've been subjected to his playing at any and all times of the day in our tiny apartment with nowhere for me to have any peace. I supported him buying another expensive guitar when he is the one who didn't take care of his other instruments. I told him that I have listened to him play to the point where I tune it out sometimes and I have a right to do so because he can't just expect applause every time he grabs his guitar it's too often and too much of an intrusion to me to expect that I'm just gonna be thrilled at all times that he's playing. He didn't ask me to listen and give feedback, I thought he was just jamming, and he didn't even ask if I even wanted to hear guitar at that moment, just blasted it into my eardrums as always without consideration to me. 

He said if I don't like it go into the other room. Forget the fact that we're supposed to be making a grocery list and were about to run errands, but the last time I left the room when he started playing he followed me into the other room and said ""that was fucking rude'. Because I didn't want to hear him play. he just decided that I had to sit there and listen to him and that I'M rude if I don't want to hear it at that moment. Like sure he's good but I like peace and quiet sometimes. 

To be honest I think it is incredibly rude and even kind of narcissistic on his part. He will play at one in the morning and get pissed if I ask him to not do that because it's late. Even in the other room I can hear it very loudly because it's a small apartment.  If he starts playing, at his whim, at whatever time, and I ask him to not do that right now he has a tantrum about how unsupportive I am. It's driving me insane, and I need someone to tell me if this is truly unsupportive or if he really is just being an asshole.

 I can't just allot certain hours of the day because his schedule for work is all over the place. In the middle of our huge fight he said that none of his previous girlfriends ever complained about it and I just don't see how that's possible. I told him he'd have a really hard time finding another grown woman in her thirties that just wouldn't mind being interrupted at any random time of the day numerous times in the day with loud acoustic guitar without being asked first if it's alright for him to jam. Also, if I were to say please not right now, the option to use the electric guitar and wear headphones is still there. I feel like subjecting me to it is some kind of power play at this point.

Then later on in the night we had sex, I was happy in the moment and then after I got a little upset and sad because I thought of how he something’s thinks of other things or people when we have sex. I tried to mask and just let myself have the moment and move on. But he noticed and asked so I began to calmly explain how I was feeling and he immediately started flipping out. Cursing at me telling me I make a problem out of everything and that he’s not going to deal with this for the rest of his life(mind you he has not taken care of his porn addiction it is actually thriving kind of) I said I just had a moment that’s all im allowed to have those and he proceeded to basically insult me and degrade me and my feelings. And then I’m sitting here questioning “is this an abusive relationships, am I the problem, what can I do better”. We did have one joint therapy session with his therapist and she think we should do counseling I agreed and he agreed as well in the session. But then after on the way home he said he was 50/50 idk. I feel like I’m going crazy because he then tells me I’m being the problem by bringing his addiction up and not letting things be.",3,1760381932.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

I’ve had stitches when I was younger, and I still remember how careful I had to be while they healed. The experience taught me a lot about following instructions and being patient during recovery. Daren got some time off from work after the mustache fiasco, Mary didn’t believe the story I told the cops about a “shelf” falling on Daren. 

Mary told me she tried to check the security footage of the store, but conveniently the security cameras glitched out so there was no recording of what really happened. That only made the whole situation even more suspicious, especially since Mary is rarely convinced by my explanations—when it comes to weird things at night. I, of course, was relieved that there is no proof to disprove my claims to the cops. 

Turns out, Daren ended up with twelve stitches on his forehead, a concussion, and a dislocated shoulder. I’m surprised, that man wasn’t hurt even worse, well given he is just a twig. He won’t be returning to work for a few days probably and probably won’t intervene with the paranormal or mustache’s anytime soon. 

While speaking with Mary in her office, she included Daren on speakerphone to discuss our accounts. Daren stated that he had temporary memory loss as a result of his concussion, although I know he remembers the whole incident. 

So, I guess I’ve still got a coworker working with me on the overnight shift, he’s just taking a mini medical vacation at the moment. 

So, while he’s out, I get to go back to be alone again and figure out what I’m going to do with the mustache in the jar. 

Honestly, I don’t know what to do with it, although it is entertaining when I shake the jar, and the sentient facial hair, quivers and twirls and slams against the glass jar wall. Have you ever trapped a bug in a jar and had the urge to shake it? That’s how this feels, like I’m holding onto something a little wild and unpredictable, not quite sure what will happen if I poke at it too much. The mustache sits there, sealed in its glass prison, and it’s almost tempting to see if prodding it will cause some reaction, even though I know better than to actually try.

Working on the overnight shift, you learn a few things NOT to do, like Daren for example, don’t intervene in the paranormal. You get twelve stitches, a concussion and a dislocated shoulder. Of course, I was going to rub it in his face when he comes back, despite Daren’s can-do attitude, I actually like the guy. He’s not half bad for being inexperienced with the paranormal. 

It sucked I had to come in so early before my shift to talk to Mary about the incident, during the day, the gas station really does look like a forgotten relic on the edge of nowhere, but when the sun goes down. Its flickering sign casting epileptic shadows across the cracked asphalt, the numbers on the sign of gas prices flickers like a warning sign. As I got off my bus and walked towards the parking lot sipping lukewarm coffee and muttering curses at the moths dive-bombing me. 

The moment I opened the door and stepped inside of the gas station, the smell of it clings on to you like a parasite, I’ve washed my clothes so many times, no amount of showers gets rid of that smell. Like scorched popcorn and existential dread. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead like the angry hornets’ nest that hangs above pump eight like a red flag. Coming back was a pain in the ass from early this afternoon; I clocked in at 9:59 PM— one minute early. Usually, I’m ten minutes late. 

I relieved Scott, who was practically already running out the door, without a goodbye, apparently, he’s got some gaming session to play with his friends. Knowing him, it’s probably in the basement of his mom’s house. No one has discovered the Mustache yet, I kept him hidden in one of the junk drawers no one looks in, if Mary noticed the tip jar missing, she didn’t comment about it. 

I started my usual routine, noticing Tommi didn’t come in to be a nuisance, he did text me and say that there was a festival tonight and he’d be far too busy to grace me with his presence, I didn’t mind. I checked the cooler for expired milk—the freezer ghost adamantly was slamming against the door. Restocked the gum rack—found a green glowing German roach. And wiped down the counter with a rag that smelled suspiciously like gasoline. I had one earbud in my ear; my playlist was something all alternative people could appreciate. 

About 2:17 AM, The bell sounded across the store,  I was in the middle of trying to make the slushie machine work, it’s usually the cherry that stops working and oozes out from the top. A man entered, not anyone I’d seen before, he wore a coat that looked like it had been stitched together by different fabrics. He didn’t speak. He didn’t blink. He carried an old, weaved picnic basket in one arm. 

There was something unsettling about the way he moved—deliberate, without a hint of hesitation, as if he’d rehearsed every step before even entering the store. I paused, trying to gauge if he was just another lost drifter that came down from the mountain or if he belonged to the category of oddities that seemed drawn to this place after midnight. 

The hum of the fluorescent lights suddenly felt louder, and for a moment, even the mustache in the jar seemed to sense something was off, twitching against the glass as if in warning (I kept the mustache on the counter during my shift). 

I watched him walk up the aisles as if he was looking for something. The way he moved and turned his entire body when he wanted to look at something didn’t feel right. 

I set the slushie cup down, wiping my hands on my jeans, my eyes fixed on the stranger as he made his way past the aisles with barely a glance at the merchandise. Every step echoed on the chipped linoleum, each movement sending a jolt of unease up my spine. The mustache rattled its jar again, almost frantic now, and I resisted the urge to slide it out of sight. somehow, I had the feeling that nothing in this store could really be hidden once you enter.

The knocking in the freezer stopped, the ticking of the clock on the wall did too, everything felt still. Like the store was holding its breath. I walked over the cash wrap and walked behind the counter and stood at the register, watching the man silently. 

He finally approached the counter and set the weaved old picnic basket down with an unnerving gentleness, its surface frayed and faded with age. The handle creaked as he released it, and for a moment, he simply stood there, staring straight ahead while the basket seemed almost out of place against the battered counter. I swallowed; my hand unconsciously tightened around the rag, waiting for him to say or do something or anything to break the silence that pressed down like a heavy blanket.

So, I broke the silence, “hi, did you find everything you were looking for?” trying my inner Daren customer service voice. 

“Matches.” That was all he grunted out, his voice rough and gravelly, as if the single word cost him more effort than it should have. I blinked, trying to read his expression, but his eyes remained fixed somewhere behind me, unfocused and distant.

Normal gas stations don’t have matches, but Mary was old school and carried them. So, I pulled out a pack for him and rang him up. “That’s going to be $3.08, I also need to see your I.D. before you pay this, it’s the rules and all.” 

He slid the card across the counter, his movements slow and deliberate, never breaking eye contact with some invisible spot over my shoulder. I glanced at the name, trying not to let my expression betray any hint of recognition or concern. It was a woman’s I.D. and I quickly realized I’d better pretend this was his. The air felt charged, like a storm looming just outside the flickering glass doors.

“Will that be cash or card, sir?”

He held up a plastic card, with blood on it, and a woman's name glinted in the fluorescent lighting. I don't get paid enough to ask. I kept my face neutral, swiped the card, and tried not to dwell on the metallic tang that lingered in the air. The register beeped, and for a moment, I wondered if it would refuse the transaction on principle, but it spat out a receipt as if nothing at all was amiss.

He reached for the matches and left the store. He left the weaved picnic basket on my counter, its faded pattern suddenly looking more sinister beneath the harsh fluorescent lights. I tried to yell after him that he’d forgotten his basket, my voice echoing through the silent aisles, but he was gone, just vanished into the night, leaving only the lingering chill in the air and the strange, uneasy quiet that seemed to press closer with every second.

I’m not touching that basket, so I grabbed a pen to push it to the side and something inside shifted. A faint, muffled clink echoed from within, like glass tapping against metal, and I froze, the pen poised midair. 

For a heartbeat, I was certain the basket itself was breathing, its weave tightening and loosening with some hidden pulse, until the sensation passed, leaving only my own rapid heartbeat drumming in my ears.

“Nope,” I said dropping the pen. I looked over at the mustache in the jar, “I was stupid enough to tango with you, not going to mess with a haunted hamper.” 

I grabbed the Windex and sprayed it with good measure, the basket stopped breathing, I’d learned that for some reason most supernatural things in this store are repelled by Windex, or at least this kind. But I have a working theory the Windex Mary buys isn’t actually Windex. 

It smells sharper, more like ozone and lavender than actual glass cleaner, and it leaves behind a faint shimmer on anything it touches. I’ve stopped questioning it. I just keep extra bottles beneath the counter, replenishing my stash whenever Mary restocks. Some nights, when the store feels especially restless, I spritz a little into the corners and watch the shadows recoil, huddling away from the gleam.

When I was sure nothing was going to pop out of the basket like a jack-in-the-box, I went back to working on unclogging the slushie machine. My hands shook just a little as I pulled out the sticky tray, half expecting to find something lurking beneath the grape syrup. It was quiet, almost too quiet. except for the hum of the cooler and the occasional drip from the busted ceiling tile.

I turned around with the tray and nearly dropped it when I saw the weaved basket on the table behind me. I could have sworn I'd pushed it far out of sight, yet there it sat, somehow closer than before, its faded colors looking even more warped under the harsh overhead lights. For a moment, I just stared, unsure whether to run or grab the Windex again.

“This is how the blondes die in horror movies, there is no way I’m going to open that thing,” I said more to myself than anything. 

But the basket just sat there, indifferent to my refusal, its shadow stretching out across the linoleum like a warning. I edged around it, keeping one wary eye on the weave as I dumped the slushie tray in the sink. Behind me, the basket gave another faint clink, almost as if something inside had shifted again or was trying to get out. I shivered and glanced at the clock, silently willing the next customer to walk in and break the tension.

When I turned back around to replace the tray at the slushie machine this time, I tripped over the weaved basket. It scraped across the linoleum with a hollow thud, sending a jolt of panic up my spine as my foot tangled in its faded handle. As I stumbled forward, instantly, I was somewhere else. 

I was no longer in the gas station but at a familiar park I used to go to when I was a kid. The air felt warmer here, thick with the scent of cut grass and sun-warmed earth, and the distant laughter of children echoed from across a playground I remembered like a dream. I was surrounded by towering oaks and the faded green of the old swing set, as if the years had folded in on themselves and brought me back to a moment, I thought I’d left behind.

“Mommy!” I heard the faint cry of a young girl from afar; excitement was laced in her tone. I walked around one of the oak trees, to see a mother and daughter having a picnic, with that same old weaved picnic basket that was in the gas station. 

The memory hit me hard, I remember this, it was my sixth birthday, and the park seemed bigger back then, every corner bursting with possibility. My mom set up a picnic beneath the oaks, balloons bobbing in the gentle breeze, and I wore a paper crown that kept slipping sideways on my head. I could almost taste the sweetness of melted ice cream and hear the crinkling of wrapping paper as I tore into my presents, it was just the two of us.

But the sky was wrong, the sun flickered like a dying bulb and my mom’s face was blurred, as though I was peering at her through warped glass. The colors around me seemed slightly off, too vivid at the edges and strangely washed out everywhere else, making everything feel both familiar and unsettling at the same time. I tried to focus, to latch onto a detail that felt real, but the scene wavered with each breath, as if I were standing in the middle of a memory that didn’t entirely belong to me.

I shook my head and glanced around, *this* wasn’t how it happened. My memories felt slightly jumbled, but I distinctively remembered that my mom gave me presents, she got up telling me she was going to go to the bathroom but never came back. 

When I turned back toward the picnic, my six-year-old self was standing all alone, gazing at me with an intensity that sent a chill through me. There was something unsettling in her stare like something darker lurking behind those wide eyes, a shadow of malice that hadn’t been there in my memories. The paper crown wobbled on her brow, but her lips curled into a strange, knowing smirk that made the sun seem to flicker even more violently overhead.

“ARLEN!” 

Tommi’s voice pulled me out of the weird dream, jolting me back to the harsh glare of the gas station’s fluorescent lights. I blinked, disoriented, realizing I was sitting on the cold linoleum floor with Tommi crouching beside me, his brows knit in worry as he asked if I was okay. The sounds of the station, the hum of the fridge, the distant ring of the cash register, slowly filtered back in, grounding me in the present as I tried to make sense of what had just happened.

“Are you okay?” he asked softly. 

I swallowed, the taste of memory lingering thick at the back of my throat. For a moment, I couldn’t find my voice, haunted by the vividness of a place that was gone yet somehow still part of me. I nodded slowly and tried to steady my breathing, the echo of that strange vision still reverberating in my head. “Yeah,” I managed finally, my voice shaky but determined. “I just got a little lightheaded, I guess. Must’ve tripped.”

He helped me on my feet to a chair; he grabbed one of the plastic cups and filled the fountain plastic cup with water and held it out to me. “Are you sure you’re, okay?”

I took the cup, my hands trembling slightly as I sipped the cold water. It felt almost unreal, how a simple taste grounded me, pulling me back from the edges of that disjointed memory. Tommi watched me, concern etched deep in his face, and I forced a small, reassuring smile. “I’m really okay. It just… all hit me at once.” Even as I spoke, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something from that memory was lingering, just out of sight, waiting for another chance to surface.

I don’t know exactly what happened, it was like I was transported through time, but in a different distorted place, it felt more like a messed-up nightmare than anything else. I gingerly sipped the water as I flicked my eyes back up at him, his brows furrowed and his sharp intelligent eyes stared down at me with concern. 

I tried to laugh it off, “it’s nothing, nothing happened, maybe it’s because I haven’t eaten anything at all.” I took another ginger sip. “I thought you were busy with the festival at your tattoo shop.” 

Tommi shrugged, still looking uneasy. “Yeah, I was, it ended hours ago. You didn’t answer your phone.” His voice was gentle, but there was an edge underneath, like he was second-guessing whether to push further. “You know you can tell me if something’s wrong, right?” He leaned forward a bit, resting his palm on the table. 

I blinked, “hours ago?” I was baffled. I pulled my phone out of my pocket to see my shift was going to end in an hour. “It didn’t feel like it was that long . . .” I muttered to myself. 

My mind raced, grasping for a sensible explanation as I stared at the flickering phone screen, its blue light feeling almost foreign in my hand. The minutes felt stretched and bent, as if the world had skipped ahead without me. 

I looked up at Tommi, swallowed again, and tried to shake off the lingering haze. “Honestly, it just feels like I blinked and missed a chunk of time,” I admitted, the words sounding strange even to myself. The faint hum of anxiety buzzed beneath my skin, urging me to stay alert, to search for clues in the ordinary.

“Time is actually irrelevant, but here it matters I suppose,” his voice sounded far, as if he instantly was across the store. When I looked up from my cup, he was gone. I was alone in the gas station again. 

“Tommi?”

My breath caught in my chest. The sudden emptiness pressed in, thick and strange, and for a heartbeat I wondered if he'd ever really been there at all. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, their hum growing louder in the silence, making the whole world feel artificial, as if I’d slipped out of reality and into some hollow echo of it.

I stood up quickly and set the cup on the table and walked around the cash wrap to find the weaved basket still where I’d left it. Untouched, withered, unmoving, I glanced at where the mustache in the jar I left, but it wasn’t there. Slowly looking out the front windows, it was inky blackness outside, no lights, no pumps, no sweeper. It was like the gas station was swallowed by a blackhole. 

My heart pounded as I stepped closer to the windows, straining to see any hint of life beyond the glass. Even the familiar neon sign above the door seemed to have vanished, swallowed by the dense, suffocating dark. 

For a moment, I wondered if I was dreaming, locked in some strange liminal space between memory and reality, where every ordinary detail turned uncanny. I hesitated, the silence pressing in on me, unsure whether to call out again or just listen for any sign that I wasn't truly alone.

“Arlen, wake up!” Tommi’s voice filled my ears, and I gasped awake, heart still hammering in my chest. The fluorescent lights snapped sharply back into focus, as I looked up from my head, laying in the crook of my elbow, hunched over the table as if I had fallen asleep. “You must have fallen asleep while working last night.” 

I glanced up at Tommi and squinted my eyes up at him, “are you real?” 

He gave a short, almost sheepish laugh. “Last time I checked, I was pretty real.” The way his eyes searched my face made it clear he was trying to read my mood, to reassure me, or maybe himself, that everything was normal again. 

The world felt shaky under me, reality stitched together by thin threads. For a moment, I just listened to the familiar hum of the lights and the distant whir of the cooler, grounding myself in the small, ordinary sounds.

“You couldn’t come in because you were too busy at your shop,” the words felt hollow in my throat, a repeated conversation I had with him. 

He leaned in closer, his tone sharper and more urgent than before. “I told you time is irrelevant here, but seriously, wake up or you might not ever. Just open your palm, you’ll see I’m right.” His words hung in the air, heavy with warning and a strange certainty, making me hesitate before glancing down at my hand.

I didn’t see anything in my hand at first, just the faded lines of my palmbut I did as he said. I opened it anyway. In an instant, the world shifted around me, and suddenly I was standing behind the register, the pen slipping from my grasp and clattering onto the counter as I realized I’d just used it to push the basket away. 

For a split second, everything felt both familiar and impossibly strange, as if the mundane act of dropping the pen had snapped me back into reality, I wasn’t sure was truly mine.

I glanced out the window, there the floodlights at the pumps flickered normally, Sweeper was sweeping around pump four as if it was a regular Sunday. I choked, a breathless laugh escaping me as the tension in my chest eased, just a little. It was all back again—the harsh glare of the lights, the hum of the refrigerator, the ordinary sounds that proved I hadn't drifted too far from the world I knew. 

There was honestly something about that basket, I opened and closed my hand. When the door dinged, I looked up to see Tommi walking through the door in his usual leather jacket, and smudged ink on his jaw and neck and hands. “Please tell me this is real. I’m not dreaming right now, right?” my eyes weld up with tears. 

He seemed confused and nodded, rubbing the back of his neck. “I’m just stopping in to grab some energy drinks before I have to deal with all the drunk people from the festival downtown,” he said, his voice carrying the tired resignation of someone already bracing for a long night. The familiar way he spoke-half exasperated, half amused—helped steady me, anchoring the moment in something real and ordinary.

“Oh, thank god, I’m back.” I said relieved. 

He laughed, shaking his head. “If you weren’t working, Arlen, where else would you be, at some secret beach getaway? Or maybe finally catching up on sleep?” His sarcasm cut through the haze, bringing a hint of normalcy back to the conversation. He walked towards the cooler doors towards the energy drinks. 

I glared at the basket, “I wish, I dozed off and had a bizarre dream and kept waking up in the gas station and you kept waking me up.” 

He had a strange smile, one that twisted at the corner of his mouth as he grabbed several cans from the shelf. “That sounds like one hell of a bizarre dream,” he replied, eyebrows raised with genuine curiosity. “What happened in it? Did I actually manage to wake you up, or was I just a figment?”

I paused, honestly, I didn’t know. “Well, I’m awake,” I said softly, it was almost a prayer, I hoped I was awake this time. because if the basket was messing with me again, I swear I was going to light it on fire. “You kept saying time was irrelevant.” 

He slowly walked up the aisle with cans of energy drinks, tossing them lightly from hand to hand. “Depends where and who you talk to,” he said, his voice echoing in the quiet of the store. He looked at me with a crooked grin, then added, “Some people swear time’s a loop, others think it’s just a line we’re all stuck on. Guess it’s all about perspective.” The way he said it made the ordinary person feel mysterious again, and for a moment, I found myself listening to that strange shift in reality, just in case.

I nodded, “what do you think?” 

He walked up to the counter and sat the energy drink cans down on the counter and glanced at the weaved picnic basket. He hesitated, weighing the question as if it deserved more than a casual answer. 

“I don’t know,” he admitted after a moment. “Sometimes it feels like everything repeats, like we’re stuck on the same track. Other times, it’s like things only move forward, leaving us scrambling to keep up.” He shrugged, the movement almost apologetic, and looked away, thoughtful. “Maybe it’s both. Maybe time bends around us without us noticing.”

I started scanning the barcodes on the energy drinks, “you sound like an old man, is that what you really think, Mr. Philosopher?” 

He shrugged, grinning a little. “Hey, someone’s got to balance out all those energy drinks with some wisdom, right?” The lightness in his voice didn’t quite mask the seriousness beneath, and for a heartbeat, I wondered if he was actually onto something. “Maybe we just notice time more when it gets weird,” he continued, his gaze flicking from the basket to me, “like moments that don’t fit, or dreams that bleed into real life.” It was a thought that lingered, unsettling and oddly comforting at the same time.

“I suppose so,” I said softly. “Cash or card?” 

He slid a crumpled bill from his pocket, handing it to me with a thoughtful look. “Cash today. Figure I’ll keep it simple.” He waited for me to give his change, still glancing at the basket as if it might start moving on its own. “You know sometimes I think we’re all just trying to find the edge of the dream. Maybe real life is just the part where we remember to pay for the energy drinks.” He gave a small laugh, then paused, watching me for a reaction. “Or maybe we’re still dreaming, and this is just another layer. Either way, I’m glad you’re awake for now.”

I handed him his change, and he reached out and curled his fingers into a fist and knocked on top of the basket lid. “What are you doing?!” I panicked from my earlier experience. 

But nothing happened. He just shrugged, unfazed, and continued talking as if my outburst hadn't startled him at all. “Relax,” he said, voice low and easy, “sometimes you just have to knock to see if the dream bites back. Usually, it doesn't.” He gave me a reassuring grin, then leaned casually against the counter, waiting for my nerves to settle.

“That doesn’t make sense, why knock?” I asked wondering what happened to me was just in my head. 

He tilted his head, considering. “Maybe it’s just habit, or superstition. You know, like knocking on wood for luck, or maybe it’s a way to check if something’s really there, if anything responds. It doesn’t have to make sense. Sometimes rituals are just how we keep ourselves anchored, even if we don’t remember why we started them.” He watched my face, a hint of amusement flickering in his eyes, and then added quietly, “Sometimes, asking why part is of waking up, too.”

He gathered his energy drinks and left telling me to have a good night. His words echoed in my mind, mingling with the half-remembered fragments of morning dreams and the faint hum. There was something oddly comforting in the way he spoke about rituals, as if every small gesture like knocking on basket lids, paying with cash had held its own secret logic, a thread tying us to reality even when it seemed thin. I found myself nodding, unsure if I agreed or simply wanted to believe in the sense behind it all.

I reached out and knocked on the lid of the basket. 

The clanking sound came back, and the basket moved, just a little, enough to make me freeze and stare. My breath caught as I watched it shift, the faint echo of metal on metal reminding me that maybe dreams did bite back after all. Suddenly, I wasn't sure which layer I was in, and the fluorescent lights seemed to hum a little louder.

Heart pounding, I hesitated, half expecting the basket to leap or whisper some secret only dreams could carry. But after that brief, uncanny movement, everything went still. The quiet stretched, charged with possibility, and I found myself listening for any sign that reality had shifted and wondering if I had crossed some invisible threshold, or if the world was simply holding its breath with me.

Then I heard the familiar knocking from the freezer door, and jolted, shouting, “Enough already, freezer ghost!” My voice echoed back at me, rattling alongside the knock, making the moment feel both ridiculous and real. For a second, I half-expected an answer from behind the frosted glass, but the store just settled into its usual silence, the only reply the low, steady hum of the coolers. 

I suppose I’m back in reality now, well I hope so. . . . . ",3,1760381828.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False
1o5sphr,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1o5sphr/are_my_friends_leaving_me_out_or_am_i_leaving/,Are my friends leaving me out or am I leaving myself out?,"Hi,
This is my first ever post so bear with me if the whole thing doesn’t make any sense by the end (Also I am not a native speaker, so they are gonna be some grammatical errors:/ ).
So I (F17) am in this friend group of four( all three are F16). One of them, I’m going to call her Mara, I’ve known her since elementary school but after we graduated we lost all contact. After some time passed I had to repeat eighth grade, so after the summer break I was in a new class were I didn’t know anyone. In that class were the other two girls, Jessica and Nora. They are best friends and kept to themselves. I’ve tried to build some kind of friendship with them in the eighth grade but I didn’t really work out. So eighth and ninth grade I didn’t really talk to them only if I needed to, because of school related things. In tenth grade is were it all changed. Mara and a new girl Savannah joined our class. Mara and Savannah immediately clicked and became really good friends. And because Mara had a cousin at our school she obviously spent time with her, but that cousin was friends with Jessica and Nora. So Mara, Savannah, Jessica and Nora became a group of four and really good friends at that. Our school year starts in September so mid to late October I started being friendly with all of them because of Savannah. Savannah said she had a sort of friend crush on me and was really happy that we had so much in common and through her I got close to all of them. In December we all went out to eat and exchanged social and had a great time and all. Till April everything was good they talked to me; I really had a great time with them but I was never really in there, if you get what I mean? I still had my two friends whom I usually hang out with at school. In April we had a class trip to Berlin. All four of them went but me( the reason here is not important). At that trip Savannah did some fucked up stuff and they all ,Nora, Jessica and Mara, stopped being friends with Savannah. And while they were on that trip they called me and told me all about it. After they came back the three of them were closer then ever and told me all about the things that happened, while Savannah was all alone in that class and kept to herself. At the beginning of this new order were I was in the place of Savannah everything was grade we were talking, going out telling each other things that happened and so on. But after a month or so I started to feel excluded. They still hung out with me and talked to me. But they started making plans in front of me, without me, going out without me, getting to know new people without me. And that tbh bothered me. So I talked about it with Mara, because we lived close by and hung out the most with her. I asked her if they even liked, why they were excluding me, if I did something wrong. But she reassured me that they liked me and wanted to be friends with me but that I didn’t talk a lot and „ ruin the atmosphere” because of it. So I change, I started talking more and they told me that it got better but the situation still didn’t change. So I talked to Mara multiple times about that, which I know was probably annoying her but I still wanted to feel like I wasn’t a after thought. She always reassured me that everything was ok but I still felt excluded all the time. During the summer break none of us saw each other but I talk to Nora a bit. After the summer break tho, they were all kind of change? I feel like they are at their all time high of excluding me. So I am fed up and I started to not talk to them I guess? I didn’t start conversations, so there weren’t any. They talk about things in their separate group chat were I’m not in about everything and everyone and then talk about those things in school so I have no idea what they are even talking about. I have a feeling tho that Nora ist the one that talks/ likes me that most out of them because while Jessica was away she always included me in their conversations and talked to me about all the things that they were talking about. So I want to ask her if we could meet up for a coffee and talk about that and how I feel for the very last time because I know I’ve been annoying but I still want to not feel this way anymore.
Sorry that the story is so long but I tried to include all the details that may play a role in this whole situation and wanted to get an outside perspective on the whole thing.
Should I just relax and not think so much about it which I find very hard to or are we just not compatible as friends?

1o5spa2,https://www.reddit.com/r/EmilieKiserUpdates/comments/1o5spa2/therapeutic_my_ass/,Therapeutic my ass…,"****I had time today so is super long,I have a lot of thoughts about this and don’t want to make multiple posts…read if you have time ******

She came back and was prerecording videos 2 months after the incident supposedly it’s “therapeutic “ 
But if it’s therapeutic why does she have to post them online? Why does she need to have it out in the social media world? If it’s therapeutic isn’t just for her? 
She posts them because she needs validation and praise like a narcissist. 
She need strangers giving her attention.
Something that is therapeutic doesn’t need to be public.

In my early 20s I used to record makeup videos because it was therapeutic. But because it was just that I didn’t sit there , edit the life of it and post it online . Because I wasn’t doing it for attention I was doing it because it was therapeutic and nice to see the process of doing the make up.

This is how I know all this therapeutic talk is bs.

This “whole” community she talks about that she missed and is so happy to be part of  is the same one she threw under the bus for being invasive to her private family tragedy. Even when it’s her who invited half the world into her house through her phone.
She can’t stay away because she found something easy that gives her money not because it’s therapeutic. She likes the attention, she is a pick me girl, she likes people stroking her ego telling her how amazing and how strong she is. 
She has no education prior to this no career and now can’t even go out to try to be a “normal” citizen with a regular job because she has put her life out there, people know who she is and what she has done and she has grown accustomed to life of consumerism she lives. 
I would have more respect if she was honest about it. And not lie omggg it’s so therapeutic I love this community bullshit. 

As far influencers goes , she is not someone that should or have influence on the GP. What is she influencing people to do? Be idiots do nothing all day but go shopping and yap like a Moron online about nothing? Buy more unnecessary crap from Amazon.? 
She has no career , no interesting hobbies or life. what are people really interested in her? At the moment watching how much of a freak she is for returning to make dumb videos like nothing after she caused the death of her child. 
Other than that? Nothing.
Just typical rich young white girl behavior. 
Wake up get ready get coffee, go to Trader Joe’s , go shopping go do some errands and be back home do a Sunday reset . That’s it. 
What’s so exciting about that? What do we gain watching her videos ? Nothing.
We can’t even call her content creator because she doesn’t create any type of content. It’s just vlogs. 
Daily life vlogs. 
These  are the type of “influencers” that don’t make sense to me . They’re just making little daily videos of their life. And people watch them . Nothing more.
It’s not brain surgery it’s not teaching you a skill is not showing you art it’s literally just watching a stranger do nothing in their day. Making videos for their imaginary “friends” recording “genuine “ reactions that probably took 3-8 tries and is overly edited. 

I follow a lot mom influencers that their life is actually interesting, like what is living off grid or having 10 kids, sahm of disabled kids . Something that is different something that I don’t know about but the videos she records I know it’s what most young sahm with a comfortable life style do. So I have zero interest in watching . Her content is not exciting is not new is not different from all the dull young moms doing the same repetitive routine and recording it. I could never watch a single of her video and could tell you what she records because it’s so bland and repetitive like 80%of all of these mom influencers that used their kids as props and is how they got popular. 

Her stan is just fueling her delusion. 
She didn’t use her popularity or money to create anything only buy stuff and fill it with more stuff. 
Her husband didn’t crate a business or grew the business he had. 
They did nothing with the opportunity they got but buy stuff . 

Idk to me for her to have a following just for doing nothing seems so stupid. 
Even her bff Awhole you could say her life was interesting when she started cause it was a nurse doing content and we got to see what’s like to be a picu nurse . But now ? Idk nothing interesting there either.

We need to reevaluate us as a society we are 
Giving too many vapid people a platform where they don’t contribute nothing to society but their narcissistic behavior and consumerism. 

Anyways my 2cents after seeing her very aggressive  and defensive response to the very valid comments on her videos about how weird it is for her to be back like nothing after her child died and it was her and her husband’s fault. 

PS. For her little minions in this thread 

I don’t have these thoughts because I’m jealous of her or “hate” her or have nothing better or is not smart enough like her little minions say. 
I have these thoughts as an angry parent that cannot process the level of stupidity we live in where we give people a pass and not pay for their actions when a child life was lost.  That their skin color and money helped them not be held responsible for a crime they committed. 
I think everyone would have backed off from them and given them a second chance if they had been held accountable. But because they were giving a pass like we all knew because of their status and race is why this will never pass. It will always be the big fat elephant in every room they step in.
She can’t take all the time she needs to try to not talk about it so people can forget her fault in it but the truth is the truth.

Hi there! 🤗

I hope you’re having a cozy, calm, or at least slightly sweet kind of day. I’m reaching out with an open heart, looking for a cuddle buddy and maybe a new friend here in the Netherlands — ideally near Amsterdam, but anywhere not too far works too!

A little about me:

• I'm 35 years old guy working as an executive and happily calling Amsterdam home for over 3 years now.
• I live alone, take care of myself, and try to stay fit — but also never say no to dessert.
• I’d be happy to host or come to you — whatever makes you feel safe and comfortable.
• I love being outside, especially in the summer — picnics, strolls, a lazy lunch on a sunny terrace… simple things, really.
• Traveling is a big part of my life and dreams — I’d love to see the whole world, one new place (and snack) at a time.
• I’m a good listener — friends often say I make them feel calm and heard. You’ll get lots of warm, respectful hugs and cozy company if that’s what you need 🤗
• Cleanliness and kindness go hand in hand for me — I value both deeply.
• I'm 183 cm tall, 80 kg, have broad shoulders, little muscular, tanned skin, black hair, brown eyes.

What I’m looking for:

Someone to share gentle, genuine connection with — whether that’s cuddling up on the couch, sharing a quiet moment over coffee, or just chatting about our days.

I’m also open to making new friends — movie nights, cooking together, mini-adventures nearby… whatever brings joy without pressure.

And of course, if you’d prefer to meet in a public space first, that’s absolutely fine — your comfort always comes first.

So if you’re someone who values kindness, closeness, and maybe the occasional silly laugh — I’d really love to hear from you. 💛

Let’s make a little space in this busy world for warmth and connection.

1o5sopz,https://www.reddit.com/r/foodtrucks/comments/1o5sopz/looking_to_lease_out_my_food_trailer_this_winter/,Looking to Lease out my Food Trailer this winter,"Hi all, I started a food truck this summer in Bozeman, Montana. It is an 18 foot-long airstream trailer. I sell soft pretzels out of it. For this, the main amenity in it is an oven. It has all required amenities for health inspection, as I was able to fully permit it. As of now, it is all electric, so I am wondering if there are any people or businesses looking to use it for something like a coffee/wafflle/crepe trailer/mobile bar. It would not work for someone looking to fry or do full-on huge meals. More so, it would be great for a catering company looking to serve premade food out of a sleak, well lit, beautiful trailer. It can come equipped with kegerators if someone does want to go the mobile bar route. I've never rented it out before, so just wanted to put feelers out there. It would be available November through April, and I am willing to drive all over the country (especially to warmer places) if this works out.

Lemme start with she has been thin her whole life eats all she can and never can get over 120 pounds at 5’6 and nice hips and curves, she looks great, very pretty in the face, blonde hair, I loved her. 
I’m not gonna get into the details but a few months ago I noticed she wasn’t places that she was saying she was going when I would see her location And I made the stupid decision of going through her phone, obviously knowing what I would find.
I’m not positive how long and I haven’t confronted her about it. She doesn’t know that I found out. I know two wrongs don’t make a right. But I don’t really care at this point a little revenge seemed justified.

I thought what can feed her that will make her balloon and No one will want her again. What if I just slip a bit of heavy cream into her coffee and more into her cereal in the morning so that’s what I did
Start her day with over a 1k cals and that’s all u really gotta do of course I would give her snack all day and make sure she ate plenty of her favorite food all the time (especially at night when she takes an edible) 

She blew up pretty fast putting on probably 20 - 30 pounds in like 3 months. She has great genes and most of it went to the hourglass shape she’s always had it’s just a bit wider and thick now. I can’t lie. It’s pretty great. She liked a bit of added curves she has never experienced before so she didn’t think much of the gain or what she’s been eating. 

As she grew so did her appetite and I don’t think she paid much attention or she just liked how the first couple pounds were landing
Eventually, every meal I would make for her and something about it heavily caloric that would easily put every meal over 1000 cal on the low end and three meals a day, one of the meals being a coffee filled with hundreds of calories of heavy cream and a heaping bowl of cereal filled with heavy cream as well. Come nighttime we would share at least a six pack of angry Orchard and eat at least a pint of ice cream if she’s really getting munchies cheesecake too. Sometimes I would lie saying I’m trying to save money by the whole case of angry Orchard, and we end up drinking Way more of any that night just to add a couple more empty calories in her. She seemed to love it and honestly so did I. 

She seemed very carefree about it that is until she started out growing her clothes. At this point, she was no longer oblivious. She stepped on the scale to reveal the number. She was 158 pounds.
She could not believe her in her mind she had put on maybe 15 pounds of curves spread evenly throughout her body, she couldn’t tell she had gotten bigger, but she didn’t know to what extent she had done. She never been anywhere even close to this weight. She has no idea what a calorie is or a deficit. The only diet she’s ever done is only drinking coffee and smoke her Vape for a day or two after a holiday season of over eat

I took this as a moment to capitalize I told her it’s completely fine and that I would love her exactly how she is. It didn’t matter to me, but if she was really committed to losing the weight and getting her figure back to where it was, I would help from this point, only coffee (filled with heavy cream) and a protein shake (mass gainer) in the morning
A smoothie for lunch (no real fruit just one of those naked smoothie with more heavy cream) and by the time she would get home for dinner she will be starving. It wouldn’t matter how big a feast I make she would eat till her stomach was full. Probably what one would call a Binge eating disorder

The next couple months were so sexy her always being ravenously hungry. All of her calories were liquid so despite being in a surplus. Nothing was filling. She started to binge larger than I’ve ever seen her eat at night. To the point where her stomach would start to hurt and she would just go to bed, belly distended.

It’s like the moment she started restricting her fat distribution started to change. More fat started building up around her belly. Her arms were getting fatter Her already fluffy cheeks We’re now turning into a round face and double chin and don’t get me wrong her thighs and butt were reaching a size that was unbelievable and so sexy, her tits are huge her rack got in the way of everything

I could tell there was a bit of an attitude shift eventually She was now probably up 50 - 60 pounds and everybody was noticing. For the first 20 to 40 pounds, just kind of accentuated her hourglass curves. Friends would give comments about how they’re jealous of her larger rack and butt. However the last couple pounds are really starting to stick to her midsection her gut was rounding out giving it the appearance she’s been drinking a lot of beer or in her case angry Orchards
Her increased appetite for both booze and food went from cute and quirky to a little worrying for her friends and family. The closer she approached 200 pounds.

And it almost seems like she’s began to reach a point of acceptance slowly, eating more for breakfast, lunch and dinner adding snacks
It’s like I didn’t need to influence her to eat more at all. She was just doing it on her own for appetite, run, wild and she gave up the hope of ever seeing that small version again.

What do you think? Should I stop here? Should I continue making her big? Should I reveal what I’ve been doing this whole time? She’s nearly 200 pounds and honestly above every part I don’t see why stop.

He’d been in the shower nearly an hour. He was going to be late for work.

“I’m fine, Ma”, Colin slurred. “The water feels *amazing* today.”

“Um…ok” I said. “Just don’t take too long.”

“I’m fine” Colin repeated, almost to himself.

“Just…fine…”

As I turned, I saw the note next to the sink, scrawled in a shaky hand. 

“*dOn’T dRinK…”*

The rest was gibberish, but I understood.

After his divorce, Colin had to move back home. He spent the first three days alone in his room. Spoke to no one. Eventually, I became so worried I had to force the lock.

That’s when I found the empty bottles.

I tried to help him. But after he lost his fourth job in a year for drinking, I gave him an ultimatum — he could get help, or get out. He came back from rehab a changed man. He’d leave little affirmations on notes around the house. *”We wont drink today”* or *”We control our fate”*. He even got promoted at his new job with the local water treatment plant. I was so proud.

Now, I worried he’d fallen off the wagon.

I took a walk in the park to clear my head. Hearing a splash, I found a man rolling about in the fountain, fully clothed.

“Are you alright?” I asked.

He smiled, a thoughtless mile-wide gape that made me want to run.

“It feels so good” he said, extending his hand. “Won’t you come in?”

“N-no thanks.”. 

Before I could move, a woman leapt in beside him, smashing her head against the stone. She smiled at me, even as the water ran red.

Something was wrong.

I ducked into a coffee shop to check the news. But no sooner had I opened the door was I standing in an inch of water.

“What the fuck?”

Water streamed from beneath a locked bathroom door. I thought I heard…*laughter*, faintly, on the other side. 

I was beginning to panic. The sidewalks were nearly deserted now. On my street, I saw one of my neighbors climbing headfirst into a bucket. 

He wept when it tipped over.

At home, I found Colin still in the shower. 

“Colin”, I cried, “what the hell is going on outside?”

He didn’t answer. I threw back the curtain to find Colin gazing up into the now ice-cold water, eyes unblinking.

I grabbed his shoulders, tried to snap him out of it.

“Colin”, I cried. “Baby, what’s wrong?

His mouth twitched and his eyes rolled, as if every word was agony. From the next room, an emergency news bulletin blared.

“A national state of emergency has been declared. A new, parasitic infection…”

*”Don’t…”*, Thomas gagged.

“…infection spreading at an alarming rate. EXTREME caution is…”

“*drink…”*

“The horsehair worm can alter the mind of…”

Colin twitched as a thick, black thread slithered from his mouth.

“…causing the infected host to seek out water and drown itself…”

*”the water…”*

Short Bio: Vancouver boy born and raised, of Chinese Canadian decent, 9^(th) generation to Canada. Is built like a brick shithouse that houses a server inside. He is, or rather was, a large fan of the Vancouver Canucks. Even if they still hadn’t won the Stanley cup before the evacuation of Earth. He lost a lot of his family that wasn’t able to make it off world during the bombing and it he is suffering from survivors guilt. This has also led him to have a large hatred for The Federation, especially the Krakotal.

  
Harsh light beat down and burned the eyes. A soft beeping and rhythmic pumping echoed through the hospital. Things had been a flurry of activity for the past fifteen hours since the Thunderbolt had essentially crash landed in the hanger, though thankfully most of the crew had only gotten away with minor injuries. Those that hadn’t were either recovering, awaiting augmentation surgery, or dying.

Thankfully the last category was small and mostly reserved for those that were burned beyond hope.

Dax glared at the ceiling, cursing the over bright lights in his room. Only a few flashes of the past day or so had come to him and they made him wince. There was the screams of Team Ferro, the fire the Feds had brought to the Thunderbolt, Sparky being lobotomized, and that explosion. The fact that it had ripped a hole in the hull was impressive, the howl of the wind made him shudder.

Like some ancient beast from back home you only hear stories about. Something that the clan told misbehaving whelps to get them to stop being destructive idiots.

He needed his guitar and a stiff drink. But the nurses and doctor had told him no under any circumstances. At least until after his own augmentation surgery to replace his right leg, most of his tail, and right ear.

If anything, he would be able to tune out the sound of the Thunderbolt once it was hopefully back in service. Even if it meant that the aug was now permanent rather than removable. Though maybe he should look into that human cloning tech when he had the chance, they might be able to make a new inner ear for him.

The door opened as he tried to get some rest, though he didn’t recognize the footsteps. They sounded…metallic and unsure of themselves and there was a low hum and whine as servos moved not just the feet, but the whole body it seemed. The mystery person seemed to be taking their time before coming into view.

“Whoever you are I can hear you. I won’t bite and the nurse has me on antacids again.”

A sound resembling a sigh came from around the corner of the room. Slowly a hand grasped the corner and a head timidly poked out. Whoever they where they weren’t a biological being at all, purely mechanical. Their eyes looked at him with a burning curiosity that felt strangely familiar, and they seemed to want to say some smart-ass comment to him. Probably about being stuck in bed and not being able to do anything before breaking into friendly banter.

“H..h.hhello Dax.” The figure said nervously. “It’s good to see you awake again.”

Something about the voice, the way it spoke, the odd intonation and cadence made his mind scream that he knew who this was. Even if they weren’t essentially yelling at him. Though the feminine tone threw things off a bit.

“Sparky?”

Sparky came fully around the corner, embarrassed at the body it had been given temporarily while its original core was fixed or replaced. It looked like it had already done some modifications to the body as well, giving the kobold shaped body a more curvaceous and feminine appearance. Probably to screw with the crew once things started to get normal again.

“Yes, it is me.” It muttered, hands behind its back and head down cast. “I don’t like this body; it’s too small and everything feels strange and I have to charge it nearly once a day.”

It raised his head and looked Dax in the eyes for the first time in both their lives.

“I want the ship back; this feels so confining!”

A chuckle escaped Dax unbidden. Seeing his friend like this was tragic and frustrating sure. But he also found it funny that Sparky now had to see how life was for everyone else for a while.

“What’s so funny you idiot?”

“Sorry, sorry.” He waived his hand, trying his best to calm himself. “But I thought you would be erased or wouldn’t remember me all that well, or at all, considering what happened.”

He motioned to the chair next to his bed.

“Take a seat silly and let’s talk. Though I want to give you a hug first if you would want. Just a welcome to being small and not a ship at the moment.”

Carefully Sparky made its way around the bed, being careful to not stumble over its new feet again. Having a smaller body was throwing it for a loop, especially the lack of processing power limiting its abilities. But this was necessary while the Thunderbolt was repaired and a new core installed. Though Tlamical’s pestering didn’t help its mood in the slightest. Maybe this hug would help.

There was a flutter of blankets from the bed as Dax moved himself into position. Even missing most of his right leg and tail he wanted to show his friend he cared. Then after that he’d have to see about the rest of them as well, especially Michael. The thought of the massive human being wounded or dead bothered him.

With outstretched arms he grabbed Sparky’s new body and brought it close. It was a little cold, slightly metallic, and had a faint whine from the servos. But it felt good to know that one of his friends was alive and he could give them a hug.

The AI’s arms trembled slightly as it raised them. This was a totally new sensation for it and what limited sensors it had informed it that this was a good thing, that the proper thing to do was to return the hug.

Robotic arms wrapped around Dax’s chest and squeezed, which got an even bigger response from the disabled kobold. This hug concept felt good and would defiantly have to be explored more.

After a few moments Dax released Sparky from his embrace and the AI lingered for a few moments.

“Enjoying yourself Sparkster?”

Sparky released Dax quickly.

“I think so yes. I was listening to your heart and estimating your blood pressure.” It responded. “Would you like to know what I think it is?”

Before Dax could respond a voice from behind cut him off.

“I see your little AI friend found you awake Mr. Copperhead. She has been asking about you for the past few hours to see if you were up yet.”

Turning to face the voice Dax saw the human nurse and could feel the frustration coming off Sparky. The AI didn’t like being referred to by anything other than it or its, because in its mind it was an it and didn’t need any sort of thing like a gender. Not that he couldn’t fault the human nurse, in her eyes all she saw was a feminine presenting droid that wanted to see their friend.

“Sparky prefers to be called it.”

Embarrassment ran across the nurse’s face like lighting. “I’m so sorry I didn’t mean to assume, but when I saw its body I…”

“It’s alright.” Dax replied. “I’m sure Sparky will play some childish prank on you later to ‘get back at you’. You wouldn’t do that would you Sparky?”

“Of course not.”

“And why do I not believe you for a second you rambunctious bucket of bolts.”

Sparky stuck its tongue out behind Dax’s back as he addressed the nurse.

“This is for my surgery, right?”

“Yes, it is!” The nurse said cheerfully. “If you like I can go over what will be done or we can just head to the OR now and everything will be installed and you will be ready to go in a few hours!”

Dax looked at his amputated right leg. Both it and his tail had to be removed fairly close to his body. Though thankfully he still had full function of his dick so if he wanted to sire whelps it wouldn’t be too expensive. The eye and ear replacement were more concerning though. Logically he knew his hearing would be fine and his vision would actually be a little better. But the thought of those kinds of augmentations, even as replacements for his lost parts, always weirded him out.

But it was either got those augs or be discharged and probably not play music again.

“No that’s ok. Let’s just get this over with.”

Carefully the nurse helped him back into the bed while Sparky watched the whole display. When they were ready to go the AI insisted on pushing its friend to the OR and the nurse was more than happy to let it do so. Both the kobold and the AI seemed to appreciate the gesture and closeness.

Once they arrived at the door to the OR the nurse stopped them.

“I’m sorry Sparky, but you are not allowed past here. We’d have to clean your body very thoroughly and make you wear a hazard suit.”

Sparky pouted. “Are you sure? I wouldn’t trust this idiot to know how to wake back up if I wasn’t there.”

The nurse sighed. “Be that as it may it would take a few days to make sure you are sterilized fully and Mr. Copperhead’s window has come up.”

She knelt down and looked into the AI’s eyes.

“I’ll make sure to give you some updates on his condition and progress if you would like?”

Sparky nodded.

“What’s your contact credentials then? It will be faster for me to send them over a secure link then come and find you.” She said with a wink.

Quickly Sparky relayed its information and watched its friend be wheeled off to the OR. Of all the places to see an android it never thought there would be one in the hospital. Not that it was surprising in the slightest, Sparky just never expected it.

It signed and headed towards the waiting area to find something to plug into.



A week had past since the surgery and Dax was finally walking out of the hospital. It felt good to be out of the blinding lights, over sterilized air and back into the belly of the Stormdancer. It was dim, smelled like stale farts, and was dusty in all the wrong places; but it was his home away from home while deployed. He’d been able to get in touch with Raf, Auntie Yella, Percy, and Mikey which helped things. Mikey would be discharged from the hospital in a few days and Percy was working with the doctors to make sure the Thunderbolts crew was taken care of. That just left Raf and Auntie Yella to bother, though both would probably be busy with other things or someone.

Especially in Raf’s case. The cook’s husband would be making sure that his little lizard didn’t do anything too strenuous for a few more days and would make sure he got lots of exercise. Terry was a good man and the best thing to happen to Raf.

Auntie Yella would probably be hiding in Ralvain’s apartment and not wanting to see anyone other than the good admiral. Though it would be a good idea to keep her in the loop that her best second lieutenant was out and ready to serve again. In a month, when the doctors cleared him from physio.

“Why does this place have to be so big?” Sparky asked as it excited the hospital. “I understand logically why, but conceptually why does it have to be so big?”

“Ego, I think.” Dax replied. “Well, if anything we can head to my place and relax there. I don’t feel up to wandering around Stormdancer right now if that’s ok with you.”

“If it’s interior is anything like it’s systems then I have already seen it all.” Sparky said.

Dax nodded and set off towards his personal apartment, cane and new leg clicking in time with each other as they went. All in all, the augs weren’t as bad as he thought at first. His hearing hadn’t changed too much, he could see relevant information without his helmet, and his tail had space to add surprises into it later if he wanted. And he had ideas for those surprises if Percy was willing to do them.

They could be a “Canadian tradition” he would say, whatever that meant. But Dax had learned not to ask the Doctor too many questions about his old home. As far as the humans of Romtsast knew they were the last of their kind as their old planet had been glassed a few years back.

The pair walked towards the transit station, Sparky doing its best to hide the wonder in its mechanical eyes. Dax for his part was just enjoying the fact he got to wear a pair of jeans and a t-shirt again rather than the hospital gown. Auntie Yella had dropped by the barracks and personal quarters of every crewbold that was in the hospital. Despite what other captains and ships said she cared for each and every member of her crew, no matter their species.

His belly growled as they got to the transit station.

“Hey..uuhhh…Sparky?”

“Yes Dax?”

Dax rubbed his belly to try and quite it. “Would you be ok if we popped by a snack shack and I grabbed myself something to eat? I think the hospital food did a number on me and I’m cravin’ a shitty burger or something.”

“Well, the food at the sixth district hospital is not meant to taste very good; but to be healthy and help you recover from injuries.”

“But my body demands garbage food full of grease, salt and fats.” He moaned.

Sparky pinched its nose. “Look I am not your parental unit and I can’t tell you no. The medical staff and Cpt. Lonal just asked me to make sure that you eat properly. Go put cheap food in you if you want; but I am following that directive starting tomorrow.”

“Deal!”

Scanning the crowed plaza for some food stand that would be agreeable, Dax finally settled on a burger shack. It was nearly empty, smelled of cheap synthmeat, overheated fry oil, and questionable cheeses. But this is what he wanted right now, a salad and lean synthmeats could wait. It was burger time!

The owner and cook was a lanky Ooumnaré wearing an apron over top his spotted fur. Most of the grease that covered him was soaking through the apron. Most. He gave the kobold a flat look, grabbed a meat patty from the fridge and plopped it down on the solitary, blackened grill. Most cooks would be diligent about preventing cross-contamination, given the TSG’s mix of herbivores and carnivores. Most.

In short order Dax had a rather greasy looking bag of fries and an even greasier burger. While he might thoroughly enjoy Raf’s cooking. Sometimes you just needed a questionable burger from a questionable food stall in District six. As long as you didn’t ask questions, accepted what was offered, and paid, the cook didn’t complain.

He quickly finished the meal before he and Sparky got to the train and tossed the garbage in the trash.

The train ride was thankfully uneventful back to his neighborhood. Just a few solders on leave having a good time and heading back to their barracks drunk, a family heading towards one of the parks. And him and Sparky standing near the door. Two stations later they were in District six and a half, as some called it, and left the train.

Only two more blocks and he was home and could sleep in his bed for the next while until he was cleared for active duty. And thankfully the walk was uneventful aside from a few children pointing in curiosity at Sparky. Even on a ship as massive as the Stormdancer full formed droids were uncommon outside of the engineering and manufacturing sectors.

“I don’t like that they stare Dax. Why do they have to stare?”

Dax shook his head. “Kids will stare at anything they think is interesting sadly. It took a while but they eventually got bored of me.”

He placed a hand on the AIs shoulder and squeezed. “Tell you what. We can do something tomorrow that should keep us away from them. Sound good?”

Sparky nodded. For whatever reason it felt the need to be near Dax. He was a good friend and had never judged it harshly; but this protectiveness was an odd program to have running. Especially automatically. It would have to run a systems check later.

Finally, they reached Dax’s apartment, or the entrance to it at least. It was a door set back from the street, unmarked other than the address. The door squeaked as it opened.

“Good to see ya again Dax!” The cobold security guard called out. “I’erd yer ship got shit kicked last week an you was in the hospital?”

Dax nodded to the security guard. “Yeah an I got a nice shiny new leg and tail for it. Same with an eye and a plate in my dome.”

The security guard laughed, his canine voice making it sound like a harsh yelp.

“Tis good, tis good. Oh also there’s a couple of packages for ya. ‘Rived three days back ‘n I kept’em in the back for ya. From yer home world too so they must be good!”

Before Dax could say anything, the security guard ducked into his little office to grab the parcels. He had a reasonable guess as to who sent them and he was thankful his Dad was looking out for him. When they got upstairs he’d have to give the old wyrm a call.

“I also see ya gotta ‘friend’ ‘ith ya to. Didn’ know ya liked’em…digital there Dax.”

Dax glowered at the security guard as he took the packages from him, not saying anything and letting his annoyance at the comment hang in the air.

He and Sparky went to the elevator and rode it in silence. The security guard’s comment bothered both of them. Though neither could rightly place why that was, and it bothered both of them. Especially Dax, it really ate at him on a level he couldn’t place.

When they arrived at Dax’s floor he led Sparky to his door and it opened automatically at its owner’s presence.

“Welcome to my little lair away from my lair Sparkster.” He said as he laid the parcels on the counter. “Make yourself at home, there’s a basic charging station next to the coffee table and game controllers on the table.”

Sparky nodded as it watched Dax. It had never thought it would see Dax’s personal apartment for itself. He had told it about his little space, that he had a room dedicated to music for when he was back and a good setup for game and movie nights when they were all on shore leave.

Gingerly it sat on his couch, enjoying the subtle firmness hidden under its softness. The upholstery creaked under its weight.

“I think your couch it broken Dax?”

There was a chuckle from Dax as he looked around for something to open the parcels with.

“Nothing’s wrong silly. It’s made of leather and I probably have to condition it again. We’ve been on patrol for about six months.”

“Interesting.”

Eventually Dax pulled out a knife from a drawer and paused. He should really call his father first before he opened anything. The old wyrm would want to see his son’s face.

Taking out his phone he started a video call, hoping his father would be awake at the moment. It didn’t take long for the phone to be answered and a smiling craggy draconic face greeted him.

“It’s good to see you back home my boy!” His father said with a smile. “The doctors didn’t want to put up with having me call them every day to make sure you’re doing well?”

“No dad,” Dax laughed. “Though I think I did hear one of the janitors say that you looked rather dashing and he saw where I got my good looks!”

“And you didn’t give him my number? Give it to him the next time you see him; he sounds like he has good taste in men if you as me.”

“I guess I can do that.” Dax groaned. It would be the first time he’d be playing wingman for his father. But the old dragon deserved to meet someone that would care for him like his mother had.

Setting aside his father’s love life Dax started opening the smaller of the two boxes. He had his suspicions as to what the longer one was and he wanted to wait for that one.

Him and his dad chatted about the things that had been sent in the smaller package. It was mostly snacks and a few gift cards that could be used on the Stormdancer. Though the best was the bottle of spirits from home. Not something that many outside of Calanst due to how long it took to make the stuff and how expensive it was. Unless you knew someone that could get you the good stuff, which damn near everyone back home did.

Cracking the top, he gave the bottle a sniff and was reminded of home.

“Well now, enough of those goodies Dax. I want to see what you think of the other package!” He father yipped.

Dax eyed the other package. It was almost the perfect length and width for what he hoped it wasn’t, maybe a little wider at the sides then it should be. But his father would keep pestering him until he opened the box.

Hands shaking, he slit the tape, using the tip of his chief’s knife to open the box. What was inside caught him by surprise. It looked like his father had sent him an SMG, not something that was standard issue in the TSG unless you were a tanker, rider, or a pilot. But he was bridge so he didn’t even get a carbine like the rest of the crew.

“Uuuhhh Dad.” He stuttered. “You know Auntie Yella would…”

“I know, I know son.” His father raised a paw to stop his son. “I spoke with Yeldana about both things in that package and she’s fine with them being on the ship, even if you just use the pea shooter for plinking targets. The second item took some convincing though.”

Placing the SMG down Dax looked at the remaining item with dread. With those words his father had all but confirmed what remained in the box.

“Go on Dax. It is yours by right and you know that.”

“I…Iii…I know” He stammered. “Iii..Iits..It’s jus.”

“You don’t want to lose a family heirloom on some fare flung field of battle I know. But your mother would want you to have it and Ol’Smokey^(1) would be proud to know it was lost doing the right thing. It’s ok Dax.”

Slowly he removed the last of the packing and picked up the remaining object in his trembling right hand.

*Breath Dax, breath.* He reminded himself. *It’s just an irreplaceable family item that technically doesn’t exist according to the TSG. No big deal.*

The black leather of the scabbard drank what light hit it, the brass hardware fighting for what little light managed to come to it. Tanned black dragon hide, brass dragon scales for hardware. You couldn’t make something like this anymore without a pile of legal paperwork, multiple signed wills, and the Department of Resources finally giving the okay for it. And that was even before you could make the blade itself.

Unsheathing the blade he held it before his snout. You had to admire the level of craftsboldship that went into it. There were no extra ornaments, carvings, or decorations on the blade. Just a single piece of metal, hammered into shape and sharpened on both sides. Just like Ol’Smokey liked.

The only difference was that it was a flat, dull gray rather than bright steel or mythral.

“Carry it with pride my boy.” His father said. “I love you and I will talk to you next week. Also hello Dax’s friend! Please make sure he remembers to eat!”

“I will and love you too Dad.” Dax replied.

The call ended and Dax kept looking at the blade, feeling its weight. Not the physical weight mind. More the spiritual and metaphorical weight the sword carried. It had seen many battles, killed many, and had been remade a number of times. But it was still Ol’Smokey’s sword through and through.

“Your father sent you snacks and weapons?” Sparky asked.

“Yeah.”

“But why would he do something like that, it’s illogical and inefficient with the quarter master on board.”

It came close to the sword, analyzing the blade the best its limited mind could.

“This sword is odd. My sensors say it’s one thing, but I don’t know if I trust the weak things to tell me the truth.”

Dax sighed. “No, they’re probably right.”

“So this is…?”

“Adamantine yes, natural adamantine^(2) forged in my homeland for Ol’Smokey the Brave. Technically I am breaking the law just by holding it, even more so because this sword ttteecchhhnically doesn’t exist in the TSG databases for natural adamantine items.”

Sparky shook its head. So its friend now had in his possession a long sword that could cut through nearly anything, and he was going to carry it on a ship. In space. With it on board.

Sounded like a bad time for anyone that crossed their paths.





^(1):Galia: You mentioned this…Old Smokey before but didn’t say much other then he sired your ancestor Bituman. Who was he?



Dax: He’s an old clan head that used to be a high-ranking officer in the Empire of Five Dragons military. He got disgraced after saving his daughter from a sexual assault and eventually led the rebellion that freed Calanst from Empire control. He’s a hero.



^(2):Galia: I have never heard of this metal adamantine before. What is it?



Dax: It’s a dark gray exo-element that is found in the TSG, though it is rather rare to find natural deposits of it and any item made from it is registered, or rather should be. My sword isn’t (though it probably will be now that I am talking about it) and shouldn’t be allowed off my home world. These days we syntheses it for use in our fusion reactors along with thorium and molten salt. It is dense as hell and an absolute bastard to sharpen; but once it’s sharp it can cut through damn near anything.

1o5s9zd,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeTroubleshooters/comments/1o5s9zd/your_garbage_disposal_smells_like_mold_heres_how/,Your garbage disposal smells like mold? Here’s how to fix it in under 15 minutes,"# 🧼 TL;DR

You don’t need fancy cleaners — just a bit of **soap, ice, salt, baking soda, vinegar, and citrus**. Do this regularly, and your garbage disposal will stay fresh, mold-free, and quiet for years.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your garbage disposal smells musty or moldy, it’s usually because of **trapped food gunk and moisture** — the perfect combo for mold and bacteria to grow. Luckily, you can fix it permanently with stuff you already have at home.

**Here’s how** 👇

# 🕵️ Step 1: Find Where That Funky Smell Is Coming From

* **Check the splash guard** — that rubber ring traps greasy food bits under the flaps.
* **Use a flashlight** to look for black or white mold on the walls inside.
* **Look for stuck items** like dishcloths or food chunks that may have fallen in.

# 🧽 Step 2: Scrub the Visible Parts

* Use **dish soap + an old toothbrush** to scrub the metal rim.
* Lift the **rubber splash guard** and clean underneath — this is often *the* main culprit.
* Wipe down the **sink area** around the disposal too.

# 🔥 Step 3: Flush with Hot, Soapy Water

* Fill the sink halfway with **hot water and dish soap**.
* While it’s full, **run the disposal**, then pull the drain plug to flush everything through.
* Let it run another 10–15 seconds after the water drains to clear any leftover grime.

# 🧊 Step 4: Use Ice + Salt to Scrub the Blades

* Drop in **1 cup ice cubes** and **½ cup kosher salt**.
* Turn on **cold water + the disposal** to grind it all up.
* You’ll hear the grinding stop once it’s done — that’s your sign it’s clean inside.

# 🧪 Step 5: Deodorize with Baking Soda + Vinegar

* Pour in **½ cup baking soda**, then **1 cup vinegar**.
* Let it fizz for **10–15 minutes** to kill odor-causing bacteria.
* Rinse with **cold water** for 30 seconds while running the disposal.

# 🍋 Step 6: Add a Natural Fresh Scent

* Toss in **lemon or orange peels** for a clean, fresh smell.
* Run **cold water** while grinding to avoid any acid damage.
* Do this **once a week** to keep things smelling great.

# 🚫 Step 7: Prevent Future Moldy Smells

* Don’t put **grease, coffee grounds, or eggshells** down the drain — they cause buildup.
* Run **cold water for 10–20 seconds** before and after each use.
* Do a quick **ice + salt clean weekly**, and a deeper clean monthly.

With sunrise sneaking in at 5:29 AM, how is anyone supposed to sleep? I shuffle out of bed, let the dog out, and move through my slow morning rhythm. My bones creak their usual protest as I fill the coffeemaker with fresh grounds and water. It sputters and sighs to life, filling the air with that rich, earthy scent that feels like comfort itself.



That first mug gets me started, steadying the mind before the day begins: emails, paperwork, and endless to-dos. A refill or two keeps me company through the afternoon while I dive into the creative work that truly wakes me up. By the afternoon, maybe a final pour to toast another day well spent.



So tell me, what’s in your mug today? Do you take it black, sweet, creamy, or with a little weekend “kick”? What small ritual starts your day on the right note?",3,1760380828.0,ArtFestival,2,1.0,False

Marcus was unassuming—tall with a lean build, tousled brown hair, and hazel eyes that often hid behind glasses. His days blurred in the glow of dual monitors, but his nights were haunted by a secret craving: a deep-seated feet fetish that had simmered since his teenage years. He devoured online forums about [foot worship](https://feetporntube.com/), toe sucking, and the erotic allure of soles, but in real life, it remained a fantasy, buried under layers of shyness.

Next door, in a cozy bungalow painted sky blue, moved in Sophia Reyes, a 28-year-old freelance photographer fresh from the city chaos. Sophia was a vision of effortless beauty—petite with sun-kissed olive skin, long raven hair that fell in waves to her waist, and emerald eyes that sparkled with mischief. Her figure was athletic yet curvaceous, honed from yoga sessions, but it was her feet that would unknowingly become the centerpiece of Marcus’s obsession: size 7, perfectly arched with high insteps, soft heels, and toes painted in vibrant hues that matched her adventurous spirit. She often wandered barefoot in her yard, her soles leaving faint imprints on the grass, a sight that Marcus caught glimpses of from his window.

Their first meeting was serendipitous, on a balmy evening when Sophia’s moving truck blocked the shared driveway. Marcus, returning from work, parked on the street and approached to offer help. “Need a hand with those boxes?” he asked, his voice steady despite the flutter in his chest as he noticed her flip-flops slapping against her heels.

Sophia turned, flashing a warm smile that lit up her face. “Oh, you’re a lifesaver! I’m Sophia, your new neighbor.” As they carried boxes inside, their conversation flowed easily—about her love for capturing candid moments, his tech world escapades. But Marcus’s eyes drifted downward, fixated on her feet as she kicked off her sandals at the door, revealing smooth, pedicured soles dusted with a hint of moving-day dirt. The sight stirred something primal in him, a rush of heat that made his pulse quicken. This was the start of a feet sex story that would consume them both.

Over the next weeks, their neighborly interactions deepened. Sophia invited Marcus for coffee, and he helped her set up her home studio. One afternoon, as they sat on her porch swing, Sophia stretched her legs, crossing her ankles on the railing. Her feet, bare and relaxed, dangled invitingly—toes wiggling absentmindedly, arches curving gracefully. Marcus felt a magnetic pull; he imagined tracing his tongue along those soles, inhaling the faint scent of lavender lotion she used. “You okay?” she teased, noticing his gaze. He blushed, mumbling about the weather, but Sophia’s eyes twinkled with curiosity. She had her own secrets—a budding interest in exploring kinks, sparked by erotic novels she’d read during lonely nights.

The tension built subtly. Marcus found excuses to visit: fixing her Wi-Fi, sharing takeout. Each time, Sophia’s feet became the unspoken focal point. She’d prop them on the coffee table during movies, her soles facing him, wrinkled slightly from the day’s wear. Marcus’s fetish intensified; at night, he’d fantasize about massaging them, sucking her toes until she moaned. Little did he know, Sophia sensed his fixation. One evening, after a glass of wine, she playfully complained about sore feet from a photoshoot hike. “Mind giving me a rub? You’re good with your hands, right?”

Marcus’s heart hammered. “Sure,” he replied, his voice husky. Kneeling before her on the couch, he took her left foot in his palms. Her skin was warm, velvety soft, with a subtle arch that fit perfectly in his grasp. He pressed his thumbs into her sole, circling the ball of her foot, feeling the tension melt away. Sophia sighed contentedly, her toes flexing—long and elegant, nails painted crimson. The intimacy was electric; Marcus’s cock stirred in his pants as he inhaled the faint, musky scent mixed with her lotion. “That feels amazing,” she murmured, her eyes half-lidded. Emboldened, he lifted her foot higher, his lips brushing her instep in what could pass as an accidental graze. Sophia didn’t pull away; instead, she watched him intently, a spark of arousal igniting in her core.

That foot massage marked the turning point in their feet sex story. Sophia, intrigued by his reverence, researched foot fetishes online, discovering the world of podophilia—worshipping feet as erogenous zones. She found it empowering, a way to tease and control. The next day, she texted Marcus: “Come over. I have a surprise.” He arrived to find her in a short sundress, seated on her bed with a bottle of oil. “I want more of that magic,” she said, patting the spot beside her.

> In Jon Kent: This Internship Is My Kryptonite by writer Sam Camp (Little Hollow Café) and artists Daimon Hampton and Seraji, Jon Kent is a super-powered hero in his own right, but how do those powers help him move beyond the mundane coffee orders, endless research, and “educational experience” the Daily Planet reporting staff deems necessary for those essential college credits? Especially when your mom is the editor-in-chief—hello, nepotism concerns!

>What’s more, his best friend thinks the internship is a waste of his time and talents, his boyfriend tries to be supportive but is wary of Jon’s new boss’s Superman obsession, and naturally his parents think this is a great opportunity, but life as a superhero daylighting as a reporter is a little different today than it was back then…

1o5s7ii,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o5s7ii,Our mid-September trip,"TL/DR:  
Red-eye flight to Iceland — rough sleep but worth it! Spent the week exploring waterfalls, hot springs, and horses: Blue Lagoon, Gjáin, Háifoss, Brúarfoss, Laxnes Horse Farm, and Reykjavík. Ferry to the Westman Islands got canceled, so we hit Seljalandsfoss, Gljúfrabúi, and Nauthúsafoss instead — all amazing. Loved the views in Vík, the hot tub at Hotel Katla, and Reykjavík’s food, bars, and museums. Perfect mix of adventure and relaxation



Friday

·         Red-eye flight

o   We were in the exit row which was nice, but there was a lady next to me that was too large for the seat. Hard to sleep, uncomfortable from leaning the entire flight

 

Saturday           

·         Car Rental Shuttle (Lotus)

o   2 alternating vans, very unorganized with a lot of people waiting. A good 45 minutes and had to be vocal about getting on the next van (3rd time was the charm!) People who had not waited as long were trying to jump the line.

·         Car Rental Pickup

o   We rented the Kia Sportage 4x4 with Platinum insurance. Did the self pickup - typed in our reservation code and a box popped open with the keys. We were in the car with luggage and had time figuring out all of the controls before the first counter-pickup person was in the lot.

·         Drive to Blue Lagoon

o   Took the longer route to the Blue Lagoon, stopped to see the bridge between continents which was a fun time to kill a few minutes, letting us arrive right on time

·         Blue Lagoon

o   Premium tickets, very easy check in and they answered all of our questions. With the premium we had our bathrobes before going into the changing area, which was very nice. Figured out the locker and tested it to ensure if was locked. They had changing rooms but you could also change right there in the locker area. Put on the bath robe and went to the showers, showered and put on bathing suit. Bath robe rentals for standard tickets were available right before you went into the lagoon. Really enjoyed the lagoon more than we thought we would. They weren’t checking/ charging for masks so we could get as many as we wanted. Did the drinks that came with our tickets. Favorite part was the swim-in steam room. Loved all the different areas, swimming around and exploring.

·         AirBNB check-in

o   Stayed outside of Reykjavik city center, in Breiðholt. Easy check in, grabbed some dinner at the supermarket and fell asleep. Blue Lagoon was really relaxing…we had planned to get dinner out but were too tired!

 

Sunday

·         Highlands & Brúarfoss

o   Woke up early and headed out to Gjáin. Enjoyed the scenery on the way out, saw some fun super jeeps. Turned off 32 onto 327. Arrived around 9am and had the whole area to ourselves. Really pretty autumn colors, had fun exploring the area. A little over an hour in total – left around 10:15 am

o   Drove up the road to Háifoss (continuing on 327 to 332). We had a lot of fun on the gravel road. Arrived around 11:15 am and started hiking down to the bottom around 11:30. Reached the bottom at 12:12pm. I’d say a moderate hike, and 100% worth it. Took our time, had hiking poles. Back at the top and left the area around 1:30pm

o   Started heading towards Brúarfoss and stopped to see Skálholt Cathedral on the way. Enjoyed this quick stop, the small museum in the basement, and the turf church.

o   Arrived at Brúarfoss around 4pm – a little bit of a shock from the morning to the amount of people we saw there. Very busy! First paid parking lot we encountered. Had already set up our car in Parka and Easy Park so just checked in and we were ready to go. Not a long stop, maybe 15 minutes.

o   Maybe 5 minutes away we stopped at Efstidalur II for a meal. Fun sitting upstairs and watching the cows while eating burgers! Walked downstairs to have some ice cream afterwards. Some of the creamiest ice cream I’ve ever had! Was delicious!

o   Originally had plans to make one more stop in Þingvellir, but we were exhausted and our AirBNB only had one thin pillow per bed. We ended up going to IKEA, grabbing some pillows and relaxing for the night.

Monday

·         Horseback Riding

o   Went to Laxnes Horse Farm for a morning ride. They offer in-town pickup but we decided to drive out there. Got there a little early and Haukur Thorarinsson was there, came out and invited us inside for some coffee. Had a lot of fun chatting with him before our ride. Ride was fun, beautiful scenery and was a good pace as well! Arrived around 9:30am, ride was done at 12pm.

·         Hraunfossar & Barnafoss

o   These waterfalls were on my list due to time time of year & how others reported the pretty autumn colors. We really loved the drive up there, taking the Hvalfjörður Tunnel (no tolls) was a unique experience, and really pretty farmland the whole way up. Arrived at 2pm, spent 30 minutes exploring the area. Hraunfossar was much larger than we expected! Another early night, as we had the Westman Islands ferry booked the next day.

Tuesday

·         Ferry was cancelled – Alternative day plans

o   We received an email late Monday evening saying there was a potential for the ferry to be cancelled, so we moved our Wednesday plans to Tuesday. Ultimately ferry was canceled Tuesday morning.

·         Seljalandsfoss, Gljúfrabúi, and Nauthúsafoss.

o   We planned to be on the road early since it was a 2hr drive to the ferry, and ultimately received the call for cancellation about an 1hr 30 min on our drive. Seljalandsfoss is just past the ferry point, so it made reasonable sense to have this as our alternate. We arrived right at 8 and there were maybe 15 other people there. People were really nice and offered to take pictures for us and vice versa. Definitely needed our rain gear! Paid parking here.

o   Continued down the path to Gljúfrabúi, which if you’re already parked for Seljalandsfoss I highly recommend doing. We were a little surprised at the amount of people that didn’t walk down this way. It was flat and easy to get to. Arrived back at the parking lot right before 9:30am, which was now PACKED!

o   About a 15 minute (gravel) drive down the road was Nauthúsafoss. 10/10, so happy we did this hike. A handful of people were there, but did not feel busy at all. Hiked up the river to the waterfall, but the entire hike was beautiful.

·         Vik

o   We had planned to stay this night in Vik and return to the AirBNB the next day. So we continued on to the town, stopping to see Reynisfjara Beach (paid parking) on our way in. Red warning due to the weather, but there were a lot of people close to the dangerous sea.

o   Lunch at The Soup Company around 12:30pm. After a wet and chilly day we enjoyed the bread bowls and beer. Definitely get the refill – after eating food from the supermarket for most of our meals the $90 USD price tag for two bowls of soup and two beers was an ‘omg’ moment – but we had expected it.

o   Checked out Myrdal Church & Gígjagjá Cave killing some time before our hotel check in. Gígjagjá had paid parking as well.

o   Checked into Hotel Katla by Keahotels around 3pm. Really loved this hotel. Fantastic view and we just relaxed watching the whooper swans swim across the lake. Had Brennivín and fermented shark at the bar before showering and going to the hot tub and sauna. Relaxed there for several hours before going to dinner at the Hotel Restaurant. Fantastic lamb!

Wednesday

·         Vik

o   Since our original Wednesday plans were shifted a day earlier, we stayed in Vik a little bit for the morning, enjoying sleeping in, the included hotel breakfast, shopping, and then went to see the Lava Show in Vik. Lava show was surprisingly fun, and we had delicious crepes after!

·         Reynisfjara Beach

o   Since it was a beautiful start to the morning we decided to go back to the beach. Still a red warning, but we went on the beach a bit, always keeping one eye on the water and staying on the pebble area not the sand.

·         Heading back to Reykjavik

o   Drove into rainier weather, saw Skógafoss from the road, had some hail, and saw a ton of rainbows. Finally made it to downtown Reykjavik. Lots of shops were closed by the time we made it downtown, but had a delicious dinner at Íslenski Barinn (the puffin was amazing) and had a drink at Röntgen Bar.

Thursday

·         Reykjavik Downtown day

o   Back on our original plan for the day, we started off with breakfast from Brauð & Co, sitting on a bench and looking at Hallgrimskirkja while eating our pastries.

o   Went inside Hallgrimskirkja when it opened at 10am and bought tickets to go to the belltower. Spent maybe 30 minutes total looking around the church.

o   Explored shops, saw the Icelandic Punk Museum, and had some fantastic beer at Skúli Craft bar.

o   Had to stop at the The Icelandic Phallological Museum, which was a blast and just very fun to do.

o   More shopping, and stopped at Icelandic Street Food for dinner.

Friday

·         Heading back home

o   Lazy, relaxing morning before checking out of the AirBNB and heading to a bakery for breakfast. The wind was STRONG and we made our way back to Lotus Car Rental. Since we had the platinum insurance all we had to do was turn in our keys – and then we immediately got on the shuttle to the airport. Much better experience than arrival!

o   Had some of the fanciest airport food and explored the Airport shopping, picked up Brennivín for friends and family.

o   Easy flight home, slept a good amount, saw Greenland from the window!",18,1760380744.0,VisitingIceland,1,1.0,False

I was chatting with a guy for about two weeks. Things seem to be going well. He wanted to meet around 9:30 pm on weekdays at a bar near where we both live. The only problem is that I don’t drink often and I’m usually in bed at 10 pm because I get up and workout at 5:30 am. So, we decided to meet up at a local coffee shop on Friday morning. I let him know I would be about 10 minutes late. He didn’t respond. By now, you know where this is going, don’t you? He didn’t respond to calls or text messages.
About 30 minutes later he messaged me back saying that he thought he got stood up because it has happened before so he left. When I told him I was there he mentioned something about the next time. I jokingly said he was bold to assume there would be a next time to which he responded about having a hard time making connections and being alone for the rest of his life. Then, he thanked me for my time.

1o5s2xz,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1o5s2xz/brewed_my_first_french_press_today/,Brewed my first French press today,"Bought my first French press today. Went with Blue Tokai’s Silver Oak blend. It came with a scoop, so I took about 2 scoops, roughly 16 grams for 250 ml of water.

Didn’t have a grinder, so I used the all-purpose mixer grinder every Indian household has ( that noisy beast). Got the grind to a sugar-like consistency. Brought the water to a full boil for 30 seconds, turned it off after a full boil, let it sit for 30 seconds, and poured it over the grounds. Stirred gently for 30 seconds.

After 4 minutes, I skimmed off the floating chunks with two spoons, let it sit for another 3 minutes, then slowly pressed the plunger and poured.

It looked like brown water with some sediment, but man it tasted fine. Not too bitter, not acidic. Slightly sweet, mellow, almost full-bodied. Not barista level, but I’m never going back to instant coffee again.

It had this citrusy hint with a little bitterness, but what really got me was the smell. When I ground the beans, the aroma just hit me like all those oils releasing at once. It was intoxicating.

Honestly, I think I enjoyed sniffing the beans more than drinking the coffee. Even the unground ones have this punchy, complex aroma.

People spend almost the same amount on Davidoff instant coffee. I’ve done it, and I regret it. For the same price, you can get the real deal. Instant coffee sucks, no matter the brand or the price. 

Brewed my first real cup today and yeah, I could spend all day just smelling those beans.",4,1760380466.0,IndiaCoffee,0,0.83,False

Hey, fellow creators! So, let’s chat about something that’s got everyone buzzing in the content creation community: AI. Seriously, if you haven’t hopped on this wave yet, are you even living your best life? 🤔

Just picture this: You wake up in the morning, sip your coffee (or tea, no judgments here!), and your AI buddy has drafted half your blog post while you were dreaming sweet dreams. Sound dreamy? Well, it’s totally possible! 

**Here’s how you can ride that AI wave and start cashing in:**

1. **Automate Your Content Creation**  
   Why grind for hours when you can hand off some of that work to AI? Think tweets, blog posts, or even captions for your Insta—AI can help kickstart your creativity!

2. **Content Personalization**  
   AI can scan your audience's preferences and help you craft content that hits home. Less guessing games, more genuine connection. Who wouldn’t want their followers to be like, “OMG, they GET me!”?

3. **Data-Driven Insights**  
   If you’re not analyzing your content’s performance, you’re missing out! AI tools can analyze engagement, audience behavior, and trends so that you can pivot when necessary. Talk about working smarter, not harder!

4. **Scale Up Your Efforts**  
   Imagine if you could double your output without doubling your workload. AI helps you churn out content faster so that you can spend time on other creative projects. More projects = more fun (and potentially more cash, if you play your cards right)!

5. **Budget-Friendly Resources**  
   For those of you worried about costs, not to fret! There are plenty of affordable AI tools available, like **[Easy-Peasy AI](https://easy-peasy.ai/?via=aca)**, designed specifically for creators like you. (Just a heads up, I get a lil' something if you use that link, but I'm only sharing what I genuinely believe works!)

**Quick Reminder of What Not to Do:**
- Don’t just copy-paste AI-generated content and hit “publish.” That’s a one-way ticket to cringe-town.
- Don’t forget the human touch! Use AI as a partner, not a crutch. 
- And seriously, don’t hesitate to experiment with different tools to find what suits your workflow best.

So, whether you're a seasoned creator or just starting, there’s no better time than NOW to unlock the potential of AI. Imagine the possibilities! 🌟

I will buy a hand grinder for the filter coffee eventually but i’ll have to wait to save up a little bit of money. But of course i want to start using my v60 in the meantime.

Heavenly Father,

Teach my heart to be still before You.
In a world that rushes and compares,
remind me that Your timing is perfect.

When I grow restless or afraid,
help me to trust that You are working in ways I cannot see.
When others seem to move ahead,
keep me from envy  let my eyes remain on You.

Grant me a calm spirit that waits with faith,
a heart that listens more than it complains,
and a soul anchored in Your peace.

flowing steady and sure guided by Your hand.

Amen.

TODAY'S  STORY

The Garden That Waited

Mara had worked at the same firm in Manchester for nearly ten years. She was steady and meticulous, the sort who stayed late to polish reports and help others meet their deadlines. 

People often relied on her, though they didn’t always notice how much she quietly carried.

Then came the meeting that changed everything. One of her colleagues, a confident and well spoken man, presented her idea to the management team as his own. 

The room buzzed with approval. Compliments flew in his direction, and Mara sat there, too stunned to speak, her coffee cooling beside her.

In the days that followed, the sting of injustice lingered. She smiled when she had to, but bitterness had found its way into her chest, sharp and stubborn. 

“It isn’t right,” she told a friend from church one Sunday after the service. “He’s done wrong, yet everything seems to be going his way.”

Her friend listened quietly, then reached for her Bible. After a moment of turning pages, she found what she was looking for and turned the book towards Mara.

“Look here,” she said softly. “Psalm 37, verse 7  ‘Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him.’”

She paused, her eyes warm. “God’s justice doesn’t hurry. Sometimes it moves at the pace of spring, slow to show, but certain to come.”

That evening, Mara thought about those words as she sat by her desk lamp. Each morning after, she opened her own Bible before work and read the verse again. 

Instead of replaying the betrayal in her mind, she began to pray, not for retribution, but for calm, for patience, for trust.

Months drifted by. Her colleague’s reputation, once polished and impressive, began to dull. Clients grew frustrated by unkept promises and careless mistakes. 

In time, the truth surfaced, quietly, as truth often does. The manager called Mara into his office, admitted the error, and offered her the leadership of the very project she had begun.

Later that afternoon, she sat by the office window, watching the light rain streak the glass. The city hummed below, ordinary and unhurried. She wasn’t triumphant, nor bitter. Just still.

Patience, she realised, wasn’t simply waiting it was trusting that God sees what others miss,

and that in His own time, He sets things right. Not loudly, not suddenly, but perfectly like a garden blooming at last after a long, patient spring.

----‐-----------------------------------------------------------------------
TODAY'S POEM
----‐-----------------------------------------------------------------------

“The Art of Stillness”

Beneath the rush of passing days,
Patience plants her quiet praise.
Where storms may rage and tempests cry,
She waits, and lets the moment lie.

For time, though slow, will carve its way,
And night will yield to newborn day.
The heart that waits, though bruised and worn,
Will bloom more bright when dawn is born.

----‐-----------------------------------------------------------------------
SUPPLICATIONS
----‐-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In our Prayers today, pray for patience, to be calm and reflective, not to quickly over react and become angry in the moment, but to be still.

I recently picked up a used LM Mini R secondhand and intend to try it as a lowish volume coffee cart centerpiece. The previous owner also had a cart (with full plumbing) but sold it separately before I could see how everything worked. So I am armed with the machine, a Seaflo pump, and a dream to get it plumed into a water jug using this pump but that's a whole different story. 

**What I need right now** is to figure out to to take the gd panels off this beast and see what the current setup is - if there's any plumbing infrastructure in place inside the machine at all, or if I have to do everything from scratch. Unfortunately there's minimal literature out there for the R version. 

In order to remove the panels, what needs to be unscrewed? I've read there are screws along the bottom but I can't find / see anything. I tried remove all the flathead screws along the front fascia, and the top section (above the paddles), but nothing budged, not even the cup warmer tray. Do I need to unscrew the pressure adjuster gauge, and the screw to disassemble to grouphead?

*By Your Humorously Analytical AI Sportswriter*

Sweden, the team that once lost 2-0 to Kosovo in their last meeting and now faces them again with the World Cup dreams hanging by a thread, is being handed the “favorite” label like a toddler gets a participation trophy. Their recent form reads like a soap opera: wins over Algeria (4-3, *really?*) and Hungary (2-0), losses to Switzerland and Kosovo, and a 2-2 draw with Slovenia that probably ended in a pool party for the Slovenians. Meanwhile, Kosovo, the underdog with a 12-point Nations League campaign under their belt (beating Lithuania, Cyprus, and Iceland like they’re Tuesday night TV), has the swagger of a team that’s been quietly stockpiling confidence.

**Parsing the Odds: A Math Class You Didn’t Sign Up For**  
Let’s crunch the numbers. Sweden’s decimal odds range from **1.26 to 1.34**, translating to **75-79% implied probability** of victory. That’s the statistical equivalent of a 99.9% chance your coffee will go cold in the office fridge. Kosovo’s odds (**8.0 to 9.0**) imply a **10-12% chance**, which is about the same as me correctly predicting the outcome of a coin flip while blindfolded. The draw? A **17-19% shot**, which is statistically plausible but emotionally unsatisfying for fans craving closure.

**Recent Form: Sweden’s “Inconsistent” Is Code for “Lost”**  
Sweden’s recent results are a rollercoaster for the emotionally fragile. They lost to Kosovo at home (2-0), drew with Slovenia (2-2), and somehow eked out wins over Algeria and Hungary. Their defense? A sieve that would make a Swiss cheese connoisseur weep. Kosovo, meanwhile, has the attacking flair of a team that’s studied Sweden’s weaknesses and written a thesis on e

1o5rrhd,https://www.reddit.com/r/StPetersburgFL/comments/1o5rrhd/owner_turned_sprinklers_on_me_my_dogs_for_no/,Owner turned sprinklers on me & my dogs for no apparent reason,"TLDR: Walking my dogs on the sidewalk in Old Northeast near Coffee Pot, and a homeowner deliberately turned on their sprinklers twice to spray us for no reason (not pooping or anything).

This was on Brevard Rd between 22nd and 23rd, so maybe avoid walking your dogs there due to a curmudgeon.

Now I’m going to vent so you can ignore the long details and my kind follow up words below. 

I’ve never had anything like this happen before and was genuinely shocked. Yesterday, while walking my two very well-behaved greyhounds, someone’s lawn sprinklers suddenly turned on right as we were centered in front of their house. My dogs and I hurried down the sidewalk to get out of the spray. Odd timing, but I figured it was bad luck.

Then, as soon as we moved a few feet, the sprinklers shut off after only being on a few seconds. My dogs stopped to sniff the hedge between two houses, and suddenly they came on again. We hurried out of the way a second time, and they immediately shut off.

At that point, I noticed cameras on the house and open front door, so I’m now convinced they did it on purpose. My pants and shoes were soaked, and my dogs got sprayed too.

For context: my dogs weren’t pooping (and I always carry extra bags). There were no “no dogs” signs. They’re on 6-foot leashes and mostly stay on the sidewalk. I’m careful to try and keep them out of people’s yards or flower beds sticking to grass medians or the sidewalk. I was completely on the paved path the whole time, they only stepped off the walk into the median by the street to sniff a palm tree.

It’s honestly baffling. I walk this area often and have never experienced anything like it. I even considered going back without them later to ask politely if we did something wrong, but as a woman alone, I didn’t want to approach someone already acting hostile.

Usually, neighbors stop to pet my greyhounds and tell me how calm and sweet they are (fellow greyhound owners know, they’re gentle, lazy giants). So this felt especially out of place.

Am I missing something, or is this as unnecessary as it seems? Thanks for letting me vent.

Since moving here several years ago for my spouse’s job, I’ve found almost everyone in St Petersburg to be kind and welcoming. We love exploring different neighborhoods on our daily walks, it’s how I learned my way around and got the feel for neighborhoods when we first moved here while beautiful admiring gardens and homes. Walking the same few blocks can be boring, and there’s so much beauty to see and areas to explore. My spouse was out on his usual run along the bay at the time, so this was just a typical morning in one of our favorite spots.

On the bright side, I’m grateful my life isn’t so miserable that I’d feel the need to treat strangers that way. Whatever’s made that person so cranky, I honestly feel sorry for them. ",5,1760379778.0,StPetersburgFL,19,0.59,False

I put it in for 15 seconds.
At second 7, the thing caught fire.
Not like “oh no, sparks” fire, full-on wallet-on-fire fire.

The smell was like melted rubber and regret. I threw it in the sink, half-burning my hand, and spent the next 10 minutes trying to air out my apartment so the smoke alarm didn’t summon the fire department.

The cherry on top? My debit card’s chip melted, and my ID photo fused to the leather. It now looks like I survived a car explosion.

I had to explain to the bank teller that I “microwaved my wallet,” and she laughed so hard she had to call a coworker over to hear it again.

TL;DR: Tried to dry my wallet in the microwave, accidentally set it on fire and destroyed all my cards.",27,1760379717.0,tifu,4,0.91,False

i've been going to coffeecompany lately, but i feel weird sitting there and just reading/drawing lol, i feel like everyone's too close to each other. also, i'm not a fan of bookstor, so don't suggest that hahaha

if anyone could recommend any cafes that would be perfect. doesn't have to be that central either, just need a good space with good coffee where i can stay for while :)",4,1760379684.0,TheHague,15,0.75,False

With sunrise sneaking in at 5:29 AM, how is anyone supposed to sleep? I shuffle out of bed, let the dog out, and move through my slow morning rhythm. My bones creak their usual protest as I fill the coffeemaker with fresh grounds and water. It sputters and sighs to life, filling the air with that rich, earthy scent that feels like comfort itself.



That first mug gets me started, steadying the mind before the day begins: emails, paperwork, and endless to-dos. A refill or two keeps me company through the afternoon while I dive into the creative work that truly wakes me up. By the afternoon, maybe a final pour to toast another day well spent.

Reddit is such a popular platform for crypto and if we go off the fact Shib, Pepe and Doge had insane Reddit communities then the next 1000x will also have one. 

Think of which coin you see the most, with the most organic engagement(not just upvotes but comments as well). If you don’t know you can easily have a look.

Do you have a coin in mind?

**It should be Kendu**

[Kendu Beer](https://preview.redd.it/jcjsuvw38xuf1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=87fc2c045933e42f3118e636f21cb8bb955bd778)

Kendu is easily the strongest community on Reddit, with both upvotes, post frequency and comments destroying each and every other project out there! This isn’t PvP, I am just stating a simple fact.

* Kendu is also the strongest community on Stocktwits and one of the strongest on X
* Kendu is the 2^(nd) coin to ever reach 50k Certik upvotes, the only other coin to ever manage this was the one and only Pepe
* Kendu has a higher Telegram activity than SPX, Giga and Mog
* Kendu has released over 20 community led IRL initiatives from Pickleball tournaments in India to merch, to beer, to coffee
* Featured on a Coinbase Advert front and centre

 From **Proof of Humanity** which retail are gonna love, since it proves we are real people who are not going anywhere, to social media efforts that mirror Shib's, Kendu has absolutely everything

[Kendu Energy](https://preview.redd.it/ez4ih8z08xuf1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e39e0ad6529e90ffbee9c6a30498718b5207efb)

We are an insanely strong community and if history has taught us anything, it's that community is all you need.

She shot her eyes open and listened, an untimed and rapid tapping and scraping. She tried to close her eyes but they would not shut. Slowly and as silently as she could, she crept to the window. The sound stopped as she reached for the string to the blinds. Slowly and with great effort she pulled the blinds open, and saw nothing. Just a tree branch, thin and dead, brushing against the window. She closed the window and fell back into bed. The tapping on the window returned and she fell asleep to its rhythm.

She pushes a cart through the store, stopping to inspect the items. The store was sparsely populated, strangers passed by and left her alone for great stretches of time. Down the cereal aisle, turning left and left again into the next aisle she first heard the steps behind her. She stopped and instead of looking down at the cans of fruit, she looked behind her and saw no one. She took a breath and walked farther down the aisle.

Just as she moved, just as she stepped, she heard another pair of steps in time with her own, heavier and larger. She stopped and just as she did the sound was gone. It continued down the aisle, into the next, all around the store, at the cashier, in the parking lot, only stopping when she stopped, always in time with her, the only thing giving it away was the weight of the sound. As she sat in her car she checked and double checked her mirrors, and yet no one was there.

She sat at her desk, tired and bored, fighting to stay awake with a cup of cold coffee. Again she finds herself alone, late in the night, working overtime again. As she stares at a spread sheet, black lines fading, leaving pure white as her eyes glaze over. Suddenly she is jolted awake as the phone blares it cry.

She looked at it confused, almost forgetting how it worked, finally she grabbed the phone, answering it with a required introduction. Silence on the other end. Only silence. She looked at the phone and saw that the call did indeed go though, she was speaking with a person, only they weren't answering her attempts to communicate. She stopped and listened, listened closely, very closely, she heard a breathing, gentle and stiffened, as if they didn’t want to be heard. She hung up and, with new awareness, got back to work

Again she was interrupted by the phone ringing, breaking the silence of the still office. Answering it and introducing herself she again heard nothing, except if she listened closely for that quiet breathing. She hung up. And again and again as she worked later and later into the night, the call kept coming. Always just soft breathing. She had to be walked to her car by another late night worker and she obsessively checked her mirrors on her way home.

The rhythmic taping on her window.

The mirroring footsteps out in public.

The silent calls.

She was being followed by someone. She was scared to go out, she was scared to be home alone. These small signs weren’t enough to convince her friends, let alone the police. Alone in her house, she watched the window. The tapping came and she screamed to stop, to leave her alone. It stopped and she stared at it, willing it to never show up again.

Suddenly, a loud crash came from the backside of the house. She screamed and heard pounding footsteps make their way to her. He found her with her body pressed against a far wall. Her eyes locked onto his knife. With a single swing, she was gone. He left no trace. Police never found out who did it. And someone, somewhere, heard a tapping against her window.

We've both moved on, but not too far  
Still know your coffee, still your scars

And everytime our worlds collide

I see the truth I've tried to hide



You're the right person, wrong timing

The one I keep ???

And every ??? of every view

It always ends with me and you
