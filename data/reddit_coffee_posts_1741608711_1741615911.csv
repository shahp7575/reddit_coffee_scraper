**FOOD SHOPPING**

***Vending Machines***

I want to briefly discuss vending machines - vending machines in Japan are **everywhere**, and I do mean everywhere. You'll be walking down the street and thinking ""I sure could go for a hot coffee about now"", all you have to do is turn to your right and there will probably be a vending machine right next to you serving coffee. Now, while there are all kinds of vending machines all across Japan serving just about everything you can imagine, the vast majority of the vending machines that you are going to see will be serving cold and hot beverages. Almost every machine has hot and cold beverages (hot drinks will be on a red background, cold drinks will be on a blue background) including multiple types of canned and bottled coffee, unsweetened tea, water, and sometimes energy drinks, soft drinks, Pocari Sweat (Japan's answer to Gatorade), and occasionally Chill Out (which is a beverage made to relax you).

Chances are if you're going to be walking around, you're going to be using these vending machines frequently to stay hydrated and stay caffeinated. I know people like to say don't bother with the vending machines because konbinis are cheaper, but that's just nonsense - in my experience they might be something like 10 yen cheaper for the exact same thing which is hardly worth going out of your way for. Something you do need to be aware of, however, is the lack of garbage cans which is very real. Fortunately I would say maybe 30-40% of beverage vending machines have a recycle container right next to them, so I will usually stop and finish my beverage near the vending machine so I don't have to carry around my garbage. Conversely, when you're looking for a place to throw out your beverage, try looking for vending machines as many of them will have a recycle bin.

***Convenience Stores (Konbinis)***

1. **Lawson**

2. **Daily Yamazaki**

3. Family Mart

4. 7-Eleven

5. Ministop

Let's talk about convenience stores. They are everywhere, they're cheap, and they're open 24/7. If you really wanted to, you could eat every meal of every day at the same konbini for 2 weeks and probably not eat the same thing twice. They have a selection of sandwiches, bento, pastries, onigiri, oden (when it's cold), salads, etc. But probably the thing that most tourists talk about is their fried chicken. 

Convenience store fried chicken is available all hours of the day, and it's more often than not incredibly juicy and flavorful by any standards. When you buy konbini fried chicken it's usually available in 2 forms, the regular fried chicken (boneless fried chicken patties) or karaage (which is like battered japanese style popcorn chicken). They may have multiple flavors, but typically at least they will have a spicy and a regular for each type. Having tried the fried chicken at numerous konbinis, my favorite is the fried chicken red (spicy) at Lawson, over the other options (including famichiki). It's the crispiest, it's the juiciest, and it's well seasoned. Don't get me wrong, the karaage is still good, but for some reason the texture of konbini karaage doesn't really taste quite right to me (closer to the texture of chicken mcnuggets than real chicken).

Overall, Lawson's is a very solid choice in regards to quality and selection. But outside of the fried chicken, the konbini with the best food quality out of all of them was (surprisingly) Daily Yamazaki. The sandwiches and baked goods were made with care and high quality ingredients, and they had some fantastic options available that the other chains did not have. Overall, I would put them both head and head as far as food quality goes.

Now, I'm certainly not going to list all the different things that you can get at a convenience store in Japan, there are tons of options that vary quite a bit based on the store and location. But onigiri is usually very dependable and inexpensive, egg salad sandwiches are always going to be cheap and great, and the ice cream and the baked goods (melon pan is one of my favorites) are all going to be very good. And of course you have your chuhi, beer, coffee, and just about any other beverage you might want as well.

Alright, so I've talked about the different things you should buy in a konbini, let's talk about what you shouldn't buy - pretty much anything that isn't food or drinks. Let's say it's raining and you forgot to bring an umbrella. An umbrella at a convenience store is likely going to cost you anywhere from 1000-3000 yen. Chances are there's a Daiso around the corner that sells a surprisingly good quality umbrella for 300 yen. Daiso, Seria, and Can Do (which I'll talk about shortly) are all 100 yen stores that are going to have most of your necessities for much cheaper than what you'll pay at Family Mart or Lawson.

Overall, convenience stores are a fantastic resource in Japan that will meet most of your needs. But so many also choose to use convenience stores almost exclusively for their meals, and while you certainly can do that (and it's not a bad way to go), you're still going to be missing out on all of the other great options Japan has to offer, so I would encourage you to check out my previous post, and try and explore outside your comfort zone.

***Grocery Stores***

1. AEON
2. Life Supermarket
3. Max Value
4. Seiyu
5. Ito-Yokado
6. Don Quijote

Supermarkets in Japan are probably the best and cheapest resource to find prepared foods and bento. I am not marking a favorite here and have only listed chains that are all over Japan, but there are lots and lots of supermarkets in Japan and they will usually be a great and inexpensive resource for takeout food (bentos, sushi/sashimi, pastries), in addition to any food related souvenirs you might want to bring with you. Just about anything you like to buy at a konbini, grocery stores will typically have for cheaper (and often with a much better selection). Many supermarkets in Japan are still open 24/7 as well.

Now, specifically regarding Don Quijote, Donki's selection of foods is going to be very location dependent, and I've seen many locations with a very mediocre selection of foods. Your best bet is to find a Mega Don Quijote, which will often have a much bigger selection of groceries including bento and sushi for very good prices. I'll talk more about Donki in the souvenir section, but one of the main advantages that Donki has that is that it has a tax free counter, so if you're planning on buying a lot of food souvenirs, you can often save a decent amount of money and find most of what you're looking for at a Mega Donki (hint: bring home instant Ichiran ramen, lots of it).


**SOUVENIERS**

***100 Yen Stores***

1. **Daiso**
2. Seria
3. Can Do

The 100 yen shops are a fantastic place to pick up souvenirs, especially if you're the type of personality that likes having little organizing, maintenance and cleaning solutions for everything, because Japanese culture is pretty big on attention to detail. Trying to clean your earbuds or a keyboard? They have specialized cleaning tools for both of these things. Need something to show off and organize your gachapon? Yep, they got it. You can find things like fish scalers, onigiri molds, sushi mats, gyoza makers. You can find some nice looking chopsticks, tea cups, sake cups, plates, bowls, etc. You can even find groceries there. Believe it or not I actually did about 60-70% of my souvenier shopping at Daiso, and got all kinds of interesting and useful stuff to bring with me for very cheap. 

***Cheap Clothes***

1. **Uniqlo**
2. GU

There are lots of places to buy clothes in Japan, but the big 2 are Uniqlo and GU which are both owned by the same company. Chances are even if you have a Uniqlo at home, the Uniqlo in Japan is going to be quite a bit cheaper, so if there is clothing you've been waiting to buy, buy it in Japan. The clothing is overall pretty good quality and very inexpensive. GU is a little less expensive than Uniqlo as well.

***Other Budget Picks***

1. **Standard Products**
2. **Don Quijote**
3. Tokyu Hands

There are a few other stores that have a wide variety of all kinds of goods for cheap. The most famous of which is Don Quijote which is in most neighborhoods in the major cities in Japan. I've been to so many Donki stores and they are almost always incredibly overwhelming, but they're worth experiencing. The more well known the neighborhood is, the more crowded the Donki store is going to be - it can get absolutely packed. But most of them are open 24 hours as well, and if you are avoiding peak times you should be able to find what you need. It is pretty close to one stop shopping, and they offer tax free counters as well.

Standard Goods is a small one, but a pretty cool one. It's owned by Daiso so it will usually be close to a Daiso as well. They sell pretty decent quality goods and it's a great place to pick up souveniers for cheap, but beware not everything is actually made in Japan. If you're looking for good quality knives for cheap, they offer 3 different Japanesse style knives that are made in Seki City (which is well known for high quality cutlery) for around 1000 yen each which is a great deal. They also offer high quality Japanese pencils and incense, and some various housewares. Tokyu Hands on the other hand sells pretty much everything. They're not exclusively a discount shop, more like a Target, and they have a wide variety of souveniers as well.

***Thrift Shopping***

1. **Hard Off**
2. Book Off
3. Second Street

Thrift shopping is huge in Japan, and I know some people come to Japan just to thrift shop. I am not one of these people, so I can't tell you that much about thrift stores in Japan, but from my limited understanding, the days of finding a dirt cheap Seiko watch or a high end dslr camera for dirt cheap are pretty much over (at least in Tokyo and Osaka). Shops have access to the internet, and in many cases the deals you find may not be as great as you think. The big thrift stores in Japan are * Off (Book Off, Hard Off, Off House, Mode Off, Liquor Off) and Second Street. There are lots of other independent thrift stores, and plenty of used independent electronics stores as well outside of these chains.

What I will say regarding thrift shopping is that western clothes (specifically street clothes) are huge in Japan, so you may be surprised to find a ton of American clothes (you might even be surprised to find that Orange County Little League '98 t shirt from when you were a kid at a thrift store in Tokyo). And that Japanese people tend to take very good care of their clothes, so I can see why thrift shopping is so popular in Japan. I'm sure there are some fantastic finds out there for very inexpensive.

***Gacha***

Gacha make for a great souvenier. If you're not aware of what gacha is, they are little toys that come in capsules for anywhere from 300-500 yen. They are themed, and each machine will show you the possible capsules you can get, but the actual capsule you get will be random. There are gacha for everything (food and drinks, anime characters, bands, even consumer goods), and gacha can be found everywhere you go (often unique ones) which I think make it the perfect budget souvenier. While visiting Nara you'll see deer gacha, or if you're taking the train you might seen train gacha, if you're at Sushiro they have Sushiro gacha. Sometimes you'll find massive gacha places with hundreds of machines. They're great little reminders of your trip, they're cheap, and they're fun.

If you pick up a lot of gacha on your trip and are wondering what the hell you're going to do with them, stop at Daiso or Seria, and you'll find little display cases that are specifically designed for showing your gacha (usually for 100 yen).

***Goshuin***

If you visit a lot of temples, most temples will offer handmade goshuin (stamps/seals as a proof of visit). These are sometimes free or might require a couple hundred yen, but are a great way of remembering your trip to a temple, and many make a serious hobby of collecting these goshuin. You'll need some kind of notebook and if you're on a budget you can bring your own or just buy one at a 100 yen store.

***Pictures***

Finally, in my opinion the best and cheapest of all souveniers, pictures. Remember to take lots of pictures, but at the same time, remember that lots of other people are trying to take pictures too, so be considerate. Also if you're taking photos of people, please ask their permission beforehand. At popular sites there may be a line to take a picture, don't just shove your way to the sight and get in everyone's way just for your perfect shot. Try to take the shot quickly, then move on so other people can get their perfect shot as well. Don't be that guy, nobody likes that guy.

**HOTELS**

***Cheap***

1. **Anshin Oyado**
2. Nine Hours
3. First Cabin
4. The Millenials

Let's discuss the cheapest types of hotels, capsule hotels. Yes I know hostels exist, and if you're young and broke they're great. Capsule hotels have all the cheapness of hostels, but add physical walls, and often tvs and individual air conditioning. People of all ages stay in capsule hotels in Japan because they're inexpensive and comfortable if you don't need a lot of space, just somewhere to sleep. Fortunately BO and snoring seem to be much less of an issue with capsule hotels as well, maybe because of the physical barriers.

The best out of all of these, if you can find one, is Anshin Oyado. However there's a catch - they are only located in Tokyo and Nagoya, and the locations are separated by gender. Most of the Anshin Oyado locations are men only, however there are several female only locations as well so make sure you **pay attention to the gender**. They are clean, comfortable, and have so many amenities such as all you can eat free rice (as well as several types of furikake and pickles), ayce free curry in the morning, aycd soft drinks coffee and tee, and aycd alcohol (there's an entire free bar that stays open from 5pm-2am), very nice onsens, massage chairs, free toilettries, a nice lounge. All of this for around 4000-6000 yen a night.

Nine Hours and First Cabin are also very clean and reliable, and offer lots of free toilettries. Bathrooms are shared at all of these facilities, but the bathrooms in Japan are incredibly clean, and almost always have heated seats, bidets, seat sanitizer, and even ""bathroom shoes"" you can wear.

***Cheapish***

1. **Super Hotel**
2. Toyoko Inn
3. Henn Na
4. Hotel Livemax
5. APA Hotel

If you're looking for a full room, most people sooner or later end up looking at APA. Personally I think there are many reasons not to stay in an APA hotel (the owner pretty much sucks, the rooms are small and cramped and sometimes have cleanliness issues, they are often very crowded and sometimes noisy) when there are lots of other alternatives around the same price point. If you can, go for a uper Hotel or a Toyoko Inn, both of which offer free breakfast, and Super Hotel can sometimes have onsens and free alcohol during happy hour. Personally I think they're a bit friendlier and a bit nicer to stay at, and I'd rather support them than APA.

***Cheap Splurge***

1. **Dormy Inn**

I had a sudden change of plans when I got sick in Japan, so I ended up staying at a Dormy Inn and boy was I glad that I did. These are a bit pricier, usually about 10,000-15,000 yen a night. I liked it so much I ended up staying at another one and had an equally good experience. They often have very, very nice onsens, very comfortable beds with snacks waiting for you, delicious breakfast. The TV's even have music that relaxes you and helps you sleep. If you have a bit extra and you want to splurge for a night, can't recommend Dormy Inn enough.

***Internet Cafes***

1. **Kaikatsu Club**
2. Gran Cyber Cafe
3. Media Cafe Popeye
4. Kintaro

Now we're getting into the really cheap territory. I knew all about the internet cafes before I came to Japan, but I was really intimidated by them. I knew it was mostly locals that visited them and I wasn't sure whether or not I'd be welcome, and I didn't really like not having my plans booked in advance, so I didn't try one out until late in my trip. But boy, do I regret not trying going to one earlier. So much so that I might even stay entirely in internet cafes on my next trip to Japan.

Kaikatsu Club is the big internet cafe chain, and I will tell you that internet cafes in Japan are nothing like internet cafes in other places. Not only are they open 24/7, but you get your own private space and in many cases your own private room where you can lay down, relax, watch Netflix or play games, and go to sleep. And you can usually do all this for much cheaper than even a capsule hotel or hostel.

I should mention that prices and availability are going to vary a lot by location. Don't expect that a Kaikatsu Club right outside Shibuya Scramble will be all that cheap on a Saturday night (or even available, it's probably pretty busy). But if you can find locations that are a little further out, you can usually spend 8-12 hours there and sleep there for around 3000 yen or even less depending on the location.

And they all have blankets, clean showers and bathrooms, laundry rooms, and all you can drink soft drinks, coffee, and soup, as well as all you can eat ice cream. You can also leave your room anytime to stop at the konbini and bring the food back. Most locations that have private rooms will allow you to bring the food back to the room, however if it's just a booth you may need to eat in the kitchen area.

It's cheap, clean, and comfortable, and I had a great time. You will need to get a membership card at the front desk which is free, and once you receive your membership card, you simply check in and pick the type of booth/room you want using the self service machine (which is available in English). Just make sure you select a room with a futon and not a chair if you plan on sleeping there.

It's also a great way to get a nap in if you need it, or just kill a few hours while you're waiting to check into your hotel (and it's a great place to get your laundry done as well). I now wish I would have made much more use of the internet cafes on my trip, and will be taking advantage on my next one.

1j7z7u8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1j7z7u8/unbearable_mil/,Unbearable MIL,"Hi everyone, I can't be rude to my MIL so I'm just here to vent. English is not my first language so I'm sorry in advance for my mistakes.
Some background: 
My husband (m32) and I (f29) are together for 13 years, married for 2 and are happy together. We live close to our families. 
MIL and I are not close but civil, mostly because I'm nice. She doesn't like that I'm a daughter of immigrants, like I can control that, although my parents are wealthy, self-maid, and helped us tremendously. She comments about my weight (l'm average), she tries to make me feel bad for having a carrier.
We own our home (we were living with my amazing parents while it was being built for 3 years for free and they helped us pay the deposit on this house, my husband's father also helped us financially with the deposit). 
My husband's parents divorced when he was 4, for many years his parents were on good terms (although MIL would talk shit about him constantly in from of my husband) but since our wedding my FIL cut any contact with MIL (rightfully so, but that's another story). 
MIL doesn't have any family, friends, colleagues, acquaintances accept my husband, basically he is the only person she talks to regularly.

Now for what happened few days ago that left me LIVID:
She came to see my husband at our house, door opens, she looks in and then looks at me and says : ""oh!! it's not  as messy and dirty here, unlike last time"" then she goes to our garden, looking at it and again looking at me ""do you like how it looks?"", I am already upset at this point although it's been a minute since she entered and reply ""yes, I think it's perfect"". She nods and say ""As long as you like it..."". At this point I rush to take our dog to a vet appointment and leave.
I came back like 30 minutes later, as I open the door I see my husband making her coffee while she is ripping leaves and ""fixing"" our garden. I ask him ""what is your mother doing?"", he then notice and run out to ask her to stop immediately. She comes back in and says unapologetically ""those brown leaves really bother me, at my house I take it out immediately"" then I replied ""this was perfect in my opinion, no need to change anything here"".
I left to the grocery store right after that.
When I came back she wasn't there, I told my husband she needs boundaries. They had this conversation many times before and she dismissed him and making him the villin who argues and insultes her.
Suggestions on how to approach this reacoring issues would be appreciated, going NC is not an option. He sees her once a week, I see her 6-9 times a year.",1,1741615087.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

Sargeant Esteban Rodriguez was sipping his morning coffee, browsing through yet another report on the current inventory. Shortage of materials could mean life or death in deep space, and he’d be damned if he would let that happen on his watch.

Looking up from his tablet, there was P’targh. Out of uniform. Holding it in his upper hands, looking like he just broke something valuable.

Rodriguez arched an eyebrow. “Why are you not in uniform?”

P’targh hesitated “It… Um…”

“Spit it out. Got no time for hemming and hawing.”

“It doesn’t fit.”

“How?”

“No holes.” P’targh let his lower arms drop to his sides.

Rodriguez set his coffee down with a sigh. “Then get it altered.”

P’targh blinked. “I… Can do that?”

Rodriguez gave him a flat look. “You think we expected you to cut off two arms?”

P’targh’s ears burned.

Rodriguez exhaled through his nose. “Take it to requisitions. Get it sorted.”

P’targh clutched the uniform tight to his body. “Yes, sir.”

Rodriguez went back to his coffee as P’targh hurried out with a determined step.

The rest of the day passed uneventfully.

That evening, however, P’targh’s door chime rang. Again. He had a feeling this was gonna become a thing.

Standing there, grinning from ear to ear, was Jake Weisz. “C’mon, we’re going.”

“Going where?”

“You’ll see.”

Jake led him through the ship, all the way to the rec room. “This,” Jake announced, “is where we unwind.”

P’targh was confused. “Unwind?”

“Unwind. Chill, relax, have fun. You do know how to have fun, right?”

“Um, I usually spend the time in my quarters. My gyroscope bed is quite – ”

“Yeah, so it’s kind of like that, but with games.”

“Games?” P’targh knew the concept, but even if he could find a game partner before, nobody would ever play with him.

“Yep. Check it out – the latest in deep space entertainment: *Velocity: Eclipse*.”

P’targh looked at the screen, a star field expanded in front of him, cockpit outlines glowing in the edges.

“What is it?”

“Just a game,” Jake said casually. “You fly around, dodge some rocks, maybe blow up a few pirates. Good fun. Let me show you.”

Jake dropped into the seat, started the game up, swerved left, made a loop, crashed into an asteroid.

“OK, so I’m not great,” Jake admitted, “but I have fun, Now let’s see what you got.”

P’targh hesitated. “I do not fly ships.”

“Dude, it’s not real. Just try it.”

Reluctantly, P’targh slid in the seat. The controls felt awkward in his hands “I don’t know how –”

“Yeah, yeah, that’s what I’m here for,” Jake cut in. “So, this is your pitch, yaw’s here, roll’s there, throttle here. Got it?”

P’targh nodded hesitantly, then gripped the controls. The mission began.

It was a disaster. Jerky movements, oversteering, nearly smashing into an asteroid – twice.

Then, something clicked.

His lower hands twitched, instinctively reaching for secondary controls. He adjusted his grip, mapping his four hands to different functions. The awkward jerks stopped. The ship weaved between obstacles, moving in ways the controls weren’t designed for – but it worked. Suddenly, the tutorial mission was over.

“That’s it?” P’targh asked.

Jake smirked. “That was just the warm-up. Now you get your first enemy.”

The next level loaded: atmospheric combat. Blue sky, rolling canyons below.

“Alright, this time, watch your altitude,” Jake instructed. “That’s your altimeter, keep it above zero. And these –“ he pointed at the interface “– are your weapons and countermeasures. Shoot the enemy with weapons, deal with their weapons with countermeasures.”

P’targh spotted the enemy fighter, instinctively rolling to avoid fire. He dove into a canyon, skimmed the edge of a cliffside, then abruptly cut the engines.

The enemy shot past him.

P’targh restarted the engines and blasted the bogey out of the sky.

MISSION SUCCESS.

Jake stared at the screen. “Okay… what the hell was that?”

P’targh tilted his head. ”I stopped moving. They did not expect it.”

Jake’s eyes narrowed. “You sure you’ve never played this before?”

“Positive.”

P’targh looked at Jake with a blank expression on his face.

Jake exhaled slowly.

“Well, damn.”

P’targh spent the next few days in janitorial duties and evening gaming sessions, finding a surprising enjoyment in the human entertainment. Sarge steadily expanded his access privileges as well, making P’targh proud of himself.

“Loma!” Sarge’s voice echoed through the Mess Hall. “Report to Chief Engineer Zhao in Engineering! Urgent clogged vent!”

P’targh hurried to Engineering, eager to finally see the ship’s engines. Chief Engineer Laura Zhao, impeccably uniformed, met him with a weary look.

“Port thruster vent’s clogged. Diagnostic, recalibration, three different solvent mixtures – nothing works. We’re dead in space in the next 24 hours.”

“Where did this start?” P’targh asked. Zhao pulled up a chart, and showed P’targh the coordinates within a nebula.

“Tarsen gas. Turns to oil at higher temperatures.”

Zhao looked incredulously. “That shouldn’t be possible.”

“Seen it happen before,” P’targh replied. “You need Carbex. mixed with coolant. It’ll break the oil.”

“Carbex? A degreaser?”

“Or disassemble the thing,” P’targh shrugged.

“That would take days.” Determination flashed in the engineer’s eyes. “Desperate times. Let’s do it your way. The access duct is still too small for any human to approach, though.”

“On it.” P’targh crawled into the cramped space, deftly scraping and cleaning the buildup. He emerged to Zhao’s confirmation. “Everything’s working. We’ll add Carbex to our procedures. Thank you, P’targh. We couldn’t have fixed this.”

Finally, Sarge gave him a new assignment – the Bridge. He hesitated. Sarge said, “Problem?”

P’targh twitched. “I… Don’t usually go to places like that.”

“You go where I send you.”

The Bridge. The hub of the ship. Nobody paid him any mind. But he felt honored to just be there. And he never realized it up until this point, but officers were slobs. He could see why he was sent here. Starting work, everything was fine – until he heard his name. “P’targh.”

Turning around, Captain Vukov stood near the central console, her sharp eyes fixed on him. P’targh straightened up.

“You can read Xanthian star maps, correct?”

A murmur spread across the Bridge. Unlike human star charts, the Xanthian maps the *Advance* acquired were three-dimensional knots of shifting points, distances mapped in gravity rather than light-years. Nobody on the Bridge could make heads nor tails of them.

“I… Yes, I can read them.”

Vukov gestured for him to come closer, then showed him the holographic display. “What am I looking at here?”

P’targh scanned the shifting data, made a couple keystrokes, the chart reoriented into something that actually made some sense.

“That’s the Tenebris Drift. A dense nebula, rich in minerals, hard to navigate.”

His fingers moved again. “Here. A minor trading outpost. Ephrasis IV.”

Vukov showed to a spot. “If I’m reading this correctly, our current route leads us through here.”

“That’s a death trap.”

The crew fell silent.

P’targh swallowed. “This star,” he pointed to a massive red giant at the edge of the chart, “is collapsing. It’s feeding a black hole here.” His hand moved to the spot the route would take them through. “Gravitational distortions are unpredictable. Tidal forces will tear us apart.”

“Long range sensors, stat!” Captain exclaimed.

“High gravity field detected, ma’am, but well within parameters. Expanding sensors to maximum… P’targh’s claim confirmed.”

Captain Vukov exhaled, rubbing her temple. “I should’ve caught that,” she admitted honestly. “I don’t have the experience with alien star charts that you clearly do.”

She looked at P’targh, weighing something in her mind.

“Your janitorial duties can wait. You know your way around maps, and I need a navigator. Consider yourself provisionally assigned to the bridge.”

P’targh’s secondary arms twitched in surprise.

“I – You want me to – ?”

The Captain looked at him. “You’d rather be scrubbing cargo holds?”

P’targh straightened. “No, sir! Uh, Captain! Uh… Ma’am.”

With a slight smile on her face, Captain Vukov nodded. “Then take a seat. You have work to do.”",2,1741614741.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

This is a long story and take ur time if u r interested.


I (23M) and (18F). Is this relationship consider as friends with benefits?

I met her at the my friends birthday but i actually started to know and communicate her in FB. We chatted for about 2 months or less, I asked her for a date but she refused due to her schedule. After sometime, she change her mind and agreed for a date. That time, it was already past 7, when she arrived. Due to her age and weren't still know to each other, its better to go for coffee date because its already night. At that time, we just telling stories and etc. At some point, she started to say that we should go to my condo but i refused becuase its boring.

After our coffee was finished. On our way, she said that his cousin have visitor(cousin's bf) and she doesn't want to go home yet so he wants to stay at my condo to rest first and I agreed.

When we arrive shes already sleepy. I insisted to use the bed and she agreed. While she was resting, I took a bath first and prepared my other blanket to sleep in the floor. She saw i was already resting their and invited me to get in the bed because there are still enough space. When I got there, we already have separate blanket. 

At that time, she started to move closer to me and use my hand as a pillow. That time i just go with the flow. Until, she started to tickle me and I also tickle her but not enough.

At some point, she tickled me and i hold his both hand while under her. Supposedly, I was going to tickle her with my chin but as soon as i tried she suddenly kissed me. Instinctively, i also kissed her until we used our tongues. Honestly, my mind went blank and i started kissing and licking his shoulder, ears, breast, neck and tried to went to his p*ssy but she pulled me. When I tried to penetrate her ""she whisper to slow down"" and I complied. Due to my inexperience our sex was lasted only for 4-5 mins. 

After that, we just laid down quietly for a minute after we started to put some clothes on.  Then we cudlle after and back to tickling again. When she started to say that she will going back to her cousin after a few  minute and i should do anything before she leaves. I was quite that time because i didn't know what she really meant. 

At 11pm, I insisted to go with her for safety reasons. Before we departed at his cousin, she suddenly hug me and i just kissed his forehead.

When i got home, my mind was overwhelmed to that point that i only sleep for 2 hours.

At the morning, while cleaningy bedsheets and blanket i happen to saw blood and asked her if she were ok and well but happily shes fine.
 
I dont know if that was his first and  To be honest that was my also my first kiss, s*x and everything. I cant really forget that feeling. So i tried to invite her again at my condo and she agreed. 

She came to my condo on her own after some hour past. We just laid there cuddling and playing some music. Until, i tried to kiss her and we had s*x again. After a few minute we started to have sex again but longer and i felt that she also have an orgasm. 

On the afternoon, she went to their hometown.

ON 3 WEEKS INTERVAL

I chatted with her with some greetings, flirty line and etc. and shes ok with this.

I was really curious about our relationship and tried to ask her if she can accept me as her bf but
At some point, she asked me ""if there will be a time that I will be tired of her?"",""I dont want to be left again""I replied all that kind of questions. 

She replied that I should wait first.

But until now we have casual relationship but were not on a relationship like bf/gf.

Whats ur though about this?

Never have been, never will be. I am one of those ""don't talk to me until I have my coffee"" people except it's more like don't talk to me until 10am AND have had my coffee and maaaaybe I can be barely civil .    
      
My husband fancies himself a morning person. Won't shut up about how much I struggle every morning. And yet who is the one who has dragged themselves out of bed 95% mornings to get up with the kids since having them? Who is getting the kids ready for school and that everyone has what they need for the day despite barely being able to string together a thought? Me. Of course it's always fucking me, while husbands gets to ease into the morning at his pace all while loudly pointing out how ""out of it"" I am .    
     
It pisses me off so much. Despite the time change my son is up by 6. I am woken up against my will with my stomach hurting from anxiety so coffee is out of the question and I'm already having a bad time. Husband actually got up first and me, an idiot, thought that meant I could stay in bed. Except every time he gets up first he makes fucking pancakes. I love a good pancake but not when he makes them first thing in the morning. It somehow wipes out the entire kitchen first thing after I cleaned it up last night and you know it's going to *me* that is going to have to clean it all up. And it's the morning of my big Costco run and nothing pisses me off more than a wiped out kitchen and having nowhere to put stuff up on bringing it all in from the far. It's too difficult to eat pancakes in bed so I have to go eat in the dining room with everyone which is just too freaking much in the morning for me. My teen is the same way I am on the mornings so we are both struggling and husband will make more annoying comments about how hard it is to watch us on the morning. I have an extremely dry mouth in the morning and I feel like I'm choking down these pancakes no matter how much syrup I put on them. So yeah, fuck weekday morning pancakes.    
      
And as soon as I try to get back in bed my son brings out his Lego train set. And as soon as my husband disappears into the shower my son of course struggles with everything about it and requires my constant help and attention. Getting the tracks snapped together. Getting the train lined up on the track right. Random pieces falling off. The robot vacuum deciding to run directly into the train set and wrecking shit up.  I just don't have the patience or the mental capacity to deal with any of it yet and I lose my shit way too easily.    
       
 And as soon as I get son happy playing somewhat independently and I lay back down to enjoy some sweet silence my husband is out of the shower and immediately talking at me and asking questions and saying that he's sorry that my son won't let me sleep in and I'm fighting the urge to snap back that I shouldn't have to get out of bed if husband is such a cheerful fucking morning person. He knows how much I hate mornings and apparently hates the way I am in the morning so why hasn't it occured to him to take care of everything in the morning and leave me the fuck alone. But that would start a fight for sure and I just don't want to deal with a mantrum on top of everything else. He already got all pissy with me because I got annoyed with the robot vacuum.   
       
Anyway. Fuck mornings and men who make mornings harder.

Cigarettes were managing my ADHD symptoms. Cant smoke anymore. Meds alone are not cutting it and I am a mess. Tried everything I can think of but I miss how well meds + cigarettes managed my ADHD and mood. Looking for advice from anyone who has experienced this.



I started smoking in 7th grade (20 years ago). I quit a few times over the years, the longest quits being through pregnancy & nursing so not a good gauge of emotional regulation and focus. End of 2021 I was finally diagnosed with ADHD after decades of struggling & depression, anxiety, low self-worth. When I started medication I felt like everything finally made sense and I was able to live like a 'normal' person for awhile. Work was going well, my house was consistently tidy, I was exercising regularly, cooking healthy meals, etc, etc, etc. Finally, I decided it was time to quit smoking and for the first time in my life it was fairly easy. Except that everything else fell apart almost immediately. I am now >2 years smoke free and I am miserable. I have tried NRT, different meds, different dosages, CBT, anti-depressants, exercising more. Nothing helps me with my moods or focus the way the combo of smoking + vyvanse did. Looking back it feels like cigarettes (pre vyv) did more for me than the vyv is doing now without the cigarettes. But the combo of both was like a miracle. I was able to experience so many things I hadnt before like joy, and hope, and focus. I had no intrusive thoughts, or depression, or crippling RSD for the first time in my life. And now that I know what is possible, being back to this feels worse than ever.

It is having a real and significant impact on my life. To the point where I just want to say screw it and start smoking again. Better to have a few years of good mental health than a long life of physical health. Except that my physical health is already declining due to my mental health anyway. I cant really afford to smoke though. Plus I am already very close to the age my mother was when she died from smoking related cancers which is not very old. I have children who need me to be around. Except I dont feel like I am much use to them currently anyways. 

So what do I do? Has anyone experienced this? Coffee doesnt seem to help, at least not enough. My pop consumption increased when I quit smoking because of cravings but that caffeine doesnt compensate for the nicotine. I dont have any other vices. Please help. ",1,1741613915.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

*""You read something which you thought only happened to you, and you discover that it happened 100 years ago to Dostoevsky. This is a very great liberation for the suffering, struggling person, who always thinks that he is alone. This is why art is important""*

*-James Baldwin*

Sonder is a word from the Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows, and this is their definition:

*“Sonder*

*n. the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own—populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness—an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you’ll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk.”*

We are each of us alone in the cavern of our own skull. We can try to explain ourselves to each other in words, but in the end I’ll never know how it feels to be you, and you’ll never know how it feels to be me, no matter how much empathy we might have for each other. It’s a lonely feeling. I keep thinking about the AIDS quilt. If you haven't ever looked at it before, you can find it [here](https://www.aidsmemorial.org/interactive-aids-quilt). It is the most perfect representation of the word “Sonder” that I have ever found.

The other thing I’ve been thinking about a lot lately is the tendency of people to treat others as NPCs in their own personal video game. It’s obviously not a new thing for humans to do, but with the rise of AI writing and AI art, I see more and more people online accusing each other of not being real in a whole new scary way. I’ve seen the most arbitrary criteria levied against posts to “prove” that they were made by AI. Of course AI generated stuff does exist, but I don’t think people are as good at spotting it as they think they are. I feel like the default position should be kindness, rather than flailing around to prove that everyone else is a robot except for you. So that’s why I decided to start this project.

Whenever I’m stuck in an art rut, I like to draw weird little faces. I have over 100 now, and I’ve just been keeping them in an origami box and not doing anything with them. But I think maybe this could be a good way to begin to start to represent a tiny piece of the enormity of the idea that is sonder. I asked my friends to choose a face and think of one thing they would want to tell the world about themselves, and I started to make these tiny books that you see in the photographs, each one unique and representing the entirety of a life, the same way the AIDS quilt does. Since I already have so many drawings, I thought I’d start collecting words from people on the internet. So if you would like to participate, please either comment here, DM me, or comment on the Youtube video linked at the top of the post with the following:

* Your first name (it doesn’t have to be your real name, but you should pick a name that you feel represents you)
* What you would like me to write inside the card. The way I think of it is, if I had one chance to tell the world something about my existence, what would I say?
* If you like, you can choose a specific face ,or I can just pick one for you.
* Since this is the Inscryption subreddit, you can also tell me which sigil you'd want on your card, and I'll draw it on the back :P

The change of scenery, the ambient café noise, and, of course, the amazing coffee made this one of my most productive days in a while.

As a coffee person, I found the experience even better. The aroma, the occasional hustle and bustle, and the warm lighting helped me stay focused for longer than usual. I was in the zone, and my deep work sessions felt effortless. I also enjoyed the subtle social aspect—just enough interaction to not feel isolated but not so much that it became a distraction.

This made me realize that I need to incorporate more café workdays into my routine. Sometimes, stepping out of the home office is all it takes to refresh your mind and boost productivity. If you're feeling stuck or sluggish, I highly recommend trying it out!

1j7ynqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1j7ynqj/broke_up_with_crazy_cheating_ex/,Broke up with crazy cheating ex,"
This is my first relationship with a girl who suffers from BPD, and its been an emotional rollercoaster over the last 9 months. My girlfriend who I met on Bumble we started dating in May of 2024. The beginning was amazing, i’ve never had a connection with someone like this on a dating app before, it felt like the strongest connection. Our first date she asked alot of questions and after she tried to kiss me when I hugged her, and I thought she got offended I didn’t kiss her. 

After that things picked up, I asked for a second date and after that we were in a relationship a month later. I met her family and friends, but I had this gut feeling something wasn’t right about her, its too good to be true. I noticed anytime we hangout her phone was on DND, and occasionally face down. I could never hold her phone or look at it. She maintained a high presence on social media and I could tell craved external validation. I was also told by her she just had depression. One night at dinner she was arguing with her sister and her eyes were black and empty, souless eyes. I never seen those before but I was terrified, I later foundout she dissociates all the time.

Our relationship was focused highly around sex. She had a huge sex drive and always wanted sex or talked sexually. Used sex as a weapon when she was mad or used it to get what she wants. She always hated protection. 

She mentioned a few times she wanted to get off her medication for depression, subtle things she would say. Again, I still felt something was off with her, she was rushing to get into a relationship. I remember asking about her ex and she talked badly about him, saying he never paid for anything and she withheld sex from him. She mentioned her first ex was abusive and never really explained why but he was controlling. All previous ex’s were controlling, crazy, or always wanted to see where she was at. She sat me down one day after dinner asking if women talk to me and do I talk to other women? I told her im loyal and thats not something to worry about, she then pretended she was a girl and started talking to me to see how’d I respond.

I didn’t want to be that ex or controlling but one day at a party she was hanging out with me and she opened a Snapchat from a guy right next to me, a guy she continuously talks to. I told her I don’t like that at all, which she was anxious about my response. I noticed guys would constantly Snapchat her and I’d confront her about it, yet she would blatantly lie saying its her friend who’s a girl. 

She would repeatedly tell me she’s walking on eggshells but I would explain that Im not allowed to talk to other women but its okay for you to talk to other men? She mentioned if this keeps happening she will “self sabatoge badly.” Not sure what that meant. 

After this, when I’d walk into the room, she’d put her phone down immediately when I’d walk in. If I asked to see her phone, she mentioned all trust would be lost. Even sharing locations, she shares it with all her friends, family, but not me, even with her ex when they were together. She told me “you’re fighting my trust.” I was cheated on once that I explained to her, so her behavior was making me anxious. When hanging out, i’d see her addictively messaging someone on Snapchat behind her water bottle or between her legs, or under her arm. Her behavior was extremely childish, she wasn’t good at hiding anything.

I’d send her a message at dinner and her phone screen wouldn’t activate so her notifications were turned off. It turns out after 9 months she cheated on me with her ex and a guy she was seeing when she met me, as a form of revenge. For some reason, if someone is controlling to her or asserts boundaries she self sabatoges out of anger and spite, which she did. I never fully understood this aspect of BPD. 

She lied about having BPD and mentioned to me one night at dinner that she has it, and takes alot of medications for it. She lied constantly about seeing her ex, while having bruises all over her inner thighs and thighs, her butt, and all over her vagina from cheating. Claiming its from “me” and when asked about the bruises she goes I bruise all the time, and “you see how you don’t trust me.” She had dark finger pad bruises all over, even one day she wouldn’t take her pants off in front of me because of then. She would cry and say the bruises are from her “anemia” including bruises on her hips from her jeans. One day she accused me of cheating out the blue while getting coffee, so I called her out on it for projecting and she changed what she said and goes that never happened I said “I know you’d never cheat on me.” 

I’ve never been cheated on this badly, to hide the bruises she would claim she got her period right before sex. She would wear my favorite underwear on her before sex but said I got my period and wouldn’t take them off. For months we would eat dinner and i’d pay, do everything for her, and she would sit at the table without an ounce of remorse. She continued to lie and gaslight, even to the point I would call her out for being lying and cheating, yet she’d claim “im abusive.” 

Everytime I’d call her out on the bruises, sometimes full blown handprints, she would get all scared and walk over and kiss my shoulder, like a sad child. Everything was a facade and a lie, she had an extremely high body count and brought many guys home to the family but it never worked out.

Whats crazy is she posts on social media after our breakup about how loyal she is and religious, although behind closed doors shes a horrible human being. She’s clinging hard to protect her reputation after I went no contact, but does anyone believe this is typical for BPD behavior? The double standard was absurd, she would constantly want to see my phone or hated women talking to me. 

Before we broke up after she got caught cheating and still denied it. She mentioned she doesn’t feel romantic and wants a relationship where a “guy would throw her up on the kitchen counter and have sex with her.” And mentioned she wanted games like sex roulette and sex jenga, anything spontaneous about sex.


I wanted to list other behaviors
-extremely sensitive to rejection
-zero accountability 
-blame shift and gaslight (she knew all these terms)
-Self loathing and negative self talk
-extremely low self esteem 
-couldn’t sit with her own thoughts, constant distractions 
-extreme highs and lows
-horrible grudges one day, the next day shes loving
-pathalogical lying
-hypersexual 
-dissociation 
-empty eyes

Like it says in the title, I’m hoping to find people to talk to during the day. It can get quiet and lonesome, and I love getting to know new and interesting people!

By no means do you have to be Jewish, I just put that in there since I live in an area with few other Jews, so it’s nice to connect with other members of the tribe. Happy to talk to people who are curious about it too, but I am by no means an expert. 

I’m a nerd in general , so feel free to talk nerdy to me, but my interests are broad and I can get into anything anyone else is passionate about. Science, philosophy, creative writing, gaming, working out, photography, cooking, F1 - these are all on the table to name just a few. 

I’m the kind of guy that savours his morning coffee, likes to do the crossword or wordle between sips, and enjoys those quiet moments. It would be nice to share those moments with another person. 

I am a fan of playful banter, shameless flirting and being an all around degenerate, but that’s not the main goal of this post. I am open to seeing where things go, but let’s take it slow, okay?

Interested in making friends with anyone, and open to more depending on how we vibe. Tell me how you like your coffee (or tea), or the last meal you made that you were proud of! Feel free to use chats or messages. Hope to hear from some of you soon!

1) My fiancé (bi/F) and I had a mutual friend that I’ve known for years before ever meeting my fiancé. This friend knew that my divorce was caused due to lies and cheating by my ex wife. This friend was not happy my fiancé and I got together. Even going so far to say things about my past she didn’t have first hand knowledge of to try to dissuade my fiancé from dating me. I just recently found out my finance hooked up with this friend and friends husband before we knew each other. That’s in the past no big deal. When they had coffee after we got together, this friend kissed her (not a friend kiss) and tried to insinuate more could happen with them. 

AITA for being upset and bothered someone I considered a friend would go so far to disrespect that we are in a relationship? WIBTA to say I don’t want them to hangout or talk anymore?

2) Fiancé has a close long time friend (female) from a few states away. This friend when we made it public when we made our relationship public “cry” reacted the post. Had on her public profile as “fiancés girl”. I have never had any interactions with this friend. Recently found out this person has blocked me. I can only assume it’s so they don’t see the posts of my fiancé and I together. My fiancé promises nothing has ever gone on between them. They have only ever hung out in real life twice. Once before we met and just this past December when she came to visit. 

AITA for being bothered by this? WIBTA to say how uncomfortable it makes me? That someone would go so far to be so envious to not be happy for their friend and block me? Just seems like there’s something going on there like envy and not the kind of person I would want staying in my house if she came to visit, or my fiancé going to see.

I thought it’d be easy, go to a few showrooms, sit on them and maybe lie down, pick one and be done. But the first store I went to the salesman just started explaining things and I soon realized I had no clue about anything. And he quoted my 12k for the one I liked so that was an instant nope out. 

I’ve spent the last few days just looking up sofas, what to look for and what to avoid, things like frame materials, hardwood vs. metal frames, cushion densities and everything, and I still feel so unsure about everything

This should be easy for me, considering I do interior design. my own place is a two-bedroom rental in LA, nothing fancy but it’s got decent light, and I’ve made it work. 

My current sofa is trash. I got it at an outlet sale years ago, and at the time, I thought I got a great deal. It looked nice, the price was good, and I figured, hey, how bad could it be. I got my answer soon enough though, and it wasn’t good. It is bad

I don’t have excess space to waste so I’ve decided on a custom size to make the most of what I have. Besides, since I’m gonna be dropping a fair sum, I want it to be as perfect as possible. The right dimensions, fabric, firmness, and color. The problem is, every brand claims they’re the best, and I don’t know what’s legit or just marketing. I checked one that said they did custom but it was just a few pre set sizes in different fabrics. I thought custom meant picking out my own details in their design? I know I cant really expect a bespoke sofa at my price point (around 4k) but I think it’s fair to expect more freedom of options. If I wanted mass manufactured stuff I’d just buy IKEA

Design wise, I’m looking for something with a clean, modern look that isn’t too chunky or flimsy. I love a low profile, structured silhouette, but nothing that looks like it belongs in a waiting room. Comfort is ofc the highest priority, pretty much non negotiable. 

I’m still not sure about cushion densities/softness but Id like soft ones, which can still hold up over time. And for fabric, something resistant to stains, and which won’t keep hair stuck on it. Some wine and coffee spills are also bound to happen eventually, so spills should be easily manageable. And I’m on the shorter side so can’t raelly deal with too deep a sofa. Makes me feel small like a toddler when my legs cant reach the floor cus I’m forced to sit too far back

  
**What I’ve looked at so far**: 

Maiden Home. looked nice, but I’ve seen so many mixed reviews. Some people love them, some say the quality is meh for the price. 

Interior Define. Liked theirs, but they’ve had customer service issues, and I’m not a fan of fighting chatbots if something goes wrong. 

West Elm, CB2, Restoration Hardware were next on my list but got turned off by their pricing  
I could use any help honestly, god knows I need it. Sorry for the rambling ",1,1741613103.0,interiordecorating,2,0.67,False
1j7yiyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CAStateWorkers/comments/1j7yiyl/chatgpts_analysis_of_rto/,ChatGPT’s analysis of RTO,"The estimated cost difference between a four-day in-office workweek versus a two-day in-office workweek for California state employees depends on several factors, including commuting expenses, parking, meals, and productivity losses. Let’s break it down with some assumptions and calculations:

1. Commuting Costs
The average round-trip commute for California state employees is 20–30 miles per day.
The average cost of driving (gas, maintenance, wear and tear) is about $0.66 per mile (based on IRS mileage rates).
Public transportation costs range from $5–$15 per day, depending on location.

Studies show that remote workers are 5–15% more productive than in-office workers.
An extra two days in-office per week could result in a 2–6% productivity loss.
Estimated Economic Impact
If a state employee earns $75,000 annually, a 2–6% productivity loss equates to $1,500–$4,500 in lost productivity per employee.

Conclusion
Mandating four days in the office instead of two days could cost each employee an extra $4,430–$10,198 per year when accounting for commuting, parking, meals, and productivity losses. Given that California employs over 200,000 state workers, the total economic impact could range from $886 million to $2 billion annually.
These costs highlight the financial burden on employees and potential losses in productivity that could arise from Newsom’s return-to-office mandate.

I’m a 30 year old guy living in the UK, looking to make some real-life friends to hang out with. Whether it’s grabbing a coffee, going for pints, or just enjoying some good food, I’m always up for a good time and good conversation.

I recently moved and don’t have many friends outside of work, so I’d love to meet some like-minded people. I’m originally Turkish and always happy to connect with new folks.

A little about me: I’m currently studying for my third degree in criminology (hoping to become a police detective in a few years) and working as a bartender. I enjoy singing, playing guitar, driving around, and gaming. I’m into movies, music, science, and all sorts of interesting topics, so I’m always up for a deep chat or just having a laugh.

I’d love to exchange Instagram if you’re up for it. After all, no one wants to meet in person with a complete anonymous. Feel free to dm!

1j7yi0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1j7yi0t/how_its_like_to_never_have_been_loved/,How it's like to never have been loved,"I don’t know why I’m writing this. Perhaps it’s because I want to let it out, perhaps because I want to be seen, felt and understood. Perhaps because there are people out there who may have been in my shoes and am curious to know how they moved on from that.

I’m a Middle Eastern, gay 39 year old man, who remained a virgin until the age of 37, mostly for cultural and religious reasons related to fear, shame and guilt. I don’t consider myself attractive per se from the outside, but I highly value and love my personality. I know am a good person, and a lot of my friends have told me that over the years.

Throughout my life, I’ve loved more than 12 men, some straight and the others gay/bi. All of them never loved me back, and some of them never knew I had feelings for them. When I decided to join dating apps, as they’re the only way to meet people in my country which illegalizes gay bars/clubs and any outdoor gathering, I was elated to see so many people on the apps. It seemed like a pool with a lot of potential people to get to know. I wanted to heal from my heartache over the years, of giving love but never receiving any. 

I started hooking up with guys in hopes of gaining sexual experience which was important to me. Those hookups scarred me more than I could have ever imagined. Not once have I ever been rimmed nor sucked, despite me asking clearly for those things and promised they would happen. It left me feeling deeply hurt after each time, as if I was some piece of meat that no one wanted to approach. This also happened after I had started going to the gym for over a year, and had improved my looks substantially. I still am overweight, but looking at all the guys of all shapes and sizes who get pleasure in bed has left me wondering why am never getting any. It was like I was merely there to service my sexual partner - with my own pleasure repeatedly denied.

What is it like to never have been loved (romantically nor sexually)? I was never asked that question, but I know the answer. At first, you start wondering whether there is something wrong with you. Next, it makes you feel emotionally and physically disabled in some sense, that there is something lacking in you that doesn’t make you eligible to receive affection. But then you look at yourself in the mirror and remind yourself how far you have come, how you physically and emotionally changed - and you just can’t understand why this is happening.

Last night was one of the most beautiful and equally heartbreaking nights of my life. A guy am super into came to my house. We had met on Tinder then met for coffee three weeks ago. We remained talking online during this period, and he had been going through personal and family issues and felt safe with me (this is one of my strongest suits, people feel comfortable talking to me, that’s why I make friends very easily, just not romantically). He came, laid on my bed, and I hugged him for most of the session, listening to everything he wanted to say, and offering my input and advice. It was such a bittersweet moment, because while I was experiencing some of the most intense emotional and physical attraction I ever had, I did sense he’s into me as a confidante, but not more. I held his hands, allowing him to feel safe to talk - but we never exchanged any kiss or anything beyond that. As he left the house, I burst into tears - telling myself that I don’t think am ready to go through this again. I was so happy he came over, I was intensely grateful but I was also embracing the pain of, yet again, not having the person I wanted.

I frequently ask myself: am I a victim? For having been never shown emotional nor physical affection? I like to think to myself that I’m not - because I am a positive person who doesn’t like to dwell on self pity - but it really hurts man. It hurts meeting people you fall for, only to be told that what applies to others doesn’t apply to you. That what happens in hookups won’t happen to you, pleasure-wise, and that the emotional love you give won’t be reciprocated. You sit there, looking at a person you like in the eye, listening about how they’re fond of this guy or that dude, and it seems like it’s never going to be your turn. That you’re invisible, just there in the background. That you have to be a witness of love and emotional/physical pleasure that others enjoy, but never be a part of it.

After years of one-sided love stories, one-sided hookups and so many suppressed emotions, you wonder if you’re transforming to an alien. Perhaps I am. ",1,1741613019.0,askgaybros,0,1.0,False
1j7yh1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDSOFFA/comments/1j7yh1d/ex_girlfriend_with_bpd_lies_constantly_and_is/,Ex Girlfriend with BPD lies constantly and is extremely manipulative,"This is my first relationship with a girl who suffers from BPD, and its been an emotional rollercoaster over the last 9 months. My girlfriend who I met on Bumble we started dating in May of 2024. The beginning was amazing, i’ve never had a connection with someone like this on a dating app before, it felt like the strongest connection. Our first date she asked alot of questions and after she tried to kiss me when I hugged her, and I thought she got offended I didn’t kiss her. 

After that things picked up, I asked for a second date and after that we were in a relationship a month later. I met her family and friends, but I had this gut feeling something wasn’t right about her, its too good to be true. I noticed anytime we hangout her phone was on DND, and occasionally face down. I could never hold her phone or look at it. She maintained a high presence on social media and I could tell craved external validation. I was also told by her she just had depression. One night at dinner she was arguing with her sister and her eyes were black and empty, souless eyes. I never seen those before but I was terrified, I later foundout she dissociates all the time.

Our relationship was focused highly around sex. She had a huge sex drive and always wanted sex or talked sexually. Used sex as a weapon when she was mad or used it to get what she wants. She always hated protection. 

She mentioned a few times she wanted to get off her medication for depression, subtle things she would say. Again, I still felt something was off with her, she was rushing to get into a relationship. I remember asking about her ex and she talked badly about him, saying he never paid for anything and she withheld sex from him. She mentioned her first ex was abusive and never really explained why but he was controlling. All previous ex’s were controlling, crazy, or always wanted to see where she was at. She sat me down one day after dinner asking if women talk to me and do I talk to other women? I told her im loyal and thats not something to worry about, she then pretended she was a girl and started talking to me to see how’d I respond.

I didn’t want to be that ex or controlling but one day at a party she was hanging out with me and she opened a Snapchat from a guy right next to me, a guy she continuously talks to. I told her I don’t like that at all, which she was anxious about my response. I noticed guys would constantly Snapchat her and I’d confront her about it, yet she would blatantly lie saying its her friend who’s a girl. 

She would repeatedly tell me she’s walking on eggshells but I would explain that Im not allowed to talk to other women but its okay for you to talk to other men? She mentioned if this keeps happening she will “self sabatoge badly.” Not sure what that meant. 

After this, when I’d walk into the room, she’d put her phone down immediately when I’d walk in. If I asked to see her phone, she mentioned all trust would be lost. Even sharing locations, she shares it with all her friends, family, but not me, even with her ex when they were together. She told me “you’re fighting my trust.” I was cheated on once that I explained to her, so her behavior was making me anxious. When hanging out, i’d see her addictively messaging someone on Snapchat behind her water bottle or between her legs, or under her arm. Her behavior was extremely childish, she wasn’t good at hiding anything.

I’d send her a message at dinner and her phone screen wouldn’t activate so her notifications were turned off. It turns out after 9 months she cheated on me with her ex and a guy she was seeing when she met me, as a form of revenge. For some reason, if someone is controlling to her or asserts boundaries she self sabatoges out of anger and spite, which she did. I never fully understood this aspect of BPD. 

She lied about having BPD and mentioned to me one night at dinner that she has it, and takes alot of medications for it. She lied constantly about seeing her ex, while having bruises all over her inner thighs and thighs, her butt, and all over her vagina from cheating. Claiming its from “me” and when asked about the bruises she goes I bruise all the time, and “you see how you don’t trust me.” She had dark finger pad bruises all over, even one day she wouldn’t take her pants off in front of me because of then. She would cry and say the bruises are from her “anemia” including bruises on her hips from her jeans. One day she accused me of cheating out the blue while getting coffee, so I called her out on it for projecting and she changed what she said and goes that never happened I said “I know you’d never cheat on me.” 

I’ve never been cheated on this badly, to hide the bruises she would claim she got her period right before sex. She would wear my favorite underwear on her before sex but said I got my period and wouldn’t take them off. For months we would eat dinner and i’d pay, do everything for her, and she would sit at the table without an ounce of remorse. She continued to lie and gaslight, even to the point I would call her out for being lying and cheating, yet she’d claim “im abusive.” 

Everytime I’d call her out on the bruises, sometimes full blown handprints, she would get all scared and walk over and kiss my shoulder, like a sad child. Everything was a facade and a lie, she had an extremely high body count and brought many guys home to the family but it never worked out.

Whats crazy is she posts on social media after our breakup about how loyal she is and religious, although behind closed doors shes a horrible human being. She’s clinging hard to protect her reputation after I went no contact, but does anyone believe this is typical for BPD behavior? The double standard was absurd, she would constantly want to see my phone or hated women talking to me. 

Before we broke up after she got caught cheating and still denied it. She mentioned she doesn’t feel romantic and wants a relationship where a “guy would throw her up on the kitchen counter and have sex with her.” And mentioned she wanted games like sex roulette and sex jenga, anything spontaneous about sex.


I wanted to list other behaviors
-extremely sensitive to rejection
-zero accountability 
-blame shift and gaslight (she knew all these terms)
-Self loathing and negative self talk
-extremely low self esteem 
-couldn’t sit with her own thoughts, constant distractions 
-extreme highs and lows
-horrible grudges one day, the next day shes loving
-pathalogical lying
-hypersexual 
-dissociation 
-empty eyes

I've quit a few times, but without any real effort or desire to quit long term, just more that I felt i should cut down. I'd also enjoy the relief I'd feel after I'd overcome the withdrawal symptoms. Anytime I go 28 hours or more without a coffee, I always get a headache. I sort of enjoy the headache in a weird way,as it feels like I'm detaching from my coffee dependence, but I'll usually be back on coffee within a week or 2.

Now, I have a young child who wakes me up around 5.30 to 6am every morning.

Perhaps I'll sleep better and find getting up easier.. willing to give it a try for a few days anyway.

Bill Gates Weighs In!,"Bill Gates just casually dropped a bombshell on our tech-fueled future: AI assistants are about to become as essential as your morning coffee. Inspired by the meteoric rise of personal computers, Gates believes intelligent agents will soon infiltrate every nook of our daily lives, optimizing tasks with an efficiency that could cause even Marie Kondo to raise an eyebrow.

**The Revolution: Beyond Just a Buzzword**

Remember when PCs were exclusive toys for corporate bigwigs before sneaking into homes everywhere? Gates predicts AI will take a similar trajectory—a friendly, omnipresent helper eager to streamline your life.

But wait, that tech utopia comes with a price tag. While it's true that AI might free us from mundane tasks, its autonomy could also spell doom for a slew of jobs, spanning from hotel receptionists to construction workers. And here's the kicker: according to a recent study, 37% of businesses have already started the switch.

**Our Dystopian or Utopian Reality?**

Silicon Valley investor Vinod Khosla takes the doom-o-meter up a notch, suggesting that AI might gobble up 80% of jobs, including engineers and doctors, within 25 years. Meanwhile, Gates offers a glimmer of hope by concluding that only energy, biology, and AI development jobs are likely to stand the test of time without being gobbled up by machines.

So here's the million-dollar question: Is AI about to trigger a job Armageddon, or is it merely the dawn of a tech renaissance? And how do you plan on surviving it? 🤔 Let’s discuss your thoughts and survival strategies in the comments below!",1,1741612484.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

I (23f) have worked in the service industry as a barista at an independent cafe for the past 6 months. Earlier this week, I took half a payment for a table of two girls (one came up to pay for her drink, the other didn’t and left without paying). It’s a big cafe, seats around 50 people and I often work with my back to the room on the coffee machine so I didn’t notice the other girl leave. My manager today told me that because I had taken half the payment at the till, I was responsible for the rest of the payment and I should be liable to pay the loss to the business. 

It was a really busy day and I often work solo behind the bar. We have staff on the front that take orders and bring food. We are all trained to take payments at the till on my station. 

Some important context, I’m in England and the new tipping laws mean employers can’t take any percentage of tips for themselves. Previously our tips were used if tables left without paying. Is my boss trying to find some ‘legal’ workaround for this? He mentioned that it’s ’in my contract’ which states this in the deductions from pay section: 

‘Any cost of repairing damage to, or loss of property, fines or charges imposed upon, or any other loss sustained by the company (or any third party), caused by your breach of contract, breach of the company’s rules, or as a result of negligence or dishonesty on your part’

I can't help thinking how much more comfortable and optimistic I'd feel in my situation pre 2020. Why has the UK come off so much worse than other countries? I visited Melbourne, Australia and drew come comparisons.

**Travel**

🇬🇧 London (1hr 25 mins) costs over £100 for a peak return and a two short tube journeys.   
Petrol is £1.40. I recall paying £2 a litre for diesel a few years back.

🇦🇺 A return 30 minute train into the city and travel on trams cost less than $10 in total.  
Petrol is $1.50 per litre.  
  
**Drinks**  
  
🇬🇧 A regular latte is now over £4. Hit and miss depending on who serves you. A pint in most pubs is £7.

🇦🇺 Coffee was no more than $5 (£2.43) and usually very good quality with properly trained baristas. A pint varied between $10 and $17.

**Public Services**

🇬🇧 Council tax is just under £300 per month. We now have to pay extra if we want green bins collected. The parks and public areas look very run down and it's mainly local volunteers picking up litter and trimming the bushes. There is vandalism and nothing gets repaired. I cannot get seen by a doctor and I have visit the hospital if myself, wife or child is ill to receive antibiotics.

🇦🇺 The parks are beautifully maintained with BBQ facilities and there is constant improvements to the infrastructure. You can get a doctor or dentist appointment on the day you call and they actually show compassion. There are Olympic standard running tracks open to the public. I didn't witness any anti social behaviour and felt very safe walking around at any time of the day.

**Housing**

🇬🇧 Stamp duty holidays, previously low interest rates and COVID has made the property market go bonkers. The previous owner of my house profited over 50% (they bought just before COVID) and sold less than 3 years later. They did no work to the house. I've spent over £30K on renovations so far.   
I profited 13% in 5 years (minus renovations, new boiler etc) so more like 10%.

My neighbour paid under £10K for their house (a second home) in the 1970's and the house is rarely occupied.

🇦🇺 Not as familiar with the housing situation in Australia but aware it has obviously also increased substantially although it seems more affordable than London. Although some my friend's monthly payments have gone up thousands with the interest rate rise.

**Tax**

🇬🇧 My effective tax rate is 43.0% if you take into account Income Tax, NI, lost personal allowance, lost Child Benefit, and nursery costs. Tax thresholds are frozen until 2028 in the UK but have been frozen since 2021.

🇦🇺 Seems taxed at a similar level. Australia implemented the Stage Three tax cuts, which came into effect on 1 July 2024 and there is no date set for an increase. ",0,1741612422.0,AskUK,30,0.29,False

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s that is 25+ to your early 30s ideally please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way. 

I love salmon my favourite fish and I love avocados they are so good for the skin. I love having nice burgers out and I also make my own from scratch smash burgers making your own is the best way at home. I love Italian food pasta and pizza the proper stuff being close to Italy we get a lot of the authentic Italian food here. 

I love Indian food too curries for me are probably my favourite food out of them all I don’t think you can beat this type of food when it’s done properly. Fish and chips proper English style would also be a favourite of mine. 

Burgers I love five guys and shake shack we had Both of these when I lived in the UK. In France we have five guys but I also love Burger King I love the flame grilled burgers 

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings either and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have an cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t have any heavy makeup fake tan fake nails fake eyelashes and fake hair and nails. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

I started HRT 3 days ago and yesterday took lorazepam in the afternoon due to bad anxiety.  I became extremely out of it and ended up going to bed really early. Woke up this morning and thought all was well, until I tried to buy a coffee and my card got rejected. I checked my balance and my account was overdrawn. I then looked at my email and discovered that I had signed up for an expensive exercise app (absolutely not something I would normally do). I don’t remember doing it, other than a very vague dream like memory of seeing the app somewhere. 

I also have a small cyst on my head and it was sore when I woke up - I have the same vague dream like memory of deciding to dig it out of my head with the sharp end of a blackhead remover, so I guess I did that too!

All I can assume is that it was a bad reaction between the drugs? I will be following up with my doctor, but just wanted to see if this is a known thing? I feel like a lost myself for the evening.

My parents were fighting all the time, me being unheard and ignored since I was a kid and that has always affected my academic and social life. For context, I used to look for attention, validation and love everywhere except my so called 'home'. But since I am more mature than I was before, I realised who was at fault all this time. My mom comes from a poor and neutral family with no big of a family background(just nana, nani and her) and my dad is from a well reputed family in our town. So, the thing is my mom is too much of a orthodox and she doesn't know how to adapt with the pace of the world. My dad was not in a good financial state at the time of marriage but he worked very hard and thankfully we are at a much better place now and due to this my dad has adapted with the lifestyle upgrade he has given to us all by himself. On the other hand, my mom also works as a teacher in a government school and she earns well too but she never upgraded herself in any way. Her mentality is too cheap(I couldn't find a better word) like she everytime yells at me for getting anything more expensive than 1k (My dad gets me all those hyped up goodies). She herself is like that and wants us to be like that too and that has been a major reason for my parents' fight.

THE BIGGEST REASON FOR ME TO HATE HER is that she always put fake allegations on me whenever I don't listen to her. Yesterday she told me to do something but I was busy (last 5 overs of the final match) in my room and I told her to wait for some time and that happened to be my worst mistake. She started yelling and saying that I smoke in my room or I possess some drugs just because I keep my door close just for some privacy. This was just one instance but she does it almost everyday. She has always done my character assassination or alleging me in every possible wrong doing. I SWEAR I'VE NEVER TOUCHED ANY KIND OF HIGHS IN MY LIFE. I DON'T EVEN DRINK COFFEE OR TEA.

I am concerned because I have a little sister who was born very late(my mom has faced 6 miscarriages). She's just 3yo and my mom is already saying statements while fighting with my dad like ""Ladka bada hua to nasho mein bigda ab ladki bhi badi hogi to wo bhi bigdegi aur meri nahi sunegi"". Like bro she's just 3yo, how can someone say that for their own daughter.

She's too dramatic and she never misses a chance to mess up my mental health. She always ruins every happy moment I have.

I HATE HER SO MUCH !!!

The room smells of cheap rakija, stale cigarette smoke, and instant coffee. The walls are thin, the mattress is worse than the one back home, and the only light is the flickering neon from a kebab shop across the street.

Juliet is lying on the bed, pale, looking like she just did a double shift in 35-degree heat without a break. Romeo stumbles in, still in his Lidl uniform, smelling of sweat and stress, a half-smoked cigarette shaking in his fingers.

ROMEO: (muttering to himself, pacing) Jebote, I knew something was wrong… Nobody picks up phone, nobody answers messages. I swear to God, I work one fucking shift extra and— Bože moj, what is this?

(He sees Juliet lying there, too still. His stomach drops. He freezes, then rushes to her, shaking her shoulder.)

ROMEO: Julka… Julka, wake up, ajde… Stop with the jokes, bre. This is not funny, I swear to God…

(Silence. He swallows hard, his face twisting, trying to keep it together, but his breath starts shaking.)

ROMEO: Jebem ti sve… No, no, no… You cannot do this to me. We were supposed to go back home, remember? Get out of this fucking German hellhole… Open bar, whole village comes, my mother already talking to some priest…

(He stares at her. His whole body sags like someone cut the strings.)

Fak.

(He rubs his face hard, then pulls out a small plastic bottle from his pocket. Takes a long look at it, shaking his head.)

So… This is it, ha? Work all summer, send money home, and then just… go out like this. Like some idiot.

(He pops the cap open, muttering to himself.)

Fuck it. Who wants to go back anyway?

(Throws the rakija back like it’s a shot, then follows with the poison, grimacing.)

ROMEO: Jebiga.

(He leans back against the wall, staring up at the shitty ceiling, waiting. His breathing slows.)

Juliet suddenly gasps. Her eyes flutter open. She groans, rubbing her head.

JULIET: Ugh… Jesi normalan? My head hurts like crazy… How long was I out?

(She blinks at Romeo, confused.)

JULIET: …Halo? What are you doing?

(She sees the empty bottle in his hand. Her face drops.)

JULIET: O majko mila… No, no, no, no—what the fuck did you do, bre?!

ROMEO: (weak smile, voice slurring) Well, you were dead, so… I just, you know… I fix it.

JULIET: Fix what?! Tupane! You couldn’t wait five fucking minutes?!

ROMEO: (laughs a little, coughing) Yeah, I don’t have patience… You know this…

(Juliet grabs him, shaking him, panic rising.)

JULIET: Romeo! Romeo, brate, stay awake! We can fix this! We find a doctor, we—

ROMEO: (quietly, smiling like an idiot) No doctor, Julka… Only God now…

(His head slumps forward.)

JULIET: Jebem ti sunce…

(She lets out a strangled sound, somewhere between a sob and a swear, then grabs his stupid, sweaty face in her hands.)

You did this for me?

(Silence. She wipes her face roughly, looking around the tiny, ugly-ass room. Takes a shaky breath.)

Fuck it.

(She grabs Romeo’s half-smoked cigarette from the ashtray, takes a deep drag, then pulls out his work knife from his pocket. Twirls it in her fingers, nods to herself.)

Fine. If we go, we go together. No way I’m going back home alone, just to explain this shit.

(She leans in, kisses his forehead, and—cut to black.)

IM NOT FEELING VERY FIRST CLASS👎🏻

I entered the Emirates first class lounge. I maxxed out 2 credit cards to get here,  I look at the testimonials on the website at the happy couples of rich people smiling with champagne. 

I don’t drink champagne but I might be wrong in that department. What if my life sucks and I’m not happy because I didn’t spend $24k on a first class emirates flight and I’m not drinking champagne, what if this will make my life whole?!

Don’t you understand?! It’s the little thing, the details. This very act of being flight class may mean my ex’s and father will finally respect me. 

Anyway, as I enter the first class lounge. A Thai lady (perhaps a man, we all know the reputation) speaks in some foreign tongue, presumably greeting me or perhaps trying to convince me to smuggle drugs for them idk. 

I politely say I’m not looking for a massage with a happy ending rn, I bow whilst playing a gong sound effect from my phone and leave, much to her confusion. 

Then someone asks if I’d like a drink, I ask for a Coke Zero, she says she only has Pepsi and if that’s okay? It’s NOT, but I stay composed, shaking slightly and manage to hold in every tear apart from one which rolls down my cheek. I piss myself slightly of out anger. 

She sees I’m upset and asks if I’d like anything stronger, I say yes and ask her get me a Diet COKE. She rudely reminds me and says it’ll have to be a Diet PEPSI seeing as they don’t have COKE in FIRST CLASS. The bitch is taunting me. I laugh manically, wiping the sweat from my forehead that’s pouring down and say “no problemo”, I follow her down the hallway and throw her off the balcony, presumably killing her. 

Don’t worry, in first class you can do that to like 5-6 staff before they start caring. It’s the little things. 

I notice from the balcony in the FIRST CLASS lounge we’re on the TOP floor because I’m FIRST CLASS. Naturally, I throw my can of Diet Coke (actually PEPSI, cheap bastards) at the poor person below in economy off a 30 foot balcony to ease my stress. A member of staff looks distressed, asking why I did that, and I replied because they’re below me, and if they were in FIRST CLASS and I were in economy, they’d drop a can of Diet PEPSI (NOT coke) on my head too, those selfish bastards.

Several other rich people in the FIRST CLASS lounge look at me approvingly, they’re just like me because we’re FIRST CLASS people. They respect what I just did. 

I glance around the first class lounge, there’s a coffee MACHINE. Wow, this really is FIRST CLASS. Instead of having to interact with a blue haired liberal with mental health issues in Starbucks, I can use a MACHINE. this is the future. 

After getting my quadruple espresso I approach a member of staff. Turns out it’s the lady that I threw off the balcony, she’s survived and back at her post, bleeding out of her mouth in a wheelchair. I ask her to call the inventor of this wonderful coffee machine. 

She, confused but clearly in pain (rude) brings me the phone and after 30 mins on hold, I say “compliments to the chef” to the Chinese sweatshop worker who answers the phone, they babble gibberish back and I hang up. It’s the little things. I throw the same member of staff off the balcony again to finish the job, much to her protest. Pepsi serving bitch. 

Anyway, boarding comes and I’m excited to get on the flight FIRST through priority boarding, one of the many perks of being FIRST CLASS. 

I head to the gate, stepping over the body of the staff members I’ve thrown off the balcony and attempt to board the plane. I’m shaking from excitement, licking my lips at the taste of finally being happy in life. I’m FIRST CLASS",2,1741611978.0,copypasta,0,0.75,False

I watched countless videos and read a lot of posts and I think I know what I would like to buy. I want to run some things past you before I press the buy button.  
I have a Moccamaster paired with a Wilfa Svart Aroma grinder. I only drink black filter coffee at home. When at work I drink flat whites and I really like them. Very recently, I thought what if I start making them at home? I've never done that before, so I have no experience with espresso making nor I do consider myself somebody who can pick up coffee hints at the moment. I see this exercise as a new hobby, so it's more about the experience really and drinking some good coffee at home. I am not looking to be the next world champion barista.  
  
Both my wife and I like medium-dark roasts with a particular knack for hazelnut flavoured beans from a local coffee roaster.  
So I narrowed down my list to the Sage Bambino Plus paired with the Eureka Mignon Zero. Then I started having doubts about the Bambino Plus because of the issues I read online. It also has a 54mm portafilter so if I wanted to buy a botomless portafilter and some accessories for it and then decide to upgrade to something that has a 58mm portafilter, I'd have to buy the accessories again.  
The Bambino Plus is £400 new and it sells for about £200 on ebay, plus £100 for the accessories give or take, which brings us to £300 potentially going to waste. I looked up what I could get in the region of £700-£800 and it boiled down to the Profitec Go. It's a single boiler, yes, but from what I read it is a really good one and most probably I won't upgrade to anything better. I know it needs a bit more time to warm up compared to the Bambino, but I will hook it up to a smart plug so when I wake up it will be nice and toasty. It looks stunning too and I like the pressure gauge and the little temperature display. Going from espresso to steaming milk and waiting for the temp to rise and fall is not really an issue for me.  
  
I plan to make two coffees in the morning, a flat white for me and a cappuccino for the Mrs. Maybe the same with decaf beans in the afternoon, but not every day. We rarely have more coffee than that.  
  
Let's move on to the grinder. I don't particularly like the idea of bellows but the Eureka grinders seem very solid. However, switching between grinding for espresso and filter doesn't seem the easiest thing with a Eureka grinder. I don't necesserily need to have a single grinder for both filter and espresso, but if I can have that, excellent. I then started exploring the possibility of getting a Niche Zero. It's £600 new, but there are a few available for about £300. It's a bit over my budget, but not that much especially if I can use it for both espresso and filter. I know that people say it's not particularly suited for filter coffee, but will it produce something better than my Wilfa? If so, then it's a winner! I am looking for something that is easy to dial in and the workflow is easily repeatable. Is it a bad idea to buy the Niche second hand?

The corner on my countertop where all of the espresso coffee kit will live is W50cm x D55cm x H45cm.

What do you think?

My parents were fighting all the time, me being unheard and ignored since I was a kid and that has always affected my academic and social life. For context, I used to look for attention, validation and love everywhere except my so called 'home'. But since I am more mature than I was before, I realised who was at fault all this time. My mom comes from a poor and neutral family with no big of a family background(just nana, nani and her) and my dad is from a well reputed family in our town. So, the thing is my mom is too much of a orthodox and she doesn't know how to adapt with the pace of the world. My dad was not in a good financial state at the time of marriage but he worked very hard and thankfully we are at a much better place now and due to this my dad has adapted with the lifestyle upgrade he has given to us all by himself. On the other hand, my mom also works as a teacher in a government school and she earns well too but she never upgraded herself in any way. Her mentality is too cheap(I couldn't find a better word) like she everytime yells at me for getting anything more expensive than 1k (My dad gets me all those hyped up goodies). She herself is like that and wants us to be like that too and that has been a major reason for my parents' fight. 

THE BIGGEST REASON FOR ME TO HATE HER is that she always put fake allegations on me whenever I don't listen to her. Yesterday she told me to do something but I was busy (last 5 overs of the final match) in my room and I told her to wait for some time and that happened to be my worst mistake. She started yelling and saying that I smoke in my room or I possess some drugs just because I keep my door close just for some privacy. This was just one instance but she does it almost everyday. She has always done my character assassination or alleging me in every possible wrong doing. I SWEAR I'VE NEVER TOUCHED ANY KIND OF HIGHS IN MY LIFE. I DON'T EVEN DRINK COFFEE OR TEA.

I am concerned because I have a little sister who was born very late(my mom has faced 6 miscarriages). She's just 3yo and my mom is already saying statements while fighting with my dad like ""Ladka bada hua to nasho mein bigda ab ladki bhi badi hogi to wo bhi bigdegi aur meri nahi sunegi"". Like bro she's just 3yo, how can someone say that for their own daughter.

She's too dramatic and she never misses a chance to mess up my mental health. She always ruins every happy moment I have.

1j7y0pk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j7y0pk,"Van Leeuwen Honeycomb: great name, ordinary flavor. Coffee Affogato: for lovers of milk fat flavor in sweet cream.","I’ve only tried two Van Leeuwen flavors so far (Earl Gray Tea: love!; Thai Iced Tea: very disappointing), and today I’ve got the chance to try two more. 

##Honeycomb

I did not read the label on this one and I was disappointed to find the description says there is no honey in the ice cream at all but instead caramel candy. Bummer but it’s on me I suppose. 

* Ice cream base: Good texture. Its vanilla meets a sweet flavoring that has a similarity to a honey taste. Just a little more floral than a straight up caramel would be. 
* caramel candy: honey color. Not really a candy. Slight bits of sugar crystal but nothing crunchy. Is a caramel taste. Light at first but deepens into a classic caramel taste (buttery, rooch). Actually as I dig in more I’ve found one crunchy candy, like a small sugar crystal mass. 

**Rating: 6.5/10. This is perfectly good ice cream. Has great texture and a nice lighter, slightly floral caramel taste. It’s honey adjacent. Just doesn’t really have any tricks besides its alluring name and is a case of unmet high expectations for me. If it had more crunchy bits, I think it would be a good one as sugar crystals are a nice idea. 

##Coffee Affogato

I never had it but Google says that Coffee Affogato is a simple Italian dessert of a big scoop of vanilla ice cream with a hot shot of espresso poured on top. 

In a similar fashion Van Leeuwen Coffee Affogato is a half half duo of a sweet cream ice cream and coffee ice cream. 

* Sweet cream ice cream: Sweet cream has been described as what an ice cream base tastes like without any added flavoring. Here the taste has more in common with a high fat half and half creamer than vanilla. Just a rich, fatty milk taste that lingers on your tongue after you’ve eaten. Mmmm. 
* Coffee ice cream: Not strong like an espresso. Can taste a roasted element like Haagen Dazs Coffee with a similar coffee + milk flavor. Maybe a little less roasted or complex. More milk fat flavor. 

**Rating: 8/10. I think this flavor would be excellent in a duo (pairs well with the fragrant brightness that VL Earl Gray Tea has) or trio but is a little lackluster in itself with the two flavors it has not contrasting as much as it could, and not having additional textures either. But ice creams with this much milk fat flavor that lingers on the tongue long after the ice cream is eaten are rare. If you want to complement another ice cream, or prize the flavor of hard-to-find sweet cream and like coffee, I would certainly consider Coffee Affogato. 

##Related ice cream:

* Haagen Dazs - Coffee. Just slightly more roasted. 
* Ben and Jerry’s - Vanilla. More of a sweet cream flavor than vanilla. Denser, less air. 

##Ranking 

So far with the four Van Leeuwen flavors I’ve tried I’d put Earl Gray Tea as still #1, Coffee Affogato #2, Honeycomb #3, Thai Iced Tea a distant #4.

Knocking on doors and talking to strangers is a pants wetting experience for countless people. Yes, it took some collective courage for JWs to do that.  However, the zeitgeist has changed. I think Western nations and especially the US have shifted profoundly in social attitudes. Forms of introversion arise while clubs, bowling teams and church attendance commonly fade.  Some polls suggest a surprising aversion by young men against chatting up females or asking them out.  Part of this may also relate to obnoxious behavior in stores and restaurants by people who think they are privileged, apart from the rest of us.

The internet and Covid have both had their effects on socialization.  The Watchtower is going backwards in time as to phonographs, use of radio and testimony cards ...... now video streaming and drinking coffee while hanging out with a cart.  Or mailing letters (gives the Post Office business, I guess).

They'll still be a few older zealots who trot from house to house but in the main, they'll never get it back. Indeed, meeting attendance and commenting will fade as well because of this trend towards social isolation. I don't see any way around it. ",28,1741611348.0,exjw,6,0.94,False

Our relationship was tumultuous to say the least but I’m still struggling with losing her. 

After a year without intimacy or much luck dating after our breakup I met someone new, it only lasted a few months before it fell apart. I was sad but not like before. 

While dating someone else was a temporary break from the more extreme feelings I had for my ex. TBH my ex has always been on my mind throughout.

After a long break of no contact my ex and I started messaging inconsistently a few months ago. We are both visiting the town we met in and she offered to meet up for coffee. I declined because I was scared. 

I respect her boundaries that she has moved on, but hearing from her has thrown me further into the black hole of depression and anxiety. I can’t sleep because I’m so mad at myself for being hung up, sad because I truly miss her and lost because I’m increasingly unmotivated in career/personal life goals.

I’ve talked to a therapist since we first hit a rough patch. Quit drinking, smoking pot and changed my diet. 

I want to get better and I do believe there’s a person out there for me to fall in love again.

1j7xv4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1j7xv4f/one_that_got_away_she_reached_out/,One That Got Away - She Reached Out.,"Hey Guys, 

(37M)

There's always been 'someone' going back to highschool. We used to spend evenings messaging and talking back in the day, due to timings and general life / uni / moving away/relationships we never got the opportunity to make a go of it, she always lingered in my thoughts and I'd check in on her on social media etc, I always wondered 'what if' 

Anyway, 6 years ago I found out she was newly single (I also was) I reached out and we reconnected, we started a physical casual relationship (the chemistry was amazing) and she'd admitted she'd always thought of me also. By this time she was a new mother and had separated from the father, I never asked too much about their breakup but it seemed kinda messy I wanted to respect her privacy and selfishly didn't wanna get caught up in it, I was emotionally quite guarded also, I'd had a string of relationships that had hardened me and made me pretty cynical. I was skeptical how long she would be around for, there was periods where she would kinda go 'dark' for a few weeks but I gave her space due to her situation but I never really put my all into her as I should have. I was scared having no kids myself, her being a new mum a messy breakup and everything that went with it. 

I confessed my love for her way too late, by this time I think she'd checked out and was focusing on her daughter. I was ringing her, messaging her and she wouldn't pick up. I told her I loved her because I didn't want her to know I never cared. I did. 

Years went by of no contact. I thought this door was well and truly closed. I'd opened my heart and made myself emotionally vulnerable and it wasn't reciprocated. I understand that's fine, noone is obligated. I just showed my feelings way too late I have to carry that around. She remained in my thoughts. 

I started dating, I met a fantastic girl long story short 5 years later we have a house and a couple of animals. My girlfriend will struggle to biologically carry a child, it's not impossible just super risky for her. It's something we said we'd both like we just need to get the facts and see what options are available. I'd like a family I think. 

Anyway. The other woman reached out and we started talking one evening, catching up. Curiosity got the better of me and I asked if there was ever a chance for us ? There was a prolonged emotional outpouring where we talked about what went wrong, how life was different and we were poor communicators. She offered to explain it over a coffee. 

The next mourning riddled with guilt I messaged her and said basically that I have a girlfriend and this isn't appropriate, I should have told her the previous evening. She understood and basically said that she knew the chances would be slim that I was single, my new girlfriend is very lucky. If I ever want that coffee one day to let her know. 

A few days went past and I couldn't even think straight my head was a mess so many reprressed feelings had bubbled to the surface. I reached out and said maybe we should meet for that coffee to talk about things / get closure/ tie up loose ends. I couldn't understand why my feelings were so raw still. 

We arranged to meet a week to the day, we kept in contact. I was physically ill with guilt and shame, I was shaking, couldn't eat etc. I called it off the day before and said my current girlfriend doesn't deserve this (she absolutely doesn't) she's only done right by me. The other woman messaged back and said she was heartbroken, there will always be hope and there will never be another love like this. 

I just feel super sad, mourning the life that could have been with the person I felt it should have been with at one time. 

My life now is pretty good, my girlfriend is supportive and kind. Our social circles are intertwined she gets on with my family etc. We have a nice house. 

What was I supposed to do ? Wait for this person not knowing if this day would come. 

In the aftermath I've been emotionally drained and I'm trying to get back on track. I have up and down days that are taking a toll but I'm getting more positive everyday. There's been some things it's forced me to discuss with my girlfriend, the future m, starting a family (if possible) etc

I don't know what I'm trying to achieve with this post, maybe because I can't talk to anyone about it without word getting out.

1j7xuoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1j7xuoq/i_wanted_whiter_teeth_without_the_dentist_heres/,I Wanted Whiter Teeth Without the Dentist – Here’s What Happened,"I’ve always been a little self-conscious about my teeth. They weren’t awful, but years of coffee, tea, and general life had made them dull. I knew professional whitening at the dentist would cost a fortune, so I figured I’d try an at-home solution first.

I’ve used whitening strips before, but they either didn’t work well or made my teeth super sensitive. Then I came across **Laughland teeth whitening**, which is supposed to be **dentist-formulated** and **uses an LED mouthpiece** to activate the gel. It seemed different from other products I had tried, so I decided to give it a go.

This is what I learned after using it for six days.

# What’s Inside the Laughland Teeth Whitening Kit?

The first thing I noticed when I opened the box was how simple the setup was. There were no complicated steps or weird trays to deal with. The kit included a **gel pen for easy application, an LED mouthpiece to activate the whitening process, and clear instructions that didn’t overcomplicate things.**

The packaging felt well-made, and everything looked clean and professional. I had a good first impression, but the real question was: **Would it actually work?**

# How It Works

Using Laughland teeth whitening was surprisingly easy. Each session takes **10 minutes**, so it wasn’t a big time commitment. Here’s the process I followed every day:

1. Brushed my teeth and made sure they were dry.
2. Applied the whitening gel using the pen, making sure to coat each tooth evenly.
3. Put the LED mouthpiece in and let it do its thing for 10 minutes.
4. Rinsed my mouth and cleaned the mouthpiece for the next use.

The first thing I appreciated was that **the gel didn’t have a strong chemical taste**. Some whitening products I’ve tried in the past had a weird aftertaste, but this one was mild.

# What I Noticed Over 6 Days

* **Day 1:** No immediate difference, but my teeth felt extra clean.
* **Day 3:** I started noticing a small but real change—less yellowing, especially near the edges.
* **Day 6:** My teeth were significantly whiter, probably around **6-7 shades brighter** overall.

The best part? **No pain, no sensitivity, no weird zinging feeling in my teeth.** That alone made this experience better than any strips I had used before.

# What Makes Laughland Different from Other Whitening Methods?

* **Whitening strips** always left my teeth feeling sensitive, and the results were uneven.
* **Whitening toothpaste** is good for maintenance but doesn’t actually remove deep stains.
* **Professional whitening treatments** are expensive and can cause discomfort for days.

Laughland felt like **a solid middle-ground solution**—more effective than strips, less expensive than professional treatments, and no sensitivity issues.

**If you’re curious to see if it works for you, you can check it out** [**here**](https://getlaughland.com/offer-01/?lpid=1039&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1039&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1039&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1039&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)**.**

# Is It Worth It?

For me, **Laughland teeth whitening actually made a visible difference** in less than a week. My teeth look **brighter but still natural**, and I didn’t have to deal with pain or sensitivity.

Would it replace a professional whitening session at the dentist? Probably not if you’re looking for extreme results. But for an affordable, easy-to-use solution that noticeably brightens teeth, I’d say it’s worth it.

I’ll definitely be using it again for maintenance, and I’m glad I didn’t waste money on another set of whitening strips that barely do anything.

How crazy is that idea?

We are not super peaky on the chemistry of coffee, we have a simple espresso machine, simple grinder and that's it. So the super small nuances dont bother us.

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s that is 25+ to your early 30s ideally please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way. 

I love salmon my favourite fish and I love avocados they are so good for the skin. I love having nice burgers out and I also make my own from scratch smash burgers making your own is the best way at home. I love Italian food pasta and pizza the proper stuff being close to Italy we get a lot of the authentic Italian food here. 

I love Indian food too curries for me are probably my favourite food out of them all I don’t think you can beat this type of food when it’s done properly. Fish and chips proper English style would also be a favourite of mine. 

Burgers I love five guys and shake shack we had Both of these when I lived in the UK. In France we have five guys but I also love Burger King I love the flame grilled burgers 

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings either and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have an cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t have any heavy makeup fake tan fake nails fake eyelashes and fake hair and nails. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

1j7xox5,https://i.redd.it/2pjwuim8yune1.jpeg,New and Unsure,"Pretty sure I have hemochromatosis based on these ferritin levels. Maybe type 4? In Spanish as I live in Spain at the moment.

My doctors haven't done anything about it yet as I was diagnosed with metastatic spinal cancer at the same time, and they focused on the thing that would kill me in month rather than decades. That diagnosis is looking more and more like schwannomatosis, so I have time to worry about hemochromatosis again. Yay!

Found out a sister also has hemochromatosis and that my dad had it and NAFLD after asking my family some questions the other day. Not great communicators, since I had no idea until I was 47 that I should even be looking at this one in my genes.

I'm not great with needles thanks to stepping on one as a kid and it getting lodged in bone, so been taking  berberine, green tea, and green coffee daily in the meantime.The berberine should also help my cholesterol and limit schwannoma growth.

Today we launch Section 2, “Writing in the Midst of Extreme Conditions.”

Sensei introduces Nichiren’s description of the background behind his writing this treatise. He reached Sado on October 28, 1271 and arrived at Tsukahara on November 1st. He had wanted to leave a record of his essential message in case he did not survive the ordeal of exile. In January 1272 he defeated several hundred priests in a doctrinal debate. He then began writing the treatise in earnest and completed it in February 1272.

*(Please click on the link for a more detailed account of the hut where he lived, the frigid weather, and lack of food provisions.)*  

>“It is impossible to describe these matters in writing” (WND-1, 214), the Daishonin says, referring to the deplorable conditions that confronted him on Sado. He admits to feeling as though he had passed through the realm of hungry spirits and fallen alive into one of the eight cold hells (WND-1, 519). He also observes: “Exiles to this island seldom manage to survive. Even if they do, they never return home. So no one is going to be punished for killing an exile” (WND-1, 771).

>In such a perilous environment, Nichiren immersed himself deep in thought and composed an important work for the enlightenment of humankind. Over the course of approximately three months, he planned out and wrote this treatise, which, in terms of current Japanese standard, 400-character manuscript pages, comes to more than one hundred pages in length. After arriving on Sado, he set to work right away on this task to lead all people to Buddhahood. 

Back to “MY Fantasy life” (thank you, Eigenstien).

Discussion Meeting. The plans for our youth-led discussion meeting on Sunday are pretty much settled. One new piece: Charlie loves art and he does these intricate Manga-like “story boards.” He is going to present one as part of our show-and-tell.

Ice-skating. The Twinettes skated endlessly at the rink yesterday. One of the other parents there took notice and shared her daughter's hockey stick and puck with them. They are not even three-years-old but they got it. We immediately rented two sticks and a puck which they passed back and forth to each other. A group of people gathered around them and started to cheer. Somehow, I think Dee and I are going to be hockey moms!

Longhouse Elementary School. We are absolutely delighted because the State Education Department approved our charter to open up a religious private school. We have also laid the foundation to the extension to the Dewey House. Because of safety concerns we can’t take the children in Longhouse Daycare to observe and learn from the construction, but our contractor, “Bob the Builder,” takes videos and shows the progress to the kids. They are fascinated!

Ghost malls (TL;DR). Eulogio has been investing in one of his manager’s projects: converting a “ghost mall” to a “Let’s Get to Work” center. I am sharing this with his permission.

The food services wing is operating at capacity and might even have to expand. Future chefs, caterers, provisioners, baristas, etc. rent out space to kickstart their start-up food businesses. There is also a “restaurant” where they can serve their creations to friends and family. Some mothers rent time so they can prepare food in a larger kitchen than they have back home and work in a convivial space.

Last month the manager opened a kind of “WeWork” wing filled with cubicles, work spaces, conference rooms, printers, 3D printers, supplies, etc. These two centers intermingle and “WeWorkers” have a source for food, snacks, and coffee. The place is humming.

The next center is being planned. It is a “Carpentry Center” with all types of stationary power tools. It will be a great incubation space for entrepreneurs who want to build things but are not ready to open their own workshops.

The manager is tweaking his business plan because the goal is a franchisable model that can convert dirt-cheap ghost malls into grassroots businesses.

Conclusion: 

How do all of these threads come together? Our nation must move from a top-down consumption economy that brings rot into our lives into a grassroots/bottom-up glocal “we work” mindset that constructs an entrepreneurship economy. 

The source for this mindset can be huts in frigid lands such as Sado, local skating rinks, ghost malls, or tiny schools in unknown locations—that haven’t even opened up yet. 

It’s about the point of production and the lion hearts of individuals.

I feel like I am taking too much caffeine.

Now I wonder about frequent coffee drinkers, is it about the need of increasing your focus and energy? Or is it just a habit ? In other words, is it psychological or functional?

For example, if your morning coffee was 3x effective than your usual coffee (with same amount of caffeine), would you lessen your coffeee intake per day? Or would it not change anything ?",1,1741610069.0,CaffeineFreeLife,2,0.67,False
1j7xjh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HairRemoval/comments/1j7xjh0/quick_method_for_making_sugaring_wax_at_home/,Quick method for making sugaring 'wax' at home,"Working with sugar can be messy & time consuming - this method is the fastest and most mess free I have managed so far.  I've been able to make it start to finish under 10 minutes work with minimal clean-up, though I leave it to cool in a container overnight to be safe.

I've tried to suggest alternatives for equipment if you don't have it, but most can be bought for relatively low cost.

>BE AWARE - Hot sugar is very dangerous and can cause life changing burns.  Be cautious with it, and be sure not to apply it to skin without being very sure it is cool enough. If hot sugar sticks to skin, it can be very hard to remove, and cause deep burns. It's much hotter than boiling water and doesn't run off.  Be extra aware of the dangers if children are around.

Most recipes call for a few cups of sugar, but given the sugar 'wax' attracts water from the atmosphere, and it can get too sticky, and this method makes it easier to make it as needed, the quantities are much smaller.  Scale as needed.

Most also use lemon juice. For small quantities, I find food grade citric acid much more convenient - it's dry, lasts longer than lemons, tastes like cola-bottles, and even descales limescale. It could be packaged with sugar into batches to make cooking even faster for people that wanted to make it regularly.  I read on a candy-making website that 2tsp lemon juice = ½ tsp citric acid.  I reckoned that 1tsp citric acid weighs about 5g (3/16th oz?).

I've watched a lot of traditional candy making videos, and was inspired by their cooling benches when making pulled candies, so now I cool it on a sheet of steel covered with a non-stick silicone baking sheet. Any cool heatproof surface should work.

In short - I cook the sugar in a microwave until a digital thermometer shows 145C (293F), which is the hard end of the soft-crack sugar cooking stage.  Then put a silicone macaron sheet onto a cold heatproof surface to rapidly cool, before using the silicone sheet to handle/roll up the resulting toffee.

**Equipment** (for my fast method below - or, you can also use the hob, the thermometer is the critical tool) I've linked examples of the kind of things I use: 

* [cheap digital scale](https://a.co/d/6qoGlTN) (coffee-making in my case) with 0.1g resolution.  
   * spoon measures also work, but weighing is more consistent.
* pyrex/borosilicate jug/glass or microwaveable bowl
* 800W microwave (lower power takes longer, and higher is probably quicker?)
* [cheap digital thermometer](https://a.co/d/3OABf6l) (very very much recommended) - don't leave it in the microwave when running like I did...
   * Alcohol sugar thermometers are also available, but usually require large volumes to be submerged deep enough to  work reliablly.
   * Consistency of hot sugar can be assessed with a [candy making cold plate test](https://www.exploratorium.edu/explore/cooking/candy-making-stages)
* [cheap silicone macaron sheet](https://a.co/d/6uXE5LN) (they're non-stick & heatproof) - a silicone pie dish might work for larger amounts, or a softer sugar (cooked to a lower temperature, e.g. strip 'wax')
* a cold heatproof surface to put the macaron sheet on & rapidly cool the toffee (metal pizza 'stone', or perhaps heatproof glass, thick ceramic tile, stone, steel baking sheet, just not something that could crack or be damaged by heat..)
* either a tough airtight storage container you can dig a lump of sugar ""wax"" (toffee) out of with a spoon, perhaps something you can warm in a microwave to soften it a little, or a silicone container which you can de-mould the lump from - I've been trying silicone travel pots for lotions (tho not airtight).

**Ingredients** 

* 50g (1¾ oz) white sugar 
* 0.5g  dry food grade citric acid weighed out on cheap digital coffee scales on a piece of paper (or flat 1/8 tsp?)
   * (OR ½ tsp lemon juice - Using the above conversion, I think this is about equivalent, a bottle in the fridge could be handy.  Check my math!)
   * The weight isn't super critical, just needs to be enough to ""invert"" the sugar into syrup - 1g might still be ok.  First time I used 1/8th tsp.
   * 1 tsp unpacked citric acid = approx 5g IIRC 
   * It may be possible to make a larger batch of dry sugar/citric acid to use as needed, but I've not tried that, not sure if they would remain well mixed with different crystal sizes, but could be easier to weigh out, could also make a larger quantity and bag up in to portions for each session. 
* Just enough water to wet all the sugar - more just adds cooking time.

Method

Microwave on 800W for 2-3 minutes (depending on amount of water used), check the temp with a digital thermometer once dissolved.  It'll stay at approx 101°C (214°F) until most water boils off, then rises exponentially. No need to stir.  

Keep cooking for 20-30s at a time until temp gets up to about 145°C/293°F (I would suggest soft crack toffee temp, lower temp for strip wax, see below). [Abetweene (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leYYDmDdoD8) (who also has a [video about bikini ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFEqTebkUgc)& check out her other videos) says sugar should be cooked to 118-121°C (245-250°F) for soft/strip sugar & 121-127°C (250-260°F) for hard (shouldn't be syrupy, that's still soft), but I found 145°C/293°F worked better. Mine takes about 5min cooking in total at that quantity.  The temperature is critical. The colour will be different depending on the time of cooking which increases the more water you add at the start, not the temperature directly, so that's not a very reliable guide.  If you don't have a thermometer, you can do the [candy making cold plate test](https://www.exploratorium.edu/explore/cooking/candy-making-stages), I aim for between ""soft crack"" and ""hard crack"".  The thermometer is much easier.

Put a cheap silicone macaron sheet on a cool heatproof surface. The quantity I make fits easily on an full baking sheet without running off. Carefully pour the hot toffee/candy the silicone sheet (warning for life changing burns) & dab a small separate bit elsewhere on the sheet to test for cooling in a minute or so. Ideally, the silicone macaron sheet should be on a cold metal/stone/ceramic/tough glass surface that can take the heat away because it can then cool in under 5 min (metal pizza 'stone' ftw), also minimising opportunity for humidity to get into the sugar paste. 

Once rolling up the silicone sheet a little shows the test dab has hardened/set/peels away, roll the whole sheet & if the big piece of toffee peels away in one piece when released a little (not liquid in the middle or bending loads, should support its own weight fairly well) and comes unstuck from the (non-stick) silicone then it's ready to be worked, no touching or tools, no mess so long as it's cooked hot enough.  
  
A strip 'wax' consistency, cooked to a lower temperature won't set hard, and I haven't tested how well it comes unstuck from silicone, or how far it would spread, but a silicone pie dish or similar might be better for containing it if it runs off (lmk).  This method works well for firmer sugar 'waxes'.  (Let's be honest, it's candy not wax 😂).

At that point so long as its cool enough it's possible to roll up the candy/toffee in the silicone like a play-doh sausage (no touching or tools needed, the candy/toffee should be between the folded-over silicone sheet, and your hand on the other side away from the hot candy/toffee) make into a ball and put into an appropriate airtight container (sugar pulls water into it, and makes it less effective, it'll keep longer airtight). 

Cooled sugar ""wax' this hard is very tough to get out of the container, the container needs to stand up to digging with a metal spoon & helps if it can be warmed to soften it,  or be flexible for demoulding (silicone again), still experimenting with that...  (Silicone travel cosmetic pots lately, though they're not airtight, so it only lasts a week or so because they're  not airtight).

With this method, and using a steel pizza stone slab to put the silicone sheet onto for cooling, I can do this start to finish in 10 minutes.  Only the jug & thermometer needs much washing.  Touching molten sugar with utensils is a nightmare, everything just gets sticky.  This way avoids all that, and the clean-up afterwards.

If planning to use this batch immediately, be extra sure it is cool enough.  Sugar holds heat very well, and sticks like glue, it can be hard to remove if it turns out to be too hot.  I leave it overnight to be sure and warm it if needed for use.",1,1741610015.0,HairRemoval,0,1.0,False

#Picks Of The Week (by u/lefuniname)


####**1. Prdk - EMPTINESS EP [Prdk Music]**  
*Recommended if you like: Absu_NTQL, Zigi SC, Burr Oak*  

Not only is it about damn time we got back to some banging Neuro on here again, a feature on Czechia's currently most exciting name in the game, Daniel **Prdk** Predka, is also _extremely_ overdue at this point. Regular appearances on _Darkshire_, _Hoofbeats_ and other household names, a never-ending tour of madness that spanned more than 60 (!) stops just in 2024 alone - but before we get to any of that, let's jump back to 2010.

**1.1. The Aliases Prdkament (2010 - 2018)**  

In the midst of Hockey practice and becoming an actual Yoyo-ing expert, who would actually go on to make it to various competition finals in the future, a young Daniel Predka started dabbling around with music creation software, and around five years later, in 2015, the first of _many_ fruits of his labour dropped online: _Beat #1_. Literally, that's the name. Across 21 whole different, well, beats, he explored the world of HipHop and Trap as **Daniel Predka**, with the occasional detour like the Future Bass-y _THIS IS_, but 2015 held many, _many_ more aliases for us in store. For one, there's the bootlegs of _Katy Perry_ and _MARPO_ that have the name **DVMN** attached. Then there's **Danny Feedex**, which seems to have been an early playground for more electronic bangers, including more in-your-face Trap, Drumstep and with _Places_ even DnB! Then we've got **WRTERE**, which appears on one of his many old SoundCloud accounts a few times but has no further information available, but the most prolific one from that time has got to be **F E R R E T**! 

The following years saw Daniel pursue his musical business mostly through the widely letter spaced alias, going from Ambient and more Beats, over to Future Bass and Trap, until eventually ending up all the way over in the wide worlds of EDM, Synth Pop and, once more, DnB. While he had this cocktail of genres figured out by now, there was still some name changing to be had, and by 2017, he would switch on over to his new **INFINITY WET** alias. A couple of Trap, Beats, Hip Hop and DnB bangers later, he would finally unveil his, for now at least, last alias in 2018: **Prdk**! Still, even with this all-too-familiar name, the early days of the alias consisted of everything from Ambient, like his _2 days after my birthday_ EP, to Synthwave, like his _xox_ EP, and multi-genre Bass music - but the Neuro we have come to expect from him wasn't too far away anymore.
            
**1.2. Getting The Ball Neurolling (2019 - 2025)**  

In fact, it was right around the corner! 2019 saw Daniel put out his very first proper releases as Prdk, from the more dance-y original _Reason_ and his remix of _JOWST_'s _Happier_ all the way to the actual Neuro banger, _Traffic Accident_. Sure, there was the odd Trap remix of a _Gryffin_ tune, some Jump Up on _Click_ and even Liquid and EDM on his _Art Changes Everything_ EP, but other than that, the Neuro was _on_ once 2020 rolled around. Mostly released on his own, but also brought to the masses via the likes of _Bass Rabbit_ and _SubAge_, Daniel slowly but surely showed the world what he is capable of, and with the release of the instantly iconic _Sanctum_ on _Neurofunk, What Else?_ and his winning placement, and subsequent release, in _Hoofbeats_' _Spread The Fire_ remix competition, 2021 truly put him on the map. Not only did he slide onto _my own_ radar, he had also garnered quite the following and thus rightfully earned the _Producer Of The Year_ bronze medal at that year's CZ & SK Bass Awards! 

More and more, Daniel would expand his label rolodex, adding the _Neuroheadz_, _VTO_, _Covet_, _Mindicted_ and _Spring BassJam_ to the ever-growing list, pumping out more instant classics like the ever-present _Pop Dat_, collaborating with _Hoofbeats_' chief of Qoperations himself, and jumping to the very top of the Producer Of The Year list at the Czech- and Slovakian Bass Awards, but the madness that was his 2024 blew all of that out of the water, many times over. Releases on _Hoofbeats_, _Darkshire_, _Neuroheadz_, _Skamele_, _Bass Rabbit_, _Spring BassJam_ and on his own self-release label, countless calamitous collaborations with other Czechian Neuro legends _Symplex_, _Raido_, _Qo_, _Zigi SC_ and _Confusion_, his work being remixed by _Sindicate_, _Montana_, _TR Tactics_, _O&P_, _RAIDO_, _Furious Freaks_ and _Yimura_ and _the_ tune I've heard all over the place in the summer: _RAGGA DAGGA_. Now, as a sort of follow-up to the self-released _SHOCKFEST_ EP said anthem was part of, Daniel returns with a collection of previously unreleased, or at most Patreon-exclusive, dubs so fire, that I simply could not help but spotlight it on here: the **EMPTINESS** EP!

**1.3. EMPTINESS EP**  

We gently glide into this literally massive 10-track EP with the Strobe-ified sequel to the Prdk classic, **Secrets**. Across two and a half minutes of beautifully hype-inducing buildup, Daniel isn't just channeling his inner deadmau5, he also chops up the anthemic vocals into the tiniest of pieces, smashes out all-consuming bass waves, and even fakes us out with another brief 4x4 intermission, before unleashing the full-on Neuro nastiness. Similarly vocal-choppy, but with a tad more newschool techiness, Prdk takes us on a violent ride back and forth between immense distorted basses and fast-paced chopped-up metallic snare madness on **Stop Sign**, before returning to more straight-forward anthemic-vocal Neuro chugginess on **This Feeling**. **Free VIP** sees Daniel return to another classic of his, turning up the insanity of the multi-facetedly vocalised Neuro banger another few notches with another fakeout buildup, before dropping it into the most filthy, steppy, clanky phatness imagineable. 

We remain clonky, with **Haba Daba**'s infectious mix of 2010s Dubstep l4z0rs and metallic as hell snares, and **LMG**'s clinky responses to the straight-up epicness that are the goosebump-inducing calls of bass, before turning up the techiness factor once more, with my favourite of the whole EP, title track **Emptiness**, combining otherworldly choirs, gargantuan Neuro madness and futuristically gated chops into a journey I can't stop replaying. Finally, the last third of this voyage sees Prdk combining Raggae vocal samples and sliced-up choirs with relentlessly chomping ratata's on **Fire Hive**, fusing Synthwave vibes with extra chonky Hardcore influences on weighty **Selecta**, and letting loose even more pounding 4x4 beats and Hardcore kicks on the Skrillex sample featuring and incredibly your-face-in-smashing finale **WTFOMG**. 

**1.4. Conclusion**  

Contrary to its name, chock-full of wonderful melodic influences from all sorts of unexpected places beautifully interwoven with the face-melting, brain-rewiring madness we've come to expect from the Czechian talent - not to mention it's free!

####**2. Xeonz - Eden EP [The North Quarter]**  
*Recommended if you like: Submorphics, Styke, Invadhertz*  

Speaking of about damn time, let's finally talk about **Xeonz**! 

**2.1. Jameandering Through The Genres (2012 - 2019)**  

It's not even that much of a rarity for someone to have dabbled in the dark arts of EDM before finding their footing in our genre, but I was still surprised to see the levels of success Jamie Dixon, the Guildfordian man behind the **Xeonz** project, had reached in these ""before times"". For instance, in 2015, just three years after starting to produce, Jamie already had started building up a discography of Future House bangers like _Never_, _Weak_ or _Dance With Me_ that would go on to amass _hundred of thousands_ of streams on SoundCloud, releasing on platforms like _Fated_, _Imminent_ and _Outertone_. 

Not content with the, admittedly, rather stale sound in this very specific genre, Jamie made the switch to something way more in line with where he comes from: UK Bassline! Well, and Bass House. Okay, and Electro House. Whether on bootlegs for _B Young_, _My Nu Leng_, or _Lil Pump_, on his contribution to _WATEVA_'s remix competition, or on his originals, you would always be met with something rather groovy and cheeky. Not only did that garner him his first festival booking at _Bassfest_, he also became quite the regular on the one and only _Crucast_, starting with one-off free downloads, leading to compilation entries, until eventually earning himself a full-on EP to go wild on! While that EP, or more specifically the Electro House banger _Jackpot_, landed him a UKF red channel upload, he was once again ready to switch lanes. 

**2.2. Ghosts'n'bass (2019 - 2025)**  

Lucky for us, that lane was DnB! What began with the 2018 heavy-hitter _Dimension_ on _Breeze_, soon landed him on none other than RAM's up-and-comer sister label _ProgRAM_, Macky Gee's _Down 2 Earth_, scene monopolist _DnB Allstars_ and Neurofunk forge _Blackout Music_. As you can perhaps tell, Jamie's incredible futuristic approach to DnB caught the attention of quite a few, usually vastly different imprints and brought out some of my favourite pieces of his music, but if I've learned anything from covering him on here, it's that things won't last forever. While he was still busy with his studies, he had started venturing out of this niche once again, with Future Garage experiments like _Wavelength_ or with his work as a Sound Designer for unofficial Elder Scrolls expansion pack _Beyond Skyrim_, but 2022 already saw him coming back into the DnB world. Just, more liquid-y. 

On his _Surveillance_ EP _Talk To Me_, he showcased his unique fusion of the techy and the vibey, before going even further down the liquid rabbit hole with more splendid lushness on _Pilot_ and _Vandal_ - and then came his deep arc. After his murky contributions to _MODUS_' _Modules_ and _Overview_'s _Zone 3_ compilations, he would return to Camo & Krooked & Mefjus' label with a full-fledged EP, full of technically extravagant yet heavy deep and darkness and collaborations with _VISLA_ and _SMG_. All that, while teaching the next generation with 1:1 sessions amongst all sorts of helpful Patreon content and apparently ghost-producing for a whole heap of people all over the place. No wonder he was namedropped in UKF's _ONES TO WATCH_ late last year!

Now, he's already firmly back in the liquid saddle again, once again going from compilation entry to solo EP, this time on none other than Lenzman's **The North Quarter**! 

**2.3. New Eden EP**  

We step into this New and improved garden Eden, with shiny escalators instead of stuffy trees, where EP opener and NQ State Of Mind fragment **Without You** awaits us. Soft think breaks and dreamy synths open up this retrofuturistic world, modeled after the ambience of Jamie's favourite game _Mirrors Edge_, and with a most lovely vocal sample, we roll into the amalgation of warm basses, tight yet easy-going drums, more synths and reverberated everythings that is the drop. We continue exploring this mall of the future with the even more relaxing atmosphere, soft yet snappy drums and _lush_ organ-esque chords of **Your Life**. That water droplet sound switchup of the chords halfway through, the little harp signaling the beginning of the end of the drop, those little vocal snippets - delightful!

On stop three, **Feel Right**, we catch even more of a glimpse at the world outside of 80s synthesizers with some guitar strumming, subtle bass guitar riffs and even some pianos, but soon enough, we slide right back into synth heaven, with plucks so rich in colour and so widely stretched that it feels like we're gently drifting through the clouds above the glassy city. EP closer **Falling**'s simulated bird chirps awaken us one last time, just in time for **Luke Truth**, who you might know from his, like, dozens of lovely features in recent times, to serenade us. Gliding through the thick haze of warm basses and subtle synths with only mister Truth and the precise drums keeping us company, we experience more and more little glitches in the system, bleeps and bloops peeking through the clouds and tiny sharp edges in between the cushy vibes, but luckily, we stick the landing and roll everything out smoothly.

**2.4. Conclusion**  

Perfectly crafted retrofuturistic atmospheres, synths unlike any other, vibes in superabundance - Xe really is one of the bestz. 

Other liquid from this week:  
- Hybrid Minds, Ashley Singh - Lonely Love  
- ALB - Cold Hearted  
- Galacy - Voices LP  
- Surreal - Paradise EP  
- Leniz - Declare Peace EP

I’m enjoying my NY Breakfast Sandwich and black coffee at the Lincoln Center fountain. As soon as I finish I will be heading to Maximo and Luisa’s photo shoot.

What a glorious weekend. How much I love Kitten and my crazy, unique family! On Friday afterschool Kitten and I did “Songs from South Pacific” for the Early Bird Dinner at Jammy’s restaurant. One of the clients invited us to perform at a party next Saturday night she is sponsoring for her friends. Kitten had done this once before and said it is so much fun and pays well.

On Saturday I watched Jammy’s rehearsal with Ms. Stacey. “What am I going to remind you girls of?” she asked. The answers: chew gum, enjoy ourselves, dynamics, keep pushing the beat (Alice and Jean), don’t hold my sticks so tightly (Alice), hit all 88 keys and open my chest (Kitten), don’t look at my left hand (June), etc. 

They did Cole Porter’s “You Do Something to Me.” I thought it was excellent! But then Ms. Stacey said that she had a surprise for everyone and brought out sleep masks. “Put them on and do the song again!” Everyone was dumbfounded but played the song—pretty weakly. Ms. Stacey told them to try again. This time it was exceptionally beyond excellent. They did the rest of their songs “blind” and I could hear them hearing each other and going to absolutely new places!!! OMG!

At the end of the rehearsal Ms. Stacey told them that her student teaching at the school finishes with the spring vacation. She then moves to student teaching at a middle school to fulfill the requirements for her license. It was bitter sweet.

We then went to the ACS center. The Jammy Girls have built such strong friendships with the middle school girls. Until the new instruments come in, they have to share. But they are actually playing rock!

It was good to see Mrs. Coleman and Mrs. Joseph again. They are so pleased with the program with Jammy. They asked me how my roadtrip and college studies are going. They remarked how unbelievable it now seems that this all started from investigating a series of anonymous child abuse and neglect complaints (that continue to this day) and which they now just ignore. My job was to discuss where they could safely store the instruments and equipment that will soon be arriving. I talked to them about finding a bigger rehearsal site but they said let’s keep it here for this year and then discuss.

*(A sidebar. Kitten asked me point blank whether it was me who had made that anonymous $5K contribution to the instrument fund. I had rehearsed my answer in my mind. “I will not confirm or deny it,” was all that I said. Hahaha.)*

We went home and the Fam went out to this amazing Italian restaurant called Pasta Pasta. After gorging ourselves, we went home, sat on the sofa, put up our feet and watched TV. We watched this cute but inconsequential Netflix movie “La Dolce Villa” about an American girl and her father who purchase a “1 Euro” home in an isolated Italian village that is trying to reinvent itself. Of course, everyone falls in and out and back in love, people learn about themselves and stretch, and the countryside is gorgeous. I caught Mom and Muma cuddling together on the couch. Does that mean…??? I caught their eyes and they glared back a “don’t even think what you are thinking!” look. Who knows, maybe it’s the start.

Yesterday we met up at the bagel shop with the Lopez and Yao families. Cardi looks, as Charlotte in Charlotte’s Web says, “RESPLENDENT”! ""Robert this, and Robert that; Yiddish this, and Yiddish that."" And I am pretty sure I saw Junior and Sopie holding hands under the table and blushing when they caught me looking at them!

At the HS Div meeting we read a guidance from Sensei about how unshakable Mt. Fuji is because of its vast foundation. We talked about getting swayed by something called “the eight winds.” My friends shared a lot of funny stories about getting swayed. Our leaders encouraged us to develop our faith, practice, and study—our foundation—because obstacles will occur again and again. We should be like Mt. Fuji and be unshakable when the winds hit us.

We said goodbye to the Yao’s and Lopez’s and ate at a Japanese restaurant near the Culture Center. This is a very good restaurant for sushi and I had a Chirashi bowl with some exotic sashimi pieces.

Back home and we watched the latest episodes of *1923* and Kathy Bates’ *Matlock.* Kitten and I were tired from the changing of the clocks so we went to bed early. I fell asleep in her arms and the world is grand.

There are so many things to be grateful for in this world and counting my blessings in moments of hopelessness has helped me immensely in easing the pain of rejection and lovesickness. 

And when I say “count your blessings” I mean literally make a list and take action to show gratitude for those things. Lots of people like to always say “be grateful” but never really explain how to…

Follow this list up with ACTS of GENEROSITY. It is the biggest way to not only show loved ones you appreciate them but also to remind YOURSELF you appreciate them. This WILL give you a sense of gratefulness. It is so so easy to let the things you don’t have cloud the things you do but you can part those clouds by showing gratitude in action. 

This can even work for inanimate objects too like for example, if you are reading this on Reddit lovesick in your dirty room, show appreciation and gratefulness for even having a room of your own in the first place by generously giving your time to clean it. 

Show appreciation for your health by working out or simply remembering to eat some food today. Feeling physically healthy will GREATLY increase your chances of feeling mentally healthy. WORK OUT you WILL feel better I guarantee it. 

Having appreciation for something will compel you to commit acts of love and generosity towards that thing by volunteering your time to it. The more time you give, the more appreciation you will have. (Here’s a simple example from myself: I’ve started cleaning/polishing my record collection again and it has given me greater joy in listening to them afterwards.)

So if you’re feeling down right now reading this, go buy your friend a coffee or tell your parents you love them or go dust that nightstand off already! (That one’s a personal one I’m still procrastinating on). And do it all GRACIOUSLY. 

Did this make sense? I will also be honest, I still feel down lots of the time. Negative feelings will never go away after all it’s impossible to be completely numb no matter how much we wish we could be. But even writing this post out and giving my time to add something helpful to this subreddit has already rid me of my sick stomach.

Lastly, I feel compelled to say this reminder was given to me a few weeks ago during a Bible study on Sunday and as a Christian man I’m just grateful to God who watches over me and loves me. (Hopefully I don’t lose anyone at the end with this preachy closure but it’s an appreciation I want to make known!)

Ok that’s all bye.

For the last 6-8 weeks I have not been given my full 20 hours and have been told time and time again that 10% under contract is allowed, however I’m consistently only getting between 16-17 hours which is more than 10%.
