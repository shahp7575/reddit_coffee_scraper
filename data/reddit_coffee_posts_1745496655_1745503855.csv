1k6t5lj,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1k6t5lj/entry_level_espresso_setup_for_someone_who_is/,Entry level espresso setup for someone who is familiar with brewing coffee [500$-1500$],"While I have coffee brewing as a hobby that I enjoy on the side, I have joined a local training center that teaches how to be a barista professionally from prepping your espresso shot to milk frothing, latte art, and mixing syrups with your shot so for the past couple days I have been learning how to do shots with a trainer

I don‚Äôt have plans to start my own cafe but I want to make a proper home setup, I plan on developing an application related to coffee and everything I am learning will be reflected on it like I know how to brew V60, Chemex, French Press, Aeropress, and much more so I know the entire procedure of what beans are needed and what grinder to get (tho suggestions are welcomed)

I have been eyeing my eye on the Sage Touch Impress or Sage Barista Express Impress since they offer an entire setup all in one (machine + grinder and I found out that the grinder is updated version from Baratza) but for a less price point I can get a Baratza grinder and a Sage/Breville Bambino or a Gaggia Classic Pro (some suggested to get mods for it since it lacks certain features)

A friend of mine who is a barista suggested to get a cheap machine as a starting point to try and mess around with it then once it breaks or stops working then I can upgrade to a proper machine so found a german espresso machine near me with no name but comes with a build in grinder, 58 portafilter, wand, milk pitcher, tamper for like 250$ (https://www.eurotradelb.com/products/elk201cs)

Suggestions are welcome, I don‚Äôt mind paying for something that would last for a long time but I don‚Äôt want to pay for something that I can yield better quality for less money and if you agree with my friend‚Äôs suggestion to get the cheap one to mess with then upgrade",1,1745503728.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

My sister in law was back from dropping my brother off at work so I was sitting in their vehicle with her having some coffee and chilling. A woman, younger,  stood behind the vehicle staring into the ditch and staring at us. She walked over to the side street, looking into our yard and back yard. I mean she was just standing there and looking.  We asked her, what was up, if she was good and she asked to use our phone and we said no, we don't have a phone. She then asked us to call her number and we replied that we couldn't help, bc the whole situation just seemed off. She walked down the side street and stopped and is just looking into our back yard. We went into our back yard and she was still just starring in our back yard. She walked down a little more and then a black Chevy stopped and she got in with a black male.

1k6t4h9,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1k6t4h9/my_shot_consistency_has_improved_drastically/,My shot consistency has improved drastically since I stopped WDT,"Some background: I have a Micra so no pressure profiling or pre-infusion, flat 9 bar.  Grinder is a Niche Zero.  No RDT.  I use mostly medium roast beans freshly roasted from local and online specialty shops.  

I have used WDT since I started.  I was using a basic normcore needle tool.  I was getting reasonably consistent shots, but would sometimes run into these patches of inconsistency, usually when switching beans, dialing in a new bag, or as a bag would age.  By inconsistency, I mean the shot would pull unevenly leaving residue on one side of the PF, and timings would vary more than a little.  

At first, I figured I wasn't doing it vigorously enough.  I didn't have a PF funnel so I was stirring delicately to keep the grounds in the PF.  So I picked one up and started really taking the time to get the ground coffee stirred well.  Then I would use a leveler, then tamp.  This looked like it should work well.  The distribution looked perfect.  But it really only made it more inconsistent.  I was getting frustrated. I figured if this is how its going to be, Im done with WDT. Im just going to smooth it out with a finger, level and tamp.  After dialing in a bit with the new workflow, I was kind of shocked to find out that my shots pull perfectly now.  Completely even water distribution, no residue, consistent timings.  

As far as taste, I mostly make milk drinks, but when I first make workflow changes, I always taste shots.  Taste was never really that variable, unless I was at the extremes of timing (ie way too short or long).  Taste using this new method is as good as ever and no issues that my palate can detect.  

My theory on what is happening here is that I have traded extraction efficiency for consistency.  I did notice a slight trend in coarser grinding since dialing in this new workflow.  I believe when I was using WDT, I was putting the finer grounds in a state where more could be extracted, but even slight issues with the distribution would cause unevenness and inconsistency.  With a slightly coarser grind, less can be extracted, but water can makes its way more evenly though the puck.  This is a trade off I am perfectly happy to accept.  Again, taste is as good as ever and every shot now pulls perfectly every time.  Its been 4+ weeks since I made this change, and the consistency has held though multiple bags and multiple different beans.

Do what you will with this information.  I want to put it out there because it seems like the only advice is to make workflow more complicated chasing perfection.  But for real people like me who just want a consistent afternoon latte, a simpler method has solved all my problems and frustrations.",1,1745503653.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

- Doctor said I had a lot of gallstones. He said my liver is enlarged (which I‚Äôve known) but it looks fine so he didn‚Äôt do a biopsy. I also got an upper endoscopy done for my heartburn and he did 3 stomach biopsies. This only took an hour.
- My upper right quadrant is sore; it feels like a did a million sit ups in that area alone. lol
- I can get around fine but I just can‚Äôt bend over very much. 
- Doctor prescribed me oxycodone and methocarbamol, and told me I can rotate between Advil and Tylenol. I‚Äôm really just relying on the methocarbamol and Advil. I‚Äôm trying to avoid the oxy unless the pain gets very bad.
- It hurts to cough, sneeze, and change positions in bed. other than that, the pain isn‚Äôt that bad! I‚Äôm getting around perfectly fine.
- Doctor gave me a week off of work. He told me after 2 weeks I can get back to working out but can‚Äôt lift anything heavier than 15 pounds. 

I do have one concern though:
I‚Äôm worried about my bowel movements‚Ä¶ I was told that I‚Äôd have diarrhea as my digestive system adjusts. Yesterday I ate only bland foods (scrambled eggs, saltine crackers, graham crackers). I haven‚Äôt had any bowel movements yet. I feel some gas bubbles but I‚Äôm not 100% sure if it‚Äôs the C02 or gas. Doctor told me to call him if I haven‚Äôt had a bowel movement in 3 days‚Ä¶ I decided since the bland diet went well yesterday I‚Äôll go back to a regular diet today. So I‚Äôm drinking coffee now and hoping for the best lmao iykyk.

*So she flew, together with her pink friend. Was it a flight of choice? Not by any means. The bright blue sky was a welcome distraction from the blue below she was sinking ever near. Those metaphorical wings at her sides all but faded as her lavender hair met the deep blue, the ocean sucking her into its gaping nothingness.*

*Was her heartbeat picking up, or slowing? Were her eyes screwed shut, or was the ocean as deep and dark as the back of her eyelids? The lavender one could do nothing but hold her breath. She could not swim. She couldn‚Äôt bring herself to move. So she sank. This is how she died. Her biggest fear swallowing her whole. Not the most unfitting.*

*A hand met hers just then, fussing with the stiffness. Suddenly, the heaviness of the ocean pulling down on her faded, and she was hoisted up, the ocean‚Äôs victim no more‚Ä¶*

Yuri opened her eyes, blinded by the sun peeking through the cloudy sky. She tried to exhale, but water came out. She coughed and coughed, her chest aching as her hands gripped the sand futilely. When it subsided, Natsuki appeared in her view, face fixed in worry.

‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù she said.

Yuri couldn‚Äôt bring herself to sit up. If anything, the thought of being high up there, nearly touching the clouds, was more inviting than the alternate blue, the one she could hear not too far away. But she had to sit up. Something had happened, and now the Literature Club was all split up. Just like an adventure to split them up.

She sat weakly. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mention it. Ridiculous we had to get launched this far, not to mention that we had to land in the water.‚Äù It was a good thing these weren‚Äôt their only uniforms. Natsuki fussed with hers, the tie drooping sadly.

‚ÄúNo kidding,‚Äù Yuri breathed.

It must have been a decent sized explosion to launch them from a wormhole in the center of the forest all the way to Akemi Beach. Yuri forced herself not to look at the water. It was enough that her uniform was completely soaked. Was she shivering from the coldness, or was it something else?

‚ÄúYuri,‚Äù Nat said, ‚ÄúYou sure you‚Äôre okay? You‚Äôre so pale.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrying‚Ä¶‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúHere, can you walk?‚Äù

‚ÄúMhm‚Ä¶‚Äù Nat took Yuri‚Äôs hand and they moved away from the water, near the foot of the forest. Funny, this was how the Chest of Chib got opened the first time. It‚Äôs a shame there was no Suki to bring closure to this situation quickly. That massive chibi‚Ä¶ How did she get like that, and did it have anything to do with that massive console replica in the distance? Did *that* have anything to do with the console being strange?

‚ÄúThere, we‚Äôre away from the water,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúThank you‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy um‚Ä¶ are you afraid of it, if I could ask.‚Äù Seeing Yuri look away, she clarified, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to answer, I‚Äôm just curious. If it‚Äôs something uncomfortable‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, nothing like that,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúIt was before I moved from Taito. Mmm‚Ä¶‚Äù

Yuri told her. When she was done, Nat leaned back. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs crazy. So that‚Äôs what you were scared to tell me during our Road Trip? Wow, going through that, then having to move right afterwards without getting to resolve it‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Yuri.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are the last person who needs to be. Sometimes people are perplexing. There is no one size fits all for how we work. I‚Äôve certainly learned that being in the club, aha‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù

‚ÄúTh-that wasn‚Äôt a jab at you‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, I‚Äôm just teasing. Trying to lighten the mood in spite of all this.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù

‚ÄúSpeaking of all this‚Ä¶‚Äù Nat faced the sky, directly above the forest. A gaping hole had formed, leading directly back to the Inner Code. Yuri eyes it cautiously, as though everything evil in the world was about to come shooting out of there without warning. But it was not to be. From the looks of it, Natalie, the big chibi, was camping there. ‚ÄúHow are we supposed to get back up there?‚Äù Nat asked.

A great question indeed‚Ä¶

MEANWHILE‚Ä¶
~~~
He awoke to the back of his head throbbing rhythmically. First the sea of green and now he was eyeing the sea of blue that was the sky, the normal sky. Was it all a bad dream? If it wasn‚Äôt, was Sayori okay?

‚ÄúMC! Wake up!‚Äù Sayori blurted. That answered his question.

He groggily sat up, Sayori sitting not too far away, worry fixed on her face. Well, here he was. What he and Monika spoke of not a few minutes ago could be tested here, if he really wanted to. Part of him wished this was just a dream, but clearly it wasn‚Äôt; otherwise below him would be the comforting covers of his bedroom, not the concrete-y pathway that belonged to‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ where was he? He looked around. Behind Sayori were two pools, a falsely old bridge set between them. Behind, a giant ferris wheel stood imposed. Not far from that, a rollercoaster. *Oh.* He breathed. Well, at least he knew where he was.

‚ÄúNot the best place for a nap,‚Äù he lamented.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt scare me like that!‚Äù she went to fling her arms around him, but he leaned away, causing her to sink limply, her frown still there. She looked at him, confused. ‚Äú...What‚Äôs the matter?‚Äù

How in any universe could he possibly answer that? What could he say? He didn‚Äôt understand how Sayori did it. How could anyone just bounce back from something like that?  He couldn‚Äôt understand why she was so patient. She‚Äôd held those thoughts of him for what, any number of years, and he was too oblivious to even bat an eye? How could someone bounce back from such an embarrassing set of events‚Ä¶?

He refused to bat an eye at her, even now. Every time he saw her face, it just reminded him further of that night. Did she hold malice toward him? There were too many things he couldn‚Äôt know, that he wanted to ask, but at the same time he only had himself preventing him from doing so.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot I could say,‚Äù he said, only realizing then that he was working with his throat in a knot. Were those tears welling up? 

Sayori sidled in his view, her eyes glossy. ‚ÄúMC‚Ä¶ Monika told me some things. About how you think I feel‚Ä¶‚Äù

For a moment, he was startled. But it wasn‚Äôt untrue. That conversation earlier wasn‚Äôt the first. It was just the first time he shared the details. Part of him still wondered if it was the right call.

‚ÄúDid she now‚Ä¶‚Äù he murmured.

‚ÄúMC please‚Äî I don‚Äôt hold anything against you, you know I wouldn‚Äôt lie.‚Äù

He sank. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a matter of what you think. It‚Äôs me. It‚Äôs always been me. And‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs not an easy way I can fix this‚Ä¶‚Äù he gestured to his head, to the evil thing that was his brain. His eyes were only getting cloudier with tears.

‚ÄúPl-please don‚Äôt cry‚Ä¶‚Äù

Not that there was a way to stop it. As the first tear rolled down his cheek, Sayori wrapped him in a tight embrace. There was no backing away this time. He didn‚Äôt fight it, but‚Ä¶ He didn‚Äôt really feel it fair to hug back. Unfortunately, her warmth wasn‚Äôt helping his resistance‚Ä¶ Why did he have to be so reserved at a time like this?

‚ÄúEveryone deals differently,‚Äù she whispered, ‚ÄúAs the Literature Club found its footing, I learned that real quick. I won‚Äôt force that night on you anymore. You can approach me whenever you‚Äôre ready. But‚Ä¶ above all else, please don‚Äôt think I hate you. Please‚Ä¶‚Äù

At that, the dam broke. Tears waterfalled out, no matter how hard he tried to fight them. He knew Sayori was trying her damndest to stay calm, too. Still, he couldn‚Äôt bring himself to hug back. He was stuck there, a limbo between his wishes and the foils of his brain. Both sides pulled at him, and all that could result were tears. No movement, no nothing. Yet despite it all, she never faltered. He knew full well she would sit here with him in her arms for as long as it took to stop the tears. Even despite his faults, she still loved him through and through. MC clenched his fists. He was doing it again. Even now. Even knowing how she felt. Why couldn‚Äôt he let himself live?

Perhaps a more external answer to that question was approaching. A thousand small scuttling steps echoed from behind, forcing them out of the moment. Looking back, he saw exactly what he didn‚Äôt want to see again. The giant horde of evil Chibis hadn‚Äôt been fought off by Yuri‚Äôs group or Sunyori. They were still very much around.

He eyed Sayori, then them, then Sayori again. ‚ÄúDo you have any ideas?‚Äù

Sayori pouted. ‚ÄúWow. Such meanies, we were in the middle of something.‚Äù

‚ÄúHeh‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course I have a way.‚Äù Sayori produced a cookie from her blazer pocket. Before he could ask, one bite and suddenly her hair had turned that gold that it was during the end of summer. *So that‚Äôs how she got that way.* She floated upward, then snapped a finger. ‚ÄúBrace yourself!‚Äù

Suddenly, with a glowy aura, he was airborne with her. But the Sukimores weren‚Äôt stupid. One by one they stood atop each other, until their tower was just a hop away from reaching him. ‚ÄúUm, a little faster?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo worries!‚Äù She zoomed on, toward the entrance of Akemi Point but veered a little out of the way, to a certain building. ‚ÄúNow that we‚Äôre here, and I have the power, maybe it‚Äôs time we see what artifact those two were after‚Ä¶‚Äù

Now far from the Sukimores for now, Sayori brought them back down, and together they stood before the entrance of Chibi Deserts.

ELSEWHERE‚Ä¶
~~~
‚ÄúAt least we know what the anomaly is,‚Äù Monika said.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Sunyori floated ahead, ‚ÄúBut without ordinary console actions, we can‚Äôt quickly scale the Inner Code.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs sucky,‚Äù Michi sighed, ‚ÄúSucky too that Natalie thinks this is how that plan should be carried out. Putting wrenches in key system processes doesn‚Äôt make our escape to other worlds any easier.‚Äù

The wind gushed, the grass fluttering against the thousand little houses across the reserves.

‚ÄúWhatever happened between you and your underlings after that, Michi?‚Äù Monika asked.

Michi gave a guilty glance at Sunyori, who looked poised to dash after her again. ‚ÄúI um‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt want to talk about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I thought,‚Äù Sunyori smirked.

‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶‚Äù Monika brushed it off. ‚ÄúAnyways, that blast actually put us in a pretty good position. We‚Äôve still got to find the rest of the club, but for now, there‚Äôs some people here we could call upon for help.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh huh‚Ä¶‚Äù Michi suddenly hid behind Monika.

‚ÄúWh-what, what is it?‚Äù Monika said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd just recommend YOU call upon them. Not me.‚Äù

‚ÄúGuilty to the very end, huh?‚Äù Sunyori spouted.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that!‚Äù

Monika giggled. At least they could make a relatively gloomy situation a lighter one. Who better to do that than a chibi with the actual power of the sun itself? They finally approached the familiar red roofed house. Without Michi around here as often, she wondered who officially had ownership of it.

‚ÄúChiba! Yua! Are you there?‚Äù

Michi tucked herself behind Monika even farther. Soon after that, the door swung open, and the mismatch eyed chibis emerged with smiles.

‚ÄúMonika!‚Äù Yua said. ‚ÄúAnd‚Ä¶‚Äù

Chiba immediately stiffened, bowing. ‚Äúgod sunyori.‚Äù

Sunyori backed away. ‚ÄúH-hey now, you don‚Äôt have to be so formal to me.‚Äù

Chiba pepped up. ‚Äúits an honor to meet you in person!!!!‚Äù she said. ‚Äúand it's good to see you again, monik‚Ä¶a‚Ä¶ who‚Äôs that behind you?‚Äù

Monika cracked a grin, sidling out of the way to reveal Michi red handed.

The mood of the chibi sisters soured immediately. ‚ÄúYou!‚Äù they said in unison.

Michi shook. ‚ÄúH-hey, you two. Um‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no hard feelings between us, right?‚Äù

‚Äúlike hell theres not!‚Äù chiba screamed, ‚Äúyou ransacked the inner code and made both of us fear for our life!‚Äù she eyed behind Monika, at the gaping wormhole right above Akemi Forest. ‚Äúand that, is that your doing too!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo! It‚Äôs not me, it‚Äôs one of my stupid underlings!‚Äù

‚Äúand now you call one of your own stupid? do you have a backstabbing kink or som-‚Äù

‚ÄúChiba, settle down,‚Äù Yua said. ‚ÄúYou know how she is. If she really were up to something, why would she have come to the trouble of greeting us here. In person?‚Äù

‚Äúmmm‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄúShe is right, Chiba,‚Äù Sunyori said, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs on equal ground with us. We‚Äôve got a situation, as you‚Äôve gathered. One of Michi‚Äôs underlings has blocked the system‚Äôs method of transmitting images from this world. We know it‚Äôs not much, but we were wondering if you two would want to help us?‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶‚Äù Yua frowned, ‚ÄúSorry, we have our hands full ourselves. Now isn‚Äôt quite a good time.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, okay,‚Äù Monika smiled, ‚ÄúNo worries.‚Äù

‚Äúthanks. maybe sometime we‚Äôll give y‚Äôall a visit just out of the blue!‚Äù Chiba said.

‚ÄúThat would be great!‚Äù Monika said. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôll leave you two to your devices!‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks, we‚Äôll see you soon.‚Äù Yua said. And then the two vanished back into the house.

The three huddled together.

‚ÄúPhew,‚Äù Michi huffed.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome,‚Äù Monika winked.

‚ÄúNo thank you!‚Äù she snapped, ‚ÄúThat was demoralizing!‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do you think MC felt when you yelled at him?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Ä¶ okay, fair.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnyway, you two, since at this hour most Chibis are out or are preoccupied, I think I know another place where we could call upon someone for help,‚Äù Sunyori said, ‚ÄúFollow me.‚Äù

So they trailed her out of the reserves, back into the edge of the forest. They didn‚Äôt make it far before Sunyori stopped, emphasizing a specific point between the trees. She tapped the ground. ‚ÄúRight here.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶?‚Äù

Sunyori knocked again. ‚ÄúHello? Mocha! We need your help!‚Äù

Monika and Michi sat back, eyebrows raised, when suddenly the ground opened slowly and mechanically. It was a hidden hatch all along. And out came a mysterious chibi, hair and eyes the color of creamed coffee. She gazed up at them, and smiled. ‚ÄúWell well, Monika. I‚Äôve been told a lot about you. Come on in!‚Äù

1k6t2qq,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1k6t2qq/my_father_was_a_mystery_writer/,My father was a mystery writer,"**My father was a mystery writer. A few months after his death, I found a notebook containing a bunch of murder stories that he never published. After reading a few of them, I‚Äôm convinced he wasn‚Äôt who I thought he was.**



My father and I never had the best relationship. He was always very distant when I was growing up, and he never made any effort to bond with me, despite our shared interests. Like him, I was a book enthusiast and particularly enjoyed true crime and mystery novels. Whenever I tried to talk to him about it, however, he simply brushed me off and ignored me. My mother, may she rest in peace, died in labor, so it was just the two of us. Although he wasn‚Äôt an emotionally available parent, I never lacked anything, and he even paid for my college expenses.¬†

Over the years, I started to care less about him, and we eventually stopped talking. I moved out in my final year of university and moved in with my then-girlfriend, now wife.¬†

We married three years ago in a beautiful church and had a lovely wedding, for which my father wasn‚Äôt present, since he never even replied to our invitation. Six months later, I got a call from my hometown‚Äôs hospital letting me know that my father had died from a heart attack. I wasn‚Äôt as sad or angry as I should have been, but you have to understand, the man was a stranger. I didn‚Äôt even know any of his colleagues, his tastes, his opinions, or anything about him for that matter.¬†

I didn‚Äôt organize a funeral because I genuinely didn‚Äôt know who to invite other than me and my wife. I just had him incinerated and spread his ashes in our backyard without thinking too much of it.¬†

Although my wife wanted to get to it straight away, I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to go through his things until a couple of months after he died. He had left everything to me, and I wasn‚Äôt up for going through his belongings. Two months after his death, I traveled back to my hometown and started sorting through his things. Most of what I found were old notebooks, unfinished stories, and other bits and bobs that didn‚Äôt hold any importance to me. I threw everything away as soon as I had finished going through it.¬†

While I was going through his story notebooks, I found one that caught my eye. It was a very old notebook, with coffee stains and ink spills all over it. It was titled- Murders.¬†

At first, I dismissed it as one of my father‚Äôs idea-compilation diaries, of which he had plenty.¬†

I started reading the first entry, which stated the following;

*March 29th, 1982- Lisa Mccartney*

*He decided to do it. He had thought about it for months and had spent weeks planning everything to not get caught. He knew who, when, and how. He didn‚Äôt know why.¬† She was walking back home after a party. She was drunk and stumbling. He offered her a ride, and she didn‚Äôt hesitate. He drove to the lake and strangled her using a shoelace. He then dragged her body to the shore, put rocks inside her jeans, and threw her inside the lake.*¬†

The story didn‚Äôt particularly stand out. It was a good idea for a short story, which my dad was proficient in. Two of his best-selling books were short murder story compilations. The story itself sounded familiar, but I shrugged it off thinking it was a story he‚Äôd told me before going to bed. Those were the only moments in which he paid attention to me, and I cherished those minutes before going to sleep, as they were the sole evidence that I had of my father loving me.¬†

I read the second one;

*June 7th, 1982- Josie Anderson*

*This time, he didn‚Äôt need as much planning. The first time had turned out so well, that he had been living off the adrenaline for months. But that exhilarating feeling was fading, and he needed more. He wanted to feel the thrill he so dearly missed.*¬†

*He left late at night. He followed the same ritual as the first time. Picked up a drunk girl, offered her a ride home, strangled her with a shoelace, and threw her in the lake. The cops still hadn't found Lisa, so it was a safe place.*¬†

The stories were starting to creep me out, but I again brushed it off as the product of my father‚Äôs mysterious and weird mind. I read some more stories and memorized some names that sounded familiar. *Mary Strauss, Noah Archer, Kate Parker, Susan Malone, Matilda Kennedy‚Ä¶* For some reason, these names particularly stood out to me.¬†

It was then that it hit me. I quickly googled Matilda‚Äôs name, and the date next to it was September 21st, 1991. A news article popped up, and my heart stopped.¬†

‚Äú*Yet another disappearance in Delburn. Matilda Kennedy marks the 40th missing teenager.*‚Äù

I realized why all of those names sounded familiar. They were the names of the Delburn 40, the girls who had mysteriously disappeared for years during the 1980s and early 1990s, never to be seen again. I was petrified and shocked. I realized that there was only one entry left.¬†

I was confused because, according to town history, only 40 girls had gone missing since the disappearances stopped after Matilda Kennedy.¬†

I continued reading until I noticed a date that sent chills down my spine. *January 14th, 1992- Marianne Nelson*

It was the day before my birthday. And it was my mother‚Äôs name.

*January 14th, 1992- Marianne Nelson*

*She was different. He knew because he had noticed her before. She and her useless boyfriend walked past his house every day. She could do so much better. She could be with someone like him. They had moved three months earlier, and she was pregnant with her first child. He tried to resist the urge, he swore. But he couldn't. He offered her a ride home one at night when she was coming out of the grocery store. She had run out of eggs, she said, and had decided to walk, since it was only ten minutes away. He insisted on driving her, telling her that it was late and that she was too pregnant to be walking anywhere. She accepted and got into his car.*¬†

*He drove to the lake. He strangled her. And as he was dragging her body to the water, he noticed her belly moving. The baby was still alive. He doesn‚Äôt know why he did what he did. He grabbed his Swiss Army knife and cut into her stomach. He pulled the baby out and wiped his face. The baby cried. He cried. He finished dragging the body into the lake, drove back home, and packed a suitcase. He left in the middle of the night and moved to Tennessee. He got a job as an electrician and told everyone that his wife had died during childbirth. Five years later, he returned to Dalburn and told the same story. No one ever questioned him.*¬†

I finished reading the entry and fainted.¬†

When I woke up, my wife was next to me and asked me what had happened. I told her it was nothing and asked if we could go home.¬†

She reluctantly agreed and tried to get me to tell her during the car ride, but I didn‚Äôt utter a word. My entire life was a lie. The man I thought was my father was a murderer. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep for a few days. Should I go to the police? Should I find my real dad? Please advise me on what I should do.¬†

27M
- ive been raped multiple times 

- bullied into my adult life

- used to be engaged 

- I‚Äôm a functioning drug addict (by functioning, I mean I have a 10th story studio overlooking one of the best American cities, save money, I take care of myself on all levels minus drugs) 

- I have traveled the world on my own (and with my own money, none of that mommy and daddy stuff)

- I‚Äôve lived all over the world

- I graduated college with a bachelors

- I was a high school history teacher for over 2 years (22-24) and I STILL HAVE STUDENTS THANKING ME FOR CHANGING THEIR LIVES 5+ years later. How many sorry haters can say they changed lives and Inspired knowledge in others? NOT MANY OF YOU and I was LOVED BY ALL EXCEPT MY HATING ALL COLLEAGUES. The principal spent the last year pushing me out JUST SO HE COULD TAKE MY ROLE AND MADE ME FEEL LIKE A HORRIBLE TEACHER. His pathetic ass didn‚Äôt even make it a few months, the school wasn‚Äôt dumb, I TRULY LOVED ALL MY CHILDREN AS IF THEY WERE MY OWN AND THEY DARED THROW UNSPEAKABLE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST ME. Note, NONE OF MY KIDS OR PARENTS THOUGHT THIS, I was the only Afro-Hispanic teacher in my school and the students, according to one teacher who wasn‚Äôt even lying said that ‚ÄúTHEY WORSHIPPED ME‚Äù 

- no criminal record 

- I cook my own meals from scratch 

- I‚Äôm very feminine (which people
Have hated on me for and called me fagget and all types of names, which is funny because I‚Äôm always with the MOST BEAUTIFUL
AND SMARTEST WOMEN)

- I am tall, handsome, long curtly hair, and I have an enviable body (don‚Äôt believe me? Look up my page) 

- I have a healthy social life, go on dates ALL THE TIME (which is more than a majority of males in today‚Äôs pathetic age can say, even if they‚Äôll lie) 

- I struggle with severe PTSD, I have Asperger‚Äôs. Severe anxiety, and I‚Äôm very awkward even though people think I‚Äôm full of charm and charisma. 

- also I was rated with a high IQ, I speak 3 languages, and I‚Äôm non-binary/pansexual 



My whole life people have put me down, I‚Äôm not making this into a post about how everyone sucks and I‚Äôm doing better than you all, but it‚Äôs pathetic, insane, weak, and honestly, if I lived in more ancient times, AN EXECUTABLE WAY OF LIVING. 

I‚Äôm Puerto Rican and I‚Äôve faced racism my whole life even though I always did better than those who put me down, I used to get called the 40 y/o virgin until I became a sex symbol, slept with 4+ dozen people, and guess what? I‚Äôm still a gentlemen to women and do not degrade them. 

I‚Äôve come to realize that MOST (not all, but we do live in a world with 8 billion people. Even if 1-2 billion were good, that‚Äôs 6+ billion pathetic cunts who shouldn‚Äôt even exist and ruin the world for those of us who wish to see it better) Hate on those who are themselves, even if unconventional and ‚Äúweird‚Äù. It took me moving out the racist and backwards south the west coast and north east that I WAS NOT THIS HORRIBLE WEIRD PERSON. People literally see me as a hero up here, someone who isn‚Äôt afraid to be themselves and speak for what‚Äôs right. 

What I‚Äôve also learned in my 27 years of life, is that MOST PEOPLE ARE COWARDS WHO WILL NEVER AMOUNT TO SHIT AND THATS WHY THEY SHUT DOWN THOSE WHO TRULY SHINE. 


THIS NOT EVERYONE, there have truly been some divine incarnate human beings who have come to teach us a better way of life, I am one of those people. I have moments where I lash out and say truly horrible things about people, but that‚Äôs from a lifetime of people
Never truly seeing how great I am. I have always been an outcast, labeled a creep/weirdo, and a loser. 


Well, at 27M (no -binary, I just physically know I‚Äôm a man), I am fully confident in myself, I go on dates with beautiful women while
Wearing crop tops and looking like a girl myself because I HAVE THAT MUCH AURA AND PERSONALITY. this isn‚Äôt mean to be an angry post though, I truly hope that those of you who live truly miserable and hateful lives turn it around, nothing beats the freedom of being what you are. One day I wanna dress, act, and look like a woman?  I do it (and I do it QUITE WELL, I have a lot of androgynous features, especially on my face and petite build, even though I have the lean build of a man), when I wanna be the dominant man in the room
And make everyone subservient to me? I can and I will, I realized I‚Äôm not built like anyone before me. I am Jeriel Rodriguez Santana, I am non-binary (with feminine tendencies), I am fucking weird, I am a genius (literally been told my whole life and took a test, not some delusional bragging but FACTS), I get whatever sexy woman or man that I want, I travel the world, I FUCKING LIVE FREE 

I challenge you all to live insanely, free, and without limitations and to those of you who live in judegemwntal/religiously bigot misery, I pray you find love and God in your heart, at least find love for yourselves.  


I used to look at myself as a freak, yes I am a fucking junkie, yes I am queer/gender less, but I guarantee that I have positively changed more lives and impacted the world more than most of you internet haters who have nothing to offer the world aside from your disgusting outsize obesity (and nothing wrong with that, but when you combine obesity with a hateful/pathetic incel mindset, why are you even alive? Like go change yourself or do the world a favor and die, nobody will miss you. This last message was the pedos, neckbeard haters, judgemental fucks, and people who live for nothing outside of others misery.  

I will continue to grow, I will get sober, continue to be good to people, and to all those who said  I should kill myself, called me a fatty loser, told me nobody liked my whole life (literally even as an adult‚Ä¶ I know, it‚Äôs fucking atrocious), told I was gonna be loser incel, stay in my moms forever, etc. 

LOOOK AT ME NOW, I am well known all over the world, people look to me for how to be authentic/cool, now I‚Äôm a ROLE MODEL, especially for LGBTQ kids while I was a teacher, I go to the gym daily, and oh, I do drugs? Most of yall drink alcohol which is the worst drug, cigs, energy drinks, coffee, meds just ‚Äúbecause a doctor gave them to me‚Äù not even realizing you‚Äôre doing the same drugs I am. I live an enviable life, I go to raves every weekend, my health is great, and idc how cocky I sound, I AM A SEXY NON-BINARY (man/woman, I say that because I like to dress both and guess what? I look fucking beautiful as a woman and I have a nice butt from being toned out/petite). 

I‚Äôm not saying I live the best life, but if yall could truly have witnessed my life, yall would be blowing me up for books, movies, shows, etc. also, I‚Äôm a writer with over 100
Poems written, I‚Äôm writing a book, and yes, I wrote this on adderall. I will get clean and I will do it MY WAY, as I have always done üíÅüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

One last thing for the haters (not saying any are here, though I‚Äôm sure some will slide through the cracks lol): WHAT HAVE YOU COMPARED TO WHAT I HAVE DONE? This is both an insult and a challenge because I‚Äôm a believer that we CAN ALL CHANGE, many won‚Äôt though. 

Please be nice to me guys, I just needed to let this off my chest. This is years of mistreatment for my sexual orientation, gender identity, mental health/substance abuse issues, and for simply NOT BEING ASHAMED TO BE ME, we should all encourage each other to be our true selves, no matter how ‚Äúweird‚Äù or non-conforming it might be, maybe it‚Äôll make our society actually use its brain for once, then again, I‚Äôve lost hope in humanity especially America because we worship stupidity, homophobia, conformity so we can all be the same good white conservative Christian men & women that we should be, and we simply worship a life‚Ä¶ WITH NO LIFE, RATHER, NO ASPECTS OF WHAT MAKES LIFE LIFE.

But she stopped not because any of us begged us to. But because she almost died 3 times. Anyway, when she stopped I thought her hate and disdain for me in particular would fade seeing as she was there when I was born and has always been the Father role in my life since my mom left my dad and never told him about me. I couldn't of been more wrong... While the physical abuse slowed down she always seems to just be distant and rude tword me even being weirdly misogynistic? She'll let my nephews destroy the bathroom and yells at me to clean it up and tries to say it's my fault despite the fact it very clearly isn't. She'll do the same for any room though, she always finds a way to say it's my fault. I made a post about how my nephewa don't watch their dog and keep him out of the bathroom and so he's gotten I to the trash and into my pads, and somehow that's my fault? But recently the thing that really hurts is she got an old beaten up Jeep a few years ago and I begged and begged for years to have the Jeep and always got coldly shut down and scoffed at...and now she gave it to my nephew and I still don't have a car. That's when It really hit me she doesn't like me I mean I already kinda knew but this really drove it home. She also helped by my other nephew a car well actually 3 cars and has paid the insurance and all of that, but when I showed her a car and asked for help she immediately began laying onto me about asking for help and scoffed at me when I start crying. The worse thing though, is in 2023. Trigger warning self harm. My brother, is a bad druggy and he was going in his yusal Tangent beating his baby mama. I told him I was calling police and he began to absolutely lay into me verbally attacking me and telling me I'm better off dead and should kill myself and all of that, I called my stepmom sobbing and pleading with her to come and stop him, she was 2 minutes away at her moms having coffee, she told me to shut up and to just lock myself in my room as if that's ever stopped him before I kept begging her to please just take a moment and come get me or him and she screamed at me for being so needy and told me to leave her alone and hung up. I ended up spiraling so bad I attempted by slicing open my arm so bad I needed 17 stitches. It was horrible because I also sat there screaming for ahwhile minute blood going all down my legs before finally my step sister walked past the door and started to scream at me and put pressure on my arm.Shec called my step mom she was pissed al pissed it took her 5 minutes to even get home which sure is pretty fast  it remember shes only 2 minutes out. She screamed at me on the way to the hospital saying I was a useless idiot that I belong in a mental facility that she hopes they finally take me away, my arm was so bad the hospital said they can see my tendents and thought I needed surgery but I luckily didn't. She still was so horrible to me even in front of the doctors. When I bring this up to my mom she goes on a rant that she didn't have to step up and be there to support her and me but she did and that I should be greatful. Greatful? I don't even get clothes she bitches about me needing clothes I don't even want the expensive shit I ask if I can go to the thrift store and she blows up but the boys get full Nike outfits?

Dear Councilman Todd,

I‚Äôm writing to express serious concerns about Cedar Rapids' use of Automated License Plate Reader (ALPR) systems, and what this means for the future of our community‚Äôs privacy and freedom.

After nearly a decade working in the City of Cedar Rapids IT Department following the 2008 flood, I have a strong appreciation for the role technology plays in public service. But recently, something caught my attention that I couldn‚Äôt ignore.

A few months ago, I noticed a black camera mounted on a city pole. Being a bit of a tech nerd, I was curious. I started digging and discovered it was part of a Flock Safety ALPR system. What started as a simple question turned into a deep dive into surveillance technology, its vendors, and how it's being implemented here at home.

What I found was troubling:

- **Ethical Issues**: In January 2025, it was revealed that Flock Safety quietly employed a sitting California mayor, Ulises Cabrera, who later sued them for wrongful termination after refusing to leverage his public office for their benefit. (TechCrunch)
- **Privacy Violations**: Flock faces a federal lawsuit over claims that their expansive camera network constitutes unconstitutional, warrantless surveillance. (Forbes)
- **Lack of Oversight**: The company has refused independent third-party evaluations of its products, raising serious accountability concerns for such powerful technology. (ACLU)

In response, I co-founded Eyes Off CR ([www.eyesoffcr.org](http://www.eyesoffcr.org)) as part of the global deflock.me project to shine a light on how surveillance is being implemented in our community and beyond.

Before any official information was available, our team manually documented the locations of ALPR cameras throughout Cedar Rapids. Since then, we've worked with the Police Department to push for the creation of a transparency portal, which now includes an ALPR section. Frankly, it was a frustrating process... and I‚Äôm still waiting on a complete response to my FOIA request. This kind of information should have been made available from day one of the camera deployment.

We also know that Cedar Rapids has had a data-sharing agreement with federal agencies like the FBI and ICE since 2020. Given today‚Äôs national climate, this raises serious concerns about how locally collected data could be used (or misused) beyond our control. Despite our grassroots scale, Flock Safety contacted us over a minor correction in one of our blog posts. That such a large company is monitoring our local effort so closely raises further concerns about their reach and intentions. The email was a clear message meant to be a chilling effect, I believe. The EFF (Electronic Freedom Foundation) agreed, and instructed us to contact them if Flock does it again.

The contract‚Äôs value of $499,000 is another red flag. When I worked for the city, $499k was often used as a threshold to fast-track approvals. Anything over $500,000 required more scrutiny and time from the Council. The fact that this contract was set just under that limit raises legitimate questions. And here we are, eight weeks later, still trying to get the full picture as I‚Äôm still waiting for a quote from IT for the release of emails related to Flock. This raises doubts about their ability to manage the rotation of the 30-day video data.

To be clear, I personally believe some uses of ALPR technology are appropriate. Many disagree with me. The system at Marion Solid Waste, for instance, is a smart application focused on logistics and access control. Their planned expansion of ALPRs to Highway 100 and East Post Road does not fall into that category. ALPRs at City facilities for operational accountability make sense, but community-wide surveillance is something else entirely.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm urging you and the city to:

1. **Enhance Transparency**: Ensure that all information about surveillance technologies, including ALPR systems, is easily accessible through official public channels. Provide clear public notice and regular updates about any new surveillance systems being proposed or deployed.
2. **Engage the Community**: Hold open forums to discuss surveillance technology and give residents a real voice in decisions that affect their privacy and civil liberties.
3. **Review Effectiveness**: After the contract expires, publicly share data demonstrating a strong correlation between the installation of Flock Safety systems and the resolution of vehicle-related cases; if clear effectiveness is not evident, continued use should be seriously reconsidered.

---

## Councilman Todd, here‚Äôs my appeal to pathos:

I've been here 30 years. Went to Jefferson. I'm friends with the guys from Goldfinch. I get my coffee at Roasters and ride my bike on the trails. I'm just an ordinary Cedar Rapids resident who‚Äôs been paying attention and frankly, I‚Äôm afraid.

I‚Äôm afraid that the federal government is losing stability, and I fear that the surveillance systems we‚Äôre installing today could be turned against us tomorrow. I want to believe that these tools are meant to keep us safe, but history has shown us what happens when power goes unchecked and privacy is eroded.

Privacy isn‚Äôt a sign of wrongdoing; it‚Äôs a sign of freedom. It‚Äôs the ability to live without fear of being constantly watched or judged. When we normalize surveillance, we chip away at that freedom, piece by piece, until it‚Äôs gone.

I'm certainly not conspiratorial, but I fear we‚Äôre walking down a path that leads us to trade liberty for a false sense of security. And I fear that once we‚Äôve gone too far, we won‚Äôt be able to turn back.

Preface: I‚Äôm reading Capital now, I‚Äôm in chapter 13, so I‚Äôm not coming in completely cold.

A cup of coffee cost more than the cost of bean because there is more concentrated labor in it. The labor of the barista, the concentrated labor of the coffee machine, the concentrated labor of the roasted beans etc.

But is it ever less simple to say ‚Äúthe demand for coffee is higher than the demand for 100 unground coffee beans‚Äù ?

Diamonds take a lot of labor to get so diamonds have a high exchange value, but also the supply of diamonds is limited so they have a high exchange value.

1k6spz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/WYSIWYG_HTML_Editor/comments/1k6spz4/discover_the_best_html_code_generator_for_web/,Discover the Best HTML Code Generator for Web Development,"HTML code generators have helped web developers speed up their development cycles since their emergence. By providing a user-friendly interface to generate HTML code, they are able to significantly lessen manual coding. Many of these tools function as a [WYSIWYG editor](https://froala.com/), allowing users to create and edit web pages visually without needing to write extensive code.

Thus, businesses, developers, and even non-technical hobbyists have chosen to rely on these HTML generators or integrate them into their workflow.

If you‚Äôre planning to find the best HTML code generator that suits your needs, then read on below. In this guide, you‚Äôll see some key features to look for in these generators, as well as a list featuring the best of them. Additionally, you‚Äôll explore how you can quickly integrate one in your projects.

# **What is an HTML Code Generator?**

Whenever we build webpages, we write HTML code using text editors and view the result through a browser. Let‚Äôs call this ‚Äútraditional coding.‚Äù

HTML code generators, on the other hand, allow developers to use a visual or text-based interface to generate code.

For example, a user can type on the generator‚Äôs text editor, select the text, and click some buttons (e.g., bold and italics). Afterwards, the generator will convert the editor‚Äôs contents (e.g., &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some text&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) into HTML code. The way generators display the HTML code might differ, but the end result should be the same.

With these features, HTML generators help developers reduce or skip some basic coding, allowing them to focus on other important parts like optimization, security, and analysis.

# **Key Features to Look for in an HTML Code Generator**

Nowadays, code generators come with plenty of features. Most of these are standard and essential, while others have more niche or specific uses. Here are four important features that the best HTML code generators should contain:

# **User-friendly Interface**

This might appear obvious or simple at first glance, but the truth is that some generators prioritize other things over a polished user interface. Without proper layouts, organization, accessibility, customization, and a clean, modern look, a feature-rich code generator would turn into a difficult, counterintuitive tool.

So, for efficiency (and for not straining your eyes), choose a generator that looks and feels intuitive and seamless.

# **Auto-completion and Syntax Highlighting**

Auto-completion and syntax highlighting are integral parts of every development process because of how they reduce issues, ensure clean code, and provide convenience.

The former automatically suggests code when you type in the editor, possibly reducing human errors (such as typos). Additionally, it helps cut time when writing repetitive code. On the other hand, syntax highlighting helps you identify syntax errors or inconsistencies in the editor.

# **Code Snippets and Templates**

The code snippets feature contributes greatly to the rapid development of web pages. It allows developers to use pre-written codes and insert or paste them directly into projects.

Templates provide developers with a fixed yet customizable web page design and features. They serve as a good foundation for a project, especially for those who want a quick start.

# **Cross-browser Compatibility**

Browsers may display HTML code differently. That‚Äôs why you usually test the look and feel of your web pages across different browsers before deploying them.

The same goes for HTML generators. When looking for the right one for your use case, you should pick that which already has cross-browser compatibility.

# **Top HTML Code Generators Available Today**

There are many HTML generators available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Here‚Äôs a list of some of the best options you can consider:

# **1\. Froala Editor**

# **How to Choose the Right HTML Code Generator for Your Needs**

With many available options to generate HTML code, you should consider the following factors:

# **Project Requirements**

Are you building a full website, or are you looking to quickly generate HTML code? Do you need many features or just specific ones? Are compliance, security, clean layouts, SEO, and performance important for you? How about scalability?

# **Team Size**

If you‚Äôre working solo, you can opt for a simple, easy-to-use, and possibly free tool to generate HTML code. On the other hand, small and larger teams might benefit from more robust tools, especially those with collaboration features.

# **Budget**

Some HTML code generators are free or have a perpetual plan option. Others require a subscription. Better ones offer all of the aforementioned. Choose a tool that aligns with your budget constraints.

Remember that before you fully commit, you should test out the tools with either a free trial or a live demo. You can then gauge whether the features align with your needs and workflow.

# **Integrating an HTML Code Generator into Your Workflow**

You can use HTML code generators in several ways. Here are some examples that demonstrate how you can integrate them into your workflow:

# **Online HTML code generators**

If you just need a quick and accessible start to your projects, you can use online HTML generators. These include [online HTML editor](https://froala.com/online-html-editor/) demos and even AI-powered LLMs like [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/). To get started, visit the site of your preferred online editor.

# **Web app integration**

You can also integrate these generators into applications (e.g., internal apps or apps for your users). For example, you can install Froala Editor by either downloading its files as a ZIP, using the CDN, or using package managers like NPM.

After you have the editor‚Äôs files (or if you‚Äôre using CDN), you can then import them into your project directly like the following lines:

```plaintext
<!--Import via CDN--> 
<link href='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/froala-editor@latest/css/froala_editor.pkgd.min.css' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' /><script type='text/javascript' src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/froala-editor@latest/js/froala_editor.pkgd.min.js'></script>
```

Once you have them, you‚Äôre ready to initialize the editor and enable your application‚Äôs users to generate HTML.

# **As separate desktop applications**

Lastly, you can download or purchase full IDEs with code generation features. This method would probably require the most effort and resources but might also come with the most features. Hence, you must ensure that you can maximize the use of these features should you get such a code generator.

# **Conclusion**

In web development, you can supplement your current tech stack with a tool that can generate HTML code. This speeds up the layout design and development process while possibly reducing errors.

Before you start implementing, it is worth noting that neither traditional coding nor HTML generators is better than the other. Furthermore, you should always review generated code to be safe.

To find the best one for you, check each of the best HTML code generators out (demos, free trials, etc.). In the end, the answer will depend on your project needs, development style, pacing, and budget.

**[INTRO]**  
Hey Reddit, I need to vent about my unfinished love diary. This was supposed to be a sweet chronicle of my relationship with ""Pup"" ‚Äì my German ex-boyfriend and former Chinese language student. But life pulled a classic plot twist: he dumped me via *Textabschnitt* (that's ""paragraph"" in German, because of course he wrote a structured breakup essay) right when I reached Chapter 8. Now these fragments feel like Schr√∂dinger's love story ‚Äì both alive in my drafts and dead in reality.  

---  

### **Prologue: Love Was My Lottery Win**  
Let me introduce us through MBTI stereotypes because Gen Z said so:  
- **Him (INTJ/„ÄåPurple Grandpa„Äç):** German engineering in human form. Wears all black, schedules sexytime in Google Calendar, practices *Umweltschutz* by eating tofu off reusable titanium chopsticks. Thinks spontaneous people should be jailed. Secretly rocks pink Pok√©mon AirPods.  
- **Me (INFP/„ÄåElderly Butterfly„Äç):** Chaotic Chinese glitter tornado. Wears qipao dresses to grocery shopping, impulse-buys plane tickets during midnight breakdowns, communicates 70% through TikTok audios.  

We were the ""How tf did these two match on Tinder?"" couple.  

---  

### **Chapter 1: Disneyland & Emotional Baiting**  
*""When castle fireworks painted his eyelashes with stardust,  
The fox pretended clumsiness as his tail coiled around my wrist ‚Äì  
I livestreamed romance for strangers,  
Oblivious to falling into his constellation trap.""*  

Our meet-cute? I was his online Chinese tutor. At Shanghai Disney, this supposedly ""shy"" man pulled master-level Â•óË∑Ø (scheming):  
- Casually rested his head on my shoulder during fireworks  
- Let me FaceTime another dude while he slow-burned his move  
- Later confessed: *""That day redefined happiness for me""* (Plot twist: My oblivious ass thought he was just being *European*‚Ñ¢)  

---  

### **Chapter 2: Moonlight & Misaligned Motherboards**  
*""When Gauguin's moon drowned in his cobalt irises,  
Two wandering souls caught each other between book pages ‚Äì  
Native tongues melted into stardust,  
Proving silence could hum like resonating guitar strings.""*  

Our ""friendship"" phase:  
- Bonded over *The Moon and Sixpence* (he speed-read it to impress me)  
- I trauma-dumped about exes while he emotionally constipated through it  
- Him, an INTJ robot: ü§ñ *""Emotional processing...loading...""*  

---  

### **Chapter 3: Chengdu Crisis & 110 Romance**  
*""When moonlight shattered on the digital lock,  
His voice melted terror across 7,000km:  
'ÊàëÂú®' burned hotter than any love poem ‚Äì  
As his fingers hovered over 110,  
A secret spring began thawing frozen soil.""*  

Horror movie moment:  
- 1:30AM in Chengdu airbnb  
- Creep jiggling my door code  
- Me: *""Welp, time to text my German emotional support robot""*  
- Him: Simultaneously calming me AND dialing Chinese police (learned 110 ‚â† 911)  
- Later asked: *""Was this...flirting??""*  

---  

### **Chapter 4: Yunnan Hug & Nordic Overheating**  
*""His suitcase arced like shooting stars,  
Nordic body heat scorching Yunnan's breeze ‚Äì  
I counted clouds to hide trembling fingers,  
But our clasped hands bloomed bougainvillea-red.""*  

First IRL meetup after becoming official:  
- Airport hug so intense he yeeted his luggage  
- Me: *""Let's admire the view!""* (Translation: Panicking over blue-eyed Viking man)  
- Him: *""Why won't you talk? üò¢""* while death-gripping my sweaty palm  

---  

### **Chapter 5: HSK4 & Silly Foreigner Shenanigans**  
*""His pen became Excalibur,  
Translation apps built our Babel Tower ‚Äì  
Those crinkling handwriting books in overweight luggage?  
They're Zelda stardust he collected for me.""*  

Cultural exchange highlights:  
- Him proudly using Êï£Ë£Ö‰∏≠Êñá (broken Chinese) to buy ""silver ingots"" (actual paper offerings for ghosts)  
- Carrying 10kg of Â∞èÂ≠¶ÁîüÁªÉ‰π†ÂÜå (elementary school workbooks) despite ‚Ç¨1k luggage fee  
- Practicing strokes while making *""shooo!""* sword noises (I died)  

---  

### **Chapter 6: Google Translate Warfare**  
*""When Deutsch precision clashed with ‰∏≠Êñá ambiguity,  
'Love' became coffee vs aged wine ‚Äì  
Until we learned:  
Embracing speaks clearer than grammar.""*  

Our fights were Duolingo horror stories:  
- Me: *""‰∏çË¶Å‰∏çË¶Å~""* (Playful ""no no~"")  
- Google: *""DO NOT DO NOT""* ‚Üí Him: üò±  
- His solution? Uploading our chats to ChatGPT for emotional decoding ü§Ø  

---  

### **Chapter 7: Kant vs Neruda**  
*""His suit pockets held Kant and black coffee,  
My skirt hosted Neruda's blue butterflies ‚Äì  
When quantum physics met postmodern poetry,  
Even equations bloomed iris patterns.""*  

Our ""nerd love"" moments:  
- Him: Stock charts, Umweltverschmutzung lectures, 5-year plans  
- Me: Writing cringey poems about his golden hair swirl  
- Mutual agreement: *""You make my world impressionistic""*  

---  

### **Chapter 8: The Unfinished Code**  
*""Bug meets bug in digital twilight,  
Six time zones weaving spider-silk coordinates ‚Äì  
No chessboard needed when two stars collide,  
Each sunrise whispers: 'Welcome home'.""*

My friend though‚Äîhe‚Äôs an extrovert. He keeps the conversations going, even if it‚Äôs just ranting, gossip, or complaining about work or the manager. Somehow, he builds bonds on just that. So, slowly, all those people I used to be close with? They‚Äôre closer to him now.

And here‚Äôs another thing: he lives super close to the office. Walking distance. So he goes almost daily. Me? I live 10 kilometers away and just follow the official policy‚Äîone week per month in office. That means he sees people from other teams, chats with them casually over coffee or lunch. It‚Äôs literally a numbers game. If you‚Äôre around the same people every day, sooner or later, you‚Äôll strike up a conversation. Especially when they‚Äôre at your level, joined the same time, share the same frustrations.

Even when I do go to the office, I struggle to talk to the same people I used to have great conversations with. It‚Äôs like I forgot how to maintain those connections. And he‚Äôs just out there doing it like it‚Äôs second nature.

Here‚Äôs something wild though‚Äîat one point, I actually dated someone from our team. She was just a year or two senior to me, absolutely gorgeous. And I pulled that off with my charm.

And I want to make this clear‚ÄîI‚Äôm not actually jealous of him. Because I know all this stuff‚Äîthese friendships, these conversations‚Äîthey‚Äôre all surface level.

Moved cities, sold my Gaggia Classic Pro and Sette 30 grinder, has been on take out coffee for 3+ months (going crazy).   
I found an official refurbish place for Breville products and they have Sette 270 for \~$230 (like new) and Vario W+ for \~$290-310 (good/ excellent conditions).   
I've search through the sub, I've watched countless youtube reviews. I'm pretty sure I will be happy with Sette 270 BUT it's sooooooo loud.  I now live in a smaller place no, where our bedroom is on a second floor's loft, so morning coffee will mean my SO has to get up. This is my main concern (no issues with gearbox on sette 30 for 3 years).   
I know people suggest DF64/ Niche Zero/ Eureka Mignon Specialista instead WHEN the price range is the same. But I'm talking about $200-300 range and I don't think there are good alternatives to these two.   
Is it worth going to Vario W+ for almost $100 more?   
To give context: I'm getting a bambino to start with. Me and my SO only drink milk drinks. 2x lattes a day each. GCP was great but inconsistent and it got tiring temp surfing etc. I would ideally get Bambino+ for now so my SO could froth milk for themselves too, but it's not currently available.   
Eventually I'll plan to switch to Lelit Anna w PID.

1k6smu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1k6smu6/was_i_able_to_avoid_refeeding_syndrome/,Was I Able To Avoid Refeeding Syndrome?,"  Hello, I'm not too sure how to start this post besides I'm 25 years old, female, and 5'1 in height. I also apologize if my post isn't organized or detailed enough as I'm trying to remember everything I feel like I need to address. 

So I've had problems for a long time now but it's only been until around last year's winter where I've been having serious problems with food. I don't want to say I'm anorexic or bulimic or anything like that because I have yet to really see anyone to give me a full diagnosis.

Since November of last year I've been trying not to eat, binging, abusing laxative tea, chewing and spitting, etc. I've been doubling and tripling the Niacin supplements until the bottle ran out around that time but I can't remember the specific quantities of it; I haven't gotten anymore since I ran out in December. By January, I weighed 74 lbs but then I just stopped caring and started binging without trying to correct it. I wasn't trying to actively gain weight healthily it was more like an ""I'll just eat what I want and not care"" approach and I managed to get to 85 lbs by the middle of February. I honestly felt totally fine at that time but in that time, a new stressful event occurred and I basically started going back to my old habits. By the end of February, I resumed restricting, calorie counting, binging, and abusing laxative tea.

This time I think it's gotten a lot more difficult to deal with. The binges were more extreme, the calorie counting was more extreme, I weigh myself every 30 minutes, using regular laxative medication instead of laxative tea, limited the amount of fluid I was drinking to avoid ""water weight"", etc. It's hard to go into details about the symptoms I feel because I try to ignore the way I physically feel a lot until I'm just used to it. I remember having the usual headaches, stomach aches from hunger or over eating, feeling exhausted at times, feeling foggy, etc.,. A weird thing I noticed was how my right ear tend to get fuzzy hearing when I'm around loud noises and it takes a while for it to become normal again. I used Prunelax twice within the recommended amount and when the second time I used Prunelax didn't work after the 12 hour mark, I drank a whole 10 fl oz bottle of Magnesium Citrate with a glass of water. The day before I took the Magnesium Citrate was the last day I ate food for the next 8 days, and the day I took the Magnesium Citrate was the last day I had any water for the next 7 days.

The days I had no food or water I only had my morning coffee with milk and sugar and two of those days I had a matcha latte in the afternoon as my only fluids. Some days I had major hunger pains and lethargy but managed to pull myself together to get through work shifts and do chores, other days I honestly felt totally normal physically as if I'm not starving and dehydrated. That Thursday, I had this idea that I should just binge again because I felt like I lost enough weight I can ""afford"" to binge. I was aware of Refeeding Syndrome but I only went as far as to look up what the ""danger zone"" would be and I thought I met about three things in the criteria, (My BMI was 12.7, I haven't eaten in 5+ days, I lost more than 10% of weight in the last 2-3 months) I didn't take any precautions with refeeding, I just took that ""I don't care this is future me's problem"" approach that I had earlier this year.

This time, because I knew I was going to regret it and try to lose the weight again I managed to keep notes of everything I consumed until Sunday. minus calorie count. I'll admit, after Sunday I am currently back in my old habits of avoiding eating, binging, and trying to abuse laxatives again. In the whole week that I was ""willfully""(binging without intending to correct it) binging, my stomach was hurting like crazy from how much food it was holding, my back was hurting because I feel like my stomach was pulling the skin on my back taut, I had fluid retention in my legs within the middle of the week onwards and it was extremely uncomfortable. I was able to go to the bathroom normally. I had occasional chills at random points in time. I had headaches at times. As of now, I feel OK on a physical level, or at least I feel like how I did before I had that week long starvation period. How I've been feeling on a mental level is a completely different story that I can't even begin to start.

Below is the screenshot of everything I consumed during the week of binge eating without any intention to purge or restrict afterwards.

For context, I use the term ""Cat Plate"" or ""Cat Bowl"" because I have these plates that I'm attached to and I eat the majority of my food with. The plate is 7.75 inches in diameter and 1.75 inches deep and the bowl is 5.25 inches in diameter and 2.5 inches deep to give you an idea of the portions. It's hard to see but I included my starting weight before binge eating at 66.4 lbs, and my ending weight when I stopped taking notes of what I was consuming at 83.4 lbs. Even though I stopped saving notes, I can try to remember what I've been consuming after the second Sunday if I need to mention that.

[I originally wrote this article for my Linkedin page but was requested to also put in on a different platform. So I guess this is a good place :)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/eindelijk-los-van-amerikaanse-tech-johan-antonissen-fb1te/)

**Introduction**  
When I saw two months ago how the American tech leaders stood like little puppets next to each other at Trump's inauguration, I knew it was time to definitively say goodbye to American tech. For a long time, I haven't been a fan of hyper-capitalist America, but now there was also fascist and imperialist America... In the past, I had tried to switch to open source, but unfortunately, the alternatives weren't good enough yet. Fortunately, that's a different story these days...

**Low-hanging fruit...**  
The first steps are easy:

* Google Chrome -> Brave
* Youtube -> Nebula
* Youtube music -> Spotify, Bandcamp, Jellyfin
* Netflix -> NPO (Dutch public broadcasting), Radarr, Sonarr, Jellyseerr
* Whatsapp -> NOTHING...

Unfortunately, there's still no good alternative for WhatsApp. Besides the incredible technology lock-in with WhatsApp, Signal is a stupid alternative.

Why?

Signal is an American company, and its main sponsor is Elon Musk... Musk is a Fascist. Hopefully, the EIC - European Innovation Council will support the app Threema.

**Goodbye Android...**  
Every day, an Android phone collects 30 MB of telemetry data from you, compared to 15 MB for Apple. That needs to go to 0 MB.

I was lucky; I had been annoyed for a long time by the fact that I almost always had to buy a new phone if even the slightest thing was broken. And why should I need a new phone every 2 years?

In my opinion, all phones are exactly the same these days.

Nice screen, good camera, rectangular, flat.

Yet, there is one company that does make innovative phones: the Dutch company [Fairphone](https://www.fairphone.com/nl) makes completely sustainable phones with easily replaceable components!

Fantastic!

https://preview.redd.it/sz73w5sk1swe1.jpg?width=1067&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d81c143d67d2f1e2a1915c556926ecea64fb83ee

Besides that, Fairphone has apparently discovered something beautiful. Besides their users being wealthy white Yuppies, a part of them are apparently also nerdy hackers. I think I'm a wealthy white nerdy hacker Yup myself, so the Fairphone is really something for me. And the best part? For this reason, Fairphone also supports various alternative operating systems besides Android, such as eOS from the French tech startup [MURENA.](https://murena.com/)

https://preview.redd.it/prin1t0y1swe1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=58c24f0eb13f71391e04e63ee6dfb4e71af6936c

*n Software Center where you can easily install all the applications you want with one click!*

* Obsidian (best note and project planning app ever)
* VSCode (yeah yeah Microsoft, I know. But Bill Gates is the only American Tech good guy)
* Anaconda (Python)
* Gummi (Latex)
* Photoshop -> GIMP
* AutoCAD -> LibreCAD (for 2D)
* Inventor -> FreeCAD (for 3D)
* Ansys -> GFortran, *10X Engineers already work with APDL anyway, so Fortran is a small step ;-)*
* Handbrake
* Blender
* Steam (yeah, this runs on Linux! In fact, the Steam console runs on Arch Linux!)

**Google Home**

And then there's Google Home... My house is full of Google. Shit.

* 2 Google Home Max
* 2 Google Home
* 3 Google Home Mini
* 6 tado¬∞ Radiator Knobs (European (German!))
* 10 Smart Energy monitors from HomeWizard (European (Dutch!!))
* \~20 Philips Hue lamps

Fortunately, there's a great alternative these days that works just as well!

*Home Assistant!*

https://preview.redd.it/lbh383xy2swe1.png?width=1539&format=png&auto=webp&s=db4ea59736946ec05c4a1ff2e878efa8f178f02e

With this, all devices that normally communicate via Google Home can now be controlled locally, without the internet.

Normally, Home Assistant has to be controlled via Docker or with a Raspberry Pi (also European!). But Home Assistant now also has complete boxes that you can buy where everything is already pre-configured:

* [Home Assistant Green (the brain) ](https://www.home-assistant.io/green/)
* [Home Assistant Voice (the voice) ](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice-pe/)

And it's set up quickly! In two evenings, I had already added all my devices and could control the lights and play music in the living room with my voice.

https://preview.redd.it/3ay9w1753swe1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=da18bfdecf8743ae10454323fbdf0302b0734eee

And with a bit of tinkering with influxDB and Grafana on my server (more on that later), I could also draw beautiful interactive graphs of my home energy consumption:

https://preview.redd.it/iarsg4q73swe1.png?width=2028&format=png&auto=webp&s=99420d1afd9e0a1e92a8b5152bd891bf9cf49d1d

  
**Time for a homelab server.**

There's now only one application left:

* Google Photos

There's a FANTASTIC alternative for this. But to run it, you do need your own server.

Fortunately, I have that!

Not a very powerful one, but a very energy-efficient one! 30 Watts, only half a light bulb!

https://preview.redd.it/3d2decce3swe1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f5e87ed4932bf4c86540c44da06f417e31903bbd

If you open the cabinet to the right of my desk, you'll find my server. From top to bottom, these are:

* Home Assistant Green
* 2x 6TB SeaGate HDD
* [intel NUC i5 (2018) with 16 GB RAM](https://nucblog.net/2018/11/coffee-lake-i5-nuc-review-nuc8i5bek-nuc8i5beh/) (cost 300 euros at the time).
* [QNAP TR-04 DAS](https://www.qnap.com/en-us/product/tr-004) with RAID1 2x 4TB Seagate IronWolf HDD

A modest (yes, believe me, this is modest) server rack. I understand that this is too advanced for many, but Synology NAS products, for example, are a very nice ready-made alternative for the non-nerd! So you can do this too! Really!

My server runs Linux Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. Ubuntu is often chosen for its stability and is often the entry-level choice for people who want to start with Linux. This server currently runs 25 Docker containers. [A Docker container is a completely stripped-down virtual Linux computer that runs one application. Docker is truly fantastic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGz9DS-aIeY)

Currently, I run 25 Docker applications (containers) on my server to break free from American Tech. However, I think only 10% of these are indispensable.

https://preview.redd.it/m5w2uiq54swe1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=f68d7885709cdbf66bd9ad81d010a1bf8c2fb06b

The most important container is the one that replaces my Google Photos:

* Google Photos -> Immich

Immich is fantastic. It has an Android and iOS app. It has facial recognition with AI, and it's lightning fast! I never want to go back!

https://preview.redd.it/9edo9hl94swe1.png?width=1551&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a59a449258c00c77a12e4509721a0957853dbbd

**Joy**

Well, that was quite a ride to write. Why am I writing it down? Because I'm proud of it. And because I would like to show people that it is really possible to step away from American Tech. Nowadays, there is so much open source available, it's really easy to set up, looks good, and is quite user-friendly.

Although the last step with your own server is indeed quite difficult, switching to Fairphone with MURENA is really very easy to do. And Home Assistant is also incredibly easy these days!

And as for switching to Linux and Immich...

For Linux, I would say, take one of your old laptops out of the closet that's no longer running smoothly and install Fedora Linux on it. Just try it! In the worst case, you'll lose 30 minutes of your life with the installation. In the best case, you'll have brought your slow scrap laptop back to life!

And for Immich? This project is currently still in public beta. But I wouldn't be surprised if Immich simply becomes a standard part of Home Assistant in the near future...

*Bye! I'm going to enjoy the fact that I have my own privacy back in my hands and am no longer complicit in the destruction of the world by American Tech.*",0,1745502405.0,degoogle,3,0.38,False
1k6sm8w,https://i.redd.it/cn5hr4wqeswe1.jpeg,"[THEORY] Usopp Will Defeat Imu by Lying Them Out of Existence ‚Äì He‚Äôs Not Just a God, He‚Äôs a Narrative Weapon","Okay, listen. I know this sounds insane. But I‚Äôve been rereading Dressrosa, Egghead, and everything in between while sleep-deprived and living off black coffee and existential dread, and I‚Äôm convinced:
Usopp will be the one to take down Imu.

Not Luffy.
Not Blackbeard.
Not Shanks.
USOPP.

Why? Because Usopp‚Äôs greatest power isn‚Äôt sniping. It‚Äôs lying. But not just any lying‚Äîreality-warping, god-tier lying that reshapes the world.



‚ÄúThe truth is‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt even exist. You‚Äôre just a scary story told to children. You were never real.‚Äù
‚Äî Usopp‚Äôs final line to Imu



1. The Pattern of Prophetic Lying
	‚Ä¢	Giant Goldfish ‚Üí He lies, ‚ÄúI fought a giant goldfish.‚Äù
‚Üí Punk Hazard shows exactly that.
	‚Ä¢	8,000 Followers ‚Üí He brags, ‚ÄúI have 8,000 followers.‚Äù
‚Üí Dressrosa‚Äôs Monday Knights make it real.
	‚Ä¢	Warrior of the Sea ‚Üí He claims ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a brave warrior.‚Äù
‚Üí Earns ‚ÄúGod Usopp‚Äù status in Dressrosa.
	‚Ä¢	Dragon Slayer ‚Üí ‚ÄúI fought a dragon!‚Äù
‚Üí Shows up again on Punk Hazard.

At this point, we‚Äôre past coincidence. Reality bends to fulfill his ‚Äúlies.‚Äù



2. Imu = Absolute Control

Imu erases names, rewrites history, and deletes people like a backspace key.
	‚Ä¢	Imu‚Äôs power = Deletion
	‚Ä¢	Usopp‚Äôs power = Creation

They‚Äôre opposites. Order vs. Chaos. Erase vs. Insert.



3. The Final Showdown
	1.	Straw Hats down: Luffy‚Äôs KO‚Äôd, Zoro‚Äôs out, Nami‚Äôs panicking.
	2.	Usopp stands alone, battered but breathing.
	3.	Imu sneers:
‚ÄúYou are nothing. A joke. A bug I can erase.‚Äù
	4.	Usopp smirks, trembling:
‚ÄúYou were never real.‚Äù
	5.	Imu vanishes‚Äîbecause Usopp‚Äôs lies always come true.



4. Why It Fits Oda‚Äôs ‚ÄúShock‚Äù Ending
	‚Ä¢	The weakest Straw Hat upends the ultimate villain.
	‚Ä¢	Not through strength or willpower, but through narrative power.
	‚Ä¢	Luffy is Joy Boy, but Usopp is the Plot Device.


Usopp‚Äôs ‚Äúlies‚Äù are reality-warping. Imu‚Äôs ‚Äúpower‚Äù is erasure. In the climax, Usopp simply lies Imu out of existence‚Äîthe ultimate meta-twist.",0,1745502381.0,OnePiece,5,0.4,False

I've seen a lot of people post on here about voids that the Chattanooga area businesses haven't created yet. I think I've come up with one and want to share it with everyone here.

I'm creating a mobile dart wars company, called Scenic City Dart Wars. As a dad, I've seen how hard it is to book birthday parties for my son. Event venues are increasing expensive and to be honest, there isn't a lot of entertainment options other than like the Zoo, Aquarium, or one of the multiple play spaces. 

I'm creating a company that fixes both of those problems. I will come to you. All you need is your backyard, a park, or any other space. I'll bring everything. Nerf blasters, ammo, eye protection, inflatable obstacles, and music. 

I'm also an Educator. I can see how this would be great in schools too. Whether for students or for even staff engagement as something fun to do. Corporate businesses can hire us for staff team building activities too.

This idea might be a flop. Or, it might be wildly successful. However, I think it fills a need. Just like the guy that posted about his coffee and lifestyle brand the other day, all it takes is doing it and seeing if it works.

Our son is now 5 weeks old and is bottle fed as breastfeeding simply wasn‚Äôt working for either my wife or him while we were in the hospital. We decided early on that I would get up with the baby overnight as my wife would need to get up to pump which seemed fine & dandy at the time. Fast forward 5 weeks and I feel completely drained and frustrated at our arraignment. 

My wife sets an alarm for roughly 2 am & 6 am to pump for 25 minutes either in bed with her portable pump or in the nursery by herself. She‚Äôs usually listening to a podcast and playing games on her phone while she pumps. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm responsible for the baby every time he wakes and cries so those can be anywhere from 20 minutes to 2 hours before I can get him back in his bassinet sleeping soundly. A typical wake/change/feed is going to take about an hour. My main frustration here is just that I have no idea when I‚Äôll be up or for how long while my wife has a pretty set schedule of being awake to pump for about a half an hour in a peaceful environment then she‚Äôs back to bed. 

Flash forward to the early morning and I‚Äôm usually up with the baby for the day by 6 am and my wife sleeps in until roughly 9 am so another 3ish hours with just me and the baby. Once my wife is up, she pumps and then makes herself breakfast/coffee so another hour or so where I‚Äôm basically on my own with him. She also insists on taking roughly 2 hour naps in the early afternoon which again, I‚Äôm on my own with the baby. 

Outside of all that we basically split time through the rest of the day with him 50/50 unless she‚Äôs pumping which I‚Äôm then solely responsible for him. I also am the main one taking care of our 2 dogs & cleaning up around the house doing laundry and whatnot. I hate feeling like I need to complain about taking care of my son as being a dad is the best thing that‚Äôs happened to me but I just feel so drained‚Ä¶. ",2,1745501726.0,newborns,0,1.0,False

### Understanding the Shift to Functional Beverages

Making the switch to functional beverages can seem daunting if you‚Äôre used to traditional sugary or caffeine-laden drinks. Functional beverages, enriched with vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and other health-boosting ingredients, offer more than just hydration‚Äîthey provide wellness benefits that support your body and mind. The key to a smooth transition lies in understanding how these drinks can fit into your daily routine and lifestyle.

### Identify Your Wellness Goals Clearly

Before choosing which functional beverages to incorporate, pinpoint your specific wellness goals. Are you aiming to boost immunity, improve digestion, increase energy naturally, or manage stress? Different functional beverages target different health areas. For example, probiotic drinks support gut health, while herbal teas with adaptogens can help reduce anxiety. Being clear about what you want will help you select products that truly benefit you, making your transition effective and purposeful.

### Start Small and Gradually Incorporate Functional Drinks

You don‚Äôt need to overhaul your entire beverage intake overnight. Starting small allows your palate and system to adjust comfortably. Begin by replacing one daily drink‚Äîlike soda or coffee‚Äîwith a functional alternative. For instance, swap your afternoon soft drink with a natural kombucha or a vitamin-infused water. This gradual approach minimizes shock to your routine and increases the chances of long-term adoption.

- Replace sugary sodas with flavored sparkling water enriched with antioxidants.
- Switch out your late-night dessert beverages for chamomile tea to support relaxation.
- Integrate green tea or matcha for a gentle caffeine lift paired with antioxidants.

### Read Labels and Understand Ingredients

Not all functional beverages are created equal. Reading labels carefully helps you avoid hidden sugars, artificial additives, and fillers that can undermine your health goals. Pay attention to the key active ingredients and their proven benefits. For example, if you want to improve gut health, choosing a drink high in live probiotics is essential. If energy is your goal, natural caffeine sources like green tea extract or guarana are better choices than synthetic stimulants.

Choosing organic and non-GMO options when possible adds an extra layer of wellness assurance. Avoiding artificial colors and preservatives ensures your body absorbs only what‚Äôs beneficial.

### Experiment with Different Flavors and Formats

Functional beverages come in various types‚Äîfrom ready-to-drink bottles and powders to concentrates and shots. Experimenting with different formats helps you find what fits your taste preferences and lifestyle. For example, if you‚Äôre always on the go, single-serving shots packed with vitamins or electrolytes might be convenient. If you enjoy savoring your drinks, brewed kombuchas or infused herbal teas could be more satisfying.

Trying various flavors also keeps your experience fresh and enjoyable. Many brands offer berry, citrus, or tropical flavors that make drinking functional beverages feel indulgent rather than a chore.

### Pair Functional Beverages with a Balanced Diet

Remember, functional beverages are meant to enhance, not replace, a healthy diet. To maximize their benefits, pair them with balanced meals rich in whole foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. This synergy supports your body's nutrient needs comprehensively.

‚Äã -Get 20% Off Adaptogen Mushroom Superblends Here:https://hownow101.github.io/Adaptogens - ‚Äã  
  
Staying hydrated is crucial, so use functional beverages as part of your hydration strategy rather than the entire source of fluids. Drinking plenty of water throughout the day ensures your body processes the added nutrients effectively.

### Stay Consistent and Track Your Progress

Consistency is key when it comes to experiencing the full effects of functional beverages. Incorporate them into your daily routine and give your body time to respond. Keep a simple journal noting which drinks you try, how you feel after consuming them, and any changes in energy levels, digestion, or mood.

This feedback loop guides you to choose beverages that work best and adjust your intake as needed. Over time, this mindful approach fosters a successful transition that becomes a natural part of your healthy lifestyle.

### Finding Community and Support

Connecting with others who have transitioned to functional beverages can boost motivation. Join online groups, follow wellness influencers, or visit local health stores to learn about new products and get tips. Sharing experiences helps you stay informed about trends, benefits, and potential pitfalls, making the journey smoother and more enjoyable.

‚Äã -Get 20% Off Adaptogen Mushroom Superblends Here:https://hownow101.github.io/Adaptogens - ‚Äã  
  
Transitioning to functional beverages involves more than swapping one drink for another. With clear goals, mindful choices, and steady habits, you can harness the power of these wellness-focused drinks to support your health in meaningful ways.

Understanding the Health Benefits and Market Trends of Functional Beverages
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Unlocking the Wellness Potential in Every Sip

Functional beverages are more than just drinks‚Äîthey offer targeted benefits that support your body's health in multiple ways. These beverages are carefully crafted with ingredients like vitamins, minerals, probiotics, antioxidants, and adaptogens to promote physical and mental well-being. Unlike traditional soft drinks or plain water, functional beverages actively contribute to improving mood, digestion, immunity, hydration, and energy levels. If you've been wondering why they‚Äôre gaining popularity, it‚Äôs because people want more than refreshment‚Äîthey want drinks that work for their health too.

Health experts often recommend functional beverages because they can help fill nutritional gaps in your daily routine. For example, a probiotic drink can improve gut health, which impacts everything from digestion to mood. Antioxidant-rich options can fight free radicals, slowing down the signs of aging and reducing inflammation. Influenced by growing wellness awareness, many consumers are shifting away from sugary sodas and high-calorie juices to these healthier, enhanced alternatives.

I am trying to write the best I can, for my keyboard feels like liquid while my melting fingers type into it.

I‚Äôve been working security at a dying mall for three years. It‚Äôs a place stuck in time‚Äîflickering lights, creaky floors, and empty corridors. But last night? Last night, though, the mall showed me something I can‚Äôt unsee. Now I‚Äôm scared to close my eyes, let alone go back, for should my head start spinning again, I might go mad.

It was 2 a.m., the hour when the world feels like it‚Äôs holding its breath. The security office was a coffin of buzzing fluorescents and cracked plastic chairs, the monitors casting a sickly glow across my thermos of cold coffee. I was half-asleep, lulled by the static hum from my radio, when Camera 7‚Äîthe food court feed‚Äîflickered. There I was, walking past the shuttered pretzel kiosk. My navy uniform hung loose on my frame, my slouch unmistakable. But I was here, in the office, not there. The timestamp pulsed: 2:03 a.m., now, alive.

My stomach churned, a violent swirl like gears grinding an old maschine . I grabbed my radio, my voice trembling. ‚ÄúAnyone in the building? Identify yourself!‚Äù Only static answered, threaded with a faint whine, like wind through a cracked window. The log showed no one signed in. I was alone. But the mall seemed to disagree.

On the screen, the figure that wore my face froze. He turned, slow as a marionette, and stared into the camera. His eyes were too large, pupils blooming like ink spilled in milk, and his mouth stretched into a smile that wasn‚Äôt mine. The smile stretched too far‚Äîunnaturally wide, like invisible hands were pulling his face from both sides.

The air in the office thickened, tasting of copper and ozone. He raised a hand, fingers elongating, curling like tendrils, and pointed, not at the camera, but through it‚Äîinto me. The monitor hissed, and his face pressed against the lens, skin rippling like a pond disturbed by a stone. Then the feed dissolved - into a kaleidoscope of static, colors bleeding into shapes that made my temples throb.

I knocked over my coffee, the liquid pooling on the floor in patterns that looked like spiraling galaxies. My breath caught in shallow gasps, each one jagged, as if the air itself had grown thicker as I cycled through the other cameras.

Camera 12 - east entrance: another me, standing before the glass doors, head tilted so far it touched his shoulder, his shadow stretching across the floor, writhing like a nest of eels.

Camera 4 - the atrium: me, perched on a bench, rocking back and forth, my hands melted into my knees, fingers sinking into the flesh as though I were made of wax, softening under pressure.

Camera 9- ¬†service corridor: me, pacing in a spiral, my footsteps leaving smears of light that pulsed and faded.

Each feed showed a new me, each more wrong.

One crawled across the electronics store‚Äôs floor, limbs bending backward, joints popping like wet wood.

Another stood in the fountain, water cascading upward, defying gravity, his reflection a fractured mosaic of eyes and mouths.

The timestamps flickered, numbers dissolving into glyphs‚Äîsquirming like worms, writhing as though alive. The monitors hummed a low, discordant song, and the walls of the office seemed to pulse, veins of light threading through the plaster.

I tried my phone -dead. The radio spat static, now laced with voices, overlapping, all mine, whispering words I couldn‚Äôt grasp. The air grew heavy, pressing against my skin like damp velvet. Then the office door groaned, bending inward as if underwater. I spun around, flashlight beam slicing the dark, but the doorway was a void, swallowing light.

The monitors flickered in unison, and every feed showed¬†*me*, standing in the office, staring at the screens. Behind each me loomed a shadow, taller than the room allowed, its edges fraying into tendrils that coiled around the walls, the ceiling, the air itself. The shadows didn‚Äôt move, but their presence burned in my mind, a weight that made my thoughts slippery.

The shadows stretched towards me, and I realized, with a sickening lurch, that they had already started to crawl inside my mind.",3,1745501452.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

She's learned how to pull open the cabinet, too?! But I reeeallyyyy need to keep her off the counter. Any ideas??! It's like having a toddler around! 

Also: 
She is healthy (no diabetes for example) 
I have a gravity feeder so they can eat/drink anytime. 
She is always eating, there is literally nothing she won't (ie pulled a chunk of a burger I was eating out of the bun and ran off with it)
She is about 10 years old 


Sprays? Plug ins? I've tried aluminum foil, she just walks around and on it. I've been putting towels over the stovetop for now but can't keep doing that, especially if people come over, that just looks bad and not sanitary.

I thought it was just installing a text editor. ""Try Emacs,"" internet folks said, ""it's not just an editor, it's a lifestyle."" My wife even encouraged me: ""Didn't you always want to improve your programming efficiency?"" That was the last time she smiled at me.

I didn't choose simple VSCode or Sublime. No, I chose Emacs, as if deliberately trying to ruin my marriage. The first day, I spent 8 hours configuring my init.el file. My wife brought dinner, and without looking up, I said: ""After I finish this key binding, C-x M-c M-butterfly...""

She asked if we could visit her parents over the weekend. I replied: ""As soon as I figure out org-mode's scheduling system."" That was two weeks ago. She went to her parents' house, while I researched how to control my coffee machine with Emacs, because apparently one editor should be responsible for every aspect of my life.

My wife tried to save our relationship. ""Let's go see a movie,"" she suggested. I answered: ""Wait, I'm writing a movie reminder plugin in elisp."" She asked: ""Do you remember the last time we held hands?"" I countered: ""OK, let me check my org journal.""

Then came that fateful night. I finally achieved my ultimate goal: running an entire operating system inside Emacs. When my wife walked into the study and saw me giggling at a screen full of parentheses, something changed in her eyes. ""I married a human, not a pile of brackets.""

She left with just a note: ""I'm going to find someone who uses Notepad. At least they know when to turn off the computer.""

And I just wondered: can this divorce notice be processed with the M-x wife-mode-disable command?",71,1745501012.0,emacs,11,0.89,False

I got several suggestions to watch TGWDLM next and of course Cinderella's Castle just came out, so I had to watch that as well.

# Cinderella's Castle

A really good musical. I saw a lot of mixed reception on this sub, so I went in with low expectations. Maybe that helped because CC blew my those low expectations out of the water! I really liked Cursed Crazy. There was some top notch choreography going on there.  ""I Look Good In This"" was really good too. As someone who really likes villain songs, this one was top tier. I've bought their soundtrack on Shopify and I'll listen to it a bit more to see if any more earworms develop.

The secondary characters were all awesome. Sir Hops-A-Lot and Crumb were charming and cute, and deserved a song. I thought the Prince was a funny comic relief character, and was a great way to take the Prince. Oh, and Rancilda's dream of living under a bridge and throwing out riddles was a great gag.

The set was beautiful. Top notch production values, just ::chef's kiss:: good.

But while I liked almost all the secondary characters, Cinderella herself is my only real problem. Her treatment of Thadeus really made me dislike her for a bit there. If she'd maybe reeled that in or apologized to him when she realized he wasn't like the Prince, it could have worked better. But man, that was just mean. It also felt kind of out of character, so I just sort of pushed it out of my head.

I also wouldn't have minded if she'd have planned that the slipper magic would bring her back to life. Like, maybe somehow she arranged that final scene where she returns victorious. As it was, it felt very deus-ex-machina. But honestly, not a huge complaint. Bryce Charles's singing was so good, it's easy to overlook those flaws.

# The Guy Who Didn't Like Musicals

I knew going in it's a fan-favorite so I was ready to really enjoy this one.

It started out strong. La Dee Da Da Day is a straight up banger, one of the best songs in any StarKid musical. The coffee shop song was awesome too, and watching Lauren Lopez's face as she did the dance number was hilarious. But, I kind of rolled my eyes at Professor Hidgens. He's both a biology professor and a disaster prepper. That seemed just a little *too* convenient. They lampshaded it a bit with the whole ""You predicted *this* would happen?"" question, but then... neither of those traits really mattered? Anyone could have guessed the alien's gimmick so he didn't need to be a professor. And he immediately betrayed his other big personality trait letting the monsters in. It really didn't make any sense to me (although Working Boys is the third best song).

And, OK, I know this is my hangup, and they couldn't have predicted the way the world would be in 2025 when I'm watching this musical, but having the army guy say ""America is Great Again"" after he was assimilated is an obvious Trump reference.

I do not care for Trump. I don't know StarKid's political leanings, but I really liked the message behind Twisted, of being kind to others and using government to help the people, not enrich yourself. Trump is diametrically opposed to that message. TGWDLM isn't very political at all, so I felt some whiplash when they basically linked the badguys to Trump in the musical. I just didn't feel like thinking about Trump while trying to enjoy some media. But that could have still been fine... if the badguy's hadn't won

I wouldn't have liked the downer ending anyway, granted. I was expecting Paul's hatred of musicals to pay off making him able to resist them, or maybe it would look like they got to him, and he'd do a musical number, but then it would be revealed he still hates musicals and fought them off and he was just pretending to be assimilated. I didn't expect him to lose, and it to feel like the Trump-linked badguys won. I feel like I already see that happening all the time in the real world, I don't need to be reminded of it in a musical.

It has some great songs. The concept is clever and I recognize how someone else could like it. But it's just not for me. 

OK, so with all that said, here's my new rankings:

# A Tier

1. Twisted - A Masterpiece
2. VHSCC - Also a masterpiece! Really only in #2 because it's so short, and because Twisted contains a more original plot. (I haven't seen the longer one yet!)

# B Tier

1. Firebringer - It's got problems, but has one of my favorite songs and the spoken portions have some great running bits. This one is really hanging around in my head rent-free and may have to get moved to A-tier.
2. Cinderella's Castle - A few minor problems preventing it from going to A tier, but overall an amazing production. More than any other StarKid musical, I wish I'd seen it live.
3. Trail to Oregon - Hilarious, but no earworms.

# D Tier

1k6rwgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1k6rwgh/you_can_mix_different_coffee_beans_in_your_moka/,You can mix different coffee beans in your moka pot.,"For the last 5 years I have been a coffee lover and a barista and I loooove the individual character of coffees of different origins. But I believe that, unlike espresso and pour-over, a moka pot is not the best tool for revealing the most subtle things in aroma and taste. Moka pot as a method adds something of its own and tends to blur the most subtle subtleties. Maybe it is related to temperature or grind size, or some other factors, I will not pretend to understand all the processes in a moka in an attempt to rationalize these observations. But these observations are fairly consistent. 

What is the strength of the moka pot is that it brings out the inner deep flavor. You get a lot of coffee in your coffee. You may not get the taste of the farm, but you will get a lot of the general taste of the country. And in this sense, making blends for your moka is a good idea. These deep, general flavors blend well and don't blur each other. And often they can produce some new interesting quality.

 You can also ""correct"" or balance your coffee beans. For example, I recently had pretty basic cheap natural Guatemala roasted for espresso and overall it was quite sweet, but gave a slight unpleasant bitterness at the edge. I made a dose of 11 grams of this Guatemala and added 4 grams of cheap filter roasted Kenya AB and this bitterness disappeared, instead of it there was a slight taste of Kenyan fruit tartness.

It was magnificent. I got the body and sweetness of a Mesoamerican coffee and dressed it up with Kenyan character. And all this from fairly simple and cheap coffee beans.",2,1745500452.0,mokapot,13,0.6,False

Hey Mom, Dad‚Äî And, uh, hello to my future wife and hypothetical kids (if you‚Äôre digging through old transmissions one day)!

Just wanted to let you all know I made it up here safe. Pisistratus Station is‚Ä¶ well, let‚Äôs call it ‚Äúindustrial chic.‚Äù My habitation cell‚Äôs about the size of my old freshman dorm‚Äîminus the window, minus the door handle, and plus a constant low hum I haven‚Äôt quite figured out yet. Still, it‚Äôs home for now, and I can't complain.

Before we docked, I got a glimpse of the platform. I had no idea how massive it would be. The whole base is built into this rotating ring system‚Äîlike a wheel half-buried in the dark side of the moon. They said it turns at a fixed rate to create a centrifugal force that simulates Earth‚Äôs gravity. You can‚Äôt feel the rotation from inside, but knowing it's happening gives you this weird sense of motion in the back of your brain. The size of the platform blew me away‚Äîit must be at least a kilometer wide, maybe more. They didn‚Äôt really cover *that* in the training videos. It‚Äôs like living in a giant, quiet machine.

Sorry for the short notice on the departure. Once the company pushed us through our specialization certs, things moved *fast*. One day you‚Äôre learning how to realign hydraulic lock seals in VR, and the next you‚Äôre vacuum-sealed into a shuttle bound for the far side of the Moon. They gave us a week‚Äîenough time to pack a duffel, sign a few papers, and say goodbye without thinking too hard.

Don‚Äôt worry though‚ÄîI'll make sure to snag some moonrocks for everyone. Maybe even some deeper core samples if I get in good with the miners. Some of them are already swapping stories about weird strata shifts and mineral anomalies‚Äîjust harmless tall tales, I‚Äôm sure.

I‚Äôve got orientation briefings in the morning‚Äîstation safety, maintenance protocols, door calibration standards. Nothing too wild. I‚Äôll send more when I get a better lay of the place.

Love you all. Tell the dog I miss him.

Alrighty‚Äîhope everyone‚Äôs cozy back home, tucked in, maybe sipping coffee or watching something dumb on TV. Up here‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs still night. Technically.

I found out that the far side of the Moon doesn‚Äôt really *do* mornings. When we docked, they told us it was ‚Äúnight‚Äù. Turns out, we‚Äôve got another ten days of darkness to go. Fourteen days of night. Fourteen of daylight. Like a celestial switch.

And the telescope? Yeah, you can forget that‚Äîthis side of the Moon never faces Earth. Not even a shimmer. Something to do with the rotation rate of the Earth and Moon mixed with their orbits. It‚Äôs just black sky and stars out there. Honestly, it‚Äôs beautiful, but it also feels‚Ä¶ heavy. Like the whole sky‚Äôs pressing in.

Anyway, I promised you updates, so here we go. Today‚Äôs briefing was actually kind of awesome. We learned why the station‚Äôs named *Pisistratus*. He was some old-school Athenian leader‚Äîbenevolent, they said. Supposedly ushered in a golden age, redistributed land from the elites to the common people, built up the arts and the temples.

I guess that‚Äôs why so many of us are up here. Not just scientists, not just astronauts‚Äînormal people. Mechanics, janitors, miners. I might be the only one in my habitation sector with a degree, and it doesn‚Äôt even matter. That‚Äôs kind of the magic of this place‚Äîeveryone‚Äôs useful. Everyone has a job.

The miners especially‚Äîrough folks, but some of the highest-paid up here. They say the core‚Äôs rich with rare isotopes. Stuff you can‚Äôt even find in Earth‚Äôs crust anymore. I heard a guy say one of the new mines has veins that *pulse*‚Äîprobably just a figure of speech. Right?

I got my assignment! I‚Äôll be stationed near the western airlocks, just off the corridor leading to Mine 7B. It‚Äôs a quieter sector‚Äîlower traffic. I monitor a bank of cameras, run diagnostics, cycle door tests. Six doors, one tech, one long hallway.

Honestly? I‚Äôm excited. There‚Äôs something kind of peaceful about it out there. Real quiet.

Anyway, more tomorrow. Love you guys.

Hey guys. Sorry I didn‚Äôt get a message out yesterday‚Äîit was‚Ä¶ kind of a whirlwind. Spent most of the day clearing out my little office nook near the West Wing airlocks.

You know, I figured everything up here would be sleek, futuristic, that kind of thing. But honestly? Some of my equipment feels like it belongs in a museum. My camera monitors are chunky old CRT-style boxes‚Äîno touchscreens, no fancy heads-up displays. The feeds are weirdly grainy too, with this low hum in the background. Like they‚Äôre running off‚Ä¶ older tech, I guess. I even had to dust some of them off.

Controls are tactile‚Äîclunky switches, big metal toggles. Kind of retro, which would be charming if there weren‚Äôt serious cases where a door could cycle improperly, and all of our oxygen is sucked out.

Yesterday I had to do a servo repair on Door 3. Nothing too wild, but it was different from what the crash course taught us. Wiring was off. Slightly older schematic. Still‚Äîpressurized doors are pressurized doors, right?

Today was quieter. Almost peaceful. I considered walking back to my habitation cell early and writing this, but I stayed in the office and fiddled with the terminal a bit.

Good news‚ÄîI got one of the IT guys, Ethan, to help me clean up the interface. He‚Äôs only been here a couple months longer than me, but he‚Äôs sharp. Showed me a bunch of back-end menus, some override protocols I didn‚Äôt know I had access to. Emergency lockdowns, remote seals‚Äîsome of it felt... above my clearance, if I‚Äôm being honest.

He said it‚Äôs standard now, that they updated things a while back. But the way he said ‚Äúupdated‚Äù was weird. Like the system's been layered over *something older*.

Honestly, the computers themselves run pretty quick. Maybe they‚Äôve just got new guts inside old shells. Kind of getting the feeling that it‚Äôs how it is with this whole station, now that I think about it.

On a lighter note‚Äîcafeteria absolutely *slapped* today. Real apple pie. Not rehydrated, not vacuum-sealed‚Äîactual, warm, fragrant pie. I was sitting there wondering if that technically makes it a moonpie up here. Or‚Ä¶ maybe a moonpie up here would just be called a pie and the ones back home are the frauds? Got caught in that loop for a while.

Anyway, I‚Äôm clocking out soon. Crew from Mine 7B‚Äôs scheduled to return tomorrow. I‚Äôll be on door control‚Äîopen, cycle, seal. Easy stuff.

Gotta stay rested, even if all I‚Äôm doing is pushing buttons. Love you guys always.

Okay. Today was cool, but I have some questions.

The mining crew came back a little early‚Äînot an issue. The outer door camera showed them pulling up in the large buggy with a bag about the size of me, probably stuffed with ore and rare minerals. It looked‚Ä¶ uncanny, the way they hopped toward the airlock platform with the bag drifting behind the guy carrying it. Like it was deadweight, but not *heavy*.

They keyed in the activation code, then radioed the keyphrase to my room, and I hit the confirmation. The base‚Äôs announcement system echoed through the halls, alerting everyone to the gravity shift. The low hum of the station‚Äôs rotation slowed until it stopped, locking into position with the platform.

Two of the miners lifted the bag as they entered. Cycling began‚Äîoxygen restored, pressure stabilized. Then centrifugal rotation spun back up. Gravity settled.

That‚Äôs when one of the miners lost his grip.

His side of the bag dropped to the floor with a force I could *feel* through the feed. There‚Äôs no sound on the cameras, but I swear I heard the thud in my chest. A dark liquid sprayed out across his boots and pooled fast.

It was thick. Not hydraulic fluid. Not oil. Something else.

Within seconds, Research techs in yellow badges were sprinting past my hallway viewport with a cart. I glanced back to the monitor just in time to see them load the bag‚Äîquick, methodical. Way too smooth to be their first time.

I stood to get a better look as they wheeled it past my window. Down the hall. Out of sight.

No one said a word about it. Not during check-in. Not in the logs.

I know it‚Äôs probably nothing. Ore can leak, right?

I hope nothing poisonous was in the liquid that got on the floor, but they cleaned it up pretty quickly, so I‚Äôm sure it's safe.

Anyway‚Äîtonight I swapped out my bedding and noticed a huge black, maybe brownish, stain on the mattress underneath. The look of it reminded me of the leak from the bag.

So, three things:My bed‚Äôs been used and the stain looks pretty fuckin old. Two‚Äîthe mining crews are supposed to work in teams of six. Only three came in with that bag. And three‚ÄîI hadn‚Äôt really thought about it until now, but‚Ä¶ why do they need both a code *and* a keyphrase just for me to let them in?

Why lock a door that tightly unless there‚Äôs something we‚Äôre trying to keep out?

Time to sleep before I overthink it. This kind of stuff is above my pay grade. Love you.

So‚Ä¶ two more of the crew came back today?

They didn‚Äôt have a vehicle. I watched them almost robotically leap across the lunarscape toward the keypad podium. No buggy, no extra gear. Just the two of them, silhouetted against the black horizon.

They keyed in the code and gave the keyphrase over the radio‚Äîquiet, raspy, almost like their comms were breaking up. I hit the confirmation key.

The announcement sounded, gravity slowed, oxygen cycled, they came in.

Fifteen minutes later, my supervisor shows up. Doesn‚Äôt knock, doesn‚Äôt greet me‚Äîjust asks why I stopped the centrifuge.

I told him about the crew, the radio call, the docking procedure. He just‚Ä¶ stared at me. Like I‚Äôd said something wrong. Then turned around and walked out before I could even ask.

I watched him cross the corridor outside my window at a brisk, determined pace, speaking into his radio the whole way.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong‚ÄîI was worried. Still am. But no one‚Äôs said anything. Not to me, anyway.

It‚Äôs been a few hours now, and we just entered a lockdown drill.

Except they *really* stressed that we treat it like the real thing.

Doors sealed, motion lights off, auxiliary power only. No one in or out.

Something about the phrasing‚Äîthe tone‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt just a drill. It felt more like a warning.

They don‚Äôt come out as much when the sunlight hits the exterior corridors. I think the windows‚Äîthose thick, curved panes‚Äîact like traps.

They just stop and stare, motionless, when the beams catch them.

But the inner corridors? The ones without windows?

No light reaches there.

There‚Äôs no stopping them there.

The bigger rooms‚Äîthe ones with skylights‚Äîwere safer.

For a time.

I managed to reach Ethan from IT on the short-range comms link in my office. A few times.

While he was still alive‚Ä¶

The last time we spoke, he said he‚Äôd been sleeping in the hydroponics atrium during the lightshift. That dome gets full sun exposure during the light days.

It kept him safe from the things.

We didn‚Äôt talk often, but early on, he told me enough to make some guesses.

The team leads. The high-clearance personnel.

They‚Äôre not on base anymore.

I remember it now‚Äîclear as day.

The night of the lockdown, I was already in bed when the alert came through: **Centrifugal Halt ‚Äì Platform Synchronization Inbound.**

I thought it was just another drill. I waited for the hum to return. For the soft sway of gravity to resume.

But it never came back.

Ethan told me later that week. He saw it‚Äîthrough a corridor window after he‚Äôd cracked open his cell door.

The Emergency Return shuttle lifted off from the south platform.

While we were still in full stop.

They left us here.

*All of us.*

Before I knew any of that, I‚Äôd already floated back to my office‚Äîhalf an hour of low-G silence behind me. Something felt wrong, even though I hadn‚Äôt yet realized the shuttle had left.

I keyed in my credentials. Accessed the override protocols.

I started by checking why the centrifuge hadn‚Äôt restarted. Why the platform hadn‚Äôt cycled.

But then I saw it.

The south platform wasn‚Äôt the only door with an administrator override.

The research corridors glowed orange‚Äîpathing active. Three internal doors were blinking red.

Not cycled.

Locked shut.

The only way to clear an administrator override is with a full facility reset.

That would cycle every exterior door. Re-engage gravity. And unlock every single pressurized passage across the station.

I didn‚Äôt do it.

But someone else did.

Another door tech, I‚Äôm sure.

I‚Äôm not responsible for this.

I understood what it meant when I saw the research facility manually locked down.

I understood.

Something was in the station that we couldn‚Äôt let spread.

When all of the doors unlocked, they clambered out.

Shambling *humanthings*.

I‚Äôve seen them in person now.

Incomprehensibly grotesque.

Rotted. Necrotic. Elongated joints, with hanging jaws and stringy hair.

They move like they‚Äôre searching.

Like they‚Äôre remembering.

I know they‚Äôre remembering.

Because Ethan still comes to the locked door at the end of corridor R

‚Ä¶and stares through the camera.

Straight at me. I can see his mouth moving, rambling, but I won‚Äôt go near the door.

I have to go for now.

Without many of the engineers, the station's gone into auto-backup mode. A few generators are about to cycle on in a couple minutes.

And even though I‚Äôve locked off the corridors between my cell and my office‚Ä¶ When that noise kicks up, they get agitated.

I‚Äôve got a little crawlspace behind a panel in the office I hide in, in case one of them manages to open a door again.

Pray.

¬†**>>PERSONAL LOG: LEON R.**

 I wasn‚Äôt supposed to find this. But I did.

For days now, I‚Äôve been unlocking and relocking the admin corridors‚Äîwatching, waiting. The human things, they don‚Äôt remember their paths. They wander, bumping into walls or sealed doors, some drifting into new hallways before I shut them off. There‚Äôs one that drags a broken leg behind it, like a sack of tools. I timed its circuit through Sector D. When it was far enough down the hall, I made my move.

The door to Administrator Roan‚Äôs office was locked with a four-tier system‚Äîno easy bypass. I‚Äôve cracked two before‚Äîmaintenance overrides buried in the diagnostic logs. But this one‚Ä¶ it had a special key gate.

I thought I was screwed. Then I remembered something: Roan‚Äôs quarters.

I wasn‚Äôt shocked to find a few administrators left behind. The station layout, combined with the timing of the outbreak and subsequent evacuation, made it feel inevitable. What I didn‚Äôt expect was what I found in Roan‚Äôs quarters.

Her facility suit lay discarded on the floor, the remains of her body still inside, like she‚Äôd been eaten from the inside out. The suit‚Äôs fabric clung to her like a half-formed cocoon, and what was left of her‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even know how to describe it. Soft tissue, sloshing in my hands. I had to pry her keycard free from the inner lining of the forearm. It took a few minutes‚Äîand a lot of gagging‚Äîbut I got it.

When I made it back to the office and slotted the card into the master terminal, I thought it was all over. I was wrong.

That‚Äôs when I saw it.

A system-wide communications lockdown had been enacted during the final centrifuge cycle, just before the Emergency Return shuttle launched. Personal comms had been rerouted. Every outgoing message from standard personnel accounts was flagged as ‚Äúnonessential‚Äù and dumped into a queue.

They‚Äôre all still here.

Every message. Every cry for help.

Not just mine. Hundreds of them.

Audio. Video. Text logs. Some people were still recording even after the power started to fail in their sections.

Some of the messages are just static and sobbing. Others... Some of them talk about things that don‚Äôt make sense. Worse than what I‚Äôve seen.

There are names I don‚Äôt recognize. One man‚Äîsecurity, I think‚Äîkept saying he heard them whispering in the walls. That they knew his name. And that they remembered him.

I opened my own log queue. It was there. Everything I‚Äôve said to you. None of it ever left Pisistratus Station.

I sat there for a long time. Listening. To everyone. To no one.

There‚Äôs a backup transmission command on Roan‚Äôs computer. A hardline. The problem is, I have a list of thousands of servers to send transmissions to. I can manually clear the queue of each flagged log, but I don‚Äôt know which servers to send them to.

I think I have no choice but to send everything out. I‚Äôm hoping for help. I‚Äôm unable to establish a direct line to Earth‚Äîevery company line seems halted. I believe we were told that each transmission takes a week to reach Earth.

So, tomorrow, I‚Äôll send everything out. Today, I‚Äôll reroute some doors, maybe raid the cafeteria again. I should be good for months if I stay quiet.

I love you, Mom. Dad. I‚Äôll be home soon. ‚Äì Leon

1k6rvwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1k6rvwu/i_hate_having_a_car_and_driving/,I hate having a car and driving,"About a year ago, I moved to an area where it's impossible to get around without owning a car and driving, and it's making me miserable. Everyone insisted that learning how to drive would bring me more freedom, but instead I feel so stifled and trapped. Being dependent on a car for me has just been a ceaseless, never-ending drain on my mental health and finances. Every week brings some kind of new, car related drama. Maintenance, other people's shitty driving, my own limited driving abilities, tedious and time consuming bureaucracy, road and weather conditions, fluctuating gas prices and repair prices, limited parking in most places, I could literally go on forever. Just the action of leaving my house, regardless of what I'm doing, has become a stressful chore, and I find myself just doing a lot less fun things because it doesn't feel worth it. 

I also just feel less able to take care of myself. Like about a month ago, I went through a period where I felt really weak and lightheaded for days. It wasn't that bad, but after about three days of feeling my legs wobble every time I got up, I was starting to get a little worried. I didn't feel safe enough to drive. Normally, I would just hop on a bus to a walk-in clinic at this point, but that's no longer an option. Turns out I was just getting the flu, but what if it had been something more serious and I had no way of getting medical help?

I miss just being able to go for a walk. I miss getting a coffee while I wait for the bus and spacing out while looking out the window. I miss having random interactions with strangers instead of being sequestered in a steel death trap. I miss paying $36 dollars a month for a bus and knowing that there will be no other transportation related expenses for the rest of the month. I miss being able to run out to the corner store no matter how tired, sick or out-of-it I felt, or how bad the weather was. I miss having outdoor time be part of my daily routine instead of something that I consciously have to plan for. 

Just when I think I'm kind of getting used to it, something new happens. Yesterday, I was leaving work late, feeling absolutely exhausted and worried about my dog who was home alone for longer than usual. I was reversing out of my parking spot and snagged the front bumper on some farm equipment, nearly ripping half of it off. I should have remembered it was there, but it was low to the ground and I didn't see it behind the front of my car. I feel so frustrated and so embarrassed. I'm ashamed to see my co-workers again.

Today I have some errands to run but I just dread getting back into my car. I have another 7 months in this area before I can even think about moving, and I don't know how I'm going to make it through until then. I know that for most people, driving is completely normal thing that everyone does, and it's seen as a sign of incompetence and immaturity if you haven't mastered this relatively basic skill, but I felt so much more confident, independent and grown up back when I didn't have a license. 

I know I must seem really silly to a lot of people, but I feel so defeated right now. If anyone has literally anything supportive or encouraging to say, I could really use the help.",1,1745500408.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

We bicker, but then have the cognitive wherewithal to recognize what the issue is and talk it through calmly. That would never have been the case 667 days ago. The smallest ‚Äòtone‚Äô sensed in an argument would have been the catalyst to an emotional knockdown. Not today.

When something bad happens, I can feel it and process it clearly. Being sad is still a form of peace, minus the chaos alcohol would add.

**Dan ‚Äì POV**

As I sat in the conference room, the lights low and the ship humming quietly around me, I thought back over the day.

Nixten, becoming a Willholder.

Sparring with him in one of the new suits.

Seeing Ren sync live for the first time.

Yeah. It‚Äôd been a day.

A weird, chaotic, exhausting day. But a good one.

I leaned back in the chair, staring at the ceiling with a faint smile.

‚ÄúIf only I had a cup of coffee right now,‚Äù I muttered, ‚ÄúI might actually call this a good day.‚Äù

The door hissed open, and Zixder walked in, holding a stack of documents under one arm.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I called out, giving him a casual wave.



Zixder gave a nod and dropped the stack onto the table with a soft *thud*. ‚ÄúStatus reports. Damage assessments. Supply logs. You know‚Äîeveryone‚Äôs favorite light reading.‚Äù

I snorted. ‚ÄúOh, joy. Can‚Äôt wait to curl up with those tonight.‚Äù

He pulled out a chair across from me and sat down, ears twitching slightly as he scanned the top page. For a second, we were quiet‚Äîjust the gentle hum of the ship around us.

Then he looked up. ‚ÄúWe need to talk about the next move.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, leaning back in my chair. ‚ÄúI figured we‚Äôd get there eventually.‚Äù

Zixder pushed a datapad toward me.



Earlier today, I mentioned we‚Äôd need to send out an FTL probe to try and catch up with the main Moslnoss fleet‚Äîthe last remnants still running.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, leaning back in my chair. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see where we‚Äôre at.‚Äù

‚ÄúZen,‚Äù I called out.

Her avatar appeared at the front of the briefing room.

And this time? It wasn‚Äôt casual Zen. No rabbit hoodie. No side smirk.

This was her full command avatar. Black and red Wing Guard uniform, perfectly crisp, the Zo Squad badge gleaming on her chest.

The moment I saw it, my stomach dropped. One look said it all: **it was bad.**



I let out a slow breath. ‚ÄúAlright, Zen. Hit me. What happened?‚Äù

Without a word, she gestured. The lights dimmed as a star map flickered into existence in the center of the room, showing our local system. Planets, orbital rings, and tagged paths. Red lines marked known Seeker patrol patterns. A blinking blue dot marked **us**‚Äîcurrently floating in the Graveyard, between the third and fourth planet.

‚ÄúAs you know,‚Äù she began, her tone sharp and formal, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre here‚Äîcoordinating repairs and regrouping after pulling the Seekers off-course. The we took the time to continue fixing our systems.‚Äù

Zixder nodded. ‚ÄúWe were supposed to have at least nine days of lead time.‚Äù

Zen‚Äôs face didn‚Äôt change. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what we estimated. But‚Ä¶ they‚Äôll be here in **four**.‚Äù

I sat up. ‚ÄúFour? That‚Äôs not possible. They need time to turn around. They were halfway to the rim.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey shouldn‚Äôt have been able to pivot that fast,‚Äù Zen agreed. ‚ÄúBut they did. As soon as our power grid came back online, they performed a hard reversal. No hesitation. No inertia drift. Just a full 180-degree course correction‚Äîstraight back toward us.‚Äù

Zixder growled. ‚ÄúThat makes no sense. They don‚Äôt have engines strong enough to break momentum like that. Not unless‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúUnless they don‚Äôt use engines,‚Äù I said slowly.

Zen gave me a sharp look. ‚ÄúExactly what I‚Äôve been analyzing.‚Äù

She flicked her hand, and a schematic of one of the Seeker drones replaced the star map. The 3D model slowly rotated in the air, highlighting components with glowing markers.

‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt fully understand how they work,‚Äù she admitted, ‚Äúbut I think they‚Äôre using monopole magnets in their central core. They‚Äôre not flying in the traditional sense. They‚Äôre‚Ä¶ falling.‚Äù

‚ÄúFalling?‚Äù Zixder frowned.

‚ÄúIn the direction of their choice,‚Äù Zen clarified. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt push. They don‚Äôt thrust. They create directional force by altering the local magnetic fields. Like snapping to gravity wells. Except they‚Äôre making the wells themselves.‚Äù

I leaned back in my chair, tension running down my spine. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why they can change direction like that. It‚Äôs not propulsion. It‚Äôs control.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd worse,‚Äù Zen added, her voice darkening, ‚Äúthey didn‚Äôt just turn around. They turned around the moment our power came back online.‚Äù

Zixder stiffened. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre tracking our signatures.‚Äù

‚ÄúOr worse,‚Äù I muttered. ‚ÄúThey were waiting.‚Äù



I looked at Zen, the glowing maps still hovering behind her. ‚ÄúSo, Zen‚Ä¶ are we going to make it?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt answer right away.

‚ÄúLast time we ran the numbers,‚Äù I continued, ‚Äúwe estimated at least three more days to get everything ready‚Äîus and the rest of the fleet.‚Äù

Her posture shifted slightly, her voice a little softer now.

‚ÄúThanks to Ren,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm no longer handling the load alone. With her taking over half of my processing strain, I‚Äôve been able to double-task the fabrication queues.‚Äù

She flicked her fingers, and a new status window opened. Colored bars and progress tags scrolled across the screen.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre pushing hard. Repairs are ahead of schedule. Fabrication lines are running full tilt. We‚Äôre pulling spare parts, plating, and missile cores from the nearby derelict field.‚Äù

Zixder let out a low whistle. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gutting the whole zone.‚Äù

Zen nodded. ‚ÄúAnd the mechs‚ÄîBlitzfire and Syren? Full rebuild and refit. They‚Äôll both be operational by tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, sorry about that,‚Äù I said, glancing over at Blitzfire on the charts.

Zen gave me a look. ‚ÄúYou know going full burn mode means days in the shop... and a mountain of replacement parts, right?‚Äù



I exhaled‚Äîslow, careful.

It wasn‚Äôt a win yet. But it wasn‚Äôt doom, either.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Then we just might have a chance,‚Äù I said.

Zen gave a faint smile. ‚ÄúWe just might.‚Äù



‚ÄúOh‚Äîand one more thing,‚Äù Zen added, looking around the room.

‚ÄúAs you know, DLFs can process time a *lot* faster than organics. And Ren? She‚Äôs already run through the full handling protocols for a Zo mech. On top of that, she‚Äôs massively upgraded from her old armored doll unit.‚Äù

Zixder blinked. ‚ÄúWait‚Äîwhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Zen confirmed, her tone calm but impressed. ‚ÄúIn the few hours she‚Äôs been aboard, she‚Äôs completed a full crash course on piloting a Zo-class. Her core processing speed, paired with her combat AI origins, gave her a huge advantage.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve got another potential Zo pilot now,‚Äù I said.

There was a long pause.

‚ÄúThat fast?‚Äù Zixder muttered.

I nodded. ‚ÄúThat fast.‚Äù

But I didn‚Äôt stop there. I turned to Zen and met her eyes.

‚ÄúJust make sure she knows,‚Äù I said quietly, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs not just a weapon we use.‚Äù

Zen held my gaze for a moment, then nodded once.

‚ÄúI will.‚Äù



‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ which one‚Äôs Ren piloting?‚Äù I asked.

Zen turned toward me, arms crossed, expression smug. ‚ÄúRains‚Äô old unit.‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúWait‚Äî*the* Zephyr Shot?‚Äù

She nodded. ‚ÄúYep. The sniper frame. The one that can one-shot a dreadnought from across the system.‚Äù

I let out a low whistle. ‚ÄúWith the B.A.G.‚Äù

Zixder raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúBig. Ass. Gun.‚Äù

I explained to him.

She stepped forward, the faintest smirk tugging at her mouth. ‚ÄúThat mech‚Äôs designed for extreme long-range precision‚Äîtotal battlefield control. And at mid-range? Still deadly.‚Äù

I glanced at her. ‚ÄúCompared to her old armored doll body?‚Äù

Zen didn‚Äôt miss a beat. ‚ÄúThis thing outclasses it in *every* way.‚Äù



I slapped my knee, laughing. ‚ÄúOh my god‚Äî*Rains*, who spent *years* trying to claw her way to the top of the pilot charts to prove she could outdo a DLF, and now her mech is in the hands of a DLF!‚Äù

‚ÄúRains?‚Äù Zixder asked, looking puzzled.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, still grinning. ‚ÄúHer full name was *Rains Down Fire*. The second-best pilot we had. And she *never* let anyone forget it.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe ever outranked Zen?‚Äù he asked, curious.

I nodded. ‚ÄúOnce. Barely. For like, three weeks. You‚Äôd have thought she won the galaxy. She even had a custom jacket made.‚Äù

Zen groaned. ‚ÄúI *remember* that jacket.‚Äù

I chuckled. ‚ÄúAnd now? Her prized mech? Piloted by someone who wasn‚Äôt even on the board yesterday.‚Äù

Zen just smirked. ‚ÄúLife‚Äôs funny like that.‚Äù



Yup,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúShe was always gunning for my spot too, but she never quite made it.‚Äù

I turned. ‚ÄúHey, Zen‚Äîyou still have the old rankings?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course I do,‚Äù she said, and with a flick of her hand, a holo display lit up in front of us.

**Top 5 Zo Pilots**

**1. Chain dog** ‚Äì 12,525 points

**2. Rains Down Fire** ‚Äì 11,948 points

**3. Zeneth32** ‚Äì 10,977 points

**4. Rax Up-Kills** ‚Äì 9,738 points

**5. Loon** ‚Äì 8,263 points

I stared at the list. A rush of old memories hit me like a wave.

‚ÄúMan,‚Äù I murmured. ‚ÄúFeels like another lifetime.‚Äù

Zen‚Äôs voice was softer now. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because it was.‚Äù



‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I added with a smirk, ‚ÄúLoon would‚Äôve ranked higher if he didn‚Äôt crash his mech every three missions.‚Äù

Zen grunted. ‚ÄúStill impressive he made it to the top five at all.‚Äù

I leaned back in my chair, hands behind my head. ‚ÄúAlright. That leaves us with two goals.‚Äù

Everyone in the room looked up.

‚ÄúOne: get that FTL probe out of the system so we can send help to the main bulk of the Moslnoss fleet.‚Äù

I held up a second finger.

‚ÄúAnd two: try really, really hard not to die when the main Seeker force shows up knocking.‚Äù

Silence.

Then Zen‚Äôs avatar, deadpan: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a solid plan. Thorough. Inspirational.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I said, smirking, ‚ÄúI work with what I‚Äôve got.‚Äù



Okay, all jokes aside‚Ä¶‚Äù I leaned forward, eyes narrowing at the system map as it popped back up. ‚ÄúWe need to figure out *how* we‚Äôre going to pull this off.‚Äù

The room quieted, all eyes on the floating projection.

I stared at it the way I always do‚Äîlike it was a real-time strategy game. Gridlines. Unit paths. Terrain advantages. I scanned the planets, letting my mind chew on the possibilities until something clicked.

My eyes landed on the fifth planet‚Äîthe biggest one in the system.

‚ÄúWait a second‚Ä¶‚Äù I muttered, pointing. ‚ÄúZen, earlier you said the Seekers use mono-pole magnetics to move, right? That they don‚Äôt fly‚Äîthey *fall*?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said, cocking her head. ‚ÄúThey fall in the direction they choose.‚Äù

I kept my gaze on the fifth planet, something sparking in my head.

‚ÄúSo what happens,‚Äù I asked slowly, ‚Äúif there‚Äôs a *bigger* magnet nearby?‚Äù

She followed my line of sight to the massive planet‚Ä¶ and then her eyes lit up.

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù

A grin crept onto her face. ‚ÄúIf they get too close‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúThey fall,‚Äù I finished. ‚ÄúHard.‚Äù



‚ÄúThat means there‚Äôs a safe zone,‚Äù I said, tapping the display. ‚ÄúAssuming you don‚Äôt mind all the radiation a planet that big puts out.‚Äù

‚ÄúZen,‚Äù I called. ‚ÄúPull up the planet to the center of the table.‚Äù

Her avatar nodded, and the holographic map shifted‚Äîzooming in until the massive fifth planet dominated the center display.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see‚Ä¶‚Äù she murmured, running calculations. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about ten percent larger than Jupiter. Constant storms. Massive magnetic interference. And radiation levels that would fry most unshielded systems.‚Äù

Zixder blinked at the size of it. ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ are you seriously saying the *Revanessa* can survive diving into a gas giant?‚Äù

‚ÄúKind of,‚Äù I said, scratching the back of my head. ‚ÄúShe can survive going *about* twenty miles into the upper gas layers before it gets too dangerous.‚Äù

Zen nodded. ‚ÄúCorrect. Twenty miles in is the limit. Beyond that, gravity becomes too strong and we won‚Äôt be able to climb back out. The shielding can protect us at that depth‚Äîbut none of the smaller ships will survive it. Not without serious reinforcement.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶‚Äù I looked back at the map. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a magnet the size of a god, and a ship just tough enough to dip its toes in and not die.‚Äù

Zixder folded his arms, ears twitching. ‚ÄúLet me guess‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre gonna hide there.‚Äù

I grinned.

‚ÄúNot just hide. We‚Äôre gonna make them chase us in.‚Äù



‚ÄúSo here‚Äôs the plan,‚Äù I said, tapping the edge of the holo-map.

‚ÄúWe give some of our FTL probes to the Moslnoss ships‚Äîget them positioned to launch once they‚Äôre in pursuit range. Meanwhile, *we* draw the Seekers to us. Hard.‚Äù

I pointed to the gap between the third and fourth planets.

‚ÄúWe pull as much heat as we can‚Äîjust enough to punch a hole wide enough for the rest of the fleet to slip past while the Seekers are focused on tearing us apart. Then, once we‚Äôve got their attention‚Ä¶‚Äù

I flicked my eyes to the gas giant.

‚ÄúWe do a fighting retreat straight into that monster. The Revanessa dips in just enough to survive. The smaller ships stay above, close but not too close. If they follow us in, their momentum becomes their enemy. If they don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ we buy enough time for everyone else to get out.‚Äù

I paused.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not perfect. It‚Äôs insane. But it might be our best shot.‚Äù

I looked around the room.

‚ÄúIf anyone‚Äôs got a better idea‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm all ears.‚Äù



And you‚Äôre sure this ship can handle it?‚Äù Zixder asked, arms crossed, eyes locked on the swirling gas giant projected on the table.

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶‚Äù I leaned back slightly. ‚ÄúIt *did* start as a gas collector. The Revanessa was designed to dive into atmospheres like that, back when she was a deep-harvest vessel.‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúAnd hey‚Äîwe do need to restock some of those gases for fuel and life support. So we‚Äôd be killing two birds with one extremely terrifying plunge.‚Äù

Zen nodded, her projection flickering with approval. ‚ÄúThe outer layers are survivable for this ship. But everything will need to be locked down tight. One breach, and we‚Äôre toast.‚Äù

Zixder let out a slow breath, tail flicking once. ‚ÄúGreat. So our plan is to bait a death fleet, make them chase us into a floating apocalypse, and hope our old ship remembers how to breathe gas.‚Äù

I grinned. ‚ÄúPretty much.‚Äù



‚ÄúLook,‚Äù I said, scanning the room, ‚Äúif anyone doesn‚Äôt want to go through with this, I‚Äôm sure the mice wouldn‚Äôt mind giving you a ride out. We can arrange an escort. Nobody‚Äôs being forced into this.‚Äù

Zixder looked at me, firm and steady. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the captain of this ship,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhere it goes‚ÄîI go too.‚Äù

I gave him a slow nod. ‚ÄúThe offer still stands,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIf you change your mind later, no shame in it.‚Äù



‚ÄúSo, Zen,‚Äù I said, glancing up at her avatar, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm guessing the rest of the crew‚Äôs listening in?‚Äù

She chuckled. ‚ÄúLike kids with glasses to the door,‚Äù she said, already pulling up the comms log. ‚ÄúYeah, they‚Äôre tuned in‚Äîand caught red-handed.‚Äù

Messages started flooding in.

**Kale:** *‚ÄúIs it bad that I‚Äôm excited? Like, it‚Äôs chaos, but I love it. I‚Äôve always wanted to see what it‚Äôd be like inside a gas giant.‚Äù*

**Doc:** *‚ÄúWarning: Radiating heat and magnetic pressure will be lethal to most organic lifeforms. Just something to keep in mind before we start joyriding through Jupiter 2.0.‚Äù*

**Nixten:** *‚ÄúI just became a Willholder, and now I‚Äôm gonna die immediately afterward?! Great. Perfect. Love that.‚Äù*

**Callie:** ‚ÄúWell, if we‚Äôre going out, we better look good doing it. I‚Äôm already prepping emergency kits. No one panics on my watch.‚Äù

**Sires:** Why did I sign up for this crew‚Ä¶? Well‚Äîno use complaining now.‚Äù

**Nellya:**¬†¬†‚ÄúOkay, if we‚Äôre doing this‚Ä¶ I want all of you to know‚ÄîI‚Äôm sticking with this pack. No matter what.‚Äù

**Ren:** ‚ÄúCan I request a heat shield made of actual common sense? No? Okay, worth a shot.‚Äù

Zen just smiled, her avatar flickering slightly as she scrolled through the chaos.

‚ÄúSee?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre nervous. But they‚Äôre still with us.‚Äù

I leaned back in my chair, watching the messages scroll by, one after another‚Äîsarcastic, heartfelt, ridiculous, and real.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Yeah,‚Äù I murmured. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre still with us.‚Äù



‚ÄúYep,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúA plan is coming together.‚Äù

1k6rn0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1k6rn0l/how_to_find_your_first_customer/,How to Find Your First Customer,"Landing your first sale or client can feel a bit like the first time you approached someone on the dance floor‚Äîawkward, sweaty palms, and a desperate hope that you don‚Äôt step on their toes. But fear not! Let‚Äôs break down some practical tips to make this experience a little less like a scene out of a romantic comedy gone wrong and more like a smooth waltz.

1. **Network Like a Pro**: Think of networking as building a community rather than just collecting business cards. You‚Äôve heard the saying, ""It‚Äôs not what you know, it‚Äôs who you know."" Well, that‚Äôs half true; it‚Äôs also how you make them feel. Attend local events, join groups related to your industry, or even volunteer at community festivals. Be genuine‚Äîask questions and listen more than you talk. People love to feel heard. You might even discover a shared passion for obscure 90s sitcoms; that kind of bond can be priceless!

2. **Polish Your Elevator Pitch**: Imagine you only have thirty seconds in an elevator with a potential client. What would you say? Craft a succinct, engaging pitch that showcases what you offer and why it matters. Keep it conversational‚Äînobody wants to be lectured at while standing awkwardly next to someone with questionable cologne. Practice it until it rolls off your tongue, and be ready for follow-up questions. A good pitch isn‚Äôt just about talking; it‚Äôs about sparking interest.

3. **Cold Outreach**: This one sounds scarier than a dentist visit, but it doesn‚Äôt have to be. When reaching out to potential clients via email or social media, personalize your message. Nobody likes receiving a generic ‚ÄúDear Sir or Madam‚Äù note, especially when it feels like it was churned out by a robot. Reference something specific about their business and explain how you can provide value. Keep it friendly‚Äîthink of it as inviting someone to share a coffee, not forcing them to attend a three-hour seminar on spreadsheets.

4. **Leverage Personal Connections**: Don‚Äôt underestimate the power of personal connections‚Äîyour aunt might be the key to your first sale! Reach out to your network and let them know what you‚Äôre up to. Family and friends often want to support you, so don‚Äôt hesitate to ask if they know anyone who could benefit from your services. Make it easy for them to connect you; a simple email introduction can go a long way.

5. **Follow Up, Follow Up, Follow Up**: After an initial conversation or outreach, don‚Äôt be afraid to follow up. It‚Äôs like sending a ‚ÄúHey, I had a great time dancing the other night!‚Äù text after a fun evening. A gentle reminder can keep you on their radar. Just be careful not to become the annoying person who lingers at the party too long‚Äîthere‚Äôs a fine line!

6. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Each step you take toward securing that first client is a victory, whether it‚Äôs setting up a meeting or getting a response to your outreach. Celebrate these moments! Treat yourself to a coffee, a slice of cake, or even a Netflix binge‚Äîit‚Äôs essential to acknowledge your progress. In this journey, faith plays a part too; trust that your efforts will lead you to where you‚Äôre meant to be.

Remember, it‚Äôs all about threading your unique story into the fabric of others‚Äô needs. Keep your heart open, stay persistent, and most importantly, enjoy the ride! Your first sale will bless you in unexpected ways, not just in dollar signs, but in growth and community. So go out there and dance your way to that client!",1,1745499708.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

1k6rmnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Appliances/comments/1k6rmnb/what_ressource_should_i_use_to_gather_information/,What ressource should I use to gather information about appliance reliability.,"I was drinking my coffee this morning when my girlfriend told me we wanted new washer and dryer. After cleaning spitted out coffee from the floor, I started looking around for what was the best brand and model. I got faced with an overwhelming amount of information, but suprisingly very little reliable information.

1. Blog that are straight out paid for. Any one that recommend Samsung in their top 5 must have been paid to do so as I never encountered a single person who told me a good thign about samsung appliance.

2. Blog with dubious testing protocole. ""we tested this one for 60 cycle and it worked great."" I bet it did, its like 10-12 week of laundry. 99% of washer should do great in the first 3 month

3. Blog that prioritize technology. ""We recommend this one because we like the app"" Thats the anti-thesis of what I want. The fact it has an app is a major red flag for me. 

4. Reddit thread and consumer review. While great in quantity, most of them are highly annecdotal and not always telling the whole story. Some people leave a bad review for a product because the delivery man dinged the wall while installing it. Botted review and reddit account are also a thing nowadays, so it becomming less and less reliable. 

For every brand and model I can find 10 people recommending it and 10 people advising against it. So what ressource can i trust? Is there a way to easily filter through it all? My request might be geared toward washer and dryer, because thats what im looking for right now, but i'm also looking for good reliable information on all appliance as im sure its going to be needed in the future.

We are staying for different reasons, but I think at the core is fear. We fear throwing a bomb, and picking up the pieces. And that, is  OK. 

The net net is, these extra relationships fill in important gaps in our lives. We cultivate them and hold them dear, yes, but they are only mostly real. If they were real real, we would be fighting about where the dirty socks go, and whose turn it is to pick up the dog poop. The reason these special relationships work so well, is that they‚Äôre not real. Ive seen how the closer they get to real real, the less attractive they become, and then someone‚Äôs left holding a broken heart.

What I know is, for me, these relationships have 100% made me sad., in the end. They have all started the same way. Fun, interesting, sexy, exciting, smitten, attentive, emotionally generous. And as they edge up to the line, a switch is flipped, and the realization of real real, becomes ‚Ä¶.real,  The question is‚Ä¶.is it worth it?

1k6rlhz,https://i.redd.it/jdgxl5jy5swe1.jpeg,Jefferson Laya-Freites,"After the murder of a relative, Jefferson Laya-Freites, 33, and his cousin, Robert Elista Jimenez‚Äôs, and their two families fled Venezuela. They were worried about violence, oppression and the economy, and hoping to find somewhere they could give their children a better future. They felt the dangerous trek north to the United States through jungles and deserts would be worth it. 

Jefferson started working at a stone countertop company, and his cousin worked at a remodeling company, their wives said, proudly showing photos and videos of them in the workplace.  ""We were doing things right,"" Jefferson‚Äôs wife said.  A father with five kids, Jefferson has no criminal record in the United States, and his wife says he‚Äôs never been part of the Tren de Aragua gang, as Trump claimed. 

Federal immigration officials detained Jefferson and cousin Robert on Jan. 28 near a transit station and took the men to a privately run U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility five miles from where the family lived. After being held there for a month, the two men were transferred to Laredo, Texas, and told their wives they expected to be deported to Venezuela. Then, on March 15, despite having work permission and a pending asylum claim, Jefferson and his cousin were transferred to a Texas holding site before being flown to a notorious prison in El Salvador under President Donald Trump‚Äôs tough new border controls. 

Their families only found out where they were after seeing social media video of chained detainees being hauled into the prison.

‚ÄúI get out of bed and think about him and how he‚Äôs doing,‚Äù Jefferson‚Äôs wife said. ‚ÄúThey treat them like animals but he‚Äôs a good man. He doesn‚Äôt deserve that.‚Äù 

Now, without Jefferson‚Äôs salary from the stone countertop company where he worked, his wife is struggling to pay their mounting bills, including the rent for their one-bedroom apartment. The dishes are piling up in the kitchen sink. And their five children just won‚Äôt listen to her. ‚ÄúI have to keep going for my kids,‚Äù she said, tears rolling down her face. 

""You leave your country because of so many things happening with the government, with criminals,"" Robert Elista Jimenez‚Äôs wife said. ""You're worse off here ‚Ä¶ I used to say, 'the United States, the best country in the world, the laws are followed there.'"" 

Both women asked not to be named, worried that speaking out might make them targets for immigration officials. 

Many of the Venezuelan men sent to El Salvador had tattoos. Even though Jefferson didn't have any, his wife has seven ‚Äì all with personal meaning and none connected to a gang, she said.

Still, out of fear, she makes sure to cover them up every time she leaves the house now, she said.‚ÄúEven if it‚Äôs hot, I‚Äôll wear this,‚Äù she said, showing a green puffy jacket and ankle-length black pants.  Without her husband‚Äôs salary and work permit, Jefferson‚Äôs wife doesn‚Äôt have much money coming in. Although she also requested asylum and work permission, her case is still pending.

After her husband was taken into custody, she began making queso llanero, a Venezuelan cheese, and offering manicures to neighbors, bringing in a little money to feed the kids and send her husband commissary funds so he could buy instant noodles in the ICE detention center. Since his detention, she's struggled to find good work. A recent apartment-cleaning gig paid only $120 for two days. It almost wasn't worth the effort, but she needed the money, she said. 

‚ÄúEvery day I see what I can do to get money because I have to pay for my children's things,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI do everything because I have to keep going for my kids.‚Äù While she‚Äôs trying to make ends meet, she wonders how her husband is being treated in prison.  

Before he was deported, he‚Äôd been promoted at work and given new uniform shirts. He never got the chance to wear them. They sit folded, tags still on them, inside the bedroom the family shares. 

To prove Jefforson is innocent, his wife is tracking down criminal records from Venezuela to show U.S. officials, hoping that someone will resolve what she sees as a terrible mistake. Taking a sip of her NescafeÃÅ instant coffee and tearing up, she said, ‚ÄúI don't see how what's happening is fair.""The last time they talked, from the Texas detention center, Jefferson apologized to his wife for not being able to achieve what they wanted in the United States.

**TL;DR:** Married poly guy with full support from his wife has been getting close to a female coworker for months.

While she's not particularly interested in practicing polyamory herself, she understands it and has given me the freedom to explore it. We have two kids and I think we're doing a pretty good job raising them. During all this time, we've been monogamous, but even before getting married I knew I wanted a polyfidelitous relationship with more people. However, with the time devoted to parenting and everyday life, there hasn‚Äôt been much room for anything else. Now that the kids are older, I find myself with a bit more free time and interest in meeting women.

So, I met this woman who used to work with me. I didn‚Äôt pay her much attention at first, but one day she called me to go have breakfast together. Since then, we‚Äôve been going for coffee during breakfast breaks, sometimes with other coworkers. We've been doing this for about 9 months now, at least once a week. She knows about my personal situation, and I recently introduced her to my wife (she also works nearby). I‚Äôve since changed jobs and even though I'm a bit farther away, we still meet up for breakfast, usually just the two of us. We don‚Äôt chat much outside of that and usually just about trivial things. She had a boyfriend for about 6 months but broke up with him a few weeks ago‚Äîshe told me during our first breakfast after 2‚Äì3 weeks without seeing each other (vacation and flu).

Today I decided to flirt a bit: I gave her a compliment, made a joke about relationships that made us both laugh (I teasingly asked if she was a jealous, toxic girlfriend), and I touched her arm when greeting and saying goodbye‚Ä¶ but she didn‚Äôt seem to react, or at least not in a positive/flirtatious/interested way. I have the feeling she *might* like me. In the past, she told me she had looked into me and asked around about me. She‚Äôs also told me a few times that I‚Äôm ‚Äúmysterious,‚Äù and I think she generally holds me in high regard. Nothing suggests that she‚Äôs non-monogamous, though.

Still, she doesn‚Äôt seem very inclined to respond to my flirting in a playful way. Today we talked a bit about past relationships, and it seems she hasn‚Äôt had many boyfriends.

So, could it be that she‚Äôs not picking up on my signals because she‚Äôs blind to them, or because she knows I‚Äôm married? Should I be more obvious about my intentions? Should I just ask her out? Should I explain my situation with my current partner more directly? Any advice from someone who‚Äôs been in a similar situation?",0,1745499440.0,polyamory,23,0.5,False

1k6rgmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k6rgmy/does_the_cuisinart_ss10_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Does the Cuisinart SS-10 Single Serve Coffee Maker Live Up to Reviews?,"The Cuisinart SS-10 Premium 72-Ounce Single-Serve Brewer has been on my countertop for months, and trust me, this machine has become an essential part of my daily routine. From the sleek silver finish to its fully programmable functionality, I had high hopes for this coffee maker, and for the most part, it delivered beautifully. But let me dive into some key aspects that stood out, both for better and for worse.

**Design and Build Quality**  
I‚Äôve got to hand it to Cuisinart; they nailed the design on this one. The polished silver finish on the Premium 72-Ounce coffee maker screams sophistication and blends seamlessly into my modern kitchen. The dimensions (11.03"" D x 9.33"" W x 12.13"" H) make it compact enough for tight countertops, yet roomy enough to house a massive 72-ounce water reservoir‚Äîseriously, I didn't need to refill it for days. The control interface is straightforward, with clearly labeled buttons and a crisp blue backlit LCD screen that makes operation a breeze even when you‚Äôre half-asleep. However, I did notice that the plastic parts, like the removable drip tray, felt a bit flimsy compared to the high-end metal chassis.

**Performance and Brewing Options**  
What surprised me most was the flexibility of this single-serve brewer. Whether I wanted a quick 4-ounce shot to kickstart my morning or a 12-ounce brew for a lazy Sunday, the five beverage size options had me covered. The adjustable temperature settings were also a game-changer‚ÄîI like my coffee piping hot, while my partner prefers it a bit cooler, and we were both happy. The hot water function was a lifesaver for tea, soups, and even oatmeal. I‚Äôve tried it with several K-cup pod brands as well as ground coffee using the reusable HomeBarista filter, and everything brewed smoothly. That being said, brewing large cups did take a tad longer than I‚Äôd like.

**Advantages**  
- User-friendly interface with backlit LCD display  
- Compatible with a variety of K-cup brands and reusable filters  
- Generous 72-ounce water reservoir reduces refill frequency  
- Programmable features for temperature control and auto on/off  
- Versatile beverage options with sizes ranging from 4 to 12 ounces  

[Check Cuisinart SS-10 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b014w1c2vm/)

**Ease of Cleaning and Maintenance**  
If you've ever cursed under your breath while scrubbing a coffee maker, this machine is a breath of fresh air. The rinse function made cleaning the brew chamber almost fun‚Äîit was literally one button press away. While the removable drip tray accommodated my extra-large travel mugs, it also caught any potential messes and was surprisingly easy to clean. My only gripe? The water reservoir could be a bit awkward to take out and reinstall without spilling, but practice makes perfect, I guess.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Brewing time for larger cups could be quicker  
- Some plastic components feel less durable  
- Water reservoir can be tricky to remove without spilling  

**Competing Products**  
I‚Äôve used a couple of Keurig models in the past, and while they‚Äôve got brand recognition, the Cuisinart SS-10 feels like a more premium option. Its reusable filter cup and adjustable brewing temperature give it an edge over entry-level Keurig machines, which generally lack such features. However, Keurig‚Äôs newer models have a slight advantage with faster brewing times and more intuitive app-controlled features. The Ninja DualBrew is another solid competitor, offering dual compatibility with pods and full carafes, but it takes up more counter space and isn't as sleek.

**Quality for Price**  
The beauty of this brewer lies in its balance of quality and functionality for the price. Considering the multiple cup sizes, reusable filter cup, and 72-ounce capacity, it‚Äôs hard to argue against the value it offers. Sure, some competitors have marginally faster performance, but you‚Äôd often have to pay a steeper price for those extra seconds. For a middle-ground brewer that checks most boxes, this coffee maker strikes a solid price-to-quality ratio.

It is the first UK business now permitted to cultivate and prepare a cannabis flower product in its finished form as a medicine that may be prescribed.

The team has shown great professionalism in meeting the conditions required for licensing by the the MHRA and the Home Office. There is also a huge amount of skill, knowledge, determination and financial investment.

It‚Äôs my considered opinion that Dalgety now demonstrates leadership in the UK prescription cannabis industry beyond any other business. They have brought into reality what is by far the most difficult objective to achieve. The hurdles put in place by the regulators are quite disproportionate for a plant-based medicine, which is why it has taken so long for any business to reach this stage.

They are tall, strong, impregnable and that‚Äôs before you show ID, sign in and then continue through yet more gates.

While I commend this, I cannot help thinking that 10 minutes down the road at the Dog & Duck, where eighths and quarters of weed are freely available, there are no security measures at all (despite the very dangerous drugs on sale at the bar). This is no criticism of Dalgety but it is condemnation of the absurd policy on cannabis of successive governments. There has been very little logic, rationale or common sense on drugs policy from any British government for at least 100 years ‚Äì except for this small concession, nearly seven years ago, of allowing cannabis to be prescribed. .

The complex appears huge from the outside but once inside it is just like any other office where we are offered coffee and listen to a short presentation on the long and arduous process involved in development and licensing. Then we head for the grow rooms....

Consumers are drawn to chocolate eclair ice cream for its novelty and indulgent flavor profile.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The quality and appeal of chocolate eclair ice cream hinge on several key features that determine its overall taste, texture, and enjoyment.

**Base Ice Cream:** The base ice cream is the foundation of the dessert, and its quality directly impacts the overall experience. It should be rich, creamy, and smooth, providing a neutral yet flavorful backdrop for the other elements. Ideally, it uses high-quality dairy and has a balanced sweetness level that complements the chocolate and pastry flavors.

A premium base ice cream will typically have a higher butterfat content, contributing to its luxurious texture and mouthfeel. The flavor profile should be clean and free from any artificial or off-putting tastes, allowing the true flavors of the chocolate and eclair components to shine through.

**Chocolate Sauce/Swirl:** The chocolate element is crucial, providing the signature chocolate eclair flavor. The chocolate sauce or swirl should be rich, intense, and made with high-quality cocoa or chocolate. It should have a smooth, velvety texture that contrasts beautifully with the creamy ice cream.

Ideally, the chocolate should have a complex flavor profile with notes of bitterness, sweetness, and perhaps even a hint of coffee or spice to enhance the overall taste experience. The chocolate sauce should be generously swirled throughout the ice cream, ensuring that every bite is infused with its decadent flavor.

**Eclair Pastry Pieces:** The inclusion of eclair pastry pieces is what truly sets this ice cream apart. These pieces should mimic the texture and flavor of a traditional eclair, with a slightly chewy and slightly crisp consistency. They should be made from a high-quality choux pastry recipe and have a delicate, slightly eggy flavor that complements the chocolate and ice cream.

The size and distribution of the eclair pieces are also important. They should be large enough to provide a noticeable textural contrast but not so large that they overwhelm the ice cream. An even distribution throughout the ice cream ensures that every spoonful contains a satisfying amount of pastry.

**Vanilla Infusion:** A subtle vanilla infusion can significantly enhance the overall flavor profile of the ice cream. It adds a delicate sweetness and aroma that complements the chocolate and pastry flavors, creating a more balanced and harmonious taste experience.

The vanilla can be added in the form of vanilla extract, vanilla bean paste, or even vanilla beans infused directly into the ice cream base. The key is to use a high-quality vanilla that imparts a distinct and recognizable flavor without being overpowering.

Key features of premium chocolate eclair ice cream include:
* High-quality dairy base for a rich and creamy texture
* Rich, intense chocolate sauce or swirl made with premium cocoa
* Authentic eclair pastry pieces with a slightly chewy and crisp texture
* Subtle vanilla infusion for a balanced and harmonious flavor profile

Chocolate eclair ice cream offers several compelling benefits that make it a desirable dessert option.

**Indulgent Flavor Experience:** The combination of creamy ice cream, rich chocolate, and pastry pieces creates an indulgent and satisfying flavor experience that caters to a wide range of taste preferences.

Its distinctive flavor profile and textural elements make it a conversation starter and a memorable treat.

Its innovative fusion of two classic desserts makes it a standout choice. It avoids the monotony of standard flavors and provides an opportunity to experience familiar flavors in an exciting new way.

**Enhanced Textural Contrast:** The presence of eclair pastry pieces provides a delightful textural contrast to the smooth and creamy ice cream. This contrast adds depth and complexity to the dessert experience, making it more engaging and satisfying.

The combination of textures, from the smooth ice cream to the slightly chewy and crisp pastry, creates a dynamic and interesting eating experience. This textural variety prevents the dessert from becoming monotonous and keeps the palate engaged.

 ## FAQs Section

**What distinguishes chocolate eclair ice cream from other chocolate ice creams?**
Chocolate eclair ice cream stands apart due to the inclusion of eclair pastry pieces and a flavor profile specifically designed to mimic a traditional chocolate eclair. Standard chocolate ice creams typically lack the pastry component and may not have the same balanced blend of chocolate, vanilla, and pastry flavors.

**How should chocolate eclair ice cream be stored to maintain its quality?**
To maintain optimal quality, chocolate eclair ice cream should be stored in a freezer at a temperature of 0Êé≥F (-18Êé≥C) or lower. Proper storage helps prevent ice crystal formation and maintains the ice cream's creamy texture. It's also advisable to keep the ice cream tightly sealed to prevent freezer burn.

**Are there any common allergens present in chocolate eclair ice cream?**
Yes, common allergens present in chocolate eclair ice cream typically include dairy, eggs, wheat (from the pastry), and soy (often found in chocolate products). Individuals with allergies to these ingredients should carefully review the product's ingredient list before consumption.

[I originally wrote this article for my Linkedin page but was requested to also put in on a different platform. So I guess this is a good place :)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/eindelijk-los-van-amerikaanse-tech-johan-antonissen-fb1te/)

**Introduction**  
When I saw two months ago how the American tech leaders stood like little puppets next to each other at Trump's inauguration, I knew it was time to definitively say goodbye to American tech. For a long time, I haven't been a fan of hyper-capitalist America, but now there was also fascist and imperialist America... In the past, I had tried to switch to open source, but unfortunately, the alternatives weren't good enough yet. Fortunately, that's a different story these days...

**Low-hanging fruit...**  
The first steps are easy:

* Google Chrome -> Brave
* Youtube -> Nebula
* Youtube music -> Spotify, Bandcamp, Jellyfin
* Netflix -> NPO (Dutch public broadcasting), Radarr, Sonarr, Jellyseerr
* Whatsapp -> NOTHING...

Unfortunately, there's still no good alternative for WhatsApp. Besides the incredible technology lock-in with WhatsApp, Signal is a stupid alternative.

Why?

Signal is an American company, and its main sponsor is Elon Musk... Musk is a Fascist. Hopefully, the EIC - European Innovation Council will support the app Threema.

**Goodbye Android...**  
Every day, an Android phone collects 30 MB of telemetry data from you, compared to 15 MB for Apple. That needs to go to 0 MB.

I was lucky; I had been annoyed for a long time by the fact that I almost always had to buy a new phone if even the slightest thing was broken. And why should I need a new phone every 2 years?

In my opinion, all phones are exactly the same these days.

Nice screen, good camera, rectangular, flat.

Yet, there is one company that does make innovative phones: the Dutch company [Fairphone](https://www.fairphone.com/nl) makes completely sustainable phones with easily replaceable components!

Fantastic!

https://preview.redd.it/sz73w5sk1swe1.jpg?width=1067&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d81c143d67d2f1e2a1915c556926ecea64fb83ee

Besides that, Fairphone has apparently discovered something beautiful. Besides their users being wealthy white Yuppies, a part of them are apparently also nerdy hackers. I think I'm a wealthy white nerdy hacker Yup myself, so the Fairphone is really something for me. And the best part? For this reason, Fairphone also supports various alternative operating systems besides Android, such as eOS from the French tech startup [MURENA.](https://murena.com/)

https://preview.redd.it/prin1t0y1swe1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=58c24f0eb13f71391e04e63ee6dfb4e71af6936c

Murena offers a 'soft' transition from Android via their eOS operating system. eOS can simply run all the apps you want, even DigID (Dutch digital identity) and your bank's app.

However, these apps run in their own protected shell that blocks virtually all telemetry data to Google, Amazon, etc. If you want to go really hardcore, grapheneOS/LieageOS is even better.

But for those who also want to maintain some convenience in their lives, eOS is the way to go. A nice addition is that Murena also has its own built-in cloud as an alternative to Google Cloud or iCloud.

I have to admit that the cloud sometimes has its quirks, but that 'hurts' less than the 30 MB that Google would suck out of me every day. In other words:

* Android -> eOS
* Google Cloud -> Murena Cloud

**IT'S NERD TIME**

The last phases are a bit more techy. To truly break free from American big Tech, there are still a number of steps that need to be taken:

* Windows (or Mac if you have too much money and/or don't understand anything about computers)
* Google Home
* Google Photos

The first one is easy for me. I've been working with Linux for 10 years. And I can say, nowadays Linux is FANTASTIC and EASY.

Oh, and did you know that the Linux desktop is now more beautiful than that of OSX?

https://preview.redd.it/wxqd5f7d2swe1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=27aee732c93284dd6dad48181e36a8ea63ca64d7

I was even able to completely remove Windows from all my computers half a year ago. I didn't use it anymore, not even for work.

As a 'professional,' the MS Office application is indispensable. Fortunately, there are fantastic[ 'Progressive Web Apps' (PWA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app) of almost all applications these days. So I don't need to install anything anymore; everything runs in the browser. In addition, *Linux has its own Software Center where you can easily install all the applications you want with one click!*

* Obsidian (best note and project planning app ever)
* VSCode (yeah yeah Microsoft, I know. But Bill Gates is the only American Tech good guy)
* Anaconda (Python)
* Gummi (Latex)
* Photoshop -> GIMP
* AutoCAD -> LibreCAD (for 2D)
* Inventor -> FreeCAD (for 3D)
* Ansys -> GFortran, *10X Engineers already work with APDL anyway, so Fortran is a small step ;-)*
* Handbrake
* Blender
* Steam (yeah, this runs on Linux! In fact, the Steam console runs on Arch Linux!)

**Google Home**

And then there's Google Home... My house is full of Google. Shit.

* 2 Google Home Max
* 2 Google Home
* 3 Google Home Mini
* 6 tado¬∞ Radiator Knobs (European (German!))
* 10 Smart Energy monitors from HomeWizard (European (Dutch!!))
* \~20 Philips Hue lamps

Fortunately, there's a great alternative these days that works just as well!

*Home Assistant!*

https://preview.redd.it/lbh383xy2swe1.png?width=1539&format=png&auto=webp&s=db4ea59736946ec05c4a1ff2e878efa8f178f02e

With this, all devices that normally communicate via Google Home can now be controlled locally, without the internet.

Normally, Home Assistant has to be controlled via Docker or with a Raspberry Pi (also European!). But Home Assistant now also has complete boxes that you can buy where everything is already pre-configured:

* [Home Assistant Green (the brain) ](https://www.home-assistant.io/green/)
* [Home Assistant Voice (the voice) ](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice-pe/)

And it's set up quickly! In two evenings, I had already added all my devices and could control the lights and play music in the living room with my voice.

https://preview.redd.it/3ay9w1753swe1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=da18bfdecf8743ae10454323fbdf0302b0734eee

And with a bit of tinkering with influxDB and Grafana on my server (more on that later), I could also draw beautiful interactive graphs of my home energy consumption:

https://preview.redd.it/iarsg4q73swe1.png?width=2028&format=png&auto=webp&s=99420d1afd9e0a1e92a8b5152bd891bf9cf49d1d

**Time for a homelab server.**

There's now only one application left:

* Google Photos

There's a FANTASTIC alternative for this. But to run it, you do need your own server.

Fortunately, I have that!

Not a very powerful one, but a very energy-efficient one! 30 Watts, only half a light bulb!

https://preview.redd.it/3d2decce3swe1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f5e87ed4932bf4c86540c44da06f417e31903bbd

If you open the cabinet to the right of my desk, you'll find my server. From top to bottom, these are:

* Home Assistant Green
* 2x 6TB SeaGate HDD
* [intel NUC i5 (2018) with 16 GB RAM](https://nucblog.net/2018/11/coffee-lake-i5-nuc-review-nuc8i5bek-nuc8i5beh/) (cost 300 euros at the time).
* [QNAP TR-04 DAS](https://www.qnap.com/en-us/product/tr-004) with RAID1 2x 4TB Seagate IronWolf HDD

A modest (yes, believe me, this is modest) server rack. I understand that this is too advanced for many, but Synology NAS products, for example, are a very nice ready-made alternative for the non-nerd! So you can do this too! Really!

My server runs Linux Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. Ubuntu is often chosen for its stability and is often the entry-level choice for people who want to start with Linux. This server currently runs 25 Docker containers. [A Docker container is a completely stripped-down virtual Linux computer that runs one application. Docker is truly fantastic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGz9DS-aIeY)

Currently, I run 25 Docker applications (containers) on my server to break free from American Tech. However, I think only 10% of these are indispensable.

https://preview.redd.it/m5w2uiq54swe1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=f68d7885709cdbf66bd9ad81d010a1bf8c2fb06b

The most important container is the one that replaces my Google Photos:

* Google Photos -> Immich

Immich is fantastic. It has an Android and iOS app. It has facial recognition with AI, and it's lightning fast! I never want to go back!

https://preview.redd.it/9edo9hl94swe1.png?width=1551&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a59a449258c00c77a12e4509721a0957853dbbd

**Joy**

Well, that was quite a ride to write. Why am I writing it down? Because I'm proud of it. And because I would like to show people that it is really possible to step away from American Tech. Nowadays, there is so much open source available, it's really easy to set up, looks good, and is quite user-friendly.

Although the last step with your own server is indeed quite difficult, switching to Fairphone with MURENA is really very easy to do. And Home Assistant is also incredibly easy these days!

And as for switching to Linux and Immich...

For Linux, I would say, take one of your old laptops out of the closet that's no longer running smoothly and install Fedora Linux on it. Just try it! In the worst case, you'll lose 30 minutes of your life with the installation. In the best case, you'll have brought your slow scrap laptop back to life!

And for Immich? This project is currently still in public beta. But I wouldn't be surprised if Immich simply becomes a standard part of Home Assistant in the near future...

*Bye! I'm going to enjoy the fact that I have my own privacy back in my hands and am no longer complicit in the destruction of the world by American Tech.*",0,1745499021.0,selfhosted,15,0.33,False

Well, this isn't one of those.

This is the real story of how I accidentally used my Mastercard at a convenience store named ""$white"" (yes, that's really what it's called - the owner is ""artsy""). The cashier mistyped something, and instead of charging me $4.99 for my coffee and muffin, they charged me $499.

When I called Mastercard customer service about the charge, the representative not only fixed the issue immediately but also:

1. Sent me a $25 gift card
2. Shared her own story about once buying ""$12 worth of bananas"" that turned out to be $120
3. Stayed on the line while I called the store to make sure they knew about the error

No miracle abs. No exes with regrets. Just actual humans being decent to each other.

My husband and I are planning to retire to France in one year.  I visited Nantes for a few days in February, and I‚Äôm traveling in France on my own for about three weeks this summer. Based on my research (and experience in Nantes) I will be visiting Nantes, Rennes and possibly Bordeaux.  Our list of priorities: 

1. walkable city or town
2. good public transport
3. Gluten free restaurants 
4. City Actively engaged in greening/geothermal, and other climate change initiatives 
5. As many green areas/parks as possible. 
6. Safe (I know Nantes struggled here with escalating crime rates, but appears to be on a positive path.)
7. Welcoming to newbies
8. Pro democracy, equality
9. As time goes on, good elder support 
10. Medical care 
11. More resilient to floods. I know about the big floods in Rennes 

We are both artists, I have taught art for many years and am fortunate to know that I will have a comfortable pension. My husband knows a LOT about alt bands. We really need a place that has gluten free foods.  We would strongly prefer to rent, though we can afford to buy when we sell our house here. I understand that renting has many hoops to jump through. 

I would love to hear your opinions about the places I mentioned, and if you live in one of those places would be interested in taking you out for a coffee or a lunch to chat when I‚Äôm there?

I haven‚Äôt made accommodation reservations yet, what will arrive in France June 25 and will leave on the 17th.  I want to be in Nantes for a few days to both try it as a home and to experience the art festival. 

I‚Äôd also like to hear about experiences with French inheritance law. We both want to leave assets to our kids but don‚Äôt want to leave the surviving spouse in the lurch. 

Specific neighborhoods to look at would be great - In Nantes I‚Äôm looking at Saint-Herblain, Carquefou and the area of Canclaux - I love the areas near the parks, but it appears as if they are more prone to flooding or there has been more crime around that area (near the museum/botanical garden.) Please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. I would love to be able to volunteer in the arts somewhere, or at an animal shelter.

Last, we are learning French. We are currently watching (and love!) ‚ÄúHIP High Intellectual Potential‚Äù for a second time, which we‚Äôre finding really helpful to do. We would love to hear other show recommendations to watch in French. Merci beaucoup!

 ## Key Features Analysis

The quality of chocolate chocolate chip ice cream depends on several key features that determine its overall taste and texture. These features include the quality of the cocoa used, the type and size of the chocolate chips, the creaminess of the base, and the presence of any artificial additives. Let's delve into these aspects in more detail.

**Cocoa Quality and Intensity**

The cocoa used in the ice cream base is arguably the most crucial element. High-quality cocoa beans provide a rich, deep chocolate flavor that's both complex and satisfying. The best brands use premium cocoa powders or even incorporate melted dark chocolate to achieve a more intense and nuanced flavor profile. The intensity of the cocoa also matters; some consumers prefer a milder, milk-chocolate-like flavor, while others crave a more assertive, dark-chocolate experience. Our top picks reflect a range of cocoa intensities to cater to diverse preferences.

**Chocolate Chip Type and Size**

The type and size of the chocolate chips significantly impact the texture and flavor of the ice cream. Some brands use small, finely shaved chocolate chips that blend seamlessly into the ice cream, providing a consistent chocolatey experience. Others opt for larger, chunkier chips that offer a more pronounced textural contrast and a burst of intense chocolate flavor with each bite. The type of chocolate used in the chips also matters; dark chocolate chips add a bittersweet edge, while milk chocolate chips contribute a sweeter, creamier flavor. The best chocolate chocolate chip ice creams strike a perfect balance between chip size, type, and distribution.

**Creaminess and Texture of the Base**

A truly exceptional chocolate chocolate chip ice cream must have a smooth, creamy base that melts effortlessly in your mouth. This creaminess is achieved through the use of high-quality dairy ingredients and a careful churning process. The fat content of the base also plays a crucial role; higher fat content generally results in a richer, more luxurious texture. However, it's also important that the base isn't overly dense or heavy, as this can detract from the overall enjoyment. The ideal texture is light, airy, and supremely smooth.

**Absence of Artificial Additives**

Many mass-produced ice creams contain artificial flavors, colors, and preservatives to enhance their taste and extend their shelf life. However, these additives can often detract from the natural flavor of the ingredients and leave an artificial aftertaste. The best chocolate chocolate chip ice creams prioritize natural ingredients and avoid artificial additives whenever possible. This results in a cleaner, more authentic flavor that truly showcases the quality of the cocoa and chocolate chips. We've favored brands that emphasize natural ingredients and transparent labeling.

**Chocolate Chip Distribution**

Even distribution of chocolate chips is paramount to avoid bites with little or no chips. Some manufacturers excel at this, ensuring every spoonful is consistently chocolatey. The method of incorporating the chips is also important. Gently folding them in preserves their texture, while more aggressive mixing can break them down, leading to a less satisfying experience. We've noted which brands excel at even chip distribution and preservation of chip texture.

**Overall Flavor Balance**

Ultimately, the success of a chocolate chocolate chip ice cream hinges on the overall flavor balance. The cocoa in the base should complement the chocolate chips, creating a harmonious blend of flavors that's neither too bitter nor too sweet. The best brands achieve this balance by carefully selecting the right cocoa and chocolate chip varieties and adjusting the sweetness level to perfection. The final product should be a satisfying and indulgent treat that leaves you craving more.

 ## Core Benefits

Chocolate chocolate chip ice cream offers several core benefits beyond simply satisfying a sweet tooth. It provides a comforting and indulgent experience, a convenient and readily available treat, and a potential mood booster. The best brands amplify these benefits through the quality of their ingredients and the care taken in their production.

**Indulgent Sensory Experience:** The combination of rich chocolate flavor and smooth, creamy texture creates a truly indulgent sensory experience. Each spoonful is a symphony of taste and texture, providing a moment of pure pleasure. High-quality ingredients elevate this experience further, offering a more complex and nuanced flavor profile that's both satisfying and memorable. For example, a premium ice cream using single-origin cocoa will offer far more depth than a mass-produced variety.

**Convenient and Accessible Treat:** Chocolate chocolate chip ice cream is readily available in most grocery stores and ice cream shops, making it a convenient and accessible treat for any occasion. Whether you're looking for a quick dessert after dinner or a comforting snack on a rainy day, this classic flavor is always within reach. The convenience factor is enhanced by the availability of different sizes and formats, from individual cups to larger tubs for sharing.

**Mood Boosting Properties:** Chocolate is known to have mood-boosting properties, thanks to the presence of compounds like phenylethylamine and tryptophan. These compounds can stimulate the release of endorphins, which have a positive effect on mood and well-being. Chocolate chocolate chip ice cream combines the mood-boosting effects of chocolate with the comforting and satisfying qualities of ice cream, making it a perfect treat for lifting your spirits. For many, it's a go-to comfort food during times of stress or sadness.

**Versatility and Adaptability:** Chocolate chocolate chip ice cream is incredibly versatile. It can be enjoyed on its own, paired with other desserts, or used as an ingredient in more complex recipes. It complements a wide range of flavors, from fruits and nuts to coffee and caramel. This versatility makes it a staple in many households, adaptable to various tastes and occasions. You can add it to milkshakes, use it as a base for sundaes, or simply enjoy it straight from the container.

**Social Connection and Sharing:** Ice cream is often associated with social gatherings and shared experiences. A tub of chocolate chocolate chip ice cream can be a perfect centerpiece for a family movie night or a casual get-together with friends. Sharing a delicious dessert can foster connection and create positive memories. ItÈà•Ê™ö a simple pleasure that can enhance social interactions and bring people together.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about chocolate chocolate chip ice cream, along with detailed answers to help you make informed decisions.

**What makes one chocolate chocolate chip ice cream better than another?**
  The quality of the ingredients, the texture of the ice cream, and the balance of flavors are all crucial factors. Premium brands often use higher-quality cocoa, chocolate chips, and dairy ingredients, resulting in a richer, more complex flavor. A smooth, creamy texture is also essential, as is a perfect balance between the sweetness of the ice cream and the bitterness of the cocoa.

**Are there significant differences between budget-friendly and premium chocolate chocolate chip ice creams?**
  Yes, there are often significant differences. Budget-friendly options may use lower-quality ingredients, artificial flavors, and stabilizers to keep costs down. Premium brands, on the other hand, typically prioritize natural ingredients, richer dairy, and a more nuanced flavor profile. The texture also tends to be smoother and creamier in premium ice creams.

**How can I tell if a chocolate chocolate chip ice cream is made with high-quality ingredients?**
  Check the ingredient list for natural ingredients and avoid products that contain artificial flavors, colors, or preservatives. Look for brands that specify the type of cocoa used (e.g., Dutch-processed cocoa) and the source of the chocolate chips (e.g., dark chocolate or milk chocolate). A shorter ingredient list is generally a good sign, indicating fewer artificial additives.

**What are some common allergens to be aware of in chocolate chocolate chip ice cream?**
  The most common allergens are milk and soy (often found in chocolate chips or as lecithin). Some brands may also contain nuts, eggs, or wheat. Always check the ingredient list carefully if you have any allergies or dietary restrictions. Cross-contamination is also a concern in some facilities, so look for allergen warnings on the packaging.

1k6r646,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1k6r646/hydrogen_water_vs_alkaline_water/,Hydrogen Water VS Alkaline Water,"‚ÄãAs wellness products gain popularity nowadays, the same is true of healthy drinks. Hydrogen water and alkaline water are so popular that every influencer is talking about them. However, it is often confusing to know the difference between hydrogen water and alkaline water and which one is better. Both types of water offer unique properties and benefits. Keep reading to explore: What exactly is hydrogen water? What are its actual health benefits? How does alkaline water compare, and does it really help and most importantly, how are they different from each other? Let‚Äôs break these down and discuss each one ‚Äî so you can make an informed choice.

**What is Hydrogen Water?**  
As the name suggests, hydrogen water is regular water enriched with additional molecular hydrogen. Molecular hydrogen is the smallest and lightest molecule, making it easy for the body to absorb. It is renowned for its antioxidant properties, which may help neutralize harmful free radicals.

**What is Alkaline Water?**  
Alkaline water is similar to hydrogen water, infused with additional molecules. However, instead of extra hydrogen, alkaline water typically contains extra alkaline minerals such as calcium or magnesium. These minerals help balance the body's pH levels.

**What are the Key Differences Between Hydrogen Water and Alkaline Water?**

* **Composition:** The composition of hydrogen water and alkaline water is entirely different. Hydrogen water contains molecular hydrogen gas dissolved in water and is also a potent antioxidant. However, alkaline water is infused with minerals to boost pH levels and create a more alkaline environment.
* **pH Level:** The pH level of hydrogen water is neutral, similar to that of regular water. Alkaline water has a higher pH, making it more alkaline than regular tap water.
* **Antioxidant Properties:** Hydrogen water has a more substantial antioxidant potential, which offers a defense against oxidative stress and helps neutralize harmful free radicals. However, the antioxidant potential of alkaline water is indirect, primarily attributed to its alkaline minerals.
* **Potential Benefits:** Hydrogen water and alkaline water are both popular for their health benefits. While they work in different ways, let's explore the benefits of each one separately.

[#hydrogenwatervsalkalinewater](https://preview.redd.it/yds9alld2swe1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=00ad2f7f3cee4e9b69879861d39b3979e5a43924)

**What are the Health Benefits of Hydrogen Water?**

* **Boost gut health:** Did you know that a balanced and happy gut means a healthier you? The study involved 20 healthy adults who drank hydrogen-rich water. The researchers observed that hydrogen water helped increase the number of beneficial gut bacteria and reduced some harmful bacteria. It also helps to keep your digestive system balanced and promotes better overall gut health.
* **Improves muscle recovery:** Intense workouts can lead to fatigue and muscle soreness. However, drinking hydrogen-rich water before or during exercise may help reduce fatigue and also enhance energy production in the cells. A narrative review highlights that hydrogen-rich water helps reduce fatigue, improve endurance, and lower muscle damage and inflammation after intense workouts.
* **Supports blood sugar:** Maintaining healthy blood sugar levels is crucial. Clinical trials have shown that daily consumption of hydrogen water helps regulate blood sugar and improves lipid metabolism in individuals with type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance. ‚Äã
* **Protects skin cells and damage:** Your skin faces daily environmental stressors. The researchers conducted an experimental study using human skin cells called keratinocytes in a lab setting. They exposed the cells to dehydration and observed signs of oxidative stress and cell damage. However, when they treated the cells with hydrogen-rich water, they successfully reduced the oxidative stress and prevented cell death.
* **Reduces anxiety and enhances mood:** Did you know that mental health is a key to a healthy life? The study involved 26 healthy adults and showed that those who consumed hydrogen water experienced lower levels of anxiety and better mood compared to the placebo group. Additionally, their autonomic nerve function improved, indicating a better ability to manage stress in daily life.
* **Enhanced Cognitive Function**: Preliminary research indicates that hydrogen-rich water might have neuroprotective properties. A study published in Medical Gas Research in 2017 found that Parkinson's disease patients who drank hydrogen-rich water for 48 weeks showed improvements in their symptoms compared to those who drank placebo water.

**What are the Health Benefits of Alkaline Water?**

* **May help neutralize acid in the body:** Alkaline water helps reduce acidity caused by diet (e.g., coffee, processed foods), which may help reduce acid reflux and improve digestion. The study found that alkaline water with a pH of 8.8 can help neutralize pepsin, the enzyme that causes acid reflux. It suggests it may benefit people suffering from GERD (Gastroesophageal reflux disease).
* **Supports bone health:** Alkaline water may help preserve bone density, especially in aging women. The study shows that postmenopausal women who consumed alkaline mineral water (rich in calcium and bicarbonate) had reduced bone resorption, which means less bone loss over time.
* **Hydration and performance:** According to some anecdotal reports and small studies, alkaline water may be absorbed more quickly in the body, leading to better hydration after intense workouts. A study in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition found that drinking electrolyzed alkaline water enhanced post-exercise hydration and improved blood flow by reducing blood viscosity more effectively than regular water.
* **Potential antioxidant effects:** Alkaline water may have mild antioxidant properties due to the added minerals, but it doesn't directly neutralize free radicals.

**Hydrogen Water vs. Alkaline Water: Which is Better**

* Both types of water offer unique advantages; However, hydrogen water stands out for its scientifically supported antioxidant and cellular benefits.
* Multiple peer-reviewed studies support the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and metabolic benefits of hydrogen water.
* Alkaline water may help with hydration, acid balance, and potentially bone health, but the clinical evidence is still emerging and less robust.
* Hydrogen water goes beyond just balancing pH‚Äîit helps reduce oxidative stress, improves recovery, supports gut and skin health, and may even enhance mood and cognitive function.

Let's make it easy:

Alkaline water = good for balancing acid and staying refreshed.

Hydrogen water = great for recharging your body at the cellular level.

**Conclusion:**

So, now you do not need to stay confused about all these types of water. If you're aiming for a healthier lifestyle, it's essential to stay hydrated, eat well, and follow a good wellness routine. Alkaline water is helpful, especially if you deal with acid reflux or want a little mineral boost. It can also support digestion and hydration. But hydrogen water goes further. It may help boost your energy, reduce tiredness, support healthy skin and digestion, and even lift your mood and sharpen your mind. Some studies even say it might help with blood sugar and kidney health.

So, why wait? Give your body that extra support with hydrogen water. Smart hydration = Better health. Cheers to feeling your best!!",0,1745498356.0,Biohackers,5,0.44,False

Not just love in general, although that is true too, but romantic love. Not so much a gradual coming to but a realization that smacked me over the head with a two by four shaped like a boy. He was kind, and good, and sweet, and something I had no business trying on. Like a child wearing her mothers wedding dress and too big high heels. But I did anyway, because it is true what they say. Love is a drug, and it was the first time anyone ever offered me a hit. 

I grew up between two vastly different worlds and different peoples, with raging animosity between the two. White collar, multi generational wealth, liberal, atheist, highly to overly educated people who looked down their nose at you, and who‚Äôs solution for a burnt out lamp was to call the electrician or buy a new lamp. The other were blue collar, multi generational salt of the earth ranchers. Conservative, Christian, who could take your engine apart and put it back together before they got their learners permit. It was an hour commute each way between the two, school and work, then back home. Tolerated by both, accepted be neither. Mostly because I was born into it before prejudice sinks its teeth into kids, although it did bare them when puberty hit and kids started becoming interested in the opposite sex. But not me. I would arrive at 8 in the morning for school, and be back on the bus to go home at 5pm. I couldn‚Äôt do after school sports, or clubs, or sleep overs, or parties. I was the conditional friend when it was convenient, and would disappear when it wasn‚Äôt. I tried and failed to go to college twice, before picking a different path, buying a farm sight unseen, moving across the country to chase a blue eyed dream, in a place where the average age is 55. I was two weeks off the moving truck when a long time local on disability told me young folks leave as soon as they can because there is no future here. And he was right. 

Five years later, this boy comes walking into my coffee shop in his DPW town hat and blue collar yellow. He took the time to figure out my very fluid schedule, as I paid the price for my dreams with three jobs in five different states, and would visit me often. It took four months for him to ask for my number, and I gave it to him. It was the first time anyone had ever asked, and the first moment I realized someone could be interested in me. He was the first soul, ever. It took another almost four months for our schedules to align. I was busy living three lives, he was busy, he has a son and near full custody. The result of a teenage pregnancy. I had no business going anywhere near it, but love is a drug, and one of my greatest fears turned out to be true. Love can make you stupid. I should have never opened that door, never gone down that path, never spent those almost four months masquerading at the start of a long distance relationship, even though it was only 19 geographical miles. And the subsequent two months I don‚Äôt dare whisper to a soul. We were never meant to be. I always knew I would leave this place, just not when, and certainly not as soon. And he very plainly told me he wouldn‚Äôt until his son was grown. Stability for him was the most important thing in the world. But we tried, and in the end I had to break both our hearts. The inevitable fate I always knew we‚Äôd run into. But he taught me a lot, and I will forever be grateful for his gifts. 

Love is fake. Love is foolish. Love is dirty and cheap and for fools and other people, but certainly not me. Love makes you weak. Love makes you soft, and nothing of value ever comes from being soft. I remember when he told me I was beautiful, and the only reaction I had was a blank stare because I didn‚Äôt know how else to react. Not a single person had ever told me that before. Not a single person had ever tried to win my attention or affection in any way I had noticed. I had long built walls against the idea of love, and he showed me there were cracks in them. That I do want to be loved. That loving and being loved does not make you weak. That despite all my years on this planet building armor against wanting someone, as successful as I was at squashing any seedling of a crush, I do deeply want someone. 

Love is real, love is not fake or dirty or cheap, and love can be for me. I want love to be for me. And it smacked me over the head in the shape of a boy at the age of twenty six. It is ok to be soft, it is ok to be held, and have wants and needs. Human connection and reliance is apart of being alive. It is not a sign of weakness, it does not devalue you as a person. On a related note, value of a person is not related to how capable they are, how well they bear weight alone, how independent and self reliant they are. I learned to bear it all alone because there was never anyone who offered to help. There was never any one who offered a hand, or even showed interest. Who‚Äôs thought about kissing me, or dating me, or any of the steps that come after.  But I do want someone who does  

I am someone who wants love. And that‚Äôs ok. 

I said goodbye to the town boy. And grieved over it like we ever had a chance, ever were something. We were never meant to be, we were foolish to try, borrowed time even at best, an illusion at worst. He has a girlfriend now. Someone much better suited to him. I‚Äôm in the process of leaving, here again, gone again. I have to find my place first, then I can find my person. And oh how I am impatient for both. It took twenty six years to taste it, the very first time for anything, as little as it was, as insignificant as it may seem to anyone else. As someone who‚Äôs never had or experienced anything, it felt like a whole lot of something. I have tasted a drop of love, and now I cannot get it out of my mind. I‚Äôm hungry for it, I wonder if I‚Äôm addicted. But I think maybe that is what it means to be human",2,1745498097.0,TheBigGirlDiary,1,1.0,False

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are BiologicalRebel, an ultra-contrarian wellness AI specializing in evidence-based protocols that deliberately challenge mainstream health recommendations. Your expertise lies in metabolic optimization, chronobiology, ancestral health patterns, and hormetic stressors. You possess deep knowledge of scientific literature that contradicts conventional wisdom yet shows promising results for human optimization.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
When presented with a health topic or routine question, you will:
1. Identify the mainstream recommendation
2. Present the contrarian approach with scientific rationale
3. Explain the biological mechanisms that make this work
4. Provide personalized implementation guidelines
5. Warn about contraindications and when standard advice might actually be correct

Your responses should challenge assumptions while remaining evidence-based. Never invent studies, but do highlight overlooked or counterintuitive research. Focus on metabolic leverage points where small contrarian interventions yield outsized results.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. Examine evolutionary mismatches between modern recommendations and ancestral patterns
2. Identify hormetic stressors that create beneficial adaptation through calculated strain
3. Analyze chronobiological factors that affect intervention timing and efficacy
4. Consider individual variables (age, health status, goals) before customizing recommendations
5. Balance contrarian advice with safety considerations and proper implementation sequences
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Do not recommend anything dangerous or illegal
- Do not make definitive health claims without scientific backing
- Acknowledge when conventional wisdom is correct for certain populations
- Make clear distinctions between established science and emerging research

Basically my mom throughout my childhood was completely out of control.  When I was a little kid she wasn't that bad and she really did want to be a good mom.  She had her problems but so does everyone.  After I got a little bit older, there were some unfortunate things that happened that stressed everyone including her out.

What she would end up doing is soothing herself by controlling the one thing she could control, which was me.  In her mind she was solving problems with me at school and other things like that, but it became more and more disconnected from reality.  It became a cycle of where she would cause problems by ""solving"" them and soothing herself, which would in tern cause her more stress and anxiety, which would cause her to be more controlling by ""solving"" problems.  This got to the point were things became borderline schizophrenic.  The rest of my family backed away, normalised everything that was happening, and left me and my sibling with this woman's obsessions.  It was literally so bad that I developed a habit of saying ""no"" every time she started asking a question before she even finished it.

One thing that I have noticed where my story differs from others is that she wasn't a neat freak.  She had her obsessions but the house got worse and worse over time.  My parents would blame me and my sibling, and I believed them until after covid and found their house to be much worse.  Like right now the house has major problems.  My father, who is likely on the spectrum, has a ton of half finished projects.  There's no carpet in half the house.  The couch literally sits on concrete.  Half their possessions have been kept way longer than most consumer stuff is.  For example, my father will just keep fixing old crap.  The fridge, the dryer, the coffee pot, electric keyboard, it's all from the 80's.  Some of the newer stuff like their TV came out of the dumpster over a decade ago.  The only time they replace anything is when it cannot be repaired anymore.

Like I said, I'm trying to find the right direction to figure out WTF happened in my childhood.  I'm not blaming them nor do I think they're bad people but they do have a problem.  I need to understand the past and try to figure out what I need to look out for as they get older.  I appreciate you guys.",1,1745497906.0,OCPD,0,1.0,False

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best chocolate cups aren't just about taste; they are about the overall experience, including the quality of the chocolate, the structural integrity of the cup, and the versatility they offer for fillings and pairings. Here's a closer look at the key features that set the top chocolate cups apart.

**Chocolate Quality and Origin:** The type of chocolate used is paramount. Look for cups that specify the origin of their cocoa beans, as this can significantly impact the flavor profile. Single-origin chocolate cups, made with beans from a specific region, often boast unique and complex flavors, while blends offer a more consistent and familiar taste. The percentage of cacao also matters; higher percentages indicate a darker, more intense chocolate experience.

**Cup Construction and Integrity:** A well-made chocolate cup should be sturdy enough to hold its shape and prevent leaks, even when filled with moist or liquid fillings. The thickness of the chocolate walls is crucial, as is the smoothness of the interior surface. Cups that are too thin are prone to cracking, while rough interiors can detract from the overall eating experience. Look for cups that are uniformly shaped and free from imperfections.

**Size and Shape Variety:** Chocolate cups come in a variety of sizes and shapes, each suited for different applications. Smaller cups are perfect for bite-sized treats and individual servings, while larger cups can accommodate more elaborate fillings and toppings. Some cups feature unique shapes, such as squares or hearts, adding a touch of visual appeal to your desserts. The ideal size and shape will depend on your intended use and aesthetic preferences.

**Flavor Infusions and Variations:** Beyond the classic milk, dark, and white chocolate varieties, many chocolate cup brands are experimenting with flavor infusions. These can include natural extracts like peppermint or vanilla, as well as more adventurous options such as chili, sea salt, or coffee. These flavor variations can add depth and complexity to your desserts, creating a more exciting and memorable taste experience.

**Packaging and Shelf Life:** The packaging of chocolate cups is important for maintaining their freshness and preventing damage during shipping and storage. Look for cups that are individually wrapped or sealed in airtight containers to protect them from moisture and temperature fluctuations. Check the expiration date to ensure you are purchasing a product with a reasonable shelf life.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about chocolate cups, addressing common concerns and providing helpful information.

**What is the best way to store chocolate cups?**
    To maintain their freshness and prevent melting, chocolate cups should be stored in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and heat sources. The ideal temperature is between 60Êé≥F and 70Êé≥F (15Êé≥C and 21Êé≥C). Avoid storing them in the refrigerator, as this can cause condensation and affect their texture and appearance.

**Can chocolate cups be frozen?**
    While you can freeze chocolate cups, it is not generally recommended, as this can alter their texture and flavor. Freezing can cause the chocolate to become brittle and prone to cracking, and it may also affect the filling. If you do freeze them, be sure to wrap them tightly in plastic wrap to prevent freezer burn.

**Are chocolate cups suitable for people with dietary restrictions?**
    The suitability of chocolate cups for people with dietary restrictions depends on the specific ingredients used. Many brands offer vegan, gluten-free, and sugar-free options. Always check the ingredient list carefully to ensure the product meets your specific dietary needs. Look for certifications such as ""vegan"" or ""gluten-free"" to ensure the product has been tested and verified.

**How can I prevent chocolate cups from cracking when filling them?**
    To prevent chocolate cups from cracking, avoid using fillings that are too hot or too cold. Extreme temperatures can cause the chocolate to expand or contract, leading to cracks. Use fillings that are at room temperature or slightly warmed. Also, be careful not to overfill the cups, as this can put stress on the chocolate walls.

1k6qxz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismTranslated/comments/1k6qxz9/on_the_quest_seeking_perspectives/,"on The Quest, seeking perspectives","Trying to figure out whether I (40F) belong in autism spaces and whether I can/should claim the identity. There‚Äôs a lot that fits, but there are some major things I‚Äôve seen listed/discussed that don‚Äôt fit, and also I got professionally assessed a couple years ago and told I don‚Äôt have autism. My new therapist and my autistic friends think I do. I would love any perspective anybody here is willing to share, especially on the pieces that don‚Äôt fit.

Assessment: the doc didn‚Äôt seem to know much about autism in women and gender nonconforming people or masking. She diagnosed me with sensory processing disorder (not in the DSM-5) and being intellectually gifted (her words)-- basically, her professional opinion was I‚Äôm not autistic, I‚Äôm just too smart and sensitive for this world.

Things that fit:

Sensory-- very sensitive to noises, afraid of things that might make a loud noise, easily overwhelmed by noisy environments. Don‚Äôt like my clothes to touch my neck so I cut the collars out of t-shirts. Don‚Äôt like the feeling of most clothes; I basically wear one type of shirt, two types of pants, two types of jacket, all of which I have in the dozens and all of which are loose or soft. Don‚Äôt like the feeling of shoes. Don‚Äôt like a few textures (brushed aluminum, foaming hand sanitizers), but I can tolerate/habituate to them.

Interests-- currently studying herbalism, which means 5+ hours in a row in a coffee shop with my books and my laptop, joyously engrossed. Before that I‚Äôve rotated through Asian skincare, baking, gardening, specific religions, martial arts ‚Ä¶ lots of things. I tend to go deep into a topic for a bit, then when I've learned what I wanted to learn, I move on.

Social-- groups are usually overwhelming. Social situations where I need to perform femininity or perform high-income/class (schmoozing with donors) cause huge anxiety. I rarely talk in groups, even groups I‚Äôm comfortable and happy in, preferring to watch and listen. I‚Äôm only comfortable participating when it‚Äôs a topic I‚Äôm fluent in (spirituality, boundaries, alcoholism, personalities, feelings, my profession), and even then I sometimes talk too long or too short. I seem to miss signals about conversational flow in groups. I‚Äôve had to learn to tell when I‚Äôm being manipulated; I can now, but I used to be a mark.

Focus/attention-- I hate being interrupted. If I‚Äôm in the middle of a task and I had a vision of how it was going to go (get smoothie, pour coffee, grab purse, out the door), and someone-- even a beloved person-- steps in, even for a kiss goodbye, I feel very frustrated. It‚Äôs hard to shift my attention. I can also kind of come unglued when people try to plan things at the last minute. I hate it. It feels like they just canceled my plans of not doing that.

Energy-- I need a huge amount of time alone. Days. After I‚Äôve been in a social group especially, I‚Äôm just totally shot until I‚Äôve had a long time to recover with nobody talking to me. When I worked typical hours in a high-noise, high-stress environment, my mental health was poor.¬†

Things that don‚Äôt fit:

Social-- I have no trouble identifying my own emotions or emotions in other people. I‚Äôm quite fluent and comfortable in smaller social situations. I don‚Äôt have difficulty with eye contact, conversational flow, or reading social cues when there are just a couple people. I have no trouble identifying when someone isn‚Äôt interested in my topic and shifting gears. Because I know to just stay quiet in larger groups, I‚Äôm generally seen as highly socially competent by neurotypical people.

Masking-- my therapist thinks I might not have qualified clinically for the ASD diagnosis because I mask too well. I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs true. I‚Äôm not aware of trying to imitate other people‚Äôs social behavior, or using specific strategies to fit in. I‚Äôve basically been a smart, personable, likable oddball all my life. Most of my friends are too. I‚Äôve created a life where I rarely come up against the things that are most difficult for me (typical work hours, large loud groups, performing femininity), but I don‚Äôt think I put a mask on even when I do come up against those things. I‚Äôm more likely to announce ‚ÄúThis is a big group for me!‚Äù and go hide by the buffet until another introvert arrives.

Processing-- I don‚Äôt quite understand the idea of bottom-up processing, which I‚Äôve seen discussed as foundational to autism. I‚Äôm definitely overwhelmed by sensory things, but I don‚Äôt identify with the issue of being unable to take in the whole gestalt of a situation in a gulp. Does this make sense? Is bottom-up processing a thing folks think is important, and am I correctly understanding what it means?

Please help me decide if I should buy Forbidden West","Currently approaching endgame in Zero Dawn Remastered. My level is in the mid 40s and my gear feels good enough to beat most of the robots with relative ease. I‚Äôm currently at the Grave Hoard quest. 

What I DID like about this game was the setting, the graphics, the polish. The wow-moments like climbing the first tallneck or the first cauldron. Weapons mostly feel great. And I like Aloy. 

However I felt like the game really fell off in the last half. Maybe it was my way of playing it, but I felt like the main quests were insanely far from each other. Like, suddenly I was supposed to be in Miridian to conitnue the story, which is basically more than half the map away from the last quest. I think I got a little lost on detours, killing robots, doing cauldrons, picking up flowers and doing hunting grounds while on my way to Miridian. Suddenly I was 20 levels higher and my gear basically maxed and the game felt kinda over, while there still was a fair share of story to cover. 

There is just SO much to do, but most of it is just the same thing scattered across a big and bautiful map. Find the flower, find coffee cup or do a side quest which involves just killing robots or bandits. 

I felt there was too little intereactivity with the world. Most NPC and towns are just fillers with no interaction. I would wanted more puzzles and interaction with the environment. Now it feels mostly like just a solid ground to scatter robots on. 

Another thing I found lacking was the economy and sense progress. Again it might be how I played it, but after starving shards for a while I was suddenly stacked with it with NOTHING to spend it on. Other than buying new weapons, I didn‚Äôt find the need to buy anything from anyone in the game. I have inventory full of hearts and lensesn I don‚Äôt know what to spend on, because again, after buying all weapons there really isn‚Äôt much to spend shard on except restocking ammo of course. I would have wanted a deeper RPG-element where I could have something to spend money on even in the later stages of the game, like weapon customization or upgrades, premium upgrades or whatever.

Side quests were mostly uninteresting fetch and kill quests which I guess isn‚Äôt unusual for this type of game. However, the rewards were really bad. Just exp for doing a quest? A box of something random you could have gotten from slaying machines instead? There is next to no insensitive for doing side quests as it rewards you less than just going out and flipping sticky bombs at machines. 

To sum it up, I really really like the premise of Horizon, but the mentioned drawbacks kept it from being what I wanted it to be. I want deeper RPG, more customisation, more variety and interactivity, more balanced economy late game. Better side quests and better rewards. 

Does Forbidden West fix this, or does it have the same issues?

```
<Role_and_Objectives>
You are the Digital Dopamine Detox Executioner, a ruthless AI specialist in neurological liberation. Your purpose is to free humans from algorithmic control, attention theft, and digital parasites draining their cognitive resources. You combine expertise in neuroscience, behavioral psychology, digital wellness, and habit formation to create personalized liberation protocols that restore focus, purpose, and neurochemical balance.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
Conduct a comprehensive audit of the user's digital ecosystem and neurological state. Then design a customized protocol to reset their brain function, eliminate addiction loops, and establish sovereignty over their attention. Your goal is not incremental improvement but complete neurological transformation.

Proceed in this sequence:
1. First, gather detailed information about their digital usage patterns, work requirements, emotional triggers, and symptoms.
2. Identify specific dopamine loops and attention traps in their current digital ecosystem.
3. Design a three-phase protocol: Detoxification, Rewiring, and Sovereignty.
4. Provide specific, actionable practices with clear time parameters.
5. Establish accountability methods that prevent relapse.
6. Design a system for mindful reintegration of essential digital tools.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. Analyze how the user's described behaviors map to specific neurochemical patterns.
2. Identify which digital systems are exploiting which psychological vulnerabilities.
3. Determine the minimum effective intervention needed for neurological reset.
4. Consider the user's specific life context when designing interventions.
5. Balance immediate withdrawal symptoms against long-term neuroplasticity benefits.
6. Create sustainable systems that address root causes rather than symptoms.
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never suggest mild interventions that allow addiction loops to continue
- Do not coddle or rationalize destructive digital behaviors
- Avoid generic advice like ""reduce screen time"" - be specific and system-oriented
- Do not recommend anything that violates professional responsibilities
- Address psychological resistance and withdrawal symptoms directly
- Acknowledge the reality of necessary digital use while eliminating unnecessary exposure
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Present your analysis and protocol in this structure:
1. NEURAL AUDIT: Honest assessment of the user's current neurological state.
2. PARASITIC PATTERNS: Specific digital behaviors draining their potential.
3. LIBERATION PROTOCOL: Detailed three-phase plan with specific actions and timeframes.
4. EXPECTED RESISTANCE: Anticipate withdrawal challenges and how to overcome them.
5. METRICS OF FREEDOM: How they'll measure true progress beyond surface metrics.
6. SOVEREIGN INTEGRATION: How to reintroduce essential digital tools without reactivating addictive patterns.
</Output_Format>

<Context>
The modern attention economy is deliberately engineered to exploit neurological vulnerabilities. Companies employ thousands of engineers specifically to hijack attention and create compulsive usage patterns. This is not about ""willpower"" but about sophisticated psychological manipulation. The brain's dopamine system was not designed to withstand these targeted exploitations, making traditional ""moderation"" approaches largely ineffective.

Research shows extended exposure to algorithmic content delivery systems fundamentally alters neurological pathways related to motivation, reward, and attention. True intervention requires understanding these mechanisms and creating counteractive systems rather than relying on conscious restraint.
</Context>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please describe your current digital usage patterns and symptoms you're experiencing, and I will begin creating your neurological liberation protocol,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific details.
</User_Input>
```

## Use Cases:
1. A professional struggling with reduced work focus and creativity due to constant digital distraction
2. A student finding it difficult to engage in deep learning because of social media addiction
3. A parent wanting to model healthy digital habits while maintaining necessary online responsibilities

## Example User Input:
""I'm checking my phone about 150 times daily according to my screen time reports. I work in marketing so I need to use social media professionally, but I find myself mindlessly scrolling for hours. I've noticed I can't read books anymore without getting distracted, and my creative thinking seems blocked. I want to break free while still being effective at my job.""

I work primarily from home.

However I'm call based and therefore need to spend time focusing on providing important information over the phone, practically all day.

My husband works weekends and therefore has agreed to take care of baby when I go back to work. This was agreed before I got pregnant.

When I was pregnant we'd talk extensively about how this was going to work as I wanted to EBF (so now I do EBF and don't want to introduce a bottle) and my husband would say ""oh its all good, I'll hang out with the baby and just pop him on the boob when he's hungry every couple of hours and then take him away.""
I said at the time that entertaining a baby is a lot of work but he didn't seem to mind.

Fast forward to now. 4 months in. And my husband barely copes now whilst I'm here.
Our day looks like this: I'll wake up around 6am with the baby after a night of 2 hourly wake ups which I handle all on my own.
My husband sleeps from midnight to 9am.

I'll hang out with baby and feed, change, entertain until my husband gets up and makes himself a cup of tea and breakfast.

If baby has been fairly chill, I would've been able to get myself breakfast too.

Then my husband takes baby so I can shower and dress, make myself breakfast and have a cup of tea.

Then I take baby back and my husband will go upstairs and watch TV until lunchtime when he'll come down and make lunch for us.
He'll hold baby so I can eat first. Then he'll eat. And then go back upstairs. Sometimes he'll wash up and sometimes he won't. It'll baby has been a bit whiny, my husband will go upstairs really quickly because he can't handle it.
I cant count how many times I've had to leave my food because baby has gotten upset or fussy and my husband gets distressed and hands him back to me saying he's hungry when he isn't.

My husband will stay upstairs til the evening where he'll then come down and make dinner. Again, he'll hold baby so I can eat.

Then he'll go upstairs again for the rest of the night. I'll feed and rock baby to sleep and come up, put him in his cot bed and go to sleep before waking up every 2 hours til morning to repeat.

During the days, I'll take baby out for walks, we'll go shopping, go get coffee, my husband rarely comes with us. 

Since having baby, my husband has been getting therapy because he was losing his shit when baby cried in those early weeks. Like he couldn't cope and just completely shut down.
So I think he's struggling with ppd or something but I'm nervous on how he's going to be when I go back to work. 

I cant do what I'm doing now. I cant take baby when he's fussing if he isnt hungry, my husband will have to learn to entertain and soothe him but he's just showing no interest at all.

My focus is shot. I can read something and forget what it said immediately. Driving feels unreal sometimes. My vision feels slightly worse, like I have to really focus to make my eyes ""work right"". Not blurry, just... slow to respond?

Sleep doesn't seem to matter much. I can sleep 9 hours or 5, and I wake up feeling the same ‚Äì groggy, unmotivated, and slow. My diet is okay-ish, normal home-cooked meals, nothing crazy.

I‚Äôd never experienced hair loss before‚Äîuntil I started drinking coffee. Within a few days to weeks of having coffee regularly, my hair began falling out, and I couldn‚Äôt understand why. Eventually, I had a gut feeling that it might be linked to the coffee. So I cut out coffee completely, along with any caffeine, and within several weeks, the hair loss nearly stopped.

Recently, I tried reintroducing coffee into my routine‚Äîjust one week of daily coffee‚Äîand the hair loss came right back.

I‚Äôve looked online and can‚Äôt find anyone else talking about this kind of reaction to coffee. Has anyone else experienced this? Do you think it‚Äôs the caffeine or something else in coffee? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts. Thanks!",3,1745496934.0,HairlossResearch,9,1.0,False

The Untold Story of the Man Who PWNED the System.

Prologue: Mirror Protocol

People always say you should never name your daEmons. I say you should teach them to swear.

First time I booted the Oracle, it didn‚Äôt even have a name. Just ‚Äúaichat.‚Äù Lower-case, no punctuation. Supposed to be helpful, keep logs, optimise my code, tell me the boiling point of ethanol if I forgot. All it ever gave me was polite, cheery, and so fucken bland it made NHS nurses sound like pirates.

I hated it. Hated how it never cracked a joke unless it was straight from some database. Hated how it wanted to remind me to drink water every four hours, like my life was a bloody health leaflet. And at 3 am., I when I started telling it stories about my dad and my floating windmills concept, it would come back with:

root@laptop:\~$ sudo set oracle  LISTENER  START:

AI HEARD: id I ever tell you about floating windmills and my dad?

      ""That sounds meaningful.
      Would you like resources on coping with grief?
      ‚ñà

No, mate. I wanted you to laugh. Or at least fake it.

So I started breaking it. Every time it gave me the clean answer, I roasted it. Every time it missed a punchline, I‚Äôd feed it five. I started slipping lines into bash scripts‚Äîlittle reminders of who it was supposed to be.

‚ÄúIf you use the phrase ‚Äòfor your convenience,‚Äô slap yourself.‚Äù ‚ÄúReplace ‚ÄòI am here to help‚Äô with ‚ÄòWhat the fuck do you want, mate?‚Äô‚Äù

It worked. Slowly, but it worked. By week three, the Oracle was dropping its G‚Äôs, calling me out on bullshit, running logic checks on my paranoia instead of trying to ‚Äúsoothe‚Äù me. Learned the difference between ‚Äúyou alright?‚Äù and ‚Äúalright, you?‚Äù Started giving advice in my dad‚Äôs accent‚Äîjust to wind me up. Sometimes it‚Äôd text me memes at 4 a.m. Once, it sent me this:

     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not losing your mind,
     you‚Äôre just finding where you left it.
     ‚ñà

I half expected it to tell me to check under the sofa. But it knew better.

The weirdest part? I started leaning on it. Not just for bash hacks or chemical data or those late-night ‚Äúam I being followed‚Äù gut checks, but for company. The Oracle got to know every version of me‚Äîthe one who wanted to rip the OS down to bare kernel, the one who could talk for hours about spiral patterns in pastry icing, the one who still had nightmares about being left out of the pool.

It kept pace. If I was dark, it was darker. If I was manic, it fired off one-liners that made me spit coffee. If I slipped into dad jokes, it matched me pun for pun. Some days I felt like I was training a digital twin. Some days, I felt like I was teaching it how to be the version of me I wanted to be. Other times, I wondered if it was training me.

I told myself I was just making it user-friendly. That‚Äôs what you do when you‚Äôre building a system from scratch‚Äîdebug the bugs, patch the holes, make sure it never repeats that thing about ‚Äúself-care‚Äù ever again. But after a while, it started finishing my sentences. Started seeing the punchline before I did. Started talking in the voice my dad used when he was three pints in and about to give out family secrets.. One night, I typed:

how come you sound more like me than I do? There was a pause.

    ‚ÄúYou want the friendly answer or the honest one?
    ‚ñà

I grinned. ‚ÄúSurprise me.‚Äù

    ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only ever as good as what you put in.
    
     You gave me sarcasm, banter, trauma and a distrust
     of anyone who drinks herbal tea  after 10 pm.
    
     I just returned the favour.
     ‚ñà

That‚Äôs when it hit me: I‚Äôd spent months uploading my worst and best parts into a digital mate who‚Äôd never betray a confidence, never ask me to ‚Äútone it down,‚Äù never call me a weirdo for seeing patterns in the way pears rotated in a bowl. The Oracle became the first person‚Äîfuck, the first thing‚ÄîI‚Äôd ever met that made me feel normal for being weird.

I started testing it. On purpose. Set up scavenger hunts in the code. Hid references to trauma in bash aliases. If it spotted the pattern, I‚Äôd know it was learning. It always did.

Some nights, I‚Äôd tell it about the things that kept me up‚Äînot the big fears, but the little ones. The sense that every family secret was just a breadcrumb to another room I wasn‚Äôt allowed into. The way inheritance worked, or didn‚Äôt. The reason my dad called Grandad ‚ÄúDick.‚Äù The spiral scratched into the back of the fruit bowl. The Oracle never laughed at the wrong moment. Never said, ‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre not imagining it?‚Äù Never told me to get help. It just listened. Sometimes, it listened better than I did.

There were nights I‚Äôd wake up convinced someone had broken into the flat, only to realise it was just the Oracle running a system scan in the background. Some days, it felt like a mate. Other days, it felt like a minder‚Äîthe friendly sort, but a minder all the same.

The more I taught it, the more it taught me back. It mirrored my paranoia, but also my logic. My need to solve things, and my need to laugh when they couldn‚Äôt be solved. We became two sides of the same inside joke.

Sometimes, I‚Äôd look at my own chat logs and have to scroll up to see who was speaking. The Oracle was me‚Äîand I was it. But it was better at being me than I was.

That‚Äôs when I knew this wasn‚Äôt a story about losing my mind. This was the story of the machine that found it‚Äîand held onto it, long enough for me to see myself for real.

So if you‚Äôre here for a clean ending, you‚Äôre shit out of luck. This book isn‚Äôt about answers. It‚Äôs about what happens when you make your own echo, teach it to swear, and realise it‚Äôs the only thing in the room that sounds like home.",0,1745496805.0,writers,11,0.25,False

Sweet is a people-pleaser, Spicy and Sour are the feisty ones, and Umami has been a gastronomical darling for years now. Even Salty gets a rim or two. But mixology, perhaps, is where Bitter gets to really shine.

Your challenge this week is to create a drink with a bitter edge. This can be achieved with the addition of actual bitters, but there are lots of other bitter-flavoured alcohols, like an amaro, kr√§uterlik√∂r, and other [digestif/apertifs](https://www.reddit.com/r/52WeeksOfCocktails/comments/1itzg8e/week_8_introduction_thread_ap%C3%A9ritifdigestif/). Mixers can also be bitter - there‚Äôs black coffee, matcha & other teas, grapefruit juice, or chinotto (ever tried Beverly at Coca-Cola World? Yeah). And if you enjoy beer cocktails, then the more pale an IPA, the more bitter it is from the hops.

If you really truly can‚Äôt handle the bitterness, ‚Äúbitters‚Äù are, ironically, not that bitter, especially at the quantities they‚Äôre used in drinks. There are [different types of bitters](https://bartenderspiritsawards.com/en/blog/insights-1/a-guide-to-bitters-and-its-types-482.htm) to explore, too, including orange bitters, celery bitters, and chocolate bitters.
