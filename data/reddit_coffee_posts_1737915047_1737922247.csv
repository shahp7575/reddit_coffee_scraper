I have a situation I didn't think me and my current girlfriend have got into and I just want advice on my next steps going forward and some clarity on the things she is saying to me. I'll try structure this so its somewhat palatable, rather than a huge brick of text. I'll start with the day of the breakup and work back from there.

**The Breakup**  
So yesterday, my girlfriend suggested going on a breakfast date. We went on that and enjoyed it. We then went to look to book an appointment with a mortgage advisor cause we were planning on buying a house together. We then did some shopping, saw her bother and her niece then went home. From that point she seem to sink into a low mood and said she didn't feel good.

We was due to watch an Ice Hockey game last night together with her brother, her brothers girlfriend and her niece as well as a few friends. She told me to go on my own as she wasn't feeling good and I thought she may have needed some space. I helped her by giving her some vitamins that normally help her feel better, gave her a clementine to boost her up a bit we then kissed and I left at about 6pm.

I return home at around midnight having been to the game, she seemed really quiet and in her own head. I gave her a kiss on the forehead, got ready for bed and climbed in. After about 5 mins of silence, she breaks the silence with ""I want to break up"".

**My Immediate Actions - Immediately post breakup.**

I got out of bed and moved to face her at the front of the bed to talk about it. She said that she didn't want a back and forth, just that we are no longer together. No matter what I tried to say to her, she wouldn't listen to me. I realized that my efforts to communicate were not being reciprocated and I began to get up and get changed.

It was at this point where she was visibly and audibly confused and annoyed for why I was getting up at 12:30am. I told her that there is no point in me laying in bed next to her reminiscing on all our relationship while counting down the minutes to when I had to get up and pack. At this point, I was angry and confused but being that I'm quite reserved, I didn't want to show her an angry side of me as her last view of me. I began packing an overnight bag to go to my mums.

Though out this section, she kept telling me that she wanted to breakup amicably and that she didn't want any hard feelings from me. That maybe in a couple years time, we might get back together. While I packed, she went downstairs and shut herself in the kitchen to wait for me to finish.

**Today - First full day single**

When I woke up this morning (which is not really what I did cause I didn't even sleep having so much on my mind) I had a message from her saying that she was going to pack my essentials for me tonight after she finished her shift and she was going to bring it to me. She was then going to pack the rest and bring it the following week.

At this point, being that I bugged out, I didn't really have much with me and I needed some stuff. So without messaging her back, I just went to her parents (where we lived) and grabbed the majority of my stuff. Her parents love me and are as annoyed and confused as I am for this whole scenario. They were mentioning that it was just the other day she was singing my praises about how good I was as a boyfriend and how she's never had so much trust for someone and blah blah.

I had a massive chat with her parents who were going to talk to her tonight over Sunday dinner to see what drove her to this.

Ngl, this packing my stuff up and saying good bye to her dog and her parents really did get to me.

I wrote her a hand written note and hid it in her room (that was something I liked to do) I then replied to her message from the morning to say something along the lines of ""just to make it easier for you, I've came and got a big bulk of the stuff."" Which she interoperated as me not wanting to see her. ngl, I didn't. I'm not really in a good state rn so I didn't fancy facing her.

I then left her house.

**Some of the messages she sent me**

During driving home, she told me she will be out of the house until late tomorrow night if i wanted an opportunity to get my stuff without her there. I replied that I don't really want to take my stuff cause I feel like its something we can work on. She turned down every opportunity to work on this and focused on sticking to her guns.

I get another message saying she's leaving my free gym membership active for me at the gym she manages and that her brother still wants to come to hockey practice and public skating sessions with me. Her parents have also invited me round for Sunday dinners too. This to me feel unusual of someone wanting to break up and cut ties.

she kept mentioning how she wants it all to be amicable <- using that word too. How she doesn't want to cut me off and what not. at this point I just replied ""okay"" cause I was done bargaining. I value my relationship highly, but I know what too much bargaining looks like so I decided to stop before i went too far.

**My final message to her**

I messaged her with this before we stopped talking ""I understand that you want to keep things amicable between us and I appreciate you for keeping my free gym membership active and keeping my connections with your brother. But I'm really struggling to process this right now. I think I'm going to need some time to step back, gather some clarity and process this and these emotions.

Which she replied to with ""well we'll just cut contact, I'll do what i said before an you can just come by and collect your stuff in your own time. I wish you the best x""

I then told her that I didn't want to cut ties with her, I just need some time away from this to figure this all out. I then replied ""I really care about you so please don't forget that. You're not cut out of my life from my side I just feel like we both need the space right now to process our emotions. I do hope everything works out well for you moving forward.

She then replied ""I will give you the space you need"" which I love heart reacted.

**A brief back story**

I know I've been rambling a lot but all of this is so fresh I just need a place to offload.

Me and my ex got together and moved in quite quickly. We live out of 1 room in her parents house which we basically spend all of our time in. It's a huge room with a sofa, big TV, en-suite + double shower, cuddle chair, coffee machine, fridge, kettle. You name it. I have mentioned once or twice when she has been stressed that I think we may have rushed into things too quickly without addressing both our internal issues first. But space is something she says isn't something she likes to do and she doesn't want it.

My ex is someone who suffers from mental health issues, I know she has chronic depression and I believe she may also be bipolar. This just makes all this way more complex than just a simple breakup. Like everyone with mental health issues, she had good days/weeks/months. And days/weeks where she was really low and really down. During these low spots, she was extremely irritable and almost anything external to the relationship that upset her usually got used as ammo in our relationship.

About 2 or 3 months ago, she stopped taking her antidepressants. She was on a ridiculously high dose which she came off complete cold turkey. This did put strain on us but not hugely. Also, about a month ago, she had her implant removed and replaced with the coil, which I think is really messing with her.

I am very patient and understanding and since being with my girlfriend, I only got even more patient and understanding with her. I knew what I signed up for when I got with her. She's adventurous, extremely caring, she is very sure of herself, even if that stubbornness was sometimes not a good idea. She was a teacher (not in the career sense), she taught me to cook as well as teaching me life lessons like: store bread in the freezer and it lasts forever. Never wash all your clothes in 1 load, separate the colours etc. things that most people get taught growing up. I loved her for this cause she was trying to better me as a person so I could be a better person in our relationship.

I could go on about the amazing qualities she had despite her adversities, but I'm being conscious that this is already pretty long.

One thing she has been through though is 2 abusive relationships before me. One of the relationships required counselling which taught her a valuable lesson in removing people from her life.

For the past few months, we've been house shopping. We've been trying to meet with mortgage advisors to talk with them to workout our finances. We had a joint bank account. We had joint bills etc we had a joint car! She'd always say affirming things to me like how good I was to be with, how I make her life easier and how she cant see herself with anyone else etc.

**I'll try wrap this up here.**

I am confused as to what to do, all of this seems to come out of the blue. I think she's in a low spot and not thinking clearly but I don't want to cling to fibers of the rug that was just pulled from under me today.

Right now I'm just unpacking my stuff in my room which is making me a bit emotional. I've been remembering how magical and exciting it was with me and her sat on the floor unpacking my stuff at her house for the first time. Now I'm back in my alcoholic mothers on my own unpacking. It did really get to me.

I just hope the person I fell in love with is still in there, and I hope she remembers me as someone she loved to be around. Her parents said they were going to try talk to her to see if she'd be open to hashing things out but I'm not hopeful.

I just don't know if this whole ""amicable"" thing, helping me out with a free gym and connections into her family, is a way of saying that she doesn't really trust herself on this decision she made. I really really don't know.

I'm really struggling. It's at this point here she'd come to me with open arms and cuddle me but cause I have just moved out, I just cant get that cuddle that my heart is craving.

I'm not one for grand gestures. But do I turn up to her house unannounced with flowers and chocolate and try show her that she means so much to me, or should I give her space and hope that she'll potentially see sense?

(As I've been typing this, I have had a notification from my bank to say that our joint account has been deleted)

  
**TLDR**

I know this is long so this is really needed. 

I’m really confused and hurt after my girlfriend unexpectedly broke up with me, even though we were close and had plans for a future together. We moved in together quickly, and she has struggled with mental health issues like chronic depression and possibly bipolar disorder. She recently stopped taking her antidepressants and switched birth control, which might have affected her mood. The breakup happened after we shared a date day together, and now she’s sending mixed signals—offering to keep my free gym membership active (a perk from her job) and saying we can stay friends. I’m torn between giving her space or making a gesture to show her I care. I feel lost and don’t know if she’s acting impulsively because of her mental health struggles or if she actually wants this.

**{**Once we became heads of this village I did a rough sketch based on historical Rokugani / Japanese village layouts. To the right as you look at the map, about half an hour's walk, is the Kintani river. We're located about half way between Otosan Uchi and Toshi Ranbo.

 Eventually as I gained points in WotD I added things like a paved market area around the central well, inner and outer walls (double layer wooden with sand & scree to give added strength.) For anyone who knows their history, yes the zig-zag lines are trenches, they have a deep wall on the outside and a shallow exit facing the village wall so if enemy forces get into the trenches they're easy prey for archers or teppo gunners on the walls. The little diamond shaped things are likewise defensive in nature. Cairns of stacked rock that provide good cover just in case the peasants (ashiguaru - we instituted a universal levee for anyone able to fight)  get caught in the field and need to flee somewhere. In the cairns are stockpiled parangu, bows and arrows, basic medical supplies, fresh water, and rations. 

In the left middle upper quadrant of the main village you can see our 'miniature shiro.' Besides serving as a living quarters for the Kuroi Koneko's large 'manson family' arrangement, the elevated palisade served as a gun deck for our cannon and mortars as it commanded an excellent all round view of the fields and the village. The top of the 'shiro' contained a 'crow's nest' equipped with a heliograph, powerful oil burning signal lamp, signal flag mast, and flares. We could communicate with every other village in a 100km radius in good weather, and spot approaching trouble with plenty of time to spare to call up the ashigaru and budoka, and get the weapons run out. 

Finally when we rebuilt the village we dug deep, wide 'irrigation ditches' and the covered them over. Scorpion are consummate tunnelers and Hanei-no-Mura has an underground tunnel and bunker system that would make Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap (leader of the Vietnamese armed forces) proud. We had spider-holes everywhere that archers or raiders could pop up from and then dissapear. We had even sunk underground wells, and stockpiled years worth of food. Though no real defense against a giant Clan army, Hanei No Mura is a very tough nut to crack, it's fortifications designed primarily around giving it's population time to evacuate safely to the river and the fleet of sampans and kobune we had waiting there.**}**

***Today I'm positive I earned an iaijutsu channenge from a kikita duelist SOMEWHERE in the Empire: My wife was doing laundry in the kitchen (we live in a postage stamp apartment and have portable washer and dryer) and so I couldn't get to the sink to get water for my matcha latte. Instead I used the cold espresso still in my coffee pot to mix the powder in before adding milk and brown sugar. Yummy, but an offense according to any right-minded Crane to be sure.*** ",1,1737921853.0,rokugan,0,1.0,False

Important info is that I do have a mental illness, which however isnt affecting my work at all. The higher-ups are aware though.  I'm in my 5th year of teaching and on Thursday I have been informed that I will have a disciplinary meeting on Monday (tomorrow). The allegations against me are, that I often come very late (10 min or more) to my lessons, caused by me chatting to colleagues / drinking coffee in the lounge or something. 

My first years have in fact been difficult and yes I did come a bit late to my lessons a handful of times because I was chatting. This topic however got discussed in my yearly evaluation meeting 2 years ago and I improved by a lot. I can confidently say that I am not doing that anymore. On the contrary, I even put my own needs behind in order to ease the work of my colleagues - like sacrificing my own breaks to make space for the others to have breaks. 

The only issue which causes me to occasionally be late is the colleagues themselves being late. So if I teach class 1A in the 2nd lesson and need to teach 4E in the 3rd I have to wait for another adult to take my post as to not leave kids unattended. This, however, as indicated by my principal is ""not always the case and everyone knows it"". 

Some of my colleagues who found me crying my eyes out in the teacher lounge after I got the news rallied together and went on my behalf to ask what the principal is thinking to do something sh\*t like this. They all agree with me making progress and all agree they havent seen me come late ""on purpose"" since forever.

It’s like she somehow couldn’t hear her dog barking loudly and couldn’t see that everyone in the shop was staring at her. Thankfully one of the baristas came out from the back after hearing all the barking, saw me getting super uncomfortable, and came up to that girl and told her she couldn’t have animals in there. I was so grateful for that barista, and thankfully the owner was nice about that and left with her dogs. My encounter had a (rare) good ending. It was still annoying though.

1iaof98,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1iaof98/disgustingly_and_morbidly_selfneglectful_and_not/,Disgustingly and morbidly self-neglectful; and not one person would ever have a clue,"Hello everyone.

This is something I've needed off my chest for a while, as it's extremely severe, and I couldn't imagine anyone in my life finding out or knowing about this...

See, I keep a close watch of the way I'm perceived, and my public image, specifically/most severely in my career. I'm meticulous about my physical appearance, and I have a particular 'mask' I put on at work: strong, reserved, resilient, 'quiet' (but definitely not because I'm shy or introverted) but gets shit done. 

With this figurative 'mask' I wear, there are a lot of people in my life who view me as this extremely resilient, perfectly imperfect person. I don't come off to others as perfect; far from it, actually. But I excell in my career fields; and I mean, I REALLY do well, and others can see that. I care more about the people close to me, and just other human beings in general, more than i think anyone can say or show for. I get complimented on my appearance constantly, and told how beautifully intimidating I am, etc. (I have extreme insecurities about my appearance, to an unhealthy level, but that is besides the point of this post, at least). 

All of this being said, certain parts of me are far too grotesque (and I mean, quite literally disgusting and sad) to show to anyone. And I mean, anyone.

I need to let you all know that I don't take care of myself- at all. Well, I do, but only when I need to look 'put together' in the ""outside world"". 

I neglect just about everything there is you can think of when it comes to my personal health and well-being. I barely sleep, I struggle to shower, I forget to eat constantly, and when I finally remember, I eat way too much and it's nothing good for me (yes, I am extremely meticulous about my weight, and have taken extremely unhealthy measures to get to where I want). I don't take care of my health, at all, unless it gets to them point where something is physically unbearably painful, or it messes up my appearance. 

All of this is related to (and provides some context for) what I REALLY need to get off my chest: I also neglect my home. I have severe, diagnosed ADHD (I'm sure this contributes to all the above), and I am extremely meticulous about my home's appearance and ""aesthetic"". I know how to clean, and frankly, I can't live in a place that ISNT clean, or where everything doesn't match and align perfectly to how I want it to look.

That is, until something gets messed up; and that something could be anything. One day, I might not do the dishes from dinner the night-of. Or maybe, I don't take the trash out one time. It could be anything, and we'll, that anything then turns into EVERYTHING.

And that's exactly what happened. For 2 months now, I have been staying at a friend's house, donating rent to my apartment complex while I stay as far away from it as humanly possible. Why? Well, it started with some trash piled up on the counter. Then suddenly, there's dirty dishes, trash, old food, and anything else you can possibly think of- EVERYWHERE. Then, it continues to pile, worse and worse. I can't get myself to do ANYTHING. And as it piles, mold grows. The mold doesn't stop growing and it's in every color of the rainbow.

Now, there's flies and fungus and gnats and whatever the hell else everywhere. Just everywhere. Dirty clothes on the floor, old coffee cups overflowing with mold and insects surrounding it. 

It got so overwhelming, that I left. And I haven't been back there, despite the amount of rent i pay on the place that takes half my paycheck. I've been escaping it. And it hurts. I want it fixed so badly. I like my apartment, I miss how beautiful and pleasing it was to be in there. Funny enough, I enjoy cleaning when I do it; i actually have the best time cleaning and organizing and decorating. So why haven't I been able to? Why can't I JUST do it? It's so fucking easy. And it's so disgusting that I could even live like this or let something get to this state.

What the fuck is wrong with me. Why can't I do this. No one knows how disgusting I am, how broken I am, how unbelievably self-neglecting i am. I am a liar to everyone I know- because if they knew this about me, I couldn't even imagine what they'd think or do. ",1,1737921180.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I have a situation I didn't think me and my current girlfriend have got into and I just want advice on my next steps going forward and some clarity on the things she is saying to me. I'll try structure this so its somewhat palatable, rather than a huge brick of text. I'll start with the day of the breakup and work back from there.  

**The Breakup**  
So yesterday, my girlfriend suggested going on a breakfast date. We went on that and enjoyed it. We then went to look to book an appointment with a mortgage advisor cause we were planning on buying a house together. We then did some shopping, saw her bother and her niece then went home. From that point she seem to sink into a low mood and said she didn't feel good. 

We was due to watch an Ice Hockey game last night together with her brother, her brothers girlfriend and her niece as well as a few friends. She told me to go on my own as she wasn't feeling good and I thought she may have needed some space. I helped her by giving her some vitamins that normally help her feel better, gave her a clementine to boost her up a bit we then kissed and I left at about 6pm.

I return home at around midnight having been to the game, she seemed really quiet and in her own head. I gave her a kiss on the forehead, got ready for bed and climbed in. After about 5 mins of silence, she breaks the silence with ""I want to break up"".

  
**My Immediate Actions - Immediately post breakup.**

I got out of bed and moved to face her at the front of the bed to talk about it. She said that she didn't want a back and forth, just that we are no longer together. No matter what I tried to say to her, she wouldn't listen to me. I realized that my efforts to communicate were not being reciprocated and I began to get up and get changed.

It was at this point where she was visibly and audibly confused and annoyed for why I was getting up at 12:30am. I told her that there is no point in me laying in bed next to her reminiscing on all our relationship while counting down the minutes to when I had to get up and pack. At this point, I was angry and confused but being that I'm quite reserved, I didn't want to show her an angry side of me as her last view of me. I began packing an overnight bag to go to my mums.

Though out this section, she kept telling me that she wanted to breakup amicably and that she didn't want any hard feelings from me. That maybe in a couple years time, we might get back together. While I packed, she went downstairs and shut herself in the kitchen to wait for me to finish. 

**Today - First full day single**

When I woke up this morning (which is not really what I did cause I didn't even sleep having so much on my mind) I had a message from her saying that she was going to pack my essentials for me tonight after she finished her shift and she was going to bring it to me. She was then going to pack the rest and bring it the following week. 

At this point, being that I bugged out, I didn't really have much with me and I needed some stuff. So without messaging her back, I just went to her parents (where we lived) and grabbed the majority of my stuff. Her parents love me and are as annoyed and confused as I am for this whole scenario. They were mentioning that it was just the other day she was singing my praises about how good I was as a boyfriend and how she's never had so much trust for someone and blah blah.  

I had a massive chat with her parents who were going to talk to her tonight over Sunday dinner to see what drove her to this. 

Ngl, this packing my stuff up and saying good bye to her dog and her parents really did get to me. 

I wrote her a hand written note and hid it in her room (that was something I liked to do) I then replied to her message from the morning to say something along the lines of ""just to make it easier for you, I've came and got a big bulk of the stuff."" Which she interoperated as me not wanting to see her. ngl, I didn't. I'm not really in a good state rn so I didn't fancy facing her. 

I then left her house.

**Some of the messages she sent me**

During driving home, she told me she will be out of the house until late tomorrow night if i wanted an opportunity to get my stuff without her there. I replied that I don't really want to take my stuff cause I feel like its something we can work on. She turned down every opportunity to work on this and focused Ikkdkdkdkkdkd on sticking to her guns.

I get another message saying she's leaving my free gym membership active for me at the gym she manages and that her brother still wants to come to hockey practice and public skating sessions with me. Her parents have also invited me round for Sunday dinners too. This to me feel unusual of someone wanting to break up and cut ties. 

she kept mentioning how she wants it all to be amicable <- using that word too. How she doesn't want to cut me off and what not. at this point I just replied ""okay"" cause I was done bargaining. I value my relationship highly, but I know what too much bargaining looks like so I decided to stop before i went too far. 

**My final message to her**

I messaged her with this before we stopped talking ""I understand that you want to keep things amicable between us and I appreciate you for keeping my free gym membership active and keeping my connections with your brother. But I'm really struggling to process this right now. I think I'm going to need some time to step back, gather some clarity and process this and these emotions. 

Which she replied to with ""well we'll just cut contact, I'll do what i said before an you can just come by and collect your stuff in your own time. I wish you the best x""

I then told her that I didn't want to cut ties with her, I just need some time away from this to figure this all out. I then replied ""I really care about you so please don't forget that. You're not cut out of my life from my side I just feel like we both need the space right now to process our emotions. I do hope everything works out well for you moving forward. 

She then replied ""I will give you the space you need"" which I love heart reacted.

**A brief back story**

I know I've been rambling a lot but all of this is so fresh I just need a place to offload. 

Me and my ex got together and moved in quite quickly. We live out of 1 room in her parents house which we basically spend all of our time in. It's a huge room with a sofa, big TV, en-suite + double shower, cuddle chair, coffee machine, fridge, kettle. You name it. I have mentioned once or twice when she has been stressed that I think we may have rushed into things too quickly without addressing both our internal issues first. But space is something she says isn't something she likes to do and she doesn't want it.

My ex is someone who suffers from mental health issues, I know she has chronic depression and I believe she may also be bipolar. This just makes all this way more complex than just a simple breakup. Like everyone with mental health issues, she had good days/weeks/months. And days/weeks where she was really low and really down. During these low spots, she was extremely irritable and almost anything external to the relationship that upset her usually got used as ammo in our relationship.

About 2 or 3 months ago, she stopped taking her antidepressants. She was on a ridiculously high dose which she came off complete cold turkey. This did put strain on us but not hugely. Also, about a month ago, she had her implant removed and replaced with the coil, which I think is really messing with her. 

I am very patient and understanding and since being with my girlfriend, I only got even more patient and understanding with her.  I knew what I signed up for when I got with her. She's adventurous, extremely caring, she is very sure of herself, even if that stubbornness was sometimes not a good idea. She was a teacher (not in the career sense), she taught me to cook as well as teaching me life lessons like: store bread in the freezer and it lasts forever. Never wash all your clothes in 1 load, separate the colours etc. things that most people get taught growing up. I loved her for this cause she was trying to better me as a person so I could be a better person in our relationship. 

I could go on about the amazing qualities she had despite her adversities, but I'm being conscious that this is already pretty long.

One thing she has been through though is 2 abusive relationships before me. One of the relationships required counselling which taught her a valuable lesson in removing people from her life.

For the past few months, we've been house shopping. We've been trying to meet with mortgage advisors to talk with them to workout our finances. We had a joint bank account. We had joint bills etc we had a joint car! She'd always say affirming things to me like how good I was to be with, how I make her life easier and how she cant see herself with anyone else etc.

**I'll try wrap this up here.**

I am confused as to what to do, all of this seems to come out of the blue. I think she's in a low spot and not thinking clearly but I don't want to cling to fibers of the rug that was just pulled from under me today. 

Right now I'm just unpacking my stuff in my room which is making me a bit emotional. I've been remembering how magical and exciting it was with me and her sat on the floor unpacking my stuff at her house for the first time. Now I'm back in my alcoholic mothers on my own unpacking. It did really get to me.

I just hope the person I fell in love with is still in there, and I hope she remembers me as someone she loved to be around. Her parents said they were going to try talk to her to see if she'd be open to hashing things out but I'm not hopeful.

I just don't know if this whole ""amicable"" thing, helping me out with a free gym and connections into her family, is a way of saying that she doesn't really trust herself on this decision she made. I really really don't know. 

I'm really struggling. It's at this point here she'd come to me with open arms and cuddle me but cause I have just moved out, I just cant get that cuddle that my heart is craving.

I'm not one for grand gestures. But do I turn up to her house unannounced with flowers and chocolate and try show her that she means so much to me, or should I give her space and hope that she'll potentially see sense?

The coffee I pulled was one of the best things I've ever drunk and it became something of an addiction. Every hour of the day I had the desire to dive back into this great moment. Round body, chocolate notes, orange bitters - it was like poetry. 

I thought for a long time that Nespresso made really great coffee and today I can't drink the stuff any more!

It will certainly take a lot of nerve to recreate this first-class shot!

I should have spoke up when I checked in but i was told $100 at that time which is pretty standard.


 a coffee spill happened about 2 days in as they do and we cleaned it up. when we returned towels the housekeeper make it obvious she was counting them and made a face about the coffee one. we apologized because we felt the carpet would have been more expensive to just leave it and we did actually get the carpet clean. she left and then returned to complain about it again, and we apologized again. nothing more was said. we checked out, took pictures as we left. 


a week goes by and the deposit isnt returned. i call and they will call back after they speak with the manager. a day goes by and nothing so we drive back in person to ask for our money back. the lady gets very defensive raising her voice and saying there was blood in the room and they had to throw a bunch of stuff away ad nauseum. just that she was right and there was no way in hell we were getting a penny back pictures or not. i didnt want to get the police involved so i left. 

i left a Google review and basically it was a sorry not sorry response. i also noted the pill and earring we found since the lady was so in our face about the ""blood"" and how gross we were.

Have you ever wondered if your daily tooth brushing routine is the secret to achieving a dazzling, white smile? Many people hope that simply brushing their teeth will magically transform their yellowed or stained teeth into a Hollywood-worthy grin. While brushing is crucial for oral hygiene, the relationship between brushing and tooth whitening is more complex than you might think. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the truth about tooth whitening, diving deep into how brushing impacts tooth color and what you can realistically expect from your oral care routine.

Understanding Tooth Discoloration: Why Teeth Become Stained

Tooth discoloration is a common concern for many people. Several factors contribute to teeth losing their natural white shine:

• Food and drink (coffee, tea, red wine)
• Tobacco use
• Age
• Poor oral hygiene
• Certain medications
• Genetic factors

While brushing alone cannot completely whiten teeth, it plays a critical role in maintaining tooth color and preventing further staining. Regular brushing helps remove surface stains and prevents the buildup of plaque that can make teeth appear yellower.

Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

The Science Behind Tooth Brushing and Whitening

Brushing your teeth does more than just clean them. When you brush:

1. You remove surface stains caused by daily food and drink
2. You prevent plaque buildup that can yellow teeth
3. You disrupt bacterial growth that can cause discoloration

However, standard toothpaste isn't designed to significantly whiten teeth. **Most toothpastes contain mild abrasives** that can help remove surface stains, but they won't dramatically change tooth color.

Whitening Potential of Different Brushing Techniques

Not all brushing is created equal. To maximize your tooth's potential brightness:

• Use a soft-bristled toothbrush
• Brush for full two minutes
• Use gentle, circular motions
• Choose a toothpaste with gentle whitening properties

Professional Whitening vs. Brushing

While brushing is essential, professional whitening treatments offer more dramatic results. These treatments use:

• Hydrogen peroxide
• Carbamide peroxide
• Advanced bleaching techniques

These methods can lighten teeth several shades, something regular brushing cannot achieve. Dentists can provide:

1. In-office whitening treatments
2. Custom take-home whitening kits
3. Professional advice on maintaining white teeth

Natural Whitening Strategies to Complement Brushing

Beyond standard brushing, consider these natural whitening strategies:

• Oil pulling with coconut oil
• Eating crunchy fruits and vegetables
• Limiting staining foods and drinks
• Using baking soda occasionally
• Staying hydrated

Important note: Always consult with a dental professional before trying new oral care techniques.

Potential Risks of Over-Aggressive Whitening

Be cautious about excessive whitening attempts. Risks include:

• Tooth sensitivity
• Gum irritation
• Enamel damage
• Uneven coloration

**Moderation and professional guidance are key** to maintaining a healthy, white smile.

Conclusion: The Realistic Approach to Tooth Whitening

While brushing teeth won't magically transform deeply stained teeth to brilliant white, it remains a fundamental component of maintaining tooth color and overall oral health. Combining consistent, proper brushing with occasional professional treatments and smart lifestyle choices can help you achieve and maintain a brighter smile. Remember, the most important aspect of oral care is not perfection, but consistent, mindful attention to your dental hygiene routine that keeps your teeth healthy and looking their best.",1,1737920705.0,Teethgumhealth,0,1.0,False

I've found this subreddit very helpful while planning, so thanks for that. My husband and I are finally ticking Iceland off our list at the end of April. We decided we are going to try to taking our baby who will be 6 months at the time. My in-laws are also joining us to help out. I have a few questions about our approximate itinerary.

A couple notes: we're experienced backpackers, hikers, and travelers. My in-laws are also in good shape and do big national park road trips in the U.S. every summer, so getting out and hiking is the focus. Baby does great in the carrier hiking (so far). That said, my MIL is very willing to hang back and hold the baby while we do things like a glacier hike or hot springs that he can't join for. (I know, she's the best.) We also have to stop every two hours of driving to get him out of the car seat, but we're planning to hit stops on the drive, so that shouldn't be an issue.

We're doing 9 days. So obviously we won't make it up to to the north, even tho I'd love to. I planned to do south/west coast. This is our rough list. We know we may not get to everything, and that's okay.

**Day 1:** Reykjavík (2 nights)

Land, get rental car, Blue Lagoon?, nap, explore Reykjavík, Rainbow rd, take it easy

**Day 2:** Golden circle

Coffee, drive to Istex (wool tour), hiking in Thingvellir, Fredheimer Greenhouse, Hot springs (Laugarvatn, Secret Lagoon, or Hrunalog), Gullfoss Falls, Stay in Reykjavik again

**Day 3:** Aurora Igloo (1 night)

Horse tour?, hit anything we missed in golden circle on the way out of town, Caves of Hella, Maybe Westman Islands day trip?

**Day 4:** Hofn (2 nights)

Waterfalls road trip on the way, Thorsmark, Dyeholaey, Reynisfjara Beach, hike Solheimajokull?,

**Day 5:** Vatnajökull Glacier hike 

Guided glacier tour half day, explore Hofn, dinner, stay in Hofn again

**Day 6:** Start drive back to Hvolsvollur (2 nights)

(Alternate horse tour day), Vestrahorn?, Diamond Beach, Glacier Lagoon, Fjaðrárgljúfur canyon, Svartifoss, hit spots we missed, stay in cabin

**Day 7:** Hvolsvollur 

Hike Sigoldugljufar? Landmannalauger?, Optional stay at cabin day and chill

**Day 8:** Drive to Borgarnes (2 nights)

Reykjadalur Thermal River, Gljúfrabúi, Check out Borgarnes, take it easy

**Day 9:** Snæfellsnes day trip

Snæfellsjökull National Park, drive around peninsula, Arnastrapi, Grundarfoss, 2nd night in cabin in Borgarnes

**Day 10:** Back to airport

Check out, make way back, hit anything missed, alternate Blue Lagoon day

  
My questions are... how are glacier hikes around Vik compared to Vatnajokull? Should we stay closer and skip Hofn? We would really like to do one guided glacier hike, ideally not the absolute easiest version. Also everyone recommends Westman Island but there doesn't seem to be that much to do there? Just wondering where people rank it in importance.

Many users have argued that facts cannot be racist, which is true. However, much of what is purported to be factual is actually twisted by inherent racism. For example, the assertion that black people commit more violent crime than white people is false: In fact, black people are arrested/convicted for violent crime more often than white people. The statistic does not represent a fact-based commentary on a racial proclivity; it represents a way in which systemic racism has unfairly maligned a historically marginalised portion of the population.

Furthermore, even objective facts can be presented in a manner that promotes (or is promoted by) a racist agenda. It may be factual to state that a given entertainer is Jewish, for instance, but if that point is being raised as a means of insinuating something anti-Semitic, it is nonetheless an example of bigotry. Statements of this sort are referred to as ""dog-whistles;"" as coded phrases that are ostensibly based in fact, but which are being presented with bad-faith intentions.

Dog-whistles, implied bigotry, and memetic phrases with bigoted subtexts are all forbidden.  Please note that there's a different between attacking a disparaged group who cannot change how they were born, and attacking memberships of groups (e.g. saying ""ACAB"" is not bigotry.  Cops can quit, black people can't stop being black).

Civil criticism of religion, governments, and groups/organisations are fully permitted. Attacks on individuals for belonging to those groups, or veiled attacks that are instead meant to target and attack a nation/race of people that practice these faiths, is forbidden.

Any language which ascribes the behaviour of an individual to an entire group, or vice versa, is unacceptable.

Every human deserves to be treated as a human.  No exceptions.

By the third month, he asked me to visit my country so we could meet in person. Before meeting, we both agreed that we were looking for a serious relationship. Everything seemed great. I agreed to pick him up from the airport, and he rented a nice apartment for us to stay in together.

After picking him up, we went to grab some convenience food, and I ended up paying for both of us—not a big deal. The next day, I surprised him by renting a beautiful beachfront apartment for two nights. While we were there, I noticed he had taken my toothpaste without asking and put it in his bag. When I asked if he’d seen it, he admitted it and said, “Yeah, I’m sorry, I forgot mine.” I let it go, but the same thing happened with my sunscreen.

During the trip, I noticed I was covering most of the expenses. I paid for meals, and the only thing he offered to buy was water. I even paid for two tickets to a food concert, while he only got us coffee. Meanwhile, we were intimate during the trip, and he kept bringing up the idea of me moving to his country. I was open to it because I thought he was serious about us.

However, after he returned home, his communication became slow. He claimed he was busy, but after two weeks of barely hearing from him, I decided to confront him. I asked if he had thought about us and our plans, but he said he didn’t want to define anything yet, though he felt “a connection.” I told him that was fine, but I wanted someone who was sure about me. He agreed to stay in touch, but after that conversation, neither of us reached out again. It’s now been a month of no contact.

Mods, please feel free to remove if this isn’t allowed.

My husband’s getting drinks with a coworker and I’m terrified.

My husband (35M) and I (34F) have been together for nine years, married for five. He was showing me a video on his phone the other day and a text came through from a female name I didn’t recognize. I asked who it was and he said she’s a colleague from a company that his company works closely with. He has text previews turned off so I couldn’t actually see what was said but my suspicions were raised. 

I know it’s wrong but when he was in the shower that evening I looked through his phone to see who this girl is and why she’s texting him. I found out that they’ve been getting coffee and lunch during the workday, sometimes to talk about work, sometimes not. Prior to last week, it was maybe once a month communications to plan these, but then she joined a board that he’s on last week. So they had a board meeting and then seemed to go out as a group for drinks after until about 11. I did know that he was out with his colleagues during this time and wasn’t concerned. What is concerning is that he texted her that night making sure she got home safe and telling her how much fun he had but that he’d been hoping to have more opportunities to talk with her instead of everyone else. The next morning, he texted her good morning and asking her to drinks one on one next week. She agreed and he said he couldn’t wait.

Of course I looked her up and she’s a very beautiful woman, probably in her mid 20s.

I asked again later who she was and what their connection was. He reiterated that she’s a colleague and is helping get him connected with exciting opportunities in her organization. I know he’s been really focused on networking and she has a lot of high up community connections that it looks like she’s introduced him to. He’s also a friendly guy who likes to be involved, through board work and professional groups. I don’t want to go scorched earth and accuse him of anything inappropriate since my insecurity has been a major issue we’ve had to work through in the past but I’m terrified he’s going to cheat on me. Would this send off alarm bells for you and how would you respond without accusing him and ruining the marriage?",5,1737920459.0,relationship_advice,8,1.0,False

The other day, I went out with my girl friends and we all went shopping and he mentioned ""I wish you were out earlier"". Before I left home, he asked ""but what am I going to eat for dinner?""

I started dating a really sexy 20-year-old waitress there who was a student at Villanova University. I had a shitty little apartment that she would stay in some nights when she wasn’t living with her parents. We were both broke The manager of the restaurant was this guy named Jim, who was really cool but very ADD and never organized. Therefore, he began having me act as an assistant manager for him, including giving me a copy of the “manager’s card.” That card allowed me to do a lot of things, including removing items from customers bills from our system. My girlfriend and I already had a little thing going on where I made sure she got all high tipping tables in her section. For example, if two little old ladies came in to have dessert and coffee, they would be seated in the back of the restaurant. However, if four business guys in suits came in for steaks and drinks, I would make sure they were seated with her. Whenever she would have a table where there was a lot of drinking going on we would always add a 15% gratuity to their bill, without telling them, of course. She was gorgeous so when she would bring the bill over to the table, she would flirt with them and not give them a chance to really look at the bill too closely. On top of that whenever she would get a table that would pay with cash. I would take that manager’s card and delete that entire transaction from the system leaving us with all the cash. We were taking the place for over 2000 bucks a week for over a year. It ended when we went on a swinger cruise, had a great time and then broke up within a day of being home. She quit the Restaurant the next week and I never seen her again. I use that money to pay for my first year of law school in cash.",1,1737920344.0,confessions,0,0.67,False

1iao0gb,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1iao0gb/36m_in_a_longterm_relationship_having_doubts_and/,36m in a long-term relationship having doubts and simultaneously dealing with limerence,"I (36m) have been in a relationship with my partner (35m) for 14 years. We've had ups and downs throughout as any relationship however stuck it through (this is includes going through two short break-ups throughout the years). The past year hasn't been the greatest: tones of arguments and bickering at one another over the smallest of things, however we've always moved past them (in most him cases he moves on quicker than I do). As a result, since the end of the summer last of 2024, I've been having doubts about the relationship and questioning if it's time to leave. My biggest is issue is the lack of passion on my part towards him, and that spark and chemistry being gone for a long time. I would always look forward to any time alone, or even travelling alone. I struggle very much to answer the question of whether I love him or not but part of that could be due to a misrepresented definition I have of what love is. Despite that, we still do a lot of things together mostly because ""it's just the way it always has been"". 



Things got even more complicated in the Fall when I started chatting with a guy at my gym who I've hit it off well with. We've gone out for coffee once and we were both astonished at how much we have in common: similar family conflicts, both dealing with a parent with dementia, and for those who care we happened to be the exact same psychological sign which includes sun, moon and rising - again take what you will from that. We also discovered we have similar challenges in day-to-day life with things such as work conflict resolution, and just generally shared some similar opinions. I don't know for sure how he feels towards me, there have been mixed signals and to be fair he is the one who approached me at the gym to say hey. At the same time, I can tell he is trying to protect him self by limiting how often he will reach out since he knows I'm in a relationship. I get butterflies thinking about him and I can easily envision doing things I don't have the desire to do with my partner such as being very affectionate with him including in public. I feel like the only way I can do this with my partner is if we almost reconstruct many aspects of our relationship from scratch but my struggle is the lack of motivation to do this.



My issue is I find myself in such a confusing situation now where it's hard to focus on one thing (the relationship) or the crush (intense infatuation, and obsessing over them reaching out to me). I'm worried it will cause confusion in my decision on how to handle the relationship. My mind is already viewing the crush as a form of salvation and reward I get to have if I leave the relationship - but this is insane because as much as I connect with this person, there is still so much I do not know about him and it's still possible we may not be a match. 



My biggest worry is I end the relationship because of my silly but intense crush rather than because of core issues that I've deemed cannot be solved because we have grown apart too much (I have a therapist helping me with this bit and he is also aware of the crush). 



I just wanted to put this out here to see if anyone can relate and just to hear other perspectives that isn't from biased mind.

1ianxja,https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianTeachers/comments/1ianxja/im_thinking_about_starting_an_egan_school/,I'm thinking about starting an Egan School,"In late 2023 I read Brandon Hendrickson’s book review of Kieran Egan’s book *The Educated Mind* on ACX. I’m a teacher and it lit a fire in me. I spent 2024 cycling with my young family and while I kept reading some Egan-related things, I didn’t really “work on it”. At some point in that year I decided to dedicate a bunch of 2025 time (around 20 hours a week) to understanding Egan’s ideas and determine what I should do with them. The big dream is to be part of revolutionising education around the world. The next step is starting an Egan school.



I’m posting because I would like to get feedback on what people think about my school and my education ideas. To this end, I welcome any comments. Please be polite, but pull no punches. If you have any ideas of your own that you think should be included in any good school, let me know them too. If you’d like to leave feedback anonymously, use this [link](https://www.admonymous.co/chris_wintergreen).



**The problem:** I think of it as *soft edges*, which I mean as “there are things that you’re literally allowed to change about education, but because people (teachers, students, parents) are set in their ways, these changes happen in a small way at best, so progress is slow/nonexistent”. Which is to say that I don’t think anyone is doing anything wrong - teachers, school execs, students, parents, The Department, the curriculum folks.



**My solution:** tell people “we’re doing a different thing over here so if you want to work/attend/send your spawn at/to this school, you’ll do it this way”. This will snap them out of their local inadequate equilibrium and we can explore the landscape of educational possibilities a bit. I also not-so-secretly want this to succeed then make a template for how other people can do it easily and export it to the rest of the country/the world. As in, here’s the menu, Egan is set, but you can pick from the other options depending on what you want your school to be like and what people near you want. Here’s how to do the financial bits, the legal bits, the marketing bits, the enrollment bits, all the other bits. At the end of the day I want more variety, ie. actual options for parents. Except Egan. Everyone must eat their Egan. (I don’t really mean that, if someone wants not-Egan they should be able to have it.)



Even though the first idea was purely “make an Egan school”, I’m departing from that because I think it's not marketable/distinct enough in small city like mine and I have a bunch of other ideas (that you're welcome to tell me are bad/incompatible) that I think are obviously good.



The differences to a “normal” school: 

1. **Every lesson is Eganised.** Imaginative education is in the middle of everything. I’m also into Socratic Method teaching and I think they can both fit together, I just need to work out how. I love Michael Strong’s substack, I just need to cash it out in terms of what’s happening in the classroom. I’m also into a very limited selection of Building Thinking Classrooms, partly because I think Egan/Socratic solves a bunch of that stuff already, partly because no direct instruction is madness.
2. **Subjects aren’t Maths/English/HASS/Science.** The world isn’t broken into those categories, so why would learning best be thought of that way? Thinking certainly isn’t. Instead we have fun things like Defence Against the Dark Arts (of manipulation, eg. sportsbetting, marketing), Reality Levels 1, 2, etc. (think like material science for things we interact with and physics/chem/bio come into it that way), Tool Use (think Conrad Wolfram’s maths curriculum that focuses less on the Calculate step of solving problems mathematically and more on the preceding Define and Abstract steps and the following Interpret step), Thinking (rationality, probably a bunch of stuff based on LW posts), Progress (Kinda progress studies, but also goes into the past, something something, grokking the arc of history and realising we’re living in it). There will also be subjects like Math Appreciation (probably compulsory) and Math Theory for people that like and want to do maths. And yes, I do kinda think that going to school should feel like going to Hogwarts - if kids learnt how things actually work in the real world, it would basically feel like magic anyway!
3. **TECH!** LLMs are a crazy tool to have access to! Each kid will be taught to be good at using them. They will have a context document and train their own LLM on their interests, their way of understanding so that every explanation is tailored to them. Assessment might be they use Sonnet/4o/r1 to learn about a topic (1 hour) then have a 10 minute teacher/class discussion about it, teaching the “teacher” (I like to think of us as “facilitators”). They will know how to make the LLM use Egan’s tools/Socratic Method to tell them stories and ask them (the student) questions to give them understanding, not information.
4. **There is (limited) self-directed inquiry (SDI).** This is less “study what you want” more “I will make you explore the world”. Super smart and wise kids I know have done free-for-all SDI (eg. Big Picture) and said it was mostly a waste of time because they couldn’t predict what they would be interested in even six months hence, let alone in a few years time. So for us, each project will be a term in duration. They will concurrently do things in a few categories:
   1. **Skill junkie:** you will end up with a box ticked on a report and maybe something on your resume after each of these. Think touch typing, make the perfect barista coffee, video editing, three-plate carry, quick sketching, spreadsheets.
   2. **What you want:** go deep on anything you want. 
   3. **Interesting part of a category.** Imagine a non-music person being forced to find the most interesting thing to them in music production and spending 30 hours working on it or a nerd doing woodwork. We make them do it because it’ll be good for them to be broad, not because it’s necessarily what they would choose to do right now. We will spend time getting them on board with this plan by explaining it rather than holding a whip. 
   4. **Exploration:** I’m into spending 90% of learning time going deep and 10% exploring, so they must explore.
5. **Things aren’t age based.** After an intro period to get the core stuff (focus, agency, confidence, LLM use, the culture) down, they are working at their level. [Templestowe College](https://tc.vic.edu.au/learning) does this and it seems great. I’m not super sure about this as I think it logistically works better for bigger schools (500+) and I don’t think I want these to be big schools.
6. **“After school program”.** The idea here is that from an early finish time (between 2pm and 2:30pm) until about 5pm there are things to do at school. At the start of that time they’d tend to be more organised and towards the end they’d be more “hang out”. This is not school because I want this to be a relatively independent time for the kids, kind of like forcing them to hang out in person rather than be on their phones the whole time. Also, it means parents can work a full day. Also, I don’t know how this fits with school buses - maybe cheaper because it’s off peak times, probably more expensive because it’s later and nobody else is doing it then. 
7. **Mentorship.** I haven’t thought about this one a lot yet because I know there are hundreds of successful mentorship programs in the world and I figure I can learn from them. I think everyone has and is a student mentor and the oldest kids have an external mentor, but we’ll see how it plays out.
8. **PE** isn’t about *learning sports,* it’s about learning how your body works, being in the right zone throughout the school day and having good habits when you leave school (eg. actually enjoying sport and therefore playing it, playing with friends, etc.)
9. **The kids coming out are functional humans.** For example, they should all be able to cook at least seven cheap, healthy, delicious meals. When they need to apply for a job/business number/university course they know how to use a language model to optimise that process and will five minute rule/more dakka until things get done. They will have *good habits*. (This is the goal anyway, shit will hit the fan as soon as kids get involved, it always does).



**Experiments**

I can test Egan/Socratic teaching and LLM use this year as a regular high school teacher. My viewpoint is that this isn’t really a science experiment because I’m just one teacher trying out some stuff, so I’m not going to pretend that it is. I just want to get an idea of if I think these things work and I want that idea to be as accurate as possible. If someone thinks they know how I could actually measure things at the start and the end (beyond a test of what they know or how they think they think), and disentangle the difference from what would have happened with an alternative 40 weeks for the kids, I’d love to hear it. Possibly I’d be picking three or four behaviours I’d like to see (eg. when someone gets stuck on a problem do they start trying effective strategies to solve it, kids can answer questions on adjacent topics because they understand rather than know) and get someone to observe at the start and end of the year. 



**I must confess**

I live in the real world as much as possible. My estimate of the base rate of people who want to start schools actually doing it is low. But everyone who *does* start a school, *has a plan and some belief that it might happen.* I’m trying to do the things that a smart person who starts a great school would do. Can a medium INT player play a high INT character? With help from some high INT players, maybe?

I am 32 Male Makati & BGC Area.

Do you know the words ""its easier to be lonely alone"". I have friends, family - but apparently I can't seem to connect. 

Hold up, this isn't a sadboi post. 

And its hard making friends online. you need commitment to stay in a friendship circle. And don't start me with dating.

So I am opening myself up here. Can be SFW can be not. we can decide later on.

I am:  
 \- not ghosting you, i might have forgotten to message because of my erratic day  
 \- loves talking in chat, but cant have a conversation on a call  
 \- can be NSFW, but passionate. Foreplays > Sex  
 \- Smallboi - maybe Im compensating.   
 \- Busy  
 \- Semi-active lifestyle  
 \- can manage myself  
 \- cant host  
 \- can receive trauma dump  
 \- dont care if you're in a relationship

  
You:  
 \- Girl / Trans  
 \- have a career  
 \- just want to talk to people too  
 \- coffee > beer  
 \- would rather have a conversation through chat than through a call  
 \- in a relationship / single - its okay  
 

Basically, I want a friend I can be anonymous with. I can make landi with. but not one night stand.

I have telegram, we can chat and move there when we get comfortable with each other.

I'm no judge, so won't be bothered if you have any issues in life. trauma dump me if you want.",1,1737919604.0,r4rphilippines,0,1.0,False

Imagine a vast ocean filled with digital riches, where whales—massive movers of Bitcoin—glide effortlessly through the blockchain waters. But even these majestic creatures sometimes find themselves stuck in the murky depths of slow transactions. That’s where **Bitcoin Jumper**, our premium Bitcoin transaction accelerator, comes in to save the day. 🌊🐋

Dive in as we explore the thrilling world of Bitcoin whales, their epic transactions, and how Bitcoin Jumper ensures their crypto journeys stay smooth and speedy.

# Chapter 1: Meet the Bitcoin Whales

Bitcoin whales aren’t mythical creatures, but they might as well be with the waves they create in the crypto market. These are individuals or entities holding a vast amount of Bitcoin—typically thousands of BTC. In the blockchain ecosystem, their moves can make ripples that affect everyone from casual HODLers to hardcore traders.

# Why Are They Called Whales?

Much like whales in the ocean, these Bitcoin holders dominate their ecosystem. Their massive transactions have the power to:

* Influence market prices.
* Trigger trends (or FOMO).
* Stall transaction times by clogging the blockchain.

When a whale moves, the entire crypto community takes notice.

# Chapter 2: The Problem with Slow Transactions

For all its revolutionary power, Bitcoin isn’t without flaws. One of the most frustrating? Slow transaction speeds during times of network congestion.

Picture this:

* A whale decides to move 5,000 BTC to a new wallet.
* The network gets flooded with transactions.
* Miners prioritize high-fee transactions, leaving smaller, lower-fee ones (and sometimes even the whale’s!) stuck in limbo.

For whales, time is money—literally. Delayed transactions can mean missed opportunities or, worse, financial losses.

# Chapter 3: Enter Bitcoin Jumper—The Blockchain Lifeboat

That’s where **Bitcoin Jumper** steps in, like a trusty speedboat cutting through blockchain traffic. 🚤 Our premium Bitcoin transaction accelerator ensures that whether you’re a whale or a minnow, your transactions move swiftly and smoothly.

# How Bitcoin Jumper Works

Think of Bitcoin Jumper as your VIP pass to the blockchain. Here’s how it makes magic happen:

1. **Transaction Priority**: We work with miners to prioritize your transaction in the next available block.
2. **Global Coverage**: Wherever you are, Bitcoin Jumper is there to help.
3. **Ease of Use**: All it takes is a simple transaction ID. Enter it on [Bitcoin Jumper](https://www.bitcoinjumper.com), and you’re good to go.

No more waiting hours—or days—for confirmations.

# Chapter 4: Whales + Bitcoin Jumper = Perfect Match

For Bitcoin whales, speed and reliability are non-negotiable. With Bitcoin Jumper, they get exactly that.

# Why Whales Love Bitcoin Jumper

# Chapter 5: Whale Watching—Famous Moves in Bitcoin History

Some whale transactions have gone down in crypto folklore. Let’s take a moment to appreciate these epic splashes:

# 1. The Early Adopter Splash

In 2010, one of Bitcoin’s earliest whales made waves by mining thousands of BTC when it was worth less than a cent. Fast forward to today, and they’re sitting on a digital treasure chest worth billions.

# 2. The Mysterious Wallet Moves

Have you ever seen headlines about hundreds of millions in BTC moving from dormant wallets? Whales often shift their funds to new addresses for security or strategic reasons.

# 3. Elon’s Tweet-Triggered Tides

While not a whale in the traditional sense, Elon Musk’s tweets have caused Bitcoin markets to churn like a stormy sea. Whales often capitalize on these moments, making massive trades.

# Chapter 6: Tips for Aspiring Whales

Not everyone starts as a whale, but with patience, strategy, and a little help from tools like Bitcoin Jumper, you can swim with the big fish someday.

# 1. HODL Like a Pro

Patience is key. Whales are known for holding their Bitcoin during market dips and cashing out during peaks.

I like to go for a good 30-60 minute walk outside in the summer everyday but I want to be able to get close to 10k steps a day with regular daily movement (if possible) without adding a 30-60 minute treadmill walk- if it’s days that I’m home without errands (I only work 3 days a week and can typically get close to or reach it from going for short walks in my work building) I struggle to get anywhere close to 7500 let alone 10K. 

I go for my summer walks because I like them not for the added increase in my step count- I naturally have a higher step count in the summer due to the activities I have in my life in the summer and I will park further away, walk to get coffee, etc rather than driving everywhere or seasonally sitting on my couch hibernating.

# Tata Motors Breaks Ground with Hydrogen Truck Pilot in India

Tata Motors is embarking on a pioneering journey with the rollout of India’s first hydrogen-powered trucks, in collaboration with Indian Oil Corporation (IOC). This project is part of the [National Green Hydrogen Mission](https://worldmagzine.com/world/world-bank-approves-1-5-billion-loan-to-boost-indias-green-hydrogen-push/) and will focus on exploring the feasibility of hydrogen fuel in the transport sector. The pilot program will run for 12-18 months across prominent routes like Jamshedpur-Kalinganagar, Mumbai-Ahmedabad, and Mumbai-Pune.

The fleet of trucks will utilize hydrogen internal combustion engines (H2ICE), an eco-friendly alternative to conventional fuels. IOC will play a crucial role in setting up the refueling infrastructure required to make hydrogen-powered trucking a viable option in India. Tata Motors aims to collect data to assess hydrogen’s commercial potential for long-distance hauls and refueling station logistics.

At the Bharat Mobility [Global Expo ](https://worldmagzine.com/technology/u-s-ai-chip-export-rules-spark-industry-backlash-over-competitiveness-concerns/)2025, Tata Motors also revealed the Tata Prima H.28, India’s first commercial vehicle with a hydrogen engine, boasting a 550-kilometer range. This hydrogen-powered vehicle is a key milestone in Tata’s push towards sustainable transportation, with hydrogen seen as a future alternative to traditional fuels like diesel and CNG.

Despite recent challenges in the commercial vehicle market, Tata Motors remains optimistic about recovery. With sales expected to bounce back in FY26, Tata Motors sees the ongoing hydrogen pilot as a critical step in securing a greener future for India’s transport industry.

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea or coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least **once** per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to be a problem, then I am not the right writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the actual roleplay is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me about a roleplayer is that I always, in a manner of speaking, come empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything within the story, be it the plot, the characters, the lore, the entire world they're in, and pretty much everything else **together** with my writing partner! The main exception to that rule are mainly monsters and some other fantastical creatures, that I may, or may not outright steal from mythology, video games, DnD or other sorts of fiction! This isn't a perfect approach, and definitely not an approach that would work for everyone. Still, I do not believe in perfect, and that is what works for me!

Which also means that, no, I will not be very interested if you already have an intricate plot or world of your own. If you do, I wish you the absolute best with it, but that's just not what I am looking for!

Now, I have mentioned that I want to write a story in an urban fantasy... but what *is* urban fantasy to me?

Simple! By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, *how* advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I should mention that at least at the moment, I *really* do not want to write a medieval fantasy. I've already got one, and I'm not really hungry for more!

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings. Things such as swordsmen cutting through modern armed soldiers by the dozens, dodging and parrying of actual bullets, and characters that fight on in spite of grievous injuries are all par of the course! So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

Now, as for the characters! I have already mentioned my love for ensemble casts, and for this reason, the ability to create characters that differ by age\*, gender, romantic orientation, social background, moral alignment, and more, is absolutely essential! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! When it comes to my lead character in particular, we'll see. The only thing that's certain is that she'll be a woman. I also, generally speaking, prefer to write characters from their late 20s to their mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't necessarily off the table, I cannot promise I can be convinced to go down that road!

\*That said, most of the cast should be at least 21+ of age, if not 25+ outright.

As for romance, while I have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, I still prefer writing partners willing and able to write all three basic gender combinations. By that I mean, obviously, FxM, MxM, and of course, FxF! Why? That's simple! I love variety, and I don't find it particularly realistic, nor immersive, when it's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

That said, while I do not outright require that our lead characters have to be romantically involved, I really am not the partner for you if you dislike writing romance in general.

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! I typically tend to take my time rather than answer the very first person that messages me. What I do want to know is how I may call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete, so don't worry, I am not asking for much! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I do typically prefer to stay here, before actually moving on. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

Sooo... this is everything!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! I typically tend to take my time rather than answer the very first person that messages me. What I do want to know is how I may call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete, so don't worry, I am not asking for much! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I do typically prefer to stay here, before actually moving on. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

Sooo... this is everything!

1ianf1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1ianf1p/today_has_been_difficult/,Today has been difficult,"It’s been 7 months since the breakup and I was doing better these last couple of months and have really worked on myself. But it’s my ex’s birthday today. I so wanted to reach out to her just to send her a short and friendly birthday message, but 5 days ago, out of nowhere, she either deleted my number altogether or blocked me on WhatsApp, and that hasn’t changed since. Either way, it’s a sign that she never wants to hear from me or have anything to do with me again. We haven’t been in any sort of contact for 6 and a half months anyway, so it seems like a deliberate move. Tonight I’ll be deleting her number, which breaks my heart all over again. 

A part of me really believed she would reach out again after she’d gone and dealt with whatever ‘mental health struggles’ she was dealing with 7 months ago and I would’ve happily waited for her because I loved her. I tried my best to fight for her, which probably pushed her further away, and I would’ve done absolutely ANYTHING to make the relationship work. I always imagined she would reach out and we’d have a coffee and talk about each others’ progress and maybe start over, both coming from healthier and improved situations. We would’ve had better communication and expressed our wants and needs. 

She was my first love and the person I truly thought I’d spend the rest of my life with. Now I realise I was foolish for believing she might want to at least just be friends. She never had any intention of it - she said she couldn’t say if the breakup was permanent but she didn’t want to ask me to wait. But I waited just the same. I waited for 7 months and I would’ve waited even longer.

Seeing she’s either blocked or deleted me completely out of nowhere is just confirmation that she has in fact simply moved on like the I was nothing and like our relationship was nothing. That was already after ending things in such a cold and dismissive manner. I think that hope and her refusal to give me finality to make things easier for herself has caused me unnecessary added pain. What was the point? What was the point of it all?

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea or coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least **once** per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to be a problem, then I am not the right writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the actual roleplay is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me about a roleplayer is that I always, in a manner of speaking, come empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything within the story, be it the plot, the characters, the lore, the entire world they're in, and pretty much everything else **together** with my writing partner! The main exception to that rule are mainly monsters and some other fantastical creatures, that I may, or may not outright steal from mythology, video games, DnD or other sorts of fiction! This isn't a perfect approach, and definitely not an approach that would work for everyone. Still, I do not believe in perfect, and that is what works for me!

Which also means that, no, I will not be very interested if you already have an intricate plot or world of your own. If you do, I wish you the absolute best with it, but that's just not what I am looking for!

Now, I have mentioned that I want to write a story in an urban fantasy... but what *is* urban fantasy to me?

Simple! By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, *how* advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I should mention that at least at the moment, I *really* do not want to write a medieval fantasy. I've already got one, and I'm not really hungry for more!

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings. Things such as swordsmen cutting through modern armed soldiers by the dozens, dodging and parrying of actual bullets, and characters that fight on in spite of grievous injuries are all par of the course! So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

Now, as for the characters! I have already mentioned my love for ensemble casts, and for this reason, the ability to create characters that differ by age\*, gender, romantic orientation, social background, moral alignment, and more, is absolutely essential! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! When it comes to my lead character in particular, we'll see. The only thing that's certain is that she'll be a woman. I also, generally speaking, prefer to write characters from their late 20s to their mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't necessarily off the table, I cannot promise I can be convinced to go down that road!

\*That said, most of the cast should be at least 21+ of age, if not 25+ outright.

As for romance, while I have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, I still prefer writing partners willing and able to write all three basic gender combinations. By that I mean, obviously, FxM, MxM, and of course, FxF! Why? That's simple! I love variety, and I don't find it particularly realistic, nor immersive, when it's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

That said, while I do not outright require that our lead characters have to be romantically involved, I really am not the partner for you if you dislike writing romance in general.

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment

My phone had been dead for hours, my stomach was hollow, and my legs felt like lead after miles of walking. When I saw the semi’s headlights break through the storm, I didn’t think. I ran into the middle of the road, waving my arms like a lunatic.

The truck screeched to a stop, the hiss of air brakes slicing through the rain. For a moment, it just sat there, looming over me. I couldn’t see the driver through the rain-streaked windshield, but I felt his eyes. The cab door creaked open, and a man leaned out, his face shadowed by a damp baseball cap.

“You need a ride?” His voice was deep, measured.

I hesitated. Something about him made the hair on my neck stand up. He was huge—easily over six feet—and his shoulders filled the doorway. But the rain was freezing, and the road was empty.

“Yeah,” I said, climbing into the cab.

The door slammed shut behind me, cutting off the sound of the storm. The cab was warm but cramped, the dashboard cluttered with old receipts and empty coffee cups. The smell of leather and sweat hung heavy in the air.

“Where you headed?” he asked, putting the truck in gear.

“Anywhere west,” I said, keeping my voice steady.

He nodded but didn’t say anything else. His hands gripped the wheel, massive and rough, the knuckles nicked and scarred. I couldn’t stop staring at them.

“I’m Bill,” he said after a long silence, his eyes fixed on the road.

“Cassie.”

He glanced at me, his face unreadable in the dim light of the dashboard. His eyes lingered a moment too long.

The rain hammered against the windshield as we drove. He didn’t turn on the radio, didn’t make small talk. Just drove, his gaze fixed dead ahead, his expression blank. I tried to relax, but something about the way he gripped the wheel—tight, almost angry—made my stomach twist.

“You been walking a while?” he asked suddenly, his voice breaking the silence.

“Yeah,” I said, forcing a laugh. “Got caught in the storm.”

He nodded but didn’t look at me.

Minutes stretched into an hour, the silence heavy and oppressive. I tried to focus on the rain, the steady rhythm of the wipers, but my nerves were frayed. He hadn’t said a word since that one question, and I could feel his eyes flicking toward me every few minutes.

“You remind me of someone,” he said abruptly.

My stomach dropped.

“Oh? Who?” I asked, keeping my tone light.

“My sister,” he said.

I forced a smile. “That’s nice.”

He didn’t respond. Just kept driving.

The truck slowed suddenly, veering off the highway onto a narrow dirt road. My pulse spiked.

“Where are we going?”

“Shortcut,” he said, his tone flat.

The trees closed in on either side of the truck, the road so narrow it felt like the branches were scraping against the windows. The headlights barely cut through the darkness, and I couldn’t see anything but the narrow strip of road ahead.

“You sure this is a shortcut?” I asked, my voice trembling.

“Yeah.”

He didn’t elaborate.

I gripped the edge of my seat, my breath coming faster. I glanced at the door handle, wondering if I could survive the jump.

“Don’t.”

His voice was quiet, almost gentle, but it sent a chill down my spine.

“You jump out here, you’ll die in those woods,” he said. “Ain’t nothing out there but trees and coyotes.”

The truck came to a stop in a small clearing. He turned off the engine, and the silence was deafening.

“Why are we stopping?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

He didn’t answer.

He reached for something under his seat. I froze, my heart hammering in my chest. A knife? A gun?

“Here,” he said, pulling out a sandwich wrapped in plastic.

I stared at it, my mind racing.

“You hungry?” he asked.

I nodded, my hands shaking as I took it. I didn’t want to eat it. I didn’t trust it. But I couldn’t say no.

He watched me as I unwrapped it, his dark eyes unreadable.

“You remind me of her,” he said again, his voice softer this time.

“Your sister?” I asked, trying to keep him talking, keep him calm.

He nodded, his jaw tight.

“She left me,” he said. “Didn’t even say goodbye.”

“I’m sorry,” I said, my voice trembling.

He looked at me, really looked at me, and I felt like I couldn’t breathe.

“You’re different,” he said, almost to himself.

“Different how?” I asked, my throat dry.

“You don’t lie,” he said. “Not like the others.”

I had no idea what he meant, but I nodded, my fingers clutching the sandwich like a lifeline.

He sat back, his shoulders slumping. For a moment, he looked tired. Human.

Then he reached into his pocket.

My breath caught.

He pulled out a small silver locket, the metal tarnished with age.

“She gave me this,” he said, holding it out to me.

I stared at it, unsure if I should take it.

“She’d want you to have it,” he said.

I took it, my fingers brushing against his hand. His skin was ice cold.

“Get out,” he said suddenly, his voice sharp.

“What?”

“Get out of the truck,” he said, his eyes fixed on the windshield.

I didn’t move.

“Go!” he barked, his voice thunderous.

I fumbled with the door, scrambling out into the clearing. The rain had stopped, but the air was still damp and heavy.

He leaned across the seat, staring at me through the open door.

“Don’t look back,” he said.

I didn’t.

I ran, clutching the locket so tightly it dug into my palm. I didn’t stop until I hit the highway, my chest heaving, my legs trembling.

A car finally stopped, and I climbed in, sobbing as I told them what had happened.

The police searched the woods, but they didn’t find anything. No truck. No clearing. No Bill.

Sometimes, I wonder if he really let me go—or if he’s still out there, waiting for someone else to remind him of his sister.",5,1737918232.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

1ian0sk,https://i.redd.it/7oqr5ovpydfe1.jpeg,I think this kitchen sink was a big mistake,"We finally finished our remodel and I really like the look.  Unfortunately I hate cleaning this thing.  If you peel a carrot all the peels get tangled up in the rack.  It’s flat on the bottom and after rinsing plates I have to chase the food detritus around the sink to get it to go down the disposal.  The straight edges & corners collect grime and the underside of the rack attracts grease which in turn collects crud and coffee grounds - at least once a week it wants me to use a pile of Barkeepers Friend and a half hour of detail cleaning in the corners with various implements. 

TLDR it’s pretty but it gets gross fast and is a giant pain to clean.  

Mainly I’m venting but cleaning shortcut suggestions would be most welcome - I don’t think I’ll be ripping it out and replacing it, but if you’re considering this shape (under mount very square edges with a rack) - I suggest picking something with smooth edges and rounded corners unless scouring your kitchen sink brings you joy.

I'm by no means an espresso connoisseur, but the taste of the lattes have been good imo, and I'm excited to start using the grinder once I get though the pre-ground bags I already have.
I've also been struggling with latte art. I'm using the automatic milk frother setting on the machine, so I'm sure that's not helping. However, at the end of the day, the cups I've made have been delicious. I'd be interested to hear from anyone that has a bambino plus and has made lovely latte art (tips and tricks, etc.).

1iamt4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1iamt4y/my_honest_review_of_the_bellucci_aroma_a/,My Honest Review of the Bellucci Aroma: A Disappointing Experience,"Hello coffee enthusiasts,

I wanted to share my experience with the Bellucci Aroma, a semi-automatic espresso machine I recently purchased, along with the Bellucci Casa coffee grinder. As someone who has always loved espresso and worked in coffee shops, restaurants, and bars during my student years, I’ve developed a deep appreciation for the craft of making a good coffee.

Back then, in the early 2000s (no YouTube channel or Reddit!), espresso methodology was still relatively unknown, at least in Eastern Canada. Fast forward to today: my not so beloved Seaco Minuto automatic espresso machine (that I got as a student gift for my sleepless study nights) recently gave up after many years of loyal service. I decided it was time to go back to basics with a manual machine to rekindle the joy of making espresso myself.

On a whim, I purchased the Bellucci Aroma and Casa grinder, which were on sale with an enticing 35% discount (total pricing at about 450$ CAD). After learning about the history of the Bellucci brand—its focus on Italian-inspired design—I had high hopes that their products would deliver a premium coffee experience. Unfortunately, despite the discount and my initial excitement, my experience has been far from satisfying.

What I Liked:

**Aesthetics and Design:**

Personnaly, I think the Bellucci Aroma look beautiful, has a sleek design that looks great on my coffee table. I was excited when I first unboxed it as the reviews about this machine was extremely positive

**Customer Service Response Time:**

Bellucci’s customer service team was polite and quick to respond to my inquiries. However, as I’ll explain, their solutions left a lot to be desired.

The Disappointments:

**Unique Portafilter Design:**

The Aroma features a proprietary 51mm portafilter design with non-standard ears, which makes it incompatible with most third-party accessories. While this exclusivity might aim to ensure a snug fit and optimized performance, it ultimately limits the user’s ability to upgrade or personalize their setup. For example, finding a bottomless portafilter or higher-quality baskets is nearly impossible unless sourced directly from Bellucci—which are not available. This unique design, unfortunately, feels more restrictive than beneficial, especially for users looking to refine their espresso-making process. 

**Limited Filter Options:**

Again, the portafilter is exclusive to Bellucci, which also means I can’t find higher-quality precision filters or baskets from other manufacturers. This limits any opportunity to improve the performance or versatility of the machine.

**Pressure Gauge Issues:**

The built-in pressure gauge lacks clear indicators in BAR or PSI. Instead, you’re left to rely on vague green and red zones, which aren’t helpful for achieving consistent and precise espresso extractions. At least show me where the 8 BAR point is... 

**Excessive Noise:**

The machine is very loud during operation—far noisier than I expected. This makes me wonder if my unit might be defective. I reached out to Bellucci regarding this issue, but unfortunately, they have yet to provide any actionable solution or concrete guidance to address my concerns.

**Customer Service Shortcomings:**

Although customer service responded quickly, their answers were underwhelming. For example, when I asked about purchasing a compatible bottomless portafilter, I was referred to a vague link on Temu, which isn’t the kind of support I expect from a company of Bellucci’s caliber.

**Regret About My Purchase:**

In hindsight, I regret not opting for Bellucci’s Espresso Bar model or considering other machines like the popular Bambino or even the Lelit Anna. These machines seem to align much better with my needs, offering the flexibility and features I was hoping for. The Aroma, on the other hand, feels like an entry-level machine with hidden limitations, and as someone looking to elevate their espresso experience, I find myself constrained and unable to fully enjoy the process. **I understand that I got what I paid for, I really do, but it leaves a bitter taste knowing I’m now stuck with it.** 

**Why I Made This Purchase**

I purchased the Bellucci Aroma and Casa grinder because I wanted to reconnect with the hands-on process of making espresso. The discount of 35% off made the purchase even more tempting. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met, and I feel stuck with a machine that doesn’t allow me to enjoy the full potential of manual espresso-making.

**Final Thoughts**

The return or exchange policy at Bellucci is **very** strict, so I know that an exchange might not be possible. However, if I had the opportunity to make a switch, even if it meant incurring additional costs on my side, I would likely choose the Espresso Bar model. It seems to offer the flexibility and features that better align with what I’m looking for in a machine.

That being said, I can’t help but wonder if even with the Espresso Bar model, I might encounter similar frustrations with compatibility and accessory limitations.

I’m reaching out to this community to ask for your advice: Are there any solutions or workarounds that could help me improve my experience with the Aroma? Have any of you faced similar issues and found ways to address them? Any insights you can share would be greatly appreciated.",1,1737917619.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

Ever since I married my wife she has always told me she has college degrees from high elite  colleges and so on. I always thought it was cool at first but recently now when I question her about it like the proof of degrees or framed diplomas she says that’s not recommended. I beg to differ. I’m a college grad and have my proof because I worked for it. She says I’m judging her and that I shouldn’t question her educational background. My thing is this. If I went to school and achieved a MBA and Bachelors like she says she has then I would be proud and show it off. 

 Give me some feedback. Should I let it go or just is something not adding up like I think already. It makes sense why she won’t pursue better jobs and stays with coffee shops fml lol",1,1737917503.0,Marriage,5,1.0,False

Now I know this is a both an extremely silly and gross issue to outsiders, but I’m begging you all for some empathy and patience…. I figured this community over others would help me with this problem without laughing at me, and also understanding the delicate situation I’m in with being newly engaged. (I’m waiting on the ring too, but he got down on one knee recently and that means enough for me.) [see, this is also why I need to handle this with so much grace!! What if tonight’s the night I get the ring and I’m busy talking to him about this… AGAIN lol] 

Back on track. My fiancée is wonderful. He’s my soulmate, and I’m so happy I found LD a few years ago or I don’t think we would’ve made it.  (I am 27F, he’s 26M.) 
We’ve been working through a lot of things lately, and are even getting along and spending time together more and more lately. He has ADHD and a lot on his plate, and is the sole provider in our relationship, so I make it a point to not his little things and habits ruin my day/his evening home from work. I have relinquished control on so many little things that past me would’ve frothed at the mouth and screamed for hours about. (I wish I could go back in time and grab myself and say Honey it’s okay… they’re just dirty dishes! It’s okay!!!!) 

Backstory over—-
We have been together for 7 years. During the first few years when he was in college, I noticed he had a habit of rubbing his nose on his pillow at night when it was itchy, but didn’t think much of it and thought it was pretty cute. 
Now as we’ve gotten comfortable and into our own marital home, he’s loosened up and I see a lot more of the comfortable habits I imagine he’s grown up with. 

What I’m trying to say is he picks his nose and then wipes his boogers on our bedsheets. And this isn’t just a once in awhile thing, it’s an every single day thing. I sleep on top of our comforter most of the time and he, under it (it gets hot at night) and when I would strip the bed before I knew he did this, there would be PILES of them in spots. 
Our bedsheets are ripped at the corners (I’ve mended them twice now, they keep ripping probably from the repetitive motion of him grabbing the bedsheets and wiping his hands in them for the last few years) and where there’s the gap in them, I imagine they get through, and there’ll be little crusty pile ups of boogers in the little crevices of the mattress.

It’s so hard. I love him dearly, I don’t want to be his mother and nag him, and I tell myself he does so much for me. 
But lately I’ve been struggling with my skin health and I’m realizing I (and he likely, he’s always itching this spot on his leg) may have a staph infection, [I have a medical background before I became SAHW] and where do you get a lot of that bacteria? That’s right, the nose. :( 

I’ve tried approaching him gently and softly, very conscious this was a very embarrassing and delicate situation. I insisted I wasn’t angry but it was something I noticed. I was vulnerable but gently and firm and said it was not okay. He says he won’t do it anymore. 
Maybe a day or two will pass, but before I know it I’m lifting the pillows to make the bed and the sheets are all torn off on his side, with dry boogers smeared all over chaotically, the worst part is I know I can’t get every bit of it with a tissue, and that the little particles are floating around in the bed, waiting for him to crawl back into, then try to in the morning to be intimate and sweet with me, and it’s sooo hard to be sweet when all I can think about is how his booger particles could be getting into my freshly waxed skin again, if they’re not already there.  


I tried many times after the initial first gentle confrontations doing it in a joking way, teasing him. When I had the millionth talk about it in the autumn last year, I even called him booger boy in a cute saucy way (I promise in context it was cute and diffused what was a really awkward and probably embarrassing situation for him)  and was vulnerable with him and confessed one of my disgusting hygiene sins that I gave up when I realized I wouldn’t want to have him see me do it, and also it was just plain unhygienic and not an  okay way to live. 
I said every human has their gross habits, but it’s up to us to choose to overcome them or make new habits. We cried in each others arms and I apologized for flipping out and flipped my lid over it. 
Then again, a few days later, we’re back to it. 
I want to strip the bed and wash the sheets with super hot water every time I find them. It’s beyond frustrating and just feels cruel to me after I’ve tried so many times to ask him so many different ways not to do it, when I’ve explained that I want to not worry about boogers in my hair or in our marital bed… 

And now after finding out about this staph thing my heart is just sinking. I need to, WE absolutely NEED, a sanitary place to sleep.
Our guest bedroom is my office, so him being demoted to the couch (lol) isn’t an option. I’d rather not spend all my off time waking and sleeping hours in my office, so that’s not an ideal option. Besides, since we’re so freshly engaged, I’d realllllllyyy rather not go back to sleeping in different beds over something as petty to him this. 

He struggles to get out of bed in the morning, and honestly, I think he stays in bed for awhile after I leave to start coffee/making his lunch so that way he can DO his daily boogie ritual (lol). I’ve come in and surprised him mid wipe. I mean… he’s comfortable enough to do it right next to me. I called him out in it before last year every time I say it during one of my not-as-good spells, and it would always turn into “NO! I’m just ITCHING my nose!” (Lying) or “honey PLEAASEE” (one of my pet peeves) 

I’ve tried so many ways of approaching this. A week ago when I exploded when he told me to stop washing the bedsheets since I just had done it, and I snapped back I needed to because it was covered in boogers again, and broke down crying after that and explained it just feels so purposeful at this point that he still does it. I fibbed and told him I posted on Reddit and asked for help (in reality I found a slightly similar issue that I quoted from) and someone said to that OP that their son does similar and wipes it on their walls, so she asked him to wipe it on his boxers or socks instead. 
WELL, he’s taken that to mean “wipe it on the boxers that I’m wearing” (he wipes his hands on his clothes a lot so I can see the habit, I don’t nag him about it, it’s not on my paper) and now just wipes it under his pillow as usual, or picks his nose and then sticks his hand back under the covers to rub them on his boxers, then go back to trying to put said hand on my face. 

Please, please, please; I’m so desperate for advice and help. Since we just got engaged a couple weeks ago, I really don’t  want to tip over the boat and cause his resentment to build up for me, to make him have to pursue more self care because I can’t handle this conversation and I blow up, and then to delay me getting the ring I’ve dreamed of for years and to tell the world we’re officially engaged… :( selfish I know but I’m speaking from my heart 

My friends just laugh or are disgusted by this issue. 
I promise you I’ve done all the normal, obvious stuff. I’m prone to runny noses (and tears lol) in general, there is a box of tissues on each side of the bed and every single room in the house. I also want to get more hand sanitizer bottles and put them right next to them… :(  I’ve said this exact thing so many different ways so many times: 
I don’t care if you’re going to pick your nose , just wipe it on the tissues that are right next to the bed, and throw them on the floor, I’ll get them in the morning, same as I do my own! I love you !

Do I tell him about the Staph infection worries? Should I just keep trying to gently talk to him? I was taking a picture in bed each day of them just for proof to myself because he would deny it. I never showed him them, and at first, I was going to make a big gross collage and show him like no honey this is what I have to do each day—but I realized that’s complete psycho behavior lol. I just am at my wits end. 
We’re talking about trying for a baby after we’re married, and it’s such a dream, but I also just cannot fathom the father of my children allowing me and his babies to live and sleep in filth :( 

I can see that in a way I’m trying to change his behavior, but I think this is a situation LD would understand.. r-right? I’ve tried SFPs. I thanked him for cleaning up after himself even when he wasn’t. Do I just keep doing it ?? :( I’m desperate for anyone who’s had a similar situation to weigh in 

Please please help. I’ve meditated, I’ve prayed, I’ve read, I’ve relinquished control, but now as I realize I need to stand firm for not just myself but also my family’s health…
 I am turning to my community for help.

I wasn’t exactly dressed to impress—bed hair, a crumpled shirt, and a general ""I-need-coffee"" vibe. We ended up at a clothing store, and while my energy levels were at rock bottom, my wandering eyes spotted a pretty girl walking in with her younger brother and what I assumed was her mom.

Naturally, as any normal human would, I spent the next few minutes lowkey (okay, highkey) thinking, Wow, she’s cute. Mind you, I was doing absolutely nothing to look like a functional human, let alone someone you’d want to strike up a conversation with.

Anyway, as we shuffled through the aisles, she suddenly walked up to us. For a split second, my brain panicked like, What do I say?! What do I do?! Why didn’t I fix my hair?! But before I could embarrass myself, she did it for me.

She looked at us and asked, “Uh, where can I find the inner for this shirt?”

Now, let me paint the picture: her younger brother immediately tugged at her arm, whispering, “They don’t work here!” But alas, the damage was done. Her words were out, our confusion was set, and we were all locked in a moment of collective embarrassment.

She quickly realized her mistake, turned a little red, and awkwardly started to step back. Meanwhile, my friend, my brother, and I had this classic idiot trio moment.

Friend: “She wasn’t talking to me. She meant you, right?”
Brother: “No way, bro. She was definitely looking at you.”
Me: “Nope. Not me. She totally aimed that at you.”

Cue awkward laughter and all of us avoiding eye contact like pros. The girl and her brother walked away, probably pretending we didn’t exist, and we spent the next five minutes trying to figure out which one of us looked like the most convincing store employee that day.

1iamgmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/anxiety_support/comments/1iamgmo/a_monthly_planner_of_activities_that/,A Monthly Planner of Activities That Significantly Reduces Anxiety (And Changed My Life),"Hi, everyone.  

I wanted to share something deeply personal that has genuinely changed how I manage my anxiety. I’ve struggled with anxiety for years—it’s the kind that lingers in the background of your thoughts and randomly sneaks up on you when you least expect it. I felt lost, stuck in a cycle of overthinking and constant worry. But recently, I developed a monthly planner of activities that has worked wonders for me, and I hope it can help you too.  

If you’ve ever felt like you’re drowning in your own mind, this is for you.  

---

### **Why a Planner? (A Personal Connection)**  
Before diving into the details, let me tell you *why* this works. Anxiety thrives on unpredictability and lack of structure. It makes your brain spiral because it’s searching for control in an uncontrollable situation.  

But when I started planning my month—filling it with purposeful, anxiety-reducing activities—I started to feel more grounded. Each day felt like I had a little victory to look forward to, even if it was small.  

This isn’t about cramming your schedule full or being hyper-productive; it’s about creating a balance of structure, rest, and joy. It’s about reclaiming control of your time, so anxiety doesn’t control *you*.  

---

### **The Monthly Anxiety-Reduction Planner**  

Here’s the breakdown of my month. Feel free to adjust this based on what works best for you. The goal is consistency, not perfection.  

---

#### **WEEK 1: Reset & Ground Yourself**  
This week is all about calming the storm.  

- **Day 1: Gratitude Journaling (10 minutes)**  
   Write down 3 things you’re grateful for. They can be small—like the smell of coffee or the sound of rain. This simple practice rewires your brain to focus on the good.  

- **Day 2: Declutter Your Space**  
   Anxious mind = cluttered space. Spend 30 minutes tidying up. Start small—a desk, a drawer, or your bedside table.  

- **Day 3: Nature Walk**  
   Spend 15-30 minutes outside. No phone. Just notice the colors, sounds, and smells around you.  

- **Day 4: Breathing Exercise**  
   Try this: Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale for 6 seconds. Repeat 5 times. Anxiety *hates* deep breathing.  

- **Day 5: No-Screen Evening**  
   Turn off your phone or laptop an hour before bed. Read a book, meditate, or journal instead.  

---

#### **WEEK 2: Connection & Joy**  
Anxiety can make us withdraw from people and things we love. This week is about reconnecting.  

- **Day 6: Reach Out to Someone**  
   Text or call a friend or family member you haven’t spoken to in a while. Just let them know you’re thinking of them.  

- **Day 7: Treat Yourself**  
   Watch your favorite movie, bake cookies, or order your favorite meal. Let yourself enjoy it *without guilt*.  

- **Day 8: Volunteer or Help Someone**  
   Helping others reduces anxiety because it shifts focus away from your own worries.  

- **Day 9: Plan a Coffee Date**  
   If social anxiety is hard, start small. Invite someone you trust for coffee or a casual chat.  

- **Day 10: Hobby Day**  
   Dust off an old hobby or try something new—painting, gardening, knitting, anything that sparks joy.  

---

#### **WEEK 3: Body & Mind Care**  
Your physical health is deeply tied to your mental well-being. This week focuses on nurturing your body.  

- **Day 11: Gentle Yoga or Stretching**  
   You don’t need to be flexible—just spend 10 minutes stretching or trying a beginner’s yoga video on YouTube.  

- **Day 12: Hydration Check**  
   Anxiety often worsens when we’re dehydrated. Track your water intake today. Aim for at least 2 liters.

### **Why This Works (And Why You Should Try It)**  

This planner might seem simple, but that’s the beauty of it. Anxiety feeds on chaos, and this gives you a gentle roadmap to follow. Even if you skip a day or two, you’ll find that the routine itself creates a sense of safety and stability.  

I can’t promise this will eliminate your anxiety overnight. What I can promise is that small, consistent changes *do* add up. You’ll feel less overwhelmed and more in control of your life.  

---

### **Your Turn**  

I’d love to hear from you:  
- Which activity resonates most with you?  
- Are there any anxiety-reducing habits you swear by that I could add to this planner?  

Remember, you’re not alone in this. We’re all navigating this journey together.  

Take care of yourself. You’re worth the effort.  ",2,1737916849.0,anxiety_support,1,1.0,False

But today it’s my ex’s birthday. I so wanted to reach out to her just to send her a short and friendly birthday message, but 5 days ago, out of nowhere, she either deleted my number altogether or blocked me on WhatsApp, and that hasn’t changed since. Either way, it’s a sign that she never wants to hear from me or have anything to do with me again. We haven’t been in any sort of contact for 6 and a half months anyway, so it seems like a deliberate move. Tonight I’ll be deleting her number, which breaks my heart all over again. 

A part of me really believed she would reach out again after she’d gone and dealt with whatever ‘mental health struggles’ she was dealing with 7 months ago and I would’ve happily waited for her because I loved her. I tried my best to fight for her, which probably pushed her further away, and I would’ve done absolutely ANYTHING to make the relationship work. I always imagined she would reach out and we’d have a coffee and talk about each others’ progress and maybe start over, both coming from healthier and improved situations. We would’ve had better communication and expressed our wants and needs. 

She was my first love and the person I truly thought I’d spend the rest of my life with. Now I realise I was foolish for believing she might want to at least just be friends. She never had any intention of it - she said she couldn’t say if the breakup was permanent but she didn’t want to ask me to wait. But I waited just the same. I waited for 7 months and I would’ve waited even longer.

Seeing she’s either blocked or deleted me completely out of nowhere is just confirmation that she has in fact simply moved on like the I was nothing and like our relationship was nothing. That was already after ending things in such a cold and dismissive manner. I think that hope and her refusal to give me finality to make things easier for herself has caused me unnecessary added pain. What was the point? What was the point of it all?

Today has been pretty rough and I feel pathetic for loving someone who clearly didn’t feel the same way. ",4,1737916533.0,BreakUps,4,1.0,False

This is my first time posting on Reddit, and I have dyslexia, so please bear with me as I share my situation. 
My boyfriend and I have been together for about 2.5 years, and it's been pretty challenging, but we're trying to make it work. He’s lived in New Mexico his whole life, working and taking two online classes while I moved here for school. I’m a full-time student, juggling a job, an honors thesis, and an internship, and I’m set to graduate in May with no idea of where I am going to live afterwards, but my boyfriend wants me to move in with him now. 
My boyfriend currently lives in a hotel room that’s been converted into a studio apartment, while I’m in a four-bedroom apartment at the university with three other girls who are all around 18-19. I only saw him twice weekly for the first year and a half of our relationship for various reasons. However, for the past year, he’s wanted me to spend time with him daily, which sometimes makes me feel overwhelmed. I've only had one other relationship before this that lasted only three months, while he was with his ex for eight years. 
He refuses to come to my apartment, so I'm always the one paying for Lyft or taking the bus to see him. The main issue is that his place is always a mess. I spend a lot of my time cleaning up after him. I can't even count how many times I've cleaned his kitchen, only for him to spill sugar everywhere while making coffee and just walk away, leaving it for me to deal with. I've tried talking to him about it, but he says he's doing his best. Honestly, I don't see much effort. I've even gotten pink eye from his bedsheets, and when I brought it up, he told me not to be so weak. Just this morning, I discovered he couldn’t find his toothbrush, so he started using the one he bathes his bearded dragon with. I tried to stop cleaning for him, but he let his sink pile up with dishes in dirty water for weeks and left food all over the counter. I have to wear shoes in his place because the floors are so filthy, and I keep the window open because I can't handle the smell. When he finally does “clean,” there’s still food stuck on the plates, and he gets upset if I ask him to clean again. My mom has OCD, so I grew up in a pretty tidy environment, while my boyfriend’s mom’s house made the place look clean. I think he feels offended by my requests because he genuinely believes he’s being clean. It’s becoming overwhelming. I’m starting to cry and have panic attacks from all the frustration of maintaining my own space, dealing with three roommates, and then having to clean up after my boyfriend, too. 
I keep telling my boyfriend that I'm not his mom and that he really needs to start taking care of himself. Even though he has a job, I end up paying for groceries, outings, and even rides whenever needed. If he asks for money, I give it to him. Recently, I decided to stop and told myself he needed to figure it out himself, so I went home for winter break, and while I was gone, I discovered that he had been using my card to charge $250 on Uber rides to and from work without asking me, which overdrew my account. He called it an accident and told me to chill out, promising he'd pay me back eventually. On top of that, he shares everything about our relationship with his mom, who thinks it's my role as his girlfriend to clean up after him, cook for him, and please him. I've been sick with strep throat for over a month and can't afford a doctor, and when I didn't feel like having sex this morning, he told his mom. She called him on the phone so she could accuse me of being gay and said that's why I can't please her son. I just said okay and walked away.
 All of this is why I hesitate to move in with him. However I spend a lot of my time at his place because my roommates throw parties during the week until 4 AM, which makes it hard to concentrate on my studies and sleep. If I try to stay at my apartment, he constantly calls and even sends me pictures of himself crying. He gets upset if I say I want to stay in my own room. I don't trust him to take care of my belongings, and his place doesn’t feel like home to me. My room is set up exactly how I like it with all my things, and I don’t want to deal with his mess on top of it all. I love him, and we work great together; he can be very sweet, kind, and loving, and do little things for me that make me feel special, but each day it feels like it is getting harder and harder, and things can't continue this way, but he won’t do anything to make my life easier. I’m just feeling really stuck and would appreciate any advice or suggestions on what to do? Thanks!",4,1737915993.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

Here’s how:

1. **Change where you smoke.** If you always smoke in the same spots, like your porch, car, or during specific breaks, try changing things up. Smoking in a new place forces you to think twice and helps break the automatic pull of the habit.

2. **Delay your first cigarette.** When the urge hits, pause for 5 minutes before lighting up. During that time, *think in detail about the long-term consequences of being a smoker*—how smoking affects your health, energy, and life overall. Then, *imagine the benefits of being smoke-free*: better health, more energy, and freedom from cravings. This simple pause can help you rethink the habit and disrupt the routine.

3. **Replace one smoking break.** Start by swapping out one cigarette a day – especially one of the ones you truly savor, like after dinner or with your morning coffee. Replace it with another activity that helps you unwind, like a guided meditation. Once those ""important"" cigarettes are replaced, the rest often become much easier to handle.


**These changes aren’t about quitting overnight—they’re about taking the first steps toward regaining control**. Every small choice adds up, and each one brings you closer to breaking free from smoking.",11,1737915911.0,stopsmoking,7,0.92,False

When making the espresso, a lot of times it barely comes out, I have to press the button twice then it comes out maybe otherwise just drops. When the tamped thing is empty, water does run through it, but otherwise with coffee it just kind of sits there in a gelatinous coffee state. 

I get 2-3 drops off coffee and on the second push maybe more comes out but always very burnt and acidic. 

The coffee does not wake me up at all, and it's harsh on my throat too. 

I tried multiple brands of beans, Starbucks, beanz, local fruit market variety. The ones we thought the best were la colombe nizza beans. 

But I will am not getting the same thing I would if I went to the la colombe Cafe myself.

Part 1 of Mischa: https://www.reddit.com/u/KatJen76/s/EsGt5OLMCu

Although Mischa and his family were safe from the worst of the war, they decided to leave the country. Doug and Melissa did a lot to help, and by that summer, for the second time in his life, Mischa was on a plane bound for Uranium. 

Oksana found work quickly with a resettlement organization. The family stayed with Doug and Melissa for a couple of months. Uranium was even more depressed than when he left, with a lot of vacant homes. One of those  homes had belonged to Noel's grandmother and had been on the market for eight years without a single inquiry. Noel happily sold it to his old friend. Mischa and Doug spent the summer fixing it up. School was back in by the time he was done. He walked the kids to St. Cassian's and came home and realized he had nothing to do.

The next day when he walked them to school, he saw Father Markus across the parking lot. He meandered down to the vocal room to say hello. It turned out that Father Markus has first period free, and it became a routine. Mischa would stop by the Blackwood Cafe for coffees for both of them, drop the kids off, and chat. They talked about music, teaching, their lives, everything. Father Markus asked Mischa about his plans. 
Mischa said he really wanted to stay in Uranium but had been unable to find a teaching job. He talked at length about how surprisingly pleasant it was to be back. How his kids loved St. Cassian's, loved Melissa and Doug and their Romanian son. But how much he missed teaching and music and working with students. 

Father Markus listened and said nothing.

The next day, he told Mischa that he'd wanted to retire for years, but was worried it would leave St. Cassian's without a music program. He asked if Mischa would take over for him. They began making plans, with Mischa working with him through the fall and getting to know the students so Father Markus could do one last Christmas concert. After Christmas break, Mischa became St. Cassian's full-time vocal director. 

As for Father Markus, he enjoyed a pleasant retirement. He traveled while his health allowed. He became an extended member of Mischa's family, having Sunday dinner with him and his family. Mischa cut his grass and shoveled his sidewalk, or sent his kids to do it. When Father Markus died, Mischa organized a large memorial concert featuring a lot of his compositions. Its centerpiece was a huge alumni Zoom performance of ""Uranium."" Ocean, Noel, Ricky and Penny all sang on Zoom, with Constance joining the in-person performance. It was so successful that an annual alumni Zoom chorus was started to fund the Father Lewis Markus Memorial Scholarship for a St. Cassian's student who was involved in music and planned to teach. Mischa and Oksana continued to present their Odessa method at teaching conferences. And as a teen, Mischa's son dubbed himself Radioactive Bad Egg and gained a large YouTube following for his Abandoned Uranium content.",2,1737915813.0,ridethecyclone,1,1.0,False

Actually, I used to hate coffee and was frowned upon by the bitterness every time I drank it. But all that changed when my close friends at tech club took me to an amazing specialty coffee shop - it revolutionized the way we think about coffee. I was amazed to find that coffee could be so flavorful. What started out as joy for the group of us quickly grew into a deep shared passion for exploring the world of specialty coffee, and ultimately seeding our brand.

After graduation, I worked at TikTok/Bytedance for three years, gaining valuable engineering experience and technical expertise, but I never lost my love for coffee.

One day, it occurred to us why not combine our passions and expertise to make a positive impact? We hoped to empower coffee lovers like us to brew and enjoy coffee better. Then we created the BOOKOO brand. The name “BOOKOO” means “not bitter” in our language - reflecting our mission.lol.

I'm working on operations and product development within the team. I love what I do now because I feel like I'm contributing to the coffee industry, connecting people all over the world, and talking with the world through our products. Looking forward to many more wonderful things to come.

Starting with espresso gadgets - current products:
- BOOKOO Themis Mini Scale: A precise, smart, and compact scale with visual recognition and flow display capabilities.
- BOOKOO Espresso Monitor: A pressure sensor that provides in-depth analysis for the perfect espresso extraction.
- BOOKOO PUCKGO 3-in-1 Tamper: The ultimate tool for coffee puck prep, combining an impact tamper, dosing ring, and WDT distribution tool in one.

We never stop - upcoming BOOKOO Motto80 grinder.

Ask me anything about our journey, products, or anything coffee-related!

1ialybc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1ialybc/my_husbands_getting_drinks_with_a_coworker_and_im/,My husband’s getting drinks with a coworker and I’m terrified.,"My husband (35M) and I (34F) have been together for nine years, married for five. He was showing me a video on his phone the other day and a text came through from a female name I didn’t recognize. I asked who it was and he said she’s a colleague from a company that his company works closely with. He has text previews turned off so I couldn’t actually see what was said but my suspicions were raised. 

I know it’s wrong but when he was in the shower that evening I looked through his phone to see who this girl is and why she’s texting him. I found out that they’ve been getting coffee and lunch during the workday, sometimes to talk about work, sometimes not. Prior to last week, it was maybe once a month communications to plan these, but then she joined a board that he’s on last week. So they had a board meeting and then seemed to go out as a group for drinks after until about 11. I did know that he was out with his colleagues during this time and wasn’t concerned. What is concerning is that he texted her that night making sure she got home safe and telling her how much fun he had but that he’d been hoping to have more opportunities to talk with her instead of everyone else. The next morning, he texted her good morning and asking her to drinks one on one next week. She agreed and he said he couldn’t wait.

Of course I looked her up and she’s a very beautiful woman, probably in her mid 20s.

I asked again later who she was and what their connection was. He reiterated that she’s a colleague and is helping get him connected with exciting opportunities in her organization. I know he’s been really focused on networking and she has a lot of high up community connections that it looks like she’s introduced him to. He’s also a friendly guy who likes to be involved, through board work and professional groups. I don’t want to go scorched earth and accuse him of anything inappropriate since my insecurity has been a major issue we’ve had to work through in the past but I’m terrified he’s going to cheat on me. Would this send off alarm bells for you and how would you respond without accusing him and ruining the marriage?",2,1737915736.0,Marriage,39,0.6,False

I’m slim, attractive, empathetic, a good listener, emotionally intelligent and personable. I have a good job that I work on contract, usually work 6-9 months a year and have the other months to myself. I’d say I’m a pretty good catch besides that I smoke cigarettes but I’m in the process of quitting. But even with all that, and the confidence I get from it, i have a hard time meeting girls who are interested in me, and if they are I just can’t seem to keep feelings for anyone I’m emotionally involved with. They all become sort of a weight on my life, where I feel I give more to them than and I become drained emotionally by trying to support the relationship, they take away from my happiness and excitement to focus on their needs and when I set boundaries so that doesn’t happen, they emotionally pull back/close off or I do and then things kinda crumble from there. I have one friend of over a decade who I’ve always had consistent feelings for, and she’s the one who got away, returned and kept getting away for a variety of reasons. Right person, wrong time in my opinion. As much as she takes she gives back, she excites me and stimulates me to do better, be better and each moment with her is like a gift. I’ve come to terms that we will never be together and a friendship is all that is healthy for us but I know the type of relationship I want with a partner because of her, but no one else I’ve met has given me that feeling. I’ve been accused of comparing that feeling and my desires and looking for it in others when I really don’t. I just have a standard of what I’d like in someone and no one can live up to it, but in todays world I understand things are rough and mental issues for a variety of reasons can really damper a persons true colors. I try to give my all most days and to entertain someone who only does that on their best days just seems silly to me. I understand relationships are a lot of work, and that growing together and seeing the value in someone, helping them achieve it with support and love is crucial to a relationship/love but I just seem to find anyone with potential. I’ve tried many different approaches to meeting people, from bars, coffee shops, book stores, dating sites, friends of friends, hobbies and each one of these has left me feeling even more isolated and alone on my search for love. I’m just not sure what to do anymore. I have no problem with a casual relationship or intimacy, but nothing strikes me as long term relationship potential. I’m just down and out, as I’m a hopeless romantic at heart that’s been beat down by the struggles of dating in today’s world and just want to find my person. Waking up alone and having no one is just so depressing and makes everything else seem so shallow and empty.

It’s tough to tell if what I’m working on is something people would actually want to play.  

Here’s my experience so far, and I’d love to hear if anyone else has dealt with the same challenges or has other ideas:  

Reddit – This seems like the best community by far for idlers, clickers, and incrementals. I noticed the Feedback Friday posts here, which seem like a good starting point. There's also subreddits like r/DestroyMyGame.  

Twitter/X – I couldn’t find much activity or discussion here.  

Blue Sky – About the same as Twitter, but I like Blue Sky more since there’s way less spam.  

Discord – I’ve found some game-specific Discords for popular incremental games, but no general Discords for incremental/idle game devs or players.  

Playtesting – I’ve tried getting feedback from friends, family, local college game dev clubs, random people at coffee shops, and even Fiverr. This has been the most useful so far.

Through an 'Transactional Analysis' course, I’ve identified that my feelings of inferiority in certain settings, especially at work, stem from early childhood experiences where I always felt out of place and I decided it was safer just not to try to belong.

While I know rationally that my colleagues respect me and see me as an equal, I can’t seem to shake this underlying sense of inadequacy and not belonging. I've worked at this school for 7 years now and really feel like part of the team. Yet, on the first Monday after Christmas break I walked out of the New Year's reception early because I had no idea how to connect with my colleagues! 
At the same time, I feel very connected to my students, possibly because I relate to their process of growing into independence.


I’ve created an action plan to challenge this pattern, including:

1. Reflecting on my successes and practicing affirmations to reinforce my self-worth.


2. Take notes of positive acknowledgements I received from colleagues. 


3. Taking small steps to build stronger connections with colleagues, as well as with friends (e.g., checking up on them, ask about their weekends/lives, inviting friends for coffee).


Moreover, I stopped using my social media accounts. This has already helped me feel more 'part of the adult world' and I'm already feeling a lot better about myself.  What I’d love to hear your thoughts on is:

1. What has helped you overcome similar feelings of inferiority or not belonging to the larger group?

2. How do you stay motivated and consistent with your self-improvement efforts?

1ialojq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ialojq,Homesick Italian - opened my own coffee shop - advise needed,"I’m a homesick Italian coffee nerd who could never find the perfect cup of joe in the coffee available where I live. So, I started importing coffee roasters that I really like and began selling them online to other customers (most of them are also Italians or people who frequently visit Italy for holidays).

Three months ago, I opened a physical store where people can taste the coffee and also grab something for breakfast. (I’m from Sicily, and we love pistachio, so I make pistachio croissants here!)

I’m currently teaching myself latte art, and I wanted to ask for some tips. Even though I’ve watched a lot of videos, I’d love to exchange ideas with other baristas to hear their beginner tips.

For those who run a shop with both a shop and a takeaway option: how many of your customers just grab a coffee to go, and how many buy coffee for home or come in for advice?

I don’t even think I have a low supply and am providing just enough for baby. She shows all the signs of happiness… wet/poopy diapers, content after feeds and gaining weight… but in the back on my mind I’m worried. If I go longer than every 3 hrs… say 3.5hrs one time in the day, worried! She sleeps overnight now and I have allowed myself one long 3.5hr-4hr stretch and then I pump or feed but if I accidentally sleep longer, worried. If I drink coffee in the morning and don’t start chugging water til 2 hrs later, worried. Then I worry about future concerns… she sleeps overnight now, but what if she doesn’t in the future, how will I have enough milk for her??

I usually start my first week cutting out obvious sugars and then I weed out sauces and things that are more hidden. 

But today the honey mustard bbq sauce I was drizzling on my sweet potatoes and meatballs was too sweet for me! I believe it has 12g of added sugar. I wanted to use it up because my husband doesn't like mustard and won't eat it but I guess it's going to be a pass for me too. 

Another update I went down to two pumps of sugar free coffee syrup in my coffee from four. When I drink black tea I only use half and half and my goal is to work towards doing that in coffee as well.  

I've really enjoyed having plain oats with a spoonful of peanut butter and a chopped up banana in the mornings. It doesn't taste plain to me anymore but instead very sweet and satisfying. 

I'm waiting for it to be a week before I jump on the scale again but I'm confident I'll see it go down as well. 

Just checking in. Feel free to share your own experiences too!

Edit: I was unable to finish my diet soda because it felt too sweet. Guess I'm off soda too lol",3,1737915122.0,sugarfree,1,0.81,False
