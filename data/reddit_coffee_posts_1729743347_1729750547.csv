1gavw2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1gavw2p/cleaning_maintenance_advice_rancilio_silvia_v6/,Cleaning & Maintenance Advice [Rancilio Silvia V6 & Eureka Specialita grinder],"Hi everyone,

I bought myself a Rancilio Silvia E V6 espresso machine and Eureka Specialita grinder around a year ago, and I'm wondering what the common maintenance tips are that people may have... I typically make 2 milk-based coffees per day.

In terms of what I currently do to clean/maintain them, I only use filtered water in the Silvia, and I run a cleaning chemical in the blind basket every 2-3 weeks and clean the steam wand (including blast it out) after every use.

For the Eureka, I pull pull the top burr out every 3 months and give it a relatively deep clean... however I'm always worried I'm going to break something doing that!

I'm keen to hear what others do as their regular cleaning schedule.",1,1729749906.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

My sister have been battling obesity for years now. The problem? She tracks all her macros, exercises a few times a week, but the kg’s keep on coming. We went to the doctor this week, a new one since the others keep sugesting wegovy, which would be fine if She actually were over eating. She does not even get above 2000kcal a day.

1gavtja,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gavtja/im_a_receptionist_at_a_plastic_surgeons_finale/,I'm a Receptionist at a Plastic Surgeon's (Finale) ,"[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ffhtyx/im_a_receptionist_at_a_plastic_surgeons_part_1/) [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ftdd3u/im_a_receptionist_at_a_plastic_surgeons_part_2/) [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fyqy9y/im_a_receptionist_at_a_plastic_surgeons_part_3/)

I was apprehensive about meeting Dr. Harrison for this coffee date. The only thing that made me want to take it, was finally learning what the hell was happening. And a part of me was excited to be on a date with Dr. Harrison. Even after everything that I had seen at the clinic, including him ripping his own face off, a part of me was squealing like a teenager finally landing a date with her crush. And, even if I did quit afterward like I wanted to, I would at least finally know what was going on at the clinic. With Wilson, the patients, Dr. Harrison, everything. Maybe even the lost and found thief. 



Normally, I don’t take very long to get ready, but a part of me wanted to put more effort into this meeting. In my head, it was going to be the last time I ever saw Dr. Harrison. So I put on my nice pair of jeans and button-up, surprised that it still fit me since the last time I wore it was during my cousin’s wedding. A quick spritz of perfume and I was ready. And in my head, I felt stupid, it wasn’t like this was an actual date. But I figured I might as well take advantage of it. 



I was happy that I was allowed to choose the coffee shop and picked one close to the city and further away from the office. I wanted to be around as many people as possible and was happy to see that the shop was pretty busy. I took a seat at a table near the window to look out to see Dr. Harrison when he finally showed up, and so others could see us in case something happened during our ‘date’. I sat there and began to shake my legs anxiously as I waited for him to show up.



I didn’t have much longer to wait when I saw him approaching the coffee shop. It was so offputting to see him in clothes that weren’t his scrubs and lab coat. A turtleneck wasn’t something I ever knew he would wear, but seeing him wearing that was enough for me to immediately know that I had made the right choice in accepting this date. 



“Good morning, doctor,” I told him as I stood up from my chair when he entered the shop and walked over to me. He looked at me and gave me a soft smile, as he rubbed his hand through his brown hair. 



“You can just call me James, Maggie. We aren’t at work at the moment,” he said with a little chuckle. It was a force of habit. It’s like trying not to call your old teacher Mr. or Mrs. “Have you ordered yet? I know I have…a lot of explaining to do to you.” I shook my head and he led us over to the barista. He ordered a simple black coffee and I got a basic latte. You can judge me all you want, and you’d be right. I’m basic. 



We both sat down at the table and stared awkwardly at our coffees. It was obvious that he was trying to find the right words, so I just sat there taking small sips from my latte. Finally, he cleared his throat and looked at me with those beautiful green eyes. 



“About five years ago…I was attacked.” He sighed heavily, lifting the hot black coffee to his lips and taking a small sip. “I was attacked by a patient. She wasn’t satisfied with the work I gave her. I had told her that I could no longer operate on her because she was clearly addicted to cosmetic surgery. She didn’t take the news well.” He took another sip from his coffee cup. 



“What did she do?” I asked him, trying to imagine how her attacking him had led to…everything that happened at the clinic daily. “If I can ask that, of course.” I cushioned my invasive question, but Dr. Harrison didn’t seem to mind, giving me a small little smile. 



“She threw a cup of acid at my face. Sliced it up real good with a scalpel, and as a chaser lit it on fire. The only reason I’m still alive is because Rachel threw mop water on me to put out the fire. The acid was harder to wash off.” He explained, the smile still on his face, but his eyes betrayed just how traumatizing it had been for him. 



I looked at his beautiful face and didn’t see a single scar, or any blemish. Then of course I thought back to him ripping his face off back at the clinic. And it suddenly all hit me at once. His need for skin, him coming into work with his face covered up. 



“That isn’t your real face, is it?” I asked him, placing my drink on the table to stare at him. He looked at me in the eyes and I stared into those big jewels he had. A soft swirl began to appear in his eyes, and my head began to throb suddenly. 



“It isn’t…” He looked back down at his coffee and my headache disappeared the moment his eyes were taken off of mine. “But for an entire year, I was in recovery, and even though I got reconstructive surgery…that…fucking bitch…ruined my face!” He shouted, quickly looking around at the other patrons who snapped their attention over at us. “Sorry…” he said with a heavy sigh. 



“But…if this isn’t your real face, how did you get it?” I asked him, doing my best to avoid his eyes. As beautiful as they were, something about them suddenly began to rub me the wrong way. I gripped my cup close to me and kicked myself for not getting something hotter. If he tried something I could at least throw scolding hot coffee in his face as a defense mechanism. 



“It’s…a long story.” He looked down at his cup of coffee and pushed it further away from himself, staring down at the table for a long while, as he gathered up the courage to tell me. “After she attacked me, I…lost my mind. In more ways than one,” He gave a little giggle before he quickly stopped and cleared his throat. 



“I uh…started…I uh…” He let out a heavy sigh, the embarrassment and shame he was feeling was palpable to me. “I started killing people…to give myself the satisfaction of having a better looking face. Heh…it sounds stupid when I say it…but I earnestly thought that it was helping me.” He continued to stare down at the table, while I stared at him in shock, he had broken the Hippocratic oath and the fucking law as well. 



“James…that doesn’t answer my question,” I told him, thinking he was deflecting.



“Oh I’m getting to that…see after I had killed my parents…” I couldn’t help but let out a gasp and quickly covered my mouth. “My mother…she uh…insulted my face. So I hacked her to pieces. And my dad was so in love and attached to her, that I couldn’t let him live in a world without her.” He explained with a nonchalant shrug. “But soon afterwards…I met my savior.” He explained with whimsy in his voice. 



It suddenly clicked in my head. “The man on the phone?” I asked him. He finally looked up from the table and nodded enthusiastically, his green eyes shining so brightly I thought he’d blind me. 



“Mr. Sinclair found me…and put me in touch with someone who gave me powers to…sculpt my beautiful face back.” He reached his hand to his face and let out a happy hum. He was like a giddy schoolgirl talking about her high school crush. Or like how I talked about him. “And…I’m sure you’ve noticed my beautiful eyes. It’s hard not to, I’m sure.” He giggled a little. 



His demeanor was completely different than normal. The smooth, almost aloof handsome surgeon had transformed into a deranged madman before my eyes. The ease with which he told me he killed his parents and other people terrified and all the while his eyes began to drill into my very soul. 



“You’re very special, Maggie. You have a healthy self-image, that’s what drew me to you. My eyes, they can control people with low self-esteem and people who are easily manipulated. Hypnotize them almost. But you…I can’t control you. I can suggest some things to you…but I can’t control you,” he told me, his eyes gleamed brightly and I snuck a peak at them. I stared deep into them and, to my surprise, saw spirals in them. 



“I was gifted with these eyes, and with the powers to…meld skin.” He smiled widely and suddenly he reached across the table and grabbed my hands. I flinched backward but he held onto my hands tightly. “I use other people’s skin to replace my own. And I can meld the human body into any shape that I want.” People were starting to look at us now and some were even murmuring. I prayed that one of them would come over here and get me out of this situation. 



“D-Dr? Y-you’re hurting my hands,” I squeaked in pain as he squeezed them. That seemed to snap him out of whatever state he was in. His eyes dimmed and he looked down at his own hands and he quickly let go of them. 

  


“I-I’m sorry, Maggie.” He told me, instantly retreating into his seat and frantically pushing his hair back into place. “I uh…got carried away.” He reached out and grabbed his cup of coffee and took a long sip from the cup. I rubbed my own hands and looked down at them. 



“So…it isn’t permanent, is it? You need to keep doing it? Taking…people’s skin?” I asked him, trying to get him back on track, and hoping that he would maintain his normal composure. He looked back up at me like a confused puppy. 



“Oh…yes. Unfortunately, it isn’t permanent. Every few weeks I need to replace it. Nothing I’ve tried has been able to make it last longer. Not only that, but I can’t control this power very well either. As you saw with Wilson and the last patient, if I don’t concentrate hard enough, things go very wrong.” He took another long sip from his coffee. 



That answered a lot of questions. Why Wilson was a goop monster and how the human body suddenly turned into a scorpion creature. An awkward silence again came over our table as I tried to process everything. My boss was a murderer, an evil plastic surgeon who had somehow managed to go underneath the radar. And yet, after this bombardment of information I had a random thought that I wanted to know.



“What keeps stealing from the lost and found?” I asked him as I started sipping my watered-down latte. He looked at me with confusion on his face, and then suddenly it clicked in his head and he couldn’t help but start laughing, 



“That thing, you don’t have to worry about it. It's mostly harmless,” he said and started laughing about it. I looked at him and couldn’t help but worry about the fact he called whatever it was ‘It’. That didn’t do much to instill confidence. But I also thought about another important question. 



“Why does Rachel hate me so much?” I asked him. He looked at me after finishing up his giggle fit. He nodded and reached into his pocket, pulling his phone out, and pulled a picture up. He flipped it over and showed me. I took it from him and stared at it for a good long time. It was Dr. Harrison with another chubby woman. It took me a few seconds to realize that, it was Rachel. 



“I think she’s projecting. I helped her lose all that weight and excess skin, but she also is projecting onto you. Unlike her, you’re comfortable with who you are. She still isn’t. She’s more plastic than skin at this point.” He sighed as he reached over to take his phone back. My mind was barely functioning now. 



“Sir…I don’t think I can work with you anymore.” I told him after I took a few more minutes to collect all my thoughts. I just couldn’t bring myself to continue working at the clinic. Fuck all the money, I no longer felt safe there knowing what kind of person Dr. Harrison was. 



“What?” He asked in shock. “No. No, I can’t allow that, Maggie.” His voice was drenched in desperation. His eyes lit up again and my head began to throb like a hammer was being smashed into it. He was trying to get into my head again. “Maggie I can’t allow you to leave! I refuse!” He reached out and grabbed my hands again. I panicked and quickly reached out to the nearest object I could find. Yanking one of my hands out and grabbing a napkin dispenser, I smashed it against his face. 



“You bitch!” He screamed, standing up and staggering around. He looked at me with rage in those beautiful eyes. Where I had smashed his face, the skin was now dangling from his cheek, revealing heavily scarred skin underneath it. People were murmuring and talking, Dr. Harrison flashed his eyes at all of them and growled like a cornered animal. “What are you all looking at?! Piss off!” He screamed at them, and everyone went on their way like nothing even happened. 



I quickly stood up from the table and backed away from Dr. Harrison while he stared at me with anger in his eyes. “I-I’m sorry sir! I just don’t feel safe anymore!” I told him, backing up and searching through my purse, pulling out my pepper spray and holding it in front of me like a shield. 



“I can’t allow you to quit, I’d rather kill you than let you leave.” He told me, grabbing the flap of loose skin and ripping it off with a sickening tear. More of his true face was revealed, more heavily scarred and misshapen skin. It was almost like looking at a real life ‘The Picture of Dorian Grey.’ Half of his face was stunning but the other half was scarred and heavily damaged. 



After a small standoff with each other, Dr. Harrison lunged at me and I deployed the pepper spray at him. I covered his face in it but he still tackled me to the floor and began to strangle me. I choked and gagged as he applied pressure to my windpipe. I tried to pry his hands off of my throat but his hands were like iron and I couldn’t get them off. The pepper spray seemed to not affect him so in desperation I reached up and began to claw at his face with my nails. He screamed out and quickly let go of my throat to touch his face. And while he did I quickly shoved him off of me. 



Standing up and sucking in air, I quickly ran out of the coffee shop, with Dr. Harrison screaming after me. I managed to reach my car and quickly started it up, peeling out of the parking lot and almost hitting some pedestrians on my way out. In panic, I called the only person I could think of to help me. 



“Why are you calling me fatass?” Rachel asked me as I started driving towards the clinic. “I thought you were on a date with Dr. Harrison.” She sounded extremely jealous, and if he hadn’t just tried to kill me I would’ve understood where she was coming from. 



“Listen you bitch, I know you used to be fat too. Now shut the fuck up and help me. Dr. Harrison just tried to kill me, and I damaged his face and he’s probably gonna kill me, and I need your help.” I begged her, gripping the steering wheel tightly. There was a good long pause. 



“Meet me at the clinic. Mr. Sinclair should be here soon and he’ll be able to calm him down.” She sighed, before hanging up on me. I let out a soft sigh and sped up slightly to get to the clinic. I arrived soon afterward and quickly ran to the clinic door after parking. I was thankful to have a key and I quickly slipped in. 



“Hi, Maggie! I thought you didn’t work today.” Wilson was surprised to see me, but he was also happy to see me. I quickly waved at him and ran past him, quickly sitting down in my seat and letting out a long sigh. Just as I sat down, something hit me in the head. It was small and before I could register what it was, another thing hit me in the head. Looking around I saw that two bottlecaps had hit me in the head. I looked over to the lost and found box and noticed that several items were moving around. 



I carefully and sneakily rolled my chair over to the box and peeked inside. I saw an item that I knew for a fact had never been in there before. A burnt piece of bread. And to my confusion and shock, it was moving around in the box looking for something. It was walking around on black noodle like appendages and was ‘speaking’ in squeaks and hisses. 



“Uh…hi?” I tried talking to it. It stopped dead in its tracks and turned to look at me. It had several human eyes stuck to its crust and all of them stared in various directions. Once they all landed on me, the bread creature let out a loud screech. Just as quickly, it grabbed some random keys from the box and ran out of the box at speeds that would make the road runner jealous. I couldn’t even process what had just happened. A burnt piece of toast with human eyes and noodle appendages had been stealing from the lost and found box. 



As I sat there trying to process what I had just seen, Rachel finally entered the clinic and walked over to the desk to meet me. Her usual bitch demeanor was different, she seemed like a normal person for the first time. 



“Good, you’re not dead.” She sighed, looking back over at Wilson and motioning for him to come over. “Mr. Sinclair should be here soon and he can usually talk sense into Dr. Harrison, so we just need to hold him off until then.” She looked over at Wilson who finally made his way over to us. 



“Wilson, make sure not to let Dr. Harrison through, okay? Otherwise, I’m turning the heater on.” She ordered him. Our security guard gave us a salute and quickly made his way back to his position, locking the door and standing near the door like a dog who knew someone was about to enter. 



“So…he told you, huh?” Rachel asked me as she tied her hair up in a ponytail. I looked over at her and nodded a bit. I tried to imagine her as the lady in the picture. There was no indication that she had ever been anything but a thin bitch. 



“You hate me 'cause I’m fat? Or are you just projecting on me?” I asked her, keeping a side eye on the lost and found box, not sure if the bread thing was hostile or not. “Or maybe a little bit of both?” I asked her with a little giggle. 



She sighed and leaned on the desk to get a good look at me. “It’s probably both. I had so many insecurities, and here you are just as happy as could be. It pisses me off. Even after I got the surgery, I still don’t like myself. Maybe that has part to do with what I help Dr. Harrison do.” She sighed, rubbing her face and groaning softly. 



“What does he do exactly? Obviously, I know he skins people, but how do people keep coming back here?” I asked her. 



“He replaces it with silicone. Even me, I’m more plastic than a Barbie at this point.” She looked over at the door quickly when someone started trying to get inside the clinic. When angry knocks started pounding at the door we both figured that it was Dr. Harrison. 



“Is that plastic skin, stabproof?” I asked, quickly looking around for some kind of weapon to use to defend myself. 



“No, unfortunately.” She told me as she took her purse off and placed it down on my reception desk. She fished through it and pulled out a taser. I looked at her with a raised brow and she shrugged at me. “When you’re this pretty you need something tougher than pepper spray.” 



“Pepper spray didn’t work on him,” I told her, rolling over to the lost and found box and searching for something to defend myself with. I picked up a small pocket knife and quickly blew the bread crumbs off of it. It was going to have to do. 



“Let me in, god damn it!” Dr. Harrison screamed from the other side of the door. I looked over at Rachel, wondering what her plan was. I didn’t get a chance to wonder because Wilson simply opened the door for him. 



“Wilson! What the fuck?” Rachel shouted, but one look at him told us that he had unfortunately locked eyes with Dr. Harrison. He meekly stepped aside after opening the door and Dr. Harrison rushed into the room. His beautiful face was gone, replaced with the heavily scarred and damaged face he had described. His right ear was gone, his hair was in clumps growing from his head and he had no eyelids to speak of. That woman had done horrible damage to his face, and I could almost feel sorry for him if he wasn’t about to try and kill me. 



“Sir, I need you to calm down, please,” Rachel told him, pointing her taser at him. He stared at her like a rabid animal and looked down at the weapon pointed at him. He walked over to her and she slowly began to lower the taser. I looked over and let out a whimper when I saw that his eyes her shining again. I hoped that Rachel might be able to resist as I could, but she wordlessly got out of his way as he continued his approach over to me. 



“Maggie…I can’t let you quit. I won’t let you.” He told me, his eyes burning with anger and the swirls on full display as he tried to get to me. My head throbbed and I quickly swung around in my chair and ran out into the hallway toward one of the operating rooms. He screamed after me, and I slammed the door, quickly locking it and even pushing a chair up against the door. I was trapped and I had no way out. 



I started to look around for anything that might help me. But all the cabinets and tools were locked behind keys that only Rachel or Dr. Harrison had. In my search, I suddenly noticed a black spot on the wall. It almost looked like mold, but as I walked over to examine it, it grew rapidly in size. And before my eyes, I watched as a tale, pale, and blond man stepped out from the now giant stain on the wall. 



He was the most well groomed man I had ever seen, and with giant bags under his eyes, he also looked like the most tired man in the world. He looked around the room and then over at me. He stared at me like he found a cockroach in his soup. 



“You’re the receptionist who called me?” He asked me as the stain disappeared behind him and slithered into the shape of his shadow. I nodded at him and figured that this was Mr. Sinclair. Just as I had been introduced, Dr. Harrison began banging on the door. 



“Maggie! Open this fucking door!” He screamed, slamming his fists against the door. Mr. Sinclair sighed as he rubbed his tired eyes. I stared at him and then down at his shadow. I was shocked to see two bright white eyes staring back at me from his shadow, and a giant white grin came across the shadow’s face. 



Sinclair walked up to the door, moved the chair out of the way, and opened the door. Dr. Harrison slashed down with a scalpel, but Sinclair caught him by the arm and stared down angrily at him. Dr. Harrison quickly snapped out of his rage and stared up in shock at Sinclair. 



“S-sir! I-I…” He tried to say something but no words escaped from his lips as he stared at Sinclair. 



“We talked about this, James. How big of a mess are you in, now?” He demanded to know. Dr. Harrison looked at him again and sheepishly looked back down at the floor like a scolded child. “Let’s go to your office. We have a lot to discuss.” Sinclair walked past him after releasing his arm. Dr. Harrison looked over at me before dropping the scalpel and following after Sinclair like a puppy. 



Rachel walked in a few minutes later, rubbing her head softly and looking ashamed at having failed to help me. But I walked over to her and hugged her tightly. Just happy that I was still alive and not sliced into pieces completely. Dr. Harrison and Mr. Sinclair stayed in the former’s office for over an hour, before Harrison walked out of the office and walked over to one of the operating rooms. 



Mr. Sinclair walked out of the office, puffing on a cigar and staring at me. He beckoned for me to come over to him. I walked over and instantly felt the pressure mounting on me as I walked over to him. 



“I understand you don’t want to work here. But James has…issues with people leaving him. And if you do leave, I cannot guarantee your safety.” He explained to me. As he talked, a skeletal-like figure appeared behind him and smiled at me, gurgling and dripping black sludge on the floor around him. 



“B-but I don’t feel safe here.” I tried to explain to him, but he held his hand up to silence me, and the creature gurgled again. Almost like it was laughing at me. 



“I understand that. But I can offer you more money to keep working here and to keep him happy and most importantly out of trouble.” He reached into his suit jacket pocket and pulled out his checkbook. I was going to turn him down instantly. And then he showed me how much money was being offered. 



I also specified that I wanted to ensure my safety while working here. He agreed and made sure to talk to Dr. Harrison about it. And, I accepted that money, on top of my paycheck as well. And I’m still working here to this day. 



Dr. Harrison continues to fix his skin with other people’s. But since I decided to keep working here, he hasn’t flipped out on me once. And now knowing his secret, he does seem to be even friendlier to me. And even Rachel has been nicer to me, but she does still have her bitchy moments, but I’m more than capable of handling her. 



I don’t feel good about working here. And now that I know what goes on here, I feel disgusting watching people get their skin taken away for Dr. Harrison to continue looking absolutely gorgeous. But the silver lining is the amount of money I’m earning. I can turn a blind eye to most of this. But some days I do think about quitting. 



And then I feel those green glowing eyes staring at me. And I’m reminded that I’m stuck here.

Fairly easygoing, kind, honest, and respectful personality. In my free time, I like to volunteer using my tech skills, read up on the latest in nutrition and health, try new exercises, or binge on a hidden gem of a horror movie. I love a good plain black coffee!

In terms of what I am looking for, there honestly aren't a lot of boxes to tick. Just be easygoing and actually interested in having a good conversation. No restrictions on timezones, age, relationship status, religious beliefs, etc. However, if you like to stay fit and are into exercising, or planning to get into exercising, that'd be a big plus!

Please introduce yourself a bit when you message me, just so we can start working on breaking the ice... and because a random one-word ""hi"" doesn't exactly provide much room for a conversation 😌

1gavqml,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tech_Philippines/comments/1gavqml/what_to_do_with_my_m1/,what to do with my m1,"context, i bought a secondhand m1 macbook air in great condition. used it for a month before accidentally spilling coffee on it :( immediately took it to a local trusted repair shop. it took them weeks to ""run diagnostics"". almost a month later, they were able to turn it back on with issues of the laptop not being able to connect to the internet. tech guy suggested i just buy a wifi dongle.

they asked for a dp but the store manager insisted on making sure that the issue was fixed, so my money would not be wasted. fine. they did stuff which took weeks yet again. they said the logic board was corroded by the coffee spill so changing it would be what will make the repair costly/extreme depreciation in value. they were not able to turn my mac back on. in the end, they returned the dp i sent prior, and apologized.

it's been months since then and my m1 is on stand-by and idk what to do with it. i could have it fixed but it'd be really costly. i could sell it but i've been told that it will be of very little value.

it's really heartbreaking, what happened. it was my first big-ish purchase with money from my first job fresh out of uni.

anyway, if any of you could share some advice on the matter, please let me hear them :((

1gavm7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeGapRelationship/comments/1gavm7x/our_story_56f_27m/,Our story (56F & 27M) ,"I married my high school sweetheart in 1993. We were young, thought we had it all figured out, and like many people in their 20s, believed that love would conquer all. The same year we married, I started working at the university I remain at today teaching history. Our son was born in March 1998, and for a while, everything seemed well enough. Shortly after the birth of our son, I found out, after just over five years of marriage, that my husband had been unfaithful on multiple occasions. I won’t ramble with the details, but it was devastating. I wanted to fight for our marriage, not just for me, but for the sake of our son. Unfortunately, the feeling wasn’t mutual. My ex husband filed for divorce in 2000 and that was the end of that. I was granted sole custody of our son. 

For years, it was just me and my son. I didn’t date. Between my job and being a single mom to a child who needed a lot of my attention (my son is on the spectrum), I didn’t have the time, and more importantly, I didn’t have the interest. Truthfully, there were plenty of guys who tried—colleagues, other single dads, even students —but I turned them all down. I didn’t feel any doubt or hesitation about it. I was done with a romantic relationship.

Fast forward to the fall semester of 2015. I had a freshman student in my class who stood out in a way no student ever had before. He was the complete package - tall, blonde, blue-eyed, extroverted & humorous, and absolutely brilliant. I don’t throw that word around lightly. This was a kid who was basically teaching the class some days. He knew more about certain topics than I did, something I can’t say any other student had managed to pull off before so that’s saying something.

We got close during the semester, but nothing inappropriate, obviously. He was my student, and that was that. But after the semester ended, we kept in touch. We’d grab coffee, talk about history, life, whatever. It felt harmless, at least at first. Then he started pursuing me. Openly. That threw me for a loop. He wasn’t subtle about it either, which made it even more awkward for me at the time. I was not the kind of person who was pursuing a relationship, let alone one with a guy significantly younger, let alone someone who was once my student.

But I was also undeniably attracted to him. He was funny, kind, and, well, persistent. The age gap was extremely challenging to me at first, I won’t lie. But eventually, he won me over. He made me laugh in ways I hadn’t in years, and more than that, he made me feel seen. I felt a love my heart had quietly been searching for since the day my first marriage ended. It was something I didn’t even realize I’d been missing for so long.

A year after we began dating, he proposed. It was fast but it also felt so right. We got married a few months later in September 2017, and let’s just say the wedding night was… eventful. We conceived our daughter that night! Nine months later, we welcomed her into the world and just like that, I got the daughter I had always wanted. 

Then came four more daughters. Yes, you read that right. Five girls, and there’s another one on the way. If you had told me ten years ago that I’d be a mom of seven kids, I would’ve laughed in your face. I always figured I’d just be a boy mom with my one son. Couldn’t be more grateful to be here though! 

I semi-retired from teaching after our second daughter was born, but I still teach a few online classes every semester just to keep my sanity intact. Between our kids, my husband’s tech startups, and everything else, it’s a lot. But my husband has built a great life for us, and we’re comfortable, which is something I’m incredibly grateful for.

I NEVER imagined any of this. Not the marriage, not the kids, not the love I feel for this wonderful  man. And yet, I’ve never felt so understood or so loved. He’s truly my partner in every sense of the word, and I can’t imagine life without him.

So yeah, life didn’t turn out the way I planned, but I wouldn’t change a thing. I’m beyond grateful for my husband, our daughters, and the crazy, beautiful life we’ve built together. Sometimes, the best things in life are the ones you never saw coming. ❤️❤️❤️",3,1729748773.0,AgeGapRelationship,1,1.0,False

Howdy folks! I know it's a little early, but throwing this out there anyway. My gf and I are looking for one roommate (no couples) to live with us and our kitty in our 2 bedroom/1 bath duplex conveniently located in midtown (close to the Co-op and Temple Coffee on S street, a light rail station, and all major freeways). Link to our listing on the Roomies website: [https://www.roomies.com/rooms/207594](https://www.roomies.com/rooms/207594)

🏠 Rent is $900/month (includes internet) plus utilities which range from $80-160/mo total for the whole household (SMUD only) and will be split evenly amongst all 3 of us. The room is approx. 10x10ft. (unfurnished) and the apt has central air and heat. The rest of the apartment is fully furnished. The washer/dryer is accessible from outside on the bottom level. The fireplace is functional and you’re definitely welcome to use! You will have a guaranteed parking spot in a gated space right outside. There’s also a cute little patio upstairs and small garden area available for use downstairs.

⚠️ The apartment is upstairs and landlord lives below. No additional pets please as our kitty unfortunately does not get along with other animals (but does love cuddling with anyone who has a cozy blanket). You must be willing to share previous landlord references for past 5 years and must be willing to share proof of income for the past year. No smoking inside or outside at any time.

1gavk02,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gavk02,Solo Traveler in Bali (7D 6N),"1. Di ko inexpect airport ng Bali. Ang laki ng difference sa NAIA lol. Mukhang malaking toilet NAIA pag kinompare mo sa Bali.

2. Sobrang ganda ng Bali. May parts na mukha siyang Pinas pero yung culture talagang na-maintain nila. Temples left and right, ang ganda manood ng celebrations nila lalo pag nago-offer sila sa God nila.

3. Foods in Bali 10/10! Wag ka lang kakain sa Warung to avoid Bali Belly. If with ice yung drink mo, always ask kung filtered ba gamit or tap water. Honest naman sila kasi aware din sila sa Bali belly. Sobrang mura ng foods if hindi ka sa tiktok famous restos kakain.  May nakainan akong chicken meal with coke worth 10,000 IDR / 37 pesos satin.

4. My favorite midnight snack lol. $2 pizza including delivery fee.

5. Stayed 2 night in Seminyak, 2 nights in Canggu, and 2 nights in Kuta. Def mas mahal sa Canggu kasi mas madaming tourist pero ang sarap gumala dito. Kahit san ka tuminggin may kainan & beach clubs.

6. Day tour in Uluwatu. Sobrang ganda! Parang straight from pinterest yung view lalo na yung beach. Hindi ma-pick up ng camera kung gaano kaganda yung view swear!

7. Compare Grab / Gojek before booking. Minsan mas mura sa Gojek, minsan naman sa Grab. My 4km ride was only 1,500 IDR sa Gojek / 5 pesos satin. 😆

8. Did a Day Tour in Ubud. Sobra daming temple here. Sulit din yung free coffee, tea, and hot choco tasting. Hindi ko inexpect yung durian coffee. Unique yung lasa pero masarap. ☺️

9. Highly reco to do Bali Swing! Ang saya niya haha tsaka maeexperience niyo gaano kagaling mag picture Balinese. Para akong model sa dami ng pose na inuutos nila. 😂

10. Hotels in Bali are vv affordable. My 2 nights in Seminyak with direct pool access costs me 950 per night. 2 nights in Canggu costs 600 per night. 2 nights in Kuta costs 900 per night. Lahat yan may pool. Pero favorite ko yung sa Canggu kasi mas bago yung facilities, may working area, jacuzzi, and vv sociable mga guests.

11. Hindi mahirap makahanap ng friends sa Bali. Sobrang daming solo travelers here. I was able to make 5 friends (2 from Australia, 1 from Germany, 1 from Hungary, and 1 from Brazil) and nagp-plan na kami next travel together! ❤️

12. Ingat lang sa mga guys na lalapit and mago-offer drink. Take extra precautions. Takpan drinks to avoid getting drugged. Okay lang mag sinungaling about yourself lalo if feel mo pinipilit ka na. But overall, super fun & ganda ng Bali! Babalik balikan promise. 🌸",48,1729748519.0,phtravel,25,0.98,False

I need help deciding which coffee machine I should get. This will be my first super automatic machine. My budget is around 500$. The only requirement I have is that the machine needs to make good strong espresso.  I don't care about lattes, cappuccinos and other stuff. 

The choices in my country around that price range are:  
\- Philips EP1200 Series

\- Delonghi Magnifica Compact ECAM22.115B

\- Delonghi Magnifica Evo

\- Krups EA817010

I don't remember the artist first name but I think the last name was Smith.
The opening lyrics were
""Make the coffee
Make the bed
Now it's time to get ahead
And go, go ,go.... go, go, go""

The chorus had the words ""slow down"" but it was sand much slower than the beginning of the song.

The video was filmed in a frame rate which made the movements feel rushed. It was in a big white room. There were off camera people doing the singers hair, giving her coffee, books, etc.

At the end of the video, she threw a briefcase open and all thw papers went flying around.

I think I originally found the video on reddit.

i´m here for some buying advice, as i want to upgrade my home setup. I am usually a more ""easy going"" type of guy, so the ideal would be to make good coffee as easy as possible. From what i´ve heard, the integrated grinders of machines like the La Specialista are not worth it at all, so i am happy for your help. 

Thanks in advance!

1gavfwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/pestcontrol/comments/1gavfwl/baby_roaches_issue/,baby roaches issue?,"I live in a townhome in a congested city, so I’m used to seeing bugs. However, when it gets out of hand, I freak out—and so do my kids. I've lived here for years without major issues, but when my neighbor is messy, problems arise.

The townhouse next door is a rental, and if the tenants are dirty, I end up with roaches. Four years ago, during COVID, some tenants moved in, and I had a serious roach infestation. The owner used foggers, which just drove the roaches into my home. I had to leave for two days because they were flying everywhere. When I confronted the owner, he had no idea \[about the foggers; I later found out it was the tenant who used them and lied to me.\] I once visited \[the tenants'\] place for coffee, and I was shocked by how filthy it was, especially with kids living there.

Eventually, those tenants were evicted, and the new ones had no issues. But after some city construction (new sewers for the entire street), I started seeing a few roaches again, which I managed. Now, though, the new tenant has turned their unit into an Airbnb without the owner's permission, and I’m seeing baby roaches everywhere! I've tried using Spectracide, Raid, and Hotshot from Home Depot, but it hasn't helped. They're in the kitchen, on the sofas (I just got new ones!), and even in my bedroom during work meetings.

I have a special needs child who is really scared and wants to leave the house. I don’t want to confront the neighbors because that could lead to conflict. I need a solution that actually works. I've noticed various types of baby roaches—Oriental, German, brown-banded—and now there are mosquitoes in one room. What should I do? I already called an exterminator and they just sprayed throughout the house and that only helped it for a few days.

I see about 2-3 in the kitchen, and then 2-3 living room, and then yah idk. I have been dealing with it since this tenant moved in which was in May but it has gotten really bad now. I have even seen ant-size roaches. Also, 1 month ago, we got the whole home professionally cleaned, and also carpet washed, threw out old sofas, and just got new ones, etc.",1,1729748048.0,pestcontrol,1,1.0,False

1gavaqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/numerology/comments/1gavaqu/how_synchronicity_with_jayz_over_444_triggered_my/,How synchronicity with Jay-Z over 4:44 triggered my mental illness,"I’m currently 18M, when I was 16, I started to see 4:44, at first, it was on the treadmill, and I didn’t see it anywhere else so I tried explaining it away, like I would exhaust myself 4 minutes and 44 seconds into my run every time, prompting me to check the timer right at 4:44, I don’t know, it made sense to me at the time. This continued for about 6 months, until just before my 17th birthday.

Days leading up to my birthday, the bakery I worked at had a special, one slice of cheesecake and a small coffee for 4.44, and the handout my teacher had given us said “printed at 4:44pm”, I couldn’t explain these away, leading me to look up 4:44 on June 30th last year, the day before my 17th birthday.

As I typed in “4:44” into google, the first link I found was Jay-Z’s last album titled 4:44 because that was the number Jay-Z was seeing, so much so that he would often wake up at exactly 4:44am but he didn’t know why. And that’s why Jay-Z named his album 4:44.

Upon further examining, the album 4:44 was released June 30th, on the day I’m looking it up! And it is also the day before my birthday. And when I looked up Jay-Z, I realized his birthday December 4th is one day off from my mom’s birthday, December 5th.

This is when the delusion started to set in, it begun as innocent as me realizing that it is all connected, somehow, Jay-Z was related to me!

I started to believe that I was special, chosen, and that like Jay-Z, I had special messages to deliver. So I sent emails to my teachers, friends, classmates, even the local tv station detailing my special connection to Jay-Z and the mechanisms of this connection.

Somehow, I had believed that I had been awakened, and that it was my divine purpose to wake those around me, who are all “asleep”, I envisioned that each individual had a counterpart as someone rich and famous and that our relatively mundane lives is just a cover, to keep us chained and asleep.

My teachers eventually called 911, and police showed up to take me to the hospital. I spent about a month in the psych ward. Doctors made the diagnosis of bipolar at the end and discharged me on meds, but they didn’t address any of the coincidences I had observed.

Of course, at the time, I didn’t realize even that they were coincidences, it was only after I was discharged, upon more self-oriented research, did I manage to find the term synchronicity and I suddenly realized that what I experienced were just coincidences, albeit, very personal coincidences.

I think the greatest delusional inducing part of all this is knowing Jay-Z and I shared seeing 4:44, something so private I thought, and yet, here it is, this rich and famous and talented artist had witnessed the same unexplainable phenomenon! This was instrumental in my delusions of self-importance and how I believed I was chosen to spread some divine message that would wake everyone up so they see the truth of it.

And what a ride it’s been.

Now, I don’t believe I am special, or chosen, or whatever, I barely even believe me and Jay-Z are connected, but I do still believe I have a special message to preach, and that is this:

It's been 10 years since I last took ADHD medication, for a specific reason I have to get back on.. But that's not the point of the post. 

Alright, so back then I never had heard a single thing about supplements and coffee interacting with my meds. I'm on methylphenidate modified release. 

I drink 1 liter of coffee every morning over a period of 1 hour, after getting dressed I drink my meal shake, about 20 mins after my coffee I take my meds and morning supplements which include 1000 mg C vitamin. 

I've only been back on meds for a month or so, I have not noticed any side effects or that my medication doesn't work, so I don't know if maybe because I've been doing this morning coffee routine for 18 years and never feel bad after that much acidic stuff in my stomach, I dunno, maybe it doesn't affect me?! I don't feel jittery from coffee, I actually don't even get any energy or anything from it, my morning coffee ritual is strictly routine like many other things I have done to manage my ADHD symptoms without meds (=slow start to the day, sit down, having enough time for 4 cups of coffee+getting ready means I get up early...)

Although my taste pallette is not sensitive at all, and I can hardly distinguish subtle changes in the flavor, I've observed that when my coffee starts to lose the temperature, the acidity is somehow more pronounced.

As an example, if I've over extracted my coffee and it tastes bitter. After awhile when it cools down it becomes less bitter and more acidic.

My first few sips tastes different and my last few sips different.
This is definitely the case when I brew it with aeropress,
Even in mokapot brew, I've observed same things but very subtle difference.

1gav60x,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1gav60x/my_housemate_is_driving_me_insane_literally/,my housemate is driving me insane (literally),"Disgusting and inconsiderate housemates/roommates, what’s new?

I live with 3 other girls so there’s four of us total. Our apartment unit has 4 rooms and 2 bathrooms, so we each have our own room but two would share 1 bathroom. I personally didn’t choose this arrangement, but we’re students and it was the university’s assignment (affordable, convenient). I went into this thinking it can’t be too bad considering we each have our own room….I was wrong.
I’ll call them housemates A, B, and C. B and C are great. A is the problem. She gave off red flags the moment she moved in. I tried to be understanding at first because she’s an international student and she was adjusting. She also said she’s homesick so I was sympathetic.
However, I can only be sympathetic for so long when I started to notice the next couple things…
The first thing I noticed about her was her smell. She smells pretty bad. It’s not even the smell of BO. She smells like wet mold. 
I unfortunately have to share the bathroom with her because of our room placement. Her towel hung in the bathroom smells terrible, and it has these suspicious brown stains on them. The next thing is that I had to clean up stains on the toilet twice…poop and period stains. This next part is probably what bothers me the most…she doesn’t wash her hands, ever. She doesn’t wash them after using the toilet. I know this because our sinks are in a separate area. The toilet and shower is in one room, and sinks are in a shared area. Our rooms face the bathroom, so it’s easy to hear everything…she would do her business, flush, and go straight to the kitchen to make food. I’ve considered confronting her, but how do you tell a grown adult to wash her hands after using the bathroom? Aren’t we taught this since we were 5? I admit because of my field of study, I am a bit of a germaphobe, so you can only imagine how much this bothers me.
I’ve tried my best to enforce a system where we take turns cleaning the bathroom once each week. Luckily, she agreed to it and she’s done it 1-2 times but I don’t think she really cleans the bathroom. I feel like she half-assedly wipes the top of the toilet seat and then takes out the trash. HOWEVER, guess where she dumps the bathroom trash? Into the already full kitchen trash…

She also only makes messes but never cleans anything up. Whenever she uses the kitchen, there would be crumbs/coffee grounds/stains all over the counter and floor. She dropped a pile of coffee grounds on the floor RIGHT NEXT to the trash can, and she didn’t clean it up. After she cooks, she doesn’t rinse down the sink, so all of her food chunks are just left there and it once it dries, it’s hard to scrub off.
Despite knowing for sure it was her, I’ve tried to be polite and texted our group chat without pointing her out. Of course, she always ignores these texts. I am the only one that really vacuums the apartment and deep cleans the kitchen once every week, but I’m especially pissed off because I would have to clean up every time after she uses the kitchen.

I’ve tried to confront her about a couple things by texting her directly and she ignores every single one of them. I know she ignores them on purpose, because she would always reply quickly whenever it’s unrelated to her habits. Honestly, I wouldn’t be as pissed if she at least acknowledged them, but she chooses to just ignore them. When I confront her in person (and I try my best to be as nice and polite as possible), she says she’s sorry but then proceeds to do the same thing a couple hours later. 

I feel like I haven’t been getting much sleep because her room is right next to mine and we share a wall, and she’s pretty inconsiderate. She has the habit of slamming the door late at night. Because our walls are very thin, it shakes the whole apartment. She also comes home really late and makes dinner around 9-10PM, and would blast her show/music on her phone while she cooks/eats. I have confronted her (in text and in person) about the door slamming and it hasn’t gotten better. She also doesn’t hold back on making noise in other ways. She’ll even come back humming or singing late at night and wake everyone up. I can’t sleep in on the weekends either, because she would get up around 7am and blast music/shows. It’s making my anxiety a lot worse because I can’t help but anticipate when I’ll be woken up by her antics when I’m sleeping. I also feel like the door slamming gets worse whenever I confront her about her habits, like she’s doing it on purpose.

I’m starting to build a lot of resentment towards her. I don’t feel comfortable even though it’s suppose to be my home too. I am always cleaning up after her, but I don’t want to be ‘that’ kind of person to micromanage her living habits so I’m trying to endure what I can. I’ve started putting away my things so I wouldn’t have to share with her since her habits give me anxiety, but I can only do so much when I have to share the kitchen and bathroom with her.

I think it’s funny how she told us she purposely chose to live with 4 people, but then doesn’t know how to be considerate of others. I always do my best to stay out of everyone’s way, keep shared spaces clean, be as quiet as possible (I’m really close to my family, but don’t call them after 7PM because the walls are thin and I don’t want to bother my housemates). I never invite anyone over. I leave around 7AM for work/school in the morning, and I come back around 5-6 PM (or later), and would usually just quickly shower, eat dinner, and just stay in my room. I feel stressed and overwhelmed when I come home and have to clean up after others before I can settle down for myself.

I’m not sure what to do. I’ve talked to housemate B about this and she agrees on many things, but I don’t think she has to deal with as much because she doesn’t share a bathroom with A. Her room is also further from the living room so noise doesn’t bother her as much. I don’t want to be the one person who kicks up a storm, but it’s really affecting my mental health because I can’t get enough sleep, I have to sacrifice the little free time I have on the weekends to clean up the apartment, and I’m constantly on edge because of the noise.

I don’t have a car right now and I’m living in a city that doesn’t have convenient public transportation…so I don’t have the option of living off campus.
I feel like my only option right now is to just suck it up and endure it, but I feel like I’m going to lose my shit. I’m seriously about to look into getting therapy after writing this post.

In search of a genuine connection, so let me share a little bit about myself! I’m 33 years of age, an Aries, from the wonderful Southern California. I work in banking for one of America’s top banks, and have been in the industry for close to 9 years. I’m 5’9”, divorced with zero kids, Hispanic, with a pierced nose and one arm and one leg full of tattoos. In my free time I enjoy resting; nap anyone? I like trying new restaurants, coffee shops, breweries, bars, you name it, I love to try it! I enjoy traveling, mostly to city centers or countrysides, not so much beaches. I don’t play many video games or watch anime at all, but that doesn’t mean I’m not open to it. I like trivia nights, sporting events, farmers markets, plant stores and antiques.

I guess what I’m looking for is a partner. Someone I can connect with, someone I can have fun with, someone to be lazy with, someone to travel with. Looking for some to make laugh and to make me laugh. I guess someone to do anything and everything with. Not really sold on one relationship type, so I am open for discussion!

Maybe you’re out there in the world, and maybe I’m the one you’re looking for, or maybe I’m not but let’s chat like we’ve been friends for ten years and see where it goes. No pressure, no expectations, just two people connecting.

1gauxz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gauxz7/heart_anxiety_nightmare/,Heart anxiety nightmare,"Summer of 2022, May. I’m at EDC Las Vegas (EDM festival). It’s day 3 (aka last day), 5am. Festival just ended, on my way to the airport for my early morning flight back to Canada. I’m still high on party favours from the week-end, tired. I want my bed really bad. In all my wisdom, I get a triple iced latte at the airport before boarding my flight. The second the plane lifts up from the runway, my heart starts going cra-zy. Palpitations, super high heart rate, sweating — all alone because my friends live in LA. In my head, all the worse case scenarios: I’m having a heart attack, I’m dying, they’re gonna have to divert the plane and I’m gonna make the headline of some Montreal newspaper as the junky who took to many pills at a party. I land in Montreal, nothing anymore. I managed to sleep on the flight (still don’t know how). Mom picks me up from the airport and I go home to sleep.

Fast forward 2 days: it’s midnight, I’m about to fall asleep and I get this alert on my Apple Watch that my heart rate is high. I get up feeling dizzy with my heart going at 180. I rush upstairs to my mom (she’s a doctor). She takes my heart rate and blood pressure. This “episode” lasted a minute but felt like an hour. I slept with her that night and that’s about it. The next morning, I explain to her what happened on the plane and tell her about the party favours. She didn’t seem worried at all but suggested I see my doctor just in case. 

Week later, I see my doctor. She sends me to see a cardiologist who does an ECG, echocardiography, and the treadmill test. All good, except that one thing on my ECG. Cardio diagnoses me with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. I need to get a small surgery to burn an extra nerve in my heart that makes it have palpitations. So he sends me to a cardiac surgeon

It’s now July 2022. Met the surgeon, old guy. But he knows his shit. He was in the journal for his work and won awards. I’m happy about that. He does another ECG and echocardiography. We go over the results, he sees the same thing on my ECG, but doesn’t agree with the diagnosis. He says he’s not worried at all, and that I’m not at risk for anything. He then makes me sign a paper to get the other hospital to send over the test results the cardiologist had me take.

Fast forward 3 weeks. I’m leaving for Electric Zoo NYC in a few days. I’m driving and I get a call from him. He says he got the results, and now he thinks I need the surgery. Now I can’t get travel insurance, so I have to cancel my plans. He puts me on the waiting list for the surgery. I got the call in November that they were going to do it a week from there.

I get to the hospital with my boyfriend. I’m only there for a day, I’m going home once it’s done. They put the IV in, shave my entire body, and wheel me to the OR. The surgery itself is minor, they go through the arteries in your groin. I honestly didn’t feel much. As they are navigating my heart, they try and stimulate different parts of it to see where the extra nerve is to burn it. But after 2h, they come to the conclusion that I don’t have one, and that my heart is super healthy. They wheel me back to my room, had me stay there for a few hours just in case, and send me on my merry way home.

I honestly don’t remember how I felt back then, but ever since that day, I’ve had crippling anxiety about my heart. I’m always scared that my heart is going to stop without any warnings. There isn’t a day, or even an hour I don’t think about it. My doctor diagnosed me with GAD, we tried a few SSRIs at different doses and nothing worked. I only had side effects. I gained a ton of weight, I couldn’t get my downstairs part to work, I felt numb to happiness. It’s now October 2024. I don’t take any medications anymore, apart from the occasional Ativan when I get a bad panic attack. I went to the ER a few times because I thought I was dying. My life has been hell ever since that back and forth with the diagnosis. You have something, nah you don’t have anything, nevermind we want to operate, ahhhh fuck it it’s good you’re healthy.

I don’t know where to go from there. My life has been a nightmare since. I’m anxious about my heart 24h a day. I still have palpitations, sometimes get scared that my heart will stop out of nowhere. I don’t take party favours anymore, I stopped drinking coffee. I vape tho.

That being said, I still live my life. I go out, I travel, work and go to school. If I didn’t tell you, you would never know. But deep down, it’s always there. That intense fear that my heart is in fact not fine. But I know it is, that’s the thing. It’s been almost 2 years now since the surgeon that literally explored my heart told me I was fine. But the anxiety is telling me it’s not.  This thing is powerfully terrible.

1gauwjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/SgHENRY/comments/1gauwjo/networking_building_biz_relationships/,Networking & building biz relationships,"What are your go to approaches to networking and building business relationships?

Some thoughts from me:

- As I progress through my career, I feel like I'm starting to transition away from the usual bars  and late nights to more quieter and formal dinners. However, relationships tend to be formed through experiences - when you get loud and drunk, everyone becomes your best friend and you get to talk with a client about that crazy night of drinking you had together. How does one manage this transition?

- As time becomes even more precious with family and kids, is there a role to play with more daytime activities. The working lunch aside, do people focus on coffee catchups? I suppose if your clients are in the CBD it's easy enough to arrange but sometimes it doesn't make sense to travel any considerable distance purely for a short coffee. 

- The role of a country club membership. I'm not talking about golf specific country clubs (perhaps another topic for another discussion). Was thinking of getting one. I have some friends who host at the tower club / american club etc. But most other country clubs tend to be a bit further out. Assuming one wants to balance having the country club for the kids to play on the weekends and yet wants to entertain - what's the right balance to strike?

Looking forward to some thoughts on the above specifically and the art of networking in general!",1,1729745956.0,SgHENRY,1,1.0,False

1gautca,https://www.reddit.com/r/missoula/comments/1gautca/opinion_on_missoulas_ice_cream_and_more_history/,Opinion on Missoula's ice cream and more history than you need on the matter,"I've been on a multi decade journey through Missoula's Ice cream parlors. My GI track has crushed not gallons but barrels of creamy, frozen goodness. My waistline is a muffin top made of rocky road and sweet sorbets that swells with the July heat each year. With so many years of knowlege under my belt, I feel that I am well qualified to judge who serves up the iced cream best. 

Here is a ranking and a history, please add if you remeber anything else. Dont try to argue this. I have more ice cream time than any of you and I know my cream! 

1. Baskin Robins. Consistantly the best. I abandonded it in the early 2000/s and now it is better than ever after going to these trendy new places. perfect portion size, flavor is spot on, no lines, price is reasonable. I do want the culigan water cooler back, the pink and brown booths, but am overly impresssed with the elderly lady scooping ice cream like it is whipped cream. 

2. Seeley Lake The Ice Cream Place. For value this place is amazing. The line is no worse than Big D, and the soft serve is bomb. The frozen yogurt is spot on too. The hot asphault makes the ice cream taste even better. Its not claiming to be fancy and its priced appropriately. 

3. 5 guys shakes. If I want a shake this is it here. If I found out it was  made out of all the rattlesnake missing cats I would still get one occasionally. Lots of flavors and Its not overwhelming. 

4. Big Dipper - yep, forth. Okay, I have argued with servers there to give my kids a smaller portion on multiple accounts. I say politiely "" Excuse me, my 20 pound child does not need the full kids scoop, can you maybe do half? I'll pay the same"" they act like im asking for extra and refuse with a mind blown look on their face, and hand my kid a cone the size of their head. I came here for ice cream, not diabetes. Flavors are great, but that line is not worth it. I also dont want to feel fat after I leave, so I for one dont appreciate a 32 ounce double scoop. cut the portions and the prices down for gods sake.  I get it its ""Local"", but how local is it? where is the big dipper factory, riddle me this? I heard its just Meadowgold rebranding it and making special mixes for them. We go here a lot, probably more than anywhere else due to geographic location, but I still dont think it is as good as the places above.  

4. Sweet Peaks - Too Sweet. I like it and am interested in sampling the flavors, but that is really as far as I want to take it.  Who really wants pine needles in their ice cream? I like the vibe, but it is a 3x's a year stop for me max. 

5. Dairy Queen on Higgins. When the Dennis the Menace cups went away and they switched to DQ brand, a little part of me died. when I eat it I feel like its just corn sizzuurp and cream. I have also seen the soft serve snot before its put through the machine and it was a big turn off. 

6. All the DQ's  - When I really need a hit I go here, It's either here or a Wendys frosty. I just need something cold and wet. I fly on a sugar high and my ears burn till I wake up in the morning for some reason after I eat this. 

7. 406 frozen yogurt - Im not happy here. It is messy as all hell, I feel sorry for the workers, and I dont feel safe in the bathrooms. When I get rang up, I am also nervous my card will decline due to the high cost. I'm sorry, but I have hundreds of coffee cards with one punch that I have glimmer of hope that I may use but I will not be keeping my 406 frozen yogurt punch card for fututre use. P.S. when I see red hots spilling over into the gummy bears in the toppings counter, I just about lose my mind. Keep it organized, this is a business.   
Mcdonalds - The Mcflurry was a big part of Missoula's ice cream history when all there was in town was a blizzard. You aint much to look at now, but at one pint in time you were a heavy hitter. 

Freddy's frozen custard - this write-up is not about custards, sorry Freddy. I dont even know what that is but it sounds yucky. 

Gone but not forgotten : 

TCBY on Brooks.I didnt know what frosen yogurt was but it was chronic. I can still taste the strawberry chocolate swirl. 

Cold Stone - Too Sweet and too much. I felt  like I was gettig diabetis when I went there. Is it still open?

Baskin Robbins where Harbor Freight is - Not sure why you didnt last? 

Mr Freeze on 3rd : I only went here once and got my first tripple bacon cheeseburger there with a marshmallow shake. They shut down pretty quickly after that

Brownies drive through on broadway ; only hit it once and got a shake, it was good and then it was gone. like a weird dream

Big Sky Drive in/through on Broadway. nTHey had a huge menu of flavors for sundays, soft servs, shakes and malts. Never had a bad one. This would be at the top of the list and was at an extremely good value. 

93 Stop and Go; I dont actually have memory of any shakes here but I'm sure they had them. 

Late 90's there was a place where the Pagoda was that served dill ice cream. I went there twice and I always wanted to try it, but I never did. 

Del's Place had an amazing shake menu. I had many friends who held down their first jobs there and did their first hard drugs in their bathroom. One friendtold me he smoked crack in there and experinced a real bell ringer, whatever that means. He even got this great experience while making $5.75/hr. Not what I expected from such a tasty establishment. 

Uptown Diner, never went there. I saw people with those big shakes and asked my parents to take me there, but alas, it never happened. They told me ""Thats where rich people go son, lets go to Casa Pablos"". 

Rosauers: Rosauers used to be the only place to get whopper ice cream. They always had wild ass flavors in their coolers. We used to make special trips across town to get ice cream here back in the late 80,s/90s.

Kmart: they used to sell ice cream in a weird kiosk in the front with some popcorn. The whole place had a weird burnt popcorn/melting plastic smell. 

Thats it. dont argue cause this is all factual opinion.

If you’re a recent grad (21-25) living in or around Sugar Land and looking to meet some cool people, this is for you!

Whether you're working, job hunting, or just figuring out what's next after college, let’s create a space to chill and connect with others going through the same phase of life. We can organize meetups, game nights, coffee chats, or just explore what Sugar Land has to offer!

1gaumsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/PanicAttack/comments/1gaumsj/someone_please_help/,someone please help,"Just a warning this is going to be long, I got attacked at a bar by a group of girls about 6 weeks ago. I got hit in the head REALLY hard over and over and therefore got a concussion. This is the first one I’ve had, I went in to the er the next day and got a head ct and it came back clear. The first few days I was just feeling pretty foggy and out of it and had a headache and those were really my only symptoms. By day 4 I messed up and was feeling GREAT so I (stupidly) thought I was good to go back to lifting weights, and while I went super light compared to normal I felt horrible that night and the next day and all of my symptoms were back. I learned my lesson and accepted that I have a brain injury and am super fragile so I took a break for about a week and have now been slowly trying to work my way into doing everything like normal, but I am struggling horribly and I can’t tell if something else is wrong or it is still the concussion. My symptoms don’t get worse anymore after working out since I’ve been taking it easy but it seems like either something else is making me worse of I have a whole other problem going on. A couple weeks after I started getting really bad anxiety and panic attacks, I have had anxiety for a long time but never experienced a panic attack. My doctor told me I had post concussion syndrome even though it had only been 2 weeks since the attack and prescribed me lexapro, I had been on it before and it was fine but this time it made everything 1000x worse. My pupils got HUGE, i would feel normal for maybe 10 mins and then have way too much energy and feel too happy to the point it didn’t feel good if that makes sense, I have never had a manic episode before but if I had to describe it that’s what it felt like and it was horrible I thought I was going to die and it took about 3 days for me to feel better. She told me to stop taking it immediately and I have been too scared to even try any other meds ever since. I then tried some upper cervical chiropractic and had one appointment and it seemed to help decently but I haven’t had another appointment for that yet. I just keep going back and forth between having all of my symptoms gone besides brain fog and feeling absolutely insane and like i’ll never get better. I took a complete break for the first few weeks from alcohol because I wanted to recover from my concussion first, I’ve tried a few times to go out with friends and drink but haven’t tried more than a few drinks because I’m terrified its going to kill me or something. Sometimes I have a couple drinks and I feel pretty decent but I’m scared to push it past 2 or 3 because I’m convinced something bad is going to happen. I have been feeling REALLY good the last week or so, so I finally wanted to try to drink again so I had plans with friends Saturday. Saturday afternoon I wasn’t feeling the best but good enough to go about things as normal so I went to get my nails done. As soon as I got there I started feeling kind of icky, sat in the chair and all of a sudden I did NOT feel good. I felt faint, my heart was racing, I couldn’t breathe, my vision was messed up, I was shaky, its so hard to put into words the feeling but I genuinely accepted that something bad was about to happen with me and they were going to end up calling an ambulance. I made it through somehow and went home and felt slightly better. I decided I wanted to still try to go out and see friends so I did, my bestfriend and I planned to pregame before and I was getting that yucky feeling again but we decided I should try a drink because if this is due to nerves/panic attack maybe a drink will help and I would rather know how it would make me feel before I’m out in public. The drink seemed to help so I thought I was good, I kept slowly drinking to hold a buzz and on and off I would either feel fine or feel like shit and not good again. I finally decided to go home early and I just felt “off” in the worst way. All day yesterday (Sunday) I felt horrible and basically the same high anxiety and super panicky it was awful. It’s hard to explain the feeling but sometimes it comes with the physical symptoms of racing heart, lightheadedness, and extreme anxiety, and sometimes the feeling is just an EXTREME feeling of something is very wrong. Any doctor hasn’t helped me whatsoever and no one is taking this seriously and I feel like I’m going crazy. I have also noticed if I have any caffeine even just a single cup of coffee for the day that makes it incredibly worse and I had one Saturday morning but that doesn’t make sense to me that that would make things THAT bad. Is caffeine really making this that bad? Are these just severe panic attacks coming and going for absolutely no reason or could something worse be wrong? Is this just an inflammation problem? This is the only concussion I have had as said before so could this even be post concussion syndrome? Has anyone else experienced this?? I just want to feel normal again I can’t take this anymore, its really affecting me mentally and I’m terrified to try any meds because of what happened with the lexapro. I have a hair appointment tomorrow and I am terrified to go in fear that I’m going to feel like that again. I can’t do anything besides sit at home and go to work because I’m scared of getting that yucky feeling and I’m scared anything I put in my body whether it be caffeine, alcohol, or medication, is going to bring that feeling back. please help",1,1729744944.0,PanicAttack,1,1.0,False

Here’s a bit about me:

45, male, ex-full time pro musician (I compose music for film/tv/games as a side hustle now and have been trying to start an original band for a decade, I do have a tribute band project I play with now), working professional, not into sports, but I do like the gym and golf. (Put a post up looking for workout buddies and got zero response after 2 weeks).  I don’t play or particularly like video games but do enjoy table top or role playing games. 

I’m married, 15 years next year and have been together for 18, and we have no kids by choice. We live in the deep SE, but I don’t mind travelling/driving - but it should be reciprocal (in other words I don’t want to be the only one driving across the city to hangout every single time) 

I like whisky and cigars, smoking meat on my back deck, bbqs and back yard fires. I like comedy (live and movies) love nearly all kinds of music except rap/hip hop or the tragically hip. We enjoy the opera and symphony but I also like going to jazz clubs and rock/metal shows. (Not much into punk).

I have tattoos and plan to get more. I also enjoy all kinds of art and trying new foods/restaurants. I also cook quite well.

I work with all women and as much as we get along, they are not my friends. My wife and I would be interested in meeting another couple for friendship but I really am looking for a guy friend. Hopefully in the same age range - younger is probably ok too but I’ve found that younger than 35 gets a bit difficult as our lifestyles are just so different. 

I was trying to find out about and maybe get involved with the Masonic lodge but that turned out to be a dead end. Not sure what else to do - volunteering I guess? 

Anyway - now I’m just rambling, reach out via DM and maybe we can see if we wanna grab a beer or a coffee sometime. ",3,1729744687.0,CalgarySocialClub,2,1.0,False

When I was pregnant, I kept hearing the advice to not stop living my life and not let everything revolve around the baby—just to incorporate the baby into our lives. It seemed like such a reasonable idea at the time. But now that our baby is here, she just seems to hate being a baby.

My husband and I love going out to eat, traveling, and discovering new places. We were told that we could still do those things and bring the baby along as part of our routine. But our 2-month-old struggles with everything. We’ve tried going to restaurants during quieter times like weekdays or late lunches, but she gets upset. I’ve taken her to coffee shops or just for a walk around Target, but she fusses and cries no matter what. Even walking around the neighborhood, she would start to cry.

I see other parents with their babies, and they seem so calm and content while we’re struggling to keep ours settled, even when she’s been fed and changed. We don’t have much help from family, so if we want to do anything for ourselves, we have to bring her along.

I’m wondering if anyone else is in the same boat? How do you cope with it?

I don't know how to start this other than F-CK ableism. It's the dead of night, I'm living at home, and this isn't the life I envisioned for myself. I'm in my 20s, graduated during the pandemic and as of January this year I went from being half blind to almost completely. SSDI is taking *forever*, and even when it does get to me I know it can't support me.. so I need to figure out ways to support myself.

Even though it's sometimes a slog, writing has always been a through-line and how I've provided for myself in the past. I wrote a few romance novellas in college to pay for nights out, attended an event in DC that landed me a job working as a culture writer for a bit.. but nothing ever felt permanent. This year alone I've had two surgeries in just as many months. A couple of months ago, 2 years after being diagnosed with glaucoma I was deemed medically stable.

There's a persistent struggle to obtain relevant work in a world not built for you.Every person I've spoken with basically tells me ""I want to help you, but can't"". My local options are telemarketing, customer service/retail, and working $11/h selling timeshares. I would lose money in taking those jobs.

While it is hard to make a living, it doesn't hurt to give it another shot. I don't need to make 50k a year, I just need enough to supplement whatever SSDI will pay me (which for right now is nothing, I'm living off my dwindling savings), and if it earns more then wonderful. I don't want to end up a statistic, living a solitary life at home without the means to satisfy my need to be productive.
I was watching a video by Lydia Foxglove the other day and she basically said ""publishing 40 books in 4 years ruined my health"".. Alright but  what if my eyes are already horrible? :D I can probably handle rapid reelase of novellas physically.. its the mental that I need to get a hold of.

As soon as I woke up this morning I went for a walk, where I noticed a whole family sleeping on the street right under the hotel. On my way to Starbucks I gave a poor lady 300’rupees, she then sent her daughter and I gave the young cute one 500. Then as I was having my coffee a 3rd poor lady comes and starts banging the window from outside asking for money. I had no cash at the time and told her I don’t have any money on me… she stood there banging the window for 25 mins!! I couldn’t even enjoy my coffee man…..

Apnea potentially since childhood. Failed by the NHS in the UK. Moved to Japan. Got health insurance. Polysomnography through Google Translate. AHI 21.0. Diagnosed moderate hypopnea. Auto CPAP. After 5 weeks AHI improved but not sleep quality. Diagnosed Insomnia. Dayvigo (lemborexant) pills. Waiting for MAD.


Well it's been quite a journey. I thought I would share my experience as it's probably a little unusual and helps me process it all a bit. About me - 33M, normal BMI, receding jawline, natural mouth breather, from UK but currently living in Tokyo. I have had sleep problems at least my entire adult life, and probably all my teenage years as well. I've always been told by countless people I'm the loudest snorer they ever heard. Multiple partners have said I stop breathing during sleep. I wake up at least a dozen times consciously throughout the night. I can't ever remember feeling well rested after sleep. I am always tired during the day and rely on coffee through the morning. I have memory and focus problems. History of depression. Highly educated, but lack motivation and long term ambition. Still, most would say I've achieved a considerable amount in life so far. Feels kinda like functional sleep deprivation, I've just learned to live with it.

Back home in the UK I approached multiple NHS GPs about the issue. Twice after 1-2 years on the referral waitlist to see a hospital sleep doctor, I was given the simple finger sensor apnea test to wear at home. Both times the results came back as ""negative"" after the 3-4 hours sleep I got a night and I was dismissed back to the GP. The health system just shrugged it's shoulders and cast me aside. Frustrated I just learnt to live with it.

Then last year I moved to Tokyo. I now have Japanese national health insurance through my work, which means you only pay for 30% of most private healthcare costs. I thought why not try address the situation again. I started by going to an English speaking ENT clinic. The doctor gave me the same wear at home overnight finger sensor apnea test. It came back negative again. However, this time I demanded more tests because although I'm using insurance, I'm also paying the 30% and private healthcare is happy to keep accepting your money. So, the ENT doctor referred me to the Sleep Department at a large non-english speaking private hospital in central Tokyo.

A week later I went for a consultation with the somnologist doctor. Let me highlight my Japanese is shamefully still introductory and entering a 40-floor private hospital skyscraper with no idea how the system works was bewildering to say the least. The amount of registering steps, forms, back and forth, and more forms was staggering. Thank goodness for Google Translate Sensei.

Incredibly, when I eventually stepped into the somnologist doctor's office, it turned out the hospital had, unbeknownst to me,  arranged free of charge for a member of staff (whose normal job is an international doctor liaison and conference coordinator) to be my personal translator and chaperone. So, through my translator, the doctor explained that the previous apnea test at the ENT clinic was definitely negative, but if I really insist and was willing to pay, I could have a full overnight inpatient polysomnography sleep study. The waitlist for the study was one month, but I felt I really needed to find out for certain. 

One month later, I check into the hospital for my polysomnography. My personal translator was not available, so the entire admission, explanation, and test procedure was done through Google Translate. I would say this was the closest I've come to a 'Lost In Translation' moment in Japan, but luckily in 2024 we have translate technology. Many, many forms later I was shown to my private room on the 28th floor and periodically had nurses come in to check my vitals. Something interesting that struck me was that I didn't see a single male member of staff. All the receptionists, attendants, nurses, medical students, technicians, and shift doctors that I interacted with were all female. I did have to check-in 6 hours early for no apparent reason, but it went quite fast. 

The test itself went relatively smoothly, besides a couple of times the electrodes came loose and the technician had to come wake me up to reattach them. I actually slept better than usual. The next morning I was promptly booted out at 6am with an appointment booked to see the somnologist again a few days later.

Back again, the somnologist explained the results through my translator. It showed that I did not have full obstructive sleep apnea, but instead moderate hypopnea apnea. AHI of 21.0. Mid-awakening index of 28.9 times / hour. Blood oxygen saturation 90-95%. Above average amount of time spent in stage 1 + 2 sleep with REM accounting for below average 16.9%. The hypopnea symptoms match mine almost perfectly, besides morning headaches. Partners having observed what appeared to be the complete stopping of breathing, would have instead seen extremely shallow breathing.

The doctor explained that the at home finger sensor apnea tests I had done previously in the UK and in Japan would not flag hypopnea as they are apparently measuring for full obstructive apnea only. The wave of vindication that flooded over me was immense. He then went on to say that I must leave the hospital with a CPAP machine and use it for the rest of my life. The risk of cardiovascular issues such as myocardial infarction, heart disease, and stroke is significantly higher the older I get without using a CPAP. He said it's unknown the damage that may have already been done as I've been living with it for so long but that I have age on my side. That very abruptly turned my nice feeling of vindication into tunnel vision and ringing in my ears. ""What's causing the hypopnea?"". He tells me probably the receding jaw, but they are not going to do any other tests to conclusively find out.
However, reassured CPAP use will help long term, I was told I would also be seeing him regularly for follow ups.

I was then taken to another hospital room where an official representative from Phillips was waiting with a DreamStation Auto CPAP and explained to me through the translator how to use it. It came with a size L Pico nasal mask. I explained I naturally breath through my mouth and find it difficult to breath through my nose, so would it be possible to get a full face mask instead. They said this is the only mask they have and I should use tape to keep my mouth closed. They were kind enough to at least print off the manual in English and also set the machine to English language. It has a transmitter module that automatically sends the data to Philips who share it with the hospital. I don't like the idea of a private company having my personal medical data, but it is convenient. You cannot buy the CPAP machine in Japan, but instead can only rent it at a fixed monthly fee with free maintenance cover.

I have now been using it every night for 5 weeks. Initially it was very uncomfortable and particularly difficult with just the nasal mask to breath only through my nose, which I struggle to do normally. It has gradually gotten easier. Hearing other's experiences, I was hoping that I would immediately feel some sort of positive effect through using it, but in fact I now feel even more drowsy in the mornings and no different during the days. I use the Philips DreamMapper app to monitor my stats and my AHI is averaging 3-5. 

I went back to the somnologist this week for a follow up and he was very happy with my compliance rate and average AHI score being below 5. I expressed to him I'm now very drowsy in the mornings. He said that's a common side effect. I highlighted that my sleep quality feels no different. He said the CPAP is to prevent long term health issues and not improve my sleep quality. I kinda get this, but at the same time was annoyed the sleep doctor was telling me his treatment was not concerned about improving my sleep quality. I mentioned the difficulty in breathing through the nose, he said go see the ENT doctor again. I said this is all well and good but I'm still waking up throughout the night and I'm tired during the day, to which he says ""oh well you probably have insomnia as well then, I'll give you some pills"". Dayvigo (lemborexant) 20mg / day. ""Take two if you feel like it's doing nothing. There's no physical side effect only nightmares."" Out of nowhere and so casually I get told I ""probably"" have insomnia on top of hypopnea and just take pills.

This is very typical of all doctor experiences I've had in Japan and what other expats also report. There seems to be no desire to figure out the root cause of an issue, only treat the symptoms. Always quick to prescribe pills for a maximum of two months at a time and regular ongoing appointments for the same prescriptions without ever addressing the root cause. It keeps the clients and money returning I guess. I'm not saying Japan's healthcare system is bad, but it's not great. However, generally the hospital and care I received through my apnea journey have been to a pretty high standard. 

This week, not being entirely happy with still being tired all the time, I did some reading on this subreddit. I have now bypassed the CPAP lock, increased the pressure to 5.5 and turned the CFlex option on which makes exhaling a lot easier. My AHI the last few nights is now 1.5 down from 4-5. The pills seem to be stopping me from waking up as much. My dreams have certainly been more vivid.

I also mentioned I don't want to carry the CPAP when I go on trips, so the somnologist referred me to the hospital sleep dentist who will now take moulds for the MAD gumshield device. I have a choice between the insurance covered fixed chunk of plastic, or the significantly more expensive uninsured flexible SomnoDent Avant at 14X the cost. Need to make the decision by next week. Going back to the ENT doctor tomorrow, hypopnea diagnosis in hand, and will see if he can improve my nose breathing.

So that's my journey so far. It's been far from easy, especially with the language barrier and lack of knowledge how the system works in Japan, but it does feel like at least some progress is being made. It's also definitely made me realise that back in the UK the NHS, which I've had faith in all my life, can no longer be relied upon and failed me massively. 

Happy to receive advice and answer any questions. If anyone has tried SomnoDent I'd also like to hear from you.

That said, I made the decision to go to the gym and workout with the objective of building muscle (athletic build). My body type is ectomorph and I have a hyper-metabolic condition.

I have a business and knowing I have ADHD, I spend very little time (if not none) thinking about nothing that has anything to do with work not to disrupt my momentum.

Never been the workout type and I wouldn't say I like the gym; however, I've been told that if you do not eat, you simply cannot build muscle.

This brings me to my question: What strategies including but not limited to, calendars, reminders, family, notes, Siri, etc., do you use to eat? If I aim to become successful I need to make sure to eat.

When you don't eat, what do you consume as an alternative and does it suffice?

My girlfriend made breakfast yesterday and I had to force myself to eat half of what she made. I started in the afternoon, and spent hours eating half and I threw away the rest.

TLDR; Adderall and work make it impossible for me to eat, I want to workout to build muscle, but I have a dilemma because I do not eat until nighttime. Any suggestions on how to make it easier for me to eat?",1,1729743696.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

1gau9nx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TikTokCreatorSecrets/comments/1gau9nx/feel_like_tiktoks_working_against_you_heres_how/,Feel like TikTok's working against you? Here’s how to make it work.,"So, anyone else feel like TikTok is *seriously* working against them? One day your videos are popping off, the next… nothing. You’re putting out decent content, engagement is solid, but the earnings? Barely enough to grab a coffee. And then there’s the RPM drops, random account fluctuations, disappearing features—it’s like the platform is constantly messing with you.

Here’s what I’ve figured out and what led to making over $10k the past two months alone:

1. **Diversify your content and products.** You can’t rely on just one video or product to carry you. Mix it up—try trending products, niche stuff, different video formats. The more variety you give your audience, the better chance you have of keeping things steady. It's easy to get stuck on one content format. Dial in your hooks, and make sure people are watching past the first 1-3 seconds.
2. **Adapt quickly to new features.** TikTok is always changing things up, and it sucks when they take away stuff we rely on. But, if you jump on the new tools they roll out early, they tend to push that content harder. Basically, ride the wave as soon as it shows up.
3. **Use your analytics.** Posting more doesn’t always mean better results—posting *smarter* does. Dig into your analytics and see which videos are performing best. Then, make more of that type of content. Watch time and completion rates are key here. Once you see what works, stick to it. Look at what other creators are doing, and replicate it in your own way.

TikTok is pretty unpredictable, but your strategy doesn’t have to be. Keep experimenting, stay flexible, and use the platform’s changes to your advantage. It’s not about luck—it’s about knowing how to adjust.

Anyone else riding the TikTok rollercoaster? How are you handling it?",1,1729743625.0,TikTokCreatorSecrets,1,0.67,False

I was recently diagnosed after an upper endoscopy due to having great difficulties swallowing. I put myself on a soft and restricted diet for a few weeks leading up to the endoscopy.

I haven't heard back from my doctor yet, but will have a follow up upper endoscopy in two months. I'm on omeprazole for now. 

Did anyone have any favorite snacks/meals to eat that helped reduce symptoms? I've been avoiding acidic foods, onions, garlic, chocolate, alcohol, caffeine (coffee). 

Did anyone have surgery for their hiatal hernia while doing CICO? If so how did this impact you, positively or negatively?

Just looking for anyone's experiences, and appreciate any input. Thank you! ",1,1729743615.0,CICO,0,1.0,False
1gau882,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1gau882/life_is_a_big_joke/,Life is a big joke 👎,"I feel soo frustrated and lowkey anxious ? right now. I just turned 19 last week and I also just graduated high school almost 6 months ago now. 

I cannot for the life of me figure out a career path. And although I’ve had so many people tell me it’s “okay” to not have everything figured out right now - simultaneously I’ve had others tell me that I’m 19 (or at the time they said I was almost 19) and needed to start figuring things out and what I’m going to do with my life. 

I feel so stressed and pressured right now. I’ve done so much research and can’t find anything realistic to study. If I went with what I was passionate about - I’d choose to be an English major. Or even entrepreneurship so I could own my own bookstore or coffee shop. Which - none of these things are really convenient in terms of paying the bills. 

I absolutely despise STEM related fields, especially science. Was never good at them. And honestly I feel so….depressed, is the best way I could put it. Because it seems like STEM and healthcare related careers are the only in-demand decent paying jobs.  

If I choose what I’m passionate about to study, I’ll have to live with struggling financially. If I choose to study something more convenient, I’ll have to sacrifice my happiness and well-being. 

All my friends are in college or have figured out their plans. I have a friend who just graduated with an associates degree in astrophysics and are going onto their bachelors. A friend studying vet medicine. Another in cosmetology. 

I feel so torn and stuck. I don’t even know how to explore other options when everything requires an actual degree or experience. Sometimes I can’t help but think that I’d literally rather not live at all than live so miserably. I know it’s such a grim way to look at things. I feel like a big crybaby for thinking this way. But things just feel so rigged. 

I’m the first on both family sides to graduate highschool and I’d be the first to attend college as well. (Aside from like 2-3 cousins) I’m so scared of choosing the wrong thing and ending up with a low-paying job. So I can’t help but look at salaries when choosing a path.
