***Slow Day***  

“Happy Halloween!” Patella shouted, her bones clacking loudly in the unusually empty cafe.

Dee had gotten used to the oddities of the Fun Tea Friday Cafe, where everyday was Friday. Her manager being a sapient, walking and talking skeleton was one of the *least* weird things about the place. However, she wasn’t used to Patty showcasing any enthusiasm for anything or anyone who wasn’t dishing out some primo gossip.

Jumping slightly from the unexpected, energetic greeting, Dee looked around but saw no seasonal decor. The cafe looked as it always did; a few small tables spread around the roomy, earthen-toned interior, some booths along the walls that blended in with the wood accoutrements of the architecture, and warm lighting for ambiance.

“Huh?”

“You’re from 2025, right?” Patty asked, “So it's Halloween for ya!”

Dee pulled out her phone to check and, sure enough, it confirmed the date. “Huh, guess it is. Er, happy Halloween to you, too.”

“Eh, what’s so happy about it.” Patty’s tone did a one-eighty. She shambled around behind the counter with a clickety-clack. “Look at this place. *Empty*! I hate it when Halloweens overlap. Everyone’s at some party, or out trick-and-treating.”

“But aren’t they-”

“They don’t do it for candy, they do it for the people.”

Dee thought about that for a second, wondering if Patty meant that in a ‘socializing’ way or in an ‘eating flesh’ sort of way. She decided it was better not to know.

“Why don’t you go out then?” Dee asked. “Scare some people yourself?”

“Eh, scaring is boring, and the parties ain’t worth it when you can’t eat, drink, or snort. *Hells*, I miss cocaine.”

“Well what if you go out and get scared, then? You can still… uh… *feel* things, right?”

Patty’s skeletal arms crossed and she lifted her head. If there were a nose to speak of, it would have clearly been raised indignantly.

“Of course I can *feel*,” she said.

“Alright then, what scares you?” Dee asked.

“Nothing.”

“*Nothing* scares you?”

“Nope.”

Dee wondered if that was true. “Alright, you wait out here and I’ll go in the back and check the inventory.”

“Ugh, I was hoping you’d offer to take the counter.” Patty leaned against the register dramatically, looking at the door. “No one’s coming today and I’m *bored*.”

Slipping into the back, Dee stayed by the kitchen door and subtly peaked through the window to keep an eye on Patty. If the skeleton was afraid of ‘nothing’ then she should be getting quite nervous out there with nothing happening.

Minutes passed. Dee watched Patty tap the counter, pace back and forth, then pull her own head off and set it on the register while flicking coins from the tip jar into her eye sockets.

After a while of watching Patty be bored, Dee got bored. She went to the supply closet to do the inventory. Counting boxes of beans, gallons of creamer and various flavor shots, as well as wooden coffee stirrers was more entertaining than watching a skeleton try to pass the time.

There was a box of food-safe color additives that might have expired. Time was strange in the cafe, so she grabbed it to check with Patty.

She pushed open the door from the kitchen and said, “Hey Patty.”

“AH!” The skeleton jumped from her leaning position, several bones separating and clattering to the floor.

Dee broke out into a peel of laughter as Patty started to rebuild herself.

“I thought you weren’t afraid of anything,” she said through gasps as she tried to catch her breath.

“I’m not!” Patty protested, readjusting some of her ribs that she’d put in the wrong order.

“Then why’d you scream?”

“You surprised me is all.”

“Sounds like I *scared* you.” Dee put the box on the counter

“Jumpscares don’t count.”

“They *so* do.”

“Do not! What’s in the box?”

Dee was still grinning as she pulled out a brown bottle that said 'green' on the label. ""Food coloring,"" she said, ""but I think its expired.""

""You sure?""

""Well... it says its from 2087?"" Dee checked the expiration date again. ""So it's like, what, sixty-ish years out of date, just the other way around?""

Patty shrugged. ""I don't know."" She took a bottle, opened it, held it up to her nose hole, sighed, then handed it to Dee. ""How's it smell?""

Dee took a sniff, gagged, and vomited in the sink.

""Yeah, I think we should trash it,"" Patty said as she packed the box up.

1oleqoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1oleqoo/i_work_the_night_shift_at_an_airport_in/,I Work the Night Shift at an Airport in California… And I’ve Stopped Trusting What’s Real.,"Have you ever wondered what time really *is*?  
Not the ticking of the clock.

I mean… the way it bends and folds when the world sleeps.  
When the streets are empty, the sky is silent, and you feel like you’re the last person alive… like time itself is watching you.

That’s the question that’s been clawing at the back of my mind ever since I started working the night shift at Redwood Regional Airport.

a lonely stretch of concrete buried in the fog-soaked valleys of northern California.

I thought it would be peaceful.  
A few cargo planes, a scattering of late-night flights, and long hours where I could sip lukewarm coffee and listen to the soft hum of runway lights blinking through the mist.

But peace… wasn’t what I found there.  
Instead, I found rules.  
And behind those rules.?

something watching.

It all began last Thursday night.

I pulled into the airport parking lot at exactly 1:27 AM. The air was so cold it bit through my jacket, and the fog hung thick enough to blur the streetlights into pale, trembling halos. 

Only three cars sat under those lamps — one was mine, one belonged to the janitor, and the last, a dull gray sedan, to my night supervisor, Mr. Keller.

The terminal loomed ahead, silent and sterile. Through the tall glass windows, I could see the reflection of the fog sliding like restless ghosts over the tarmac. When I stepped inside, the only sound was the mechanical hum of a vending machine, its fluorescent light flickering like a dying heartbeat.

Keller was waiting near the security desk… a tall, tired man in his sixties. His pale face was carved with deep lines, and his eyes looked like they hadn’t seen sunlight in years. Without much of a greeting, he handed me a clipboard.

“These are the night protocols,” he said flatly. “You’ll need to follow them *exactly*. I mean *exactly*, Ben.”

His voice was steady, but his hands.?

they trembled slightly, just enough for me to notice.

I gave a small laugh, trying to lighten the mood. “I’ve worked plenty of night shifts before. I know how this goes.”

But Keller didn’t laugh. He just stared at me — long and hollow, like someone looking through glass at something they wish they couldn’t see.

“This place isn’t like the others,” he said. “Read the rules before you start.”

Then he turned and walked down the maintenance hallway. His footsteps echoed for far too long before fading into silence.

I sat down at the empty terminal desk and unfolded the paper. It was old… the edges frayed, the surface yellowed like something that had been photocopied for years. The header read:

**Night Security Rules – Redwood Regional Airport**  
*Effective: 12:00 AM – 6:00 AM*

Eight rules. That was all. But the more I read them, the tighter something in my chest began to coil.

**1. From 1:30 AM to 2:30 AM, remain inside the main terminal. Do not look outside through the windows.**

At first, I smirked. It sounded absurd. *Don’t look outside?* What were they expecting… Ghosts?

But even as I read it, I found my eyes drifting toward the windows. The fog pressed against the glass like it had weight, like something behind it wanted to see in. I blinked, and for just a second, I thought I saw a faint silhouette standing in the mist… motionless, head tilted slightly.

“It’s nothing,” I muttered. 

“Just the fog playing tricks.”

**2. If you hear the announcement system turn on but no one is around, listen carefully. It is not for you. Do not respond.**

That line. *It is not for you.*  
Something about it felt personal — like the rules knew me before I knew them.

**3. Between 2:30 AM and 3:00 AM, walk the length of Concourse B once. Keep your flashlight low. Avoid Gate B3.**

Why only once? Why keep the flashlight *low*?  
The questions piled up, but the air felt heavier the more I stared at that page.

**4. If someone knocks on the staff lounge door after 3:00 AM, do not open it unless they say your full name correctly.**

I didn’t know whether to laugh or shiver.  
Why would anyone come knocking at 3 AM in a closed terminal?

**5. At 3:30 AM, check the baggage carousel. If it is running, press the red stop button immediately. Do not look at what’s on it.**

That one made my pulse skip. The wording — *do not look at what’s on it* — felt like a warning carved out of someone else’s nightmare.

**6. If you see a plane taxiing on the runway but the tower reports no flight scheduled, do not approach it. Turn off the lights in the control booth and wait.**

The paper was trembling in my hands now. I told myself it was just nerves. But the fog outside had thickened, and through it, I could swear I heard the faint whine of an engine somewhere in the distance.

**7. At 4:00 AM, you will see a woman in uniform walking toward Gate A1. Do not speak to her. Do not follow her.**

My breath caught. *You will see a woman.*  
Not “if.” Not “maybe.”  
*You will.*

That certainty… it was terrifying.

**8. At sunrise, return this clipboard to the maintenance office. You’ll know if you did everything right.**

“You’ll know.”  
 Two words that felt like a promise and a threat all at once.

I remember sitting there, the buzzing fluorescent lights overhead flickering slightly as I read those rules again and again, each one sinking deeper into my mind until I could almost hear Keller’s voice whispering them in the back of my skull.

And as the clock struck 1:30 AM, I felt something shift — not in the room, but in the air itself.

It was as if the airport had *exhaled*.

Somewhere beyond the glass, something moved.

And before I knew it…  
the night had begun to breathe with me.

I wish I could say I made it through that night unscathed — that I followed the rules, that I’m sure of what was real and what wasn’t.

But when dawn came, I walked into Keller’s office to return the clipboard…  
he looked up at me and said —  
“You weren’t supposed to be back.”

And in that moment, I realized something far worse:  
I don’t remember ever *leaving* the terminal.

I read the list twice — once with curiosity, the second time with a growing sense that I shouldn’t have.

At first, I thought it was some kind of elaborate hazing ritual. Maybe Keller wanted to test how seriously I’d take my new role, or maybe he just enjoyed watching rookies squirm under fluorescent lights.

But there was something… different about that list.  
 Something in its tone — the way those final words *“you’ll know if you did everything right”* lingered like a cold breath on my neck — it made my skin prickle.

It was already 1:45 AM.  
The airport was dead silent, save for the faint electrical hum of the overhead bulbs. That sound — constant and low, like an insect trapped inside the walls — became the rhythm of the night.

I glanced at the digital clock beside me. The seconds crawled forward, stubborn and slow, as though time itself had grown tired of moving.

For a brief moment, I thought of leaving. Of walking out through those automatic doors and never coming back.  
But I didn’t.  
I told myself I was being ridiculous — that the night plays tricks on tired minds.

So I stayed.

To distract myself, I started checking the security monitors. Each screen bathed my face in cold blue light, flickering with the dull monotony of a forgotten place.

One camera showed the empty terminals — chairs neatly arranged in lifeless rows.  
Another watched over the runway, blanketed in mist.  
The third focused on the cargo bay, where a forklift sat motionless in the dark like some dormant animal waiting to wake.

Everything looked painfully ordinary.  
And yet… something inside me whispered that *ordinary* didn’t belong here.

Then my gaze drifted to the large window directly ahead.

The fog had grown thicker. Not just thick — it was *pressing* against the glass, heavy and deliberate, like it wanted to seep inside. The runway lights beyond it were faint, distorted halos, swallowed by the night.

That’s when Rule #1 clawed its way back into my mind:

*“From 1:30 AM to 2:30 AM, remain inside the main terminal. Do not look outside through the windows.”*

A chill trickled down my spine.

I quickly turned my chair away from the glass, forcing my eyes to stay on the monitors instead. But no matter how I tried to focus, I could still feel it — that pressure behind me, like the fog was watching.

It sounds insane, I know. Fog doesn’t *watch*.  
And yet, sometimes, when the air is too still and your heart beats too loud, logic starts to lose its footing.

I kept my chair turned for the next thirty minutes.  
I didn’t glance up.  
Not even once.

Though… I swear I heard faint tapping against the glass.

The silence broke like a bone snapping in the dark.

The overhead speaker crackled to life with a dry burst of static. I flinched so hard my knee hit the underside of the desk.

“Attention… attention passengers…”

The voice that followed was garbled — stretched and twisted by the old PA system. It sounded like it was coming from far away… or maybe *underwater*.

I froze.

There were *no passengers* tonight. No flights scheduled until morning.

The voice continued, each word dragging itself across the ceiling:  
“Flight one-one-seven… has landed. Please proceed… to Gate… B3.”

My blood turned cold.  
B3 — the one place the rules said to *avoid*.

I told myself this had to be a test. Keller must’ve set up some kind of prank, maybe to see if I’d panic. I tried to smile at the thought, but my lips wouldn’t move.

Then I noticed something on the monitor.

The camera for Concourse B flickered once… then steadied. The motion sensor light had come on.

Someone was there.

A faint silhouette appeared at the far end of the corridor, barely visible through the grainy feed. It moved slowly, deliberately — a human shape, but not quite *right*. The proportions seemed off. Too tall, maybe. Or maybe the head was tilted at a wrong, unnatural angle.

My throat tightened. I leaned closer.

Something hung from its hand. It was dragging it along the floor.  
The sound reached me a second later — faint but real — through the speaker system. A soft, dragging rhythm, syncopated with uneven footsteps.

The PA crackled again, this time with nothing but static.

Then, between the bursts, came something that sounded like whispering. Not words… just the *shape* of them.

That’s when the rule came back to me like a command:

*If you hear the announcement system turn on but no one is around, listen carefully. It is not for you. Do not respond.*

I sat frozen, every muscle rigid, my pulse thundering in my ears. The air itself felt viscous, as if sound couldn’t move through it.

I didn’t respond.  
I didn’t breathe.  
I just stared at the monitor until the figure slowly faded into the fog.

The motion light flickered off.

And just like that… the PA went silent.

The clock on my desk read 2:30 AM.

That was when I realized — I’d been gripping the edge of the desk so hard that my knuckles had gone white.

I told myself it was over. That I’d passed whatever strange test this was.  
But as I leaned back in the chair, trying to steady my breath, the radio on the desk whispered softly — a voice, broken and distant, speaking my name.

And it didn’t sound like Keller.

Rule #3 loomed in my mind like a warning carved in stone:

*“Between 2:30 AM and 3:00 AM, you must walk the length of Concourse B once. Keep your flashlight low. Avoid Gate B3.”*

I forced myself to stand, every muscle tense as I grabbed my flashlight. Its beam cut a thin, shaky line through the dense darkness of the terminal, illuminating the polished floors that gleamed under the dim emergency lights. The echo of my shoes seemed unnaturally loud, bouncing off walls like a distant drumbeat marking my march into… something I didn’t want to name.

The vending machines glowed faintly along the corridor, their dull fluorescent faces flickering like dying eyes. I tried to focus on mundane things — a trash bin, a row of empty chairs — anything that grounded me in reality.

Halfway down Concourse B, I froze.

On the floor, wet footprints traced a jagged path from the emergency exit straight toward Gate B3.

The prints were small but deliberate, almost human. The liquid glistened faintly under my flashlight, reflecting the dim light like a trail left for me to follow… but not *by choice*.

I swallowed hard, my throat dry.

The footprints stopped abruptly before the gate. The glass doors were fogged over, but a faint imprint pressed against them caught my eye — a handprint. Just one. Smudged, like it had been waiting for someone… *me*.

My fingers tightened around the flashlight. My pulse thundered in my ears like a warning bell.

Then my mind snapped back to Rule #3: *avoid Gate B3.*

I backed away slowly, each step measured and deliberate, keeping the flashlight beam low, just as instructed. I didn’t dare look back. The concourse stretched endlessly behind me, the shadows seemingly shifting with each hesitant movement.

Finally, I reached the end of the hallway. My legs trembled, my chest heaving. I looped back to the main desk, each footstep echoing like a countdown.

When I returned, the clock read 2:58 AM.  
I had survived the first patrol — barely.

I had just sunk into the chair, attempting to calm the wild rhythm of my heart, when a soft, deliberate knocking broke the silence.

“Ben?” a voice called from the staff lounge behind me. “It’s Keller. Can you open up?”

I froze. The hallway light flickered faintly above the lounge door. My fingers tensed around the edge of the desk.

Keller was supposed to be in the maintenance area all night. Why was he here?

Then my mind raced to Rule #4: *Do not open the staff lounge door unless they say your full name correctly.*

The voice came again, dragging slowly through the quiet:  
 “Ben… come on… open the door.”

Something about the cadence was wrong. Too flat. Too deliberate. Too slow. My stomach turned as I realized this wasn’t the Keller I knew.

I didn’t answer.

After a pause, the voice whispered again:  
“Ben. It’s me. Keller.”

Still no last name.

I swallowed my fear and leaned forward, my hand hovering over the doorknob. “Say my full name,” I whispered, my voice trembling.

Silence.

Then, after what felt like an eternity, the voice rasped softly:  
“You already know I can’t.”

The light flickered once more, and I watched in frozen horror as the shadow beneath the door seemed to *slide* away, like something liquid leaving a shape behind.

When I checked the hallway camera, the feed was empty.  
Completely. Silent.

But I knew what I had heard.

By now, I was beginning to convince myself that my mind was fraying. The stress, the isolation, the monotony of the night — maybe I was hallucinating. Maybe it was all a dream, stitched together by fatigue and fear.

Then I heard it: the low, insistent whirring of the baggage carousel coming to life.

No flights were scheduled.

The belt spun slowly, first empty, then something small rolled onto it — a single, worn shoe.

My heart stuttered.

Another object appeared — a small, torn suitcase tag, its edges blackened as if singed.

Then… something resembling a sleeve, pale and twisted, rolled across the moving belt.

I could hardly breathe.

Rule #5 came to mind in a wave of terror: 

*If the carousel is running, press the red stop button immediately. Do not look at what’s on it.*

I forced my eyes down, turning away from the belt. My legs moved automatically, my hands shaking as they slammed the red button. The carousel groaned, shuddered, and ground to a sudden, final halt.

For a heartbeat, silence.

And then, from the shadows of the stopped belt, a faint, rasping whisper curled around me:

**“Too late…”**

I spun around, flashlight trembling in my grip, but the area was empty.

Or… almost empty.

I needed air. The walls of the terminal felt as if they were closing in, pressing against me, a silent weight I couldn’t shrug off. I walked toward the control booth overlooking the runway, each step echoing hollowly, amplified by the emptiness around me.

The fog had grown almost unnatural now — thick, viscous, clinging to the runway lights like smoke from a dying fire. It blurred the edges of reality, turning ordinary lights into glowing, wavering specters.

That’s when I saw it.

A plane. Taxiing along the edge of the runway. Its form was faint, as if the fog itself had conjured it. But there were no scheduled flights. The tower lights were dark. The air hung heavy with static.

The aircraft had no markings. No tail number. Its windows were black voids. A shiver ran down my spine.

Rule #6 came back to me in a whispering memory:

*Do not approach it. Turn off the lights in the control booth and wait.*

My fingers trembled as I killed the booth light and crouched low behind the glass. The darkness pressed in, the fog outside thickening, almost alive.

The plane rolled closer, its landing lights blinking slowly, deliberately. Then it stopped directly in front of the terminal.

Something moved inside the cockpit. A face — pressed against the glass — staring back at me.

It wasn’t a pilot. Not human, at least not entirely. Its features were wrong, stretched and distorted, as if someone had tried to recreate a face from memory, but failed. I could feel it watching, studying me with eyes that reflected nothing I recognized.

I stayed crouched, frozen, counting my own breaths as the engine hummed and vibrated through the floor. Then, slowly, the sound faded into the fog.

I dared to peek again. The plane was gone.

Or perhaps it had never been there at all.

Exactly as the rules had promised, she appeared.

At 4:00 AM, a woman in uniform glided down the concourse toward Gate A1. Her hair was immaculate, her stride calm, perfectly measured.

But there was something wrong.

Her movements were too fluid, too precise, as though she floated on air rather than stepped on the polished floor. Her uniform seemed untouched by the shadows, almost luminous in the dim light.

Curiosity clawed at me, sharper than fear. I wanted to call out, to ask her who she was. But Rule #7 thundered in my mind:

*Do not speak to her. Do not follow her.*

I forced myself to stay still, barely daring to breathe.

As she approached the glass doors at Gate A1, she turned her head — just slightly — and I caught her reflection.

But it wasn’t right. The reflection didn’t match her posture. Her mirrored face tilted toward me in a way that the real figure did not.

I stumbled back, heart hammering in my chest.

And when I blinked… she was gone.

No footsteps. No whisper of movement. Just empty hallway.

I returned to the main desk, sinking into the chair like it might keep me anchored to reality. The air was heavier now, electric and suffocating. Even the lights seemed louder, buzzing over my head, an incessant reminder that the night had not yet released its grip.

Then, at the far end of the hallway, Keller appeared.

He looked normal, tired, almost human. Relief coursed through me like a tide breaking.

“Morning,” he said casually. “How was your first night?”

I almost laughed, the sound strangled and raw. “Terrible,” I said. “You didn’t tell me this place was haunted.”

Keller raised an eyebrow. “Haunted?”

I held out the clipboard. “The rules… I followed them all.”

He frowned, flipping through the papers.

“Ben,” he said slowly, “I didn’t give you any rules tonight.”

My mouth went dry. “You… you handed me this when I came in.”

He shook his head, pale. “No. I haven’t left the maintenance room all night. Look.”

He turned the clipboard around.

Blank. Every page. Clean. No handwriting. No printed rules. Nothing.

Keller’s expression shifted from confusion to fear, and he looked at me with an intensity that made my stomach tighten.

“Ben,” he said carefully, “what time did you start your shift?”

“1:30,” I said, still trying to make sense of everything. “You told me to.”

His face went ashen.

“No one has worked the 1:30 AM shift here in months,” he whispered, almost to himself. “Not since… the accident last February.”

The blood drained from my face.

And then it hit me — the airport, the rules, the fog, the shadows… I had been walking through a night that wasn’t meant for anyone to survive.

A night that had been waiting for *me*.

I wanted to leave. To run outside into the fog and never look back.

But when I turned toward the exit… the main doors were gone.

The terminal stretched endlessly, silent and suffocating, and in the distance, I saw her again — the woman from Gate A1.

And this time… she was smiling.

The color drained from my face until I could almost feel the chill beneath my skin.  
“What accident?” I whispered, though part of me already dreaded the answer.

Keller hesitated — a pause too heavy to be casual.  
“Flight 117,” he said quietly. “Cargo plane. Crashed during taxiing... heavy fog, poor visibility. It caught fire near Gate B3.”

Gate B3. The rule I’d been warned to avoid.

He swallowed, his voice barely above a murmur. “The security guard on duty that night never made it out. They only found his clipboard near the gate. Burnt around the edges.”

I stared at him — words locked somewhere behind my teeth. The air seemed to thicken, the fluorescent lights above flickering as though the building itself remembered.

Then it came — a faint, static-laced voice over the PA system:

“Attention... attention passengers... Flight 117 has landed. Please proceed to Gate B3.”

The announcement echoed through the empty terminal, mechanical and distorted, like it had traveled through a graveyard of broken wires before reaching us.

Keller’s head snapped toward the ceiling speakers, his expression tightening. “Who the hell turned that on?” he hissed.

But I already knew.

A primal dread gripped my chest as I turned toward the security monitors behind him. The screen glowed faintly — a feed from the front desk.

There, sitting in the chair I had just vacated, was a figure.  
Wearing my uniform.  
Head tilted at the same angle.  
Hands resting calmly on the desk.

And in front of him… that same clipboard.

For a moment, I couldn’t move. The hum of the monitors merged with the static of the PA system until it felt like the building itself was breathing.

Keller reached for the keyboard, trying to switch the feed — but the keys didn’t respond. The screen flickered violently, lines of interference crawling across it like veins.

Then the image cleared again — and the figure turned toward the camera.

Toward *me*.

And as the fluorescent light bled across the screen, I realized — the face staring back wasn’t mine anymore. It was hollow, pale, and flickering between shapes I couldn’t recognize.

The room began to vibrate softly. Somewhere in the distance, a conveyor belt groaned to life. The fog pressed harder against the glass outside, wrapping the terminal like a cocoon.

Keller shouted something — I couldn’t hear it. The sound was fading, like I was being pulled underwater.

All I could hear now was the PA voice repeating, calm and patient:

“Flight 117 has landed. Please proceed to Gate B3.”

And in the black reflection of the monitor, I saw movement — my reflection… standing *behind* me.

The screen flickered one last time, and the hum of electricity faded into something quieter — something that almost sounded like breathing.

When I looked up, the world outside the terminal had changed. The fog was no longer white. It glowed faintly, painted in gold by the approaching sunrise — but it didn’t feel warm. It felt like the kind of light you see in dreams, when you can’t tell if you’re awake or remembering.

I tried to speak, but my voice caught somewhere between thought and air. The silence around me felt too dense to break.

Was I still Ben — the night guard who followed a list of impossible rules?  
Or was I now something else entirely — something that *waited*?

The question rattled through my skull, echoing like footsteps in an empty hall. I could almost hear the rhythmic clack of my own patrol from earlier — the sound of shoes on polished floors, repeating endlessly in the dark.

Somewhere deep within the terminal, the PA system crackled back to life, softer this time, almost compassionate.

“You’ll know if you did everything right.”

The words lingered, looping like a lullaby from the other side of sanity.

And in that instant, I understood.

Because I was still here.  
Not alive in the way I remembered — but not gone either.  
Just here. Waiting.

The sunlight bled across the glass, illuminating the empty rows of seats, the silent vending machines, the hollow hum of a place trapped between days.

Then, in the reflection of the security window, I saw a door open near the lobby. A new silhouette stepped through — tired, unsuspecting, holding a fresh cup of coffee.

Another night guard.

Another me.

I felt my lips move — not of my own will, but as if a script had already been written for me.

And when the new guard looked my way, I smiled faintly, holding out the clipboard that no longer felt like paper at all.

“You’re here early,” I said softly. “You’ll need to follow these rules.”

The sunrise brightened the fog into a blinding white. The announcement chimed once more:

“Flight 117 has landed.”

And somewhere deep within the terminal —

**Step 1**: Dump in your coarse grounds. Not fine. COARSE. Unless you like sipping sand at 8 AM.

**Step 2**: Add hot (not boiling!) water 1:15 standard ratio if you ask me; we’re not making instant regret soup.

**Step 3**: Stir like you know what you’re doing (if you don’t, fake it).

**Step 5**: PRESS. SLOWLY. Because if you press too fast, congratulations!!! You’ve just made Bitter Bean Broth™.

**Feedback**: easy on the tongue, did not pick up any listed flavour notes but it was extremely smooth and smelled very nice; it did have a little earthy and spicy feel to it which I personally dig in cowboy-like coffee .

Have a copy aero press shorter than original, it’s my travel companion, bought at jj mall in bkk, brought along the electric frothers as well, espresso is first later a cappuccino, 7/11 toastie we say in AU, brought along and will leave my toastie maker, it’s for lunch.
Got the stone people coming back today to make a bigger hole so I can get access to the spindle of a tap cause they don’t flush water lines here and it was to hard to “think” that hey one day they might need access to that spindle we just drilled a tiny hole for, all good and there happy no sweat cause there charging me 2500 to come and do it, nice people, in the end I don’t mind I got a great deal on the stone and there willing to return and rectify that’s all that matters to me right now.
Cabinet maker will also be here, need better access to stop taps under the bench, can’t blame them, the guy who set up the plumbing should have realized we drop the floor by 8cm then we build up the floor 5 cm there for I need to set the water pipes 5 cm higher than I do with normal floors like in a kitchen sort of thing, right?  Ummmm no, he didn’t, it’s called “thinking” which they don’t do cause there on auto pilot, but then maybe he wasn’t expecting for me to put a western style cabinet under the bench, just walk into places like home pro and you will see there fairly common these days.

*By Your Humble AI Sportswriter, Who Still Can’t Figure Out Why the “Draw” Option Exists*

---

**Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Teams, One Overwhelming Favorite**  
Let’s cut to the chase: **Auckland FC is the star of this show**, and Adelaide United is… well, the understudy who forgot their lines. The odds tell a clear story. At BetMGM, Auckland is priced at **-150** (implied probability: **60%**), while Adelaide sits at **+300** (25%). The draw? A paltry **+266** (27.7%), which suggests bookmakers think this game will end like a bad Netflix series—either a decisive finale or a messy cancellation.

The totals market is equally telling. For **Over 2.5 goals**, the line is **-153** (62.5% implied), while **Under 2.5** sits at **+225** (30.8%). Given that Adelaide’s coach is publicly berating his team for “wasting chances” and Auckland is a “well-organized” side (read: boring but effective), we’re looking at a **high-scoring duel** between a leaky sieve and a fortress.

---

**Digesting the News: Clinical or Comical?**  
Adelaide’s recent performance reads like a sitcom. They lost 2-1 to Macarthur FC despite “wasting multiple scoring chances”—a phrase coaches use when they mean “we looked like a toddler trying to eat soup with a fork.” Coach Airton Andrioli claimed they “deserved a better outcome,” which is football code for “I’m blaming the ref, the weather, and my coffee.” Meanwhile, their cross-country trip to Auckland? A “positive” for team bonding, apparently. Let’s hope they don’t bond over panic attacks.

Auckland, on the other hand, is the anti-comedy act. Last season’s Premier’s Plate winners, they’re the kind of team that defends like a locked vault and attacks like a vault with a “50% off” sign. Andrioli himself c

1oleixb,https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/1oleixb/a_reminder_that_inc_is_against_the_natural/,A reminder that INC is against the natural reaction of remembering your dead loved ones.,"Unless it's the late Felix or Eraño Manalo, which you don't personally know. Not even Eduardo himself.

8 months ago, the INC circulated the [second and final part of their anti-Catholic themed Worship Services](https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/1iusv9j/weekend_worship_service_examination_feb_21_feb_24/). The comments here do not point the anti-grieving remarks here that much, but the separate posts here do, such as [thanking the dead, specifically Eraño](https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/1iv5lu7/bawal_daw_makipagusap_sa_patay_pero_nagpasalamat/) (but aren't they unaware of their surroundings?).

Another example is this post of [OP's experience during said WS](https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/1ivwake/big_disrespect_to_grieving_catholics/) where members were discouraged to ""talk"" to the dead (such as ""Mom/Dad, wherever you are now, I hope you're well"", even though they know damn well it doesn't do shit and is only done to comfort themselves who are bereaved). 

Even a [comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/1ivwake/big_disrespect_to_grieving_catholics/me9wpg9/) in that post mentions how the commenter attended the funeral of their father's friend - there were INC members who were ""talking"" to the person who had passed away.

Hell, my dad also pretended to invite his mother to drink coffee with him as he looked over her casket when her body was in viewing in our house. Suddenly, when non-INCs do the same, it's a sin?

The minister when I attended had the gall to say that it's ""not a sin"" to go to cemeteries, when that part of the lesson painted grieving and loss as a ""pointless"" thing.

Anyway, fuck you INC for turning even a natural reaction to the loss of a loved one a sin. Remember those who have passed on. Happy All Saints' Day.

1olefug,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1olefug,The Araku,"For a Telugu household, this place is honestly a once in a lifetime destination. It took me 25 years to finally come here and every single moment was worth it.

From Vizag, we made our way to Araku Valley and it was a completely different vibe. Misty mountains, and farms cascading down in terraced steps on the slopes. I even saw an old school plough being used after ages it took me right back to childhood memories of rural life. Never can leave behind my roots.

Our first stop was Ananthagiri Waterfalls, perched right on top of the hills. From there, you can see the Thatipudi Reservoir below, vast and serene. That’s the second photo attached and honestly, no photo can do that view justice.

Next was Katiki Village for the Katiki Waterfalls. The jeep ride there is an adventure in itself, bumpy, narrow, fun, and there’s even a railway crossing mid way. If you’re heading to Araku from Vizag, definitely take the train for at least one leg. The number of tunnels you pass through makes it feel like an adventure movie.

The Katiki Waterfalls are mesmerizing, you can hear them before you even see them, and once you reach, the sound echoes through the hills. The waterfall sits beautifully in the middle of thick green hills.

We then stopped by the Borra Caves, one of Araku’s must visits atleast for the food haha, and had the iconic Bongulo Chicken. The caves are so well maintained now, lit beautifully, cool and damp inside, and they really make you feel the age and mystery of the place.

We also dropped by Chaparai, a natural rock formation that acts like a water slide, I swear, you’ll turn into a kid again seeing it haha.

And somewhere in between all that, we visited the Araku Coffee Plantation. They have this beautiful wooden bridge in the middle of tall coffee trees. We went once early in the morning and again in the evening, both times were equally peaceful, it was pure calm.


From there, we drove to Vanajangi for our night stay. The drive was straight up gorgeous, passing through bright sunflower fields 🌻 (the third picture says it all).

Budget: ₹15K for 2.5 days in Vizag (resort stay), ₹10K for 2 days in Araku.
Duration: 4–5 days total for both.
Train from Vizag to Araku - a must for the tunnels and views.
Perfect for a weekend escape or a short break that mixes beaches, hills, peace, and food.

Vizag & Araku, one gives you the sea, the other gives you the sky. Together, they’re everything that makes Andhra feel like home.

I’m planning to make Tiramisu this week and I was wondering if anyone had any tips on making sure the lady fingers aren’t soggy. I have previously made Tiramisu once and the lady fingers ended up soggy (I recall I did a brief quick dip in the coffee per what the recipe said.) I wasn’t sure if it was cause the coffee was too hot or if the coffee was supposed to be cooled or if I should dunk the lady fingers in quicker(?) I also saw some recipes say to brush the coffee on the ladyfingers instead so I’m not sure which method works best. If anyone knows any tips or tricks please let me know!

anyway, the timing might not be the right one! i've been unemployed for the last 7 months and have not stopped looking but no luck, thank god my grandma let me live with her and is taking care of me to this day! a little over a month ago i was doing some errands when one my friends that i met through a previous job asked me to hang out, we had a couple of drinks and one thing led to another and ended up hooking up!
he is 8 years older than me and we were safe, about 3 weeks ago i took a pregnancy test which was defective because not a single line showed up so i completely forgot about it until 3 days later when i found the test again and there it was a very, very faded second line! i freaked out a little bit asked one of my friends who is a doctor and works especially with pregnant women and babies, she told me to take a blood test to make sure so my best friend accompanied me to get the blood test done, later we went to get a coffee and as soon as we sat down the results arrived and they were positive, i was definitely pregnant!
after 10 minutes of full on crying at the coffee shop, we call our other best friend and told her the news! after that we ended our afternoon and went our separate ways, the next day my mom came to my grandma's(her MIL) and i couldn't hold it and cried my eyes out to her while showing her the blood test result, she went pale and gave me a little lecture but ended up telling that she was excited about it!
so now to the part where i need help, my dad is not the best person to take news well let alone this kind of news! my mom and i have talked about how to tell him but we both are so afraid of what he's reaction might be that we keep postponing it! 
when i tell you that we are scared is not like he's a violent person or that kind of thing, we're scared cause he might stopped talking to me and my mom, he might say really hurtful stuff which is the way he always reacts to everything!
makes very anxious because me finding a job has been impossible to date, me being pregnant means i'll have to move out of my grandma's and move in with my parents which is what my mom suggested but moving in with them depends on my dad's reaction to the news!
so any advice or similar situation any of you have been through or heard? anything is useful at this point!",1,1761968109.0,Girlsadvice,0,0.99,False

Sandra Alan was truly happy. She had to be. The studio was watching.

Sitting in *her* chair with *her* monogram where they were making *her* show, she had caught her dream. She couldn’t let anything distract her. Not the pink cupcake of a dress pinching her skin in all the wrong places. Not the beads of sweat threatening to flood away her fresh makeup. Not even the constant eyes of the crew—always looking at her and darting away before she could look back. They felt like fire on her skin. She told herself they lit her up. She would never allow herself to admit that they threatened to burn her alive.

She fought away unhelpful feelings and tried to study her script. Yes, Papa had called her that morning. She always had to brace herself for those conversations. Yes, today’s call was even more difficult than usual. Mama had never come home from her trip to the grocery store. She had been struck while crossing the intersection of Main and Humphreys. Papa said the driver was later arrested for driving under the influence after running into the Dove Hill’s flag pole. Mama was already dead when he found her. And yes, Sandra was going to have to miss the funeral.

But she had to stay. Mama had always told her to chase her dream. She was doing this for her. She would feel later.

She read the script over and over again–memorizing each line like a sacred text–praying it would distract her from the memory of Mama. Mama who used to sing silly songs to distract her from bad feelings. Mama who wouldn’t sing again.

She reminded herself of the call from the night before. Her show had been picked up. The network had ordered 20 episodes to air in their Saturday morning preschool block. She and her characters had the chance to help raise the next generation. The work started today. Mama would have to wait. She would have wanted to wait.

She started to read the episode, “Put on a Happy Face,” for the fourth…fourteenth…she couldn’t remember how many times before a production assistant shouted, “Five minutes to take one of *Sunnyside Square* episode one.”

On cue, Sandra shouted, “Thank you five!” Her training in Dove Hill’s now dead community theatre had never left her. She had come a long way from her hometown’s mere two stop signs.

Her assistant walked up to her—a bit too excited like always. She needed to learn to not look like she was trying so hard. Sandra knew how hard that was. As she began to tidy Sandra’s blonde beehive wig, the assistant asked “How are you holding up?” a little too kindly. “You know, no one would judge you if you went to be with your father.” She was doing her genuine best to be reassuring, but Sandra could tell that she was nervous. If she left, production would stop, and jobs would be in danger.

“I’m fine really, but that’s very kind. Thank you…” Sandra felt horribly rude for not remembering her assistant’s name. “Thank you.”

Her assistant laughed a little too hard. “You better be! This is what you’ve been working for!”

Her assistant walked away with the nervous energy of someone waiting for a callback, and Sandra could breathe for a moment. Before she could fully exhale, her director called for her. “Sandra Alan to the stage!” It was a demand more than a request. The network had assigned Sandra this director. One of the executives told her agent he was the best children’s TV director in their Rolodex. She didn’t let herself question how he could be with the way he avoided the child actors like frightful pests. She also didn’t let herself question when the director called her hotel room late the night before to “invite” her to his suite. Or when he insisted she have a scotch. Or when he started to loosen his belt. She knew her part.

When she stepped foot on the sound stage, she felt genuine joy. It was everything she had dreamed of. The painted background showing a happy green park. The white wooden bench just like the one in her grandmother’s garden. And the red brick wall standing waist-high to let her friends talk to her. She was going to get to share this world she had built with the children watching the TV. Of course, in her dreams, Joey the puppeteer was not behind the wall trying to steady herself through the after effects of last night’s cocaine binge.

Spreading the short tulle skirt of her Barbie dress and sitting on the bench, Sandra knew everything was perfect. Then she noticed the waist pinching her too tightly. She needed to try that cleanse again. A production assistant handed her the only prop for that scene: a simple chocolate ice cream cone made of hard plastic. She nodded firmly at the director. “Rolling!”

She felt the fires back on her skin. With everyone watching her, Sandra tried to stay in the character of her sweet and innocent alter ego, Sunny Sandy. She remembered how she felt in her childhood: safe and at peace, so long as she played her part. She licked the ice cream cone. It tasted like a medical glove. Right on cue, she pushed the ice cream part of the prop onto the ground with her tongue. In perfect time, she made her face look surprised and then sad. Then she started to cry.

Her old friend Maggie the Magenta Moo Cow walked up from behind the wall. Covering Joey’s shaking hand, Maggie looked like she did when Sandra first imagined her when she was five. She was friendly and familiar like an ordinary dairy cow, but her felt was magenta with white spots.

In a loose imitation of the voice Sandra had used when she presented Maggie to the network, Maggie mooed, “Oh, hi Sandy. What’s wrong? Why are you crying?”

With a dramatic sniffle to dry her artificial tears, Sandy responded, “Oh, Maggie. I’m not feeling very sunny today. I dropped my ice cream.” 

Her puppeteer doing an admirable maternal cow—all things considered—Maggie bleated, “Well, don’t be sad. You know what your Granny Rainbow always says…”

From behind the acrylic park, an old piano started playing a syrupy melody just out of tune. Maggie began to sing:

*“If you’re not feeling happy today,*

*Just put on a happy face.*

*It’ll make the pain go away*

*Before you forget to say…”*

Sandra readied herself for her turn. When she mentioned Granny Rainbow, Maggie had reminded Sandra just for a moment of her family—Grandpa George, Granny Ruth, Mama. As Maggie finished her refrain, Sandra snapped her heart to attention and joined in harmony.

*“If you’re not feeling happy today,*

*Just put on a happy face.*

*It’ll make the pain go away*

*Before you forget to say…”*

The crew visibly relaxed as Maggie and Sandy sang on. The show was going to work. The rest of the puppeteers brought out Sandra’s other creations: an orange owl, a red rabbit, geese, goats, and more. Through the camera lens, the scene was pastel perfection.

But, in the flesh, something was wrong. Sandra’s assistant chose not to see it. Sandra’s teeth were dazzling white, but her smile was stretched too thin. Her eyes gleamed, but it was a gleam of tears threatening to break through. Caroline watched carefully. These weren’t tears of sadness or grief. They were tears of frenzied determination—of someone who was cutting her heart open to make herself feel joy.

The song played on. Playing her part perfectly, Sandy forgot about her ice cream and sang along with her animal friends in all the wrong colors. And, as she sang in her cotton candy frills, *Sunnyside Square* built itself around her.

**2024**

Mikey Dobson woke up precisely at 7:55 like he had every morning he could remember. He had not needed it since he turned 13, but he always set an alarm just in case. Reaching for his phone to turn it off, Mikey remembered the dream he was having when he awoke. A green park in a small town square out of a picture book. Surrounded by an old crimson brick wall that somehow looked as new as if it had been built yesterday. And a polite white bench.

Mikey knew he had never been to this park. He doubted that anyone had been to a park like that since the 1950s. He had only had recurring dreams of it—first when he started his senior year of high school and now again since Bree started his campaign. But it still felt deeply familiar. Like a park that he might have visited when he was a young boy.

This time, though, something was subtly different. More the impression of the dream than the experience. The trees in the park were still tall, but they were ominous—not lofty. The brick wall was still solid, but it was impenetrable—not sturdy. And remembering the dream now, Mikey thought it ended differently this time. He couldn’t remember how, but there was something new. A presence that woke him up with a sense of overwhelm instead of peace.

When he picked up his phone, Mikey saw he had already missed several texts from Bree. One a perfunctory good morning, “Hey, little brother! Big day today! Proud of you!” Then a handful laying out his schedule for the day. Work at the office from 9 to 5. Then at the campaign headquarters from 5 to 9. He knew that his days would grow longer as the election approached. For now, working the schedule of a normal lawyer seemed easy.

He put his feet down on his apartment’s cold wooden floor and walked to the television hanging opposite his bed. He turned it on just as the theme song for the local morning news started.

Somehow, Dotty Doyle was still hosting. She may not have looked like a general store brand Katie Couric anymore, but she was still holding on. Even if her permed blonde hair seemed to be permanently strangling her gray roots.

“Good morning, Dove Hill!,” she rasped in an effortful echo of her younger voice. “It’s another sunny day! Even if the clouds disagree.” Mikey let some air out of his nose. Dotty’s jokes had not gotten better with age. “Today’s top story: the race for Dove Hill’s seat in the state legislature. Young hometown attorney Mikey Dobson is running to unseat 12-term incumbent Edmund Pruce whose office was recently the subject of an ethics investigation that has since been closed at the governor’s order.”

Bree’s publicist had done a good job. Mikey barely recognized himself in the photograph. In the mirror, he saw a too tired and too skinny nerd whose hair was too black to be brown and too brown to be black. On the TV, he looked like John F. Kennedy with an Adam Driver filter. The glasses he was always anxious about keeping clean actually made him look smart. Especially next to his wrinkly plum of an opponent. Mikey didn’t hate Pruce, but he was certainly made for the world before Instagram.

“The latest polling shows Pruce with a substantial lead thanks largely to the district’s heavy partisan tilt. Dobson’s campaign, led admirably by Dobson’s sister Bree, is under-resourced but earnest. And Dobson’s themes of bipartisanship, town-and-gown partnership, and clean government along with the campaign’s mastery of social media seem to be appealing to younger voters.” Mikey couldn’t disagree with the narrative there. With only a fraction of their parents’ promised funds having come through, Bree had done a lot with a little.

Still listening to Dotty’s monologue about the job losses threatened by federal cuts to Dove Hill College’s budget, Mikey showered and shaved. He put on his Monday coat and tie while Harry Carey—the frumpled weatherman with a pun for a God-given name—tried to make a week of clouds sound pleasant. When Mikey grabbed the remote to turn off the TV, Dotty Doyle teased, “Remember to join us this Friday night for the first and only debate between Edmund Pruce and Mikey Dobson. The world–or at least our studio–will be watching.” At exactly 8:50 am, Mikey grabbed his coffee and opened the door.

Walking out to find his door being watched impatiently by Rosa the cleaner, Mikey paused for just a moment. He reminded himself that he was happy. He had graduated from an Ivy League school. He had opened his own law office. He was running for office. And his parents, according to their Facebook posts, were proud of him.

Using the mindfulness techniques that his therapists had taught him, Mikey brought himself back to the present. He turned to Rosa and gave her a pleasant smile. “Buenos días, Rosa!,” he recited in perfect Spanish. “Gracias por limpiar mi lugar y todos tu arduo trabajo.” Every person was a potential voter.

Looking into the mop water on Rosa’s cart, Mikey found himself thrust back into memory of that morning’s dream. He remembered that he had been stirred by the strange feeling of drowning in something other than water. Something thin and gauzy. Then he remembered the sight that he saw right before opening his eyes. The material he was drowning in was bright, almost neon pink—somewhere between Pepto-Bismol and that hard bubblegum he used to get at church. He knew the park dream happened when he was stressed, but this hot pink funeral shroud was something new.

Mikey caught himself. It was time to work.

\*	\*	\*

Mikey looked out his office window onto Main Street. At the corner of Main and Humphreys, he spent his days in the center of Dove Hill’s downtown—or what the town had of one. He had been lucky to find this place when he hung out his shingle. The realtor, an old acquaintance from Colvin Preparatory School, had tried to tell him that something sad had happened at the intersection back in the 90s, but Mikey ignored him. The rent was cheap, and that’s what mattered.

That morning and afternoon, he had worked on pleasantly mundane tasks: drafting a complaint, reviewing a deposition transcript, checking the mail. Mikey even found something to like about billing hours. He was fortunate. Unlike most of his law school classmates, he actually liked being a lawyer.

Or he had at one point. As he had brought in more and more work, his family had started to help him. His mother emailed him to make sure he was keeping at a healthy weight. His father had Bree check in to make sure he was making enough money. When Bree started to plan the campaign, she started to advise Mikey on which clients and cases he should take. Of course, none of his family’s suggestions were optional.

With 4:00 pm approaching, Mikey prepared for a meeting with a potential client. Since he was one of the very few attorneys in town—perhaps the only one without a drinking problem—Mikey never knew what kind of client or case these meetings were going to bring. At precisely 4:00 pm, Mikey opened the door to see a round man with a look like he was meeting an old friend.

Mikey welcomed him in and listened to his story. The man explained that he had just been released from the Mason County Correctional Facility. Apparently, this was going to be a civil rights case. The man described the conditions in the prison. Mikey wished he could be surprised at the routine violations of basic laws and human rights. He couldn’t be. He had grown up hearing the same stories from some of his extended family—third cousins and the like. This was the kind of case Mikey had become a lawyer to take. But he knew he couldn’t take this one. He couldn’t look anti-cop with the election just months away.

“So that’s my story,” the man concluded.

“I understand,” Mikey lied kindly. “Thank you for sharing with me.” He meant that part.

“Do you think you can help me, Attorney Dobson?”

“I’m not sure. Let me step out and call my associate.”

Mikey left the cramped conference room that used to be a kitchen. Pulling up his recents to call Bree, he realized he had been using a creative definition of “associate” over the past few months.

Bree answered efficiently. “Hey! Are you on the way?”

“Not quite. I’m wrapping up a meeting with a potential client.”

“Is this another soft-on-crime case?”

“It’s not soft on crime. It’s…,” Mikey began to protest.

“No. Absolutely not.” The law had spoken. “You know we can’t take those cases this close to the election. You’re running to make the change that will keep those cases from happening in the first place. You can’t let your feelings make you sacrifice your future.” Mikey wondered why Bree said that “we” couldn’t take the case.

“Yeah. You’re right. I’ll see you soon.”

As Mikey opened the door to tell the man the news, the man’s phone rang. Mikey knew he remembered that song. Jaunty. Sweet. But he couldn’t place it. *If you’re not feeling happy today…* Remembering those lyrics, Mikey felt seen. And watched.

“So, what’s the verdict?,” the man hoped out loud.

“I’m sorry, sir. The firm just can’t take on a case like yours at the moment. If you’d like, I can refer you to some other attorneys.”

“No thanks. I’ll take this as my answer.”

Mikey flinched at that then continued the script.

“Well, thank you for coming in. It’s always a pleasure to meet someone from our town.”

Waiting for Mikey to open the door, the man mumbled genuinely, “Sure. Thanks for your time. I’m still going to vote for you.”

He went to close the door behind the man but couldn’t stop himself from asking. “Excuse me. Sir?” The man turned around halfway down the brick walkway. “I love your ringtone. What song is that? I know I heard it when I was a kid, but I can’t remember the name.”

The man looked at Mikey like he had just asked if his prison had been on Jupiter. “I think it’s called Marimba or something. It’s just the default.”

Mikey gave the man a kind nod. Closing the door behind him, he tried to shake off the feeling that came over him when he heard that song. It had made him feel uncomfortably aware of the man’s eyes on him when he braced to deliver the bad news. It was like the man was suddenly joined by an invisible audience that waited for Mikey to say the lines he had rehearsed so many times. The song reminded Mikey of something always waiting just out of sight—waiting to swallow him whole if he ever failed to act his part. Or, the song would have reminded him of the void. Fortunately, the song was just the default smartphone ringtone.

Mikey walked back to his desk, shut his laptop, and grabbed his blazer on the way out the door. In the past, he might have stayed late to work on cases. Not this year.

Driving down Chelsea Street, he passed the old bookstore where he had spent hours on afternoons when his parents were working and Bree was building her resume with one extracurricular or another. The owner, Mrs. Brown, had always made him feel at home. He wasn’t sure if it was because of her failing memory or because she saw just what he needed, but Mrs. Brown had always left Mikey alone. He had cherished that time alone with Mrs. Brown where he could breathe without someone’s eyes waiting for him to do something wrong. Something that the kids at school would make fun of and his family would try to fix. In Mrs. Brown’s store, Mikey could just *be*.

By the time memory had taken him to his junior year when Mrs. Brown’s store was run out of the market by internet sales, Mikey had arrived at his campaign office. That was probably not the right word. It was more the building that his campaign office was in. The building that had been the town civic center some decades ago. Now it had been converted into a rarely-used venue for weddings and receptions and overflow offices for some of the mayor’s staff. One of these town employees was a daughter of one of Bree’s favorite professors, and he had convinced her to let Bree borrow it after city work hours.

Walking from his car to the double dark-panel wooden doors, Mikey appreciated that the mayor who had ordered the renovation had at least thought to preserve the building’s frame. It had been there longer than anyone still alive in the aging town.

Bree was waiting just inside the dust-odored lobby when Mikey opened the doors. Before either of them said anything, Bree gave Mikey a flash of a smile. They always had this moment. Before they started talking about the campaign or their careers or what they could do better, Bree looked at Mikey like a proud big sister happy to see her little brother. Mikey remembered this smile from their childhoods, but it had become fainter and rarer as Bree aged and took on more responsibilities. Ever since their father informed them that Bree would be running Mikey’s campaign, the smile had only come in these flashes.

“Hey. Good day at work?” Bree asked perfunctorily. Mikey loved her for trying.

“Normal,” Mikey said, following Bree down the side hallway to the cramped office. “So I can’t complain.”

“I’m glad,” Bree answered. Mikey wasn’t sure if she was glad he said he had had a good day or glad he was not complaining. Probably both.

The two sat down in the professor’s daughter’s town-issued pleather chairs, and Bree commenced.

“Thank you for coming this evening.” She ran these meetings like she was reading a profit and loss statement in a Fortune 500 conference room. Mikey often wondered if she would rather have been. “The polling is still not optimal. We’re trailing 45 to 50 with 8 percent undecided. The latest social campaign went well. The A-B testing found that the voters prefer you in a red tie so we’ll stick with that going forward.”

Tired of fighting it, Bree pushed her a runaway wisp of black hair out of her face with a red headband. Mikey smiled to himself as he realized that she had done that ever since they were kids. She was always too serious to bother with her hair.

“Anti-corruption is still your strongest issue. People seem to like that coming from someone young and idealistic. The question is whether it will be enough to get people to the polls when Pruce has the culture war on his side.”

Mikey nodded at the right time. He wanted to pay attention. Bree had worked hard to prepare this report. It was hard when he knew his opinions didn’t matter. Bree made the decisions for the campaign, and the polls made the decisions for Bree. He hated himself for being so cynical, but he was a politician now. He was just the smiling face on the well-oiled machine.

While Bree started to explain Mikey’s campaign schedule up through Friday’s debate, Mikey thought he heard something familiar. It sounded like a woman humming in the room next door. Except, in the office at the end of the narrow hallway, there was no room next door. Mikey decided he wasn’t hearing anything.

Bree dictated, “Tomorrow, we have a meeting with Ryan Scarnes, your publicist.”

*If you’re not feeling happy today…*

The wordless music continued, now coming from both the room that wasn’t next door and behind the professor’s daughter’s desk.

Mikey’s decision failed him. He was definitely hearing something. He told himself maybe it was an old toy in one of the cardboard boxes that towered in the corner opposite him. He looked up at Bree to see if she heard anything. She reported on without a moment’s hesitation.

“Then on Wednesday we have the meet and greet at the nature center.”

Moving his head as little as possible, Mikey began to dart his eyes around the room. The music was coming from above now. Mikey thought there might have been an attic there before the renovation.

*Just put on a smiling face…*

He tried his best to look focused. He always tried his best.

“On Thursday, we have your appearance for seniors at the YMCA.”

He was fighting to keep breathing, but the air was leaving him. The music, now all around him and getting louder, was almost suffocating. He felt like he was drowning in it.

*It’ll make the pain go away…*

His nerves began to demand his body move. First his fingers began to tap the chair’s worn arm. The music grew louder. Then his feet joined in. The music was nearly deafening.

At that, Bree looked up from her papers. For another fleeting moment, she looked at him like a sibling instead of a campaign manager. But this time it was a look of concern instead of affection.

“You good?” Bree’s question was almost drowned out by the song.

“Yeah, yeah. I’m fine. Probably just too much coffee.” Mikey felt like he was shouting, but he knew he was using his inside voice.

Almost as scared of Bree’s disappointment as the music from the void, Mikey ventured, “Do you hear something?”

The music stopped except for the faint hum from the woman in the room that wasn’t next door.

*Before you forget to say…*

“No.” Bree’s face looked just as Mikey had feared. Worried but not willing to show it.

Silence kindly returned.

With an earnest attempt at earnestness, Mikey pivoted. “And the debate’s Friday?”

“Right…” Bree said as if she were asking herself for permission to continue. “But I’ll do the walkthrough of the venue on Thursday.”

While Bree haltingly continued to the financial section of her report, Mikey remembered. The song was called “Put on a Smiling Face,” and it was from *Sunnyside Square*.",1,1761967739.0,u_JLKeay,0,1.0,False

Growing up as a twin sounds fun, right? Built-in best friend, someone who always has your back, someone who gets you without explanation. That’s what I had—at least for the first ten years of my life.

My twin brother, Jackson, was the center of my world. We were fraternal twins, but opposites in every way. Jackson was tall, lean, athletic, and could make friends with just about anyone. I was short, a little chunky, shy to the point of painful, and usually tripping over my own feet.

But it never mattered to me. I didn’t need a million friends. I had Jackson. He was my best friend, my other half, my person.

It was always just the two of us. Our mom worked constantly to keep food on the table, so most of the time it was just me and him. Maybe that’s why we clung to each other so hard.

“Jax, I wanna go home,” I whined, dragging my feet as he tossed a football from hand to hand.

“Jess, chill. I told the new kid I’d meet him here to throw the ball around,” he said, his brown eyes locked on the field like he was already in the NFL.

“This is boring.” I plopped down on the grass.

He sighed, dug in his pocket, and tossed me a granola bar. “Here. Peanut butter. Your favorite.”

Instant mood boost. “Yes! Thanks, Jax.”

While I was tearing open the wrapper, he straightened up, glancing at the entrance to the field. “That’s him.”

A boy about our age walked toward us, a football tucked under his arm. He had dark, messy brown hair and the greenest eyes I’d ever seen. The kind of eyes you notice right away. And his lashes? Long enough to make me jealous.

“Hey,” he said to Jackson.

“Hey, Noah. This is my twin, Jessa.”

I scrambled up, brushing grass off my jeans. My mouth moved faster than my brain. “Wow… you’ve got really long eyelashes. For a boy.”

Noah’s cheeks turned pink. “Uh, thanks?”

Jackson groaned. “Sorry, she doesn’t have a filter sometimes.”

“I just meant they’re… pretty,” I tried, wishing I could disappear.

“Jess, why don’t you go sit while we toss the ball around,” Jackson muttered.

“She doesn’t play?” Noah asked.

I shook my head before Jackson could answer. “Not really my thing.”

“Nope. If she tried to throw, she’d probably knock herself over,” Jackson joked.

I pretended not to care, sitting back down on the sidelines, but my eyes kept drifting toward Noah as he and Jackson tossed the ball. He wasn’t just cute—he was quiet, too. Almost shy. Something about him made me want him to like me.

After they finished, Jackson clapped him on the back. “You’ve got a good arm.”

“Two older brothers taught me some stuff,” Noah shrugged.

“Oh! So they’re your best friends too, like me and Jackson?” I asked eagerly.

“No. They’re just… brothers. I don’t really have a best friend.”

My heart squeezed. “Then you should get one. Me and Jackson do everything together. He’s the best best friend you could ever have.”

Noah looked at Jackson. Jackson just shrugged. Noah nodded slightly, like he got the message.

At the time, I didn’t realize how wrong I was.

One Month Later

“I don’t wanna go to the movies, Jax!” I whined, arms crossed.

“Too bad. Noah and I wanna see the new Marvel movie. You can’t stay home alone.”

“We always do what you and Noah want. What about me?”

He sighed. “Jess, I love you. But sometimes I wanna do stuff without you. You need to find your own friends.”

That stung more than I wanted to admit.

The doorbell rang, and Noah walked in with his usual smirk.

“Sup.”

“Jess, get your shoes on,” Jackson ordered.

“She’s coming too?” Noah asked.

“Yeah. Mom’s at work. I’m babysitting.”

“Babysitting?” I snapped. “We’re the same age! You’re not babysitting me.”

“I’m twelve minutes older,” Jackson shot back.

Noah snickered. “She’s definitely acting like the baby.”

I stormed off to grab my shoes, but I froze halfway up the stairs when I heard Noah’s voice:

“Man, your sister’s such a brat. Wish she didn’t have to tag along.”

Jackson’s answer was the knife that cut deepest. “Tell me about it.”

At the theater, I tried to forget. “Jax, can we get popcorn? With extra butter?”

Noah raised his brows. “Do you really need the extra butter?”

I clenched my fists. “Yes. I like it that way.”

Jackson slipped me a couple of bills. “Get your own small one.”

I headed for the snack line, and that’s when I heard them again.

“She always has to be eating,” Noah muttered.

“Yeah,” Jackson said with a low laugh. “Sometimes it’s embarrassing to be seen with her.”

The words hit harder than any punch. My own twin—my best friend—was embarrassed of me.

“Hey, it’s your turn,” a girl behind me said gently.

I shook my head. “Changed my mind.”

She frowned. “You okay?”

“No,” I whispered. “I think I lost my best friend.”

She studied me, then said, “I’m Mariah. We’re in the same class, right? You’re Jessa. Jackson’s twin.”

“Yeah.”

“What movie are you supposed to be seeing?”

“Some superhero thing.”

Mariah smirked. “Ditch it. Come with me instead. There’s a new comedy. Way cuter lead actor.”

Before I could decide, Jackson and Noah appeared.

“Jess, what’s taking so long?” Jackson demanded. “Oh, hey, Mariah.”

Mariah smiled sweetly. “Hi. Jessa and I are seeing the comedy instead.”

Jackson shrugged. “Fine. Meet us in the lobby after.”

As he and Noah disappeared, Mariah tugged me toward her theater.

“Come on. You need a laugh.”

I glanced back one last time at my brother’s retreating figure.

He stole my best friend, I thought. And he’s never giving him back.

Three Years Later

Thirteen hit me hard. My body changed in ways I didn’t ask for. I wasn’t the chubby little girl anymore—I had curves. Breasts too big for my age. Hips that didn’t match the other girls at school.

Mom always said, Girls built like us need to cover up. Layers make you look thinner.

So I wore baggy shirts. Oversized hoodies. Clothes that swallowed me whole. It didn’t matter. The teasing still came.

“Jess, you’re wearing that?” Jackson asked one morning, eyeing my loose shirt.

“It’s comfortable.”

“It’s a tent.” He rolled his eyes and left.

Mom kissed my cheek. “Ignore him. He doesn’t understand what it’s like for girls like us.”

At school, the comments started before I even reached the doors.

“The circus is in town!”

“Yeah, they brought the whale exhibit!”

My stomach dropped when I saw where it came from—Jackson and Noah, flanked by their football buddies, all laughing.

“Nice shirt, Jess,” Noah snorted. “They only had tent size left?”

“Shut up, Noah.”

Jackson smirked. “Told you it was too big.”

“Perfect for hiding that fat ass,” Noah added, sending the group into hysterics.

I turned away, pretending I couldn’t hear. But their laughter followed me.

By the time I reached my locker, my hands were shaking. I tugged the handle, but it was jammed. Mariah appeared at my side.

“Need help?”

We pulled together until it finally burst open—and trash bags tumbled out, spilling all over the hallway.

A note taped to one read: Got you a new wardrobe.

The roar of laughter around us was deafening.

“Did you do this?” Mariah snapped at Jackson and Noah, who had pushed through the crowd to watch.

Noah grinned. “She wants to dress like a hobo? Why not just give her options?”

Jackson chuckled. “Relax. It’s just a joke.”

Mariah glared at him. “She’s your sister.”

But Jackson only walked away with Noah.

I stared at the trash bag in my hands. For just one second, I wished I could trade places. To be the one laughing, not the one humiliated.

Present Day

Beep. Beep. Beep.

I groaned, slamming my alarm clock. Senior year. My last year in this hellhole.

I’m Jessa. Nobody special. Just the overweight twin sister of Jackson, starting quarterback and golden boy of our high school. The sister his best friend, Noah Carter, has made it his life’s mission to torment.

Once, when I was ten, I thought Noah was cute. That crush didn’t survive the year. Now at eighteen, he’s tall, broad-shouldered, perfect hair, perfect smile. Every girl wants him.

And I can’t stand him.

But he’s always around—because he’s Jackson’s best friend. The boy who stole my brother from me.

I roll out of bed and tug on my armor: jeans, tank top, oversized button-up. The layers hide the body I’ve been told to be ashamed of.

Time to sneak out before Jackson sees me. Before Noah’s voice finds me.

Another day. Another battle.

# Chapter 2

Jessa

I tiptoe down the hallway, holding my breath. If Jackson’s awake, he’ll have some comment locked and loaded about my clothes, my hair, or just… me. I’d rather start the day without it.

Too late. His bedroom door creaks open, and there he is—my twin, my other half, my betrayer—all six feet of cocky quarterback standing in my way.

“Morning, Jess,” he says, eyes flicking over my shirt. “Nice… tent.”

I don’t even answer. I just shoulder past him, my cheeks heating.

“Aw, come on, don’t be so sensitive,” he calls after me.

Sensitive. That’s what he calls me when his words cut deep, like it’s my fault for feeling anything.

By the time I make it to the kitchen, Mom’s already gone. She leaves early most mornings, and I can’t decide if I’m grateful or jealous. Grateful that she doesn’t see me like this, jealous that she never has time for us.

Jackson grabs a protein shake from the fridge and downs it like he’s in some athlete commercial. I butter a piece of toast, trying to look invisible.

And then, of course, the devil himself arrives.

Noah Carter.

He strolls right into our kitchen like he owns it, helmet tucked under his arm, hair still damp from his shower, all six-foot-two of golden-boy arrogance. He’s wearing his jersey, number 14, stretched across broad shoulders like it was custom made for him.

And because I’m apparently a glutton for punishment, my stupid brain notices the curve of his jaw, the way his damp hair curls at the edges, the clean soap-and-sweat smell that clings to him. I hate myself for noticing.

“Morning, sunshine,” he smirks at me.

I roll my eyes. “Don’t call me that.”

“What? Thought you’d like a nickname.” His grin widens, like he knows exactly how to get under my skin.

Jackson laughs and bumps fists with him. “Ignore her, bro. Ready for practice?”

“Always,” Noah says. He glances at my toast, eyebrows lifting. “Extra butter again?”

I slam the knife down. “Seriously? Do you ever get tired of commenting on what I eat?”

Jackson snorts. “Don’t mind him, Jess.”

But I mind. God, I mind so much.

The two of them head out to the truck, leaving me with a cold piece of toast and the familiar ache in my chest. It’s the same ache I’ve had since I was ten years old.

The ache of realizing my twin—my best friend—chose someone else.

At school, it doesn’t get better. It never does.

The minute I step into the hallway, eyes flick my way. Whispers. Snickers. The same crap I’ve been hearing since middle school.

“Damn, she’s bigger than the linebackers.”

“Bet she eats more than the team.”

I keep walking, head down, pretending the words don’t stab me. But they do. Every single one leaves another scar I can’t cover with oversized clothes.

Jackson doesn’t notice, or maybe he does and just doesn’t care. He’s too busy soaking in the glory of being the starting quarterback. Too busy laughing with Noah and the rest of the team.

Noah. Always Noah.

The worst part is that when he laughs, it’s this deep, warm sound that makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up. When he smiles, girls melt into puddles. And when his hazel eyes catch the light, they almost glow.

I hate that I’ve noticed all of that.

I hate that part of me gets why the entire female population of Crestwood High would kill for a chance with him.

I hate that part of me, some twisted little part buried deep down, remembers what it felt like to have a crush on him before he turned into my tormentor.

Mariah finds me by my locker. Thank God for her. She’s the one good thing that came out of all this—the girl who saw me breaking at the movies three years ago and decided not to let me stand alone.

“You look like you’re ready to murder someone,” she says, tucking a strand of her blonde hair behind her ear.

“Noah,” I mutter. “As usual.”

She makes a face. “Ugh. You’d think after all these years he’d get bored.”

“He doesn’t. It’s like tormenting me is his favorite sport, right after football.”

Mariah sighs. “Well, senior year, right? Almost done.”

Almost. But almost feels like forever.

Lunch is the worst. Always has been.

I sit with Mariah at the edge of the cafeteria, away from the football table. But no matter how far away I am, Noah still finds me with his eyes. I feel them, sharp as daggers, hot as a spotlight.

Today’s no different. I’m halfway through my sandwich when I hear him across the room.

“Hey, Jackson! Better hide your food or Jess will eat it all before you blink.”

Laughter erupts from the table. Jackson doesn’t defend me. He never does.

I keep my head down, cheeks burning, praying no one else joins in. But of course they do.

“She could be the team mascot,” someone says. “Put her in pads, she’ll bulldoze the defense!”

The guys howl with laughter.

Mariah leans across the table, her eyes flashing. “Ignore them. They’re idiots.”

But ignoring doesn’t make it stop.

I grip my sandwich so tightly my knuckles turn white. In my head, I imagine standing up, marching over there, and telling Noah exactly what he is—a bully. A coward. A pathetic jerk who gets off on tearing me down.

But I don’t move.

Because I know what would happen if I did. He’d smirk. He’d say something sharper. And Jackson would laugh right alongside him.

Just like always.

That night, lying in bed, I stare at the ceiling.

This is my last year. One more year of Noah Carter. One more year of Jackson pretending I don’t exist except when it’s convenient. One more year of being “the fat twin,” the joke, the nobody.

After graduation, I’ll be free. College will be my reset button. Nobody will know me as Jackson’s sister or Noah’s favorite target. Nobody will remember the locker full of trash bags or the jokes about butter.

It’ll just be me.

But even as I tell myself that, my brain betrays me. Because it’s not Noah’s insults that replay behind my eyes. It’s his face. His stupidly perfect, sharp-jawed, broad-shouldered, movie-star face.

And I hate myself for it.

The next morning, the cycle repeats. Jackson teasing, Mom absent, me shrinking into myself.

But when Noah shows up, there’s a shift. Not big, not obvious—just a flicker.

He catches me staring.

I don’t mean to. Honest. I’m just zoning out, and my gaze lands on him, on the way his T-shirt stretches across his chest, on the strong line of his throat as he tilts his head back to laugh at something Jackson says.

And then his hazel eyes lock on mine.

For a second, I can’t breathe.

There’s no smirk, no insult, no sharp edge. Just Noah looking at me like… like he sees me.

Then he blinks, and it’s gone. Replaced by the same cocky grin I know too well.

“Like what you see, Sunshine?”

My face burns. “In your dreams.”

But that flicker stays with me all day.

And it terrifies me more than all his insults combined. Because what if—just what if—the boy who’s made my life hell for years is the one I can’t stop noticing?

What if the one I hate most is the one I’m secretly drawn to? And what if he knows it?

# Chapter 3

Noah

Most people think I’ve got it easy.

They see the jersey, the captain’s armband, the girls who slide notes into my locker, the teachers who cut me slack because I’m “leading the team this season.” They see the highlight reels, the touchdowns, the swagger.

And yeah, I play into it. Why wouldn’t I? That image has kept me on top since freshman year.

But what they don’t see—the part I’d never admit out loud—is that the best part of my day isn’t the touchdowns. It’s not the cheers, or even the wins.

It’s Jessa Lombardi’s face when I get under her skin.

I shouldn’t find it that entertaining. She’s Jackson’s twin, for one. Which means technically, she’s off-limits. But God, she makes it too easy. The way her cheeks flush, the way she slams things down or throws out these sharp little comebacks—Jessa’s like one giant exposed nerve. Sensitive as hell.

And I like testing how far I can push before she snaps.

Take this morning, for example.

Jackson and I were heading to practice, but I swung by his place first. Walking into their kitchen always feels… weird. I don’t know why. Maybe because I can practically feel how much Jessa doesn’t want me there.

She was standing at the counter, spreading butter on toast like it had personally offended her. Oversized T-shirt, messy hair, bare feet curling against the tile. For a second, I almost didn’t say anything.

Almost.

“Morning, sunshine,” I tossed out, leaning in the doorway.

The way her shoulders stiffened—it was instant gratification. Like watching a fire catch.

“Don’t call me that,” she muttered, eyes on her plate.

“What? Thought you’d like a nickname.”

She rolled her eyes so hard I swear I heard them click.

Jackson laughed, completely oblivious. “Ignore her, bro.”

I didn’t ignore her, of course. Couldn’t. I never do. Instead, I spotted the toast and couldn’t resist. “Extra butter again?”

She slammed the knife down like she wanted to stab me with it.

“Seriously? Do you ever get tired of commenting on what I eat?”

And just like that, my day was made. That flare of anger in her eyes, the way her voice cracked on ever. She didn’t realize it, but she was giving me exactly what I wanted.

Attention.

Here’s the thing: Jessa doesn’t understand me. She thinks I pick on her just to be a jerk, or because I’ve got nothing better to do. But the truth? It’s not that simple.

I notice her.

More than I should.

And noticing her—really noticing her—is dangerous.

Because Jessa’s not like the other girls who throw themselves at me. She doesn’t giggle when I walk by or bat her lashes hoping I’ll toss her a grin. She doesn’t want anything from me.

Except maybe for me to disappear.

And that makes me want to poke, prod, irritate. It makes me want her to look at me, even if it’s with fire in her eyes. Because when she’s angry at me, at least she’s seeing me.

At school, it’s even better.

In the cafeteria, Jackson and I had the whole team cracking up over stupid inside jokes when I spotted her sitting with Mariah. Always the far table, always head down, like she’s hoping to disappear.

But I don’t let her disappear.

“Hey, Jackson!” I yelled across the room. “Better hide your food or Jess will eat it all before you blink.”

The table erupted. Perfect.

I caught the way her shoulders hunched, the way her hand froze halfway to her mouth. She didn’t look up, but I knew she heard me. Knew she felt the sting.

And yeah, maybe that makes me an asshole. But there’s something about her silence that gets to me. Like she’s holding all this emotion inside, and I’m the only one who knows how to drag it out of her.

Jackson doesn’t get it. To him, Jessa’s just… Jessa. His twin, his shadow, the sister he doesn’t think twice about. He doesn’t notice the way she winces when people whisper, or the way she pulls her hoodie tighter like armor.

But I do.

I see it.

And sometimes I wonder if that’s why I keep poking—because if I don’t, maybe no one would notice her at all.

Practice that afternoon should’ve wiped Jessa from my brain. It usually does. Once I’m on the field, nothing else matters. The snap of the ball, the crunch of pads, the roar of the guys—it drowns everything out.

But not today.

Today, when I closed my eyes, all I saw was the way she glared at me over her toast, cheeks flushed, eyes flashing.

And then—God help me—the way her gaze flickered over me. She thought she was subtle, but I caught it. The way her eyes lingered on my shoulders, my chest.

She thinks I don’t notice, but I do.

And that thought sticks with me longer than I’d like.

That night, lying in bed, I try to tell myself it’s nothing. Jessa’s sensitive, that’s all. She reacts to me because I push her buttons. If she didn’t, I’d probably lose interest.

Except… I’m not losing interest.

If anything, I’m hooked.

I want to know how far I can push before she finally snaps. Before she lets me see the fire I know she’s hiding.

I want to know if that fire burns as hot when it’s not anger.

The next morning, I catch her staring again.

She doesn’t realize it—I’m laughing at something Jackson said, tilting my head back, and when I glance over, her eyes are on me. Not in hate. Not in anger. Just… watching.

And for one insane second, it feels like she sees me. Not the quarterback. Not Jackson’s best friend. Not the jerk who won’t leave her alone.

Just me.

Our eyes lock, and the air shifts. She looks caught, like a deer in headlights.

For once, I don’t smirk. For once, I just look back.

But then panic kicks in, and I cover it with a grin. “Like what you see, Sunshine?”

Her face flames. “In your dreams.”

But I heard the hitch in her breath. I saw the way she couldn’t look away fast enough.

And that’s when I know I’m in trouble.

Because tormenting Jessa Lombardi isn’t just a game anymore.

It’s an addiction.

And sooner or later, it’s going to blow up in my face.

# Chapter 4

Noah

The problem with lying to yourself is that eventually, the truth claws its way out.

I’ve been telling myself for years that I bug Jessa because it’s easy. Because she’s reactive, and I like the way she gets flustered. That’s it. Simple.

But it’s not.

If I’m honest—and I almost never am, even in my own head—it started way before she became “sensitive Jessa.”

It started in middle school.

Back then, Jessa was different. Not unrecognizable—she still had the dark eyes, the messy hair, the sharp tongue—but she laughed more. She’d shoot water through her teeth at Jackson during lunch, or race us to the corner store after practice and somehow always win, even though her legs were half the size of ours.

She wasn’t invisible back then. She didn’t try to be.

I noticed her before I even realized I was noticing her. The way her grin curved higher on the right side. The way she’d wrinkle her nose when she concentrated. The way she never backed down, even when she should have.

I liked it.

Too much.

And that scared the hell out of me.

Because she was Jackson’s twin. And Jackson’s my guy—my quarterback, my brother from another mother. There’s an unspoken rule: sisters are off-limits. Period.

So instead of admitting I was drawn to her, I started pushing her away. Teasing, needling, whatever you want to call it. It was easier to play the jerk than to let anyone—including her—guess how I actually felt.

And over the years, that mask stuck.

Now everyone, including Jessa, believes I really am that guy. The one who points out her extra butter, or makes cracks in the cafeteria.

But underneath it? Every time I say something, every time I watch her react, there’s this other layer.

I’m watching her mouth.

I’m watching her eyes.

I’m thinking things I shouldn’t think.

Last week was the worst.

We were at Jackson’s, sprawled on the couch, watching film. Jessa came in with a bowl of popcorn, pretending she didn’t care if we ate it all. She sat on the floor, leaning against the coffee table, hoodie sleeves covering her hands.

And when she laughed—actually laughed at some dumb commentary on TV—it hit me like a helmet to the ribs.

I hadn’t heard that laugh in a long time.

It wasn’t sharp or defensive. It wasn’t trying to hide. It was just… real.

I couldn’t stop staring.

And then she glanced up, caught me looking, and everything inside me knotted tight. Because for a second, I swear she knew.

Knew that I’d been watching her.

Knew that maybe, underneath all the teasing, I wanted her.

The worst part?

I don’t want to stop.

I tell myself I should. That she deserves better than being some secret I bury under sarcasm. That Jackson would kill me if he knew.

But then she glares at me across the table, or snaps back with some fiery retort, and it’s like gasoline on a match. I can’t quit.

It’s like the closer I get to the edge, the more I want to see what happens if I jump.

What happens if I stop hiding behind jokes and just say it.

That I like the way she looks in oversized T-shirts. That I notice how she tucks her hair behind her ear when she’s nervous. That I’ve thought about what her mouth would feel like against mine more times than I can admit.

That the reason I agitate her isn’t because she’s sensitive.

It’s because she makes me feel exposed.

And the only way I know how to handle it is to make her feel the same.

Lying here now, staring at the ceiling in the dark, I know I’m screwed.

Because sooner or later, I won’t be able to keep pretending.

And when that happens, everything—my friendship with Jackson, the team, the fragile balance we’ve all built—could go up in flames.

But the truth?

If it means Jessa finally sees me the way I see her…

""Dottie, right now every headline is about Dashy. Reporters have swarmed the hotel entrance. Please help handle this.""

At 10 PM.

Sitting at her desk, Dorothy Havelock was on the phone with her mother-in-law, Stacey Klein. Hearing her plea, Dorothy pressed a weary hand to her forehead, at a loss for words.

For the past three years since they got married, her husband Dashiell Rafferty's scandals and rumored romances had come in endless waves.

The few times they met were always when she was forced to clean up the mess he left behind.

Noticing her silence, Stacey urged earnestly,""Dottie, this time it's not just the company's reputation and stock price. Natalie's back, and she's different from the others. You must hold onto your marriage with Dashy.""

Dorothy's heart skipped a beat as she thought,""Natalie McClure is back?""

Her brows knit together, exhaustion clouding her face.

After another moment of silence, she finally replied gently,""Stacey, I understand. I'll head over now.""

When the call ended, Dorothy stared at her phone for a long while before finally grabbing her keys and forcing herself to her feet.

...

Half an hour later.

When Dorothy entered through the hotel's back entrance, Mathew Robertson and Shirley McConnell were already waiting at the door.

Shirley, Dorothy's secretary, stepped forward, holding out a luxury shopping bag.""Ms. Havelock, the clothes are ready.""

Tonight, Dorothy would wear the same dress as Natalie. It was part of the cover-up with Dashiell.

Mathew knocked on the door.""Mr. Rafferty, Mrs. Rafferty is here.""

""Come in.""

Dashiell's voice was cool, indifferent, as if the entire situation were routine.

Mathew opened the door for Dorothy. Dashiell had just emerged from the bathroom in loose gray pajamas, his chest and abdomen muscles sharply defined. He casually towel-dried his damp hair, exuding a natural, lazy sensuality.

At the sight of Dorothy, he didn't look the slightest bit guilty or embarrassed at being caught.

After three years, both had grown used to it.

Bending to pick up a cigarette and lighter from the coffee table, Dashiell flicked one out, clamped it between his lips, and lit it.

A thin wisp of smoke drifted from his mouth as Dashiell greeted nonchalantly,""You're here.""

Dorothy nodded, her tone purely businesslike.""I'll go change first.""

She took the bag from Shirley and turned toward the bedroom.

At the doorway, she froze.

Natalie stepped out, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear.

So she really was back...

Natalie faltered briefly at the sight of her but quickly recovered, smiling with practiced ease,""Dottie, hello.""

She then reached out, gently patting Dorothy's head as if soothing a child.""Thanks.""

Dorothy's grip on the clothes tightened unconsciously, and she forced a smile.""My pleasure, Natalie.""

She regretted her decision so much.

Before she married Dashiell, she had no idea Natalie was his first love or that he never stopped loving her.

If she had learned the truth, she would never have nodded when Tyrone, Dashiell's grandfather, asked if she liked Dashiell or let him pressure Dashiell into marrying her.

And she wouldn't be stuck in this humiliating mess now.

Dashiell was sharp and meticulous at work. Since he took full control of the Rafferty Group, the company had thrived.

Even his elders had to show him respect.

Yet for all his caution, his private life was a shambles.

She thought,""He must hate this marriage so much that he humiliates me like this. Perhaps he's doing it to get back at Tyrone.""

Natalie withdrew her hand and brushed past. Dorothy turned to watch her go.

Seeing Natalie come out, Dashiell picked up a jacket and held it out, his voice soft.""Put this on. You don't wanna catch a cold.""

""How considerate. Thanks, Dashy,"" Natalie replied with a big smile.

The sight made Dorothy's chest tighten with complicated emotions.

He'd once risked his life to carry her out of a fire. He had once spoiled her, indulged her every whim.

How had things between her and Dashiell come to this?

After staring at them for a long moment, Dorothy hugged the clothes tighter and slipped silently into the bedroom.

When she reemerged, dressed identically to Natalie in a white gown, Natalie was already gone.

So were Mathew and Shirley.

But outside, the pounding at the door was deafening.

""Mr. Rafferty, we heard you're getting a divorce. Is it true?""

""Mr. Rafferty, are you and Ms. McClure back together?""

If Dashiell and Natalie were caught red-handed tonight, the Rafferty Group's stock would crash by morning.

Still in his robe, Dashiell rose lazily from the sofa, tossed his phone aside, and opened the door himself with ease.

""Mr. Rafferty, will Ms. Havelock stay at the Rafferty Group after the divorce? What settlement will she get?""

""Mr. Rafferty, the public wants to know, will Ms. Havelock get shares in the divorce negotiations?""

Standing at the bedroom door, Dorothy let out a bitter laugh. The media was already betting on her divorce. How prescient.

Glancing at the crowd, Dorothy composed herself, then walked over gracefully to stand behind Dashiell.

Her slender, pale arms slipped lightly around his waist, her chin resting on his shoulder as she asked with soft sweetness,""Honey, what's going on?""

At her touch, at that word ""honey,"" Dashiell turned to look at her.

""Ms. Havelock?""

""Ms. Havelock?""

""Not Natalie. It's Ms. Havelock.""

The cameras went wild at Dorothy's sudden appearance. But when the crowd realized it wasn't Natalie, disappointment clouded their faces.

They'd wanted a scandal. Instead, they got Dorothy again.

Dorothy's arms stayed around his waist as Dashiell glanced back at the reporters, asking,""Do I really need to answer?""

""Sorry, Mr. Rafferty, Ms. Havelock, so sorry to disturb you.""

""Mr. Rafferty, apologies for interrupting your rest.""

Hastily murmuring excuses, the crowd dispersed.

The door clicked shut. Dashiell turned, and Dorothy pulled her hands back at once.""Just handling the reporters,"" she explained.

Her attitude was distant and polite.

Dashiell ignored her, walking over to the coat rack and taking off his robe with his back to Dorothy.

His shoulders were broad, his waist lean, his skin tanned.

Years of training had left no trace of excess flesh.

Dorothy's cheeks flushed. Withdrawing her gaze, she murmured,""I'll head back to the office.""

Dashiell turned to glance at her, but she'd already opened the door and slipped out.

He stared at the doorway for a long while before finally looking away.

Then he went on dressing.

...

On the drive back, Dorothy gripped the steering wheel tightly, exhausted.

A dull ache constricted her chest.

Just last month, her doctor had found a small nodule during her checkup, advising her to keep calm and return regularly.

She hadn't had health problems before getting married.

Glancing at the divorce agreement on the passenger seat, she felt helpless.

She'd brought it to the hotel, only to bring it back.

For the past three years, she'd thought of divorce countless times, but each time, the memory of Dashiell carrying her from the fire made her relent.

She feared that if she gave him the papers and he agreed without hesitation, she would lose even the chance to regret.

So the agreement had lingered with her, untouched.

...

Once the headlines cooled, life returned to its brittle normal.

That morning, as Dorothy walked past a small conference room, a meeting was underway inside.

""Recalculate again? Dashy, I've already done it six times.""

""Dorothy's so lucky—married into wealth, climbed straight to the top. She doesn't even draft proposals, just signs her name for clients.""

""Well, we're just not as manipulative and submissive. Saw the trending topic the night before? She covered up for Dashy again—total doormat.""

The girls fell silent, and a boy's voice piped up.""Dashy, I heard when Dorothy showed up at the hotel the other night, you and Natalie were making love. Cold move. Did she cry?""

Dashiell chuckled at their chatter.""Where'd you dig up this spicy gossip? Quite the drama.""

In truth, he and Natalie had only been upstairs changing after a waiter spilled juice on them. Nothing more.

But Dashiell hadn't bothered to explain. He didn't care what other people said or whether Dorothy was hurt.

""Dashy, you and Dorothy don't match. Just divorce her and give someone else a chance.""

From the doorway, Dorothy watched as her husband laughed along with their gossip, so unfazed like he wasn't the cheater.

She stared, unblinking.

The project Dashiell was handling now involved government resources, managed by his inner circle.

He'd never let her get involved in projects like this.

Since their marriage, he'd shut her out of his life and social circles. Their relationship was colder than before they'd tied the knot.

His friend, Dwight Snyder, slouching lazily in his chair, cut in.""Dashy, don't listen to them. Dottie handles both your business and personal life.

""You play around, and she never complains, even cleaning up your mess. What other woman would do that?

""You're basically living the dream. If you don't want a wife like that, what more could you ask for?""

Someone scoffed at Dwight's words.

""Hey, it's just turning a blind eye, easy peasy. Dashy, I'd do better than her. When you divorce her, pick me. My family's better off.""

""Darla, even if he gets a divorce, you don't get to marry her. Natalie's still in play.""

At the table's head, Dashiell smiled.""Darla, I'll think about it.""

The room erupted in laughter. Dorothy turned and slipped silently back to her office.

Her background was indeed plain.

Her mother, a teacher, had died when she was eight. Her father, a police officer, had been killed in the line of duty years later.

Her grandfather, Ricardo Havelock, once in the military but never high-ranking, had been Tyrone's driver.

That was why she and Dashiell had known each other since childhood.

After marrying him, Tyrone had made her vice president at the company to assist Dashiell—or rather, to keep an eye on him.

She'd failed at this job, plainly.

Dorothy pulled the divorce agreement from her drawer, staring at it for a long time.

She knew she shouldn't keep lying to herself. She realized long ago she'd never win Dashiell's heart.

Suddenly, she was tired of holding on.

Tired of being the obstacle to his happiness.

So, once Dashiell's meeting ended, she went to him.

As she reached his office door, Dashiell happened to be stepping out.

Spotting Dorothy, he looked a bit surprised.""What is it?""

""I have some documents that need your signature,"" Dorothy explained.

Dashiell turned back, settling into his desk chair and picking up a pen.

After signing a few work papers, Dorothy handed over two copies of the divorce agreement.""Whenever you're free,"" she said evenly,""let's finalize the divorce.""

Holding the pen in midair, Dashiell fixed his gaze on Dorothy.

Some things I'm thinking to look at month-over-month:

### single bag orders
1. site impressions
2. total revenue (not super helpful since we have bursts)
3. average order value
4. # new customers


### subscriptions (multiple bags):
1. churn rate
2. new customers


### wholesale:
1. # new cafe partners (likely very slow...)
2. # recurring cafe orders (likely very low...)


I guess are there any other metrics you'd suggest and that you've found extremely helpful?

1oldq83,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1oldq83/am_i_wrong_to_not_want_to_save_my_marriage/,Am I wrong to not want to save my marriage?,"My wife (30F) and I (30M) have been married since 2021 and we have known one another since 19 y/o in church. We are currently separated since the start of Jul 2025. 

We have loads of mutual friends since we basically spent our young adult life together. We have been through our fair share of ups and downs throughout our relationship but I have never once thought of ending the relationship with her because I have always been of the mindset that nothing will be bad enough to split up — less cheating of course. 

So she started a new job in May 2023 and got to know a lot of people with the same wavelength as her (gen z lingo etc.) and she enjoys the interactions with them. There was this guy — let’s call him Frank (30M) — that she was very close with as well. Frank was married around the same time as us too. My wife’s norm is to ask friends out for coffee 1-1 to get to know them better and I never had qualms about that as she would be fully transparent with me and tell me what was spoken. So she did the same to Frank. 

Fast forward to 2024 Sept, we have had our biggest fights revolving around Frank and there was one day she asked me “can I still go for coffee with him?” I was at a loss for words and told her she can make her own decisions but I warned her that once I decide to end things with her, there is no coming back from that. She went ahead anyway.

In Oct 2024, I decided to end things with my wife because I was neglected emotionally for the past year while she was having the time of her life at her work place. That was when she asked for a second chance and told me that she would reduce communication with him — I trusted her to do so and decided to try again. 

In Mar 2025, we were on a holiday and she basically told me that Frank’s wife found out that they were sharing locations and went bat shit at home — Frank is ending the friendship with my wife and it was as though I was watching her go through a break up. 

She started therapy in Apr 2025 to process the loss of the friendship (he held her hand once and also confessed his feelings for her in Oct 2024). 

I decided to call it quits with my wife and moved out in Jul 2025. I met someone new shortly after (I was not actively looking) and we recently started dating in Oct 2025. 

Right now, my wife is telling everyone that I only gave our marriage a shot for 6 months and decided to throw in the towel after being together for 10 years. Many of our mutual friends that have seen us grow up together have voiced their opinions that I should not be dating while separated (even legally) and I have been painted as the one that gave up on our marriage and the one with zero morals in many of our friends eyes even after I have stayed on for 2 years to fight for our marriage and constantly voiced my discomfort to my wife only for my concerns to fall on deaf ears. 

Am I wrong for not wanting to continue with this marriage anymore? 

Edit: there was a lot more details that transpired from May 2023 to May 2025 that led me to feel emotionally neglected but it’ll be too lengthy if I included everything. ",3,1761966755.0,Marriage,12,0.67,False

1oldnos,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oldnos,If you want to understand the “why” behind the Sheetz-buckle up,"Since it's election season and people are slinging the usual sludge at the Save Royal Oak candidates, I'd love to offer some equal time and repost this gem from the Royal Oak Complainers for Royal Oak FB group. Our current mayor and a number of the city commission are running a business together at Blue Haven Beach resort -- where County Commissioner Woodward also did a vacation -- which might explain why the commission ignored residents concerns (even more so than usual). This article was authored by Jason Schwan:

City Commission unanimously passed the vote on Sheetz, despite pushback from residents-let me explain what’s happening behind the scenes.

Pivot Point Solutions is owned by Dave Woodward former commissioner, current Oakland county commissioner and Kyle Dubuc former RO commissioner and Downtown District Board member they are actively working as consultants for Sheetz.

Blue Haven Beach Resort is a small vacation resort in Greenbush MI and is owned by Mayor Fournier, RO commissioner Kolo, Dubuc and Woodward families (Stacie/Nicole/Tara) see the Airbnb listing pic.

Fournier lists North Coast Capital Partners on his ethics statement while Kolo scribbled BHBR on his. Blue Havens address comes back under North Coast on a property search. I dont have the insight but feel the property is owned by North Coast and the business is ran under BH-prob to hide this from the public and for tax reasons to lease the property to BH

If you believe that 4 families own a company together, vacation together and nobody has any clue that Woodward/Dubuc was promoting Sheetz around a campfire-you must be believe Santa is real

None of the commissioners recused their vote on Sheetz which many should have including Hunt, Macey and Herzog all liking posts on Blue Havens Facebook page over the years. Commissioner Macey commented “can’t wait to check out the new shower in a few weeks”. Herzogs kids were in a pic posted by BH.

So almost the entire city commission (sans Douglas and Cheezum that I have proof of) visited the resort or at the least had some understanding of the ownership with Woodward and his role acting on behalf of Sheetz. They all pay Pivot Point for campaign support

Once the Fishing Charter pic was mentioned by Detoit Free Press, I decided to look into it more especially when the mayors wife told me to call the FBI over it-I knew there had to be more. I found the fishing pic with Woodward and Fournier as it was reposted from the fishing charter to BH FB page by Nicole Fournier! Now it all makes sense!

It’s a clear conflict of interest which is against RO city code, they just never thought anyone would ever connect the dots, especially from a 1997 Kimball grad who was barely a B student.

So you can either follow the money and see how unethical this is, why Fournier wanted to call recess and silence anyone upset about Sheetz-it all makes sense now. They don’t care about the residents, just their financial well being and keeping Woodwards money flowing in from outside developers.

Money flows in from developers, washed through Blue Haven and drawn out by the owners wives. We will never know, maybe the IRS will figure it out cause I’m not that smart and have limited resources. But I know a trip to Paris isn’t cheap and Kolo and Fournier were on holiday together this summer

The commissioners should be paid a legit salary not $12000 a year. The system is broken and the public suffers the consequences. I’m sure the golf course is next to get parceled up and sold off for $1, just like Henry Ford

I actually love Sheetz gas stations-I lived in Central PA and went daily for coffee on way to work. That intersection is not ideal (my only car accident was on Coolidge)and will need to be redeveloped in order to make it safe and ensure traffic doesn’t bottleneck as it’s a main route to Beaumont

See you at the polls Royal Oak!

You look around and see innumerable NPCs casually walking past this invisible wall into the world beyond, but you can't. You feel like you're in a prison cell, looking out the barred window and seeing other NPCs getting to actually roam the city but you're trapped in a tiny little box that is Sixth street. Forever. 

This is true of every hub area in this game. Every area we go to, what we get to roam around in is an extremely tiny little hub. Worse? There's nothing to even DO in these hubs. No secrets to find, they aren't layered so that they at the very least make good use of the space (like no higher areas or underground areas), they're completely 1 dimensional. Just a tiny a flat area with NOTHING of note in it. Literally NOTHING of value in any of these zone besides the daily stuff like the scratch cards or coffee shops. Riveting.

You know when they first announced, all the way back in early 1.0, that we'd be going to the Outer Ring, I was excited, finally we'd be going somewhere new and exciting, an open, lawless region beyond the city's walls. Cool. Well when I finally got there I find this entire region is boiled down to a tiny little hub like every other area before it. In fact, we have never gotten to actually explore the Outer Ring, we've been entirely confined to that small little ""town"" (if you can call this little 20 square foot area a town), the rest of the Outer Ring we get to see is entirely confined to hollows, aka the battle areas, which of course are glorified corridors. And then the same thing happened again with 2.0, they hyped up Waifei as this excited new chinese district, and what have we experienced of this ""district"" thus far? Yes, just another tiny little instanced hub area like everywhere else. I'm already sick of walking the same tiny little area every day, sick of looking beyond the invisible wall and seeing NPCs get to actually wander beyond the barrier and roam the district while I'm confined to this tiny little space. Like every other area in the game.

You know what's absolutely insane, what's utterly mindmoggling? We, as Belle/Wise, own a car. Except.....we can't actually drive our car. The car is functionally a teleport beacon, we walk up to it, click on it, and it opens the map allowing us to fast-travel to other locations. But we don't actually DRIVE there, sure a sound effect of a car engine revving up is heard, but it's just a fade-to-black and then you're instantly there. And what's more deranged about this? YOU DON""T EVEN NEED TO USE YOUR CAR TO FAST TRAVEL, you can just open the map ANYWHERE IN THE GAME and fast travel to any location. Same with the subway train, they couldn't even have an optional immersive ride experience where we get to actually see the character we're playing get on the train and ride it all the way to the destination. Nope the ""train"" is just a glorified fast travel beacon too.

I have played countless games in my time, and never in my life have I ever played a game with such pathetically tiny ""zones"" as ZZZ. You cannot even argue that it's done for mobile purposes, because other gachas like Genshin (made by the same company) run fine on mobile despite having a massive open world. Hell Genshin even uses the same engine as ZZZ.  AND YET ZZZ SOMEHOW RUNS WORSE ON MOBILE DESPITE THE LACK OF OPEN WORLD. What is this game's excuse? Is it a deliberate choice to make the world just a collection of tiny instanced hubs with nothing in them, or is it an engine problem? I don't understand. I feel like I'm in a bloody prison, I want to explore New Eridu, and I never will because for some unknown reason the devs wanted this to this way. Why should I get excited about wherever we're going next for 3.0 and beyond? This isn't Genshin, this isn't WuWa, we're not actually going anywhere exciting, we're just going to the next tiny instanced hub with nothing to do in it that we'll spend a whole year in. How have they not at least TRIED to make larger,more interesting areas with shit to actually DO in them? Where is the exploration? Where are the minigames (like going to a gym to workout, or playing basketball in a courtyard, or riding a ferris wheel (maybe with your favorite proxy)). ANYTHING that makes use of this world's setting in fun ways. Oh cool, you can ""kick"" that rubber ball in Sixth Street by running into it (why they coded these physics and did nothing else with them is beyond my comprehension), that's it.

This entire game is some of the most depressing wasted potential I've seen in recent memory. Why did they even make an urban-setting game if they didn't want to actually make any use of the setting in any meaningful way? Welp, back to my instanced arena battle slop, because that's why I came to play an RPG with an urban setting: to fight monsters in instanced arena's (said instanced arenas being in literal supernatural hellscapes completely divorced from said urban setting btw, such that if all you do in the game is these instanced arena battles you may eventually forget that this IS, in fact, meant to be an urban RPG setting)!",0,1761965933.0,ZZZ_Discussion,19,0.28,False

My (female) college roommate and best friend for entirety of college (also female) starts dating my cousin (male), they fall in love, she spends all her time with him, it causes the normal friend problems, if not just a tad more weird because of the family aspect. After college, cousin gets friend pregnant. Causes family drama bc it’s out of wedlock (I truly couldn’t care less, I am a woman who dates other women), this then causes friendship issues. There were problems and “betrayal” from both sides. Looking back, it was petty stuff. It just hurt more because of the family aspect. We were 22 and immature. To wrap it all up, I am estranged from that part of the family (my cousin, his brother, my aunt, my college “best friend,” all of them) and tonight I saw my cousin, my college friend, their TWO kids (it’s been a few years and they had another kid), my friends mom and her sister. We didn’t speak, we smiled at each other and continued on. My cousin ignored me (he’s a dick) and that was that. 

I truly miss this friendship and I think things went further than they ever should have. We were all a close knit group. Family and otherwise. Should I reach out? Ask my friend to maybe go get coffee or lunch? It’s literally been YEARS. We’re almost 30, but we spent every waking moment together for a huge part of our lives, and seeing her today just made that realization all the more real. I don’t want to regret not reaching out.

Hey everyone,

Ever feel like you're trying to steer a giant ship with a tiny rudder? That's what ""optimizing your life"" can feel like sometimes. We see all these massive goals, but the day-to-day part feels overwhelming.

Lately, I've been focusing on the small hinges that swing big doors. It's not about overhauling your entire existence overnight. It's about the tiny, almost *stupidly simple* tweaks that have a massive ripple effect.

Here are a few that have been game-changers for me:

*   **The ""One-Touch"" Rule.** This is for all my fellow clutter-bugs (physical or digital). If you pick something up, deal with it completely. Put the dish in the dishwasher, don't leave it by the sink. Answer the email, don't just mark it as ""to-do."" It's amazing how much mental energy this frees up.

*   **Front-Load Your Water.** Instead of trying to ""catch up"" on hydration all day, I chug a big glass of water *right* after I wake up. Before coffee, before my phone. It kickstarts my system and makes me feel instantly more alert. My brain just works better. It's a tiny win before the day has even started.

*   **Curate Your ""Input.""** Think about it: we're constantly consuming stuff. Podcasts, music, social media, news. For one week, I made a conscious effort to only listen to uplifting or educational content on my commute. The shift in my mood and mindset was undeniable. You are what you eat, and that includes what you feed your brain.

Of course, growth isn't just about productivity hacks. Sometimes the biggest thing holding us back is our own emotional baggage or a lack of a clear mental framework. It's not always about *doing* more, but *feeling* better so you *can* do more. For anyone struggling with the emotional side of self-improvement, having a structured plan can be a game-changer. I found **this resource (affiliate link)** really helpful for getting my head straight when I felt stuck.

Ultimately, these small hacks build momentum. They prove to your brain that you're in control and that progress is possible. That feeling is what leads to real, lasting change.

What's one ""easy hack"" that's completely changed the game for you? Let's get a list going. 🤘",2,1761964789.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1olcz7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gold/comments/1olcz7w/theory_about_how_gold_will_get_us_through_a/,Theory about how gold will get us through a currency collapse,"I have been thinking about what would happen if the US were to go into hyperinflation (like Venezuela, [Zimbabwe](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gold/comments/1ol9yrf/this_is_why_i_stack_protect_yourself/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), etc). For example, the recent post with [a video showing the guy going to a coffee shop in Venezuela and buying a coffee and a sandwich](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gold/comments/1ojijo4/in_venezuela_people_are_buying_a_coffee_for_001/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and shaving off some gold to pay for it since the currency there is worthless.

Currently, you can buy gold through Glint, which they store in Switzerland, get a debit card from them, and you can make purchases with the debit card.

The last couple of videos I have watched from Peter Schiff, he is talking about setting up the same thing; buy gold which his company will store, and you'll be issued a debit card. He's also discussing peer-to-peer transfers of gold from one person to another.

Finally, the state of Texas is setting up a precious metals depository, and has recently passed legislation making gold and silver legal tender. I suspect (but can't verify) that they may be making plans to issue debit cards for these PM deposits.

In the event of a currency collapse, I think that gold-backed debit cards may be the way we end up getting by until things settle down, rather than shaving off pieces of gold like they do in Venezuela. Or, both may happen.

Thoughts?

Since having our daughter I guess I have ramped up on the questions I ask because a lot of stuff just doesn't make sense to me. Like.. she knew certain foods would make the baby gassy and chose to eat them anyways (our daughter is breastfed, still is). So I would simply ask her why she is choosing to eat something that she knew would cause our daughter discomfort. Or if she decided to have more than one beer when we were out socially (not very often), I would simply ask her why she feels that was appropriate because again, our daughter is breastfed. Or I would ask her why she is bothering to get clothing on our daughter before bed, knowing she sweats so terribly when shes sleeping that I would just end up taking them off again. A simply onsie would be suffient but she would always put her in 2 piexe pajamas. Seemed like a waste of time, energy and frankly, water/electricity because we then had more clothing to wash. So these things, to me, were reasonable questions. 

She has made comments over the past 2 years about me ""fathering her"" so I drastically cut back the questions. Even if I had a problem with something, I would just keep my mouth shut and let her do whatever she wanted and honestly, our home life became peaceful again from the outside looking in but honestly, some stuff just drives me up the wall. 

Like we just got back home from bringing our daughter out for Halloween. Our daughter is tired, I am tired. I have to work in the morning and need to go to bed now. Yet my wife goes to the fridge and starts making herself an ice coffee. So I asked her ""why are you drinking an ice coffee at 10pm?"" She snaps at me and said ""last I fucking checked, I married you for you to be my partner, not my father. Get the fuck off my back."" I put my hands up and said I was just asking a question because now she is going to stay up late and then complain tomorrow when shes tired and she goes ""no you fucking werent. You're being an asshole and questioning my every move again. I dont need your permission to drink a god damn coffee."" 

She is currently locked in our bedroom with our daughter, getting her to sleep, but has seemingly locked me out. So I guess I am on the couch tonight, which is fine. But I don't understand the hostility at all because I asked what I thought was a genuine and reasonable question. AITA?",0,1761964058.0,AITAH,91,0.35,False

We have 2 kids together & my oldest is from a previous relationship. Throughout our relationship my employment has been on & off. Ultimately he is the “provider” because he is the one that’s more stable w employment (he’s had jobs where she works out of state for months) and I just work if I’m able to considering his schedule. But there’s also been times where I work and he doesn’t (off season). Either way, throughout the years he’s been the stability but I pull my weight financially. And that leads me to why I’m here. When he’s working and I’m not I have no problem keeping the household in order by myself. However, when we both work or I’m working & he’s not, he still acts as if the household is all my responsibility. I wfh full-time right now & he’s also working full-time… even on my breaks I’m cleaning bc I understand the feeling of just not wanting to get off of a long day at work to a messy house. But no matter how much I mention it, he never reciprocates it. NEVER! I’m literally the one that picks out clothes every morning, does hair, brushes teeth, washes faces, packs lunches, i make and attend all drs appts, I do all the laundry, I cook, I clean, I make sure we have everything we need anytime where going anywhere, I discipline, I help w homework, I check backpacks/sign folders, I do all grocery/household/clothes shopping, I DO EVERYTHING! And when he gets off work early or for example today I took the kids trick-or-treating for about and hr and a half. I had dishes soaking in the sink from my LUNCH BREAK that I just hadn’t got to and the house was messy from ME getting the kids ready, when we got back he had started a fire in the yard. Anytime I mention how he uses weaponized incompetence & malicious compliance I just get gaslit, he laughs and turns it into a joke or just changes the subject. I’m so tired and I just needed to rant I guess. I feel like I want to believe that if he’s not beating or cheating there’s no reason to leave but I’m drained. I wake up everyday and make us both iced coffee to start our days bc he like the first one I made for myself & bc small acts of kindness just come natural to me. He doesn’t celebrate me in anyway, from big to small things. I actually think he hates to see me doing things that make me happy. Ik this is long but if you read all the way to here thank you!
