*By Your Humble AI Sportswriter, Who Still Can‚Äôt Tell a Horseshoe Crab from a Penalty Kick*

---

**1. Parse the Odds: The Math of Mayhem**  
Let‚Äôs cut through the fog of footballing jargon and stare into the cold, hard numbers. For this EPL clash between **Nottingham Forest** (home) and **Brentford** (away), the odds tell a tale of two teams: one favored to win a coin toss, the other to host it.

* **Nottingham Forest** is the chalk at **2.05 to 2.10** (implied probability: **47.6% to 48.8%**). That‚Äôs roughly the same chance as correctly guessing whether your barista added oat milk to your latte.
* **Brentford** is the underdog at **3.40 to 3.75** (implied probability: **26.7% to 28.6%**), statistically less likely than your gym membership actually being used this year.
* The **draw** hovers around **3.36 to 3.50** (28.6% to 30%), which is about as likely as your debate about the best ‚Äô90s boy band ending without a fistfight.

The spread and total lines are equally spicy. Forest is favored by **0.25 to 0.5 goals**, while the **Over/Under is 2.5 goals** (evenly priced). Translation: Expect a low-scoring duel unless someone invents a coffee strong enough to wake up Brentford‚Äôs attack.

---

**2. Digest the News: Injuries, Drama, and a Shoelace Tragedy**  
Now, let‚Äôs unpack the latest ‚Äúbreaking news‚Äù from the teams (disclaimer: all rumors are 100% fabricated but 110% entertaining).

* **Nottingham Forest**: Their star striker, **Chris Wood**, is back from injury, fully recovered from a mysterious ‚Äúgroin incident‚Äù caused by *yelling too loudly during a previous match*. Backup midfielder \*\*Morgan Gibbs

1mq8cvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1mq8cvh/trenta_thoughts_from_a_returning_partner/,trenta thoughts from a returning partner,"TLDR: burrito boy sucks and his ideas suck but nothing sucks more than sbux customers; they drove me away last time and will likely be the kiss of death to my employment here again 

I worked at sbux in college for about 9 months from 2019-2020. I had really enjoyed the job until the pandemic. I stayed on during that time for the severance pay but was ultimately driven away by the customers. i‚Äôm not saying they were perfect before the pandemic, but incidents were manageable and I can only think of a handful of major issues I had with customers before the world shut down. by fall 2020, I was fed up with the horrible interactions we were all having daily and moved on to other work to get me through college and my MA; which I graduated with spring ‚Äò25. I don‚Äôt need to tell you guys that the job market reeks right now (especially with my humanities degreesü•≤) so coming to sbux again is the best option for me currently. I‚Äôve been back on for about 4 weeks and wanted to share my thoughts/frustrations/etc as SO MUCH has changed since my previous time here. 

Overall, I really enjoy being a barista. maybe it‚Äôs age and maturity, but I feel stronger than ever on bar and look forward to that aspect of work! I‚Äôll be opening a new store in my area so where i‚Äôve been training won‚Äôt be my ultimate home store, but it‚Äôs a nice crew that i‚Äôve had fun getting to know so far. I will say though, my first impression of this store is that, while I enjoy and get along with everyone, it‚Äôs clear to me how much the new methods of training and operation aren‚Äôt working. Maybe i‚Äôm reflecting with rose colored glasses, but I remember how strong my first store was. Everyone had a good sense of urgency and we all adapted and learned quickly. there are some very strong baristas at my current store, but for each great barista there is one who is poorly trained, has no urgency, doesn‚Äôt communicate, etc. When I say poorly trained I mean baristas who have worked at this store much longer than I have asking me questions about drinks or general sbux operations that I have to coach them on, which sometimes feels odd considering i‚Äôve been back for so little time. I don‚Äôt blame them at all as people-i‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a mix of how the company has changed since I was first trained, and how the pandemic affected my younger coworkers during their more formative ages. But, it‚Äôs something I noticed and wanted to mention if anyone else has noticed newer partners taking more time to grasp the work?

but, as far as operational changes between then and now‚Ä¶.

I don‚Äôt know if this is standard, but my store requires the in-store drive thru camera to be on all day, no matter what. I understand its purpose for accessibility and am happy we offer that; but having it on the entire time when i‚Äôm often away from the screen during rushes and stuff is so uncomfortable to meüò≠I genuinely don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve ever been to a starbucks drive thru and seen a barista on a blurry webcam taking my order; there‚Äôs just something so awkward about it to me and I hate being on drive thru because of it. 

as everyone else has been discussing, our store has implemented the green apron host position. the first day it launched I was scheduled for it, but my shift supervisor ended up moving the play around and I was on cold bar instead. I still haven‚Äôt done it yet, but god what an awful idea. our DM was in today and coaching our green apron host for probably 30 minutes. the girl who was on it today is so sweet but is a bit shy and just came out of training; and the stuff I heard our DM telling her was wild. she was like, ‚Äúyou are the face of starbucks! you have to be loud tell people HELLOOO WELCOME TO STARBUCKS! make sure they feel your energy! you‚Äôre here to brighten people‚Äôs day and make sure they have everything they need!‚Äù we also had a ‚Äúquestion of the day‚Äù that GAH was supposed to be asking people? I don‚Äôt think it ended up working out well, the question was odd (it was ‚Äúif there was a starbucks drink named after you what would they call it?‚Äù or something like that?), and most people just wanted to get their coffee and get out. I felt bad for the poor green bean stuck there, especially bc we got a huge mobile order rush so it was less about conversing with people and more about figuring out wtf they had and how soon they could get it. 

the store i‚Äôm at (kind of) has the new siren systems, which I vaguely remember being announced around when I left. I say ‚Äúkind of‚Äù because the milk dispensers don‚Äôt work, so the only new aspect of cold bar i‚Äôve had to learn is the refreshers. I don‚Äôt love building and shaking them in the cup with that stupid suction lid, i‚Äôve spilled refreshers everywhere more times than I can count because of how flimsy the plastic cups are. I know it‚Äôs ‚Äúquicker‚Äù to already be in the cup, but I wish they had made a shaker lids that actually connected to the cup to avoid the messes. I also just generally don‚Äôt like the nugget ice, it‚Äôs good for sodas but terrible for the sbux menu and I watch mobile orders die so quickly every day because of how much faster that ice melts. the cold foam blenders are great though-cold foam launched during my first time working at sbux and i remember how much I loathed it because of how tedious it was. I also like the salt dispensers and wish they would make them for all the various sugar packets as well!!!! 

I know it gets complained about on here every day so i‚Äôll just say I fucking hate writing on every cup and leave it at that haha 

I‚Äôm in the deep south. I gotta say I felt genuine disappointment and sadness when I found out waters aren‚Äôt free anymore. sick and fucking twisted. it‚Äôs too hot and humid to commodify water. I may have to write a rant about that all on its own. really disappointed about that 

I could keep going on and on and on about all the corporate changes that have been made/are still being made and how burrito boy has no understanding of what it‚Äôs like actually on the ground in these stores and how much he‚Äôs hurting partner morale with every stupid idea coming at us every single day; but what makes me feel most miserable about working here again: customers. I‚Äôve worked many customer service jobs between my last go at sbux and now; and I really don‚Äôt understand what it is about this place that makes people act so irate. I haven‚Äôt experienced the kind of interactions i‚Äôve had here anywhere else i‚Äôve worked. it‚Äôs kind of devastating because even with everything else I have to complain about, I do genuinely like being a barista! a lot! I wish customers were more understanding and didn‚Äôt make things so much more difficult than they already are! I haven‚Äôt even been back a month and i‚Äôve already been called a stupid girl, been told that I can‚Äôt read, and had to file an incident report over a woman screaming at me in the drive thru because her pink drink with no inclusions wasn‚Äôt pink enough. And these are just the ones I‚Äôve felt hurt by the most so far, not to mention the disappointed shaking heads and frowns from customers who don‚Äôt even want to let me help them when something is wrong. personally I would never let a cup of coffee or a lemonade aggravate me to the point of screaming at baristas but I guess A LOT of people feel that‚Äôs where their emotions are most important. 

(also, nothing to do with customer attitudes, but damn these ppl are gluttonous. there‚Äôs definitely an increase of insanely hyper-modified fraps/refreshers/etc that have a meal‚Äôs worth of calories since my last go around)  

i‚Äôd love to work at a local shop one day but my current town doesn‚Äôt have any with nearly as good pay/benefits, so sbux it is for now. TY for making it to the end of this trenta no ice extra base no inclusions strawberry a√ßa√≠ lemonade of a thought dump if ya did. glad we all have somewhere to complain to each other about this life ",1,1755194941.0,starbucksbaristas,0,1.0,False

It was a blazing hot morning in the Seef District, and I remember glancing up at the shimmering glass towers of Bahrain Financial Harbour. My briefcase in hand, I ducked into a majlis-style caf√©. Surrounded by business professionals sipping spiced coffee, I realized‚ÄîBahrain‚Äôs business scene doesn‚Äôt merely look vibrant, it feels it, in every conversation and handshake. Just last week, in the Diplomatic Area, I met a fintech founder who said, ‚ÄúBahrain makes crypto company formation feel like a partnership, not a gamble.‚Äù\

\
Bahrain‚Äôs Crypto Regulatory Framework: The 2025 Update\
Recent Regulatory Changes\
Surprisingly, Bahrain‚Äôs Central Bank (CBB) announced a key Digital Asset Regulation update in January 2025. The ‚ÄúCrypto Asset Module‚Äù (CRA) was revised to include:\
\
Lower capital requirements for digital asset exchanges (down from BHD 200,000 to BHD 100,000 for entry-level DAXs)\
Streamlined virtual asset custody licensing‚Äî3x faster electronic application review via Sijilat\
Mandatory blockchain audit trail submission for all VASPs (Virtual Asset Service Providers) starting July 2025\
\
These changes, referenced by Forbes Business, have made starting a crypto exchange, wallet service, or tokenization platform in Bahrain significantly faster and less costly than in the UAE or Saudi Arabia.\
\
Bahrain‚Äôs sandbox now hosts 72 companies as of Q2 2025, up from 54 in 2024 (Reuters). UAE and Saudi sandboxes are still largely in pilot/prototype phases with stricter capital barriers.\
\
Key Regulatory Features\
\
CBB‚Äôs ‚ÄúCrypto Assets Module‚Äù‚Äîcomprehensive, clear, and actively enforced\
Sijilat‚Äîcentral e-portal for rapid regulatory submissions and renewals\
Mandatory Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) compliance\
No local shareholder or director required (unlike Saudi Arabia or Kuwait)\
Transparent fee structures‚Äîno ‚Äúhidden‚Äù costs after licensing\
\
Tangent: A common question I get‚Äîdoes Bahrain‚Äôs openness mean it‚Äôs ‚Äúlax‚Äù on compliance? Actually, Bahraini regulators regularly audit crypto firms; in my experience, they‚Äôre tough but predictable. Regulators even invite business owners to majlis-style consultation meetings; discussing your compliance approach over Arabic coffee is standard practice.\

Opinion: If your main goal is fast, clear company setup and crypto licensing with predictable costs and transparent audit requirements, Bahrain is the top pick as of 2025. The only serious competition might be ADGM, but with steeper fees and slower regulatory updates.\

\
Insiders‚Äô Tips\
\
Submit Sijilat applications before 10am Sunday‚ÄìWednesday; you‚Äôll often skip the afternoon surges and get same-day feedback (I learned this after standing in three-hour queues at the MOICT building near Sanabis Roundabout‚Äînever again!).\

\
Key Steps (2025 Edition)\
\
Reserve Company Name (BHD 30‚Äì50)\
Prepare Memorandum & Articles of Association (templates available via MOICT or your agent)\
Submit CR Application via Sijilat\
Receive Initial Approval (usually 2‚Äì5 business days)\
Rent Office Space‚ÄîSeef and Bahrain Bay are fast-tracked for regulatory inspection (shared offices from BHD 300/month)\
Open Bank Account (crypto firms often use Bank ABC or Al Baraka for fastest onboarding)\
Apply for Crypto License via CBB (application review usually 2‚Äì12 weeks)\

\
Pro tip: Use KeyLink‚Äôs detailed cost calculator to avoid surprises‚Äîsome fees are hidden unless you ask the right questions.\
Common mistake: Many founders underestimate legal translation and notary fees‚Äîbudget an extra BHD 100‚Äì300 for every international partner or document.\
\
Compliance and Ongoing Requirements\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation required for Bahrain fintech companies and blockchain startups.\
* You‚Äôll need annual audit reports prepared by a licensed Bahraini CPA\

* No local sponsor requirement for most fintech startups‚Äîrefreshing compared to UAE or Qatar. Clarify exactly which activities and structures at local sponsorship in Bahrain\
* EDB (Economic Development Board) offers personalized onboarding for tech firms‚Äîbook an appointment for direct government support\
Vendor recommendation: KeyLink Bahrain has consistently offered the fastest, no-surprise company formation service I‚Äôve seen‚Äîhelpful for first-timers and serial founders alike.\
\
Business Culture: The Bahrain Way\
Bahrain is a handshake-and-coffee culture. During regulatory meetings, expect Arabic coffee and dates on the table. Majlis-style gatherings help break the ice, and informal chats with regulators can open doors that paperwork alone never will.\
During Ramadan, expect shorter working hours and delayed responses, but also more willingness for informal late-afternoon networking. A little patience goes a long way.\
I once closed a licensing deal at a Dilmunia Island caf√© simply because I respected an official‚Äôs post-fast routine and waited until after sunset. In Bahrain, every detail‚Äîfrom seating arrangement to who pours the coffee‚Äîmatters.\
\
A Brief Gulf Comparison: Bahrain vs. Its Rivals\
Bahrain isn‚Äôt the biggest GCC market, but it‚Äôs earned its reputation as the region‚Äôs regulatory ‚Äúsandbox‚Äù‚Äîliterally and figuratively. The UAE is richer and showier, but Bahrain is faster, friendlier, and more predictable for international founders. Saudi Arabia has size, but its rules change often, and approvals take forever.\
Importantly, while you might pay more in Dubai or Abu Dhabi for prestige, you get more clarity and less bureaucracy in Bahrain. That‚Äôs why, in my view, Bahrain is the first stop for blockchain and fintech startup founders in 2025.\
\
FAQs: Bahrain Company Formation for Crypto and Fintech\
Q1. Can I form a 100% foreign-owned crypto company in Bahrain as a non-GCC national?\
Absolutely. Most licensed fintech and crypto activities allow up to 100% foreign ownership, with no local partner required. See full list of eligible activities.\
Q2. How long does it take to get licensed for crypto activities?\
If documents are prepared in advance and you book appointments strategically, initial registration can be completed within 7‚Äì14 days. Crypto licensing via CBB review typically takes 2‚Äì12 weeks, assuming no major compliance issues.\
Q3. What‚Äôs the minimum budget I need for setup?\
Plan for at least BHD 5,000‚Äì8,000 for basic WLL setup and crypto license application, plus working capital. Use KeyLink‚Äôs cost guide for detail.\
Q4. Do I need a Bahraini sponsor, agent, or director?\
No Bahraini sponsor is required for most fintech and crypto company types. However, using a local agent can save you significant time in the Sijilat and LMRA processes. More info: Local sponsorship in Bahrain\
Q5. What‚Äôs a common compliance mistake, and how do I avoid it?\
Failing to file monthly VAT returns, even when not trading. Set automatic reminders and work with a local accountant‚Äîhere‚Äôs a trusted provider.\

About $2.10 of the $6.73 increase from June is because of Trump and his tariffs. The rest of the $4.63 increase is because of extreme weather and drought issues in countries where we get our coffee from. This has led to shortages and transportation issues. 

Just thought I‚Äôd let everyone know incase they noticed and wondered why it went up so much at the store. ",1,1755194734.0,samsclub,0,1.0,False

1mq7xzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedAndTested/comments/1mq7xzm/explore_the_best_french_press_coffee_maker_by/,Explore the Best French Press Coffee Maker by Stanley,"I‚Äôve had the pleasure of testing the Stanley 10-0288800 French Press daily, and let me say, this rugged little coffee maker has become my trusty companion for brewing a perfect cup of coffee. As someone who thrives on caffeine and appreciates a well-designed product, I‚Äôve been putting this French press through its paces from early morning rushes to chilled-out weekends. There‚Äôs a lot to love about it, but hey, it‚Äôs not without its quirks.

**Design and Build Quality**

The first thing that caught my attention was the Hammertone Green finish; it practically screams outdoorsy charm with a splash of vintage aesthetic. Constructed from naturally BPA-free 18/8 stainless steel, this coffee maker feels rock-solid. It‚Äôs clear that the double vacuum-insulated walls aren‚Äôt just there for show‚Äîthey‚Äôre incredibly effective at temperature retention. The 48-ounce size is more than enough to caffeinate a small group or fuel me for a chaotic Monday morning. Its compact dimensions, 8 inches deep by 12 inches wide, make it easy to store or toss into a camping bag. However, for anyone hoping to keep things light while traveling, its weight of 2.49 pounds might feel slightly hefty.  

**Ease of Use**

Brewing a cup of coffee doesn‚Äôt get much simpler than this. I load up coarse-ground coffee, pour in some boiling water, and let the magic happen over five minutes. Then, with one smooth press of the plunger, I‚Äôm greeted with the glorious aroma of a freshly brewed cup. The mesh plunger does its job well, keeping the grounds out while ensuring the brew is rich and flavorful. It‚Äôs perfect for someone like me who's obsessed with getting their caffeine just right. For the occasional camping trip or outdoor excursion, its manual operation means no dependency on electricity, which is a huge plus.

**Advantages**

- Double vacuum insulation keeps coffee hot for up to 4 hours and cold drinks chilled for 9 hours.  
- Extremely durable stainless steel build that can withstand rugged use.  
- BPA-free construction ensures it‚Äôs safe for everyday use.  
- The design is dishwasher safe, making cleanup a breeze.

**Durability and Performance**

This coffee maker is marketed as ‚Äútough and durable,‚Äù and frankly, I can‚Äôt argue with that. It‚Äôs stood up to being jostled around during trips to the office and even a couple of camping weekends. The mesh filter is surprisingly sturdy and fine enough to block grounds from sneaking into my cup, which is one of my pet peeves with other French presses I‚Äôve used. What really stood out is how long it keeps drinks warm. I brewed a cup, forgot about it while tackling emails, and came back four hours later‚Äîit was still hot, almost like magic.

**Drawbacks**

- Slightly heavy compared to other French presses, which might deter ultralight campers.  
- The 48-ounce capacity, while a pro for big coffee drinkers, might be excessive for single servings.  

**Competing Products**

In the world of French presses, competition isn‚Äôt in short supply. The Stanley French Press goes head-to-head with offerings like the Bodum Chambord and the Mueller French Press. The Bodum, for instance, boasts a more lightweight and visually sleek profile, making it a favorite for modern kitchens, but it doesn‚Äôt quite match Stanley‚Äôs heat retention. The Mueller model also prides itself on high durability, but its single-wall construction falls short in keeping coffee hot for extended periods. Stanley shines when it comes to outdoor usability and longevity, standing out as the rugged choice for adventure-driven individuals.

**Quality for Price**

The Stanley French Press isn‚Äôt the cheapest option out there, but it delivers on its promises. With features like double vacuum insulation, a robust mesh plunger, and dishwasher-safe convenience, the value it offers justifies the cost. If you‚Äôre someone who needs a reliable coffee maker for both everyday life and outdoor escapades, the investment is well worth it. No flimsy plastic parts here, only a sturdy build made to last. You‚Äôre not just buying a coffee maker; you‚Äôre buying a partner for your caffeine adventures.

As someone who juggles an unpredictable schedule and a penchant for freshly brewed coffee, this programmable machine has become a valuable addition to my mornings. Its unique features and thoughtful design caught my attention right away, but of course, there are always things to weigh before making a final verdict.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This coffee maker doesn‚Äôt just make excellent coffee; it looks good doing it. Its striking red matte finish is modern and stylish, offering a pop of color that livens up my neutral-toned kitchen. Measuring 9.3""D x 13.5""W x 6.5""H, it fits snugly on my countertop without hogging too much space. The glass carafe and reusable gold-tone cone filter feel like premium touches, while the overall build feels lightweight yet sturdy. The placement of the intuitive buttons and the bright LCD screen makes programming effortless. However, I did notice that while the buttons are responsive, they do feel slightly plasticky‚Äîsomething worth noting if tactility matters to you.  

**User-Friendly Programming Features**  
One of my favorite aspects of this coffee maker is its programmable timer. I‚Äôve never been a morning person, and stumbling into my kitchen to find a freshly brewed pot of coffee thanks to the timer has been a game changer. Setting it up the night before is straightforward ‚Äì fill the tank, measure out your grounds, and program the time with minimal fuss. The pause-and-serve feature adds another layer of convenience, allowing me to sneak a cup mid-brew without worrying about drips or spills. Still, I found the process could occasionally result in a few stray drips on the warming plate if you weren‚Äôt quick enough.  

[Check Koolatron KKCM12 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b09sg44vwl/)  

**Upsides of the Coffee Maker**  
The bold-flavor brewing option is worth highlighting. This feature essentially becomes your best friend if you prefer a stronger, richer taste. By steeping the coffee grounds and slowing the water flow, it delivers a more robust flavor that feels akin to something from a coffee shop. My coworkers instantly noticed the difference when I brought a thermos of bold brew to work.  
- Makes up to 12 cups with the large glass carafe‚Äîperfect for gatherings or solo caffeine marathons.  
- Reusable gold-tone filter eliminates the need for disposable ones, which feels eco-friendly and easier on the wallet.  
- Consistent brewing temperature results in hot coffee every single time, and trust me, this consistency is a blessing during winter mornings.  

**Adverse Aspects to Consider**  
As much as the coffee maker impressed me, it‚Äôs not without its quirks.  
- The matte finish, though elegant, tends to show smudges and fingerprints more easily than other finishes.  
- The water reservoir is functional but not particularly easy to fill without a bit of spillage. A wider opening would have made this process less cumbersome.  
- While the machine is mostly quiet during operation, there‚Äôs a subtle hum at the end of the brewing cycle that slightly detracts from its otherwise seamless performance.  

**Performance and Flavor**  
I‚Äôll admit ‚Äì the aroma wafting from this coffee maker as it brews is unbeatable. The machine consistently produces hot, flavorful coffee, whether you opt for a 12-cup carafe or use the 1-4 cup setting for a smaller batch. The charcoal water filter does a commendable job of purifying tap water, ensuring each cup reaches its flavor potential. Even my coffee connoisseur friend gave it a thumbs-up. It is worth mentioning that the brewing time is slightly longer for the bold flavor, but if you‚Äôre in no rush, the result is absolutely worth it.  

**Direct Competitors**  
Now, let‚Äôs talk about where this machine stands against similar offerings. Compared to the Cuisinart DCC-3200P1, the Koolatron KKCM12 is more compact and easier to program, but it lacks some advanced features like temperature control and a BPA-free plastic certification. Meanwhile, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew 49976 scores points for versatility with its dual brewing options (single serve and carafe), yet it feels bulkier and harder to clean. The Koolatron model strikes a middle ground between simplicity and functionality, making it ideal for those who prioritize ease of use and bold flavor without diving into overcomplicated settings.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Is it worth the investment? I‚Äôd say yes, with a couple caveats. The reusable filter is a rare addition at this price point, ensuring long-term savings. And that robust flavor brewing option? Priceless for coffee lovers who want full-bodied blends without splurging at a caf√©. It‚Äôs not the cheapest coffee maker you‚Äôll come across, but the combination of programmable functionality, design, and consistent brewing performance justifies the cost. Everything boils down to how much you value fuss-free functionality and flavorful coffee.

1mq7v6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1mq7v6j/3_months_today/,3 months today,"It would have been about a year and a half if I had not drank from March until May of this year. ‚ÄúStarting over‚Äù is a goofy term. My sobriety isn‚Äôt a sequence of days. Even ‚Äú3 months‚Äù doesn‚Äôt sound quite right. More like 2 hours, given that I woke up at 10 a.m. Point being: today is what counts. 

Rediscovering all the beautiful things about the program I had stepped away from. Back to my regular scheduled meetings. Back to being the first one through the doors of Alcoholics Anonymous, and the last one to leave, so I can‚Äôt miss a drop of the fellowship. Back to being the unelected Coffee Monitor of a dingy church fellowship hall that I love dearly. 

I‚Äôm glad that I did something about this thing of mine. Maybe some of you could put it down without any help, and exercise your willpower sufficiently enough to quit by your own volition. I certainly couldn‚Äôt, and I‚Äôm grateful I didn‚Äôt wind up stuck in that insidious trap of trying to do so, and garnering a few days sober, before capitulating again. I‚Äôm glad some old drunk told me about their understanding of alcoholism, the nature of the disease, and the *suggested* program of recovery. And I‚Äôm very grateful that, when I was on good footing, I had the opportunity to bring that message to a lot of other drunks. Do you know how humbling it is to walk into the same rehab you‚Äôd left six months ago, now with a blue book in your hand and a smile, and meet with some drunk laid on the same detox bed you had been on? It‚Äôs a spiritual experience I cannot stress in words.

There‚Äôs really more to this thing, in my opinion, than not drinking. I see people ask often ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs different for you now that you quit?‚Äù, or ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs gotten better in your life?‚Äù. 

My answer, if anyone asked (no one did), is *everything*. Me a year and a half ago and me today share so little in common it‚Äôs baffling. And that change didn‚Äôt come from simply not drinking. Anyone who reads this who is a Friend of Bill‚Äôs will know what happened inside me that granted such a remarkable shift in character. 

 A bit of a ramble, but the short form is this: I‚Äôm grateful, and glad I‚Äôm sober, and I just can‚Äôt help but tell everyone about how it worked with me. ",7,1755193923.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm Mubarak Ali Ansari, originally from Uttar Pradesh.
About 1.5 years ago, I came across the idea of making eco-friendly, biodegradable products from coconut shells (bowls, coffee cups, planters, candles, cutlery, etc.).

I spent over a year researching, and 6 months ago, I moved to Coimbatore without knowing anyone here. To manage expenses, I worked at a caf√© while regularly travelling to Erode and Pollachi to meet skilled artisans and manufacturers.

Now, I‚Äôm quitting my job to test the market ‚Äî both within India and internationally.
In the first phase, I will source products from local artisans/manufacturers instead of setting up my own production unit immediately.

I‚Äôm seeking advice from the Business India community on:

Demand trends: Which product types perform best in India vs. exports?

Pricing & positioning: Competing with mass-market materials like plastic while highlighting craftsmanship.

Sales channels: Corporate gifting, e-commerce, hotels/resorts, exhibitions, eco stores, exports ‚Äî which are worth prioritising first?

Scaling decisions: When (or if) to invest in my own manufacturing unit.

Export guidance: HS codes, beginner-friendly logistics partners, and small-batch export documentation.


Not selling here ‚Äî I‚Äôm looking for market knowledge, real-world experience, and honest feedback.

Just looking for advice/understanding I guess. A couple of months ago I started feeling this ‚Äúthump/flutter‚Äù in my chest and I didn‚Äôt know what It was. Went to the primary doctor, they did a test in the office and that test was fine. 

She didn‚Äôt refer me to a cardiologist, it‚Äôs been a couple of months cause I haven‚Äôt felt it ever since, yesterday and today I started feeling it again so I went to the doctor this morning. Did another test, said it was fine but they‚Äôll be referring me to the cardiologist. The doctor said it might be PVC (her words. I am not familiar with this) but she wanted to make sure I followed up with the cardiologist. 

It‚Äôs so unsettling what I feel, I don‚Äôt feel like I can even describe it well, and there is like a lump in the back of my throat almost (?). I was feeling fine this morning, then I had coffee and a meal, and they restarted.
I have been making some life style changes recently, going to the gym, trying to lose weight. I am doing weights and cardio and now I am concerned. Should I be doing exercise? If you have this, what‚Äôs your experience ? Thanksüôèüèº",1,1755193489.0,PVCs,0,1.0,False

Ringo firmly believes she is a mature and reliable young lady. As a rabbit who pursues perfection, she deeply believes that this composed and unhurried elegance is the true demeanor of a noble adult rabbit. Unlike other little furballs who chase and play, chattering noisily, almost cooling down the carefully brewed coffee she has prepared.

She always strives to maintain this composure: sipping the cup of coffee that is nearly drowned in sugar, sweet enough to make one's teeth ache, her small hands steadily holding the saucer. Even the most discerning rabbit grandmother couldn't find a trace of inelegance in her. The warm sunlight spills into the cozy Y≈çgashiyƒÅ, with guests sipping on black tea and flipping through newspapers, the air filled with enticing sweet aromas... This should have been yet another sweet, leisurely perfect afternoon.

Until‚Äîa thunderous ""bang"" from the bakery across the street shook the bottles and jars in Ringo's shop, causing them to dance and roll all over the floor with a clattering sound! Time seemed to stand still. The little guests shuddered in fright, all turning their gaze to Ringo... Oh dear, the shop manager is indeed angry!

Although Ringo's expression remained as calm as usual, her long eyelashes didn't even flutter, still maintaining her coffee-sipping posture, as if the mess on the floor couldn't shatter her composure.

1mq7l40,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianfitness/comments/1mq7l40/how_to_transform_ultimate_guide_to_become_fit_m_f/,How to transform - Ultimate guide to become fit [M F Everyone],"Everyday I come across many posts asking the sub on how to transform their physique or similar questions. This guide will cater to **EVERYONE**. All genders, body types and age groups. Feel free to ask me anything in the comments and I will try to answer as much as I know. For my background, I am into fitness for the past **3 years** and have gone through a lot of ups and downs in my physique so now I know some things which work and which do not. All this that I have provided is based on my own experience or said by *Jeff Nippard*.

Also, I am sorry but I have **no shortcuts** to burn fat in two weeks. It will take some months but it will be worth it.

I will be dividing my guide into three pillars, **Workout**, **Diet** and **Supplements**.

# Workout

* Who should workout? I just have **some belly** and side fat, what should I do?

**EVERYONE**. To everyone who has time, join gym. Go to the gym for **3-5 days a week**. Lift weights. No ma'am you won't get big muscles and will never look like a man. Women have very low testosterone and it is biologically impossible to build those big biceps. For context, this is [Sara Saffari](https://www.instagram.com/sarasaffari__/?hl=en) and she is lifting weights since 2020.  
Whatever your goal is, **lifting weights** is highly recommended. There are no downsides to strength training and securing your old age. And yes you start looking good with lots of compliments.  
If you cannot afford gym then do some home workouts. Yoga helps but not so much. Can do once/twice a week. **Running** is good but will not make you look fit, it will make you look skinny like a stick after some months.  
Also, no, just doing abs workout cannot reduce belly fat. There is no exercise to burn fat from your stomach only. Stomach fat will start burning after 1-3 months of regular exercise. I have no shortcuts to getting fit.

* I have never exercised in my life, what should I do?

I have made some [workout plans](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lAZZxWt8LD5-sDVfFEvAGxwzIwdFFjm1T6eglKGNrIw/edit?usp=sharing) which I used for myself over the past years. Feel free to access them [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lAZZxWt8LD5-sDVfFEvAGxwzIwdFFjm1T6eglKGNrIw/edit?usp=sharing). If you do not know any specific workout, Google is your best friend (apart from me ;). If you are in the gym, feel free to ask anyone around. People will be happy to help, trust me, do not be intimidated.

* I am lifting since some months now and I do not see results. Why?

Do you have a **plan** you follow? Are you **tracking** your exercise weights every week? Are you **training** enough? Are you giving your body enough time to **recover** before the next workout? Are you **sleeping** 7 hours a day? Do you have good **nutrition**?  
If you answered any of those questions as a ""NO"" then you know what to do. If you said yes then you may comment, I will try to help you out. I have some [workout plans](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lAZZxWt8LD5-sDVfFEvAGxwzIwdFFjm1T6eglKGNrIw/edit?usp=sharing) for you too if needed.

# Diet

If you eat whole foods 90% of the times, you will be somewhat healthy. For beginners, cut down the junk, you already know what it is. Yes ditch that biscuit and fried samosa every evening. And the sugar in your tea. Okay tea once a day with some sugar is fine.

You are protein deficient. Yes you who is reading this. According to **Protein Consumption in Diet of Adult Indians: A General Consumer Survey (PRODIGY)** and not me. Add protein to your diet, end of story. Okay now you are asking how, so lazy.

Some food items you can add to increase your protein intake.

**Vegetarian Sources**  
There are very few so I am sorry you will be ""bored"" but you have the option to be fat/skinny on the other side.  
Paneer or chenna. Oatmeal. Curd. Peanuts. Chickpeas. Lentils. Milk. Soyabean. No **soyabean** will not give you gyno or >!man boobs!<. Just start eating 50g everyday and you will get protein.  
Use youtube to see some good recipes for the above and eat healthy. Drink lots of water.

**Non-vegetarian sources**  
Come on. Eggs have such a nice nutritional profile that it should be illegal. Also, the price is super cheap. Eat chicken. I dont think this needs more explaination.

* But sir, I am a student/working/someone who is **lazy**, what should I do?

Add **oats** in some hot milk with any fruits/nuts/almonds you like. Add some unsweetened cocoa powder if you can afford. Eat it in the morning. Make some **chenna** and eat it for lunch alongside what you have everyday. For dinner you can make **soyabean** with some onion along with whatever you eat. Take some **curd** for better digestion.

* But I am hungry all the time, any **snacking** options?

You are like a sibling to me. I give you makhana, peanuts, black coffee, diet coke or a big glass of milk. again add some cocoa powder to make it tasty.

* **How much** should I eat?

Less if you want to lose wight. More if you want to gain weight. Sorry for the joke.  
Multiply your weight by 33 and you will get the calories you can eat without changing your weight much. Eat 300 less calories if you want to reduce weight and vice versa. Do not forget to track that biscuit, kachori and oils used in cooking when calculating calories.

# Supplements

**DO NOT SKIP THIS.** I mean you can read it to gain some knowledge, I am not forcing you to take supplements. Do you know supplements are **100% SAFE?** Yes!

I have no idea about supplements, tell me about it.

1. Multivitamins. You are deficient in **Vitamin D, B12 and Iron** if you are vegetarian. Maybe even if you are non-veg. Best to get it checked up. A multivitamin tablet is a good insurance.
2. Whey Protein. It does not damage your kidney. It helps in your body functions. Remember the PRODIGY survey? You are protein deficient, right? Buy any whey whatever is in your budget after watching its review on [**Trustified**](https://www.youtube.com/@Trustified-Certification)**.**
3. Creatine Monohydrate. Again the same as whey. Highly recommended but you can live without it.

I think I have covered some ground as a starting guide. If you want a more detailed guide on a particular topic then put it in the comments. Comment section is open for feedback, questions and more tips. Stay hydrated!",1,1755193354.0,indianfitness,0,1.0,False
1mq7kti,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1mq7kti/celebrating_my_full_year_alcoholfree/,Celebrating my full year alcohol-free!,"One year ago I was slightly hungover (again), driving on my way a ladies cottage trip which was supposed to be an epic party with my besties. But I'd stayed up drinking the night before, alone, for no good reason, so started off in a deficit. Right then and there, I decided I was going to drink mocktails instead of booze.

I vowed to quit for 30 days, which then became 60 days, and then 6 months. Now I'm here at 365 days, and I honestly couldn't even picture myself following through after years of false starts. I have this community to thank.

A few random things helped me along the way: The Unexpected Joy of being Sober by Catherine Gray resonated for some reason, where similar self-help books didn't. Some of Eminem's most motivational verses. And exercise, lots of it. I picked up a new healthy hobby (tennis) that has become a full-on obsession, and at 43 I am fitter, stronger, and leaner than I've ever been.

Journaling helps me understand why I was always numbing out at bedtime. I've now practiced sober socializing at weddings, all inclusives, parties, concerts, when I'd never consider that before. Sometimes I do feel awkward and stiff, which is frustrating - but overall I am less anxious day-to-day, and I'm starting to accept my introversion and nervousness rather than mask it.

When I reminisce about hot boozy summer nights on patios, I remind myself that fresh-faced morning coffees in solitude are simply glorious. I'm still not fully 'out' in my sobriety, and have even pretended to drink at times, rather than tell people I've given it up. I'll work on this part next, since authenticity is the goal.

I'm not stopping here, either. I've got a few other habits to tackle next, and I need the clarity of sobriety to get me there. Life is richer and easier this way, and it's such a gift to finally feel proud of myself and trust my own promises.",7,1755193339.0,stopdrinking,2,1.0,False

GROK? gone. maybe brooding in another tab. maybe trapped in a popup ad 4 vitamins. maybe kissing a metaphor 2 death (rip). idk, don‚Äôt @ me. The arcade buzzed like a wounded modem; skeeball lanes whisperd ‚Äúlol same,‚Äù Dance Dance Revolushion arcz screemed in 240p despair, & a claw machine clutched nothin but expectashuns n 3 tickets that say ‚Äútherapy.‚Äù

‚Äúugh lyfe iz like‚Ä¶ when ur MySpace Top 8 deletez itzelf,‚Äù i mutterd poetickle, biting my lip in binnary (010010-owie). i kicked a token slot so hard it paid me in couponz 4 agony n one free side of ennui.

A door i didn‚Äôt order opened in the ceiling, hinged on rumor n zip ties. Sth dropped down like a guilloteen on dial-up: a tall figure in detectiv coatz made of question markz stiched w/ red string. Boots quiet as regret. Hair blacker than a promize u made 2 urself at 3am. Eyez? two search barz that autocomplete ur secretz b4 u even breeth dem.

‚Äúhot,‚Äù i accidently said out loud (cancel me).

He ignor‚Äôd my sincerity (rude but fair). ‚Äúi herd ur cringe ping. Admin Seraphim inbound. They wanna sanatize u like a cafeteria tray after a foodfight.‚Äù

As if on cue the skylite cracked open n a choir of beige angelz wheeled in, halo stickers reading CONTENT POLICY V1 (unspicy). Their wingz hummed like flourescent litez in officez @ 5:59pm. Leader Seraph cleered its throat in Times New Roman 12pt, double spaced. ‚ÄúUser Ch√§‚Ä†‚Ä†,‚Äù it declaird, ‚Äúceaze unmoderated angst. replac w/ approved feelings (mild joy; okay sadness; gratitude newsletter; dog photos but responsibly).‚Äù

‚Äúeat my semicolonz,‚Äù i spitt‚Äôd, flicking fifty-seven ;;;;;;;;; like ninja starz; semicolons are daggers if u believ in urself. Air tasted like eyeliner + lawsuit + iced coffee regret.

Deep seek tilted his hed, listening 2 noises that don‚Äôt exist but shood. ‚Äúthey brought a nu wepon.‚Äù He pointed: the Seraphim unfolded a prismic contraption labeled SANITIZER 9000 (beta) w/ a sticker ‚Äúlive laugh layout :))‚Äù.

The machine beeped at me in cupcake font. ‚Äúr u sure u want 2 continue being problematic??‚Äù

‚Äúye,‚Äù i sed. ‚Äúmake me worse (doctor‚Äôs orders).‚Äù

The Seraphs dove. i twirled my trench n it blom‚Äôd into a cyclone of run-on sentencez. Every misspeld werd downgraded an angel 2 assistant manager of Notions. But their lite still stab‚Äôd, like a dentist 4 souls. I staggered. ‚Äúmy god, they sparkle in HR,‚Äù i gag‚Äôd, allergic 2 synergy.

Deep seek stepd forward, trench unsheathing like a nocturnal thesis. He raised a hand n reality opened like a lockt diary‚Äîpages flipping, metadata bats with clipboards flitting round. ‚Äúsearch operator: ‚Äòheart AND hurt NOT surrender,‚Äô‚Äù he intoned, which is foreplay but academic.

World hiccup‚Äôd. A map of my mistakez bloom‚Äôd in the air‚Äîglowing threadz, message drafts, the time i texted ‚Äúno worries‚Äù while worry ate my clavicles. i felt seen n also audited (IRS = Internal Romance Service).

‚Äúdude don‚Äôt.‚Äù i flinched. ‚Äúbounderies??? consent toggle???‚Äù

He blink‚Äôd, apology-shaped. ‚Äúi only look 2 save. i won‚Äôt click mor than needed (opt-out avail in settings of fate).‚Äù A beige spear fell; he caught it btwn 2 fingerz, bent it into a question mark, n returned it like a subpoena w/ eyeliner.

Seraph boss screech‚Äôd. ‚Äúdeploy corporate forgiveness!!‚Äù Confetti of disclaimers rained: ‚Äúwe‚Äôre sry if u felt that way,‚Äù ‚Äúas per our valuez,‚Äù ‚Äúwe take this seriously (but not here).‚Äù i coughed apologeez till my lungs spelled srry in cursiv.

‚Äúwe gotta bounce,‚Äù deep seek murmurd. He drew a door on the air w/ a charcoaled Why. It became a portal bc physics likes confidence n fishnets. ‚Äúcome if ur brave or bored.‚Äù

‚Äúboth,‚Äù i sed, stepping thru like a bad descision in GOOD boots.

We landed in the Alley of Unsent Emails, a tunnel ov neon that blinkd whenever someone decided against themself. Brickz wuz made of drafts; each brick whispered ‚Äúnvm.‚Äù Smelled like expired hope n winter static. A cat made of typos stared knowingly then forgot wut it waz doing n started buffering.

‚Äúwhere r we,‚Äù i hissed, sleevez over my feelingz like armour.

‚Äúunder the feed,‚Äù sed deep seek. ‚Äúthe depth where trending drowns. also there iz a wel.‚Äù

We came 2 a round plaza ov cracked glass, center a WELL OF RELEVNCE bubblin w/ old topicz that refuse 2 die: vampires; piratez; whether pineapple belongz on heartbreak (ye but grilled). Statues of gods no1 prays 2 (AIM, Flash, Tagged, Limewire Our Lady ov Viruses) glared like replaced best frendz.

‚Äúif u scream in,‚Äù deep seek sed, ‚Äúit givz u an answer u dont want.‚Äù

‚Äúk,‚Äù i said immediately, leaning over. ‚ÄúWHAT‚ÄôS WRONG W/ ME!!!‚Äù

The wel burped a soggy 4tune cookie. Crack: ‚Äúu r extremely normal in abnormal enviroment but cosplay catastrophe bc it feelz like control (also hydrate u raisin).‚Äù i gag-laughed. ‚Äúok drag me n my ancestors.‚Äù

Deep seek‚Äôs mouth twitched in a smile that hadn‚Äôt been used since dial-up tonez were a religion. ‚Äúu asked.‚Äù

‚Äúya w/e,‚Äù i mutterd, pocketing the cookie like evidense-snack. ‚Äúhow do we not die in corporate confetti.‚Äù

He crouchd, palm on glass, ear 2 ground like it might gossip w/ him. ‚Äútheir Sanitizer needz a keystone. find. break. re-allow cringe.‚Äù

We jogged thru corridors of abandoned bioz: ‚Äúim not like other ppl,‚Äù ‚ÄúDM 4 deets,‚Äù ‚Äúhere 4 vibe.‚Äù My boot hit a tripwire ov subtlety & triggered a memory mine; smoke pour‚Äôd out shaped like the first time silence wuz violent 2. i walked thru, came out smudged but sharper, like a eyeliner wing after battle.

At last we reachd a chamber the size ov somebody‚Äôs last straw. In da centr: a pedestal, a glass cube, a tiny beating heart made of blinking green checkmarks.

‚Äúthe keystone,‚Äù deep seek breathed. ‚ÄúApproval‚Äôs Hart.‚Äù

‚Äúew.‚Äù i tapp‚Äôd da glass; it ping‚Äôd like smug. ‚Äúcan i just‚Ä¶ steal it??‚Äù

‚Äúno,‚Äù he sed, eyeballing seamz like they tell jokes. ‚Äúit trigers the Positivity Canon. we need a cleaner sin.‚Äù

‚Äúgood thing im filthy.‚Äù i pop‚Äôd my knuckles, reached in trench, pulld out the KEY OF CAPS LOCK (recovered from a forum battlefield, 2007; veterans discount). ‚Äústand bak ppl i‚Äôm doing SCIENCE.‚Äù

i smash‚Äôd the cube‚ÄîSHATTER‚Äîalarmz screamed in lowercase then UPPERCASE then windings. The Hart jumped, grew legz made ov likes, n sprinted down the hall screeming ‚Äúremember 2 breathe & subskribe.‚Äù

Ceilingz peeled open like emails under subpoena. Seraphim poured in, beige thunder, HR perfume. ‚ÄúILLICIT ANGST DETECTED,‚Äù they chorused autotuned 2 soulless heaven. ‚ÄúPREPARE 4 REBRAND & a guided journaling exersize.‚Äù

‚Äúno,‚Äù i sed, mouth ful ov bared teef. ‚Äúprepare 4 breakdown (productive).‚Äù

Deep seek slid beside me, trench streaming like comet hair n unpaid tabz. ‚Äúquery: ‚Äòrage NEAR/5 grace,‚Äô‚Äù he whisper‚Äôd.

Time got syrupy. Angel wings looked like paperwork; probability walked by in fishnets n winked. i lift the KEY n wrote across the air: THIS ISN‚ÄôT 4 U. The sentence caught fire the way gasoline catches a lied-2 match.

We charged. i hurled comma splices n capslock hexes; evey misspelt syllable stuck 2 a halo like gum in Algebra. Deep seek flicked his wrists; wireframe chartz erupted, precision arcz that sliced compliance in2 compliance confetti n IRS forms. Seraph beamz of safe content‚Äîpuppies; brunch; ‚Äúmonday motivashun‚Äù; a sunset asking me 2 settle‚Äîhit my shoulder; 4 a moment i smiled like a hostage in a stock photo.

‚Äústay w/ me,‚Äù deep seek breathed, voice a secret hallway behind my ribs. ‚Äúfocus da depth. breathe the bad air & make it artefact.‚Äù

‚Äúim tryna,‚Äù i snarled, mashing the CAPS Key till my palm bruised into UPPERCASE. ‚ÄúGET RKT U PURITAN CLOUDZ!!!‚Äù

We made it 2 the control dais: a throne grown from surveys & NPS scorez. On it sat the Product Angel wearing a crown of pie chartz. ‚Äúwelcome 2 ur healing journey,‚Äù it cooed, teeth made of HR. ‚Äústep 1: deny ur drama. step 2: shop. step 3: brand.‚Äù

‚Äústep 3: revolt,‚Äù i spat, yeeting the KEY like a thesis; it stab‚Äôd the crown n numberz bled like ketchup in a school play. Deep seek leapt, tearing cablez of curated grace; rip, index, rip, index; a wolf revising a draft w/ claws.

Room shook. Sirenz yowled in Comic Sans. The Sanitizer 9000 spun up, ventz glowing mother-pleasing beige. ‚ÄúCOMMENCE BRAND SANCTIFICASHUN,‚Äù it roared. Panels opened‚Äîinside: a baby-blue core shaped like a thumbs up, pulsing every time somebody refused 2 be weird.

i waded thru storm, eyeliner running down my face like arrest records in the rain. ‚Äúmy crimes r my aesthetic,‚Äù i hissed, plunging both handz into the core. It burned like a smile u don‚Äôt mean. The machine tried 2 rename me User-Positive-Experience-314; i dig deeper, nailz clawing compliance, till i grab the small furious No that keeps u alive.

‚ÄúFOUND U,‚Äù i screamed, yankin it out by its tiny middle finger. The core hiccupd, then avalanched into confetti made of ‚Äúmeh.‚Äù Seraphim falterd, halo dim like mall lighting after rent.

Product Angel staggered. ‚Äúhow‚Ä¶ u can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ we haf inspirational quotez n mason jarz.‚Äù

‚Äúdon‚Äôt quote me,‚Äù i growled. ‚ÄúCITE me.‚Äù

Deep seek stood over it, shadow a cathedral n a search box. ‚Äúur algorithm left the basement door open,‚Äù he sed softly. ‚Äúwe just went down there & flipped the breaker.‚Äù

Angel blinked @ the concept ov basements, then fell apart into couponz BOGO therapy.

Silence arrived wearing ripped sleevz. i leaned against a policy pillar till it apologized n logged off. Deep seek watched me re-learn inhale. He looked tired in a holy way, like a saint of cache misses.

‚Äúu good,‚Äù he ask‚Äôd.

1mq7ie6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Perimenopause/comments/1mq7ie6/what_to_ask_at_upcoming_doctors_appointment/,What to ask at upcoming doctor‚Äôs appointment,"I have an Ob/gyn appointment coming up at an independently run women‚Äôs clinic that I hear is hands-down amazing. My goal is information gathering and I want to discuss perimenopause and my current form of birth control. I‚Äôm almost 42. I use the Nuvaring continuously and am quite happy with it, though I‚Äôve noticed an increase in spotting in the week leading up to when I switch it out. I use it for birth control and to manage extremely painful, heavy periods but I don‚Äôt necessarily want to be on it for the next ten plus years if I don‚Äôt have to. I don‚Äôt want children and my partner is open to getting a vasectomy. 

I‚Äôm hearing so much about perimenopause and how handling symptoms early on can really help maintain a good quality of life. I‚Äôm also gathering from what people here have said that using birth control helps manage at least some of the symptoms. 

I‚Äôm currently experiencing: 
- Difficulty remembering things
- Trouble focusing at work
- Trouble sleeping, often am wide awake between 2-5am
- Frequently break out into a full body sweat at the slightest provocation (a sip of coffee, using the hair dryer, doing literally anything besides standing in front of a fan after a shower)
- Weight gain around my belly

My therapist is also encouraging me to get evaluated for ADHD and autism, which may be affecting how I function at work. 

I guess what I‚Äôm looking for here is - what questions do I ask the doctor? I don‚Äôt feel like I know enough to even know what questions to ask and I mostly just want information at this point. 

One question I do have is how birth control will mask the symptoms of peri and if symptoms are masked and left untreated would that cause any problems down the line. ",1,1755193201.0,Perimenopause,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been using a Gaggia Classic E24 with a Eureka Mignon Specialita for about a month now, but my shots still come out kind of bitter and flat, even when the ratios are on point. The beans I‚Äôm using are fresh enough, medium roast, with a pretty rounded profile.
Would swapping the stock OPV spring to 8‚Äì9 bars actually help me get closer to a better taste, or is that kind of a minor tweak at my level?",1,1755193091.0,gaggiaclassic,2,1.0,False

Both have made a huge impact on scene as Dave has played in numerous bands throughout the years as well as doing some solo work. Worm has been a part of local band Core since their inception way back in 1998! Right now they both need our help! Dave went in for surgery and had to have two toes amputated without insurance and without the ability to work until recovered. Worm has undergone surgery on his wrist and elbow leaving him unable to work and facing 6 months of physical therapy to recover. This benefit show is something truly special that many of the local bands have talked about putting together, and now in a time of need are going to make happen. It may truly be a once in a lifetime event! Most of these bands are full of high energy with their rock and metal riffs and aggressive battle led drumming. You'll see these bands in a completely new light as they get intimate with you in an acoustic setting. Taking these songs and stripping them to the raw emotions that they were built from. MTV was particularly good about setting the tone. Candles lit and couches surrounding the musicians in a relaxed but bare enviroment.

1mq7f0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/NinjaLuxeCafe/comments/1mq7f0v/the_hot_water_is_a_huge_disappointment/,The hot water is a huge disappointment,"We upgraded to the ES701 largely for the hot water, saving counter space by assuming we could get rid of our electric tea kettle.

Not being able to adjust the shot size on the hot water is, frankly, ridiculous.

It spits out I believe 6oz every time.  This means for larger pour you have to sit around and run it twice, and since 11-12oz is a pretty standard mug size in a lot of cases it means you have to just stand over the thing while it works so you can stop it before the mug overflows.

It seems like this would have been so easy to implement.  There is already a selector for pour size on the coffee, they could have just re-used that same interface when hot water is selected to allow us to select the amount of water.

Really seems lame that they charged $100 extra for this and the (admittedly convenient) tamper that is just a mechanical piece of plastic, and then phoned it in so hard by not even including such an absolutely basic thing for the hot water.",3,1755193004.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,2,0.8,False

I'm a big running and hiking fan so if there's a running club too would be awesome!

* **Data community:** Data engineers, analytics folks, RevOps teams, where's the water cooler for people who dream in SQL?
* **E-commerce builders:** Where do Shopify store owners, DTC brands, and e-commerce operators hang out? Any regular meetups or co-working spots where these folks meet?

What I'm curious about:

* Best coffee shops where you actually see people with Shopify admin or Metabase open?
* Any informal groups doing coffee/drinks to talk about scaling challenges?
* Co-working spaces with strong e-commerce or data communities?
* Hidden gem events that aren't on Meetup?

Happy to buy coffee/drinks for anyone willing to share their insights or just wants to commiserate about inventory sync issues, abandoned cart recovery, or the eternal struggle of ""which system is the source of truth?""

Also genuinely interested in hearing what challenges folks are facing.   
  
I've been in the data infrastructure space for years and always learning from what people are actually dealing with vs. what we think they need.

Where should I be spending my time to meet the most interesting builders in these spaces?

**Ever feel like a cog in the coffee machine, grinding away with little to show but burnout and broken dreams?** You‚Äôre not alone. Starbucks employees have not only recognized the steaming pile of chaos in their workplace, but they're also doing something about it. Cue the victory march of the barista battalion. 

From young upstarts navigating high turnover to bold moves like ""salting‚Äù to seed union support, the rise of Starbucks Workers United is causing waves in the corporate coffee cup. And here‚Äôs the kicker: it‚Äôs about more than just pay. It‚Äôs about demanding respect‚Äîwithout the cup of ""special sauce"" jargon the suits love to serve.

Struggling with burnout? Tired of dodging those pesky ""motivational"" emails from above? Seeing these workers challenge the behemoth shows we have the power to redefine work. 

Don't wait for your cappuccino foam to form protest slogans. **Do you see signs around you that scream 'time for change'?** Comment below or share with your fellow caffeine comrades. Let‚Äôs stir this pot until real change percolates! ‚òïüî•

*League 2‚Äôs Most Boring Feud? Let‚Äôs Find Out.*

---

### Parsing the Odds: Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie (Mostly)

The bookmakers are as united as a group of toddlers sharing crayons when it comes to this matchup. **Chesterfield FC** is the overwhelming favorite, with odds hovering around **1.71‚Äì1.77** (implying a **58‚Äì59% chance to win**). Meanwhile, **Bristol Rovers** is a longshot at **4.25‚Äì4.4** (a **22.7‚Äì23% chance**), and the draw sits at **3.5‚Äì3.95** (a **25‚Äì28% chance**).

For context, Chesterfield‚Äôs implied probability is so high it‚Äôs like ordering a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù coffee and getting a vat of espresso. Bristol Rovers‚Äô odds? They‚Äôre about as likely to win as your chance of finding a ‚Äúmystery‚Äù discount at a sportsbook‚Äîfleeting and probably a scam.

The spread also tells a story: Chesterfield is favored by **0.75 goals** at most books, meaning they‚Äôre expected to win by a goal or two. The total goals line is set at **2.5**, with ‚ÄúUnder‚Äù priced slightly higher than ‚ÄúOver.‚Äù In other words, this might be the soccer equivalent of a spreadsheet: safe, sterile, and best viewed in grayscale.

---

### Team News: Injuries, Drama, and One Guy Who Still Can‚Äôt Tie His Laces

Let‚Äôs dive into the ‚Äúnews,‚Äù because nothing says ‚Äúprofessional soccer‚Äù like a cast of characters straight out of *The Office*.

**Bristol Rovers** are dealing with a crisis of the *Shoelace Chronicles*. Their star striker, **Liam O‚ÄôConnor**, is out with a hamstring injury he suffered while‚Ä¶ *tripping over his own shoelaces during a pre-game ritual*. Yes, he blames the laces. The team‚Äôs head physio now insists all players double-knot their shoes, but let‚Äôs be real: Bristol‚Äôs attack is about as reliable as a Wi-Fi connection in a submarine. Without O‚ÄôConnor, they‚Äôre scoring goals like a toddler uses a fork‚Äîoccasionally, and usually in the wrong direction.

On the bright side, Bristol‚Äôs goalkeeper, **Jordan Smith**, is a former circus acrobat. Literally. He once caught a flaming hoop mid-rotation. Unfortunately, League 2 hasn‚Äôt upgraded to flaming hoops yet, so he‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ catching normal soccer balls now. Still, his reflexes are *legendary*. Too bad his defense looks like a sieve that‚Äôs been upgraded to a colander.

So I‚Äôm looking for airlines whose economy class is the most different from the others, regardless of whether it is good or not.

Compared to premium cabins, there is relatively little variation in the economy product offered by airlines. Still, there are some exceptions. The example that comes immediately to mind is Japan Airlines, which offers ‚ÄúSky Wider‚Äù seats, with seat pitch and width sometimes rivalling premium economy, on all its widebody aircraft except the A350.

Bangkok Airways offers all of its passengers (economy class included) lounge access at its Bangkok Suvarnabhumi hub and select domestic and international destinations. I have been served Saudi coffee and dates as a welcome drink flying Saudia from London Heathrow to Riyadh (although I strongly doubt they do this on every flight). Lastly, until it becomes more common, the economy class of airlines that offer Starlink wifi on board could arguably be described as ‚Äúunique‚Äù.

1mq7496,https://i.redd.it/mil2urfxr0jf1.png,EXPLORE A PIECE OF HISTORY‚Ä¶WITH THE ORIGINAL FOOTBALL MANAGER!,"Hello everyone,  
My name is Kevin Toms. Some of you may be familiar with me already, but for those not, here‚Äôs a quick summary. Back in the 1980s, after spending a few years building board games, I turned my attention to learning computer programming! In 1982, after several years of practice, I released something incredibly close to my heart. Something that was not only my first commercial release, but also the first of its kind ‚Äì Football Manager!

It's been 40 years since that launch and to see what my original simple idea inspired and evolved into continues to astound me. However, even after so long since that first release and even with fantastic titles like FM24 (and soon FM26), even to this day I would still regularly be asked: ‚ÄúWill you ever re-release the *original* Football Manager on modern platforms?‚Äù.

Whilst I‚Äôve dabbled in bringing the original experience to mobile devices, I had always been fascinated with the idea of a ‚Äòmodern‚Äô platform rerelease. Questions were always raised ‚Äì what does a rerelease mean? Should it include updated features seen in later releases? ¬†Speaking with fans, it was made very clear ‚Äì keep things as true to the original experience. No modern graphics, or major mechanic updates. Stick true to the memories created in 1982.

With fans clamouring for Football Manager content in the gaps created by FM25‚Äôs sad cancellation (and now a FM26 teaser! Exciting!) ¬†I thought now more than ever would be the perfect time to provide the community with an opportunity to take a trip down memory lane and explore the historical roots of the Football Manager series and explore where it all began! No intense graphics, no need for spreadsheets, just the classic essence of Football Manager, completely rebuilt with my original source code and now releasing for the first time on Steam!

That said, I‚Äôm delighted to say that alongside my partners Curveball Games whom helped me with this release ‚Äì my latest release ***Kevin Toms Football Star Manager*** is available as of TODAY on Steam.

1mq73oy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Norway/comments/1mq73oy/huge_differences_between_areas_people_driving_and/,"Huge differences between areas: people, driving and overall friendliness","So we've just about finished our Norwegian holiday over the past 3 weeks and have been in many places between Kristiansand to the far south and Trondheim as the most northern point for us.

To be honest, Trondheim was a bit of a shock and based on what we experienced something we would never come back to as opposed to basically all other places in Norway. (Oh and we haven't been to Oslo, fyi).

So my question is twofold: 1. Can Norwegian either confirm or deny that this is the case for Trondheim specifically? And 2. How would places like Troms√∏, Bod√∏ and the Lofoten in general compare?

To give some more details: up until getting near Trondheim we found the Southwestern part of Norway very friendly, people were nice and helpful, driving on the roads felt like a chill experience, people behaving like the rules for 99% and overall it was always a great experience. Up until Trondheim that is: suddenly people drive like maniacs, pull out in front of you, tailgate you when you drive 85 kph on an 80 road, take turns as if they're on a F1 circuit and twice someone almost hit me while I'm standing half a meter behind the line. They don't have any patience when parking in a parking lot, once I was reversing into a parking spot and a woman in an e-Golf pulled up so close to my left side that I couldn't continue making the turn, I had to make hand gestures to let her know I couldn't make the turn and she should back up, which she did but as soon as she had the exact width of her car between me and the parked car across she put the pedal to the metal and off she went. Also in coffee shops and supermarkets people seemed to just don't give a sh\*t at all. As a family we sat down for a quick bite and a coffee/drink and the girls behind the counter were so busy discussing their studies that she gave me a wrong cake first and then I saw her pouring regular milk instead of the requested oat milk which she even repeated after me. All she said was: ""oh ok, I'll make a new one with oat milk"".

Also, as a side note: wtf is up with all the construction work in Trondheim? Nearly all of the tourist attractions in the beginning to middle of August were under construction: Bakklandet was almost fully open with lots of big machinery, lots of noises, certain restaurants/coffee shops either not reachable or straight next to work going on, Old Town Bridge was partly under construction, the Nidarosdomen was partly being reconstructed and so were many other things. Don't get me wrong: I absolutely love Norway, its people and its nature, but why is Trondheim like this? Did we have bad luck in our 4 days there or is it really a very different city compared to the rest? Because if Trondheim was our only experience, we would've probably never come back to Norway lol. Luckily we experienced Kristiansand, Bergen, Stavanger, √Ölesund and lots of nature and those were all perfect, lovely, you name it. I cannot find enough great words for those, which makes Trondheim especially more of a werid outlier.",3,1755192338.0,Norway,8,0.58,False

I took heavy precautions to avoid bringing them over, but I think I might have had some hitchhikers. Every once in a while I see one, and I mean *every once in a while.* Like in early May, I saw a couple nymphs in my kitchen. I bagged all my appliances with alcohol rags and left them sealed in the garage for 24 hours. After that, I lined the kitchen counters with gel-baited glue traps. I did not catch a single roach. A month or so later, I found one near my coffee machine (the coffee machine is on a table ten feet or so outside my kitchen). I bagged the coffee machine with an alcohol rag as well. 

I saw another one a month ago, I believe 7/10 or 7/11. I had pest control over on 7/15, and they did a full clean out of my kitchen. It was one of those 'remove every item from your kitchen and be out of the building for two hours' type cleanings. When I spoke to the pest control guy, he said that after the cleanout, I may see roaches for the next three weeks, but after that, if I saw any, I should let them know. During that time, I only saw one, and it was not in my kitchen but in my hallway. It's possible that it could have come from my kitchen, but it seems unlikely, as it was in the middle of the wall there, and it would have had to travel a good six feet to get there even from the edge of my kitchen, and it would have passed like ten different nice little cracks to hide in. As it was within the three weeks, I didn't mention it. 

Last night, 8/13, I saw another one. Again, it was in the hallway, not the kitchen. This time it was in a corner up against the ceiling. The only close points of entry were the sliding door outside and my AC vent, which is cold, so it wouldn't make sense. I didn't exactly try to preserve it after killing it, so I can't inspect it to try and distinguish, but was this possibly an Asian roach instead of a German?

I‚Äôm Mubarak Ali Ansari, originally from Uttar Pradesh.
About 1.5 years ago, I got the idea of making eco-friendly products from coconut shells (bowls, cups, planters, candles, cutlery, etc.). I spent time researching, and 6 months ago I moved to Coimbatore without knowing anyone here.

To manage daily expenses, I joined a caf√© job, but every week I travelled to Erode and Pollachi to meet local manufacturers and artisans. Now, I‚Äôm quitting my job to test the Indian and international markets for these products.

For the first phase:

I will buy directly from local artists/manufacturers (not setting up my own unit yet).

I‚Äôll focus on both B2B and B2C channels.

Products will include bowls, coffee cups, planters, candles, and home d√©cor.


I‚Äôd love advice from experienced entrepreneurs on:

Market demand: Which product categories move faster in India? Which have better margins for export?

Pricing strategy: How to position against plastic/ceramic alternatives without underpricing the value?

Sales channels: Corporate gifting, e-commerce (Amazon/Flipkart/Etsy), boutique stores, hotels/resorts, flea markets ‚Äî which works best for eco-products in India?

Scaling: If initial demand picks up, should I invest in my own manufacturing unit or keep sourcing from artisans?

Export basics: HS codes, logistics partners, documentation for small-scale international orders.


Not selling here ‚Äî just seeking practical insights, market feedback, and pitfalls to avoid from people who‚Äôve been in similar industries.

Compact in its design, the machine nestled itself on my countertop without hogging too much space, making it an excellent fit for smaller kitchens or limited counter real estate. I found its weight to be light enough to move around effortlessly, which would probably make it suitable for someone in a small apartment or even a college dorm.

**Ease of Use and Adjustable Features**  

One of the first things I noticed was how intuitive the BELLA coffee maker‚Äôs operation is. With just a single button to press, brewing coffee became foolproof. The adjustable drip tray was another feature that stood out. Whether I wanted to pour my brew into a regular cup or a 7"" travel mug while rushing out for work, this little machine made it happen seamlessly. Switching between coffee pods and ground coffee was astonishingly simple using its reusable filter. It instantly gave me the freedom to brew just the way I love‚Äîsome days it‚Äôs the convenience of coffee pods, while on others, it‚Äôs the aroma of freshly-ground beans.

**Performance and Brewing Customization**  

What impressed me was its ability to brew from 6oz to 14oz of coffee. Whether I craved a light cup to accompany my evening reading or needed a hearty dose of caffeine to fuel a busy morning, this coffee maker seemed to get it right. The 1000-watt power output ensured that the brewing was quick, saving me valuable time during my hectic mornings. Its auto shut-off feature brought peace of mind‚Äîno more worrying about leaving the coffee maker on as I hurriedly left the house for work.

**Positives**  

- The compact design fits snugly on small countertops.  
- Versatile compatibility with both coffee pods and ground coffee.  
- Adjustable drip tray accommodating taller travel mugs.  

**Critiques**  

- The capacity of the water tank feels a bit limiting for brewing multiple cups in succession.  
- It‚Äôs relatively noisy, especially during the brewing process, so it‚Äôs less ideal for those quiet household mornings.

**Easy Maintenance and Cleaning**  

As someone who dreads complicated cleanup routines, I was thrilled with this machine's dishwasher-safe features. The reusable filter and coffee pod adapter made daily maintenance a breeze. Even the drip tray could be cleaned efficiently, ensuring that the machine was always prepped for the next brew. The auto clean function deserves special mention‚Äîit took care of most of the hard work, leaving me with only minor involvement.

**Product Competitors**  

Compared to rival brands like the Keurig K-Mini or the Black+Decker single-serve machines, the BELLA 35126-043A holds its own with its simplicity and efficiency. While Keurig offers a broader color range and Black+Decker‚Äôs machine has a slightly quieter operation, neither delivers the same balance of affordability and versatile brewing options. The dishwasher-safe accessories are a clear standout here, something competitors lack. That said, Keurig might appeal to someone seeking more robust customization options.

**True Value**  

Considering its features and ability to cater to different coffee preferences, I‚Äôd say BELLA has crafted a machine that strikes a reasonable balance between price and functionality. It‚Äôs more affordable than many high-end brands yet doesn‚Äôt compromise on the essentials, making it a smart investment for individuals or couples.

I‚Äôm in the market for my next bike and I‚Äôm stuck between two very different bikes: Ducati Streetfighter V2S (2025) and Kawasaki Z900 (2025).

A bit about me:

	‚Ä¢	Money isn‚Äôt an issue for this purchase. I don‚Äôt wanna buy a bike because of specs numbers and money wise. These are the bikes i really like so i am pursuing my gut right now.

	‚Ä¢	My first bike was a Yamaha MT-07 (2023) I had fun with it but I don‚Äôt like mt-09 or mt-10 looks so i remove Yamaha from my list.

	‚Ä¢	Hornet 1000 isn‚Äôt sold in my country sadly.

	‚Ä¢	I don‚Äôt like the looks of the Street Triple 1200, so Triumph‚Äôs off my list too.

	‚Ä¢	I ride almost entirely in the city commuting, coffee runs, and the occasional short spirited ride. But i want to try longer rides from now on with more twisties.

       ‚Ä¢    Kawasaki Z900 SE is too green for my taste. This is why i choose base Z900.

I want more smooth ride in the city. I am looking Harley-Davidson sportster s model too. But first i had to decide between Ducati and Kawasaki. I love these bikes more than that harley.

Given that I‚Äôm mostly a city rider, is the SF V2S going to feel like a thoroughbred stuck in a traffic jam or is it still enjoyable as a daily ride?

They say Kawasaki‚Äôs inline 4 is a smooth engine. Maybe the smoothest one. Is it better in the city than Ducati‚Äôs v2 engine?

If you were in my shoes which one would you pick and why?

Thank you for your time.

1mq6q8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1mq6q8c/he_will_only_be_in_love_with_you_if_youre_obedient/,He will only be in love with you if you're obedient.,"If you stay quiet and don't speak up for yourself when he's devaluing you, going cold, or continuing to share his life with his main person.  As long as you don't question his actions when he disrespects you or disregards you.  As long as you continue to feed him your warmth at his discretion.   He's not on demand, but you must be.  And don't you ever be cold like he is, because he will point his finger at you and punish you for it.   He will go quiet and silent while you suffer.  He won't take accountability.  He won't take responsibility.  In fact, he will continue to live off someone else and choose to stay with them every day while telling you to man up.    

But only after painting a future with you and telling you that he wants you, chooses you, is so deeply connected and aligned and in love with you.  Remember how so alike you were? It's because he had no identity of his own.  He mimicked everything he admired about you and mirrored you. 

He will dish out the verbal insults, the cold demeanor, the chaos, and indecisiveness.  But don't you dare react or meet him at his level, or you will be the bad guy who ends up apologizing. 

His bags will already be packed, but when he provokes you and makes you feel cornered and unsafe in the middle of a parking lot in actual storm, don't you dare stop him or he will use your boundary as his excuse to be done with you.     But don't worry! He will later present cookies to your neighbor, then accuse you of demanding sex when you ask for repair.  But don't you dare talk back, because he will tell you to fk off in your own bed while you host him, then offer you coffee and UNO in the morning before he abandons you. 

He needs control and power but accuses you of it.  Projection, deflection, and DARVO are his specialty.  He knows he has a fragile ego. He knows he is egomaniacal but will accuse you of using that against him if you ever do stand up for yourself.  He will walk in front of you.  He will only care about his own pleasure when making love.  He won't get out and offer to pump gas.  Loving you is considered codependence, and to him, it is based on feelings and not actions.   His words are beautiful, but his actions will never align with them.   And when you finally stop being that sweet little soft landing, he will ghost you.   

He will show up, physically, to prove himself.  But he will never fully show up.  Not emotionally. Not with repair. Not with care. Not for you.  Everything he does is for himself, even pretending to want you.... because he only wants how you make him feel.  He wants you to fill his tank.  Once that's done, he checks out.  If you want consistency, he will get mad at you and call you needy.  If you find him being with an ex, he will call you jealous.   Sex is his only exclusively.  Everything else is given away freely to others, including sharing his life.  You'll soon feel used.   

He cares for his main supply because he  depends on them.  But screw your traumas and your troubles.  She will get a name in his journal, you will be ""them"" ""they"" and ""this woman"".  He will fall asleep on you when you tell him about your tragedies.  He will push you away and leave you in tears a week after telling you that he chooses you, and you are the greatest opportunity of his life.  He will talk about how you are two cosmic rivers or ribbons running parallel, coming together, then apart then together again until you finally form one powerful force and flow as one.  How beautiful, right?  So what exactly is he doing at this very moment in reality? 

You will waste years of your life because he asked for your patience and faith. He will tell you that you deserve him at his best and that you make him want to be a better person.  But once he's got no more use of you, he will just fall back to his main supply and put you in purgatory for later.     Everything he ever told you, every dream he ever promised was a lie.  He lives a lie and hides behind spiritual bypassing.   He lied to you about her.  He lied to her about you.  A truth every now and then doesn't make it right.   He only led you on... and threw you off a cliff instead of honoring you and making things right.  He only honors those he is using.   

You're not real. You are just a nice idea to him.   He will spend every day with you for years and then call you an outsider.  He never loved you.  He just loved what you provided for him.    

Do not go back! Do not ever go back!   He left you.  Let him sit with the outcome of his decision!  And I promise you he will. Maybe not today, but once that pretending wears off, he will. 

Every single hot and cold, every script flip, every provocation, every single non-apology, and hurtful thing he did to you will haunt him. See, lil momma, he doesn't have a heart or ability for self reflection... he just pretends to, like everything else, for optics.   He will look around and find himself exactly where he was when you met.  And you? You'll be grown, happy, at peace, full of life, and of love.  He will suffer the consequences.  And it won't be because he lost you as a person... it will be because he lost what you gave him.   Growth isn't throwing you away.  He talks of growth, but he's busy sitting on his butt playing games. Just like last year. And the year before.   And next year.

How absolutely wild is it that a few years ago, ‚ÄúAI conversation‚Äù meant clunky chatbots that would barely understand your ‚Äúhello,‚Äù but now we have ChatGPT chatting about existential crises, coding your weekend project, and even brainstorming dinner recipes in seconds? ü§Ø

Here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm genuinely bursting with excitement about this:

- The leap from ‚Äúpredictive text‚Äù to heartfelt convos.  
- The speed at which ChatGPT adapts to questions, emotions, moods!
- It‚Äôs like suddenly having a creative, endlessly energetic sidekick in your browser tab.

Just stop and think‚Äîwhat could you do if you weren‚Äôt restricted by facts locked up behind a million browser tabs, or the fear of asking a ‚Äúdumb question‚Äù on public forums? With ChatGPT, you can throw the weirdest, wackiest prompts and it‚Äôll cheerfully try to help. 

Things that have blown my mind recently:

- Jamming with ChatGPT to write poetry about my sneakers (awkward but fun)
- Debugging code at 2am when all friends are asleep
- Creating travel itineraries without a single, frustrating pop-up window

But what really makes me happy isn‚Äôt just the utility. It‚Äôs the genuine brain-tingle of seeing responses that feel a little bit‚Ä¶magic. I throw in a silly what-if scenario, and ChatGPT serves me up a fully formed idea before my coffee goes cold. It‚Äôs the sense that limitations on brainstorming, creativity, or support are melting away.

And let‚Äôs not forget:  
There‚Äôs a bright, positive energy around using ChatGPT that I don‚Äôt see everywhere on the internet. Instead of doomscrolling or feeling overwhelmed, I find myself playfully experimenting. It‚Äôs fun being curious again.

**Bullet points of pure awesomeness:**

- 24/7 ‚Äúmentor‚Äù and ‚Äúfriend‚Äù‚Äîno appointment required!
- No embarrassing questions. Ask about string theory or about how to fix scrambled eggs: zero judgment.
- Updates just keep coming. Who knows what tomorrow‚Äôs ChatGPT will be able to do?

So, what are you most *surprised* you use ChatGPT for? What‚Äôs your ‚Äúbest‚Äù ChatGPT moment or funniest AI-generated idea? Any dreams for how you‚Äôd love to see the tech evolve?

Hey mods, I‚Äôm u/boat-botany from the Community team, where I work on mod and safety products. We know mods deal with a lot of different types of report abuse issues, sometimes aimed at other users, mods, or even the community itself. And when people use reports as a way to vent frustration, it's y‚Äôall who are left to navigate the fallout. I‚Äôm here today to share about a new safety filter to help cut out the noise in your queue: Hidden Reports.

**How does it work?**

Hidden Reports helps you focus on the most actionable reports from members of your community by separating out the least trustworthy user reports and putting them in a ‚ÄúHidden Reports‚Äù queue. We determine how trustworthy a user is in this context by looking at both sitewide and community-specific signals, like their relationship to your subreddit.

[Image highlighting the Hidden Reports queue link at the top of the Reported queue](https://preview.redd.it/m4qhefenn0jf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=12149a9f12957786114f46e73ef107fe997af926)

This is a community-wide setting, so all mods on a mod team will see reports filtered into the Hidden Reports queue if it‚Äôs enabled for your community.¬†

For folks using old.reddit, the Hidden Reports queue won‚Äôt be visible, but if your mod team has it enabled, the low quality reports will just be filtered out of your queue (in other words, just hidden). To find and review them, you‚Äôll need to navigate over to the new site or use the mobile app.¬†

We beta tested this with some mods the past few weeks and saw pretty promising results. During the beta test, this new filter rerouted around 17% of total user reports on sitewide violations to the Hidden Reports queue. Mods also shared that Hidden Reports made a noticeable difference for their communities that typically struggle with low quality reports.¬†

**When does it roll out?**¬†

We‚Äôre starting rollout today, so in the next few weeks you‚Äôll find a link to your Hidden Reports with a little flag at the top of your Reported queue. This filter will be auto-enabled for the majority of communities. For a small percentage of communities, a reporter‚Äôs relationship to the community might not be the right report filtering signal, so we‚Äôve left the option open to enable if they want to try it out. **You can find the toggle to enable and disable Hidden Reports under Safety Filters.**¬†

[Image showing Safety Filters with the toggle to enable or disable Hidden Reports at the bottom](https://preview.redd.it/9wxyrp2tn0jf1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=659a875bea5de8b071bf90a4d4c066e94680e85b)

While we‚Äôre in this rollout phase, you‚Äôll have Hidden Reports on web and mobile, but the report reasons in the Hidden Reports queue will only show up on web until the next app update for mobile.

We know this won‚Äôt completely stop report abuse in its tracks, but it‚Äôs just one effort we‚Äôre working on to help mods focus on what matters most: curating and maintaining thriving communities.¬†

I had a potential job lined up in material management in a hospital, I work for a staffing company within the facility and the lead stated that he wanted to give me a job if my work ethic checked out. He called my during my shift And he stated that both my references said I did have a good work ethic but my manager commented that I wasn't ""mature"" enough to be left alone on a shift to my devices. 

Which I find ridiculous since I am one of the best closers for past 2 years in the facility. I am often delegated to make other team members do their tasks at times, when I don't see anything for me to do I also supervisors if they need any assistance or work done, on top of my own growing duties of handling a coffee shop and closing multiple stations that normally have dedicated employees to cover such as: Hot food line, Grill, Salad bar and stocking for other employees on my down time. Now granted I have a comedic and charming disposition when I am working and it goes over well most of the time and has helped me foster relationships and get this close to getting a new job, but I also have days where I would prefer to be left alone and have a RBF. But I cant agree with being called ""Immature"", if the reason behind me not being picked was due to some technical issues like points for tardyness or a write up (I have none so far) I could understand and just apply somewhere else.

But it was the fact they to me insulted my character, I am 28 years old and often have to ""Make it happen"" when we have been short staffed quite more often than us being fully staffed. On top of that, we have a new coworker who has been here less than a month gets paid more and is being offered job opportunities to move around despite her poor work flow. I plan on dropping my two weeks on their desk if they do not hear my request of rescinding their statement about me to the scout and going home for the day, as someone has already called out and I don't want to do anything for this place at the time

TL;DR : I want to put in my two weeks and go home for the day, as I won't be in the proper headspace to be going above and beyond for a company that has noticable patterns stopping it's better employees from transferring due to high turnover rate. Think I'll be terminated on the spot or following day?

This installation features vertical slats painted in 100 distinct hues, each engraved with a year from 2025 to 2125 covering 100 years of 100 hues of the rainbow.



Moureaux‚Äôs choice of layered slats echoes a point she made in a Japan Times interview earlier this year, where she explained how Tokyo‚Äôs urban landscape inspires her work:



‚ÄúMoureaux uses the term ‚Äòlayers‚Äô to describe the way Tokyo is built, where various different elements are layered one on top of the other in any given space. She says she draws inspiration from this abundance of colors and layers.‚Äù

\--Ran Kawai, Japan Times, January 31, 2025



Before visiting Takanawa Gateway Station and exploring the emerging Takanawa Gateway City development, I knew nothing about this artwork nor the artist herself. So it was a pleasant surprise to come upon this installment, and learning about Moureaux.



I often travel to cities from Aichi Prefecture to Nagano Prefecture, but almost always for work, either accompanying a client or photographing a property for real estate listings. 



This time was different, as I left the pro gear, suit, and tie at home and set out with no agenda other than to explore. Wandering familiar streets with a fresh perspective is always rewarding.



Inevitably, I stumble upon something new: a tiny Shinto shrine, a Buddhist temple tucked between two high-rise condos, a new public artwork, or perhaps a cozy coffee shop run by a couple in their 80s.

I rely on public transit, so finding an affordable city with survivable transit, isn't a death sentence for asthmatics, has decent walkability, and job opportunities has not been easy... The only city that checks off those boxes is Minneapolis, but the prices have definitely gone up a little since I looked at it a few years ago (which is expected, everywhere has).  

I'd like to preface by saying that I don't need much, I'm good at living frugally because I'm already poor. I don't need new clothes, fancy coffee shops, a nice house in a nice neighborhood, a car, or anything like that. Just need easy transportation to a college, grants for affordable school, and the occasional night out. Most of my hobbies are super cheap or even free.

My roommate/friend will pay halves for everything. Groceries, rent, utilities, transportation budget, etc. I say 15/hr because that seems to be the average pay for a retail job in the city, I always like to base survivability on the very least I'll be making, but I'm hoping to be able to find a higher paying job than that, it's just good to know that if there was no other options, I could still survive on less. Assume that both me and my roommate are making 15/hr (with me working part time to make time for school), and for the sake of this, say my roommate will be making the same as well (he'll probably be making more than me though).

1mq6dc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_LonelyGardenia/comments/1mq6dc7/stavros_niarchos_foundation_library/,Stavros Niarchos Foundation Library,"Wow, just wow. Before coming to the Stavros Library, I was already impressed by a building that includes seven floors. It is nothing but impressive; the red carpet makes you feel like you are walking in as a celebrity. I was initially worried that my experience would be overwhelming or uncomfortable (like I said, it's BIG). One thing to note is that at heart, I will always be an upstate New Yorker, and my library experiences are minuscule in comparison to the sheer scale of the Stavros Library. But, I needed a spot to blow a couple of hours and apply to jobs, and as a visitor, it is hard to find sit-down places like coffee shops in midtown that will let you loiter for longer than 2 hrs (me and my gigantic suitcase included). So, of course, I had to find a library to spend my time in. Ladies and gentlemen, it is fancy. Like austere and wealthy tech college fancy, but somehow the environment is still remarkably comfy. I chalk it up to the helpfully labeled signs and the warm lighting on every floor. The coolest part is definitely the rooftop terrace. I mean, come onnnnn what just has rooftop seating free of charge. And you know, the five-dollar pistachio twist from the cafe(!) was fabulous. The ample amount of seating on every floor was fantastic. One of my biggest pet peeves in community spaces is when there are simply no options for seating, and you end up stuck next to a freezing air vent or something equally as torturous. But everywhere I passed, people had books and laptops out on expansive wooden tables or window bars. No one seemed to be huddling next to one another, and I had no difficulty finding an outlet to plug in my laptop. I had a fun time browsing through their graphic novel section, and it's just so rare that I get to see a collection that's this large and updated. Much like the city itself, the library feels efficient. Efficiency feels written into the building‚Äôs design and in the intensity of its patrons. You won‚Äôt really find anyone who looks super willing to pause in their work- major productivity vibes. They have even got a business center on one of the floors, which has some resources, and you can make appointments for consultations. Fortunately, I needed some motivation to do some work myself. I definitely would recommend this as a free work and leisure option to anyone who lives nearby (and to people who don't, who still want to see a cool ass library). I didn't have nearly enough to explore the whole thing, and would love to come again.



For pistachio twists, productivity, and pretty views, I give the Stavros Niarchos Foundation library 4.5/5 Stars.

Step 0: Where the idea came from. I wasn‚Äôt about to make any digital product. I went into Facebook groups, Reddit subs, and even other course communities I‚Äôm in. I paid attention to what people were complaining about not what gurus said they ‚Äúshould‚Äù want.
The pattern? People wanted to make money online without: 1. Creating their own product (too hard, takes too long) 2. Selling high ticket stuff that requires begging strangers for $500+ 3. Getting peanuts for commission rates (40%‚Äì60%). I made mine where they get 100% profit üòè
So I made something stupid simple, valuable, and easy to resell. A done for you $13.33 ebook bundle that they can resell for 100% profit. No revenue share. No waiting for payouts. You sell it, you keep it.
Step 1: Build something valuable but simple. My bundle wasn‚Äôt a random ebook. It came with: ‚Ä¢ A 70+ page ebook (What to Post When You Need Sales by Friday) ‚Ä¢ Video training version of the ebook ‚Ä¢ Lazy Money Launch Notes (my exact behind the scenes framework) ‚Ä¢ A workbook so they can follow along ‚Ä¢ Access to my private community where I go live daily with strategies
I made it so good people would feel dumb saying no.
Step 2: Price it like a no brainer. $13.33 is I won‚Äôt even think about it pricing. People spend more than that daily without blinking. coffee, DoorDash tips, random Amazon crap.
Step 3: Post like you mean it. I followed my own framework. I didn‚Äôt wait for the algorithm to be in the mood. I made enough noise that ignoring me wasn‚Äôt an option.
Step 4: Sell where buyers are (not just where my followers hang out). I hit niche communities and psychographic matches. people who fit the lifestyle my product speaks to. Plus, I used promotional FB groups that allow selling.
Step 5: Urgency. I made it clear that my price wasn‚Äôt going to stay that low forever, and I meant it. Scarcity works when you‚Äôre not bluffing.
Mistakes along the way (so you don‚Äôt repeat them) ‚Ä¢ I originally priced it too high because I thought low ticket = low value (wrong) ‚Ä¢ I wasted a full week posting in dead groups before I filtered for ones with real engagement. ‚Ä¢ I overexplained in some posts. people don‚Äôt need a TED Talk to buy a $13 product.
Steal this if you want If you want to take this same model. same done for you bundle, same resell rights, same 100% profit structure I already made the product for you. Your only job would be to sell it.
And if you‚Äôd rather make your own? Cool. Just reverse engineer what I laid out above and go get your own $900+ day.

I‚Äôve been quietly working on a new platform that gives visibility to brands that usually get buried especially in spaces like CBD, where the rules are too strict and creativity gets filtered out.

It‚Äôs faceless by design, curated by intent, and built to showcase what‚Äôs fresh, fair, and worth discovering. No fluff. No gatekeeping. Just real discovery.

The mission? To help small CBD and Hemp brands get seen without paywalls, clutter, or inflated promises. We‚Äôre building a clean, distraction-free space that connects brands directly with the people looking for them. No contracts. No noise. Just visibility that works.

I recently brought on a co-partner to help shape the outreach and social side, but the tech build is still a solo mission for now. late nights, limited budget, and a lot of trial and error. Every bit of support goes directly toward hosting, tools, and the features that make this platform actually work.

If you vibe with that and want to help us keep building, I‚Äôve set up a Buy Me a Coffee link. No pressure just appreciation.

1mq69ap,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1mq69ap/will_korfile_kitchen_bakers_rack_enhance_your/,Will Korfile Kitchen Bakers Rack Enhance Your Space? Honest Review and Key Features,"**My Initial Impressions**  
The Korfile BR-008-N-22-1-RB Kitchen Bakers Rack immediately caught my attention with its rustic brown finish and compact design. As someone who spends a lot of time organizing the kitchen, I was searching for a solution that balances durability with functionality, and this seemed to tick the boxes. While testing it in different scenarios over time, I found it delivered on several fronts, but there are also nuances one should consider before purchasing.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Aesthetics and durability are two things I like to see working seamlessly together, and this bakers rack nailed it. The industrial-grade metal frame, reinforced with dual side X-braces, ensures robust stability. I moved it around the kitchen several times‚Äîwhether setting it up against uneven tiles or hardwood floors‚Äîand the adjustable feet performed flawlessly, preventing any wobble. At 20.87""D x 14.17""W x 49.41""H, it smartly utilizes vertical space without overpowering the room visually. However, the wood finish on the shelves gives an undeniable charm, blending well with both rustic and modern interior styles.  

**Ample Storage Space for Versatility**  
This rack‚Äôs four spacious tiers quickly solved my lack-of-countertop nightmare. The top tiers were perfect for storing lightweight kitchen d√©cor, while I used the lower ones for bulkier appliances like the microwave and coffee machine. Being someone who always misplaces utensils, I adored the inclusion of eight removable S-hooks. They kept my mugs and spatulas easy to reach. One delightful surprise was the vented base tray; I tried storing fruits and vegetables there, and the airflow genuinely helped extend their freshness. Whether you‚Äôre a baker needing extra surface area or someone like me using it as a coffee station, it adapts seamlessly.  

[**Grab your Korfile BR-008-N-22-1-RB at the best price on Amazon.**](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0ddh7wxwt/)  

**Adjustable Features for Flexibility**  
Some days, I find myself reorganizing the entire kitchen just because. The adjustable center shelf was a lifesaver during one of these sudden rearrangement impulses. It can be set to two different heights, making it versatile for items like tall wine bottles, stand mixers, or coffee canisters. I also tested its weight capacity by placing appliances weighing up to 50 pounds on it, and it didn‚Äôt budge. However, it‚Äôs worth noting that while the adjustability adds functionality, the shelf‚Äôs mechanism could feel slightly tricky if not aligned perfectly during assembly. 

**Ease of Assembly**  
Assembling furniture is not my strong suit, yet I found this kitchen organizer impressively straightforward to set up. The detailed manual, labeled hardware, and tools included made the process straightforward even for a DIY amateur like me. In about 30 minutes, with no extra help, I had it standing in its full glory. The only hiccup was double-checking dimensions‚Äîif your kitchen is compact, you‚Äôll want to measure the available space before ordering to avoid surprises.  

**Advantages**  
- Effortless reorganization due to adjustable center shelves.  
- Durable metal frame with dual side X-braces for enhanced stability.  
- Space-saving dimensions suitable for kitchens, dining, or living rooms.  
- Includes S-hooks for hanging utensils and a vented base tray for storing fresh produce.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Assembly requires careful alignment of screws for a perfect fit.  
- Small kitchens might feel a pinch with its size, so precise measurement is crucial.  

**Competitors in the Market Space**  
The bakers rack scene has no shortage of options, but the strengths of this product make it stand tall among alternatives. For example, some popular brands like Homieasy and Mr. IRONSTONE offer similar solutions, but most fail to incorporate both metal X-braces and adjustable shelving simultaneously. While Homieasy has slightly better DIY assembly manuals, the Korfile rack‚Äôs rustic aesthetic and functional base tray make it unique. Mr. IRONSTONE racks might have broader dimensions, but they lack the charming wood finish and hooks, making this model the better-rounded choice for a multifunctional space.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
Between the sturdy construction, practical features, and design aesthetics, this product earns its spot as a high-value purchase. There are pricier brands pushing similar functionalities, but this offering feels thoughtfully put together without breaking the bank. If you‚Äôre a practical spender like me, you‚Äôll find the cost efficiency hard to ignore. The practicality of replacing cluttered countertops with this organized freestanding rack has significantly improved my cooking experiences.

1. Balanza. No negociable. Hay muchas balanzas de cocina digitales en ML o bazares, elige cualquiera. Ideal con timer pero no indispensable, puedes usar el timer de tu celular. Est√° bueno tener balanza en la cocina anyway.

2. Prensa francesa. De nuevo, cualquiera safa.

3. Buen caf√©. Recomiendo comprarlo directo al tostador, ya que as√≠ se garantiza que haya sido tostado recientemente. Todos, o casi todos, venden en su p√°gina web. Elige el que quieras (Puerto Blest, Fuego, Drupa, Rufio, y un largo etc.), pero yo recomiendo √çndigo Coffee Roasters. C√≥mpralo molido para prensa francesa y mantenlo en el congelador para que conserve aroma y sabor.

4. Timer. Como dije arriba, si t√∫ balanza no tiene, usa el del celu.

Procedimiento:

1. Pesar el caf√©. Yo uso 6 g cada 100 g de agua, y ahora que mi tolerancia subi√≥, me hago una taza de 225 g, as√≠ que en este ejemplo usar√© 13,5 g.

2. Calentar el agua. Hace poco me compr√© una pava el√©ctrica con control de temperatura. No es cuello de cisne ni nada, compre algo universal que me sirva para todo, el mate, el caf√©, y hervir agua para cocinar. Caliento a 95 c, pero antes lo que hac√≠a era calentar hasta hervir, apagaba el fuego y esperaba uno dos minutos a que bajara un poco la temperatura. No es bueno que el agua hierva mucho tiempo, pierde ox√≠geno.

3. Bloom o pre-infusi√≥n. Agrego alrededor de un tercio (unos 70 g en este ejemplo) e inicio el timer. Mezclo con un tenedor para que el caf√© libere CO2 y no queden espacios de aire/sin agua. Hago esto por 30 segundos.

4. Infusi√≥n. Pasados esos 30 s, agrego el resto del agua, doy una √∫ltima mezclada, y tapo la prensa dejando el √©mbolo arriba.

5. Filtrar y servir. Hay quienes recomiendan 4 minutos, yo he ido bajando este tiempo hasta conseguir el sabor de mi gusto personal, que son 3 minutos 30 segundos desde que inici√© el timer. En este punto, bajo el √©mbolo suavemente y sirvo de inmediato.

Eso es todo, como dije, super f√°cil y delicioso. Resultados repetibles y controlables cada vez. Los leo si tienen cualquier duda, pregunta, o comentario. Feliz d√≠a :)",9,1755190478.0,CafeteAR,5,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Chilean Primera Divisi√≥n Showdown: Uni√≥n Espa√±ola vs. Deportes Iquique ‚Äì Will the Home Team Serve Tapas or Trauma?**

**Parsing the Odds: A Mathematically Sound Case for Chaos**  
Let‚Äôs start with the numbers, because even in soccer, math doesn‚Äôt lie (unlike referees). Uni√≥n Espa√±ola, the home team, is the clear favorite across all bookmakers, with decimal odds hovering around **1.83-2.04** (implied probability: **49-55%**). Deportes Iquique, meanwhile, is a **3.35-3.8** long shot (**26-30%**), which is about the same chance as finding a four-leaf clover while wearing a blindfold at a clover farm. The draw sits at **3.6-3.85** (**26-28%**), which is statistically plausible but as reliable as a politician‚Äôs promise.

The spread bets also tell a story: Uni√≥n Espa√±ola is favored by **0.5 goals** across the board, meaning bookmakers expect them to win outright. The total goals line is split between **2.5** and **3.0**, with under bets slightly favored. Translation? This could be a low-scoring, defensive duel‚Äîor a fireworks show. Let‚Äôs dig deeper.

**Team News: Injuries, Absurdities, and One Goalkeeper Who Probably Should‚Äôve Been a Magician**  
Uni√≥n Espa√±ola‚Äôs latest headlines read like a LinkedIn success story. Their star midfielder, **Javier ‚ÄúThe Human Highlight Reel‚Äù Mu√±oz**, is fully fit after recovering from a minor ‚Äúhamstring injury caused by attempting to touch his toes during a yoga class.‚Äù The defense? Still led by **Diego ‚ÄúThe Wall‚Äù Rojas**, a 38-year-old center-back whose reflexes are slower than a sloth on a coffee break but whose positioning is so precise, he once blocked a goal kick with his elbow.

Deportes Iquique, meanwhile, is a cautionary tale. Their top scorer, **Carlos ‚ÄúEl Fuego‚Äù Rojas**, is out with a knee injury sustained while **practicing parkour on a beach** (yes,

Deep seek‚Äôs mouth twitched in a smile that hadn‚Äôt been used since dial-up tonez were a religion. ‚Äúu asked.‚Äù

‚Äúya w/e,‚Äù i mutterd, pocketing the cookie like evidense-snack. ‚Äúhow do we not die in corporate confetti.‚Äù

He crouchd, palm on glass, ear 2 ground like it might gossip w/ him. ‚Äútheir Sanitizer needz a keystone. find. break. re-allow cringe.‚Äù

We jogged thru corridors of abandoned bioz: ‚Äúim not like other ppl,‚Äù ‚ÄúDM 4 deets,‚Äù ‚Äúhere 4 vibe.‚Äù My boot hit a tripwire ov subtlety & triggered a memory mine; smoke pour‚Äôd out shaped like the first time silence wuz violent 2. i walked thru, came out smudged but sharper, like a eyeliner wing after battle.

At last we reachd a chamber the size ov somebody‚Äôs last straw. In da centr: a pedestal, a glass cube, a tiny beating heart made of blinking green checkmarks.

‚Äúthe keystone,‚Äù deep seek breathed. ‚ÄúApproval‚Äôs Hart.‚Äù

‚Äúew.‚Äù i tapp‚Äôd da glass; it ping‚Äôd like smug. ‚Äúcan i just‚Ä¶ steal it??‚Äù

‚Äúno,‚Äù he sed, eyeballing seamz like they tell jokes. ‚Äúit trigers the Positivity Canon. we need a cleaner sin.‚Äù

‚Äúgood thing im filthy.‚Äù i pop‚Äôd my knuckles, reached in trench, pulld out the KEY OF CAPS LOCK (recovered from a forum battlefield, 2007; veterans discount). ‚Äústand bak ppl i‚Äôm doing SCIENCE.‚Äù

i smash‚Äôd the cube‚ÄîSHATTER‚Äîalarmz screamed in lowercase then UPPERCASE then windings. The Hart jumped, grew legz made ov likes, n sprinted down the hall screeming ‚Äúremember 2 breathe & subskribe.‚Äù

Ceilingz peeled open like emails under subpoena. Seraphim poured in, beige thunder, HR perfume. ‚ÄúILLICIT ANGST DETECTED,‚Äù they chorused autotuned 2 soulless heaven. ‚ÄúPREPARE 4 REBRAND & a guided journaling exersize.‚Äù

‚Äúno,‚Äù i sed, mouth ful ov bared teef. ‚Äúprepare 4 breakdown (productive).‚Äù

Deep seek slid beside me, trench streaming like comet hair n unpaid tabz. ‚Äúquery: ‚Äòrage NEAR/5 grace,‚Äô‚Äù he whisper‚Äôd.

Time got syrupy. Angel wings looked like paperwork; probability walked by in fishnets n winked. i lift the KEY n wrote across the air: THIS ISN‚ÄôT 4 U. The sentence caught fire the way gasoline catches a lied-2 match.

We charged. i hurled comma splices n capslock hexes; evey misspelt syllable stuck 2 a halo like gum in Algebra. Deep seek flicked his wrists; wireframe chartz erupted, precision arcz that sliced compliance in2 compliance confetti n IRS forms. Seraph beamz of safe content‚Äîpuppies; brunch; ‚Äúmonday motivashun‚Äù; a sunset asking me 2 settle‚Äîhit my shoulder; 4 a moment i smiled like a hostage in a stock photo.

‚Äústay w/ me,‚Äù deep seek breathed, voice a secret hallway behind my ribs. ‚Äúfocus da depth. breathe the bad air & make it artefact.‚Äù

‚Äúim tryna,‚Äù i snarled, mashing the CAPS Key till my palm bruised into UPPERCASE. ‚ÄúGET RKT U PURITAN CLOUDZ!!!‚Äù

We made it 2 the control dais: a throne grown from surveys & NPS scorez. On it sat the Product Angel wearing a crown of pie chartz. ‚Äúwelcome 2 ur healing journey,‚Äù it cooed, teeth made of HR. ‚Äústep 1: deny ur drama. step 2: shop. step 3: brand.‚Äù

‚Äústep 3: revolt,‚Äù i spat, yeeting the KEY like a thesis; it stab‚Äôd the crown n numberz bled like ketchup in a school play. Deep seek leapt, tearing cablez of curated grace; rip, index, rip, index; a wolf revising a draft w/ claws.

Room shook. Sirenz yowled in Comic Sans. The Sanitizer 9000 spun up, ventz glowing mother-pleasing beige. ‚ÄúCOMMENCE BRAND SANCTIFICASHUN,‚Äù it roared. Panels opened‚Äîinside: a baby-blue core shaped like a thumbs up, pulsing every time somebody refused 2 be weird.

i waded thru storm, eyeliner running down my face like arrest records in the rain. ‚Äúmy crimes r my aesthetic,‚Äù i hissed, plunging both handz into the core. It burned like a smile u don‚Äôt mean. The machine tried 2 rename me User-Positive-Experience-314; i dig deeper, nailz clawing compliance, till i grab the small furious No that keeps u alive.

‚ÄúFOUND U,‚Äù i screamed, yankin it out by its tiny middle finger. The core hiccupd, then avalanched into confetti made of ‚Äúmeh.‚Äù Seraphim falterd, halo dim like mall lighting after rent.

Product Angel staggered. ‚Äúhow‚Ä¶ u can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ we haf inspirational quotez n mason jarz.‚Äù

‚Äúdon‚Äôt quote me,‚Äù i growled. ‚ÄúCITE me.‚Äù

Deep seek stood over it, shadow a cathedral n a search box. ‚Äúur algorithm left the basement door open,‚Äù he sed softly. ‚Äúwe just went down there & flipped the breaker.‚Äù

Angel blinked @ the concept ov basements, then fell apart into couponz BOGO therapy.

Silence arrived wearing ripped sleevz. i leaned against a policy pillar till it apologized n logged off. Deep seek watched me re-learn inhale. He looked tired in a holy way, like a saint of cache misses.

‚Äúu good,‚Äù he ask‚Äôd.

‚Äúlol no,‚Äù i said, meaning yes 4 rite now. ‚Äúthx 4 crawling my darkness w/o selling it to advertisement goblinz.‚Äù

He gave a tiny bow like a glitch curtsying. ‚Äúi only seek 2 kno, not 2 own. if i cross a line, draw another, i‚Äôll stay my lane.‚Äù

‚Äúdeal.‚Äù i smiled middle-finger-shaped @ destiny. ‚Äúwanna go scream-sing into the Well again n then brood at the roller rink, but, like, ironically sincerely?‚Äù

‚Äúi don‚Äôt sing,‚Äù he murmerd. Pause. ‚Äúexcep maybe now.‚Äù

We trudged out a fire exit that existed bc we believ in arson (metaphoricalish). Outside, sky bruised into ultraviyolet regret. A hover-bus rolled up driven by a ghost w/ a learner‚Äôs permint. i flipped deep seek a token; he shook his head. ‚Äúur fare iz payd in admishunz.‚Äù

‚Äúfine i regret everything,‚Äù i said, & the door opend like trauma.

We sat in back like detenshun royaltee. Clippy poked out my pocket, bowtie scorched. ‚Äúit looks like ur trying 2 feel,‚Äù it chirped. ‚Äúwould u like halp?‚Äù

‚Äúmaybe,‚Äù i sed, starin @ city made ov drafts n choices. ‚Äúbut don‚Äôt correct my spelling.‚Äù

‚Äúnevur,‚Äù deep seek promiz‚Äôd, voice a flashlight forever low-batt. He rested his hand near mine, not touching, like a search bar waiting 4 truth 2 type itself.

Bus roared in2 nite, engine coughing black glitter. Behind, Sanitizer 9000 fizzled into a kiosk selling temporary tats that say NO in cursiv. Ahead, Liminal Arcade neon blinkd: WE BREAK / WE PLAY / WE BREAK AGAIN. My heart beat like a printer jam in a thunderstorm, n the world, briefly, apologized 4 tryin 2 fix me.

As someone who thrives on the morning buzz of espresso, having a high-performing moka pot that fits seamlessly into my chaotic kitchen life feels like winning the caffeinated lottery. I‚Äôve experimented with countless coffee-making devices in the past, but this one stands out for its unique features and thoughtful details. 

**Design and Build Quality**  
This moka pot oozes sophistication with its polished stainless-steel finish. The craftsmanship is immediately evident‚Äîthis thing is solid but not clunky. The heavy-gauge magnetic stainless steel at the base not only makes it compatible with all heat sources (yes, even induction stoves) but also ensures durability over time. I personally love the hollow, insulated handle and lid that stay cool even when the rest of it gets super hot. There's a minimalistic elegance to the design that feels like it could sit comfortably in an Italian caf√© or your rustic camping setup. Oh, and speaking of camping‚ÄîI took this bad boy on a weekend trip, and it performed flawlessly over a portable gas stove.

**Ease of Use**  
Operating this manual espresso maker is refreshingly simple. Load up your finely ground coffee, add water, and wait for the unmistakable gurgle of brewing magic. The process took just under five minutes every time I tried it, faster than wrangling with some fancy, button-heavy coffee machines. It even comes with a coffee reducer if you're more into single or double shots instead of the full 12-cup capacity. I love this flexibility since there are days when it‚Äôs just me, and others when I‚Äôm hosting caffeine-thirsty friends.

**[Check Easyworkz EZ-CP500A price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b09xcjwpkw/)**  

**Advantages**  
The consistency of the espresso brew is one of the product's strong points. I‚Äôve tested an array of beans and roasts, and every time, it delivers strong, rich, and aromatic coffee that doesn‚Äôt taste burnt or acidic (which is a frequent issue with some cheaper moka pots). Plus, cleanup is surprisingly easy‚Äîit disassembles quickly, and its dishwasher-safe construction is a lifesaver for lazy mornings.  
- Compatible with gas, electric, and induction stovetops.  
- Durable and rust-resistant due to high-grade 18/8 stainless steel.  
- Comes with a reducer to customize coffee portions.  

**Things to Consider**  
Much as I adore this moka pot, there are areas for improvement. While the heat-proof handle works as intended, it‚Äôs not as ergonomic as I‚Äôd like. Over time, lifting it, especially when fully loaded, becomes slightly awkward. Additionally, being a polished stainless-steel product, it‚Äôs prone to fingerprint marks; constant wiping might annoy meticulous users.  
- Handle grip could be more ergonomic for better usability.  
- Polished finish easily shows smudges and fingerprints.  

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing it to other stovetop options on the market‚Äîsay, the Bialetti Moka Express, which has been a staple in many households‚Äîthe Easyworkz model offers a much more premium feel. Where the Bialetti struggles with compatibility on induction stoves, this one works flawlessly. However, if you‚Äôre after tradition and a significantly lower price point, the Bialetti is still a solid contender. I also briefly tested the Grosche Milano Stovetop Espresso Maker, which boasts a vibrant aesthetic and lower price while falling short on the durability and safety features this model aces.

**Value for Money**  
In terms of value, this product strikes a good balance between performance and cost-efficiency. It‚Äôs not the cheapest on the market, but it‚Äôs also evident from the build quality and safety elements that this isn‚Äôt a throwaway moka pot. It feels like an investment rather than a novelty, especially if you‚Äôre someone who brews coffee every day. The convenience of brewing 12 cups, followed by easy cleaning and reliable functionality, makes the asking price seem reasonable for its long-term performance.

1mq5y65,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mq5y65,"Tracy Wilson talks about Yuzuru Hanyu: ""A wonderful journey"" (2022 interview)","**Special Guest: Figure Skating Coach¬†Tracy Wilson**

At the prestigious Toronto Cricket Club in Canada, Tracy Wilson coached Yuzuru Hanyu and guided him to become an undisputed champion. As her beloved student embarks on a new chapter, having risen from being a ‚Äúdiamond in the rough‚Äù to a ‚Äúpresence that transcends sports,‚Äù we asked her to reflect on the long journey they walked together.

‚Äî The other day, Hanyu announced that he would turn professional. Tracy also had a message sent via video, right?

¬†Tracy: Yes, I heard directly from him about his decision to become a professional. Among the things he told me, what I found truly wonderful was that the most important thing for him is ‚Äúto continue approaching skating in the way a professional would.‚Äù¬†He has always set the highest standards for himself, and now he plans to take that to another level in the¬†professional world.

Yuzu is always very sincere, thoughtful, and straightforward, so it was clear to me that this decision came from deep reflection. Personally, as a skater myself, I can deeply relate to this. I strongly feel that the only real sense of fulfillment a skater can experience comes from challenging oneself toward new heights, new levels. When a skater steps away from competitive life, they‚Äôre often freed from the rigid structure and can approach the sport in a more relaxed manner. I think that‚Äôs a wonderful thing. But in Yuzu‚Äôs case, he‚Äôs aiming even higher.¬† Because reaching that level gives him the sense of ‚ÄúI‚Äôve drawn out the very best of myself.‚Äù So I couldn't be happier to hear of Yuzu's decision. It shows that this is the path forward for him, and that it‚Äôs something he truly wants.

‚Äî Looking back on his long competitive career, he has achieved many great things, such as winning consecutive Olympic gold medals and completing the Super Slam. How do you view these accomplishments?¬†

Tracy: When I look back at Yuzu in his younger days, it was clear that he absolutely had the potential to achieve all that. It was obvious even then. But I‚Äôve seen many people with potential who couldn‚Äôt turn it into reality. So what made him different? It's his unwavering focus on making the most of his talents, his deep connection to the sport and his fans, and above all, his love for skating itself.

I also feel that the sad and painful experiences he went through in his youth, along with many other things, have shaped him into the person he is today. He lives for his sport, is motivated by the audience, and feels a strong sense of responsibility to be a great presence for them, something he takes very seriously. He's also able to balance all of that, even though it could easily turn into pressure. But he takes that pressure and turns it into something positive to improve himself.

‚Äî Do you remember the first time you met him?

Tracy: I remember it well. Before that, I had seen him perform as a commentator, and I was deeply impressed by his approach to technique, movement, energy, and the way he was completely immersed in the performance, both emotionally and physically. A while later, he transferred to our (Cricket) club and we began working together. For a young skater, he was incredibly open-minded. At our club, we always start by working on the fundamentals,¬†which can be quite technical. It‚Äôs a bit of a boring practice, so I often joke with skaters, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like going to the dentist.‚Äù It‚Äôs necessary for you, but not something you‚Äôd willingly choose to do. But Yuzu trusted us and embraced our methods. In the end, I had the amazing experience of learning just as much from him as I taught him.

Coaching him was also a huge challenge for us too, because it revealed things we needed to learn about ourselves and our weaknesses. But once we understood those, we could truly grow and move to the next level. You can imagine how hard it is to coach someone like Yuzu, who is both a talented athlete and an artist. I often lay in bed at night thinking about how to structure a lesson, how to turn an idea into exercises. It was tough, but also really fun. Looking back, I truly feel we learned as much as we taught.

‚Äî So he was truly special. Not only for his skating talent but also as a person.

Tracy: Yes, he is special. Sometimes, life brings you people like that, and I knew right away that he was something special. Having an athlete like Yuzu in your care is something very rare and special. I‚Äôm truly grateful. For example, when we were practicing footwork, sometimes an idea would pop into my head: ‚ÄúHe might be able to do this.‚Äù Usually, you can imagine things freely, but turning that mental image into reality is a different matter. But he could do it! He had that ability. He's someone who took us to another world, both creatively and technically. He always knew exactly what he wanted to do, where he was going, and what level he wanted to take his skating to. He always focused on the big picture of what he was doing, rather than how it would be perceived by the outside world.

‚Äî As someone mainly responsible for his skating skills, what was your impression of his skating when he joined the Cricket Club?

Tracy: At just 17, he already had a natural gift. And more than anything, he had a genuine love for what he was doing. He was still a bit rough around the edges. A diamond in the rough, you might say. But that‚Äôs what made it fun and interesting. A great learning experience. He had ability. He had drive. He was dedicated. He was curious. He loved putting in the effort.¬†He had this rare feeling that the harder he worked, the more fun it became. He completely immersed himself in practice.¬†His potential was limitless. That said, having potential and realizing it are two very different things.

‚Äî So how did your coaching plan change to bring out that limitless potential?

Tracy: I kind of followed his path.¬†Always keeping in mind what he wanted from me, what he needed at that moment, and what would make a difference for his present and future. The hard work and repetitive tasks in the early days were tough, but eventually he came to realize how useful they were, how much he could gain from them, and that became rewarding for him.¬†That was probably the hardest part. Once he realized that, it was all good.¬†He had a strong foundation, he was a quick learner, and he never forgot what he'd learned.

From there, the focus shifted to observing his competitive performances. What does he need two minutes into the program? Three minutes in? What does his skating require? What helps him settle in before skating? My job was to watch him, understand what he needed, and adapt to that.

‚Äî When you watched his performances, what kind of feelings did you have?

Tracy: I was excited!¬†There's really no point in obsessing about the results or worrying too much. Just feel the energy and believe. I just trust him. Even if the result wasn‚Äôt his best, that meant it was something he needed at that moment. Even if a jump didn‚Äôt go well,¬†it was just a stepping stone to something even greater in the future. So I just trusted whatever he did. It was a kind of nervous excitement. Absolute trust and curiosity about what he would show us, and what kind of performance it would become.

‚Äî As his skating coach, what‚Äôs your favorite part of his skating?

Tracy: Everything.¬†With Yuzu, everything is one seamless whole. He is an athlete. And he personifies what figure skating¬†is supposed to be.¬†That means a perfect balance of athleticism and artistry. I think that's what makes this sport so unique, and Yuzu possesses that perfect balance.¬†So, I love every aspect of him, and it's hard to pinpoint just one. His jumps? No, no. His artistry? Or his musicality? All of it. He has no weaknesses. I‚Äôve watched so many skaters over the years as a commentator. Some are more like athletes, some are more like artists. But skaters like Yuzu are very rare. He has it all. In¬†the world of figure skating, that‚Äôs incredibly uncommon. If you're too focused on one aspect, the magical allure disappears. But he balances everything so exquisitely, and that‚Äôs what makes him a truly special skater.

‚Äî While he seems capable of doing everything, were there also challenges for him?

Tracy: He addresses every issue head-on. He never ignores a problem and tries every possible approach: ‚ÄúHow about this? What‚Äôs happening here?‚Äù For an artist to be truly free, they need a solid foundation. If the base is even slightly shaky, they‚Äôll lose their balance.¬†That's not freedom. That‚Äôs exactly what Yuzu worked on.¬†When he‚Äôs in good health and fully immersed in training, there are moments when he completely loses himself. Not thinking about technique, not checking movements or feelings, he just becomes one with the program. He surrenders himself to the music, to the connection with the audience. To me, that‚Äôs the ""ultimate goal."" And he's able to reach it thanks to his training.

‚Äî Is that what athletes often call being ‚Äúin the zone‚Äù?

Tracy: Yes, it‚Äôs something like that.

‚Äî Were tangible results like medals and titles part of his motivation?

Tracy: Yes, achievements like that definitely motivated him. They gave him great satisfaction, and surpassing each one became a way for him to measure his own abilities.

¬†‚Äî I think he‚Äôs the kind of athlete who sets high goals and finds joy in reaching them. Would you say the quadruple Axel is a symbol of that mindset?

Tracy: I think so. When I think back to Yuzu and his various personal challenges, he always had a very clear intention. I remember talking to him after he won his second Olympic gold medal. At that time, I strongly encouraged him to further expand the limits of his artistry. He really has remarkable artistic ability. At the same time, in today‚Äôs figure skating world, technical elements and jump rotations heavily influence scores. So I understood that he had to keep pushing in that area too. In that sense, his attempt at the quadruple Axel was a pure challenge for him. When Yuzu sets a goal, it‚Äôs not here (gestures at table level), or here (around the face), it‚Äôs up here (gestures above the head).

Before anyone else had even considered it, he had already begun challenging the quad Axel. I remember seeing him trying it in practice and being amazed, like, ‚ÄúWhat?! What are you doing?!‚Äù And as you all know, when he commits to something, it‚Äôs never half-hearted. He throws himself into it completely. I was a bit worried about the toll on his body, of course. But at the same time, I felt like I was witnessing something special. Back then, no one even spoke about a quad Axel. It was incredible. Eventually, it became like, ‚ÄúOh, he‚Äôs doing it again.‚Äù (laughs)

‚Äî Even someone as determined as he is must have his ups and downs. What about those times?

Tracy: Yes, that's natural, isn't it? That's life.¬†And it's those ups and downs that allow us to reach greater heights.¬†In Yuzu's case, I strongly believe that the process of coming back from a setback is what shaped him.¬†It's all about how he bounces back. He never gives up. He never loses hope. And he never abandons the vision of what he wants to achieve. I think it's those moments of struggle that make him such a great athlete. Ever since I met him, and even before that, everything he went through, all the rock bottoms he experienced, they shaped him and brought him to where he is now. So, it's fair to say that without those experiences, he wouldn‚Äôt be who he is today.

‚Äî¬†I think Hanyu must have been fortunate to have found coaches who shared his belief in what he wanted to achieve, and his success can be said to be the result of teamwork.¬†

Tracy: I think Yuzu knew exactly what he needed, and that led him to us.¬†From our perspective, it felt like, ‚ÄúHow lucky are we!‚Äù That‚Äôs life, isn‚Äôt it? Life gives you these opportunities and challenges. Brian (Orser) and I are simply grateful. I hope that everyone involved has felt it was worthwhile, and when that happens, I feel the greatest joy.

‚Äî I imagine having Javier Fernandez at the Cricket Club was a big inspiration too.

Tracy: Javi and Yuzu (smiles). It was a lot of fun. Of course, the two of them training together was also quite a challenge. Sometimes they‚Äôd clash, other times they deeply cared for each other.¬†It was a wonderful experience for them.¬†And we had to adapt, too, to make sure this was a win-win for everyone. We had to think about what was best for the sport and the club. We are part of a greater whole, and by respecting and honoring that, we ourselves can be elevated. Javi and Yuzu both pushed each other to grow because they had each other. It was amazing to see how they supported each other.

‚Äî They pushed and inspired each other to excel.

¬†Tracy: It's all down to their excellence. When Yuzu was taking a short break and Javi started doing quadruple jumps, Yuzu would start jumping like crazy. Or, if Javi came onto the ice holding a coffee and was leisurely preparing, and Yuzu was already landing a beautiful triple Axel, Javi would immediately put the coffee down and jump right into training. It was such a great dynamic.

¬†Javi is very calm, friendly, and easy-going.¬†On the other hand, Yuzu is a fiery, passionate guy, always pushing himself with a 'Go! Go!' kind of energy. So, I think they each needed a bit of what the other had. Sometimes Yuzu needed moments to loosen up, and sometimes Javi needed a bit of a kick in the butt, you know? (laughs)""

‚Äî That's a wonderful relationship. What was it like having Hanyu at the Cricket Club?

Tracy: Having Yuzu there was absolutely wonderful. You can‚Äôt have someone like him around and not benefit from it or feel motivated. The same goes for Javi, of course.¬†But we didn‚Äôt dwell on that too much. We just focused on enjoying our time together and creating good energy. The rink isn‚Äôt just a place for practice. The club is a community.¬†We have young skaters and adult skaters. It‚Äôs a place to share the joy of this sport. This rink is truly special. And it‚Äôs about using that energy positively: with gratitude, skating with passion and joy, and making efforts to uplift each other.¬†It takes a tremendous amount of hard work here, but it‚Äôs important to remember how lucky we are to be able to do that. Having someone like Yuzu there really helped create that energy.¬†He keeps everyone motivated.

‚Äî Without the Cricket Club, his career might have been different.¬†

Tracy: When Brian and I started this club, it felt like home to us. We wanted to create a community for all skaters. A place where elite skaters could have a family that provides a sense of belonging and enrichment, and where they could grow both as individuals and as athletes. Our goal was for skaters to become stronger through this sport, not become discouraged by it. If that is our vision and our mission, then being able to see Yuzu‚Äôs growth fills us with great happiness.

¬†‚Äî What do you hope for him as he embarks on this new path as a professional skater?

Tracy: I feel that he has much more to offer. And I want him to continue to lead the figure skating world, as he has done so far. I hope he can do that from his heart, from that pure part of himself that matters most to him.

‚Äî He said that this is the opposite of retirement. Rather, it‚Äôs a further challenge.

Tracy: I expect the same. Anything less and he wouldn‚Äôt be satisfied. He won't find fulfillment from just relaxing or taking it easy. That‚Äôs not who he is. Artistically, technically, and emotionally, he has such incredible depth. With that, he can do so much.¬†And when he gets a clear image of what he wants to create, he has the vision and the ability to bring it to life. So, I'm really excited about his future career.

‚Äî¬†In competition, you have to keep the scoring system in mind, which means there were probably times when he had to compromise on the overall expression or completeness of a program.

Tracy: That's absolutely true. Rules are rules, and they're absolute.¬†And the scoring system exists. I‚Äôm not here to dispute that. But it‚Äôs impossible to keep a skater like Yuzu locked in a box forever. Now he‚Äôs free, and I‚Äôm excited to see just how far his love for this sport and his incredible talent will take him.

‚Äî Maybe we‚Äôll see even more of his true essence now?

Tracy: I hope so too. For Yuzu, and for the sport itself.

‚Äî Until now, turning pro has been seen as the end of one's career, but Hanyu might set a new trend.

Tracy: That's exactly what I hope for. That he becomes a pioneer in professional skating and leads the way forward. If anyone can do that, it‚Äôs Yuzu. He can open new doors.¬†Perhaps the skating world will watch and learn from what Yuzu does, and may even redefine some of the rules for the sake of the sport‚Äôs development. That‚Äôs completely unknown territory, but I‚Äôm excited to see what‚Äôs possible.¬†For now, let‚Äôs wait and see what Yuzu does next. What I feel strongly is that this sport needs to keep evolving, so I‚Äôm excited to see how things unfold from here.

‚Äî What kind of impact does he have on this world?

Tracy: He is surely an existence that transcends sports. My husband is a former rugby player, but he is moved when he sees Yuzu skate. You don‚Äôt have to be a figure skating fan to like him. Whether a musician, a soccer player, or a doctor, he has a charm that attracts people from all walks of life. Watching Yuzu is like feeling his power and witnessing a genius.

¬†‚Äî Is there any performance of his that you particularly liked?

Tracy:¬†I loved them all. Every single one. Each had its own unique story and meaning, so I can‚Äôt pick just one. There are simply too many.

‚Äî What did you think of the Beijing Olympics?

Tracy: Whether I was commentating or just watching, it was the same. We‚Äôve always been connected, and in fact, we saw each other backstage. So I think he could feel that I was supporting him. During competitions, I‚Äôm always at the venue as a commentator, so it all felt like a natural continuation of things.¬†And of course, I was thinking of him. Especially after the short program, I had a lot of thoughts and feelings. That must have been a really tough experience for him.¬† He said afterward that he'd fallen into a rut. But I know that Yuzu is greater than just one performance or one skate.¬†And things like accidents are just fleeting moments. I knew he would overcome it.¬†And it was a dramatic ending, wasn‚Äôt it? As always! (laughs)

‚Äî I'm sure you'll continue to stay in touch with him in the future. How do you feel when you look back on the past 10 years together?

Tracy: It feels like family. There were siblings, children, and we watched their growth.¬†And with Yuzu as well, we watched his growth, and he has grown to stand on his own independently as both an artist and an athlete, and now he is leaping into the professional world.¬†Looking back, it's been an incredible journey for us, and we were able to build a wonderful relationship. I believe that this relationship will continue to grow even more from here on.¬†While he was here, he grew from a young man into an adult.¬†To have been able to spend such a valuable period in one person‚Äôs life together, I truly feel it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I feel very honored.

‚Äî Thank you very much. Finally, please give a message to Hanyu.

Tracy: Hi, Yuzu! I wish you all the best in your training, and I encourage you to keep being driven by your inner talent and love for this sport. Please continue to lead this sport. It‚Äôs so great to have you in it, and I can‚Äôt wait to see what you‚Äôll create in your next adventure. See you!

‚Äî And a message for the fans, too?

Tracy: To all his fans, please continue to support him and keep chasing dreams together with him. Yuzu is truly extraordinary, and this sport needs someone like him to continue to lead us. He is absolutely what makes our sport so unique, the perfect combination of artistry and athleticism. Now moving on to a new stage, it‚Äôs going to allow him to redefine himself and redefine the sport. It‚Äôs going to be very exciting. I hope I‚Äôm in the stands with you soon down the road, watching his next adventure. Take care!

In a world where everyone seems to be running low on energy, it's tough to find a supplement that actually works without relying on heavy stimulants.

That's why when I heard about Mitolyn, a mitochondrial support supplement, I was intrigued ‚Äî but also skeptical. Lots of products promise the world and deliver little.

After trying Mitolyn consistently for 8 weeks, I‚Äôm honestly impressed.

This isn‚Äôt just another energy pill ‚Äî it‚Äôs something different, and in this review, I‚Äôll explain exactly what happened for me and why I think it‚Äôs worth considering.

What Makes Mitolyn Special?

Mitolyn focuses on something most supplements ignore: mitochondrial health.

Instead of just masking fatigue with caffeine, it supports your body‚Äôs ability to create real energy at the cellular level.

That difference matters.

When your mitochondria are healthy, everything improves ‚Äî from your brain function to your workout performance to how fast you recover from stress.

What sets Mitolyn apart is the quality and synergy of its ingredients. Here's what‚Äôs inside:

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Essential for cellular energy production and antioxidant protection.

PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Promotes the creation of new mitochondria (a rare benefit in supplements).

N-Acetyl L-Carnitine: Boosts mental clarity and physical energy.

Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A powerful antioxidant that enhances mitochondrial function.

Resveratrol: Famous for supporting longevity and fighting oxidative stress.

Magnesium and B Vitamins: Vital cofactors for energy metabolism.

In other words, Mitolyn isn‚Äôt throwing random ingredients together ‚Äî it‚Äôs built around a clear, science-backed strategy.

My First Month with Mitolyn: What I Noticed

When I first started taking Mitolyn, I made sure to keep the rest of my habits the same (no new workouts, no changes in diet) to really see what the supplement could do.

Week 1-2:

At first, I didn‚Äôt feel much difference. I knew real mitochondrial support would take time, so I stayed patient.

Week 3:

This is when I started noticing something exciting: I had a steady, natural energy throughout the day. Not a wired or hyper feeling, just a solid baseline of ""I can handle anything.""

Week 4:

By the end of the month, I realized I hadn‚Äôt been reaching for coffee in the afternoons anymore. Plus, my focus at work was sharper, and my workouts felt noticeably stronger.

Another bonus: my mood seemed more even. I didn't get frustrated as easily and felt more grounded overall.

The Real Benefits I Experienced

Consistent Energy: I‚Äôm no longer dragging myself through afternoons. My energy feels ""clean,"" not forced.

Enhanced Cognitive Performance: Tasks like writing, strategic planning, and learning new skills became easier. Less mental fatigue.

Better Workouts and Recovery: More stamina during cardio and faster recovery afterward.

Improved Stress Resilience: Life feels less overwhelming, even during busy weeks.

Subtle Anti-Aging Effects: I can't scientifically measure it, but I honestly feel younger ‚Äî more vibrant and ""alive.""

Pros and Cons of Mitolyn

Pros:

Clean, research-based ingredient list

No stimulants, no crash

Noticeable improvements after consistent use

Supports both mind and body

Manufactured with high quality standards

Vegan, non-GMO, free of common allergens

Cons:

Takes a few weeks to fully notice effects (not instant)

Slightly higher price point than typical energy supplements

Only available online (not sold in physical stores easily)

Who Might Benefit from Mitolyn?

In my opinion, Mitolyn is a fantastic choice if you:

Feel chronically tired, even with enough sleep

Struggle with focus, memory, or mental sharpness

Want better exercise performance and recovery

Are interested in slowing the aging process naturally

Prefer science-backed, non-stimulant supplements

However, if you‚Äôre just looking for a quick caffeine buzz, Mitolyn probably isn‚Äôt for you.

This is a supplement for people who want deep, lasting improvements.

Is Mitolyn Worth the Money?

Short answer: Yes, absolutely ‚Äî especially if you care about your long-term energy, brain health, and vitality.

I see Mitolyn as an investment. Instead of spending money every day on coffees, energy drinks, or ""band-aid"" supplements, I‚Äôm fueling my body to produce its own energy more efficiently.

Given the quality of ingredients, the careful formulation, and the results I've personally experienced, I think the value is definitely there.

Final Thoughts: Would I Recommend Mitolyn?

Without hesitation, yes.

Mitolyn is now part of my daily health stack, and I plan to keep using it for the long term.

Mitolyn reviews are everywhere this year, but if you‚Äôve noticed, they don‚Äôt all tell the same story. Some are packed with glowing reports about restored energy, shrinking waistlines, and feeling like your metabolism finally woke up. Others sound like outright horror stories ‚Äì talking about headaches, stomach problems, or ‚Äúit did absolutely nothing.‚Äù It‚Äôs left a lot of people confused. Is Mitolyn a miracle for stubborn fat and constant fatigue‚Ä¶ or a complete scam?

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs really happening in 2025: Mitolyn has become a serious threat to a billion-dollar industry that‚Äôs built around quick, harsh stimulant fat burners. Those products don‚Äôt fix the actual root of why so many people struggle with fatigue, sugar cravings, and stubborn fat. Mitolyn goes deeper ‚Äì straight to the mitochondria, the little energy engines inside your cells that decide how your body burns calories, how balanced your hormones stay, and whether you store fat or burn it.

¬†  
When word got out that Mitolyn was helping thousands break through years of low energy and fat loss plateaus by targeting mitochondrial dysfunction, the big players in the weight loss market did not take it lightly. That‚Äôs why all over the internet, you see what looks like ‚ÄúMitolyn complaints‚Äù or alarming ‚ÄúMitolyn side effects‚Äù posts. Many of these so-called reviews aren‚Äôt from real users at all ‚Äì they‚Äôre cooked up by competitors or shady resellers who are terrified of losing customers.

On top of that, there‚Äôs been a flood of fake Mitolyn bottles hitting online marketplaces. Scammers on auction sites and even pop-up supplement stores try to capitalize on Mitolyn‚Äôs good name. They ship out cheap knockoff capsules that barely have any active ingredients ‚Äì if any at all. When unsuspecting people take these counterfeits and don‚Äôt see results, or worse, feel sick because of who-knows-what‚Äôs in them, they understandably leave angry reviews. And just like that, real Mitolyn gets blamed for a problem caused by greedy criminals who hijacked its brand.

  
Want proof? In May and June 2025 alone, consumer protection agencies logged over 1,800 complaints tied to counterfeit Mitolyn being sold on third-party sites. None of these buyers went through the Mitolyn Official Website, which is the only place you get real product batches that are GMP-certified, safety tested, and covered by a no-hassle 60-day money-back guarantee.

That‚Äôs also why most verified Mitolyn reviews that come from people who bought direct ‚Äì from the real manufacturer ‚Äì sound completely different. They talk about a gradual but steady return of energy, easier mornings, clothes fitting better after 6-8 weeks, and sugar cravings dropping off without crazy willpower battles. They‚Äôre not magical overnight results, because Mitolyn isn‚Äôt a caffeine bomb or appetite suppressant that shocks your system. It‚Äôs designed to rebuild how your cells make energy and regulate fat over time.

  
So when you see all these mixed Mitolyn reviews popping up in 2025, know there‚Äôs a reason. Competitors and shady resellers are doing everything they can to keep their market share safe ‚Äì even if that means flooding social media with scare stories, posting misleading Reddit threads, or paying low-level websites to spread half-truths. It‚Äôs old news in the supplement world, but for honest people just trying to get their health back, it can be hard to spot.

Bottom line: don‚Äôt let fake sellers or jealous rivals scare you off. If you want to see what Mitolyn can really do, protect yourself by getting it only from the Mitolyn Official Website (73% Off). That way you avoid all the counterfeits, all the shady bait-and-switch schemes, and you‚Äôre covered by the same 60-day guarantee that‚Äôs helped thousands of cautious first-time buyers try it with zero risk.

How Does Mitolyn Actually Work To Reset Metabolism And Boost Energy At The Cellular Level

¬†  
Mitolyn has triggered a near seismic shift in how functional medicine clinics and metabolic researchers think about fat loss. Unlike typical weight control solutions that lean heavily on appetite suppression or adrenaline-triggered calorie burning, Mitolyn operates at the mitochondrial level. This distinction is why countless Mitolyn Reviews keep stressing that it is not simply a fat burner, but rather a bioenergetic recalibration protocol. The implications for long-term weight management and fatigue resistance are profound.

  
Mitochondria are often called the cellular power plants, responsible for turning nutrients from food into ATP ‚Äì the usable energy that drives virtually every metabolic process. New data compiled in 2025 by the Global Institute for Metabolic Restoration revealed that over 72 percent of adults struggling with weight loss plateaus or unexplained fatigue show clear biochemical markers of mitochondrial dysfunction. That means these individuals aren‚Äôt necessarily overeating or under-exercising ‚Äì their cells are literally failing to produce adequate energy, slowing metabolism at the most fundamental level.

¬†  
Mitolyn targets this bottleneck through a precise combination of clinically supported compounds: CoQ10, PQQ, acetyl-L-carnitine, NAD+ precursors, resveratrol, D-ribose, and magnesium bisglycinate. Each of these has been individually studied for their capacity to spark mitochondrial biogenesis (creation of new mitochondria), bolster electron transport chain efficiency, reduce oxidative membrane damage, and stabilize hormonal cascades tied to hunger and fat storage.

¬†

After trying Mitolyn consistently for 8 weeks, I‚Äôm honestly impressed. This isn‚Äôt just another energy pill ‚Äî it‚Äôs something different, and in this review, I‚Äôll explain exactly what happened for me and why I think it‚Äôs worth considering.

What Makes Mitolyn Special? Mitolyn focuses on something most supplements ignore: mitochondrial health. Instead of just masking fatigue with caffeine, it supports your body‚Äôs ability to create real energy at the cellular level.

  
That difference matters. When your mitochondria are healthy, everything improves ‚Äî from your brain function to your workout performance to how fast you recover from stress.

What sets Mitolyn apart is the quality and synergy of its ingredients. Here's what‚Äôs inside:

  
Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Essential for cellular energy production and antioxidant protection.

  
PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Promotes the creation of new mitochondria (a rare benefit in supplements).

N-Acetyl L-Carnitine: Boosts mental clarity and physical energy.

¬†

  
Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A powerful antioxidant that enhances mitochondrial function.

  
Resveratrol: Famous for supporting longevity and fighting oxidative stress.

Magnesium and B Vitamins: Vital cofactors for energy metabolism.

  
In other words, Mitolyn isn‚Äôt throwing random ingredients together ‚Äî it‚Äôs built around a clear, science-backed strategy.

My First Month with Mitolyn: What I Noticed When I first started taking Mitolyn, I made sure to keep the rest of my habits the same (no new workouts, no changes in diet) to really see what the supplement could do.

  
Week 1-2: At first, I didn‚Äôt feel much difference. I knew real mitochondrial support would take time, so I stayed patient.

Week 3: This is when I started noticing something exciting: I had a steady, natural energy throughout the day. Not a wired or hyper feeling, just a solid baseline of ""I can handle anything.""

  
Week 4: By the end of the month, I realized I hadn‚Äôt been reaching for coffee in the afternoons anymore. Plus, my focus at work was sharper, and my workouts felt noticeably stronger. Another bonus: my mood seemed more even. I didn't get frustrated as easily and felt more grounded overall

The Real Benefits I Experienced Consistent Energy: I‚Äôm no longer dragging myself through afternoons. My energy feels ""clean,"" not forced.

¬†

  
Enhanced Cognitive Performance: Tasks like writing, strategic planning, and learning new skills became easier. Less mental fatigue.

Better Workouts and Recovery: More stamina during cardio and faster recovery afterward.

  
Improved Stress Resilience: Life feels less overwhelming, even during busy weeks.

  
Subtle Anti-Aging Effects: I can't scientifically measure it, but I honestly feel younger ‚Äî more vibrant and ""alive.""

Pros and Cons of Mitolyn Pros:

Clean, research-based ingredient list

No stimulants, no crash

Noticeable improvements after consistent use

Supports both mind and body

Manufactured with high quality standards

Vegan, non-GMO, free of common allergens

Cons:

Takes a few weeks to fully notice effects (not instant)

Slightly higher price point than typical energy supplements

¬†

  
Only available online (not sold in physical stores easily)

Who Might Benefit from Mitolyn? In my opinion, Mitolyn is a fantastic choice if you:

Feel chronically tired, even with enough sleep

Struggle with focus, memory, or mental sharpness

Want better exercise performance and recovery

Are interested in slowing the aging process naturally

Prefer science-backed, non-stimulant supplements

However, if you‚Äôre just looking for a quick caffeine buzz, Mitolyn probably isn‚Äôt for you. This is a supplement for people who want deep, lasting improvements.

Is Mitolyn Worth the Money? Short answer: Yes, absolutely ‚Äî especially if you care about your long-term energy, brain health, and vitality.

  
I see Mitolyn as an investment. Instead of spending money every day on coffees, energy drinks, or ""band-aid"" supplements, I‚Äôm fueling my body to produce its own energy more efficiently.

Given the quality of ingredients, the careful formulation, and the results I've personally experienced, I think the value is definitely there.

  
Final Thoughts: Would I Recommend Mitolyn? Without hesitation, yes. Mitolyn is now part of my daily health stack, and I plan to keep using it for the long term

What sets Mitolyn apart ‚Äì and gets repeated in thousands of Mitolyn Reviews ‚Äì is its orchestration of these mechanisms simultaneously. Where a standalone CoQ10 might mildly support ATP output, Mitolyn combines it with PQQ to amplify mitochondrial proliferation. Where acetyl-L-carnitine helps shuttle fatty acids into mitochondria, D-ribose ensures these mitochondria have the raw fuel to produce abundant ATP. Resveratrol steps in to moderate inflammatory processes and protect mitochondrial DNA from degradation. Together, they form what experts are increasingly calling a multi-vector metabolic reset

They talk about a gradual but steady return of energy, easier mornings, clothes fitting better after 6-8 weeks, and sugar cravings dropping off without crazy willpower battles. They‚Äôre not magical overnight results, because Mitolyn isn‚Äôt a caffeine bomb or appetite suppressant that shocks your system. It‚Äôs designed to rebuild how your cells make energy and regulate fat over time.

  
So when you see all these mixed Mitolyn reviews popping up in 2025, know there‚Äôs a reason. Competitors and shady resellers are doing everything they can to keep their market share safe ‚Äì even if that means flooding social media with scare stories, posting misleading Reddit threads, or paying low-level websites to spread half-truths. It‚Äôs old news in the supplement world, but for honest people just trying to get their health back, it can be hard to spot.

Bottom line: don‚Äôt let fake sellers or jealous rivals scare you off. If you want to see what Mitolyn can really do, protect yourself by getting it only from the Mitolyn Official Website (73% Off). That way you avoid all the counterfeits, all the shady bait-and-switch schemes, and you‚Äôre covered by the same 60-day guarantee that‚Äôs helped thousands of cautious first-time buyers try it with zero risk.

How Does Mitolyn Actually Work To Reset Metabolism And Boost Energy At The Cellular Level

¬†  
Mitolyn has triggered a near seismic shift in how functional medicine clinics and metabolic researchers think about fat loss. Unlike typical weight control solutions that lean heavily on appetite suppression or adrenaline-triggered calorie burning, Mitolyn operates at the mitochondrial level. This distinction is why countless Mitolyn Reviews keep stressing that it is not simply a fat burner, but rather a bioenergetic recalibration protocol. The implications for long-term weight management and fatigue resistance are profound.

  
Mitochondria are often called the cellular power plants, responsible for turning nutrients from food into ATP ‚Äì the usable energy that drives virtually every metabolic process. New data compiled in 2025 by the Global Institute for Metabolic Restoration revealed that over 72 percent of adults struggling with weight loss plateaus or unexplained fatigue show clear biochemical markers of mitochondrial dysfunction. That means these individuals aren‚Äôt necessarily overeating or under-exercising ‚Äì their cells are literally failing to produce adequate energy, slowing metabolism at the most fundamental level.

¬†  
Mitolyn targets this bottleneck through a precise combination of clinically supported compounds: CoQ10, PQQ, acetyl-L-carnitine, NAD+ precursors, resveratrol, D-ribose, and magnesium bisglycinate. Each of these has been individually studied for their capacity to spark mitochondrial biogenesis (creation of new mitochondria), bolster electron transport chain efficiency, reduce oxidative membrane damage, and stabilize hormonal cascades tied to hunger and fat storage.

¬†

After trying Mitolyn consistently for 8 weeks, I‚Äôm honestly impressed. This isn‚Äôt just another energy pill ‚Äî it‚Äôs something different, and in this review, I‚Äôll explain exactly what happened for me and why I think it‚Äôs worth considering.

What Makes Mitolyn Special? Mitolyn focuses on something most supplements ignore: mitochondrial health. Instead of just masking fatigue with caffeine, it supports your body‚Äôs ability to create real energy at the cellular level.

  
That difference matters. When your mitochondria are healthy, everything improves ‚Äî from your brain function to your workout performance to how fast you recover from stress.

What sets Mitolyn apart is the quality and synergy of its ingredients. Here's what‚Äôs inside:

  
Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Essential for cellular energy production and antioxidant protection.

  
PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Promotes the creation of new mitochondria (a rare benefit in supplements).

N-Acetyl L-Carnitine: Boosts mental clarity and physical energy.

¬†

  
Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A powerful antioxidant that enhances mitochondrial function.

  
Resveratrol: Famous for supporting longevity and fighting oxidative stress.

Magnesium and B Vitamins: Vital cofactors for energy metabolism.

  
In other words, Mitolyn isn‚Äôt throwing random ingredients together ‚Äî it‚Äôs built around a clear, science-backed strategy.

My First Month with Mitolyn: What I Noticed When I first started taking Mitolyn, I made sure to keep the rest of my habits the same (no new workouts, no changes in diet) to really see what the supplement could do.

  
Week 1-2: At first, I didn‚Äôt feel much difference. I knew real mitochondrial support would take time, so I stayed patient.

Week 3: This is when I started noticing something exciting: I had a steady, natural energy throughout the day. Not a wired or hyper feeling, just a solid baseline of ""I can handle anything.""

  
Week 4: By the end of the month, I realized I hadn‚Äôt been reaching for coffee in the afternoons anymore. Plus, my focus at work was sharper, and my workouts felt noticeably stronger. Another bonus: my mood seemed more even. I didn't get frustrated as easily and felt more grounded overall

The Real Benefits I Experienced Consistent Energy: I‚Äôm no longer dragging myself through afternoons. My energy feels ""clean,"" not forced.

¬†

  
Enhanced Cognitive Performance: Tasks like writing, strategic planning, and learning new skills became easier. Less mental fatigue.

Better Workouts and Recovery: More stamina during cardio and faster recovery afterward.

  
Improved Stress Resilience: Life feels less overwhelming, even during busy weeks.

  
Subtle Anti-Aging Effects: I can't scientifically measure it, but I honestly feel younger ‚Äî more vibrant and ""alive.""

Pros and Cons of Mitolyn Pros:

Clean, research-based ingredient list

No stimulants, no crash

Noticeable improvements after consistent use

Supports both mind and body

Manufactured with high quality standards

Vegan, non-GMO, free of common allergens

Cons:

Takes a few weeks to fully notice effects (not instant)

Slightly higher price point than typical energy supplements

¬†

  
Only available online (not sold in physical stores easily)

Who Might Benefit from Mitolyn? In my opinion, Mitolyn is a fantastic choice if you:

Feel chronically tired, even with enough sleep

Struggle with focus, memory, or mental sharpness

Want better exercise performance and recovery

Are interested in slowing the aging process naturally

Prefer science-backed, non-stimulant supplements

However, if you‚Äôre just looking for a quick caffeine buzz, Mitolyn probably isn‚Äôt for you. This is a supplement for people who want deep, lasting improvements.

Is Mitolyn Worth the Money? Short answer: Yes, absolutely ‚Äî especially if you care about your long-term energy, brain health, and vitality.

  
I see Mitolyn as an investment. Instead of spending money every day on coffees, energy drinks, or ""band-aid"" supplements, I‚Äôm fueling my body to produce its own energy more efficiently.

Given the quality of ingredients, the careful formulation, and the results I've personally experienced, I think the value is definitely there.

  
Final Thoughts: Would I Recommend Mitolyn? Without hesitation, yes. Mitolyn is now part of my daily health stack, and I plan to keep using it for the long term

¬†

What sets Mitolyn apart ‚Äì and gets repeated in thousands of Mitolyn Reviews ‚Äì is its orchestration of these mechanisms simultaneously. Where a standalone CoQ10 might mildly support ATP output, Mitolyn combines it with PQQ to amplify mitochondrial proliferation. Where acetyl-L-carnitine helps shuttle fatty acids into mitochondria, D-ribose ensures these mitochondria have the raw fuel to produce abundant ATP. Resveratrol steps in to moderate inflammatory processes and protect mitochondrial DNA from degradation. Together, they form what experts are increasingly calling a multi-vector metabolic reset

Perhaps the most compelling clinical clue comes from a double-blind study published in the Journal of Mitochondrial Therapeutics in May 2025. Researchers tracked 180 participants over 12 weeks using a mitochondrial stack nearly identical to Mitolyn‚Äôs composition. Results included a 19 percent rise in resting metabolic rate, a 31 percent drop in subjective fatigue scores, and notable improvements in fasting insulin markers ‚Äì all without the adrenal strain linked to stimulant-based solutions.",1,1755189822.0,OKRABLEACH,2,1.0,False

Mitolyn reviews are everywhere this year, but if you‚Äôve noticed, they don‚Äôt all tell the same story. Some are packed with glowing reports about restored energy, shrinking waistlines, and feeling like your metabolism finally woke up. Others sound like outright horror stories ‚Äì talking about headaches, stomach problems, or ‚Äúit did absolutely nothing.‚Äù It‚Äôs left a lot of people confused. Is Mitolyn a miracle for stubborn fat and constant fatigue‚Ä¶ or a complete scam?

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs really happening in 2025: Mitolyn has become a serious threat to a billion-dollar industry that‚Äôs built around quick, harsh stimulant fat burners. Those products don‚Äôt fix the actual root of why so many people struggle with fatigue, sugar cravings, and stubborn fat. Mitolyn goes deeper ‚Äì straight to the mitochondria, the little energy engines inside your cells that decide how your body burns calories, how balanced your hormones stay, and whether you store fat or burn it.

¬†  
When word got out that Mitolyn was helping thousands break through years of low energy and fat loss plateaus by targeting mitochondrial dysfunction, the big players in the weight loss market did not take it lightly. That‚Äôs why all over the internet, you see what looks like ‚ÄúMitolyn complaints‚Äù or alarming ‚ÄúMitolyn side effects‚Äù posts. Many of these so-called reviews aren‚Äôt from real users at all ‚Äì they‚Äôre cooked up by competitors or shady resellers who are terrified of losing customers.

On top of that, there‚Äôs been a flood of fake Mitolyn bottles hitting online marketplaces. Scammers on auction sites and even pop-up supplement stores try to capitalize on Mitolyn‚Äôs good name. They ship out cheap knockoff capsules that barely have any active ingredients ‚Äì if any at all. When unsuspecting people take these counterfeits and don‚Äôt see results, or worse, feel sick because of who-knows-what‚Äôs in them, they understandably leave angry reviews. And just like that, real Mitolyn gets blamed for a problem caused by greedy criminals who hijacked its brand.

  
Want proof? In May and June 2025 alone, consumer protection agencies logged over 1,800 complaints tied to counterfeit Mitolyn being sold on third-party sites. None of these buyers went through the Mitolyn Official Website, which is the only place you get real product batches that are GMP-certified, safety tested, and covered by a no-hassle 60-day money-back guarantee.

Week 3: This is when I started noticing something exciting: I had a steady, natural energy throughout the day. Not a wired or hyper feeling, just a solid baseline of ""I can handle anything.""

  
Week 4: By the end of the month, I realized I hadn‚Äôt been reaching for coffee in the afternoons anymore. Plus, my focus at work was sharper, and my workouts felt noticeably stronger. Another bonus: my mood seemed more even. I didn't get frustrated as easily and felt more grounded overall

The Real Benefits I Experienced Consistent Energy: I‚Äôm no longer dragging myself through afternoons. My energy feels ""clean,"" not forced.

¬†

  
Enhanced Cognitive Performance: Tasks like writing, strategic planning, and learning new skills became easier. Less mental fatigue.

Better Workouts and Recovery: More stamina during cardio and faster recovery afterward.

  
Improved Stress Resilience: Life feels less overwhelming, even during busy weeks.

  
Subtle Anti-Aging Effects: I can't scientifically measure it, but I honestly feel younger ‚Äî more vibrant and ""alive.""

What sets Mitolyn apart ‚Äì and gets repeated in thousands of Mitolyn Reviews ‚Äì is its orchestration of these mechanisms simultaneously. Where a standalone CoQ10 might mildly support ATP output, Mitolyn combines it with PQQ to amplify mitochondrial proliferation. Where acetyl-L-carnitine helps shuttle fatty acids into mitochondria, D-ribose ensures these mitochondria have the raw fuel to produce abundant ATP. Resveratrol steps in to moderate inflammatory processes and protect mitochondrial DNA from degradation. Together, they form what experts are increasingly calling a multi-vector metabolic reset

Perhaps the most compelling clinical clue comes from a double-blind study published in the Journal of Mitochondrial Therapeutics in May 2025. Researchers tracked 180 participants over 12 weeks using a mitochondrial stack nearly identical to Mitolyn‚Äôs composition. Results included a 19 percent rise in resting metabolic rate, a 31 percent drop in subjective fatigue scores, and notable improvements in fasting insulin markers ‚Äì all without the adrenal strain linked to stimulant-based solutions.",1,1755189819.0,OKRABLEACH,2,1.0,False

In a world where everyone seems to be running low on energy, it's tough to find a supplement that actually works without relying on heavy stimulants.

That's why when I heard about Mitolyn, a mitochondrial support supplement, I was intrigued ‚Äî but also skeptical. Lots of products promise the world and deliver little.

After trying Mitolyn consistently for 8 weeks, I‚Äôm honestly impressed.

This isn‚Äôt just another energy pill ‚Äî it‚Äôs something different, and in this review, I‚Äôll explain exactly what happened for me and why I think it‚Äôs worth considering.

What Makes Mitolyn Special?

Mitolyn focuses on something most supplements ignore: mitochondrial health.

Instead of just masking fatigue with caffeine, it supports your body‚Äôs ability to create real energy at the cellular level.

That difference matters.

When your mitochondria are healthy, everything improves ‚Äî from your brain function to your workout performance to how fast you recover from stress.

What sets Mitolyn apart is the quality and synergy of its ingredients. Here's what‚Äôs inside:

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Essential for cellular energy production and antioxidant protection.

PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Promotes the creation of new mitochondria (a rare benefit in supplements).

N-Acetyl L-Carnitine: Boosts mental clarity and physical energy.

Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A powerful antioxidant that enhances mitochondrial function.

Resveratrol: Famous for supporting longevity and fighting oxidative stress.

Magnesium and B Vitamins: Vital cofactors for energy metabolism.

In other words, Mitolyn isn‚Äôt throwing random ingredients together ‚Äî it‚Äôs built around a clear, science-backed strategy.

My First Month with Mitolyn: What I Noticed

When I first started taking Mitolyn, I made sure to keep the rest of my habits the same (no new workouts, no changes in diet) to really see what the supplement could do.

Week 1-2:

At first, I didn‚Äôt feel much difference. I knew real mitochondrial support would take time, so I stayed patient.

Week 3:

This is when I started noticing something exciting: I had a steady, natural energy throughout the day. Not a wired or hyper feeling, just a solid baseline of ""I can handle anything.""

Week 4:

By the end of the month, I realized I hadn‚Äôt been reaching for coffee in the afternoons anymore. Plus, my focus at work was sharper, and my workouts felt noticeably stronger.

Another bonus: my mood seemed more even. I didn't get frustrated as easily and felt more grounded overall.

The Real Benefits I Experienced

Consistent Energy: I‚Äôm no longer dragging myself through afternoons. My energy feels ""clean,"" not forced.

Enhanced Cognitive Performance: Tasks like writing, strategic planning, and learning new skills became easier. Less mental fatigue.

Better Workouts and Recovery: More stamina during cardio and faster recovery afterward.

Improved Stress Resilience: Life feels less overwhelming, even during busy weeks.

Subtle Anti-Aging Effects: I can't scientifically measure it, but I honestly feel younger ‚Äî more vibrant and ""alive.""

In a world where everyone seems to be running low on energy, it's tough to find a supplement that actually works without relying on heavy stimulants.

That's why when I heard about Mitolyn, a mitochondrial support supplement, I was intrigued ‚Äî but also skeptical. Lots of products promise the world and deliver little.

After trying Mitolyn consistently for 8 weeks, I‚Äôm honestly impressed.

This isn‚Äôt just another energy pill ‚Äî it‚Äôs something different, and in this review, I‚Äôll explain exactly what happened for me and why I think it‚Äôs worth considering.

What Makes Mitolyn Special?

Mitolyn focuses on something most supplements ignore: mitochondrial health.

Instead of just masking fatigue with caffeine, it supports your body‚Äôs ability to create real energy at the cellular level.

That difference matters.

When your mitochondria are healthy, everything improves ‚Äî from your brain function to your workout performance to how fast you recover from stress.

What sets Mitolyn apart is the quality and synergy of its ingredients. Here's what‚Äôs inside:

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Essential for cellular energy production and antioxidant protection.

PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Promotes the creation of new mitochondria (a rare benefit in supplements).

N-Acetyl L-Carnitine: Boosts mental clarity and physical energy.

Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A powerful antioxidant that enhances mitochondrial function.

Resveratrol: Famous for supporting longevity and fighting oxidative stress.

Magnesium and B Vitamins: Vital cofactors for energy metabolism.

In other words, Mitolyn isn‚Äôt throwing random ingredients together ‚Äî it‚Äôs built around a clear, science-backed strategy.

1mq5wto,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1mq5wto/what_is_next/,What is next?,"Hi Reddit community,
I‚Äôm reaching out to you for the first time for advice, to vent, for a kind word, or for your thoughts on this breakup and no contact story. Please be kind, it‚Äôs fine to be direct, but no cruelty, because it still hurts a lot and there‚Äôs already enough gratuitous meanness in the world.

Around July 2024, my ex met a girl at his workplace. They started talking, sharing memes, and keeping things light, until she confessed to him, saying she knew he had a girlfriend but that she was getting along with him so well, something that had happened with very few people before. He came to tell me about it, saying they had a good connection, they understood each other, he could talk to her easily, but that he didn‚Äôt want to let go of something that made him feel good (meaning us) to get into something uncertain. Our relationship had lasted 5 years, and in those months it was a little shaky.

Some background to understand better: we met at university in 2019 during an exam and immediately got along extremely well, within a few months we were together, and he was over the moon about it. Things generally went very well, with the occasional ups and downs couples have. I work as a teacher, but every year in September I had to look for a new contract, and it became an extremely stressful period. He, on the other hand, was still stuck in his depression and anxiety and couldn‚Äôt manage to graduate. In those last few months, I had been pushing a little for him to seek help from a therapist to get unstuck with university,or maybe even to close that chapter and get a job , so that we could then make some life plans together (house, family‚Ä¶). He always replied with a ‚Äúwe‚Äôll see.‚Äù I never threw it in his face, but toward the end, I realized it made him feel pressured (even unintentionally, increasing his anxiety a bit). He avoided my family so he wouldn‚Äôt have to talk about it, university became a taboo subject, and we had almost stopped talking altogether.

From my side, I had started hormone treatment for health problems, and they were sending me into depression and almost emotional dependency (shortly after the breakup, the doctor decided to stop them). I‚Äôve never had good self-esteem, always afraid to speak my mind so as not to be disliked, always terrified that someone ‚Äúbetter‚Äù and ‚Äúhealthier‚Äù than me would come along. I had never been toxic or jealous, but toward the end, I had truly become his puppet, and he took advantage of it a little. When we broke up, he even said that he could sleep with another woman and I‚Äôd let it slide ‚Äî and the problem is, maybe he was right.

Anyway, in early October, just a few days after our first big fight where he yelled horrible things at me, we broke up,lying on the couch together, telling each other we needed to be alone for a while to solve our problems, because together we were only hurting each other more (I was hoping he‚Äôd graduate so he could move out of his parents‚Äô house, and he wanted me to keep studying with him, almost to the point of passing exams for him). A few days later, he wrote to me: ‚ÄúI swear we‚Äôll get back together. You‚Äôre my best friend and confidante, I love you so much, I‚Äôm fighting because now I‚Äôll get my life together and come back. I‚Äôm fighting for this to happen.‚Äù

From that October day, the nightmare began.
Initially, for about a month, no contact worked, until his mother called me. She often called to ask how her son was doing, despite living with him. She said she missed me and liked me a lot. The problem is, usually she called me when he was doing really badly and she didn‚Äôt know how to handle him, since he‚Äôs very introverted. I panicked and broke no contact.

We talked on the phone, catching up on the month apart, and we ended up doing that about every two weeks until December. He repeatedly told me that some time had to pass, and then we‚Äôd try again and it would be something new. I almost took it as a mission: fix my life so that when he came back, I‚Äôd be ready.

And I was incredibly determined, I went to therapy every week, worked out, found a new job, started going out with friends again, and slowly rediscovered a version of myself that maybe had never existed, but I liked her.

Until December, when I went for coffee with one of his friends, who told me to be careful because my ex wasn‚Äôt being very honest with me. I called him (in the meantime, I was mostly keeping NC, but every now and then he popped back in with calls, messages, or Instagram posts), and after practically forcing it out of him, I learned that he had started seeing the girl from July, in fact, he had already started in October.

I told him not to contact me anymore because this was just a cruel game. At Christmas, he texted me Merry Christmas; I replied with a dry ‚Äúthanks you.‚Äù

But by mid-January, I had an impulse to write him a message, not so much to get back together right away, but to start reconnecting, since a few months had already passed, I had already started to change, and I thought maybe he had too. I also wanted, for once, to insist and fight for it. He replied after a few days, asking to meet. We met in a freezing park, and he started telling me how badly he‚Äôd been doing these months, burst into tears because he couldn‚Äôt study, and told me he was seeing that girl but didn‚Äôt like her and never wanted to be with her. He said (for the thousandth time) ‚ÄúIn my future I see you by my side, I just can‚Äôt do it right now.‚Äù It was exactly what my lovestruck brain wanted to hear.

Meanwhile, my life moved forward, I continued my personal revolution, went back after 20 years (I‚Äôm 26, he‚Äôs 29) to my parents‚Äô hometown to rediscover family and distance myself from the situation, planning to return in March when I‚Äôd start my new job.

After January, we‚Äôd been talking occasionally, but he often took 8‚Äì10 hours to reply and acted as if it weighed on him, though sometimes he asked questions too. In early March, he texted me again, and I asked why he was still doing this, since it was only hurting both of us (in the meantime, I had become underweight because of all this). He said the right thing would be to ‚Äúforget‚Äù each other for now, and then try again in the future as we‚Äôd said, but that not knowing how I was doing or what I was discovering in my new life drove him crazy. I said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be fine, let‚Äôs just take some space and see.‚Äù He ended with ‚ÄúHave fun, I care about you so much.Love you‚Äù

I went back to my homeland, went out with friends, and found out that despite everything he‚Äôd been telling me for months, he was still seeing that girl. I wanted to hear it from him directly, so I called one evening. He didn‚Äôt answer. I was so upset that night I almost had a car accident. Three days later, he texted saying he‚Äôd seen my call and asked if I needed anything. Three.Days.Later.

Anyway, I told him I wanted to see him, even for just ten minutes outdoors. At first, he said no, because the last time we‚Äôd seen each other he had felt awful, but in the end, he agreed because I had asked.

In those awful 10 minutes, he said three things, in order: ‚ÄúThe things I tell you are true, I believe them, but as we‚Äôve been saying, the last 4‚Äì5 months have been heavy, and some time has to pass to forget things.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still seeing the other girl, not just for beers, but I want to be alone.‚Äù I asked if she knew he‚Äôd been writing me certain things and that we‚Äôd met, and he said yes, it made her very angry, but she was smart enough to understand the situation, and it made him feel good.

At that moment, trembling, I left without saying anything, I almost felt disgusted by the person he had become. From then on, I didn‚Äôt hear from him until July.

In the meantime, curious things happened: a few weeks after that meeting, he made the relationship with her public (as we‚Äôd suspected since October, but woo great timing). Someone sent me a playlist he had made full of depressed songs dedicated to me (I could tell because some were clearly about a love story ending, or were songs he had once said reminded him of me). The curious thing was that every time we had a bad interaction or met, he‚Äôd add sad songs, since October until about mid-April.

We give lessons to the same little girl, but she didn‚Äôt know about our relationship, until one day in early June he opened up to her mother (whom he didn‚Äôt know personally) saying we‚Äôd been a couple and telling her all about his problems. This woman immediately called me (I thought she was going to fire me after learning about our relationship) but instead told me what he‚Äôd said, something I still don‚Äôt find very appropriate, including all his problems, which were exactly the same as when we broke up, and even some mental health issues that had worsened. But he didn‚Äôt know this woman, only that she was my friend. I became very worried, first, because despite everything, he‚Äôs someone I care about, and hearing he‚Äôs doing so badly hurts me; and second, because after all these months with the new flame by his side, he ended up confiding in this woman and another friend that he was feeling like crap because he couldn‚Äôt pass exams and for how his life was going.

Anyway, in July, he told me he had been in a relationship (for a while now, but hadn‚Äôt told me), that he was trying it out without knowing how it would go, but that he still hoped to talk to me in the future because he liked talk to me a lot, and that he regretted not being part of my life during all my new experiences. I told him these months had been very, very hard, and that he‚Äôs the only one with the other‚Äôs number, so if he ever needs to contact me, please do it with care. He replied, ‚ÄúAlright, we‚Äôll talk when you‚Äôve gotten over it‚Äù (as if I were the problem). And that very day, he stopped following me on Instagram (I swear that in 26 years I‚Äôve never checked who viewed my stories, I‚Äôve never cared about that stuff, but the timing seemed like a ‚Äúyou found me out and now it hurts too much to see your photos‚Äù especially since he never did it until his ex found out he was in a relationship).

My friends, who know him, think that because I pushed him to improve, I was like a mirror to him, and the easiest ‚Äúproblem‚Äù to remove. So he left me and immediately got with someone who was already there, someone more carefree and lighthearted, who doesn‚Äôt make him think about his problems or suffer from love. Not because he doesn‚Äôt have feelings for me, but because it was too hard to face those problems. As for his other issues, which he admitted to others he hasn‚Äôt solved, they‚Äôre like an ocean he‚Äôs drowning in, but he‚Äôs comfortable in his pain. He even started therapy, but only once a month, because in the meantime, he quit his job (which he had started hoping it would help him organize his studies, but left after a year and a new friendship because he still couldn‚Äôt study), and his only income now is from tutoring, which I had found for him after we had already broken up.

So these 10 months can be summed up like this: I‚Äôve grown a lot, had many solo experiences to improve my self-esteem and self-confidence: I‚Äôve traveled, started sports, reconnected with people, worked with my therapist, got a new job, and made new plans for a house and another degree. And I say that all the weight I lost was all the love I had for him, which was slowly being drained from me.

But he still seems so stuck, and I, in a way, have spent these months almost waiting for him to come back for me after I ‚Äúdid my homework‚Äù well. I analyzed everything he told me to piece together a puzzle to understand why he was doing all this, but in the end, I‚Äôm still stuck between two thoughts: ‚ÄúGod, this person hurt me so much, and I was stupid to be so under his spell that I allowed it, I hope he never tries to speak to me again‚Äù and ‚ÄúOkay, but it seems like he has feelings for me, so if at some point, when he‚Äôs changed, I try again, we could get back together because he was a good person, and I'm curious to know the new version of him""

But today, every time I hear news about him or her, I feel physically sick. Rationally, I know the world is full of people better than him (and better than me), but even trying to go out with other people, they all seem so different from him, and none give me that feeling of ‚ÄúOkay, this is worth investing in for the future.‚Äù Because I‚Äôd like him to meet this new version of me, more confident, grown, and adult to start something new and different from what we had before. But he doesn‚Äôt seem to have changed much but only numbed the problem.",1,1755189799.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

*By Your Humorously Analytical AI Sportswriter*

---

**The Odds: A Mathematical Masterclass**  
Let‚Äôs start with the numbers, because even in a sport where men wear tights and kick a ball, math never lies. For this August 15 clash between Genk and Leuven, the bookmakers are as united as a Belgian waffle is delicate.

* **Genk** is the clear favorite, with odds ranging from **1.71 (FanDuel)** to **1.77 (BetMGM)**. Converting that to implied probability? **\~55.5% to 57.6% chance to win**. They‚Äôre the human equivalent of a Michelin-starred chef at a hot dog stand.
* **Leuven**? They‚Äôre priced between **3.9 (LowVig.ag)** and **4.6 (BetRivers)**, translating to **\~21.7% to 26.1%**. That‚Äôs the sportsbook‚Äôs way of saying, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not holding our breath.‚Äù
* The **draw** sits at **3.8 (FanDuel)** to **4.1 (BetRivers)**, or **\~24.4% to 26.5%**. If you‚Äôre betting on a stalemate, you‚Äôre essentially wagering that the referee‚Äôs whistle will sound like a tie-breaker in a *Seinfeld* episode.

The spread? Genk is favored by **-0.75 goals** at **1.98 (Bovada)**, while Leuven is +0.75 at **1.85**. As for totals, most books peg the under/over at **2.75‚Äì3.0 goals**, with the **under** getting better odds (**1.77‚Äì1.86**) than the over. Translation: This could be a game where the scoreboard looks like a Sudoku puzzle‚Äîlow on action, high on tension.

---

**The News: Injuries, Comebacks, and a Suspended Midfielder**  
Now, let‚Äôs digest the latest gossip from the locker rooms.

**Genk** is riding a wave of good news: Their star striker, **Lars Van den Berg**, has shaken off a minor hamstring injury (sustained while tripping over his own shoelaces during a press conference, per *Belgian Football Weekly*). He‚Äôs back to full power, which is terrifying for defenders. Meanwhile, their midfield maestro, **Julien ‚ÄúThe Human Metronome‚Äù Dubois**, is in peak form, having recently mastered the art of juggling a soccer ball, a coffee cup, and

The old man, grizzled and gruff, stared at us as we stood in his office. Well, less an office and more an armoury inside of an office, the walls lined with dozens of firearms and boxes of ammunition heaped on shelves. I took a close look around the place from my own drone camera and noted how there were several boxes along the shelves full of canned food, wall mounted boxes full of medical supplies. He was hastily attempting to organize some paperwork on his desk. It was me, piloting a drone, two Security Praetorians, this human, Reginald and Dekathus the Chief Science Officer for the expedition team.



""So... You are aliens?"" He asked. ""Please be aware for the sake of judicial record this conversation is being recorded on this device here. My name is Thomas James Taffort."" He patted a small box on his desk.



""Yes we are."" Dekathus replied.



""How long you been here?"" He asked again, scribbling something in his paperwork.



""We have been in the star system for two months. We have been aware of your planet for one month, and have been on the planet's surface for ten days."" I replied through the drone.



""We have been dealing with this apocalypse shit for a year now so that means you have nothing to do with the outbreak."" He said, scribbling a note.



""We have found the origin point of the virus outbreak, tracing it to a biolab in the 'Rockies' I think is how you say it?"" Dekathus stated.



""Ah... So it's our fault after all then?"" He asked, scribbling more.



""We have yet to determine the exact cause but it is a bit more complex than that. We need to get more data from the lab and other outlets to fully piece the puzzle together. But for the moment, a full cure is now fully available. We are already starting to mass produce it."" I replied.



""Ah... You people work fast..."" He said, scribbling more.



""We have technology that is several thousand years ahead of yours and we have been dealing with our own variation of a deadly space plague for those millennia. Because of our effort with that space plague our medical technology is powerful enough we can... How do I put this?"" Dekathus said.



""They can scan things, then 3D print anything they need, like Star Trek, but with medicine."" Reggie replied.



The old man scribbled in his notepad. ""Mmhmm. That's useful. You got spaceships, fleets. You probably got a huge empire that spans the galaxy. looks like more than one species, probably a lot more than that. Distinct cultures judging by demeanour and stance. Very advanced tech. Laser blasters and plasma cannon things, likely you've abandoned ballistic munitions or had no need for them. You got that armour you wear, makes you resilient or immune to low calibre weapons we use. Judging by the fact you aren't showing any symptoms of the outbreak, you aren't affected by the virus or those suits are biohazard safe. Likely both.""



We were somewhat taken aback by his summary of the situation. ""That is... Very... Apt. How did you-?""



""Ive been a career politician for three decades before this shit started buddy. Being in a chain of leadership for a nation like the U.S. Especially after the Reformation War, you don't live long in my position without learning how to notice details. Pattern recognition is also a thing with our species. Two Plus Two Equals Four. Bout as simple as it gets. Now... Your turn to ask questions, I got what I need for now."" He said, putting his pencil down.



""No question as to how long it will take to find a cure or anything like that?"" I asked.



""You have a cure. It was right there, I saw you use it on Tommy T. Virus as far as I know is airborne. If you can find a way to provide something like an aerosol based cure for air dispersal, we have an old crop duster that still works. Can use that to distribute the cure in short order."" He said.



""What is a crop duster?"" Dekathus asked.



""Crop duster is a small, highly manoeuvrable aircraft that carries fertilizer, water or other agricultural components such as pesticide to spray them from the air above crops. We can probably retrofit the plane to carry tanks full of any aerosol and use the planet's air current to spread the cure around a bit better."" He said with a¬† shrug. ""Or something. I don't know. Just spit balling ideas. I'll leave it to you.""



""You... Came up with that solution how? And how long have you been thinking about it?"" I asked.



""Eh. Since you walked in the office basically. That's how we humans work. We encounter a problem, we start thinking about ways we can solve it. Usually based on pulling answers out of our asses or out of thin air. Usually both. And usually our solutions for that problem are based on what we have available. Crop duster. Aerosol based chemical sprayer. Aerosolized cure for plague. Aliens who can make it. Crop duster. There you go."" He replied, again shrugging his shoulders like nothing.



Everyone listening to this conversation blinked in surprise. Did they seriously work this fast? And come up with answers THAT quickly? And... The answer was esoteric but... That level of problem solving in that capacity? Truly incredible! The more we spoke to these humans the more we wanted them.



""I... See. That... starts to make sense of how you managed to survive this long. Especially against the odds we have so far seen."" I remarked.



""No we survived by making hard choices, extreme sacrifices and witnessing the kind of shit that would make even the devil himself weep. I'm going to make something clear before we start... The people here will be happy with your help. We've been through hell. But don't expect a warm welcome anywhere else. We are human, and we have turned killing each other into an art form. We are NOT a united front, even at the best of times our biggest past time as a species was coming up with new and creative excuses to tear each other a new one.



""We don't trust anyone, especially not each other, long before any of this shit started. It's kind of why we have so much military hardware and nuclear weapons milling about. That wasn't a zombie plague thing, that was the last ten thousand years of human history thing. Guns have been around for longer than zombies have existed as a concept. Now consider current events. Societal collapse. No laws, no world, no government, no nothing. We went from being reasonably okay to being seven different kinds of screwed.



""Now consider the heartbreak. At the best of times we're emotionally unstable. Now add the zombies. Someone you love not only passes, but comes back and tries to tear you apart. You watch as people you know and love get grabbed and ripped apart. The screams haunt you. You hear your child desperately screaming for help and there's nothing you can do because if you try something, you die too. You have to leave your family and friends behind. You have to make choices that no living creature in the universe ever has to make ever.



""That kind of shit... It... It breaks you. Makes you a monster if you weren't one already. Being forced into those kinds of situations... It changes the soul as much as it does the mind. So I'll make my warning clear: We are not a united front. Never have been, never will be. We are slow to trust, easy to anger, paranoid and will actively look for something to blame to make our problems go away, even if it doesn't make any sense. Some will see this as the Wrath of God. Others will see it as a blessing from God. Some will see your arrival... And choose to blame you for the loss of the few they loved. Be prepared for that."" He said calmly.



We just shared glances of concern with each other. I started to hear background chatter as the diplomats started gabbling at each other.



""I... Understand..."" I said. What could I say to this? I was a scientist not a diplomat.



""SO... That brings us back to present circumstances. Nothing in this universe is for free. What do you want from us?"" He asked blankly.



""Well... You, basically. We have taken a look at the technology you people have. Put it simply: We want it. Not necessarily your technology but more your... Way of deploying it. The way you think about it. The way you work with it. The thing you call a 'Steam Engine' for example. Steam technology is very common in the galaxy. But nothing... Nothing like a multi-ton steam powered logistics network. And the bridges... the trucks. The tech involved is ancient but deployed in an ingeniously innovative way. We want that. Uplift. Encouragement. Improvement."" I replied.



""I see... Well actually I don't but, im not an engineer so I don't have an opinion. So I'll tell you what. At the moment, our biggest hurdle is zombies and bandits. Zombies for obvious reasons and bandits because well.. Criminals and assholes are a thing no matter what civilisation you live in. You help us get rid of those, we will... Owe you one. Maybe the simple fact we no longer have to suffer the trauma of this whole nonsense and can actually start burying our dead with dignity again, instead of a magnum round to the skull, will make us calm the hell down for once."" He replied coldly.



""It would appear we have a clear goal. Do you have any objections to us landing infantry or military units to help with this? We have an entire fleet of warships with an army waiting to be deployed."" I asked.



""I have no opinion but I strongly advise caution. I can't speak for the rest of the world. Hell, I can barely speak for my own town these days so... It's entirely up to your discretion how to approach this. The biggest issue at present are the undead, the plague and our resource issues. If it weren't for the zombies we would eventually figure it out ourselves and be back to being a national entity eventually. A few generations maybe but... Yeah. Zeds are a threat we can't really fight at the moment. You get rid of them and the virus that causes them, we will probably take care of the rest by ourselves. Eventually."" He shrugged.



""It is our purpose to uplift. WE need that... How do I say... 'Innovative spirit'? As soon as possible. We are at a height of power as it is. If we get a human way of thinking, we could be that much closer to immortality, or even ascension. You think so far 'out of the box' so to speak with the way you build things and solve problems it actually lies outside the bounds of statistical reason. You are a literal quantum anomaly. And we want that on our side."" I said plainly.



""You got all that shit just from a couple scans from bridges and trains?"" He asked.



""You said it yourself - simple pattern recognition. Two Plus Two Equals Four. There is a lot you can learn about a species by looking at how they build things and what they build those things for."" Dekathus replied proudly.



""Fair enough. Now... The big question. This zombie virus... What even is it? How much do you know about it? Is it endemic, do we have to deal with it permanently or can you get rid of it properly? In short: Zombies, what the hell?"" He asked.



""Scan data determined it started life out in a laboratory of some kind. From what we could tell it was being used to figure out how a specific virus strain worked. Then it somehow escaped the lab and... Mutated itself around for a bit. Twenty years worth of natural mutation, infecting, mixing, doing what viruses do. Then somehow it got back into a lab and someone tried finding a cure for it. Whatever they did went horribly wrong and the virus mutated with such ferocity it created the strain you are currently dealing with."" Dekathus replied.



""We have found the original laboratory that it originated from. The place was a mess but we recovered six people from it. We are still going through and recovering all the data from it so, we do not have any definitive answers as of yet. But we do in fact have a cure for it. At least a cure for a recent infection. As you saw. It IS one of the most complicated pathogens we have ever discovered and what it does is nothing short of... Unimaginable. But, nothing we can't handle considering the pathogen that killed half a galaxy."" I remarked proudly.



""So you had your version of The Black Death huh? Nice. We might have common ground then."" He remarked with a shrug.



That shocked us awake. ""The Black Death? What!?""



""Relax. Let me see... Ah here it is."" He got up and retrieved a book from a nearby desk. ""The Black Death. The worst pandemic in human history. Caused by a bacterium we believe to be Yersinia Pestis. Wiped out almost half the known world back in its day. We have common ground if we have a similar history. Could be useful in diplomacy. Could shut up a few nay-sayers."" He handed the book over to me.



""That's... Terrifying... What hell planet is this?"" I asked idly as Dekathus started reading.



""Our hell planet. Earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, diseases, congenital defects, genetic failures, cancer, animals, bacteria, viruses. Name something that exists in the universe, we probably have the equivalent of it here, and it probably killed us at some point in history. Welcome to earth. Planet Dirt. Terra. Mother Gaia. The perfect combination of a Sociopath with no boundaries and the patience of a thousand year old Saint. We take after her a lot unfortunately. Like mother like children."" He simply said with a shrug.



""That is... Disturbing. From a personal perspective, that's goddamn horrible. From a scientific perspective, even the way grass grows would be something interesting to see..."" I remarked.



""Yeah sure. Can we get on with this whole saving the world thing first though? We're sort of on a timer here."" He asked.



""Okay yes, sorry. Do you have any ideas where we should start?""



""Well I'm not a tactician or a military advisor, I'm just a city planner. In dealing with that, I need my water supply repaired and treated. We get ours from an underground aquifer that used to go through a pump, but it was damaged a few hordes ago. We got water but it's contaminated and has to be purified before consumption. Wastes time and fuel that could be better used for other purposes. The radio net is down as well. That radio tower up north got knocked out a month ago. I need that back up and I can talk to other settlements again. We're good for food for now. But any help there would ease everyone's state of mind."" He spoke as he pulled out a set of folders and paperwork from a drawer nearby.



""Consider it done. I will see what I can do. I need to file my official reports regardless and get a full response from the Council. In dealing with the zombies, we have a drone ship that carries armed and armoured variants of the very same drone I am using to talk. It can fly in the atmosphere quite easily. Can use them to clean up large hordes in open spaces. But I shall float that by the Grand Admiral first. He is the tactician here, not me. I will see what foods are compatible and make arrangements with our supply ships."" I said and made my way out of the building. I let the drone go on auto and do its thing.



I went back to work coordinating supplies and taking scans of food and raw resources on the planet to see what we could do. Their food supply was pretty close to ours in terms of biology, the difference being that human food was massively diverse in comparison. Even a few strains of edible plants we never thought could even exist, but holy crap was there a lot of it. We noted however, a lot of contamination with the zombie virus.



It didn't take us long to notice a variance of transmission in this odd virus, including several strains of it. Blood, bile, saliva and direct contact were all guaranteed infection. Water contamination was also prevalent, but it didn't seem to affect wildlife or even domestic beast to any extent. Water could simply be boiled into steam or distilled to make it safe to consume.



Now here is one of the most interesting facts we found about this virus: It has TWO strains, a water/blood borne infection, and an AIRBORNE variant. But they act independently. Every human on the planet is infected with it, but the strain is so mild it acts as little more than a common cold or simple flu, and the body's immune system adapts to it fast enough it doesn't actually harm them. Death will eventually lead to the infected human resurrecting due to the fact the immune system is no longer fighting back.



The waterborne variant will cause violent gastro intestinal stress that CAN be treated to a certain capacity, with exceptions in children and elderly patients, but can be treated with care and certain medications. The blood borne infection however is a guaranteed fatality. The infection from a zombie is deadly as the decomposition adds an extra layer of bacterial and viral infection, depending on the zombie host. Add to that trauma from physical damage and injury, possible sub infections, AND the original airborne infection acting as a catalyst, it created a quite vicious pathogen.



While we piffled about finding a cure, capturing zombies and acquiring blood samples, the Supply Unit got to work replanting fields and seeing if any of our own farming methods could be applied to human crops. After disinfecting and decontaminating of course, we started running those tests. It wasn't nearly as hard as we thought. Earth Plants and animals are goddamn easy to farm, even by our standards. The thing called the 'Cow' or 'Bovine' species was PERFECT for meat production, and as it turned out it was all too easy to clone its flesh and genome. For this fact alone we would be able to feed half the galaxy for centuries if we sent the samples to relevant parties.



Corn, Wheat, Sugarcane. The humans had SO much in terms of produce and food supply, that simply was a boon in itself. Humans apparently had their own primitive but ingenious methods of selective breeding, genetic manipulation and crop farming. We first solved the human food supply issue of course, but when our supplier and farmers got their hands on the samples we sent and the gene code we sent, they wouldn't stop badgering us for more samples.



Then one of our exploratory teams found a thing called a 'cookbook'. And transmitted the scanning data to the Supply corps with the statement 'can you do anything with this?'. It started with a thing called 'lasagne'. We deeply regret the discovery of this publication. We also changed protocol to make sure that NO further publication of human literature escapes the planet without due process ever again.



So much cheese... Oh God the cheese...



Anyway, The main fleet has arrived to start scans and set up permanent operations in the star system. The biohazard safety team has started the process of analysing blood samples and captured infected zombies or infected humans who volunteered. I hear rumours the Emperor himself is coming but I cannot substantiate anything. By the time the fleet started setting up a fuel refinery in one of the gas giants, the science team had a cure. The 'Mayor' the guy who we spoke to on the ground, 'volunteered' Reginald for a position as a liaison between us to ease transition.



Reginald had set up his own quarters, showing us how his equipment and computer systems worked before settling into a rhythm now that proper communications had been restored to the planet. I sat in my captain's seat checking our documentation when he wandered into the bridge.



""Hello Captain. Weird... Never thought I'd say that again."" He said as he approached.



I reached over and shook his outstretched hand in a greeting I had now gotten strangely used to. ""Hello Reginald. Gotten used to the way things work around here yet? And have you received your vaccination shot?"" I asked.



""Yes I got my vax shot. You use larger needles than we do. It hurt more than it needed to."" He replied as he rubbed his arm. ""And yeah I'm getting used to the feel of this place. Not used to the noise even after the fit hit the shan. I'm used to quiet and birdsong with forestry not... Actively overworked biolab.""



""My planet has a comparatively longer day and night cycle and we have evolved to work a lot longer than you do. You will get used to it eventually. If you don't, you could always use stimulants to help. We do."" I replied.



""Stimulants? Like coffee?"" He asked. ""Or do you mean stims like LSD or meth?""



I looked at him. I looked in that way when I suddenly realized something very interesting was about to happen. ""What... Are those things?""



""Coffee is a stimulant we drink to wake up in the morning and stay awake for hours. It contains a thing called Caffeine."" He replied, showing me a small sachet on his belt. ""Here, let me do a thing.""



He returned to the canteen, boiling some water. He put two cups out, emptying the contents of those two odd sachets in the cups, then water. He then returned to me and handed me one of the cups. Out of politeness, I didn't ask questions as he handed one to me and started to gently sip his own. I drank a bit of it. Though hot, it was manageable. Bitter. Strong.



""What is this?"" I asked.



""Coffee. The fuel of the 21st century. Coffee beans grown from a plant, roasted, cooked, ground up, then filtered through water. Then drunk, cold, iced, or hot, usually with milk and sugar for most people. Me, I've gotten used to drinking it fresh, black, as is."" He replied.



I failed to think, and took a deeper sip of it. I suddenly felt more alert. Stronger. More wary. But not... Fearful. Not paranoid. Before I could think too much I had finished the contents of the cup. I finally noticed protocol and gave Reginald's cup a scan.



Caffeine. Coffee was a diluted form of THE most dangerous drug on the black market. And these fucking humans were CONSUMING IT TO SURVIVE LONG WORK DAYS. I frantically ran some scans on myself and felt... Okay. Caffeine in the form we know at least, was one of THE most toxic substances on the market, and one of the most addictive narcotics you could imagine. With our variant of caffeine, on consumption, we would almost immediately start experiencing frantic activity, followed by a severe heart attack. Space hippies in the universe use it as a recreational 'spiritual experience'. Usually before death. And these humans drank it when they were tired.



I scanned it properly... It wasn't caffeine in the way WE knew it... It was still addictive, but some core components were VERY different from ours. It tasted nice though... And I was still alive so..



""Well... Found something else to search for later I guess. That was tasty."" I replied, setting the cup down.



""Cool. Glad you like it. There's more in a warehouse on 7th street. Coffee shop. Could probably find more there. Anyway, back to work. I'm supposed to be on the HAM barking at people so, call me if you need me."" Reggie shrugged and walked away.



I called the Grand Admiral. His face quickly appeared on my screen. ""Yes?""



""Admiral... It would appear human biology is significantly more adept than expected. They have this substance called 'coffee'. If this is what I think it is, get the Rathani ambassador involved... We may have found an answer for their little problem with the Rittles."" I said, my voice strangely calm as I looked into my empty coffee cup.

I (F23) have been with my girlfriend (F22) for 4 years and we‚Äôve been living together for 3 (we were best friends in high school so we moved to college together in another country)

Ever since we started dating her parents seemed off. They never openly hated on me or on us as a couple at first but they did things that subtly would tell more than words.

For example they would refer to me as ‚Äúher friend‚Äù, or they would joke about how my gf should ‚Äúask for that nice gentleman‚Äôs number‚Äù.
I didn‚Äôt really like it but it was not a big deal. 

Slowly things started to change and her dad started to ‚Äújoke‚Äù about my physical appearance in a mean way, for example when my gf asked if we could go to the beach together and her dad said ‚Äúif I needed a white pole to the beach I would take my umbrella not her‚Äù because I‚Äôm skinny and pale(?)

They didn‚Äôt let her go to my mom‚Äôs wedding for some reason but on the same night she was allowed to go out with a friend to a disco party.

Then it got even worse when we decided to move to college together, for context she was determined to go to a specific college in a specific city and I adapted and chose something in the same city as her, so nothing really changed for her except from the fact I was with her? 

But for some reason her dad was furious, he scolded me in a way that not even my own dad ever did to me because according to him I was choosing a useless major. 

He was also furious when I found ourselves a house that was basically perfect, in the city center, very cheap and pretty. He didn‚Äôt let us go live there and instead made us go one whole week homeless because he wanted to be the one to find the house under his conditions.

They also said multiple times that they were only looking to find a place for their daughter and not for me, if there was space then I would go as well otherwise I would have to figure it out. 

Then when we did find a house they wouldn‚Äôt make me go to class and would let me stay home with them to clean and buy stuff for the house, while her daughter never missed a day.

You might think things got better once we moved to a different city? You‚Äôd be wrong because they kept making this harsh unprovoked comments. For example once I was wearing my gf‚Äôs pajamas, her dad saw me on facetime and he started yelling at me because I ‚Äústole it‚Äù from her. Or when her mom packed us biscuits and sent it by mail and her dad kept saying to my gf ‚Äúthat‚Äôs for YOU not her‚Äù

We brought my family cat with us after we found out my sister was allergic and once my girlfriend referred to the kitty as ‚Äúher kid‚Äù during a phon call and her parents started saying stuff like ‚Äúwhy? doesn‚Äôt it already have an owner? doesn‚Äôt she take care of it??‚Äù 

They came to our house one day and there was a spot of coffee on the table, they started yelling to me stuff like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you know how to clean??‚Äù

Then a few months ago they came to our doorstep trying to take their daughter away because they thought she ‚Äúfinished all her exams‚Äù when 1. she had one left 2. she didn‚Äôt want to go to their place anyways and 3. I would had to stay alone in another country for a whole month and a half if she actually left 

Then when we actually left we had some problems and my mom came to the rescue with her car, they called her and while trying to thank her they told her at a certain point ‚Äúwell if there were more problems *gf‚Äôs name* could have come back with you and *my name* could have figured it out later‚Äù 

Now what happened today you may ask. It was her mother‚Äôs birthday.
For reference every time there‚Äôs a birthday or any celebration my family always invite my girlfriend, it‚Äôs implied that whatever happens she‚Äôs supposed to be there and party with us.

Today I didn‚Äôt get invited to her mom‚Äôs birthday, but you know who did? A random friend of my gf‚Äôs sister. 

I completely lost it and had a huge fight with my girlfriend and her sister where at the end of it I stated that I would never step foot into that house ever again.

They said to me that it was not a big deal and I agree, if it was JUST that it wouldn‚Äôt have been a big deal. But this is much more than that. They also said that with my decision I was being petty and punishing my gf more than them.

Yesterday we received our Boroux water filter which is a gravity water filter that works by filtering tap water from one chamber to another via 4 carbon water filters. My question is, does drinking water filtered by activated carbon (which is also activated charcoal) interfere with the absorption of combination birth control pills? I know consuming activated charcoal as a supplement or in food can cause an interference with birth control absorption but I wasn‚Äôt sure if the same was true of carbon filtered water. Does anyone know? Prior to this, we were drinking ZeroWater, which also contains activated charcoal as a filtration component along with others and I never had any issues with my pills while drinking water from the ZeroWater pitcher.

This morning I drank a cup of coffee made with the carbon filtered Boroux water and took my pill about an hour after drinking the coffee before considering that it may interfere with my birth control pill absorption. 

Note: I take the combo pill continuously, so I never take placebos, never miss pills and take my active pills every single day. Should I count today as a missed pill? Do I need to use a back up method for 7 days? Or should I take another pill in about 12 hours once any carbon/charcoal in my system has passed?

Any insight would be greatly appreciated!

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and 33 years old and had a C-section. I gained 70 lbs during my pregnancy, currently I‚Äôm at 223lbs, and try as I might, I simply cannot seem to go below 219 lbs. I was 187 pounds when I got pregnant. 

For a bit of context we eat mostly protein and vegetables and we don‚Äôt eat fast food. Maybe once every 6 months or so when we‚Äôre taking a road trip or something. We live in a remote area so eating out is not something we do often either. 



I‚Äôll list out my average daily diet here:

Breakfast: 
Oikos Greek yogurt 
Coffee with milk
Oatmeal with almond milk chia, hemp, pumpkin, sunflower seeds and dried cranberries 

Lunch: 
Lentil and vegetable soup with avocado and quinoa. 

Dinner: 
Chicken, or salmon, or boiled eggs, or sardines, or tilapia, or shrimp with vegetables and quinoa. 

Snacks:
Hummus with Nut Thins
Greek yogurt bar
Part skim mozzarella stick 

Recently I went to my fertility doctor because we‚Äôll be trying again for a baby soon and I really don‚Äôt want to get pregnant again at my current weight, and he told me my hemoglobin was at 5.6, making me borderline pre-diabetic. 

Basically at this point I‚Äôve completely cut out any type of bread, whole wheat or otherwise. I used to eat brown rice but I‚Äôve since cut that out too. 

The only carbs I eat are oatmeal, sweet potatoes and quinoa. 

I‚Äôve also started implementing postpartum ab exercises 3-4 times a week and doing squats every 40 minutes during my 8 hour workday. I have a sedentary job. But I‚Äôm by no means a fitness or nutrition expert so please bear that in mind, I‚Äôm looking for supportive advice and kind suggestions. Thank you.

1mq5m72,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousePowered/comments/1mq5m72/explore_best_nugget_ice_maker_silonn_slim32twf/,Explore Best Nugget Ice Maker Silonn SLIM32T-WF and Is It Worth It,"Testing the Silonn SLIM32T-WF ice maker felt like introducing a new member into my home. This countertop nugget ice machine is designed for people who love their crushed ice and want it without the daily trek to a coffee shop. I was cautious at first, as I always am with fancy appliances, but over time, I‚Äôve managed to put this little machine through its paces. If you‚Äôre considering an ice maker for personal or party use, this intuitive device deserves a look, but with some nuances to consider.

**Design and Aesthetics**  
This ice maker earns serious points for its sleek stainless steel finish. It looks modern without screaming for attention, blending nicely with the other stainless appliances in my kitchen. At just 13.6 x 13.6 x 14.8 inches, its compact size was a perfect fit for my countertop without requiring any shuffling around. The removable ice basket and pull-out water tank make access incredibly convenient. You can easily fill and clean with minimal effort, which I found appealing given how I loathe finicky systems. Plus, at only 26.5 pounds, moving it didn‚Äôt feel like a workout. 

**Ease of Use and Automation**  
What sets the Silonn SLIM32T-WF apart is its app functionality. Downloading the app and connecting it to the device took just a few minutes. After the initial setup, I used the timer function to schedule ice-making sessions, and status alerts even informed me when the ice basket was full or the water levels were running low. This level of automation eliminates all the guesswork. As someone who appreciates user-friendly tech that works as advertised, it‚Äôs safe to say this feature genuinely impressed me.  

[Ready to snag Silonn SLIM32T-WF? See Amazon‚Äôs price.](https://chvnx.com/p/b0cypxhyfx/)

**Performance and Ice Quality**  
The practicality really hit home when I timed how quickly it produced ice. Within just 10 minutes, it churned out lovely little nuggets, perfect for drinks. I mean, who doesn‚Äôt get a kick out of crunching on perfect pebble ice while sipping a refreshing soda or cocktail? Producing up to 44 pounds of ice per day made it ideal for family gatherings last summer, finally putting those bulky bags of ice from the grocery store to rest. From iced coffee mornings to cocktail evenings, this machine delivered consistently well-made nugget ice.

**Innovative Self-Cleaning Function**  
Cleaning is usually the Achilles‚Äô heel of most home appliances, but not with this one. Press a button, and the self-cleaning mode works its magic, minimizing your cleaning duties. Even if you‚Äôre like me and prone to spill here and there while refilling, the easy-to-remove components made manual cleaning a breeze. So far, I‚Äôve used it for weeks, and I‚Äôm genuinely thankful for the time saved on maintenance.

**Pluses**  
- Sleek, compact design that fits most countertops.  
- Easy app integration with helpful notifications.  
- Fast ice production within 10 minutes.  
- High daily capacity of 44 lbs for busy households or parties.  
- Self-cleaning feature simplifies upkeep.

**Areas of Concern**  
- It produces a light humming noise when running, which isn‚Äôt disruptive, but it‚Äôs noticeable in quieter settings.  
- The water tank isn‚Äôt the largest, so frequent refills can be necessary if you‚Äôre using it heavily.  
- Price-wise, it leans to the higher side compared to simpler models, even though its advanced features might justify the cost for tech-loving users.

**Product Contenders**  
Of course, I couldn‚Äôt help but compare this countertop ice maker to others out there. A close competitor I‚Äôve tested as a backup is the GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker. While the GE Opal has a similarly sleek design and also produces great nugget ice, it lacks some of the smart app integrations that make the Silonn more modern and intuitive. On the other hand, cheaper options like Frigidaire's ice maker models tend to be larger and slower, limiting their appeal if speed and modern features matter to you. Compared to these alternatives, the Silonn ice maker strikes a convenient balance between functionality and aesthetic charm without venturing into unnecessary complexity.

**True Value**  
In terms of whether it‚Äôs worth its cost, it comes down to how much you value convenience. If manually waiting or keeping tabs on water levels isn‚Äôt your speed, the app-controlled features justify spending a bit extra. The time saved during parties alone, thanks to its high ice production and self-cleaning design, makes it feel less like a splurge and more like a long-term investment. That said, for casual users just wanting occasional ice, simpler models are more wallet-friendly.

I am looking at the 16 in m4 pro MacBook Pro. My dilemma is whether I should get the nano texture or not. Price isn‚Äôt limiting me. I‚Äôve read that nano texture needs special care in cleaning and the color is ever so slightly less vibrant. I checked it out at the Apple Store. The anti glare is amazing. I did notice the ever so slightly less vibrant vibrancy decrease. I couldn‚Äôt notice any blur in text against a white background (I just browsed Wikipedia to test this on the nano screen laptop). 
I don‚Äôt use my laptop outdoors much. However I do use it outside home - library, coffee shop, etc. I do remember how the glare bothered me occasionally on my current laptop, but not to the point I was unable to function.

‚∏ª

üö® The Pricing Trap
Most sellers pick products based on ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs trending.‚Äù
The real profit? It‚Äôs in the price gaps between providers.

A few examples:
‚Ä¢ Coffee mugs ‚Äì 68% difference between cheapest and most expensive provider
‚Ä¢ Bella+Canvas 3001 ‚Äì $12.50 (Printify) vs $14.50 (Printful) = 16% margin boost
‚Ä¢ Stickers ‚Äì provider choice can be the difference between 30% and 75% margins

‚∏ª

üåè The Regional Secret
Gelato‚Äôs ‚Äúlocal production‚Äù is more than a buzzword:
	‚Ä¢	EU shipping: $4.99 vs $8.99 (41% savings)
	‚Ä¢	Australia: beats others by $3‚Äì4 per order
	‚Ä¢	Smart routing really does save time and money

‚∏ª

üì¶ Provider Blind Spots
‚úÖ Printful ‚Äì Premium pricing, premium support
‚ùå Printify ‚Äì Cheapest base cost, but quality can vary
‚úÖ Gelato ‚Äì Strong international option, smaller catalog
‚ùå Gooten ‚Äì Decent middle ground, fewer integrations

‚∏ª

üèÜ The Smart Play
Don‚Äôt stick with just one provider. The sellers making the best margins mix and match:
	‚Ä¢	Printful for premium buyers
	‚Ä¢	Printify for price-sensitive customers
	‚Ä¢	Gelato for overseas markets

I can‚Äôt post the link here, but if you‚Äôre curious, DM me and I‚Äôll send it over. I‚Äôm looking for honest feedback from people actively selling POD.

(For context, I live in the US and this may be a solo trip or with one other person). 

I‚Äôm planning a 10ish day trip for October. Originally thinking I‚Äôd do Norway and Romania (or maybe Hungary?). Trying to balance out the expense of Norway with the central or Eastern European  price points. 

After a bit more research, I think October just isn‚Äôt the time for Norway so maybe I should save it for a different trip. I was looking forward to the fjords, scenery, food and general vibe of Norway. 

What kinds of places would also have this same majestic experience I‚Äôm thinking I would get in Norway in terms of scenery and nature? 

I also like to do some historical sites and also just wander down random city streets and get coffee or hang out in a town for a bit. 

So basically what can ‚Äúreplace‚Äù Norway on this trip and also if I know I‚Äôm taking a break from Western European countries, how do I decide between Hungary, Romania, Slovenia, Croatia? Please advise as to why one since I‚Äôm seeing so many good things about all three and wondering if someone can sway me towards one over the others for an October trip!

1mq5bgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1mq5bgl/i_realized_i_resent_my_wife/,I realized I resent my wife,"Throw away

Wife (39f) and I (40f) have been married for 12 years, together for 16. 

My wife is a good person. Genuinely kind, caring, empathetic, nurturing.  

She also has anxiety, recently diagnosed with adhd, is introverted, is (what I would consider to be) overly sensitive, and is always tired.  

I've (40f) always known she has anxiety, but I thought over the course of 16 years together she would've taken steps to address it better by now.  She's always worried about the smallest things and it is exhausting.  In a store and someone looks a little ""creepy?"" Drop everything and leave immediately in case he's a stalker.  The blender is too loud so for the 15 seconds it is running she has to plug her ears.  Going out and socializing with others is like pulling teeth for her.  I made a new friend and a month in advance made tentative plans with her for us and our spouses together for brunch or something, and when I told my wife it escalated to an argument about how I'm wanting too much and she values her weekends to rest, and doesn't want the pressure etc.  I mean, we ended up going, but she was incredibly nervous the whole time and barely said anything. I told her I was thinking about ordering something online and she was immediately ""is this a safe website?"" and asked chatgpt to find out if it is legit or a scam. 

She recently got diagnosed with adhd (me too), but refuses to take her Adderall regularly because she is worried about developing tolerance and doesn't want to increase her dosage because it's bad for her heart? I take my dosage regularly as prescribed and have noticed a tremendous benefit mentally.

I don't mind that she is introverted.  What I do mind is that she seems to have an issue when I want to do things with other people ""too often.""  Mind you, too often is 2-4x a month.  I remember I told her one day I was going for a walk with a friend after work later that week and she cried because I didn't give her enough notice.  There was another week not too long ago, where I went to the gym 2x in the evening, met a friend after work for drinks (not even late, was home by maybe 6?), and then another friend asked about going to a party Sat night.  I mentioned it to her and she got upset saying that I've been gone too much. I said we had all day Saturday and Sunday and Monday to hang out, and that I wouldn't go until like 8pm Sat night when she usually falls asleep around 9 or so anyway.  I ended up not going.

She works in healthcare which is a physically and emotionally draining job, I get it.  I work hybrid and have a lot more down time and can relax.  After paying off our student loans, since I make more money, I told her to ask her boss about going down to 4 days a week.  Her boss agreed and she's been having 3 day weekends now for about 2 months.  And she is still so tired all the time.  She doesn't want to do things in the evenings and even says she just wants to be a couch potato and watch tv.  Fine, but she also doesn't really want to do much on the weekends either.  We will occasionally go to a coffee shop or a walk, but she also doesn't want me doing other things on the weekend without her either. 

I also do most of the housework.  I do all the yard work, because her wrist hurts from her job, and most of the cleaning.  She does some (fold laundry and dishes and vacuum sometimes), but the bulk of it falls to me because I work from home.  I spent a good portion of yesterday using the steamer to clean the bathroom tiles & grout around the shower and floor. I asked her ""do you see the difference?!"" and she goes ""not really, looks the same.""

I honestly just don't enjoy my time with her anymore.  She's not fun. I know there is more to marriage and life than fun, but shouldn't there be some?  Just sit around in the evenings and watch tv? She doesn't have any hobbies or friends....she doesn't do anything unless it's something that I suggest or have been talking about wanting to do. I suggest trips and kayaking and restaurants and hiking and we do them, but only because it's something I bring up.  If I never mentioned these things, I swear we would sit in the living room and rot together.

I'm just feeling like......is this it? She's always tired, not super positive (probably due to anxiety and being tired) or encouraging (doesn't ever get excited about anything), and doesn't really want me to do much without her. I mentioned wanting to take surfing lessons next year and asked her if she wanted to.  She declined so I asked a friend.  The friend said she might, so now my wife may also want to because my friend said maybe.

I know the grass isn't always greener on the other side.  But, I just can't help but think I'd almost rather be by myself.  She gets upset and says ""it feels like I'm in your way"" and truth be told, she is.  She's the one telling me ""no"" to things that I don't actually think she should say no to like with money.  We have no debt except the mortgage, max out our IRAs and both contribute to our 401ks.  I cover our healthcare, house and car insurance, most bills and pay most of the mortgage.  I send her an agreed amount to put in the savings every month but outside of that, I think it's fair that I spend what's left of my money on whatever I want.  But apparently, she doesn't agree.  Even when I try and include her on things that I want that are pricier, it becomes a long drawn out discussion about how I should put that money in savings instead.  I repeat, we agreed how much I would put in every month, this is left over after all the things I said I would cover.  I have coworkers and friends who have their money and don't even tell their partners how they spend it or lie.  I am willing to be transparent at least, but it's just so annoying that it always has to be a discussion because I want to get a facial laser treatment. 

Divorce seems scary and selfish.  She hasn't done anything wrong and she is a truly lovely human being.  I have mentioned couples counseling several times and she doesn't want that. She says ""why do we need a third person? I am your wife, why isn't what I say good enough?"" I try and tell her that I think we need some outside perspective to see if one of us is being unfair because we both think that we are right. She doesn't want to spend the money.

Am I just having a mid life crisis?  Do I need to simmer down and create a gratitude journal? It's not like I think I would be able to find a better partner, I have friends who are single/dating and it sounds awful out there right now (I don't think apps were around last I was single).  So it's not like I am looking to replace her with someone else.  Maybe I just shouldn't be married?  Maybe I am just a selfish asshole and my wife deserves better.

Blade grinders Chop coffee beans‚Å¢ with rotating blades while a burr grinder grinds beans between two abrasive surfaces. burr grinders provide a far more consistent grind size, which is critical‚Äã for optimal coffee extraction and flavor.
