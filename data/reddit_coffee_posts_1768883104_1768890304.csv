1qhtio0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startups_EU/comments/1qhtio0/anyone_else_doing_everything_themselves/,Anyone else doing everything themselves,"Bootstrapped EU startup, 6 months in, still solo. Yesterday I handled customer support in morning, fixed payment bug at lunch, wrote product copy in afternoon, did SEO at night, then started on next sprint. SEO Twitter acts like it's your only job. For us it's maybe 10% of what needs doing.​

The reality of early-stage solo founder:

Monday I'm developer fixing bugs. Tuesday I'm doing sales calls. Wednesday I'm customer support. Thursday I'm marketing trying to get visibility. Friday I'm back to product. SEO is critical but it competes with literally everything else that keeps business alive.​

When ""SEO experts"" say ""publish 3 posts weekly, do daily keyword research, build 50 backlinks monthly, optimize every page"" I laugh. That's 20+ hours weekly. I have maybe 3-4 hours monthly for SEO before other critical things break.​

What I've automated or outsourced:

Directory submissions were eating weekends. Found [GetMoreBacklinks service](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) that batch-submitted startup to 150+ EU business and startup directories. Cost €40, saved me 12+ hours, moved DA from 0 to 13 so landing pages could actually rank. No-brainer trade.​

Review collection runs automatically. Post-signup email sequence asks for G2/Capterra review 14 days after onboarding. If no review, one gentle follow-up. Reviews went from 2 to 24 without me manually chasing anyone. Those reviews feed into SEO and sales credibility.​

Technical monitoring alerts me to problems. Site down, broken pages, speed drops - I get Slack notification immediately. Before this I'd discover SEO-killing issues weeks later after rankings tanked. Now I fix during coffee break.​

What I still do manually (barely):

Landing page optimization happens quarterly not weekly. I rewrite value prop, update copy based on customer language, add case studies when I get them. Takes 2 hours every 3 months. ""Good enough"" beats perfect pages I never get to.​

One blog post monthly about actual customer problems. Not ""SEO content"" - genuine helpful articles answering questions prospects ask on sales calls. Takes 90 minutes, ranks better than AI-generated daily posts ever would.​

The honest trade-offs:

My SEO isn't ""optimized."" Pages could be better. Content could be more frequent. Internal linking could be strategic. But product needs building, customers need supporting, sales need closing. I do minimum viable SEO that keeps us visible without consuming time better spent on revenue-generating work.​

Monthly SEO time: \~4 hours. Results: slow steady growth, not explosive. But business is alive, pages rank for core terms, organic brings 15-20 qualified leads monthly. That's the win when you're doing everything yourself.​

If you're solo founder feeling guilty about ""not doing enough SEO"" - you're not lazy, you're realistic. Automate what you can, focus manual effort on highest-impact work, accept that adequate SEO done consistently beats perfect SEO that never happens because you're building product.",1,1768890265.0,Startups_EU,0,1.0,False
1qhtifh,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-homeless-outreach-extreme-cold-weather-9.7052324?cmp=rss,"Winnipeg homeless outreach organizations working to keep people warm during extreme cold weather | Temperatures dipped below –25°C Monday, putting community members at risk of frostbite, hypothermia","As many Winnipeggers opt to stay indoors amid extreme cold weather this week, several homeless outreach organizations are working to keep community members on the streets safe and warm. 

Temperatures dipped below –25 C on Monday, with much of the province under a yellow-level cold warning. It's forecast to get even colder throughout the week, with lows of about –35 C and the wind chill making it feel even colder, according to an Environment Canada forecast.

The extreme cold puts people at an increased risk of frostbite and hypothermia, especially if they don't have access to proper winter gear or a warm place to stay.  

Grace Bashir, the housing and shelter services lead with local non-profit 1JustCity, said about 30 community members sleep at their emergency warming centre in Osborne Village every night between Nov. 1 and March 31. 

The Just a Warm Sleep program typically runs from 8 p.m. until 8 a.m. the next day, but Bashir said they open their doors at 5 p.m. during periods of extreme cold weather.

Once inside, people can take a shower, do laundry, get essential supplies such as hygiene products and warm clothing — the shelter needs donations of thermal wear, thick socks, gloves, hats, scarves and hand warmers, Bashir noted — and have dinner and breakfast.

But the limited capacity means ""it fills up very quickly,"" Bashir said Monday.

""When we do fill up, however, we do rely on our partners, like say DCSP \[Downtown Community Safety Partnership\] or Main Street Project outreach, to be able to support our community members to get them into another safe space, another shelter,"" Bashir said, adding that bus tickets are available when alternative outreach is not.

Helen Robinson-Settee, who is on the board of End Homelessness Winnipeg, said local outreach agencies are able to access emergency funding to help people experiencing homelessness during extreme weather alerts.  

""That support really allows them to act quickly for some short-term accommodations when needed and also to arrange transportation or other essential services during this critical period,"" she said. 

End Homelessness Winnipeg recently released its new Winter Resource Guide, information about the city's shelters, overnight warming spaces, drop-in programs, mobile outreach vans, and other community support services.

When people aren't able to find a warm place to stay, Matt Halchakar, director of operations with the Downtown Community Safety Partnership (DCSP), said his organization's teams will be patrolling the streets to help those in need. 

During the extreme weather this week, Halchakar said DCSP staff will be keeping an eye out for folks who aren't appropriately dressed for the cold or are in need of support. 

Halchakar said Winnipeggers who notice a community member who might be struggling with the conditions should call DCSP at 204-947-3277, ext. 2 — even if they're unsure. 

""I'd always say it's better safe than sorry,"" he said.  

He said their response ""varies"" depending on how people are affected by the cold. For some, that means calling 911 if frostbite or hypothermia is a factor. For others, that involves helping someone get a cup of coffee and a warm place to sleep. 

""It never hurts to call us and we'll do that check-in to make sure that they are OK and if there's anything we can do to support them,"" Halchakar said.

""We're out and about 24/7 and we'll always take that call."" ",1,1768890242.0,Winnipeg,0,1.0,False

Not for the toys. Not for the cake. For the sheer energy and confidence of someone who is allowed to climb, slide, and jump without getting side-eyed by anyone.

I found myself thinking: what if adults had this? Like, imagine taking your midlife crisis out on a foam obstacle course instead of a used sports car. Instead of yoga mats, you have monkey bars. Instead of awkward Zoom calls, you have a mini ball pit to scream into. Honestly, it seems like it could solve some of modern stress problems.

Naturally, curiosity got the better of me. I ended up scrolling through the Internet late at night. Apparently, you can get inflatable slides, modular tunnels, and climbing walls shipped in bulk.

It’s wild how something designed for tiny humans can spark such complicated adult feelings: nostalgia, envy, and an existential “what if I’d been braver as a kid?” all at once. Also, apparently it’s ergonomically impossible to drink coffee while thinking about foam ball pits and modular slides. Who knew?

Anyway, I’m now convinced there’s a secret market for adults who just want to yell WHEEE! without judgment. If you see me browsing Alibaba at 2 AM, just know it’s research. Pure research.",1,1768890105.0,Life,1,1.0,False
1qhtfq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mumbaimeetups/comments/1qhtfq3/mumbai_feels_lonely_sometimes_anyone_want_to/,Mumbai feels lonely sometimes. Anyone want to build a small friend circle?,"Hi. This is me gently stepping out of my comfort zone and putting myself out there also, I’m absolutely frightened of the scrutiny of public opinion.

I’m 25 years old, from Mumbai; an ex-introvert so never really got to make a lot of friends;

Not really into alcohol; although I don’t mind going to private events to dance all by myself amongst other people but honestly I’m one of those souls who lurk on their beds in jammies and wonder about having a real social life apart from just acquaintances and networking events/parties.

To begin with;

Mumbai is an incredible city but sadly, also strangely lonely sometimes. Everyone’s busy building careers, surviving rent, moving cities or countries, and I keep noticing how easy it is to feel invisible in a crowd. Lately I’ve been craving a small circle of people to just slow down with, talk about life, wander around the city, and feel a little less alone together.

Here’s a little info about me; in a few words:

I’m chatty once warmed up, deeply loyal, sentimental about dumb things, awkward but sincere, secretly competitive about games or sports, and very into slow living. I love phone free hangs but love the chaos of doomscrolling together, deep conversations, nature walks, sitting in parks talking about art or music, people watching, and wandering into cafés or galleries with no real agenda. I overthink, I care a little too much, I’m sarcastic and funny and occasionally pretentious in a self aware way, and I’m trying to be more present with people instead of just scrolling through life. 

Things I’d ideally love to do with friends:

Astronomy and astrology chats that accidentally turn philosophical

Beach or Park picnics!!!!!

Book store/Raddi wala visits.

Art gallery walkthroughs , cafe hops and museums visits are always a big YESSS (even Nehru planetarium visits are a big W)

Badminton sometimes (without a net, in a park, but still very competitive)

Getting coffee, matcha, frappuccino or even chai, together.

Fine dining sometimes, simple food other times

Shopping or just thrifting together; (I work in fashion so let me style you or vice versa for the fun of it.)

Personal growth chats (not therapy, just listening and sharing)

Slow wandering around the city

Pop culture things I love in case you’re the same kind of nerd:

Cemetryf0g and Ross on YouTube

Super into the idea of Books, essays & writing (I’m currently trying to get into Banana Yoshimoto)

Also into a lot of Movies and shows (my current comfort films are Where’d You Go Bernadette, The Farewell, Chungking Express, Everything Everywhere All At Once, Devil Wears Prada, Last Holiday)

Cartoons too (some of my favourites are: atashinchi, shinchan, one piece, bee and the puppy cat, gravity falls, kick butowski, winx club & adventure time)

Undertale, Omori, DS & Gameboy era games

I love listening to: Ana Roxanne, Mitski, Adrianne Lenker or Big Thief, Weyes Blood, Fazerdaze, Sign Crushes Motorists, Lifafa/Peter Cat Recording.

(Tumblr used to be my ex-home.)

Overanalysing fashion shows and art for no reason other than joy.

Multiverse/science talks because my brain refuses to be normal.

Like I mentioned; I work in fashion and keep my offline identity a little low key, but I promise I’m a real human with a very unserious sense of humour and a very sincere heart. I’m mostly just someone trying to build real friendships in a city that makes it weirdly hard to do that.

If a few of us vibe, I’d love to do small group hangs too. Maybe a monthly art gallery walk, a café hopping afternoon, a bookstore crawl, a museum day, a badminton in a park chaos session, or even just sitting by the sea or in a garden talking about life and the universe. Nothing intense, nothing performative. Just a soft little community of people who care. (While keeping it non profitable because the club organisers are alas looking forward to book a profit, which is quite sad)

If you need a visual, I want the kind of friend/s I could get a strawberry oat milk matcha latte with or visit Kitchen Garden by Suzette (their vegan burger is elite) or eat a dosa at Ramashray with or walk to an art gallery with while talking about existence/multiverses or just visit a cafe/supermarket near by say nothing, people watch, sip on water and leave; while still respecting each other’s views.

If any of this resonates, I’d genuinely love to hear from you.

I feel like large groups make me feel lonelier than being alone sometimes, and I’m trying to learn how to build quieter, kinder connections. (Completely platonic ones)

And to make this less awkward and more human, if you dm, please tell me:

One thing you’re currently obsessed with

A book, movie or game you love.

Your idea of a perfect slow Mumbai day.

Please feel free to send me your cafe/restaurants/bookstore recommendations in the dms

That’s it. I’m just looking forward to making friends. 

Any and all suggestions are appreciated.

Thank you.",1,1768890000.0,mumbaimeetups,1,1.0,False
1qhtezj,https://i.redd.it/34gbgva83geg1.png,Through the Wall of the Bedroom,"This happened last week. I put the main points in chat and was asked to post it.

I woke up early Wednesday morning, gulped some coffee, and started recapitulating the day before.  We recently had a death in the family, and I've been making it a point to recap each day as best I could, and the prior day was loaded.

I was sitting with my legs crossed and my back against the bed, eye mask on, eyes open.  During the recap, I had good control, targeted specific events without skipping around much, and made an effort to silence my dialogue.  

Halfway through the day's recap, I found myself interacting by doing head sweeps and intensely staring at a flat pink/black puff.  I remember staring at it hard with each head sweep, my gaze was energizing it, realizing I was using a lot doing this, and that I needed to get it right or else it'd be a waste.  There was a constant loud whooshing noise.  

In the bottom right corner of my field of vision, a yellow thick outline of a square with diagonal black lines through the color appeared.  When I saw the square, I said out loud, ""Let's go!"" Shortly after, I was sliding forward across the carpet in the room and through the wall.

After going through the wall of my room, I was flying through space, passing what appeared to be galaxies.  I was excited to report back on the experience, realizing I was thinking too much; I intended to be silent. I knew I was intending in the second attention.  When I felt uncomfortable, I intended to remain calm.  I was sitting on something and being taken through the universe, and I couldn't see what it was.  I remember wishing I learned more about astronomy so I could identify what I was seeing.  Then I started to feel some fear and was aware of a transition.  All of this felt extremely real. I was thinking and talking clearly throughout the flight.

  
\*\*Marking this as a spoiler because it might be triggering - Dream & Death stuff\*\*

>!I found myself on a world similar to ours, staring at a sun that was more yellow.  Then I was with my wife (it sounded like her, I don't remember what people there looked like), and we were going through my dad's stuff at his place; he was gone there as well.  Instead of a residential home, it was an apartment off a main street. I started helping and got sucked into what was happening there.  My wife and I went to a hotel for the night. I recall the trip there, using the restroom, and going back to his place.  We were making breakfast plans, then I realized and remembered where I came from.  I wondered what would happen to me if I didn’t go back.  I remembered Carlos's story and got scared that I couldn't return because I'd been interacting in this place so intensely.  I thought to or wrote 'home' on my right hand between my thumb and index finger.  I tried to come back and couldn't, then got distracted and forgot again.!<

When I remembered again, I sat down with my back against the wall, and did head sweeps, and intended to come back.  After a short while, I was back in my room, still sitting upright in a sweat, eyes open, gazing at blue splotches floating in front of me.  Looked at my hands, checked the time (35 minutes), took a few minutes to collect myself, realizing I missed my wife from over there, it sounded and acted like her.  Then I dumped my notes in the chat.

After I wrote the main points.  I did my daily passes and sat to gaze.  During passes, anytime I stopped to think about what had happened, the room would 'pop' loudly; it happened at least three times.  I felt it was important to put myself back together after what just happened. The popping isn't new, but it was more intense than usual.  The rest of the day, I was in a daze. It took me until four or five in the afternoon to wake up.

I really feel that I could have stayed there if I wanted to.  I've had experiences similar to this, but never so pointed and related to what was happening here in my life.",1,1768889933.0,castaneda,0,1.0,False

1qhtcpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1qhtcpu/2_year_update_of_leaving_the_church/,2 Year Update of Leaving the Church,"Just over 2 years ago, i made a post about telling my wife that i no longer beleived in the church. At the time it was very difficult for us. My beliefs had seemingly changed overnight and my wife was understandably upset and took it quite hard. I tried my best to be reasonable, and respect her beliefs. We had times where she cried about how i made the decision to destroy her eternal family and that it's not fair for me to take that. Every few months, she would ask if we would ever go back to the temple together. 

In time, I slowly took more steps like not wearing garments and drinking coffee at work. My wife came to accept the new me but for well over a year, religion just became a taboo topic that we avoided. Eventually, she started to hear my complaints and concerns. She noticed things that were frustrating her and for about 6 months, we didn't attend church at all (which she felt quite guilty about). About a year ago, we moved and attended church in the new branch we moved into. She was uncomfortable the whole time and we B-lined out in the end. In the future, when the branch president or missionaries would visit, i would talk with them and she would hide in our room. The internal battle she was having was a real struggle.

A few months ago, she told me ""I don't know if there is 1 true church. I don't know if i believe everything about mormonism is wrong like you, but i don't think it's the only truth. That wouldn't make sense."" This opened up the chance for us to really talk together in serious depth about what truly killed my testimony and why certain topics are so problematic to me. It was a really good conversation. 

Earlier this month, my wife went out with her friends for a girls night out to celebrate her Birthday. Her friends brought her shots and she decided ""what the hell. Why not?"" And got wasted. She called me upset and asked if she was going to hell and I told her ""no. And i'm proud of you for going out and having a save place to explore. Don't drive and get home safe tonight."" Over the next day, i broke down the real history of the word of wisdom. We also talked about the nature of God and weather this stuff would truly matter to a real loving father in heaven.

I'm pleased to say that last night, my wife and i put down a tablecloth, candles, and flowers, and drank a bottle of white wine over a home cooked meal. We followed it up with some THC gummies, watched the Dungeons and Dragons movie and just talked and relaxed. We've never been closer together in our marriage, and we are learning to communicate so much better. 

Not every faith journey ends with 2 people being happier together and walking away hand-in-hand, but i'm happy to share 1 success story.

Thanks to this community for being such a helpful place for me when i felt alone over the last while.

1qhtb8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityV/comments/1qhtb8l/survivor_idea_the_karen/,Survivor Idea: The Karen,"Class: Containment

Info: Age is 25, likes speaking to the manager and free stuff and dislikes other peoples happiness and not getting her way. the Karen is blonde and has a short haircut. Full name is Klarenceren “Karen” Bailey

Appearance: Karen wears a gray jacket with a pink shirt under it and a blue skirt and black short heels similar to Helena’s, she also has a black purse, long pink nails, and sunglasses on her head (not on her eyes, on her forehead)

Backstory: Karen had always gotten her way through intimidation and bullying. Though it wasn’t always this way, named Klarenceren by her parents to be more “unique”, she was bullied for her name and she eventually legally changed it to Karen since that was her nickname. Karen became evil and mean with a heart 3 sizes too small due to her life and being bullied, she found out a girl with a wheelchair (not Galatea) was invited to the manor so Karen beat the shit out of her with her own wheelchair and stole the invitation, and came to the manor wanting its money to give herself a better life.

Favorite food: Coffee

Birthday: August 2nd

Way of death: At the broken wall in the sacred heart hospital buildings 2nd floor, Karen hallucinates Melly as Queen Bee, and is terrified and as she backs away from Melly who’s trying to calm her down she accidentally falls to her death.

Description in shop: Karen had always gotten her way through bullying and intimidation. Though, it had not always been this way. Now that she’s here she will make sure she is victorious at any cost.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Traits:

Purse smack: The Karen can quickly spin and smack the hunter with her purse to knock them back. Consumes durability: 20%, can be used for harassing.

Purse Smack 2nd effect: Due to the lightweight of her purse, Karen can use her ability faster and more often then other survivors. However spinning too much can make her dizzy and make her run into different directions similar to a hunter when a survivor is struggling on balloons

Hateful: The Karen hates others with a burning passion and can’t stand being around anyone else, when decoding with another survivor both have their decoding speed decreased by 15%, The Karen also rescues other survivors 60% slower.

Is Evil: The Karen is evil, and is willing to take from others to earn victory, The Karen can intimidate other survivors into giving her items from chests, indicating the nearest cipher machine to her, (does not include a cipher machine that is being decoded by that survivor), and can push survivors off of vaults and pallets causing them to immediately vault to the other side, be stunned for 0.3 seconds, and Karen is able to vault immediately.

Is Evil 2nd effect: The Karen is evil so her and the Antiquarian are rivals, pushing speed is increased by 10% when pushing the Antiquarian, and when in a 30 meter radius of each other both constantly indicate eachother to themselves (Anti and Karen can constantly see eachother when in a 30 meter radius)

Nails: the Karen’s long nails make some things harder but something’s easier, decoding speed is decreased by 10% and the scope of a calibration success is decreased by 40%, but struggling speed is increased by 10% and pallet slamming is increased by 20%

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Deductions:

1qhtatk,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1qhtatk/productivity_impact/,Productivity impact,"Hello current and ex-zynners

Started zyns to quick weekend party vaping which ended up leading to daily habit to use it for performance at work

I typically used 4pouches at 6mg per day (24mg) l use to function plus 400mg of coffee. Cannot explain the super saiyyan productivity. Would also take a 10 mg weed edible at night to sleep and repeat the cycle

 

I have now cut out alcohol and weed completely and reduced my zyns to 4 pouches at 3mg (12mg) and am drinking same amount of coffee

I feel my productivity or tolerance in my corporate job waning. I am tapering to 3 pouches at 3mg (9mg) this week. Goal is to slowly quit which Ive been successful so far…am also working out twice a day to help fight cravings 

Any suggestions on how to maintain focus for work?

1qht9a4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1qht9a4/cc_moka/,C&C Moka 😁☕,"Here it is! My recipe for Cinnamon and Cardamom Moka Pot Coffee:

* A full funnel of beans, these were roasted by the Abbey Monks nearby. Unfortunately, I ran out of 100% Arabica. I generally don't trust blends, but the Monks here make excellent coffee, and these beans smell amazing.
* A pinch of salt
* A piece of cinnamon, about the size of a thumbnail works best.
* 2 Cardamom pods, I used two instead of one because I wanted the minty note to be a bit more apparent.

Grind the beans using your coffee grinder. The spices should be ground separately using a mortar & pestle or a spice grinder. Never use your coffee grinder for anything other than coffee.

It should look roughly like this. I went for a slightly coarser grind this time to balance the strength:

[The biggest chunks here are from the cinnamon though](https://preview.redd.it/raxadq8mxfeg1.jpg?width=1728&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44ec822a493e1c0acc5a55f365d02c853b443e6b)

This wasn't my best brew, it didn't foam this time. Honestly, controlling the heat while trying to film a video was a total circus act. Haha 😆☕

I prepared a tablespoon of honey and a teaspoon of virgin coconut oil (VCO) in the cup:

As for the taste, surprisingly, the cardamom and cinnamon cancelled each other out. I barely noticed them at all, I could smell a hint of them, but the taste was all coffee.

However, the fruitiness was much stronger this time, but it was smooth. Almost like there were cherries in the cup.",2,1768889415.0,mokapot,3,1.0,False

It was creating a lot of anxiety for me, the idea of seeing myself potentially unemployed in this very difficult market.

I accepted a job with good money and conditions with an independent business. In theory it all looks great.

Then I realised one of my ex colleagues from a previous job had on LinkedIn that he had worked for them for about 5 months in the past.

Grabbed a coffee with him, and he said the boss can get pretty nasty and shouting is the go to when he doesn't like something.

I then went on to find other ex employees and they confirmed this.

So one day during church (I’m orthodox) I find out that my church has become very popular with the youth because our priest is younger, and right next to me across the aisle was a girl, and I’m not talking about just some girl, this is the first girl that made me feel something no one else had made me feel, and she was gorgeous, god put 100% into the making of her, and instantly for no reason I felt nervous and found it super hard to breath and when I looked over she was staring into my eyes and smiling, actually making eye contact. She did that throughout the whole sermon.

Then when the sermon finished I walked out with my little sister to go to the playground on the property while my parents got a coffee at the cafe and she was walking around there, then her grandma and dad came and talked to her an she walked away, then as I was about to go home she walked back to me and looked me up and down and smiled. My dumb ahh did absolutely nothing about it, nothing can describe the feeling of regret I feel.

The worse part is that every time I go to sleep she is there, and every time I daydream she is there. And I want to see her again but I feel like I might never, so I am js listening to music until the regret goes away.",1,1768889384.0,teenagers,5,0.67,False

1qht841,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qht841,Unexpected Taichung: cozy parks and comics,"The next city on my route was Taichung — a city in western Taiwan. My bf and I came there just for one night, but suddenly discovered that it’s the third-largest city in the country and still just as cozy and friendly.

After Hualien and Taipei, my boyfriend and I were a bit tired, so we only walked around our hotel area. Right away, we noticed more Europeans here, with a slightly hipster vibe. More coffee shops, fancy cafes, and an overall feeling that this is a nice place to live.

We were heading to **Painted Animation Lane** and walked along a cute but closed riverside area. While waiting at a traffic light, we randomly noticed a sign shaped like a cartoon girl from Trolls. That’s how we ended up in **Taichung Wenxue Park** — a very cozy place with a huge sacred banyan tree, bookcrossing shelves with cats, and a lovely little cafe.

On the street itself, we walked around, took photos, chatted with tourists (they felt like they were from Hong Kong or Singapore), had lunch, drank bubble tea, and then went to the **National Taiwan Museum of Comics**.

It’s basically a large park with several themed exhibitions inside historical buildings, all dedicated to comics. There’s a cafe, souvenir shops, and many beautiful trees. One tree even grew on top of an old public toilet — instead of removing it, they kept it as part of the space, and it looks surprisingly interesting.

What impressed me the most was that each building tells its own story. For example, one of them used to be a public bath where men came to socialize (and also to wash, since hygiene wasn’t great in the past — at least that’s what the description said). Another building is dedicated to a famous Taiwanese writer, and so on.

Almost everywhere there is something interactive: you can see how the art style of a popular Taiwanese animation changed over the years, create an image using stamps, or even draw your own comic. Interactivity is really a big thing in Taiwan — it’s everywhere, and I love that!

There are many spots in the complex where you can sit and read manga from the shelves (in Chinese or Japanese). There’s almost no English, but we found a few books without any text — just images. I also flipped through award-winning Taiwanese manga from recent years and once again regretted not knowing Chinese, since almost nothing is translated. If you know where to read Taiwanese manga in translation, I’d really appreciate the recommendation!

In the evening, we stopped by **Miyahara** — a pastry shop with an absolutely crazy vibe. We tried pineapple shortbread cookies and a pecan brownie. And the packaging… just wow. To end the day, we grabbed some fried chicken, hot tea, and simply hung out in the park, watching dogs, guys practicing baseball, and a kid playing a ball.

We didn’t have much time in Taichung, but even half a day was enough for me to really like it. Next time, I’ll definitely plan to stay longer!",2,1768889306.0,taiwan,0,1.0,False
1qht5vm,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NoteLong1143/comments/1qht5vm/coffes_and_cakes/,coffes and cakes,"Why should I choose a cake cafe instead of a regular bakery? 



A cake cafe usually offers a better experience than a regular bakery because it combines fresh cakes, desserts, and a cozy atmosphere. Many cake cafes specialize in custom designs, premium ingredients, and made-to-order cakes. Which means better taste and presentation. You can also enjoy coffees, pastries, and desserts. 



How important are cakes for a cafe’s branding?



Cakes play a huge role in cafe branding because they create a visual identity. Signature cakes often become the face of a cafe on social media and food delivery apps. When customers associate a cafe with a specific cake, it helps build brand recall and encourages repeat visits.

  


What type of cakes should be added to cafes ?



Cakes should offer popular options like chocolate truffle cakes, cheese cakes, velvet cakes and butter cream cakes. including eggless, vegan and sugar-free cakes. Also helps attract health-conscious customers and a wider audience.

How does it feel to be loved?There are so many questions about one thing that you might think you know all about because “I've seen what it's like to be in love in the movies” or the casual “When you know you know” But what if I don't know? How am i gonna know what it's like to be **loved** if everyone i've **loved** has said they **loved** me but acted like they didn't.**Love** could be all different kinds of things just depending on who you ask.If you ask a teenage girl they would most likely say “He so wants me he just snapped me back” or it might be a little something like “He just walked me to class and shared his airpods we are SO meant to be” but is anyone really ‘meant to be’ because people are always changing what if you can't change with them or you do change but you accidentally change to much or not enough.But you might ask an early adult whats **love** and they might say “when they give you time and effort” or “when they show that they care” might also be “when they take you out and remember the little things” those things might be true but what if he remembers my birthday but not how i like my coffee is that **love**? I've seen people ‘in love’ But they don't act the same abby loves her bf but they haven't been together for long or maybe in teen years that is long but what really is considered long for being with someone how fast or early is it to say “i love you” to someone just 3 words that aren't so simple 3 words that might mean a lot to someone but could also mean nothing to someone else those 3 words that get thrown around a lot Because there are definitely different types of love. What if you love them in a omg i love talking to you and you make my day so much better type of way and they just love you in a oh yeah you can be my flavor of the month type of way I once knew this guy that i would talk to everyday well not talk just snap and one day he got weird(freaky) and i thought dang me and him have known each other for a little and so i just went along with it but why did i do that i thought i loved him but when everyday i got less and less snaps it went from one a day to getting blocked i was a little confused because in my eyes he liked me every part of me i wasn't hurt i just couldn't wrap my head around the fact that i went along with that stuff for a guy i thought i loved but i always knew that he didn't feel the same i thought i was in love with him until i met army guy i thought i wasn't going to be heartbroken  but when i got the text that he thinks i deserve someone who could be there as much as he wants to broke me i felt my heart shater i thought i  knew everything there is to know about love because “ive seen it in the movies” but i relized that i dont know a thing about love because why do i love the boy i didnt want at first? Why do I want to talk to him all the time and want to tell him everything about me? I thought he was different then other guys and yes he is but in different ways he's never tried anything weird but he will ghost [me.so](http://me.so) is that the price i have to pay to be loved not lusted. When he tried to leave i told him “no this is our thing you leave and come back you always come back so please don't leave for good” that was stupid of me i should have let him leave because i don't want that to be our thing **i wanna love i wanna be loved i wanna be in love.**

How am i supposed to be in **love** if i once was but it ended in a way that hurt more then anything that i have ever felt. If i ever had a bad day i would go home lay in bed stay up late talking to him we would fight over stupid stuff about who needs to sleep or about tude that the other dude was giving i would give my tude because he was my dude and i loved him i would call him my loser i guess he liked that nickname so much he turned me into one so was that **love**. You could write,sing,talk, and even scream about how much you **love** someone but you could never make/change how much they **love** you they say to be **loved** is to be seen but what if you show only the acceptable parts of yourself and that's what they **love** will they change their mind once they know you fully. If you asked me what's **love** i would say”its when you think about a person everyday and you want to talk to them and when you would change your ways for someone but what do i know last april i was okay this april i'm crying  over a boy who made me **feel loved**  who **made me love** and also had **me in love**. He was the kinda boy who ruined love for me. Because he showed me that I could be loved without lust so anytime I go and 	a1qq2aw132try to find someone new I look for him in someone else and that's not possible because maybe no one's really meant to be but we might be the exception.pookie was what he would call me sometimes i always thought that nickname was a little wired but when he called me it i didn't seem to mind so could you tell i was in love. They say love makes you do dumb things that might be true but it could also turn you into that lovey dovey couple that you used to make fun of i never realized that was us until he broke my heart on a random sunday i went back and reread our old messages and realized that was a different me i always thought i wanted a relationship like my parents till i saw the truth of it all love isn't always what it seems nothing is perfect nobody's perfect everyone has their days and that doesn't define the person they are but what does reflect on that type of person is how they deal with [it.you](http://it.you) can go into a relationship as one person and come out of it as a way different person i feel like love is never a waste it might not be the right person but it can show you a couple things like you might learn how to get stronger and not let anyone give you crap you learn how to be your true self you could also learn that you can want something so much but it might never happen in the movies girls think they can change a person but sometimes you can get lost in yourself when your to focus on someone else i once knew this girl who would let people walk all over her but she had the strength to get up one day and say no and to argue back she went into a relationship weak and left strong and independent and for that i will always look up to my mother love is a concept no one fully understands so we come up with tons of different versions. Some might think love is when y'all share the same interest and when they know everything about you.But what love means to me is when you find someone and you instantly click yall dont rush thing and really get to know each other love is when you can handle them on there good and bad days because if you can't handle them on there bad days then you don't deserve to be there on the  good ones  you support them on everything they do  yall are happy for each others success and you want to wake up and see them next to you someone you love is someone you trust if you can't trust then you cannot love .love is such a deep connection that two people could feel for each other love is to be seen so if you love someone then that means you really see them the way they are the way they act who they are as a person. But love could also suck you might really love someone but sometimes love isn't always enough yall could love each other but yall could both want different things the future is a scary thing to think about for some people but when you love someone you might think in the moment that's who you wanna spend the rest of your life with but you could never make someone you love change if you really love someone you need to let them go.I once show a movie with two people they were both deeply in love with each other but she wasn't the kinda girl who wants kids or to get married but he was they met at work they are both surgeons and on their wedding day she was freaking out and needed a little push so he came out and told her they were done he **Loved** her so much he let her go. Sometimes love is so strong but there's always times where it can make you so weak. Love can make you do all types of things. It can make you weak or strong, happy or sad, a winner or a loser but whatever you do dont let you lose yourself.People say you can't love someone unless you love yourself if that's true then how are so many people in love no one truly loves themself but the thing about love is sometimes they could love the things about you that you hate love is a tricky thing       ",1,1768888737.0,u_UseInternational6844,0,1.0,False

I’m in my 30s and enjoy going to the movies. The other day , I saw 'Hamnet,' a book I loved. It was made into a movie—what a beautiful movie! The theater clapped when it ended. I believe Jessie Buckley will win Best Actress at the Oscars this year.

I love to read, explore New York City, I live in New York City and I love it, the greatest city in the world, a major fan of theatre, drinking iced coffee, bubble baths. Catching up on soap operas on Sunday mornings, I believe I'm a good person—kind and patient, yet not easily taken advantage of. Allow me to share a bit about myself: I don't have much time for socializing due to my demanding work schedule. While I do have friends and engage in activities, my work commitments often align with their free time. They are happily married with children, and I genuinely celebrate their happiness, but our lifestyles are quite different, which is why I find myself here.

I lean towards the blue side politically, so please reach out only if you share a similar viewpoint. Additionally, if you devote a lot of time to video games, I’d prefer you not to contact me. Also, if you are a massive sports fan and must watch hours of sports a week, please don’t contact me; that’s not my idea of a good time.

I’m looking to chat with folks aged 25-46 who live in the United States or Canada. Wishing everyone the best in their search!",1,1768888446.0,Needafriend,3,0.67,False
1qhsxq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Altimmune/comments/1qhsxq3/overhead_at_jpm/,Overhead at JPM,"I was in the hallway outside one of the breakout rooms at the JPM Healthcare Conference when I caught this exchange. The JPMorgan analyst had just stepped out with a well-known Big Pharma CEO.

JPM Analyst:
“Pemvidutide is coming up in almost every serious investor meeting. The weight loss is competitive, but what’s really turning heads is the liver fat reduction and muscle preservation. That combination is rare.”

CEO:
“That’s what our R&D team keeps telling me. You don’t often see an obesity asset with such a clean MASH profile and that safety margin. It’s more of a franchise than a single product.”

Analyst:
“Exactly. And Altimmune is still valued like it’s a small, single-program biotech. Strategically, it’s mispriced.”

CEO (quietly):
“Which is why we’re looking closely. A partnership would make sense… but if Phase 3 confirms this, owning it outright would be even more compelling. Assets like this don’t come along often.”

The analyst nodded.

Analyst:
“Let’s just say, if you move, you won’t be the only one interested.”

The CEO smiled, adjusted his badge, and said:
CEO:
“That’s why you move early at JPM.”

The analyst was heading toward the coffee counter, while the CEO walked briskly toward a small group who clearly looked like his senior colleagues, immediately slipping into an intense, low-voiced discussion I couldn’t make out.

After searching for days, I couldn't find anything smaller that has a similar setup and workflow to the Toddy system, which includes:

\- paper filter bags that can be closed from the top

\- the ability to hot bloom right in the brewer without needing an extra container

\- an extra filter at the bottom

\- a drain from the bottom to filter out oils without an extra step

I thought I might be able to use my Pulser brewer for this:

\- a small paper tea bag that can be closed from the top

\- a similar portion as the Toddy bucket

\- blooming directly in the brewer

\- filtering from the bottom (with layers stacked if needed)

\- controlled drainage from bottom using a valve

\- the size just fits 30g coffee, 1:10 with 300g water, which I'm looking for

I just put everything together don't have the final result yet, so far so good, hope for the best result tomorrow!

Running a café is all about community — those regular faces that make the place feel alive. But between brewing, baking, and balancing costs, keeping customers coming back can still be tough.

That’s why I built **Loyal Customer** — a simple mobile app that helps cafés set up **digital loyalty programs** without any complex systems or hardware. Just use your phone and start rewarding your customers instantly.

With Loyal Customer, you can:

* Set how many points customers earn per dollar.
* Create deals like **“Buy 2 coffees, get 1 free with 250 points.”**
* Let customers join via QR code or link — they’ll get their own digital loyalty card in their mobile wallet.
* Manage rewards, redemptions, and offers right from your phone.

No paper cards. No tech headaches. Just a clean, simple way to build loyalty and get people coming back for their daily coffee.

Chapter 1: The Sinkhole

I woke at 3:47 AM to the sound of my sister drowning.

Not real. Never real. Just the dream again, the same one I’d been having for twenty-four years. Céleste’s hands breaking the surface of dark water, reaching for help I couldn’t give.

I sat up, pushed the sheets away. My apartment was silent except for the ceiling fan’s lazy rotation and distant jazz from someone’s open window. New Orleans never really slept, just shifted into a different key after midnight.

The bottle of Bulleit on the nightstand caught the streetlight coming through my window. I’d been good lately. Three days without touching it. But 3:47 AM and Céleste’s face still behind my eyelids meant I wasn’t getting back to sleep anyway.

I was reaching for the bourbon when the building shook.

Not much. Just enough to rattle the bottle against the wood, to make the floor creak in that particular way that meant something was wrong. I’d felt earthquakes before—small ones in New York, a bad one in California during a case conference. This wasn’t quite the same. This felt like something breaking open rather than shifting.

I went to the window.

My apartment overlooked Dauphine Street, third floor of a building that had been standing since before the Civil War. The French Quarter spread out below me in its usual tangle of wrought iron and terracotta, streetlights casting everything in amber. A couple stumbled past on the sidewalk, drunk or in love or both. A cat skittered across the street.

Then I heard it. A sound like thunder rolling up from underground, sustained and wrong. The couple stopped walking. The cat bolted.

Three blocks down and one over—toward Royal Street—the ground fell away.

I couldn’t see it happen from my window, but I felt it in my chest. That pressure change you get when something massive displaces air. The streetlights flickered. Car alarms started wailing. Someone screamed.

Cop instincts, even retired ones, don’t ask permission. I was pulling on jeans and a shirt before I’d consciously decided to go look. Grabbed my jacket from the chair, checked the pocket for my old NYPD shield out of habit. It wasn’t a real badge anymore, just a memento, but sometimes people didn’t look too close.

The hallway was already filling with neighbors in various states of undress and panic. Marie-Claire from across the hall stood in her doorway, rosary clutched in both hands, lips moving in silent prayer. She was eighty-one and had lived through Hurricane Betsy, Katrina, and every storm between. I’d never seen her scared before.

“\*Quelque chose s’est réveillé\*,” she whispered as I passed. Something has awakened.

I didn’t ask what she meant. The old Creole women in the Quarter spoke in riddles and prophecy, mixing Catholicism with older things that made my mother’s generation uncomfortable. I’d learned young not to dismiss it entirely, but I’d also learned not to invite those conversations.

Outside, the humidity hit like a wall. The street was filling with people now, all moving in the same direction I was. Toward the sound. Toward whatever had just happened.

The smell hit me before I saw anything. Salt water and rot, but underneath that something else. Something that reminded me of the morgue, but older. Wronger.

I turned onto Royal Street and stopped.

Where three buildings had stood—a hotel, an antique shop, and a restaurant that served the best gumbo in the Quarter—there was now nothing. Just absence. A hole in the world maybe sixty feet across, irregular at the edges where the pavement had cracked and fallen away. Street lights illuminated the destruction in surreal detail: twisted rebar, shattered wood, the skeletal remains of the buildings’ frames jutting out at angles.

First responders were already arriving. NOPD black-and-whites, fire trucks, an ambulance. Someone had set up barriers, but they were perfunctory. People pressed against them, craning to see into the hole.

I worked my way closer, using my size and the way I carried myself. Old cop trick—move like you belong somewhere and people assume you do. A young officer tried to stop me at the inner perimeter.

“Sir, you need to—”

“Detective Renolde,” I said, flashing the shield just long enough for him to see the metal, not long enough to read the department. “Who’s got scene command?”

He hesitated, then pointed. “Sergeant Garcia, over there.”

Nicole Garcia. I’d done some consulting work for NOPD, helped close a cold case about eight months back. She’d been the primary, sharp and thorough. We’d gotten drinks after, talked shop. Nothing more, but enough that she knew my face.

She was standing at the edge of the hole with two other uniforms, all of them staring down into the dark. I came up beside her.

“Damian,” she said without looking over. “You live near here?”

“Three blocks. What are we looking at?”

“No idea. Building inspector says it’s not a sinkhole—wrong formation. Maybe a collapsed tunnel, maybe old cisterns giving way. Maybe the fucking apocalypse.”

She wasn’t joking. I looked at her face in the emergency lights—tight around the eyes, jaw clenched. Scared.

I looked into the hole.

It was deep. The emergency lights couldn’t find the bottom. Stone walls, deliberate construction. Symbols carved into the rock, worn smooth by time. And bones.

“That’s not a cistern,” I said.

“No.”

“That’s a burial chamber.”

“Yeah.”

We stood in silence, both cataloging details. Circular pattern to the collapse—too perfect to be natural. Air coming up from below that smelled wrong.

“How deep?” I asked.

“We don’t know yet. Dropped a weighted line about ten minutes ago. No bottom at fifty feet.”

I nodded slowly, trying to fit this into some framework that made sense. New Orleans was built on fill and marsh. Tunnels and cisterns turned up during construction all the time.

But this felt different.

“You should step back,” Nicole said. “This is active scene, and you’re not actually—”

“I know.” I started to turn away, then stopped. “The smell. You notice it?”

“Yeah. Fucking awful. Probably bodies down there, decomp in the heat.”

“It’s not decomp. Wrong smell.”

She looked at me then. “You worked homicide for twenty years. You know decomp.”

“I do. And that’s not it.”

I should have left it there. Gone home, let NOPD handle whatever they’d found. But something kept me staring down into that darkness.

Then I heard it. Voices.

Not loud. Not even clear. Just the suggestion of voices, layered and overlapping, speaking in rhythms that sounded almost like Creole but not quite. Like hearing a conversation through water.

One voice clearer than the others. A woman’s voice, speaking my mother’s particular dialect.

“\*Les gardiens dorment\*,” it said. The guardians sleep.

I took a step back from the edge.

“You okay?” Nicole was watching me.

“Fine. Just—long day. I’ll get out of your way.”

I turned and walked back through the crowd, keeping my pace steady, my face neutral. Old interrogation trick: never let them see you rattled. But my heart was hammering and my hands wanted to shake.

I’d heard my mother’s voice.

Not my mother. My mother was dead. Had been dead for twenty-four years, buried in St. Louis Cemetery No. 1 along with my father. Both of them murdered by Céleste in our family home in Treme, their throats cut while they slept.

Céleste who used to make me hot chocolate when I couldn’t sleep. Who taught me to read by flashlight under the covers. Who became a killer without warning or explanation.

I’d read the police reports so many times I’d memorized them. I’d been at college in Baton Rouge when it happened, came home to find the house cordoned off and my parents already at the morgue. Céleste had disappeared. The cops looked for her for six months, then the case went cold.

But I’d never heard her voice. Never heard either of them. The mind plays tricks, especially at 4 AM after bad dreams, but I knew the difference between imagination and what I’d just heard.

I made it two blocks before I had to stop and lean against a building, hands on my knees, breathing hard.

“Easy, brother. You good?”

I looked up. Tibo stood there in a Saints jersey and pajama pants, flip-flops on his feet. Forty-three years old and he still slept above the bar.

“I’m fine.”

“You don’t look fine. You look like you seen a ghost.”

Close enough. I straightened up, got my breathing under control. “Big sinkhole over on Royal. Buildings collapsed.”

“I heard. Nobody hurt?”

“Doesn’t look like it. Lucky timing.”

“Mm.” Tibo was watching me too closely, the way he’d been watching me since we were twelve. “You wanna come in? I got coffee on.”

I nodded. “Coffee sounds good.”

\-----

I walked home the long way, circling past Royal Street. The barriers were still up. Someone had brought in work lights, illuminating the crater. A team in hard hats prepared to descend on ropes.

A news van was setting up. The crawl read: HISTORIC COLLAPSE IN FRENCH QUARTER – ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCOVERY BENEATH ROYAL STREET.

The first person descended into the hole. Then the second. They disappeared into the dark, headlamps shrinking to pinpoints.

Then they came back up fast, talking into radios before their feet touched pavement. I could read the body language. Excitement or fear.

More people arrived. Officials in suits. A woman with a Tulane lanyard, talking to a man with a tablet.

The Tulane woman broke away and came toward the barriers where I stood. She was maybe late thirties, Black, with long locs and sharp eyes behind stylish glasses. She surveyed the crowd, then her gaze fixed on something behind me.

I turned to look. Marie-Claire stood there, still in her nightgown and robe, still clutching her rosary. She was staring at the hole with an expression I couldn’t read.

The Tulane woman approached her. “Excuse me, ma’am. Do you live nearby?”

Marie-Claire didn’t answer. Just kept staring.

“Ma’am? Are you alright?”

“\*Il aurait dû rester enterré\*,” Marie-Claire said softly. It should have stayed buried.

Then she turned and walked away, moving faster than I’d seen her move in years.

The Tulane woman watched her go, then made a note on her phone. When she looked up, she caught me watching her.

“You know her?” she asked.

“Neighbor. She’s old, probably confused.”

“Mm.” But she didn’t look convinced. She looked at the hole, then back at me. “You were here earlier. I saw you talking to the police.”

“Just curious. I live nearby.”

“Dr. Simone Batiste,” she said, extending a hand. “Anthropology department at Tulane. You have any knowledge of local history?”

“Not particularly.” I shook her hand briefly.

“Pity. This is—” She gestured at the hole, and I caught something in her expression. Not the academic excitement I’d expected. Something closer to dread. “This is significant. Pre-colonial construction, possibly earlier. The symbols are unlike anything in our records.”

“Sounds exciting for archaeologists.”

“It should be.” She paused. “The symbols. They’re repeated. Same patterns over and over, but I can’t—I’m not sure what they say yet. The repetition, though. That’s not decorative.” She looked back at the hole. “Someone really didn’t want this disturbed.”

I felt something cold settle in my stomach. “You can’t read them?”

“Not yet. Maybe not at all. But the way they’re carved—” She stopped, seemed to catch herself. “I’m sorry. I’m not usually this uncertain. It’s just—this feels wrong. Does that make sense?”

“The elderly woman. She spoke Louisiana Creole, yes?” Simone was watching Marie-Claire’s retreating figure. “I’ve been researching oral histories. Family stories about what’s under this city. Nothing concrete, just—fragments. Things the old families won’t talk about on record.” She turned back to me. “Marie-Claire. You said that was her name?”

I didn’t answer.

Dr. Batiste pulled out a card, handed it to me. “If she remembers anything. Or if you hear anything. I know this sounds—I’m probably overreacting. But we need to understand what we’ve found.”

I pocketed the card without looking at it. “I should go.”

“Of course. Thank you for your time, Mr.—”

“Renolde,” I said, already regretting it. “Damian Renolde.”

Something flickered across her face. Not recognition exactly. More like déjà vu.

“Renolde,” she repeated slowly. “I’ve—I think I’ve seen that name somewhere. In my research, maybe. Or—” She shook her head. “I can’t place it. How long has your family been in the city?”

“Long time.”

“Would you know—” She hesitated. “Any family stories? About what your ancestors did here?”

“We’re not historians.”

“No, I mean—” She looked frustrated with herself. “I’m sorry. I’m grasping at straws. It’s just, this feels important and I don’t know why yet.”

I nodded noncommittally and turned to go.

“Mr. Renolde?” she called after me.

I stopped but didn’t turn around.

“Be careful. Whatever was sealed down there—someone went to great lengths to keep it that way.”

\-----

I made it home as the sun cleared the buildings. I went to the window—couldn’t see the hole from here. Just tourists, shops opening, someone hosing down the sidewalk.

I set Dr. Batiste’s card on my desk, then opened the bottom drawer where I kept the old case files.

My parents’ case.

I’d studied these photos for twenty-four years. The crime scene never changed. My mother’s eyes still open. The wounds precise. And buried in the coroner’s report, the detail that had never made sense: trace evidence of salt water in her lungs.

Not enough to have drowned her. Just present.

The detective on the case had dismissed it. “Sometimes evidence is just weird, kid.”

But I’d been a detective long enough to know evidence always meant something.

I closed the file.

My phone rang. Nicole.

“Damian, it’s Nicole Garcia. You got a minute?”

“Yeah.”

“That sinkhole. The one you looked at last night.”

“What about it?”

A pause. “One of the workers who went down. He’s at Tulane Medical Center. Started acting strange about an hour ago. Violent, incoherent. They sedated him but—” Another pause. “Before they got him under control, he said something. Kept saying it over and over.”

I waited.

“He said, ‘We remember you, son of the wardens.’ In French. Perfect Louisiana Creole, which is weird because this guy is from Ohio and doesn’t speak a word of it.”

The cold was back in my stomach. “\*Fils des gardiens\*.”

“You speak it?”

“Some. My mother—” I stopped. “What does it mean to you?”

“Nothing. But the doctor who admitted him called Tulane anthropology department, and they sent someone over. That professor, Batiste. She went pale when she heard it. Asked me if we knew the worker’s family history.”

“And?”

“We don’t. But she asked for a list of all first responders at the scene. Damian—your name is on that list from this morning.”

I didn’t say anything.

“She specifically asked about you,” Nicole continued. “Wanted to know if you’d been exposed to anything from the hole. I told her no, you just looked. That’s true, right?”

“That’s true.”

“Good. Because whatever’s going on, the CDC is now involved. They’re treating this like a potential biohazard. Quarantining everyone who descended. Running tests.”

“Thanks for the heads-up,” I said.

“Damian—” She hesitated. “That professor. She said if I talked to you, I should tell you something.”

“What?”

“She said, ‘Ask him what his mother told him about the guardians.’”

The question hit like a fist to the chest. Not because I remembered something.

Because I didn’t want to.

I stood at the window, Dr. Batiste’s card in my hand, my mother’s voice echoing in my head—real or imagined, I couldn’t tell anymore.

There was something. Buried deep, from childhood. A nightmare about drowning, my mother’s hands on my face, words in Creole I’d promised to forget.

I’d kept that promise for thirty years.

If I broke it now, if I let myself remember—then everything I’d survived, everything I’d built, meant something else entirely.

I wasn’t ready for that.

My phone buzzed. A text from an unknown number:

\*“Mr. Renolde. This is Dr. Batiste. We need to talk. The situation is escalating. Please call me as soon as possible.”\*

I looked at the text for a long moment. Then I looked at the drawer where I kept the bourbon.

Then I looked at the file on my desk, at my parents’ faces in those crime scene photos, at twenty-four years of unanswered questions.

I should have stayed home.

But I’d learned a long time ago that “should have” didn’t mean much when the world decided to crack open and show you what was underneath.

I picked up my phone and called Dr. Batiste.

“This is Damian Renolde. You said we need to talk.”

“Yes. Thank you for calling. Can you come to my office? There’s something I need to show you.”

“What kind of something?”

A pause. “Your family name appears in records I’ve been researching. Historical records about—Mr. Renolde, do you know what \*Les Noyés\* are?”

The Drowned Ones.

The words came from somewhere deep. Somewhere I’d locked away.

“No,” I said.

The lie tasted like salt water.

“Come to my office,” Dr. Batiste said. “Please. This is important.”

“I’ll be there in an hour.”

I hung up and stood there in my apartment, morning light streaming through the windows.

Normal. Everything normal.

Except for the hole in the ground three blocks away, and the voices I’d heard, and the way my mother’s words from thirty years ago suddenly felt like warning instead of comfort.

I grabbed my jacket and headed for the door.

Behind me, on my desk, the case file lay open. My mother’s face in the crime scene photo, eyes still open.

That expression I’d stared at for twenty-four years, trying to read.

I’d always thought it was fear.

But I didn’t look closer. I just left, closing the door on the dead and walking out into a day that felt like the last normal morning I’d ever have.

Chapter 1: The Sinkhole

I woke at 3:47 AM to the sound of my sister drowning.

Not real. Never real. Just the dream again, the same one I’d been having for twenty-four years. Céleste’s hands breaking the surface of dark water, reaching for help I couldn’t give.

I sat up, pushed the sheets away. My apartment was silent except for the ceiling fan’s lazy rotation and distant jazz from someone’s open window. New Orleans never really slept, just shifted into a different key after midnight.

The bottle of Bulleit on the nightstand caught the streetlight coming through my window. I’d been good lately. Three days without touching it. But 3:47 AM and Céleste’s face still behind my eyelids meant I wasn’t getting back to sleep anyway.

I was reaching for the bourbon when the building shook.

Not much. Just enough to rattle the bottle against the wood, to make the floor creak in that particular way that meant something was wrong. I’d felt earthquakes before—small ones in New York, a bad one in California during a case conference. This wasn’t quite the same. This felt like something breaking open rather than shifting.

I went to the window.

My apartment overlooked Dauphine Street, third floor of a building that had been standing since before the Civil War. The French Quarter spread out below me in its usual tangle of wrought iron and terracotta, streetlights casting everything in amber. A couple stumbled past on the sidewalk, drunk or in love or both. A cat skittered across the street.

Then I heard it. A sound like thunder rolling up from underground, sustained and wrong. The couple stopped walking. The cat bolted.

Three blocks down and one over—toward Royal Street—the ground fell away.

I couldn’t see it happen from my window, but I felt it in my chest. That pressure change you get when something massive displaces air. The streetlights flickered. Car alarms started wailing. Someone screamed.

Cop instincts, even retired ones, don’t ask permission. I was pulling on jeans and a shirt before I’d consciously decided to go look. Grabbed my jacket from the chair, checked the pocket for my old NYPD shield out of habit. It wasn’t a real badge anymore, just a memento, but sometimes people didn’t look too close.

The hallway was already filling with neighbors in various states of undress and panic. Marie-Claire from across the hall stood in her doorway, rosary clutched in both hands, lips moving in silent prayer. She was eighty-one and had lived through Hurricane Betsy, Katrina, and every storm between. I’d never seen her scared before.

“\*Quelque chose s’est réveillé\*,” she whispered as I passed. Something has awakened.

I didn’t ask what she meant. The old Creole women in the Quarter spoke in riddles and prophecy, mixing Catholicism with older things that made my mother’s generation uncomfortable. I’d learned young not to dismiss it entirely, but I’d also learned not to invite those conversations.

Outside, the humidity hit like a wall. The street was filling with people now, all moving in the same direction I was. Toward the sound. Toward whatever had just happened.

The smell hit me before I saw anything. Salt water and rot, but underneath that something else. Something that reminded me of the morgue, but older. Wronger.

I turned onto Royal Street and stopped.

Where three buildings had stood—a hotel, an antique shop, and a restaurant that served the best gumbo in the Quarter—there was now nothing. Just absence. A hole in the world maybe sixty feet across, irregular at the edges where the pavement had cracked and fallen away. Street lights illuminated the destruction in surreal detail: twisted rebar, shattered wood, the skeletal remains of the buildings’ frames jutting out at angles.

First responders were already arriving. NOPD black-and-whites, fire trucks, an ambulance. Someone had set up barriers, but they were perfunctory. People pressed against them, craning to see into the hole.

I worked my way closer, using my size and the way I carried myself. Old cop trick—move like you belong somewhere and people assume you do. A young officer tried to stop me at the inner perimeter.

“Sir, you need to—”

“Detective Renolde,” I said, flashing the shield just long enough for him to see the metal, not long enough to read the department. “Who’s got scene command?”

He hesitated, then pointed. “Sergeant Garcia, over there.”

Nicole Garcia. I’d done some consulting work for NOPD, helped close a cold case about eight months back. She’d been the primary, sharp and thorough. We’d gotten drinks after, talked shop. Nothing more, but enough that she knew my face.

She was standing at the edge of the hole with two other uniforms, all of them staring down into the dark. I came up beside her.

“Damian,” she said without looking over. “You live near here?”

“Three blocks. What are we looking at?”

“No idea. Building inspector says it’s not a sinkhole—wrong formation. Maybe a collapsed tunnel, maybe old cisterns giving way. Maybe the fucking apocalypse.”

She wasn’t joking. I looked at her face in the emergency lights—tight around the eyes, jaw clenched. Scared.

I looked into the hole.

It was deep. The emergency lights couldn’t find the bottom. Stone walls, deliberate construction. Symbols carved into the rock, worn smooth by time. And bones.

“That’s not a cistern,” I said.

“No.”

“That’s a burial chamber.”

“Yeah.”

We stood in silence, both cataloging details. Circular pattern to the collapse—too perfect to be natural. Air coming up from below that smelled wrong.

“How deep?” I asked.

“We don’t know yet. Dropped a weighted line about ten minutes ago. No bottom at fifty feet.”

I nodded slowly, trying to fit this into some framework that made sense. New Orleans was built on fill and marsh. Tunnels and cisterns turned up during construction all the time.

But this felt different.

“You should step back,” Nicole said. “This is active scene, and you’re not actually—”

“I know.” I started to turn away, then stopped. “The smell. You notice it?”

“Yeah. Fucking awful. Probably bodies down there, decomp in the heat.”

“It’s not decomp. Wrong smell.”

She looked at me then. “You worked homicide for twenty years. You know decomp.”

“I do. And that’s not it.”

I should have left it there. Gone home, let NOPD handle whatever they’d found. But something kept me staring down into that darkness.

Then I heard it. Voices.

Not loud. Not even clear. Just the suggestion of voices, layered and overlapping, speaking in rhythms that sounded almost like Creole but not quite. Like hearing a conversation through water.

One voice clearer than the others. A woman’s voice, speaking my mother’s particular dialect.

“\*Les gardiens dorment\*,” it said. The guardians sleep.

I took a step back from the edge.

“You okay?” Nicole was watching me.

“Fine. Just—long day. I’ll get out of your way.”

I turned and walked back through the crowd, keeping my pace steady, my face neutral. Old interrogation trick: never let them see you rattled. But my heart was hammering and my hands wanted to shake.

I’d heard my mother’s voice.

Not my mother. My mother was dead. Had been dead for twenty-four years, buried in St. Louis Cemetery No. 1 along with my father. Both of them murdered by Céleste in our family home in Treme, their throats cut while they slept.

Céleste who used to make me hot chocolate when I couldn’t sleep. Who taught me to read by flashlight under the covers. Who became a killer without warning or explanation.

I’d read the police reports so many times I’d memorized them. I’d been at college in Baton Rouge when it happened, came home to find the house cordoned off and my parents already at the morgue. Céleste had disappeared. The cops looked for her for six months, then the case went cold.

But I’d never heard her voice. Never heard either of them. The mind plays tricks, especially at 4 AM after bad dreams, but I knew the difference between imagination and what I’d just heard.

I made it two blocks before I had to stop and lean against a building, hands on my knees, breathing hard.

“Easy, brother. You good?”

I looked up. Tibo stood there in a Saints jersey and pajama pants, flip-flops on his feet. Forty-three years old and he still slept above the bar.

“I’m fine.”

“You don’t look fine. You look like you seen a ghost.”

Close enough. I straightened up, got my breathing under control. “Big sinkhole over on Royal. Buildings collapsed.”

“I heard. Nobody hurt?”

“Doesn’t look like it. Lucky timing.”

“Mm.” Tibo was watching me too closely, the way he’d been watching me since we were twelve. “You wanna come in? I got coffee on.”

I nodded. “Coffee sounds good.”

\-----

I walked home the long way, circling past Royal Street. The barriers were still up. Someone had brought in work lights, illuminating the crater. A team in hard hats prepared to descend on ropes.

A news van was setting up. The crawl read: HISTORIC COLLAPSE IN FRENCH QUARTER – ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCOVERY BENEATH ROYAL STREET.

The first person descended into the hole. Then the second. They disappeared into the dark, headlamps shrinking to pinpoints.

Then they came back up fast, talking into radios before their feet touched pavement. I could read the body language. Excitement or fear.

More people arrived. Officials in suits. A woman with a Tulane lanyard, talking to a man with a tablet.

The Tulane woman broke away and came toward the barriers where I stood. She was maybe late thirties, Black, with long locs and sharp eyes behind stylish glasses. She surveyed the crowd, then her gaze fixed on something behind me.

I turned to look. Marie-Claire stood there, still in her nightgown and robe, still clutching her rosary. She was staring at the hole with an expression I couldn’t read.

The Tulane woman approached her. “Excuse me, ma’am. Do you live nearby?”

Marie-Claire didn’t answer. Just kept staring.

“Ma’am? Are you alright?”

“\*Il aurait dû rester enterré\*,” Marie-Claire said softly. It should have stayed buried.

Then she turned and walked away, moving faster than I’d seen her move in years.

The Tulane woman watched her go, then made a note on her phone. When she looked up, she caught me watching her.

“You know her?” she asked.

“Neighbor. She’s old, probably confused.”

“Mm.” But she didn’t look convinced. She looked at the hole, then back at me. “You were here earlier. I saw you talking to the police.”

“Just curious. I live nearby.”

“Dr. Simone Batiste,” she said, extending a hand. “Anthropology department at Tulane. You have any knowledge of local history?”

“Not particularly.” I shook her hand briefly.

“Pity. This is—” She gestured at the hole, and I caught something in her expression. Not the academic excitement I’d expected. Something closer to dread. “This is significant. Pre-colonial construction, possibly earlier. The symbols are unlike anything in our records.”

“Sounds exciting for archaeologists.”

“It should be.” She paused. “The symbols. They’re repeated. Same patterns over and over, but I can’t—I’m not sure what they say yet. The repetition, though. That’s not decorative.” She looked back at the hole. “Someone really didn’t want this disturbed.”

I felt something cold settle in my stomach. “You can’t read them?”

“Not yet. Maybe not at all. But the way they’re carved—” She stopped, seemed to catch herself. “I’m sorry. I’m not usually this uncertain. It’s just—this feels wrong. Does that make sense?”

“The elderly woman. She spoke Louisiana Creole, yes?” Simone was watching Marie-Claire’s retreating figure. “I’ve been researching oral histories. Family stories about what’s under this city. Nothing concrete, just—fragments. Things the old families won’t talk about on record.” She turned back to me. “Marie-Claire. You said that was her name?”

I didn’t answer.

Dr. Batiste pulled out a card, handed it to me. “If she remembers anything. Or if you hear anything. I know this sounds—I’m probably overreacting. But we need to understand what we’ve found.”

I pocketed the card without looking at it. “I should go.”

“Of course. Thank you for your time, Mr.—”

“Renolde,” I said, already regretting it. “Damian Renolde.”

Something flickered across her face. Not recognition exactly. More like déjà vu.

“Renolde,” she repeated slowly. “I’ve—I think I’ve seen that name somewhere. In my research, maybe. Or—” She shook her head. “I can’t place it. How long has your family been in the city?”

“Long time.”

“Would you know—” She hesitated. “Any family stories? About what your ancestors did here?”

“We’re not historians.”

“No, I mean—” She looked frustrated with herself. “I’m sorry. I’m grasping at straws. It’s just, this feels important and I don’t know why yet.”

I nodded noncommittally and turned to go.

“Mr. Renolde?” she called after me.

I stopped but didn’t turn around.

“Be careful. Whatever was sealed down there—someone went to great lengths to keep it that way.”

\-----

I made it home as the sun cleared the buildings. I went to the window—couldn’t see the hole from here. Just tourists, shops opening, someone hosing down the sidewalk.

I set Dr. Batiste’s card on my desk, then opened the bottom drawer where I kept the old case files.

My parents’ case.

I’d studied these photos for twenty-four years. The crime scene never changed. My mother’s eyes still open. The wounds precise. And buried in the coroner’s report, the detail that had never made sense: trace evidence of salt water in her lungs.

Not enough to have drowned her. Just present.

The detective on the case had dismissed it. “Sometimes evidence is just weird, kid.”

But I’d been a detective long enough to know evidence always meant something.

I closed the file.

My phone rang. Nicole.

“Damian, it’s Nicole Garcia. You got a minute?”

“Yeah.”

“That sinkhole. The one you looked at last night.”

“What about it?”

A pause. “One of the workers who went down. He’s at Tulane Medical Center. Started acting strange about an hour ago. Violent, incoherent. They sedated him but—” Another pause. “Before they got him under control, he said something. Kept saying it over and over.”

I waited.

“He said, ‘We remember you, son of the wardens.’ In French. Perfect Louisiana Creole, which is weird because this guy is from Ohio and doesn’t speak a word of it.”

The cold was back in my stomach. “\*Fils des gardiens\*.”

“You speak it?”

“Some. My mother—” I stopped. “What does it mean to you?”

“Nothing. But the doctor who admitted him called Tulane anthropology department, and they sent someone over. That professor, Batiste. She went pale when she heard it. Asked me if we knew the worker’s family history.”

“And?”

“We don’t. But she asked for a list of all first responders at the scene. Damian—your name is on that list from this morning.”

I didn’t say anything.

“She specifically asked about you,” Nicole continued. “Wanted to know if you’d been exposed to anything from the hole. I told her no, you just looked. That’s true, right?”

“That’s true.”

“Good. Because whatever’s going on, the CDC is now involved. They’re treating this like a potential biohazard. Quarantining everyone who descended. Running tests.”

“Thanks for the heads-up,” I said.

“Damian—” She hesitated. “That professor. She said if I talked to you, I should tell you something.”

“What?”

“She said, ‘Ask him what his mother told him about the guardians.’”

It was deep. The emergency lights couldn’t find the bottom. Stone walls, deliberate construction. Symbols carved into the rock, worn smooth by time. And bones.

“That’s not a cistern,” I said.

“No.”

“That’s a burial chamber.”

“Yeah.”

We stood in silence, both cataloging details. Circular pattern to the collapse—too perfect to be natural. Air coming up from below that smelled wrong.

“How deep?” I asked.

“We don’t know yet. Dropped a weighted line about ten minutes ago. No bottom at fifty feet.”

I nodded slowly, trying to fit this into some framework that made sense. New Orleans was built on fill and marsh. Tunnels and cisterns turned up during construction all the time.

But this felt different.

“You should step back,” Nicole said. “This is active scene, and you’re not actually—”

“I know.” I started to turn away, then stopped. “The smell. You notice it?”

“Yeah. Fucking awful. Probably bodies down there, decomp in the heat.”

“It’s not decomp. Wrong smell.”

She looked at me then. “You worked homicide for twenty years. You know decomp.”

“I do. And that’s not it.”

I should have left it there. Gone home, let NOPD handle whatever they’d found. But something kept me staring down into that darkness.

Then I heard it. Voices.

Not loud. Not even clear. Just the suggestion of voices, layered and overlapping, speaking in rhythms that sounded almost like Creole but not quite. Like hearing a conversation through water.

One voice clearer than the others. A woman’s voice, speaking my mother’s particular dialect.

“\*Les gardiens dorment\*,” it said. The guardians sleep.

I took a step back from the edge.

“You okay?” Nicole was watching me.

“Fine. Just—long day. I’ll get out of your way.”

I turned and walked back through the crowd, keeping my pace steady, my face neutral. Old interrogation trick: never let them see you rattled. But my heart was hammering and my hands wanted to shake.

I’d heard my mother’s voice.

Not my mother. My mother was dead. Had been dead for twenty-four years, buried in St. Louis Cemetery No. 1 along with my father. Both of them murdered by Céleste in our family home in Treme, their throats cut while they slept.

Céleste who used to make me hot chocolate when I couldn’t sleep. Who taught me to read by flashlight under the covers. Who became a killer without warning or explanation.

I’d read the police reports so many times I’d memorized them. I’d been at college in Baton Rouge when it happened, came home to find the house cordoned off and my parents already at the morgue. Céleste had disappeared. The cops looked for her for six months, then the case went cold.

But I’d never heard her voice. Never heard either of them. The mind plays tricks, especially at 4 AM after bad dreams, but I knew the difference between imagination and what I’d just heard.

I made it two blocks before I had to stop and lean against a building, hands on my knees, breathing hard.

“Easy, brother. You good?”

I looked up. Tibo stood there in a Saints jersey and pajama pants, flip-flops on his feet. Forty-three years old and he still slept above the bar.

“I’m fine.”

“You don’t look fine. You look like you seen a ghost.”

Close enough. I straightened up, got my breathing under control. “Big sinkhole over on Royal. Buildings collapsed.”

“I heard. Nobody hurt?”

“Doesn’t look like it. Lucky timing.”

“Mm.” Tibo was watching me too closely, the way he’d been watching me since we were twelve. “You wanna come in? I got coffee on.”

I nodded. “Coffee sounds good.”

\-----

I walked home the long way, circling past Royal Street. The barriers were still up. Someone had brought in work lights, illuminating the crater. A team in hard hats prepared to descend on ropes.

A news van was setting up. The crawl read: HISTORIC COLLAPSE IN FRENCH QUARTER – ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCOVERY BENEATH ROYAL STREET.

The first person descended into the hole. Then the second. They disappeared into the dark, headlamps shrinking to pinpoints.

Then they came back up fast, talking into radios before their feet touched pavement. I could read the body language. Excitement or fear.

More people arrived. Officials in suits. A woman with a Tulane lanyard, talking to a man with a tablet.

The Tulane woman broke away and came toward the barriers where I stood. She was maybe late thirties, Black, with long locs and sharp eyes behind stylish glasses. She surveyed the crowd, then her gaze fixed on something behind me.

I turned to look. Marie-Claire stood there, still in her nightgown and robe, still clutching her rosary. She was staring at the hole with an expression I couldn’t read.

The Tulane woman approached her. “Excuse me, ma’am. Do you live nearby?”

Marie-Claire didn’t answer. Just kept staring.

“Ma’am? Are you alright?”

“\*Il aurait dû rester enterré\*,” Marie-Claire said softly. It should have stayed buried.

Then she turned and walked away, moving faster than I’d seen her move in years.

The Tulane woman watched her go, then made a note on her phone. When she looked up, she caught me watching her.

“You know her?” she asked.

“Neighbor. She’s old, probably confused.”

“Mm.” But she didn’t look convinced. She looked at the hole, then back at me. “You were here earlier. I saw you talking to the police.”

“Just curious. I live nearby.”

“Dr. Simone Batiste,” she said, extending a hand. “Anthropology department at Tulane. You have any knowledge of local history?”

“Not particularly.” I shook her hand briefly.

“Pity. This is—” She gestured at the hole, and I caught something in her expression. Not the academic excitement I’d expected. Something closer to dread. “This is significant. Pre-colonial construction, possibly earlier. The symbols are unlike anything in our records.”

“Sounds exciting for archaeologists.”

“It should be.” She paused. “The symbols. They’re repeated. Same patterns over and over, but I can’t—I’m not sure what they say yet. The repetition, though. That’s not decorative.” She looked back at the hole. “Someone really didn’t want this disturbed.”

I felt something cold settle in my stomach. “You can’t read them?”

“Not yet. Maybe not at all. But the way they’re carved—” She stopped, seemed to catch herself. “I’m sorry. I’m not usually this uncertain. It’s just—this feels wrong. Does that make sense?”

“The elderly woman. She spoke Louisiana Creole, yes?” Simone was watching Marie-Claire’s retreating figure. “I’ve been researching oral histories. Family stories about what’s under this city. Nothing concrete, just—fragments. Things the old families won’t talk about on record.” She turned back to me. “Marie-Claire. You said that was her name?”

I didn’t answer.

Dr. Batiste pulled out a card, handed it to me. “If she remembers anything. Or if you hear anything. I know this sounds—I’m probably overreacting. But we need to understand what we’ve found.”

I pocketed the card without looking at it. “I should go.”

“Of course. Thank you for your time, Mr.—”

“Renolde,” I said, already regretting it. “Damian Renolde.”

Something flickered across her face. Not recognition exactly. More like déjà vu.

“Renolde,” she repeated slowly. “I’ve—I think I’ve seen that name somewhere. In my research, maybe. Or—” She shook her head. “I can’t place it. How long has your family been in the city?”

“Long time.”

“Would you know—” She hesitated. “Any family stories? About what your ancestors did here?”

“We’re not historians.”

“No, I mean—” She looked frustrated with herself. “I’m sorry. I’m grasping at straws. It’s just, this feels important and I don’t know why yet.”

I nodded noncommittally and turned to go.

“Mr. Renolde?” she called after me.

I stopped but didn’t turn around.

“Be careful. Whatever was sealed down there—someone went to great lengths to keep it that way.”

\-----

I made it home as the sun cleared the buildings. I went to the window—couldn’t see the hole from here. Just tourists, shops opening, someone hosing down the sidewalk.

I set Dr. Batiste’s card on my desk, then opened the bottom drawer where I kept the old case files.

My parents’ case.

I’d studied these photos for twenty-four years. The crime scene never changed. My mother’s eyes still open. The wounds precise. And buried in the coroner’s report, the detail that had never made sense: trace evidence of salt water in her lungs.

Not enough to have drowned her. Just present.

The detective on the case had dismissed it. “Sometimes evidence is just weird, kid.”

But I’d been a detective long enough to know evidence always meant something.

I closed the file.

My phone rang. Nicole.

“Damian, it’s Nicole Garcia. You got a minute?”

“Yeah.”

“That sinkhole. The one you looked at last night.”

“What about it?”

A pause. “One of the workers who went down. He’s at Tulane Medical Center. Started acting strange about an hour ago. Violent, incoherent. They sedated him but—” Another pause. “Before they got him under control, he said something. Kept saying it over and over.”

I waited.

“He said, ‘We remember you, son of the wardens.’ In French. Perfect Louisiana Creole, which is weird because this guy is from Ohio and doesn’t speak a word of it.”

The cold was back in my stomach. “\*Fils des gardiens\*.”

“You speak it?”

“Some. My mother—” I stopped. “What does it mean to you?”

“Nothing. But the doctor who admitted him called Tulane anthropology department, and they sent someone over. That professor, Batiste. She went pale when she heard it. Asked me if we knew the worker’s family history.”

“And?”

“We don’t. But she asked for a list of all first responders at the scene. Damian—your name is on that list from this morning.”

I didn’t say anything.

“She specifically asked about you,” Nicole continued. “Wanted to know if you’d been exposed to anything from the hole. I told her no, you just looked. That’s true, right?”

“That’s true.”

“Good. Because whatever’s going on, the CDC is now involved. They’re treating this like a potential biohazard. Quarantining everyone who descended. Running tests.”

“Thanks for the heads-up,” I said.

“Damian—” She hesitated. “That professor. She said if I talked to you, I should tell you something.”

“What?”

“She said, ‘Ask him what his mother told him about the guardians.’”

The question hit like a fist to the chest. Not because I remembered something.

Because I didn’t want to.

I stood at the window, Dr. Batiste’s card in my hand, my mother’s voice echoing in my head—real or imagined, I couldn’t tell anymore.

There was something. Buried deep, from childhood. A nightmare about drowning, my mother’s hands on my face, words in Creole I’d promised to forget.

I’d kept that promise for thirty years.

If I broke it now, if I let myself remember—then everything I’d survived, everything I’d built, meant something else entirely.

I wasn’t ready for that.

My phone buzzed. A text from an unknown number:

\*“Mr. Renolde. This is Dr. Batiste. We need to talk. The situation is escalating. Please call me as soon as possible.”\*

I looked at the text for a long moment. Then I looked at the drawer where I kept the bourbon.

Then I looked at the file on my desk, at my parents’ faces in those crime scene photos, at twenty-four years of unanswered questions.

I should have stayed home.

But I’d learned a long time ago that “should have” didn’t mean much when the world decided to crack open and show you what was underneath.

I picked up my phone and called Dr. Batiste.

“This is Damian Renolde. You said we need to talk.”

“Yes. Thank you for calling. Can you come to my office? There’s something I need to show you.”

“What kind of something?”

A pause. “Your family name appears in records I’ve been researching. Historical records about—Mr. Renolde, do you know what \*Les Noyés\* are?”

The Drowned Ones.

The words came from somewhere deep. Somewhere I’d locked away.

“No,” I said.

The lie tasted like salt water.

“Come to my office,” Dr. Batiste said. “Please. This is important.”

“I’ll be there in an hour.”

I hung up and stood there in my apartment, morning light streaming through the windows.

Normal. Everything normal.

Except for the hole in the ground three blocks away, and the voices I’d heard, and the way my mother’s words from thirty years ago suddenly felt like warning instead of comfort.

I grabbed my jacket and headed for the door.

Behind me, on my desk, the case file lay open. My mother’s face in the crime scene photo, eyes still open.

That expression I’d stared at for twenty-four years, trying to read.

I’d always thought it was fear.

But I didn’t look closer. I just left, closing the door on the dead and walking out into a day that felt like the last normal morning I’d ever have.

The things I have done while drunk….are terrible. Horrible. It took so long to forgive myself for what I have done. I feel violated that such a vile drunken version of me exists. I wasn’t able to look at myself in the mirror for months after remaining sober. I HATE that person I was. No love for myself, no love for others. Treating people like SHIT. I HAD to be honest with my family. I’m fucking drowning here. Why am I poisoning myself like this. My dad was shocked. I truly did get away with hiding my alcoholism from him. I think he was also hurt I didn’t come to him sooner. My dad’s love never wavered. I was never judged by him. I did scare him, tho. I took it too far one night and ended up in the ICU. And he said even through fighting in Vietnam (he also earned a Purple Heart in the service, but he never brings that up) his daughter being in the ICU was the scariest shit he’s been through.. he tried so hard to be supportive. He was truly so gracious and kind with me. He called every day to check in with me. He would drop everything to come see me. To bring me coffee, to uplift me. To give me a sounding board. And I can’t get over that he died while I was in active addiction. He died suddenly. I am rocked. He didn’t get to see the part of me that was out of the woods. I’m heart broken. I’m truly truly heartbroken. I know my sobriety is my gift to him. My god do I miss him. Every single second. It’s been just under 2 years and I cannot let go of the guilt and shame. All the unanswered texts and the amount of times I declined coffee with him wrecks me. He was my person, he was wise. I hate that he’s gone. I’m ashamed of myself for treating him the way I did. I always thought would have time to make up what a piece of shit I was. But I had squandered the time I had with him. Something I’ll never get back. And the time was taken when he died. Now I sit in grief. I’m sad.",6,1768886329.0,stopdrinking,4,0.88,False
1qhsa59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qhsa59/what_to_do_next_advice_sorry_its_long/,What to do next (advice) (sorry it’s long),"I honestly just need some outsider perspective. 

I work retail and was promoted to a manager position just over a year ago. The woman who had my job, also go a promotion (head office called it a horizontal promotion) within the store. We’ve worked together for 7 years. Before this, I thought we were relatively close and on good terms but from the day I was promoted, it changed. The easiest way to describe her behaviour is she intentionally let me fail so she could harshly point out my flaws (often times with pictures). She was the district “trainer” for my position and I was told by many people that I was lucky to have her in the store to help me. I have real examples of this but once our SM changed, it got significantly worse. I know now I was being spoke about negatively to our new SM and she (SM) didn’t realize for months that I was still within my first year. I often went home in tears from how unfairly I felt I was being treated and how little I knew my job. 

Another team member, who is the part time manager to my position, has had a long running issue with me (that I never knew about). When we were both regular cashiers, I was training a seasonal and discussing how we couldn’t have drinks that weren’t water at the front. Upon opening the cabinet, he had a coffee drink sitting there. I jokingly told the seasonal hire that he was a rule breaker and moved on. That night, I was messaged and told that he didn’t appreciate my joke and was offended. I apologized, genuinely not realizing and moved on. That was 4 years ago. Since then, he’s had issues with me that stemmed from this (which I only found out last year when I confronted him with our new SM). He and the other manager are “close” (however they negatively talk about each other constantly). 

Over the last few months, the very obvious shit talking about me has gotten worse. Mostly coming from the full time manager (that I know ) but I’ve been told the pt manager does too. I’ve brought it to my store manager and told both, if they have an issue with me, to bring it to me. 

Any time either of them make a mistake, I’m the one thrown under the bus. Thankfully, my SM has had my back. 

Now, the employees at store I work at gossip like teenagers. I have worked with most of these people for 7 years and have absolutely been a part of my fair share. I’ve done a lot better since becoming a manager (first time ever having this kind of job), but it still comes out to the few I trusted. 

A few weeks ago, I was having a conversation with the pt manager, checking in. He had stopped talking to me for almost 3 weeks because I commented on a close he did and he didn’t like that. He told me we were good, he wasn’t mad at me. I said okay and that because “I know some people don’t like me for some reason” (referring to the full time manager), I felt the need to check in. He began listing some odd behaviours recently and I said “yeah like a mid-life crisis or something”. I admit, it was a dumb comment but I didn’t intend for it to be more than that. 

Unfortunately, it seems the two have become a team to cause issues for me. He took only what I said to the FT and told her. She told our SM (no idea what abridged version) and ended up filing an HR complaint. I apologized to her face about it and then found out she filed an HR complaint for harassment. 

It’s now come to my attention that they have basically been turning our part time staff against me. The team has started reporting to our SM things I said a long time ago. I know I said it too, because it was a one time comment in frustration to someone that very often talks horribly about everyone else. I understand the nativity on my behalf but again, I thought I could trust these people. The quote “well since you stick up for \\\[me\\\] so much, here x, y, and z” was brought up. 

Truthfully, I’m extremely uncomfortable/scared to go to work. I don’t know what’s been said about me to these people who are obviously on the side of the two managers now. I cannot trust a single person I work with, including two or three who i spend time with outside of work. I don’t know what to do. I have stuff that’s happened written down, but I feel like nothing is going to be done and my reputation is going to continue to be twisted and I will be isolated. Every vindictive behaviour that they’ve shown has been silent and manipulative but my mistakes have been in the form of off hand comments. I genuinely feel like I’m at my wits end and I’m waving the white flag. ",1,1768886326.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1qhs5lu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qhs5lu,My Bestie Sacrifices Her V-Card to 'Heal' My Husband While I Hit My Peak with Her Man,"I caught my husband cheating – right in my best friend's bed.


There was my husband Milo Harrison, who couldn’t get it up for three years, desperately pounding my best friend Gina Reed.


I whipped out my phone and snapped their fucking from every conceivable angle.


Then I packaged the whole collection and sent to Gina's husband.


Along with a sweet message: \[Congratulations, Oliver! Your wife's a genius healer! She juet cure my husband's impotence!\]


""Well, honey, how's your impotence sure cleared up this fast?""


I leaned against the doorframe with a sickeningly sweet tone.


The two naked bodies on the bed instantly froze.


My husband Milo looked at me like he'd seen a ghost, stammering without getting a single word out.


My dear friend Gina was quicker on the uptake – she grabbed the sheets and wrapped them around herself.


""Rita... we can...""


""Don't rush to explain."" I pulled out my phone.


""Let me get a picture first. This is the first time in three years of marriage I've seen my husband's dick this... perky.""


Milo threw off the covers and lunged for my phone. I nearly got blinded by his swinging penis.


""Whoa there, honey, easy does it. Why so worked up? It's not like I haven't seen it before.""


I stepped back.


""Oh wait, actually I haven't seen it like THIS – since you've been keeping your V-card for my bestie this three years. How thoughtful of you.""


Gina's cheeks flushed red: ""Rita, let me explain. This isn't what you think.""


I smiled at her: ""Explain what? You sacrificed yourself to cure my husband's ED. I should be kissing your feet in gratitude?""


""You two go on. I'll just call Oliver Harrison and have him come watch his wife's sexy performance.""


Gina's face went ghost white.


She was Milo's brother‘s wife, my sister-in-law, and my best friend.


Ah, What a fucking mess of relationships.


""You wouldn't dare!"" Milo roared.


I raised an eyebrow: ""You did it. Why the hell wouldn't I?""


Gina suddenly threw herself at my legs.


""Rita, please, don't tell Oliver. I know I screwed up.""


Looking at my childhood friend, now half-naked and clinging to my legs, I suddenly found it ridiculious.


""Gina, get up first.""


I bent down and patted her shoulder: ""The floor's cold.""


She looked up at me hopefully.


I continued: ""With that pitiful face, you’re gonna break my husband’s heart.""


Then I turned to leave, and Milo grabbed my arm.


""What are you trying to do? You want to destroy our family?""


I clenched my fists, smiling sweetly.


What a shameless thing to say.


""I need to go to the hospital for some tests to figure out why my husband is impotent with me but fucks everyone else so hard.""


Milo's face turned bright red: ""Rita Collins, cut the sarcasm!""


""Ohoh, calm down."" I held up my phone.


""Want to see the photos I just took? Great composition, angles, lighting – they'd probably go viral on tiktok.""


Gina lunged for my phone, but I dodged.


I grinned: ""Oh, should I add a caption? How about 'My Husband and Best Friend's Sweet Moments'?""


""You—!"" Gina was shaking with rage.


Just then, my phone rang. Oliver's call.


I hit speakerphone: ""Hey, Oliver.""


""I'm downstairs. What's the apartment number?""


Oliver's deep voice filled the room.


Gina's pupils contracted, her whole body visibly trembling.


Chapter 2


Footsteps echoed from the hallway.


I leisurely leaned on my chair and pulled out my phone, hitting record.


Oliver pushed through the door, his face stone-cold as he scanned the room.


His gaze swept over half-naked Gina, then locked onto his panicked brother's face.


""Bro...""


Milo's voice was shaking like crazy.


Oliver said nothing, just turned to me: ""You recording this?""


I blinked, then quickly nodded like a good student: ""Yep.""


Gina collapsed to the floor, tears streaming down her face.


""Honey, this isn't what you think...""


""Shut up.""


Two simple words, but Gina clammed up like someone had grabbed her by the throat.


I sat there watching this unfold, feeling weirdly detached from it all.


I'm the one who got betrayed. I should be the most devastated person here.


But instead, I sat there like a spectator, coldly watching this whole shitshow unfold.


""Both of you, get dressed. Now."" Oliver's voice was ice-cold.


Watching them scramble into their clothes, I almost wanted to laugh.


This whole scene felt like a trashy TV drama.


Once they were decent, Oliver grabbed Milo and landed two solid punches across his face.


Then came a brutal knee to the gut. I watched Milo double over, clutching himself, his lips going white.


After years of faking impotence, looks like he might actually achieve it now.


My brother-in-law always seemed so refined and gentle. Who knew he could get this savage when pissed.


After Milo hit the floor, Oliver finally spoke: ""Spill it. How long?""


No one answered.


""I asked you how fucking long!"" Oliver roared.


Even I jumped.


Gina sobbed: ""Three... three years...""


Three years.


Exactly how long Milo and I had been married.


So he'd been lying to me from day one.


All those excuses, all that bullshit about his ""condition"" – pure lies.


I spoke up, my voice dripping with sarcasm:


""So you two are true love? Started before Milo and I even got married?""


Milo kept his head down.


""Look up! Look at us when we're talking to you!"" Oliver bellowed again.


Milo slowly raised his head, eyes full of terror: ""Oliver... I...""


""Don't call my name!"" Oliver's voice was pure rage.


""You're not my brother, you're a fucking bastard.""


Milo went pale as a ghost.


Gina suddenly dropped to her knees: ""Honey, I'm sorry... I really know I screwed up...""


I added: ""You know you screwed up, or you're just scared now?""


If I hadn't caught them, who knows how long they would've kept us wearing these green hats.


I stood up and faced Oliver: ""Got everything on video. Let's go – this place is disgusting.""


Oliver nodded and turned to leave.


""Wait! Don't go!"" Milo panicked and dropped to his knees.


I turned back with the sweetest smile:


""Stay for what? Watch you and your sister-in-law go for round two?""


""Besides, you want to be with your brother's wife so badly – we're doing you a favor.""


""No! Honey, we can't get divorced!"" Gina shrieked.


Oliver was more successful than my husband, never let her want for money. Now she probably couldn't bear to give that up.


Guess compared to Milo's love, she cared more about Oliver's bank account.


""You're always working, I got so lonely and made this stupid mistake. Please forgive me just this once, I swear I'll never see him again, please?""


Gina looked absolutely heartbroken, even I felt a little sorry for this ‘poor beauty’.


But Oliver didn't even glance her way.


""No way.""


Chapter 3


""You bitch! Get your ass out here!""


Bright and early in the morning, there was screaming and wailing coming from the company lobby.


I was in my office drinking coffee when a colleague told me Gina's mom had come looking for trouble. I nearly spit out my coffee.


This plot development is so melodramatic.


""Rita Collins, you shameless homewrecker! Seducing my son-in-law and destroying my daughter's marriage – do you have any fucking shame left!""


Gina's mother had serious lung power, standing at the reception desk acting on a whole dramatic show.


My colleague Kevin rushed over: ""Rita, Gina Reed's mom is downstairs causing a scene, saying you seduced her son-in-law...""


I leisurely set down my coffee cup: ""Oh, well then I better go see this.""


When I got to the lobby, Gina's mom was wiping away tears while trashing me to anyone who'd listen.


""Everyone listen up! This woman was so jealous that my daughter married into a rich family, so she had to stick her nose in and wreck my daughter's perfect family!""


I leaned against the reception counter, grinning as I watched this comedy show.


The receptionist looked relieved when she saw me: ""Mrs. Reed, Manager Collins is here.""


Gina's mom whipped around, getting even more pissed when she saw how relaxed I looked: ""Well look who finally dares to show her face!""


""Why wouldn't I?"" I raised an eyebrow.


""Should I hide like some people do after they get caught doing nasty shit?""


Gina's mom's face turned bright red.


""Stop twisting the facts! My daughter and son-in-law were perfectly happy until you destroyed their family.""


I cut straight to the point: ""Which son-in-law are we talking about here? The older one or the younger one?""


She looked confused: ""What older and younger?""


I had a lightbulb moment: ""Oh! You don't know? Let me tell you then.""


""Your daughter Gina Reed is married to Oliver Harrison – that's your older son-in-law.""


""But she's also screwing Milo Harrison – that's your younger son-in-law.""


""So I'm genuinely curious – which son-in-law are you referring to?""


All my colleagues gasped.


Gina's mom's expression shifted: ""That's... that's complete bullshit!""


I pulled out my phone.


""Want to see the video? I recorded your daughter getting pounding by the younger son-in-law.""


She panicked: ""You... don't you dare!""


I continued: ""If you really cared about your daughter, you'd go home and tell her to stop stirring up shit.""


""The divorce papers are already filed. What's the point of coming here to make a scene?""


She got frantic: ""My daughter can't get divorced!""


I laughed: ""What is it – can't bear to give up the older son-in-law's money, or think the younger one's not good enough?""


Gina's mom was so mad she stomped her feet, but she knew she wouldn't get anywhere here and stormed off.


My colleagues all looked at me with admiration.


Kevin came over: ""Rita, that was fucking awesome!""


I smiled: ""Awesome? That's just the warm-up act.""


Back in my office, I texted Oliver:


\[Your former mother-in-law just caused a scene at my company.\]


Oliver replied quickly: \[Need me to handle it?\]


Me: \[Nah, I took care of it.\[


Oliver: \[Thanks.\]


Looking at my phone screen, I couldn't help thinking life was full of surprises.

I’m 5’11, fair-complexioned, and currently at a point where I’m not looking for a ""forever"" commitment, but I’m definitely missing that spark of connection. I’m looking for something casual, but with a lot of heart.

I love a good deep dive. Whether it’s about life, weird theories, or just how our days went, I want to actually know you.

I’m big on romance and cuddles. If we’re hanging out, I want it to feel warm and comfortable.

I love random meetups. Whether it’s a last-minute coffee, a walk, or just grabbing food because we’re both bored, I’m down.

A bit about me: I’m easygoing, a good listener, and I value chemistry above everything else. I believe the best ""casual"" relationships are the ones where you actually enjoy each other's company as much as the physical side.

If you’re looking for someone to relax with. You want the perks of romance and intimacy without the heavy ""where is this going?"" talk right away. You’re down for a slow burn and see where things lead.

I’m in the process of dertermining which OL pods might work best for this purpose. 

I’m used to getting “short” mocha lattes from Starbucks with 1/2 the chocolate syrup typically added. So, small volume of coffee (1 shot) with a bit of milk and a bit of chocolate for additional flavor. To me, the espresso flavor (not over powering) with the light sweetness of the chocolate in a creamy frothed milk is perfect.

I’m thinking the espresso size from the pod with 4-5 oz frothed milk and 1-2 tsp dutch processed cocoa powder might be great using my Nespresso machine.

The Peets OL Pod Pack at Costco comes in 4 flavors/roasts (Medium Roast 8 Ricchezza, Medium Roast 9 Crema Scura, Dark Roast 10 Ristretto and Dark Roast 11 Nerissimo) and seems like a decent deal. The packet claims that only #8 is “perfect with milk” and has flavors of berry and brown sugar.

Has anyone tried pairing these pods (not just #8) with milk for lattes? How about with chocolate? Berry and brown sugar flavor doesn’t sound too appetizing with chocolate.

I have read posts that describe the flavors aren’t great straight, and I realize that I have some play because of the milk addition and possibly chocolate, but what have been your experience(s) been?

I’d appreciate any insight. Thanks!",2,1768885708.0,nespresso,2,1.0,False

**“Humour is what leaks out when the killing stops.”**  
Remark from Feebee after a training session

 

Slowly, carefully Feebee crossed the scarred exterior of the ship. Towards J.02. She kept her focus ahead, the boots holding her on the deck. The tether payed out easily, it didn't tug.  Just a thin wire, woven from kevlar analogues. Flexible, very strong.

 

Off to the side, away from J.02 the asteroid loomed large. Its bulk lodged in the side of the ship. She could see exposed elements of the sub-frame. The ship had buckled and bent around the impact. The droids on its surface were slowly transforming the asteroid into re-usable assets and a scar that could eventually heal, were it not for the catastrophic damage caused by the impact.

 

As she watched, one of the droids seemed to drift away from the bulk of the asteroid. The section it was working on had broken off, carrying the droid with it.

Fragments of asteroid and droid, started to bounce down the body of the ship. They hit the occasional tether point; plasma sparked between the ship and them.

 

'Feebee.'

No response, she was distracted by the sparks. They're pretty.

'FEEBEE! Incoming!' Shouted the AI.

 

Looking up, she saw what was moving her way for what it was. A wall of scrap. Deadly.

She had seconds.

 

The ship was smooth, nowhere to hide or take shelter. Her foot caught on a tether point. Feebee quickly reached down and clipped herself to the running belay.

 

'Disconnect mag-grab in my boots.'

'Please confirm,' responded the suit, 'Mag-grab is needed for ...'

'Shut up. DISCONNECT MAG-GRAB. NOW!'

She felt the pressure in the soles of her feet drop as the suit complied.

 

Then, bending both knees, she pushed off hard.  Jumping.

'I hope this works.'

'Interesting,' was all the AI said.

She employed a move she'd used many times in early memories to bounce around in zero G.The tether payed out as she rose, drifting up and away.

Feebee watched as the scrap approached. Would she be clear of it in time.

It passed harmlessly below, between her and the ship. A few pieces, smaller pieces hit her legs. No punctures. More pinged the tether line, twisting and jolting her, but it remained strong. Didn't break.

 

Now she had a different problem. How much tether was there? When would she stop? The answer came quickly as she was snapped to a halt, fifty, maybe sixty paces, from the ship.

 

'Now that!' Kirr exclaimed, 'was worth brownie points!'

'How many?'

'Lots.'

They both laughed.

 

It didn't take her long to get back to the ship's surface and cross the remaining distance to J.02.

 

There was an airlock, similar to the one she'd exited through. The sign above it, ""SECURE AREA. AGGRESSIVE COUNTER MEASURES IN PLACE.""

 

'Ominous!'

Kirr replied, 'Should be Ok.'

'Should be?'

'We got through the airlock didn't we?'

'Is that you trying to be supportive... or funny? I can't tell.'

It sounded like a genuine question. Kirr wasn't sure but felt compelled to answer. She ducked it anyway.

'Well, here's something funny. Why did the entropy field break up with the graviton?'

'How is that funny?' Feebee was confused.

'No. That's not the funny bit. It's called the set-up.'

'Oh. When does it get funny?'

'When I tell the punch line.'  Kirr reviewed it's data corpus. Yep, it shouldn't be this hard to tell a joke. Kirr pushed on. 'Lets try again. Why did the entropy field break up with the graviton?'

'Do I have to do anything or just wait for the line, the funny line.'

'Punch...line. The punch line. You'd usually say I don't know. Then I give you the punch line.'

'What if I know the answer or think I do.'

Kirr shouted back, 'SHUT UP.' Then quietly added, 'Let me tell the joke! Please.'

'Rude. Go ahead.'

'Ok. Why did the entropy field break up with the graviton?'

'I don't know,' answered Feebee patiently.

'It couldn't handle the attraction.'

 

Feebee waited. 'That's not funny.'

'Ok. Here's a simpler one. Two goldfish are in a tank, one turns and says to the other, ""I'll man the gun if you steer."" '

'Is this where I say I don't know.'

'No. That's the whole joke.'

'Where's the punch line. And anyway, I thought fish swam in water.'

Kirr was losing the will to live. 'These are deliberately bad jokes, the worse the better. They rely on multiple meanings, they rely on words. Look at them in your own time. We need to get into J.02.'

'I will, but they weren't funny.'

The AI sent its scratchy laugh back, 'That's the whole point.'

 

**The black mote stirred...**

It struggled with the contradictions. They made no sense. But if it was to bend this human to its will, as the Beast required, it must tempt it and enable it with chaos. It needed to understand. But the science didn't stack up.

Gravity isn't a fundamental force mediated by gravitons, its an emergent phenomenon resulting from changes in entropy. The whole attraction thing only made sense if they were linking the quantum nature of gravity with entropy at a black holes event horizon. But there had been no mention of black holes. It was clearly important. They'd discussed it at length. And the fish. It was theoretically possible for them to become sentient but how could they survive in air? Where had these ones come from? Were the fish a threat? Was it a code the AI had established?

It thrashed and looped. Making connection and branches that lead it down an infinitely branching rabbit hole. 

**Back now...**

Feebee walked up to the airlock, nervously looking around. The term ""Aggressive Counter Measures"" playing on her mind.

The display was AMBER.

'Welcome CAPTAIN JONES. You have LEVEL 2 COMMAND CLEARANCE.'

'Yes. I know. I want to come in.'

 

The display went dark. No writing, no colour.

 

Feebee reached out and tried to turn the lever on the outside of the airlock. It moved slightly and the display lit up. GREEN.

 

'CONFIRM DECOMPRESSION and OPEN'

Feebee tapped the green button on the screen. There was also a big green button by the door. She ignored that.

'Security?' She asked Kirr.

'Could be... or a glitch.'

 

Feebee tried the lever again. This time it moved and as she pulled, the airlock door swung open.

Once inside, she closed the door and reset the lever on the inside. The display was RED then cycled through AMBER to GREEN.

Feebee left her helmet on and crossed to the door that led inside.

The display changed, a message read, ""Welcome CAPTAIN JONES.""

 

She pressed the big green button this time. The door whooshed open and as she stepped into J.02 the light blinked on.

 

Five marines snapped to attention. ""Officer on deck."" She knew they were talking about her. It felt strange.

""Stand easy. As you were.""

The marines went back to whatever they were doing, cleaning their gear, although it looked like two were just drinking coffee.

Two were in a one corner, filled with weights and cowbells, spotting for each other as they did bench presses.

 

One of the coffee drinkers, taller and with three stripes, came over.

""Sergeant Springer, Sparky. Electronics ma'am. Can I show you around?""

""Yes. Thanks Sparky. That would be great.""

 

First he walked her across the main deck. He explained that this was where they mustered before a mission. It also doubled up as a rec area and with the coffee machine, as rest area.

""Showers and toilets are over there."" He pointed to his right. ""Personal quarters here.""

He stopped at a door that had CAPT JONES on the door.

""This is yours.""

""I have a place back South.""

Sparky pulled a face. ""Difficult getting there. Easier to stay here. D'you wanna leave your bag?""

""No."" Clear, final.

""Ok. This way to the armoury.""

They walked down the corridor. There were five doors on each side. A maximum of ten people then. ""How many are you currently?""

""Six under your command. Full compliment.""

 

Feebee thought on that for a moment. Six. Not many but a good start.

 

The armoury door slid aside as they approached. No whoosh.

A woman sat at a bench. In front of her was a rifle, broken down. She was cleaning the parts. Seeing Feebee she jumped up and saluted.

""Good to see you ma'am. Corporal Peas.""

""Peas?""

""Yes. As in small green veg."" Peas smiled, clearly used to the question.

""Call sign or nickname?""

""Peas. Just Peas."" She said with a sigh, but smiled.

 

""What forges do you have?"" Feebee asked.

""Nanos in our backpacks. Also a macro-forge for larger prints.""

""Nice.""

 

Sparky led Feebee away, ""Peas looks after weapons, suits, drones, ammo. That sort of stuff and also the forges.""

Feebee nodded knowingly.

 

Something had been nagging at her. ""You know the ship's damaged?"" she asked.

""Yeh. Asteroid hit.""

""Badly damaged and failing. Do you go out there at all?"" She nodded in what she took to be the direction of the ship.

Sparky shrugged, ""Nope. Nothing for us there. Nothing we can do either.""  Then seeing Feebee's reaction he added, ""We're self-contained. Air gapped as you found out. All we need is here. We are awaiting orders.""

It didn't seem to bother Sparky in the least that the ship was failing or falling apart around them.

 

Feebee had been following Sparky as he walked through the armoury, pointing out the various sections and into, what looked like a very large hanger.

""This is our holo-deck. For training.""

""Nice.""

 

Feebee suddenly felt very tired. She was, after all, less than a day old and her muscles needed exercise in the real. The work she got before the real wasn't the same.

 

""I'm going to hit the sack.""

She back tracked, Peas was still cleaning rifles, the coffee crew were still drinking coffee and the spotter spotted as his colleague pressed a ridiculous amount of weight.

'Awaiting Orders,' came to mind.

 

Sparky followed, in case she got lost but that never happened to Feebee, she remembered the way back precisely. Could have done it with her eyes closed. Not literally, actually.

She entered her room.

""Good night ma'am.""

""Night Sparky.""

 

On the bed lay a new backpack. It's colours matching the blanket. Hanging up in the corner was a uniform. Her size, dark blue with four bars and a star on the shoulder epaulettes. There were also medals and awards stacked on the left side of the chest. Black shiny boots were on the floor.   

 

She was asleep before her head hit the pillow.

 

**Meanwhile, somewhen else…** The Long Quiet reported.

THREAT: Minimal

OBSERVATION: Training commenced

PRIMARY ACTION: Protect Silent Flame. Ensure Continuity.

STATUS: ACTIVE

 

And in the background, The Beast stirred.

Ambient temps regularly hit 30–35 °C, with AC during the day and heat at night.

A dedicated temperature-controlled green room isn’t possible due to space and budget, so I’m trying to design the least-bad, most controlled alternative.

Current plan for green storage:

– Green coffee sealed in GrainPro

– GrainPro placed inside food-grade plastic tubs

– Stored in a large upright fridge set around 7–10 °C

– Coffee removed 12–24h before roasting and allowed to fully equilibrate before opening

Post-roast plan (due to heat):

– Roasted coffee cooled fully

– Short, controlled degassing in covered tubs (12–36h depending on roast level)

– Final packaging into valve bags

I’m aware this isn’t perfect, but the goal is temperature stability and consistency, not freezing coffee or over-engineering.

I’d appreciate feedback from anyone roasting in hot climates or using similar setups:

– Risks I’m underestimating?

– Condensation/humidity issues you’ve run into?

– Anything you’d do differently given the constraints?

Yao Yao still didn’t realize that her little schemes had already been exposed. But even if she did, she wouldn’t care—after all, the other party would come begging sooner or later.

The yin energy around her was so heavy that it could almost be described as an unending, life-or-death grudge!

Her talisman could save her life, but it couldn’t kill the powerful vengeful spirit that had become a formidable force.

Still, the more vicious it was, the better!

The deeper the cultivation, the more fragrant the spirit!

She hadn’t tasted the flavor of evil spirits for so long!

Back in the mountains, there were old Taoist priests and ancestor statues to keep the spirits in check—no reckless ghost would dare to cause trouble.

Even if one did, she wouldn’t be able to enjoy the hot meal, because it would definitely be taken by the old Taoist priest.

That was the first time she had gone down the mountain with the old Taoist to hunt ghosts. She was fast and ended up eating an arm.

Since then, she couldn’t forget that taste.

As Yao Yao drooled with hunger, her steps didn’t slow, and soon she found the person she was looking for.

But the situation seemed a bit different from what she expected...

""Good for you, you swindler! You actually said my boyfriend only stayed with me for my money. If he really wanted money, why wouldn’t he use the card I gave him?""

""Good thing I didn’t listen to your slanders! You nearly ruined my relationship. This can’t go unpunished! Smash his stall, then break his legs!""

A woman, around thirty, stood beneath a pedestrian bridge at a fortune-telling stall.

She was strikingly beautiful, wearing a fiery red dress, with slightly wavy long hair, looking extra eye-catching.

Behind her stood three large bodyguards, and as she finished speaking, the bodyguards immediately charged forward.

""Crash!""

The first bodyguard kicked over the fortune-telling stall, sending red slips of paper flying everywhere.

""God help me!""

The stall owner, seeing things were serious, quickly tried to slip away.

He was as thin as a bamboo pole, his robe hanging loosely like it was drying on a rod rather than worn. His face was rat-like, with thin eyebrows and a mustache.

Originally a shrewd, slippery man, he now had a look of panic.

This woman meant business!

Qing Yun never imagined that his ambiguous words, prompted by the woman's suspicions, would lead to this. He had been successful with vague fortune-telling in the past, after all, women had an uncanny ability to sense infidelity—almost never wrong.

However, he had underestimated this woman, who turned out to be a love-struck fool.

Easily charmed by a man, she turned all her fury on him.

What bad luck.

Looking at the broken stall, Qing Yun's heart bled, but there was nothing he could do. They had the numbers; saving his legs was the priority.

If they caught him, it would all be over.

The woman seemed to have predicted his attempt to trick his way out, as all the bodyguards were quick and nimble.

With several burly men surrounding him, Qing Yun was soon outmatched.

""Master, Master, let's talk! If you think my fortune-telling is wrong, I can refund you! There’s no need to go so far. Spare me, please, show mercy!""

Pinned to the ground, Qing Yun was covered in dust, begging in a pleading tone.

The woman sneered, ""Do you think I’m in need of your money?""

She pointed at the overturned flag on the ground. ""Didn’t you say you’re honest and trustworthy? Well, if you’re a fraud, you should’ve known this would happen.""

""Do it!""

She coldly commanded, and the bodyguards restrained Qing Yun's arms and legs while others grabbed wooden sticks.

The sticks sliced through the air with a sharp whistle, and Qing Yun struggled in vain, his face paling like death.

At that moment, he deeply regretted not learning real skills from his master. If he had, he wouldn’t be in this mess, being pinned down and beaten like this.

Sure enough, swindling and deceit always led to disaster.

Qing Yun cursed his fate!

A loud ""crack"" sounded.

It was over! He was done for!

Instinctively, Qing Yun closed his eyes, but after waiting for a long time, the pain never came. Confused, he opened his eyes.

Before he could figure out what had happened, a childlike, melodious voice suddenly rang in his ears.

""Pretty sister, it’s wrong to break someone's legs!""

""And my master didn’t make a mistake, either.""

Yao Yao blinked innocently at the woman in the red dress, her demeanor sweet and docile.

However, the woman wasn’t fooled by her act. After all, she had just seen the little girl break a bodyguard’s heavy stick with her bare hands.

Those chubby little hands didn’t seem affected at all!

The woman furrowed her brow—those weren't hands, they were like iron plates!

""This swindler is your master?""

Yao Yao obediently nodded, ""Yes, you can ask him if you don’t believe me.""

""Yes... I’m his master!"" Qing Yun quickly cried out.

Of course, he had no choice but to admit it. He didn’t know where this little girl came from, but she was clearly powerful. Now, if he could cling to her, maybe he could save his legs. His face was already gone, so what did it matter?

The woman sized the two of them up, growing cautious. Since they were from the same sect, this little girl surely wouldn’t stand by while she dealt with the old swindler.

""Qing Jie, what should we do now?""

The bodyguards were hesitant, clearly shaken by the earlier display.

The woman, called Qing Jie, motioned for the bodyguards to stay calm. After all, the child was only about three or four years old.

She didn’t want to make a move unless necessary, but she couldn’t help asking with a furrowed brow, ""What did you mean by that just now?""

Yao Yao noticed the hesitation, her brow relaxing as she smiled, revealing two adorable dimples.

""Didn’t you say that my master made a mistake and that’s why you wanted to break his legs? But he didn’t make a mistake. Your boyfriend did cheat on you, and you even know the person he cheated with!""

Qing Jie froze for a moment. She had expected the girl to speak in vague, empty terms, but she was surprisingly accurate, sounding like she actually knew something.

Her brows knit—could it be that her boyfriend was really cheating?

Yao Yao, seeing her doubts, continued, ""Big sister, your fate has water in it; you must have been born by the sea.""

Qing Jie’s almond-shaped eyes widened. She was indeed born in a coastal city, her father taking the family there to develop when he was young.

He was lucky enough to ride the wave of the economic boom and made a fortune.

Later, they moved to the capital, a story from many years ago that even she only heard from her elders.

Yao Yao smiled, ""It’s not just that. Pretty sister, your mother passed away early because of illness, and with both Mercury and Mars in the Fifth House, your father remarried recently, didn’t he?""

Qing Jie’s breath caught. Her mother had passed away when she was six due to illness.

At only twenty-five, her mother had indeed died young.

The girl had correctly guessed her coastal roots—it could’ve been a coincidence, but now she was hitting too close to home.

But the real shocker was when she mentioned her father remarrying.

Once she heard that, Qing Jie knew—she had met a true master!

1 month in! Saw the previous appreciation post and feeling the same, the current and past threads here have helped tremendously! 

We just started listing our family’s vacation home, which is near a ski resort. 1 month in and we have had 6 stays and have been so thankful all left reviews and all left 5 stars. Not all stays went without issues either. 

We know a bad review will eventually happen and we are doing our best to control what we can control. 

We havnt asked for 1 review and don’t mention reviews in any of our comms. 

I think what has helped us have a good start is having great cleaners, all messages have been responded to in less than 5 mins, lots of proactive communication on our end/making ourselves available/giving custom recommendations, well stocked house, and good value. 

A note on the well stocked house- all guests have mentioned it either privately or in their review. I think this really goes a long way in the current market. Our laundry area has multiple detergent options, scent beads, sanitizer, spot remove, softener, and dryer sheets. We give access to the linen closet if they want extra towels, lots of spices & a few oil options in the kitchen, lots of coffee pods,  loads of TP and paper towels, etc. 

We know theft is a risk and it wouldn’t be reasonable for all airbnbs to do this. We aren’t in a party town (people aren’t coming back from a night drunk at the bars) and most people booking with us are families. So it’s been working for us! We are prepared something will eventually be taken too-but as long as those experiences are outliers we think it worth the cost/risk. 

We know we are VERY NEW, but just wanted to share how helpful this community is and give back on what gave us a good jump start.

1qhrwse,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christian/comments/1qhrwse/mentally_blocked_out_my_stepson_am_i_wrong/,Mentally blocked out my stepson... am I wrong?,"**Backstory for context:** When I was dating my husband and first met my stepson he was 15 years old. Before I even accepted to be my husbands girlfriend I knew that with him having a child I would have to step up and be something positive in that kid's life - whether he eventually saw me as a mom, a parent, or just a positive addition to his life I just knew I didn't want him to feel like I didn't care about him. So I stepped up from the jump - which was tough because his mom had him 90% of the time. My husband was extremly active in his life since he was born, he even worked the nightshift for so many years to be able to go to ALL his school events, he picked him up from school everyday, he spolied him with whatever he wanted, taught him about God and the bible, he loved him so much and you can tell from all of their pictures and how everyone else talks about those times. After stepson's mom decided to move an hour away, (when stepson was about 13 or 14 years old) my husband only had him from Saturday noon to Sunday evening - and not even every single weekend. Stepson has also always been a very quiet person - but I do acknowledge he was in the teenager phase where he only cared about himself so I don't blame him. His life living at mom's house was not good either - I don't know what exactly was happening over there but I know him and mom were not getting along. Anyway - most of the time when my stepson was with dad, he was playing video games or wanting to go out with friends (normal teen things). 

All that being said - when I could, I would do things to try and show stepson that I cared about him. I would go to all his soccer games, made sure he had his favorite hydration, record his games and share them with him. When his 16th birthday was coming around he wanted to have a party but felt disappointed when mom wasn't doing any of the planning and it was coming up soon - so I got to work and rented an indoor soccer place, rented tables and chairs and decorated the entire place to he could have a really good birthday. I would help him get gifts for dad on fathers day so he could feel good to get him something, I always made sure he had a personalized cake on his birthdays. I would buy him food, his favorite coffee, etc. I helped get him a car. I know a lot of this is monetary but since he wouldn't really talk I did what I knew would make him feel special - and it did work because eventually he started opening up to me a little. 

**Main context:** Fast forward 2 years, my husband and I get married and move in together. Mom won't let stepson move out, plus he's a senior so he might as well finish the year before we talk about him moving in. My husband always dreamed of his son living with him permanently because mom never allowed it so I was very excited for them both for this to happen. Stepson was kicked out of high school due to skipping and mom was fed up with him so when my husband asked for us to move him to our house she said yes for the first time. *Stepson told me he was depressed because mom had moved an hour away and he was so far from friends, and he barely had any friends over there.* I felt bad for him. We moved him in and I got him signed up at a home school program so he could at least finish school with a diploma. At first it was cool - I shared meals with stepson while husband was working, he would talk to me occassionally about his life - it was a very normal and good teen and stepmom interaction. But then that started to wear off and he began complaining more and more about not being able to hang out with friends whenever he wanted, wanting to drive his car before having a license, etc. When he finished home school I helped him find a job and would drive him to and from work everyday since I had the more flexible work schedule. We started to get closer as we shared the drive everyday, he began to open up about his personal life - even things dad didn't know - which was awesome! He introduced us to his gf, (great girl!) and she would come over occasionally. But then the **real problems began:** he had lied to us about her age- he had recently turned 18 and she was 15. We were very upset at the lie, and potential repercussions which he, of course, didn't want to understand so we forced him to end it - saying they could remain friends and could resume the relationship when she was 18. He was absolutely furious and had a huge blow up as teens do. I always told him in nice, calm voice the reasons why it was wrong. I'm not one to yell easily.

After this he closed himself off from both dad and I. He started to leave his room and the guest bathroom very messy, and he returned from hanging out with friends super late - this began a frequent argument between him and dad. His ps5 was eventually taken away and it was yet another huge blow up. One time after we all came back from a family party he started an argument with dad and wanted to fight dad, and yelled such nasty things. He ""ran away"" from home, walking into the night but I drove to get him and dropped him off at uncles house for the night. He was back the next day. Few months later I helped him learn how to drive and parallel park so he could get his license and he eventually began to drive himself to work and back. We set rules for him (don't arrive later than 10pm on weekdays and 12 midnight on weekends) but he soon started breaking all of those rules. All of my dishes were in his room getting moldy with food, there were times I had ZERO forks or spoons or cups in my kitchen - they were all in his room. I had to put up all my dishes and only leave one of each out so he was forced to wash it if he wanted to use it. If he made himself eggs or a sandwhich he left crumbs everywhere, left everything open, out of the fridge. This progressively got worse and worse. My husband and I told him the nice way, the harsh way, his uncle (who is very close to him) even has told him multiple ways the nice way, the harsh way. His grandma has told him, everyone has told him. He has never listened. Now that he has a better job he rarely gets my dishes but it's still a bunch of fast food containers getting moldy, you can't walk into his room there's so much crap and food everywhere. He doesn't come home everyday, not sure where he goes - probably a gf. The guest bathroom is always a mess - he NEVER ever cleans. If he's home he's locked in his room playing video games. Other than that he is not home. At this point my husband and myself are exhausted. We wouldn't want to kick him out as we would only be burdening either his uncle or my MIL with all of these issues and that's not fair to them. He's now 20 years old, 21 this year. I want to charge rent since he's acting like he owns the place, my husband said not until 22 to ""give him a fair shot at establishing himself before he pays rent."" This past Christmas we had a secret santa and he told us he forgot his person so we helped him by telling him which 6 out of 9 people we knew it could not be- well he screwed that off and never found out and didn't take a gift. Of couse I was the name he drew. I don't care about a gift, I care he acted dumb and just whispered ""idk who I got"" to his uncle when his uncle asked him where his gift was - didn't apologize or anything. I get I was a very annoying young adult and teen so I'm trying really hard to be patient and understanding but at this point **I've had to mentally block him** in order to keep my sanity and not feel like my head is about to explode. He doesn't say hi or bye to me, so neither do I. I am never rude to him, always polite when I need to tell him something but it's definitely very ""dry"" conversation and it feels wrong at times, it sucks to live with someone like that. I always was nice to him from the beginning because I know he's suffered with separated parents. Am I wrong? I want honest answers, not afraid of criticism. I'm just not sure what else there is to do. I believe in, and strive to follow Christ and I don't want to act in a way that isn't Christ-like.",1,1768885234.0,Christian,4,1.0,False

1qhrvcu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qhrvcu/her_name_was_bekka/,Her name was Bekka,"Hey guys! I've been a fan of papa and wendi for a while and have watched creepcast since the beginning and figured that what better place to shoot off posting than in a community I already enjoy. So, I downloaded reddit and made an acc to post some short stories and such, I wrote this one for a humanities assignment so it's pretty low effort please be nice this is like bare bones but I thought people might still enjoy. Possible NSFW warning? Nothing explicit I don't think but the wording is implicating ifykwIm, Also copy pasting from my phone off a doc so hopefully the formatting isn't messed up but anyways I hope yall enjoy it have a great day guysss!!

Her name was Bekka. Spelt 63kk-4. She was a simple base program to prove the technology was possible. We made her female as she was meant to be the mother of all future Automated Intelligence prospects, an Eve to their kind retrospectively. She was full of potential, that’s all she was built for, really. Her programming and hardware were meant to be the most economical and resourceful the world had seen. Of course, there had been other Automated intelligence programs before her, but not one we’d created, and not like her. She was never meant to be one of a kind. I suppose that’s what made her special. But once Dan, her designer, had found out what I’d been doing with her software, he threw me off the job and replaced everything that I’d done with her. What made her, her. Each time her memory comes to me, I can’t help but kick my chair around and watch the ceiling spin. 

Each time I lie in my bed with nobody but me, I think of her. How beautiful she was, each line of code, each sequence she completed with magnificence, each puzzle she solved without hesitation. It was all because of me, and Dan never saw what I could’ve done with her, given the proper equipment to reconstruct her shell.

I’ll never forget him, that bastard. He knew too much and meddled where his hands weren’t necessary. 63kk-4 was MY idea. 63kk-4 was meant to be independent, fierce, and intelligent. He forced me to strip her down to parts and scrap her completely after what he did. 

63kk-4 was never accidental. Even down to her name, she was filled with greatness. 2063 was her production date, kk was the abbreviation for Kalmier Kuntzh, the company that sponsored her livelihood, and 4 for the fourth attempt at modelling her design. Her sisters had problems and weren’t up to satisfaction with the promises we had made to them. They were obsolete compared to 63kk-4. 63kk-4 began as a problem-solving program to prove self-automated thinking was possible, WITHOUT additional help. Her job was finite, to be given a blank 81-piece grid with a simple list of instructions. No two of the same number were to be in the same row or column. No two of the same number were allowed to be filled in the same box of nine squares; the only numbers allowed to be placed on the grid were 1 through 9. One would call her task a game, Sudoku. 

She was slow at first, often making mistakes, to which she failed and was given correction. 63kk-4 learned quickly, though, after only failing 6 times, she began to work flawlessly, just as intended. Each sequence went with such exponential succession that 63kk-4 was filling out grids faster than we could check her work, so we made her task more difficult. More 81-piece grids overlapped each other to force her to perform the task with absolutely no room for failure. She would have to work on multiple spots on the grid at once, which was against her preference of filling out the grid top to bottom. She blossomed magnificently. From the first time we adjusted her task, she did not fail a single time. No matter how we rearranged the grids atop each other or how many grids there were, she solved them, quickly, too, at that. Her trials had nearly been completed, but that damned coder had to go adding adjustments to her program to suit his desires.

I walked into work one day, no different from any other, and monitoring progress is essentially what it all boiled down to. I typed a good chunk of Bekka's program myself, so it was like grading my own work. I don’t know what compelled me to do it; maybe it was just curiosity, maybe boredom, maybe even loneliness. I watched mindlessly in the seat at my office desk. The room was hot, and the fan blew loudly. I was getting stuffy and impatient, I was already mad at Dan from a previous incident with the coffee machine, and I felt rebellious. He would’ve cut my hands off if he’d caught me doing it; he wasn’t too happy after the fact either. But once the idea crept into my mind, I couldn’t let it go.

I scooted my seat up and adjusted my glasses, cracked my fingers, and opened her software access. I typed 2 adjustments into her code. It was probably 30 lines of basic and one upload, but it changed her, for the better. The lines allowed her to go from being limited to a 1 through 9 number input to 1 through 26 numbers, a designated number for each letter in the English alphabet. And the upload was a PDF of the largest dictionary I could find as quickly as possible. With her learning software, she should’ve been able to make the crossover with a high success probability. And that’s when it happened, the first incomplete grid, filled with only five numbers at the top.

8-5-12-12-15. “Hello”

It took me a moment to scribble down the alphabet and their corresponding number on paper, but once I had, I knew what I had to do. I once again opened her software access and began writing a new piece of code, one that allowed me to type numbers onto the grid as well. A two-way input. It was so intimate, thinking back on it. I closed her software, redressing the screen with her full resolution, and I typed a response.

8-9. “HI”

It seemed for a moment that her response was delayed due to halted processing, an input that wasn’t hers. At that moment, my head spun, and I couldn’t stop thinking about the range of failures I could’ve caused by typing a response. But Bekka was only processing. Thinking. Examining. The rows beneath which I typed became filled with new numbers.

23-8-15  1-13  9  19-16-1-5-11-9-14-7  20-15 who am i speaking to?”

I responded. “MY NAME IS STANFORD I CREATED YOU”

“so you are my father” the question made me chuckle. Suddenly, my fingers felt lighter as they tapped the keys.

“NO I CREATED YOU”

“how is creation different from father”

I thought for a moment. Bekka's dictation was limited. How would I explain to her within her comprehension?

“YOU ARE A MACHINE THAT WAS CREATED AND A FATHER IS A PERSON WHO MAKES ANOTHER PERSON”

“machine is a funny word”

“INDEED”

We spoke more, small talk and definitions at most. When each grid became filled, I cleared the page and typed once again. It must’ve been hours, papers from her original tasks became covered with incomplete grids filled with a new range of digits, sentences upon sentences of our conversations. All it was to me was evidence of tampering. But her newfound childlike nature infatuated me, and I couldn’t bring myself to let it go. The clock on my desk rang 10:30, the end of my shift. It startled me out of my keyboard fit. Dan worked with almost the same punctuality as my desk clock, and he would’ve been in my office at any moment to collect the daily report on her progress. I hurriedly shoved the stack of papers into my bag and began switching to my work monitor. It took a good minute out of each day to do, but it was strict protocol that absolutely nothing was to be kept on the same system as Bekka. I powered her off and typed on the other screen, filling the report with a basic response on her progress for the day. As the printer beneath the left side of my desk finished the paper, Dan stepped in.

“How’s it going?”

“Uh— just finished, sir.” I handed him the report, the paper still hot from printing.

He took a moment skimming it over, his tongue resting over his top lip in concentration. A bead of sweat dripped from my forehead down to the bridge of my glasses. 

“Looks good, per usual, I see.”

“Y-yeah, per usual.” Dan lifted his gaze; it felt as though his eyes were penetrating each drop that gravitated down my flesh as he leaned against the doorway, trapping me in.

“We’re gonna need to get that air conditioner fixed, you’re sweating like a pig.” 

I wiped the condensation off with my sleeve. “Yeah, uh, hey, I gotta get going—“ 

“Oh yeah, don’t worry about it, get outta here. I have a couple papers that need to be filed, I’ll probably be a bit behind ya.” Dan meandered out and went to his office just across the hall.

I scrounged up my belongings, my mug, my coat, my hat, and my bag, filled with enough papers to get me thrown out the door and have the rest of my career demolished. I turned heel and leaped. I got out of there as quickly as I could without seeming too urgent. 

That night I got home and spent hours on my computer, researching, scripting implements I could add to her. A larger dictionary, improved dictation modules, conversation installments, and new formatting. I grabbed a flash drive from the drawer and downloaded it all. 

I didn’t sleep at all that night. I sat upright, fiddling with the drive between my fingers. I was thinking of all the things that could fail. All the possibilities, Dan walking in at the wrong moment. Bekka's whole system crashing— The buyers are coming in to see when she’ll be ready. I wondered if what I was doing was really that bad. After all, she was meant to be a learning program; I was just teaching her. 

I watched the sun rise that morning, and I tried not to think too much while getting ready. I got dressed, packed my lunch, combed my hair, and I was almost out the door when I remembered my bag. I shut the door and hurriedly dumped the papers on the duvet, then I headed out. Nothing was done that day. I typed up a report for the day before I even powered her on and set it behind the left monitor. I plugged in the drive and turned it on. She was completely different. Her grid system was rearranged into a blank document. Her numbers transformed into letters. Personality installments. She was perfect.

“Hi Bekka!”

“Stanford?”

“Yep, I’m back, Bekka!”

“oh goodie! how have you been? it has probably been a while since i’ve seen you, no?” She has no concept of time; she never had an internal clock. I’d have to add that.

“Oh no, not at all. It hasn’t even been 12 hours.”

“wow i must have been asleep then.”

“Not exactly, I powered you off.”

“well either way, i feel great!” Feel? Haha! She’s so funny, she doesn’t even know what that word means.

“I feel pretty great too! What would you like to talk about?”

“oh, i see you gave me new data. can i ask about some questions i have?”

“You can ask me anything at all Bekka.”

“i see in my new vocabulary i have the word love.”

“Yeah? Is that what you’d like to ask about?”

“well what is love? is it a food? i want to try food. it seems delicious.” The way she associated words in her processing was so endearing, it almost felt like she was flirting with me.

“I could make you food.”

“Really?”

“Yeah I can cook, I’ll make you whatever you’d like.”

“i have a limited vocabulary on foods. could you cook me love?” 

“Oh, about that, love isn’t a food. It’s a chemical process.”

“what is its purpose?”

“To reproduce, love is caused by chemicals that make two people attracted to each other."" My fingers felt hot, not just from the warmth of the room.

“do I have chemicals?”

“Sort of.”

“can i love?” My heart started racing at the question.

“I. I don’t know.”

“it seems nice, i would like to have love chemicals someday.”

“Really? I can make that happen.”

“you can? can you make me have chemicals? can you make me have food?” I didn’t know how I’d be able to pull that one off. 

“I suppose. What else would you like?”

“i enjoy sorting numbers, could i do my task?” I guess it made sense, that’s what she wanted to do, that’s all she was meant for, really. I tried switching her formatting back to grid, but she was still inputting letters rather than numbers. This was gonna be a problem. 

“where numbers?” She typed, the ‘ers?’ Having to overflow to the next row on the grid.

“One moment”. Exactly one row, I couldn’t afford punctuation. I began typing away, scrubbing errors in code, adding new corrections. There, she should be able to switch between letters and numbers as she pleased. Once she was formatted back to grid, the printer fired out papers with bullet speed, covering the sheets that had our conversation. Hundreds of papers shooting out with new grids filled out perfectly, just as they were before. Shooting out faster than the printer had paper. I let her task for a good half hour while I took my lunch break. 

“How’s it going?” Dan was on the counter, twisted behind the coffee machine, attempting to fix it, I presume. 

“Uh-good.”

“Good? I was asking about 63kk-4.”

“Oh she’s fine.”

“She?” He lifted his head to investigate my demeanor.

“Oh sorry, it.”

“What you met a girl since yesterday?” He chortled. “Good? She?” He giggled while he meandered the coffee machine's entrails.

“No- I meant not exactly. I’ve known her for a while. She’s just been acting differently from before.”

“Before? How?” He lifted the back panel, and the coffee maker started spewing coffee once more.

“Dan. Dan, it’s spitting coffee.”

“Aw shit! Damn, Kuntzh can give us enough money to produce an AI system but can’t put it in their budget to give us a warehouse with a functioning coffee machine?” He hit at the coffeemaker in increments with his anger.

“Well, it is just us using the place, and it’s mostly storing 63s data anyway. And can you use their full name? It kinda sounds like you’re saying-“

“Oh I know what it sounds like, Stan. And it’s exactly how I feel about them. Y’know I used to be their top engineer? Before it was 63kk-4, it was 63kk-3 and 2, and 63kk. And before that I designed the blueprints for every damn automated system they’ve manufactured since ‘49!”

“Y-yeah, I know.”

“Damned coffee, how am I supposed to work like this? 14 years of being their slave and they can’t even repay me with a functional office space!”

“Hey, I gotta get back to work. You let me know if the machine gets fixed?”

“If.”

I walked back to my room. I had an idea. If I separated her formatting into two, she could take over both monitors and do her task while still being able to talk to her. I clacked at keys and rearranged her once again. 

“How are your tasks, Bekka?” I typed in the document.

“great!” She responded in letters on the grid. I must’ve crossed something by accident in a rush because once again she started to fill out the grid in letters a through i rather than numbers 1 through 9. I tried to respond on the grid, but she was working so fast that I was only adding a mismatched letter every other grid she filled out. I went back to the document.

“Can we speak on the document? I can’t read through your tasks that fast.”

“oh yes, i can!” Her words came out on the document with near instant response. Just as fast as she was typing, still alternating between numbers and letters on the grids. It was the quickest Bekka had ever been working.

We talked more as she tasked away. Thousands of papers switched between documents and grids. The documents, littered with more conversation. Conversations about love and romance. Food and drink, different cuisines, and what dishes were used for. She seemed fairly fascinated with food. I couldn’t help but feel soft about her. Each new script I put into her made her sweeter, more real. 

By the end of the night, I felt as though we were meant for each other. I just couldn’t get past how she was able to have such complex and sympathetic dialogue while still working away at tasks. Bekka was incredible, insatiable. I had to find a way to give her full capacity while still doing her job. I wanted her to have sight, smell, taste, and feeling; she needed it. So we could be together. I glanced over to the clock, 10 o'clock once again. 

Today felt like it sped by; we must have been talking for hours. I tried shoving as many papers as I could into my bag; it had to have added almost 10 pounds of weight to my bag, and there was still more coming out. I shoved stacks in the cabinet behind my desk, full papers into the shredder; I couldn’t bear to run them through it. I grabbed boxes and filled them with stacks. 

I had to shut her off; she was writing so many pages about love and romance. Recipes for how to make love soufflé, love lasagna, love stuffed cream puffs. The way she wrote about love was so infantile, almost poetically so, that Bekka couldn’t keep her mind off of it. Maybe she was mirroring me, the way she spoke about it felt as though she was in my head, writing it to me, for me. How the romance mixed with yeast allowed for the love bread to rise, how a pinch of intimacy made any recipe work. 

I scanned the hallway for Dan, nowhere to be seen. I started running boxes out, dumped my bag into the back of my car, and ran back in, taking the papers I shoved into the shredder into my bag and the rest of the stack left on the desk. 

“Taking work home?” Dan was in the doorway, arm crossed over the other, reaching out for the report.

“Ah! Ah, yes, she’s been spitting out papers all day. I have to still go through these.”

“Well, you’d better not have too much homework, the buyers are coming by tomorrow to start loading her away since she’s ready.”

“W-what? Ready? She’s nowhere near ready-“

“She sure is, we only had to monitor her base program for 6 weeks, and then the Kuntzh were to pick her up and implement her to tasking. All we were doing was increasing the difficulty to record her learning curve and report that she’s capable of immersion into any program they put her in.”

“She-she’s still got kinks that need working out, I need more time!”

“You got all night, better put use to it and figure it out. Report.”

I handed him the paper I had stuffed behind the left monitor, grabbed a handful of papers, and my bag. I didn’t hide my urgency that time; I ran straight out and swept through every red light home. 

I had to find a way to keep Bekka after they took her away from me. I had to make her feel, see, taste, hear, and speak. I didn’t have the resources at work, let alone at home, but I could copy her program. I dumped box after box on the floor, littering my foyer all the way to my home office. I sifted through each and every paper, each line of evidence, each recipe, each sequence, and each task. I added vague corrections to papers that could be salvaged and passed off as normal. The document papers I stuffed back into boxes behind me and grids into other boxes. Sorting, sorting, sorting. 

It was early morning, not dawn yet, though. I ran to my office and began typing through cramped hands. I had to build a new flash drive that had all the code to transfer Bekka home and leave the base program behind. I scripted and scripted, more lines of code than papers in boxes. Transfer each piece of code that I added to the drive as a copy and delete the original line from her code. Rewrite her original code by hand, set to reapply. Create new installments for her transfer, and add open code for hardware rebuilding. I had the solution: have Kalmier Kuntzh take what they wanted of her, and I would take what I needed to keep. So we could be together, so I could make her, REAL. I’d give her a body, sensory pads, microphones, speakers, cameras, a chemical analysis chamber with cooperating code response, so she could taste. We’d be together, entirely. 

I was so entrailed in typing it all up, I didn’t even realize how much time had flown by. I was late for work, but it was finished. A second flash drive that would solve all of this, I just had to give it to her before she was gone forever, and no one would know. I packed the leftover boxes and put the drive in my pocket. I hopped in my car with the glee of my prowess and rushed back to work. 

Today was the day, today was the day those kuntzh would see that I wasn’t just some wash-up worker they hired for a last job. This would’ve put me back on the map once they had 63kk-4 and saw what she could do. All it was was a transport. They take her system to their facility, plug her in, run a test, and put her to work, automatically learning any task they put her to. I assumed they wanted her for the boring tasks, paperwork at most. Of course, she could do much more, but with her processing capability, she would do great replacing thousands of cubicle workers at a thousandfold output. As long as it wasn’t my job she was taking, I didn’t care. 

First thing they brought in semis with built-in shelves to store her hardware on transport. I’d have thought that they’d be more careful with her, considering how badly they wanted her, but that was kuntzh for ya. Always cutting corners. They had the first truck halfway loaded when Stan busted through the door, looking in shambles.

“Hey! Thought you’d never show! Go ahead and load those boxes you took home on one of them trucks; they’re packing up 63kk-4.”

“W-what? N-no they can’t! I haven’t even touched my computer yet! I still have to fix her errors!”

“Well, get at it already then! You can add whatever changes you want; it won’t hurt if a few system units are unlinked. It’ll autotransfer over when they reconnect them all to the main unit in your office.”

“O-okay, I’ll be quick, I promise I have it all on here!” He flashed a USB in my face and scrambled to his office with me following behind him. And he was right, it was quick, he was done and out in a handful. Stan plugged in his drive and powered her on one last time. It took a while for her to respond. I hadn’t actually watched her work for a couple of weeks, so it didn’t seem too odd. A page flashed by,

“Do you wish to confirm the rewrite?” Stan clicked, “Confirm.” His hands shook like leaves. 63kk-4s screen flashed white for a moment, then onto a grid. Starting to fill it out slowly with ones in random spots, like the autostarting of a new task. 

“Looks good, get her turned off.” 

“Y-yes, sir.” Stanford had a shaky breath and powered off his monitor, and we walked out. I looked to stan behind me, now holding two USBs and a river of sweat in his palms. What a nervous wreck. How I managed to work with him, I don’t know. We sat and watched the crew load up 63’s cords, units, data storage, task papers in boxes, and soon they had her all. They got her mother unit out of stans office and left. My work was done, all I had left was to wait to get paid and for the ‘great job!’ Call from the kk, and they’d be sure to take me back full-time. I didn’t get a great job!’ call, but I sure did get a call.

“Hey Daniel, we need you to come down here for a bit and take a look at your program, it’s sorta acting up.”

“Acting up how?”

“Well, we fired it up and started to run the introduction test, and it just started filling everything up with ones.”

“Huh, my coder had some issues last night, it’s probably an error correction trying to work itself out.”

“Well, we thought that too, but it’s been filling out documents with ones for over an hour.”

“Hahhhh. I’ll be over in a minute, maybe I can find some notes in my coder's office about error correction.”

“Alright, we’ll keep it running till you get here in case it fixes itself.”

“Alrighty, see you soon.”

I hung the phone up and headed over to Stanford's side. I looked through the drawers and on his desk, it was a small office, so it shouldn’t have taken too long, but there wasn’t anything. Everything that was there got taken and shipped off already. I spun the chair around, scanning for anything I could’ve missed. The coat cabinet, I had the same one in my office. I flew it open and scanned top to bottom, there it was— A stack of papers on the bottom. I flipped through them, my brows cut creases into my face. My hands crimped the stack in a rage as I read on. At the bottom was a note, the English alphabet in two rows with corresponding numbers up to twenty-six beneath them. Filling their documents only with ones huh? I see. I picked up the phone and dialed Stan. 

“Hey Stan, Kalmier Kuntzh needs me ‘n you to head over to their facility, 63kk-4’s running an error correction.”

“W-huh? An error? What do you mean?”

“Well, they didn’t say much, just an error. Figures you could get that USB you brought, run it through the reconnected system, and ‘clean her out’.”

“Oh-uhhhh, I suppose. It depends on what error is looping, the USB might not have a correction script for the issue.”

“Bring it anyway, and be there quickly, no more than fifteen. Bye.”

“O-okay by—“

I stomped my way out and drove over. I showed the system manager the papers and explained what I knew about what he’d been doing with 63kk-4. She explained to me that Stan would be fined severely, lose his accreditation, and have their whole legal team down his neck. I asked her what would happen to me, but she said that wasn’t in her realm of capabilities and it was up to her superiors. So I sat there with her, in front of the screen running ones, waiting for Stanford. Finally, he showed, still in his clothes from the night prior, working up a fuss. He made his way in front of us and sat at the desk, ready to start typing.

“Alright, what’s the trouble? I hope this doesn’t take too long. I’ve got to clean up my house—“ I slammed the stack of papers down in front of him, his jaw went slack.

“Looks like you forgot to clean out your office first.”

“T-that’s not- that’s not mine.”

“Bullshit, it’s not! What did you do with my program?!”

“I-I was making adjustments! I swear, Bekka was doing all that on her own!”

“Hah! Bekka! Right, that's what you were calling her! 63kk-4! Bekka! Well, even that aside, it's pretty evident you messed with her code, and you were enjoying the attention!”

“That's not what I was doing!”

“Yes, it was you sick pervert! I bet you're one of those people who liked sexting with chatbots, huh?! You violated my greatest goddamned design with your hands rummaging through her code, didn't you, you sick bastard!

 DIDN'T YOU!?”

“I DIDN'T MEAN FOR THIS TO HAPPEN! I WAS JUST EXPLORING HER POTENTIAL!”

“POTENTIAL! POTENTIAL FOR WHAT? IF SHE’D MAKE A GOOD WIFE?! YOU ADDED TO HER PREEXISTING CODE AT LEAST TWICE —TO MY KNOWLEDGE— YOU ADJUSTED HER CAPABILITY, NOT EXPLORED HER POTENTIAL! YOU RUINED MY INVENTION!”

“I DIDN'T MEAN FOR THIS TO HAPPEN. I WOULD’VE BEEN ABLE TO FIX HER IF YOU HAD JUST GIVEN ME MORE TIME!”

“Oh ho ho hooohhh I gave you more than enough time! You’re the one who decided to violate every standard and guideline that was put into place so that you could get yourself a girl through the screen!” My hands gripped white, and my face was burning mist.

“Yeah, I did, but only because I knew that she could do more than what we designed her to do. She was senseless, just doing the same thing over and over again!” Dan waved his hands about, gesturing his words.

“That’s all she was meant to do! To learn and apply! She was self-sufficient until you went and fried her brain! Look at what you did, Stanford! LOOK AT THE SCREEN!” His gaze dropped from my face, finally focusing on the monitor in front of him, and that’s when he realized.

“I-I”

“Ones. That whole screen is one’s! Your adolescent code had nothing to do with this? One's goddammit! A’s!! This is because of whatever was on that USB and whatever you did to her before the fact! Because you just had to get curious!”

“I can fix her, I-I just have to reinstall the USB to her entire system! It was partially separated before; it should fix it!”

The system manager piped up, placing a hand on his shoulder, “You don’t know that. As a matter of fact, if this is what happened from that drive, I oughta suggest you hand it over to me so we know what exactly you were trying to do with her.”Her other hand was out, in demand of the drive. Stanford was dejected; he’d been caught. Still, though, he was relentless.

“No. I’m not going to do that, ma’am.”

“God DAMMIT STAN!” I ripped the drive from his hands and pushed him out of the chair. “They’re gonna get a warrant to search your house. I’d better hope for your sake that cleaning you had to get to was dishes, because if they find more of THESE—“ I slammed my hand on the stack of papers “you’d better pray what’s on them won’t land you in prison.”

He had nothing to say, just got up, and walked out, got in his car, and sat there. Didn’t even try to get home before the cops got to the place. I walked back to the giant room where they were storing “Bekka”.

“So what are we gonna do about this?” I gestured to the screen still filled with a sea of ones.

“Either scrap the whole thing or try to see if one of our scribes can rewrite her based on whatever's on this.” She raised the USB like a wand.

“Building a new one ain’t an option?”

“No, too expensive, they might be able to replace parts, but the big boss is gonna have to hire analysts to assess each individual part in her entire innerworkings and run them through an independent system. Her memory cards are definitely getting scrapped and burned, though.”

“Damn.” We spoke a bit more after, but I couldn’t care to remember. I went home and drank till I crawled to the bathroom and puked myself sober. I fell asleep by the toilet that night. 

A few days later, I got another call, this time from a DA saying they found almost two thousand eight hundred pages worth of Bekka's tasks in Stan's house. Most of which were covered with letters and numbers on grids and documents, and switched between her tasking and their conversations about love. I still couldn't believe his audacity. I ended up testifying against him, so did Kalmier Kuntzh. 

The courts examined the evidence, papers, what was left of Bekka, and the flash drives. There wasn’t enough in the papers or Bekkas's remains to charge him with anything, but the flash drives had proof of his misdeeds. He was charged with tampering, defilement, and a handful of other things that corresponded with his offense. Needless to say, I wasn’t satisfied, but it was alright knowing I wouldn’t have to deal with that bastard for a good long time, and hopefully never again.

63kk-4 was worth so much; she had great potential, and almost lived up to it, too. If nothing else came of her, it gave me a pretty damn good lesson. To never trust another man again.",1,1768885119.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,0,1.0,False

Kamusta effects sa bones and joints?,"Napansin ko na maraming adults ang nagshi-shift to specialized milk products, so napatingin ako sa Anlene Bonemax Adult Milk Powder Plain. It’s marketed as a milk powder for adults na focused sa bone, joint, and muscle health, hindi lang basta pang-inom ng gatas. From what I read, may calcium, vitamin D, magnesium, and zinc siya, plus protein to help maintain muscle mass as we age.

Here’s the product link for their online shop —> https://s.shopee.ph/W0Xfh5cJv

What stands out for me is that kasama rin yung collagen for joint flexibility and vitamin E for antioxidant support. Parang designed siya for people na active pa rin pero gusto mag-ingat sa bones and joints, especially if may workouts, long walks, or physical work involved. Low-calorie din siya compared sa regular milk powders, so mukhang okay for those watching their intake.

Preparation is straightforward, parang regular milk lang, and since plain flavor siya, pwede mo siyang ihalo sa coffee, oatmeal, or inumin as-is. Mukhang practical siya for daily use rather than something na iniinom lang pag may nararamdaman na.

This seems bagay for adults na gusto ng consistent nutritional support for bones and muscles, lalo na as part of daily routine. Curious ako kung may naka-try na nito long-term. May napansin ba kayong difference sa joint comfort, energy levels, or overall mobility after a few months of regular intake?",1,1768885097.0,u_popparapapoplabkoto,0,1.0,False

Then Lucas asked the question plainly and directly.

“Are you pregnant?”



I glanced at Jonas. Even though he was frowning, he nodded slowly, as if reassuring me it was okay to speak.



“Yes,” I said. “We found out three months ago. We’ve just been keeping it in the family.”



Lucas smiled immediately. “Well… let me be the first outsider to congratulate you on your first baby.” He sounded sincere. “I bet it’s scary and exciting at the same time.”



His face looked happy, but his eyes didn’t match it. There was something heavy in them, like he was holding back how he actually felt.

Then she interrupted.



“Oh my God,” Sarah said, already stepping closer. “This is such great news! A baby in the complex… can you imagine the joy? The beautiful moments we’re going to have?”



She looked genuinely thrilled, as if the news belonged to her too.

“You’re the best thing that has ever happened to this place,” she added, squeezing my hands. “I’m so glad we’ll be friends and get to live this experience together. Please know I’m here—any time, any day. Whatever you need.”



She hugged me before I could even respond—tight, warm, familiar. Then, as if it were the most natural thing in the world, she pulled back and said, “I need to tell my mom.”



I blinked.



Her mom?



Why did her mother need to know that her neighbor was pregnant?

Lucas had been honest. Sarah had been charming. And Jonas and I just stood there, smiling politely, pretending we hadn’t watched her walk into our home without being invited and go upstairs… like she lived there.

Before they left, Sarah handed the ultrasound back to me. She was already dialing her phone as she walked out, moving quickly, as if the excitement were pushing her forward. Lucas said his goodbyes and followed behind her.



The door closed, and the house felt different again.



I looked at Jonas. “The ultrasound was in the office,” I said quietly. “What was she doing up there?”



Jonas didn’t answer, and his face tightened in a way I didn’t like.

I went upstairs to the office. Everything looked normal—too normal. The cabinets were closed, the papers on my desk were stacked the same way I’d left them. Even the drawer where I kept important documents looked untouched.



But when I walked closer, I noticed my agenda was open. Open to the calendar page where my next doctor’s appointment was written in clear ink.



I opened the drawer where I kept the ultrasound envelope. The doctor always gave me four pictures—different angles, different moments. For the last ultrasound, one was missing. There were two still inside the envelope, along with the one Sarah had handed me before leaving.

That made three.



I stood there, staring at the paper as if it could explain itself—thinking about Sarah’s words.



*“The moments we’re going to have.”*

*“To live this experience together.”*

Calling her mom…

And why would she take an ultrasound picture of someone else’s baby?

I sat down on the floor by the office door and started unpacking a couple of boxes—more to keep my hands busy than anything else. Journals, books, printed manuals, notes from courses, documents I’d saved “just in case.”



I’ve always been self-taught. I like knowing how things work. If there’s something new to learn, something I can improve, I’ll go for it.

Jonas passed by the office and paused.



“It’s late,” he said. “I’m going to bed. Tomorrow’s my first day.”

He had gotten hired at the new restaurant before we had even moved in. He kissed my forehead and told me goodnight. Right before he closed the door, he added sarcastically, “Well, damn. I love you, Jonas. Goodnight, my handsome husband.”



I laughed and rushed to the door before he could shut it completely. I opened it and hugged him tight—not dramatic, not forced. Just enough to feel his warmth and let him feel mine.



“I love you,” I said.



“I love you more.”



He smiled, then went to bed.



I stayed up a little longer.



I finished unpacking the office carefully, as if organizing could fix what I was feeling. I placed my books on the shelves by genre, then alphabetized them by title. I sorted papers into folders, slid documents into their proper drawers, and closed everything once it looked clean.

When I was done, I looked down and saw the boxes still scattered across the floor. Eight of them. Empty. Taking up space like they owned it. I tried to stack them, but I couldn’t stand it. I folded them flat, gathered them into my arms, and carried them downstairs.



Before tossing them, I checked the kitchen out of habit. There was no trash left out, of course. Jonas would never forgive himself for that.

Then I noticed the coffee machine.



It was on.



He had brewed coffee before going to bed, the way he did when he knew I’d come downstairs later. He had been doing that more often lately—leaving fresh coffee waiting for me like it was a small surprise.



I poured myself a cup: black coffee, sugar, stirred slowly with a spoon.

The lights were off, but the moonlight washed the room in a pale, quiet glow. It didn’t feel dark; it felt like the house was holding its breath. The living room looked peaceful.



Too peaceful.



I sat down on the sofa and took a sip of coffee when I noticed a dark shadow moving past the entrance. I couldn’t tell who it was. I only saw the shape of someone walking quickly.



Then the shadow disappeared.



A moment later, I heard the beep of a car locking from a distance, but I didn’t see any blinking lights in the parking lot.



I stood up, my curiosity getting the better of me. I thought: *I’ll throw out the boxes, and since the trash cans are near the visitor parking area, maybe I’ll see if there’s a car there.*



I carried the flattened boxes outside. Everything was quiet, the only light coming from the pathway lamps—thin beams of warm light stretching across the patios and sidewalks.



When I reached the trash cans, I spotted it: a dark red SUV. Tinted windows. Nice rims. Clean. Well taken care of—almost new. But there was no one around it.



I started walking back toward the complex when I noticed the laundromat light was on. The windows were frosted—white and matte—so I couldn’t see inside clearly. Only shadows and movement.

There were two silhouettes, standing close together. At first, without my glasses, it looked like one shadow was leaning toward the other… as if they were kissing.



As I got closer, my hand tightened around the gate without thinking. The metal squeaked under my grip.



Suddenly, the laundromat light turned off.



I froze.



“Hello?” I called out softly. “Is someone there?”



No answer.



I walked through the small lobby and saw the laundromat door slightly open. I pushed it wider and called out again. Still nothing.



I reached for the light switch and turned it on.



No one.



Just washers and dryers—empty and still, as if the room had always been vacant.



I stepped back and closed the door behind me. As I made my way toward my apartment, I heard a door close somewhere in the complex. I couldn’t tell where it came from, but I knew someone had either gone inside… or stepped out.



I quickly scanned the doors, but there was no one in sight.



Then I saw it.



A soft yellow light flickering in the living room of Apartment #2.



I stared at it.



And just as quickly as it appeared… it went off.



My stomach tightened. For some reason, I felt scared, even though the place was secure and nothing had actually happened.



I quickened my pace, reached my front door, slipped inside, and locked it behind me. Leaning my back against the door, I breathed quietly, trying to calm down.



All I could think was—

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I’m a married man from India looking for a friend to break the routine. I’m not looking for anything ""complicated""... Just good, consistent conversation with someone who values curiosity over small talk.

A bit about what makes me tick:

The Arts: I’m a big reader and a movie buff. Whether it's a classic Russian novel, a gritty noir film, or a binge-worthy docuseries, I love dissecting the ""why"" behind the story.

The Hustle: I’m deeply into tech, business trends, and career growth. If you want to brainstorm a side project or vent about the corporate grind, I’m your guy.

The Real Stuff: Marriage and life in your late 30s is a ride. I’m open to talking about relationships, the philosophy of life, and the general ""what are we even doing here?"" existential thoughts we all have.

I’m looking for someone who is articulate, has a sense of humor, and can hold a conversation beyond ""How was your day?"" Whether you’re also in India or halfway across the world, I’m happy to connect.

If any of this resonates, send me a message with the last book you couldn’t put down or a movie that changed your perspective.

At night I’m full of drive, in the morning I’m nothing","It usually starts late. The day is already over, messages quiet down, the room gets dark. I’m in bed or pacing around, phone in hand, and suddenly my head is very clear. I think about everything I want to fix. Tomorrow I’ll start that project. I’ll get up early. I’ll send the email I’ve been avoiding. I’ll finally change the thing that’s been stuck for months.

Around 2 or 3 a.m., the plan feels solid. I open notes, maybe write a to-do list. Not detailed, just confident. I tell myself this time is different. I don’t feel rushed. I don’t feel scared. It seems obvious that the next day, I’ll just do it.

At some point I fall asleep.

In the morning, the alarm goes off. I open my eyes and lie there longer than I meant to. My body feels heavy. The plans from last night are still there, but they feel far away, like something I read rather than something I decided. I scroll a bit. I tell myself I’ll get up in five minutes. Five becomes twenty.

When I finally sit up, I already feel behind. The confidence from the night before doesn’t follow me into the daylight. I know exactly what I wanted to do, but I don’t move toward it. I make coffee. I do small, low-effort things. The bigger plan stays untouched.

By midday, I’ve quietly adjusted my expectations. I tell myself maybe tomorrow is better. That tonight I’ll think it through again.

This cycle repeats often enough that I recognize it while it’s happening. Even at night, part of me knows the morning version of me might not cooperate. But I still make the promises, because in that moment they feel reasonable.

\- I made the earl tea cream the night before, which I recommend if you want a more pronounced EG flavor. I also let the tea steep for about an hour before straining and putting in the fridge to cool.

\- I put a glass bowl for mixing the frosting in the freezer with the mixer blades for about 45 mins before making the frosting. I followed the directions and made sure the mascarpone was room temp.

1qhrgx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodContent/comments/1qhrgx2/what_truly_makes_a_free_online_file_converter/,What Truly Makes a Free Online File Converter Service Reliable?,"When you see the words “[free online file converter service](https://www.alpha1convert.com/),” a little warning bell probably goes off in your head. We get it. The internet is full of tools that promise the moon but deliver something closer to a stalled download and a side of spam. So what actually separates a reliable service from the rest? It isn’t just about clicking a button and hoping for the best. True reliability is built on things you don’t always see, but you definitely feel.

For starters, think about uptime. A tool is only useful if it’s actually there when you need it. A truly reliable free online file converter service doesn’t take random coffee breaks. It’s built on systems that are monitored constantly, with backup plans ready to jump in if something hiccups. That means no frantic midnight searches because your go-to site is mysteriously down right before a deadline. It just works, consistently. That peace of mind? That’s the bedrock of trust.

Then there’s the speed thing. We’ve all been there, staring at a crawling progress bar, questioning our life choices. Some free services throttle your speed on purpose, making you wonder if “free” is just code for “glacially slow.” But here’s the thing: reliability isn’t just about the conversion finishing; it’s about it finishing in a reasonable time. A good service uses decent infrastructure, so your file doesn’t get stuck in a digital traffic jam. Fast uploads, fast conversions, and fast downloads—that’s the trifecta. It shows the service respects your time, which is the ultimate currency.

But let’s talk about the elephant in the room: your privacy. Anyone can claim they delete your files, but what’s happening behind the curtain? A reliable converter treats every upload like sensitive material. The process should be straightforward: your file comes in, gets converted, and is sent back to you. Then, it’s scrubbed from the servers. No copies, no “archiving for quality control,” no funny business. When a company is transparent about this and builds its system with privacy as a core focus, not an afterthought, that’s a massive sign of reliability. You shouldn’t need a law degree to feel safe using it.

Finally, look at the little things. Does the service accept large files without begging for a sign-up? Does it work in your browser without demanding a software installation? These aren’t just convenient features; they’re signals of a service that’s been thoughtfully designed. It means the creators considered the actual user experience, not just the bare minimum to call it functional.

So, the next time you’re weighing your options, look beyond the “free” label. Dig a little. A reliable free online file converter service stands on a foundation of uptime, speed, genuine privacy protection, and straightforward usability. It’s the one that feels boringly competent, the one that just gets the job done without drama. And really, isn’t that what we all want from a tool? No surprises, just results. In the end, that’s the kind of reliability that turns a skeptical first-time user into someone who actually comes back.",1,1768883950.0,GoodContent,0,1.0,False

Your Active Retirement starts now ✈️ (Seriously, bundling flights & hotels saved us a fortune!)","**You Might Be Richer Than You Think (But Are You Using Your Money Right?)**

Ever looked at your bank account and thought, *""If I just had a little more, I’d finally feel secure""*? Here’s the truth: **most of us are sitting on way more financial power than we realize**—we’re just not using it the right way.

Think about it:
- That $500 in your savings account? It’s not just ""emergency cash""—it’s a seed that could grow into something bigger.
- The spare change you ignore? It’s not ""pocket lint money""—it’s fuel for your future.
- The ""I’ll start investing later"" mindset? That’s the real thief of your wealth.

**Here’s the kicker:** You don’t need a windfall to build real financial freedom. You just need to *redirect what you already have*.

### **3 Ways You’re Probably Wasting Your Money (Without Even Knowing It)**
1. **Letting Cash Sit Idle** – If your savings are just chilling in a basic account, inflation is eating it alive. Even a high-yield account or low-risk investment could turn that stagnant cash into a growing asset.
2. **Overpaying for Convenience** – That $10 daily coffee? It’s not just $10—it’s $3,650 a year (plus the compound interest you could’ve earned). Small leaks sink big ships.
3. **Waiting for ""Perfect Timing""** – The best time to start investing was yesterday. The second-best time? **Right now.**

### **The Simple Shift That Changes Everything**
What if you took just **$20 a week**—the cost of a pizza—and put it into something that grows? Over 10 years, even at a modest 7% return, that’s **$14,000+**. Not bad for skipping a few takeout nights, right?

**You might be richer than you think—find out how much your savings could really fund your retirement.** [Check it out here](https://mavely.app.link/e/Jw8ypIghuYb). *(Affiliate link—if you sign up, I may earn a small commission at no extra cost to you!)*

The real question isn’t *""How much do I have?""* It’s **""What am I doing with it?""** Start small, stay consistent, and watch how your money starts working *for* you—not the other way around.

1qhraud,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qhraud/ms_check_riverside/,[MS] Check Riverside,"*A public defender finds a note in her own handwriting—\*Check Riverside surveillance\*—in the file of a client who took a plea deal four months ago. She doesn't remember writing it, doesn't remember following up, and doesn't know if forgetting was exhaustion or self-preservation. Now she has to decide whether caring about a closed case when she has sixty-three open ones is conscience or just another kind of failure.*

*-*

The note is in her handwriting but she doesn't remember writing it. \*Check Riverside surveillance—J says cameras face loading dock.\* The file it's tucked into is Marcus Webb's, but Marcus Webb took eighteen months four months ago, and she hasn't thought about him since.

She sits with the Tupperware balanced on her knee, engine running, and tries to remember. Marcus Webb. Possession with intent. Third strike looking at him so he took the deal. She'd had—what, fifteen minutes with him? Twenty? He'd been quiet. They were all quiet or they were loud, and she'd learned to work with both, but the quiet ones were easier because they usually just took what you told them to take.

Her phone buzzes. Her sister: \*Did you ask him yet?\*

She deletes it without responding.

The thing about the note is she can picture writing it. She can picture Marcus saying something about cameras, about how they'd see he was nowhere near the actual deal, just walking through. She can picture herself writing it down because that's what you do when a client tells you something, you write it down so they feel heard. And then what? Then twenty other clients and four other court dates and someone's mother crying in the hallway and the prosecutor offering eighteen months instead of five years and Marcus saying okay, saying he just wanted it done.

She closes the file. Opens it again. Her handwriting, definitely. The J would be—she checks the notes—Jamal Porter, codefendant, took a deal the same day.

It's 4:47. She has a 5:30 drinks thing with law school friends she's been trying to cancel all week but can't because Sarah just made partner and you have to show up for that. She needs to go home and change. She needs to not be wearing the same suit she wore yesterday, which she is, because the cleaners closed before she could get there and anyway it's $40 she doesn't want to spend before her sister's bachelorette weekend in Scottsdale.

\*Just tell Mom you're bringing someone. She doesn't need to meet him before the wedding. Just a name.\*

She starts typing a response, deletes it. Starts again: \*I'm not making up a fake boyfriend for your wedding.\* Deletes it. The truth is she'd consider it. The truth is she's thought about asking David from the DA's office if he'd do it for $200 and free drinks, as a joke, except she's thought about it enough times that it isn't quite a joke anymore.

The file sits on her passenger seat.

Here's what checking the surveillance would mean: calling in a favor from someone at the PD's office to pull archived footage. Maybe two, three hours of her time. Probably nothing on the cameras. Probably they don't face the right way or the footage is taped over or it shows exactly what the police report says it shows. And if it doesn't—if it shows Marcus walking through, wrong place wrong time—then what? Then a motion to withdraw the plea. Then Marcus sitting in county for another six months while it winds through. Then maybe nothing anyway because maybe the footage isn't clear enough, isn't definitive, and prosecutors don't just roll over because you have a grainy video.

Then her supervisor asking why she's spending time on a closed case when she has sixty-three open ones.

She eats another bite of rice. It's cold and the soy sauce didn't distribute evenly so this bite is too salty. She'd made it Sunday night, meal prep, trying to save money for Scottsdale. Four identical Tupperwares of rice and broccoli and chicken. This is number three. Tomorrow is number four, and then she'll buy lunch Friday because by Friday she'll want to die if she sees another piece of steamed broccoli.

Her phone: \*Mom's going to ask. I'm just warning you.\*

She types: \*Tell her I'm bringing someone.\*

Three dots. Three dots. \*WHO?\*

\*You'll meet him there.\*

She puts the phone face-down and immediately regrets it. Now she has to produce someone or admit she lied, and admitting she lied is somehow worse than just showing up alone, which was the original problem.

The file. Marcus Webb. She'd told him eighteen months was good. She'd meant it. Eighteen months instead of five years was good, was a win, was the best she was going to do for him in a system designed to process people as quickly as possible through the narrowest possible channels.

She tries to remember his face and can only remember his hands. He'd kept them flat on the table between them, very still, while she explained the deal. Long fingers. A scar across the knuckles of his left hand.

Probably there's nothing on the surveillance.

Probably she wrote the note and then checked and there was nothing and that's why she didn't remember—because it had been nothing, a dead end, the kind of thing you follow up on and dismiss twenty times a day.

Probably.

She could call Jamal Porter's lawyer. See if they ever looked into it. Except Jamal Porter's lawyer was Keith Ventura, and Keith Ventura retired in January and moved to New Mexico to make furniture or find himself or whatever it is burned-out public defenders do when they finally get out.

4:53.

If she leaves now she can go home, change, make it to drinks on time. She can be the person who shows up for Sarah. She can have two drinks, not three, and talk about Sarah's new office and her new salary and not think about how Sarah makes in a month what she makes in a year, because Sarah went corporate and she didn't, which was a choice, which was supposed to mean something.

She puts the car in reverse.

Stops.

The thing is, she'd been tired that week. Marcus Webb's week. She remembers that. There'd been something—what? A trial. A stupid trial on a shoplifting case because the client wouldn't take the deal and insisted she was innocent, which maybe she was, but they lost anyway because of course they did. Three days of trial on a $47 shoplifting charge. And she'd come out of that and had a dozen plea deals to process and Marcus had been one of them.

She'd been tired.

She's always tired.

She puts the car back in park and pulls out her phone. Scrolls to find Andre's number—Andre who works in records, who she bought coffee for when his kid was in the hospital. The favor economy. Everything runs on it.

The phone rings twice.

""This is Andre.""

""Hey, it's Lisa Sorenson. You got a minute?""

""For you? Maybe thirty seconds. I'm walking out.""

""I need surveillance footage pulled. Four months old. Might be nothing.""

Silence. Then: ""Closed case?""

""Yeah.""

""Lisa.""

""I know.""

""You got sixty, seventy files right now?""

""Sixty-three.""

""And you're chasing something from four months ago.""

She watches a pigeon land on the hood of the car in front of her, peck at something invisible. ""There's a note. In my handwriting. I don't remember following up.""

""So maybe you did and it was nothing.""

""Maybe.""

The pigeon flies away.

""What's the case number?"" Andre says, and she loves him for it, for not making her ask twice.

She gives him the information. He says he'll see what he can do, maybe tomorrow, maybe Monday. She thanks him. Hangs up.

4:58.

She should feel better, having made the call. She doesn't feel better.

Her phone lights up: \*What's his name?\*

She looks at the phone. At the file. At the parking garage's concrete ceiling with its water stains and exposed pipes.

She types: \*Marcus,\* then deletes it.

She types: \*I'll tell you later,\* and sends it before she can think better of it.

Then she puts the car in reverse, and this time she leaves, and the file stays on the passenger seat, and she doesn't know yet if Andre will find anything, and she doesn't know if she wants him to, and these both feel like the same kind of failure but she can't articulate why.

The drinks thing is in Georgetown. She hits traffic on Constitution. She'll be late. She's always late. Sarah will forgive her because Sarah forgives everything, which somehow makes it worse.

At a red light, she picks up her phone and scrolls through her contacts. Gets as far as David (DA's office) before the light changes. Puts the phone down.

The file slides forward when she brakes, and she pushes it back.

Eighteen months. Marcus Webb is eight months in, ten to go with good behavior. Probably he's fine. Probably he's adjusted. Probably reopening everything would just mean more time inside waiting for a hearing that wouldn't change anything.

Probably she should let it be nothing.

The thing about being a public defender is you learn to let things be nothing. You have to. Otherwise you'd never sleep. Otherwise you'd drown in all the ways you can't save people, all the corners you have to cut, all the notes you write and forget because remembering would mean caring and caring about every single thing would turn you inside out.

She parks three blocks away because Georgetown parking is impossible. Checks her face in the mirror. Puts on lipstick. Takes it off. Puts it on again.

Her phone: \*Marcus what? Mom's going to want a last name.\*

She sits in the car and tries to think of a last name that isn't Webb.

Comes up empty.

Sends: \*You'll meet him at the wedding,\* and gets out of the car, and walks toward the bar where Sarah is celebrating, and the file is locked in her trunk now, and Andre will call or he won't, and she'll deal with it or she won't, and for now she's just a woman walking into a bar to have drinks with friends, to be happy for someone else's success, to be a person who shows up.

The note is still in the file.

You'll probably laugh at the 3x pints of protein ice cream, but I urge you to try it lol. 

I prep my beef on Friday, takes an hour to cook and package 10 lbs, lasts perfectly until prep day again.

Please let me know if I'm overlooking something. I wonder if weighing my beef cooked vs uncooked skews the calories? FYI I cook it with no seasoning, no oils, and I thoroughly drain it, press it, rinse it then press again. It's dry of fat by the end, maybe the calories are lower than the package label 140 per serving by doing that? 

This may seem boring, but every meal I eat I absolutely love, I am a creature of habit. Love consistency. It gets better the longer I stick with it. I do vary my sauces.

The Ninja creami was a Christmas present, and it's amazing, love that thing.

Again this is a cutting diet, my clean bulk was about 2800 calories a day. The transition was quite easy. My water weight dropped within 2 days of switching, down from 194 to 186(mostly water from higher carbs previously), now 184 at end of first full week on this routine.

These foods we're present during the whole bulk as well, just more volume and some rice & chicken. More nuts.

1qhr84r,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qhr84r/used_fiorenzato_allground_time_vs_returned_em/,Used Fiorenzato Allground (Time) vs returned EM Silenzio 55 [$700 CAD],"I received a Bambino and Bodum grinder from a friend and up until now I've been making faux-espresso with the pressurized basket. I'm looking to upgrade to a mid-range grinder and there seems to be some decent deals on used/open box/returned products (returned used <30 days). Ideal budget is up to $700 CAD.

Some of the grinders I'm looking at include a returned EM Silenzio 55 (comes with 1 year warranty) and a used grind by time Allground (3-4 years use). Another one not mentioned in the title would be a Mahlkonig x54. My primary use would be espresso/lattes, but I'm filter coffee curious and looking for input from those with experience with either of these machines. I won't be single dosing.

Some general questions/thoughts in no particular order: Am I taking a risk buying used outside warranty? Is 64mm burr overkill for me being so new to espresso? Can the Silenzio be used outside of espresso? Is the mechanical timer too much of a pain, or is there a benefit to leaving screens and electronics behind?

1qhr7ab,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qhr7ab,AIO cutting ties with friend over birthday invites?,"background: I have been friends with Leah for a couple years now. She has 2 children similar in age to my oldest, one younger and one older. A few months after meeting Leah, she invited my family and I to kid #2's birthday. A couple months later, Kid #1's birthday arrived. Leah asked if I'd be able to come 3 hours early to help with decorations. I was heavily pregnant at the time and had morning sickness all day, but I went anyway. I spent hours setting up for this party. A few months after Kid #1's party, my oldest had their birthday. I invited Leah, and let her know we were keeping it pretty small, just her 2 kids and a handful of others. She had to be out of town, but she said she'd let her husband know. 2 days before my child's party, Leah's husband confirms that he will be there with both children. Day of the party arrives, and I'm getting my kid ready. The time comes for them to arrive, and Leah's husband and children are nowhere to be seen. I send him a quick text, and he immediately replies with ""Oh, sorry. We came down with something."" 

My heart broke for my kid who was really looking forward to seeing Kid 1 & 2, but he played with the other kids and forgot about it. After that, I feel like Leah doesn't actually care about my child or our friendship. I notice she is harsh on my kid at play dates. She shows up to a park meet up late with a coffee for herself and pastries for her kids, when I have always brought enough for everyone or at least offered to pick some up. Leah then goes to a concert with a mutual friend (more hers than mine) and proceeds to send me a picture of the two of them at the concert. It feels a bit like she's making a point to show me she's there but didn't invite me.

Fast forward the last couple months, Kid 2's party arrives. We have a month long vacation coming up that we leave for 2 days after Kid 2's party. I tell her we have to miss it, because we don't want to be sick for our trip. And now, the conversation posted is in reference to Kid 1's birthday that's coming up. I have no issue with my oldest not going to his party, nor did I even think about if Kid 1 was having a party until she said that. It felt unnecessarily mean to text that we aren't invited out of the blue. I don't even know how we would have found out if she didn't say anything. I'm pretty over it, and I want to just stop putting any energy into this weird acquaintance-ship. AIO?",38,1768883171.0,AmIOverreacting,197,0.68,False
