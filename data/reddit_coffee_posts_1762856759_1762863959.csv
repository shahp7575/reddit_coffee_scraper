I’m doing some research on remote work for my dissertation and I’m really interested in the *rituals* people use to create boundaries or structure in their day.

For example - do you have a small routine that helps you “arrive” at work even though you’re at home? Maybe it’s making a specific coffee, taking a walk before logging on, lighting a candle, or even changing clothes.

I’d love to hear what helps you transition in and out of work mode, and whether you feel these little rituals affect your focus, mood, or overall work-life balance.

Thanks in advance to anyone who shares !",1,1762863793.0,remoteworking,1,1.0,False

🔥 When you’re engaged to the perfect man… but his best friend awakens something you can’t ignore | NALA: PART 1 AND 2","Hey everyone, I’m Elo — I create cinematic African stories on my YouTube channel Storytime with Elo.

“Nala” is a modern love drama about a young lawyer torn between safety and passion. It’s rich with culture, emotion, and messy choices.

 

**NALA: PART 1 – THE RIGHT THING**

Nairobi pulsed beneath the late afternoon sun, restless and alive. Matatus rattled past, their horns sharp and insistent, painted with wild colours and faces of pop stars. Hawkers called out in rapid bursts, waving packets of roasted groundnuts, belts, and knock-off sunglasses at anyone who made eye contact. The air carried a mix of roasted maize, exhaust, and the metallic tang left behind by a light drizzle.

Nala Mwende threaded her way along Kenyatta Avenue with measured steps, her heels sharp against the pavement. She carried herself with a deliberate grace, her back straight, her chin high, as though the chaos of the city would never dare touch her. Her cocoa-toned skin caught the glow of the dipping sun, her braids pulled into a tight, high bun that sharpened her features into something elegant, even untouchable.

From the outside, Nala was everything a woman was supposed to be: ambitious, disciplined, in control. Twenty-eight years old, law degree in her pocket, internship at a respected firm, fiancé with a future so stable and polished her parents boasted about him to neighbours. She had built her life like a meticulously balanced argument—logical, tidy, correct.

But beneath that veneer, something restless lived inside her.

For years, she had been the girl who always did the right thing: studying late into the night while her friends were out dancing, saying no to wild detours, standing by David through the gruelling years of med school. She had given so much of herself to duty, to responsibility, to what was expected, that she sometimes wondered what was left for her.

David Otieno. Her fiancé. He was kind, dependable, adored by her family. He was the very definition of “a good man.” And she loved him, in a steady, careful way. Yet love with David was like the Nairobi traffic on a Monday morning: predictable, unmoving, a line of cars that stretched forever without surprise. Nala and David shared a modest apartment on State House Road. It was close enough to the hospital for David to run back between shifts, and spacious enough for Nala to carve out a study corner with her law books. Their families had never been told—they wouldn’t have approved. Her mother had once said cohabiting before marriage was “a curse you invite yourself.” David’s parents were equally old-fashioned. But they had been together five years, engaged for one, and practicality had quietly won.

On the surface, their life was neat. Two mugs hanging on hooks in the kitchen, a soft blue throw on the couch, a small balcony where they sometimes drank tea together at night. It was safe. Predictable. But lately, safe felt suffocating. Safe.

And safety, Nala was beginning to admit, had grown suffocating.

The thought was dangerous, and she knew it. So she buried it beneath the rhythm of her heels and the curve of her practiced smile.

At Nala’s parental home, the air always smelled faintly of boiled maize and bleach. Her mother insisted on scrubbing every corner until the house gleamed, as though cleanliness alone could ward off misfortune. Mama Mwende was a woman with opinions as sharp as her cheekbones: practical, firm, the kind of mother who saw sacrifice as a badge of honour. To her, David was not just a man; he was proof that all her years of labour, saving and praying, had borne fruit.

“Eh, Nala,” Mama said one evening, adjusting the scarf tied around her head as she stirred a pot on the stove. “That man will make you a doctor’s wife. Do you know what that means? Respect. Security. A name in society. You are blessed, my daughter.”

Blessed. The word hung heavy in the kitchen, caught between the steam and the clatter of the wooden spoon.

Her father, Baba Mwende, was different. Where Mama sharpened, Baba softened. He was tall, slightly stooped now, his palms calloused from years of factory shifts. He had the gentlest eyes Nala had ever known, but they carried expectations too—quiet, heavy ones.

“Your mother is right,” he said from his chair, folding the day’s newspaper. “I see how David looks at you. He is steady. A man must be steady, Nala. The rest comes and goes, but steadiness lasts.”

She smiled dutifully, nodding at the right times, but inside, something coiled tighter.

Being an only child meant there was no one else to absorb the dreams her parents pinned on her. No one else to distract them, to divide the weight. It was all on her shoulders: the hope of comfort in their old age, the promise of respectability, the pride of having raised a daughter who chose wisely.

And choosing wisely, of course, meant David.

David, who brought her mother pineapples after his hospital shifts. David, who helped her father carry water buckets when the taps ran dry. David, who sat in their living room with such ease it felt as if he had always belonged to them.

Nala watched it all with a careful smile, folding laundry as her mother praised him, listening as her father marvelled at his discipline. They saw a future of certainty. But she—she sometimes saw a cage, painted in the warm colours of approval.

If her parents were the voice of duty, Miriam was the voice of mischief.

They had met in law school, thrown together in a study group. Where Nala lived by color-coded notes and late nights at the library, Miriam breezed in with braids dyed honey-blonde, oversized earrings, and a laugh that could rattle the walls. She had a sharp wit, a habit of skipping classes to chase “networking opportunities,” and a knack for coaxing Nala out of her rigid shell.

One Saturday afternoon, they sat at a café in Kilimani, the clatter of cups and smell of spiced tea swirling around them. Miriam sipped her cappuccino and leaned back, eyes dancing.

“So,” she said, drawing out the word, “how’s life with Nairobi’s most eligible doctor-to-be? Are we still swooning at bedtime stories about anatomy?”

Nala rolled her eyes, stirring her tea. “David is… good.”

“Good,” Miriam repeated with mock solemnity. “Good is how you describe tea that’s lukewarm or a dress that doesn’t itch. You’ve been with him five years, Nala. I want fireworks, not ‘good.’”

“You don’t understand,” Nala countered. “He’s steady. He cares. My parents adore him. That matters.”

“Of course it matters,” Miriam said, waving her spoon. “But since when is marriage supposed to be a group project with your parents? You’re the one who has to wake up next to him forever.” She leaned forward, lowering her voice. “And honestly? You sound… bored.”

Nala bristled, though the word struck a little too close. “I’m not bored. I’m just… focused. Law is demanding. Life is demanding.”

Miriam smirked, unbothered. “Focused is fine. But don’t confuse sacrifice with happiness. You deserve both.” She took another sip, then added slyly, “Besides, if a fine, dangerous stranger walked in right now and looked at you like you were oxygen, would you still call David ‘good’?”

Nala laughed despite herself, shaking her head. “You’re impossible.”

“And you,” Miriam said with a grin, “are too careful. One day, life will throw you a curve, and I can’t wait to see what you do.”

Nala didn’t reply. She only smiled faintly, pushing her spoon through her tea. Miriam didn’t know it, but that curve was already on its way.

A few days after her coffee with Miriam, David came home carrying a bag of groceries, his tie loosened after a long hospital shift. He smelled faintly of antiseptic and cologne, a combination that had become his signature.

He kissed her cheek in passing and began unloading vegetables onto the counter. “We’re having company tomorrow,” he said matter-of-factly, handing her a bundle of spinach.

“Company?” she asked, raising a brow.

“Jabari.” His face brightened. “You’ve heard me talk about him since forever. My best friend. He’s finally back from the UK. I can’t wait for you to meet him.”

Nala nodded, stirring a pot on the stove. David had told her stories of his childhood friend many times—football matches that stretched past sunset, wild teenage escapades, promises of brotherhood sealed long ago. To Nala, Jabari had always been a character in David’s past, nothing more.

The following evening, Nala set the table, adjusting the cutlery twice though it hardly needed it. She wore a simple black dress, her hair pulled into a neat bun. David moved around the kitchen, humming under his breath, happier than she had seen him in weeks.

When the doorbell rang, David’s grin spread wide. He hurried to open it.

And there he was.

Jabari stepped into the room with a presence that seemed to shift the air itself. He was taller than she expected, broad-shouldered, his chocolate-toned skin gleaming under the light. His eyes—dark, intense, flecked with amber—lingered on her just a second too long before he broke into a grin and embraced David in a clap of brotherhood.

“Look at you,” David laughed, holding him at arm’s length. “The same troublemaker, just in a suit now.”

They both chuckled, their bond effortless, old as time. Nala smiled politely, offering her hand when David introduced them.

“This is Nala,” David said proudly. “My fiancée.”

Her hand slid into Jabari’s. His grip was warm, firm, deliberate. Their eyes met, and something sharp shot through her chest—unexpected, unsettling.

“Finally,” Jabari said, his voice smooth, low, threaded with Swahili warmth. “The woman who’s tamed him.” His lips curved, not quite a smile, not quite a tease.

Dinner began politely enough. David spoke animatedly about rotations and exams, his hands moving as he told stories from the ward. Jabari listened, interjecting with questions, but every so often, his gaze drifted back to Nala. She felt it like a touch, even when she focused on her plate.

At one point, she rose to fetch more water from the kitchen. When she returned, Jabari’s eyes followed her movements with quiet intensity. She ignored it, but her pulse betrayed her.

After dinner, the three of them stepped out to the balcony. The city stretched beneath them, glittering and damp from a light drizzle. Horns blared faintly from below, the night thick with the scent of rain on asphalt.

David excused himself to take a call, leaving them in the cool night air.

For a moment, silence reigned. Then Jabari spoke.

“You always seem… perfect,” he said quietly, leaning on the railing. “Even now, when you’re just standing here. But I wonder…” His eyes caught hers, steady, unflinching. “…do you ever let yourself breathe?”

Her lips parted, but no sound came. She turned toward the lights of the city, her hands tightening on the railing. No one had ever asked her that.

Before she could reply, David returned, cheerful and oblivious, and the moment dissolved. But it lingered, etched into her skin.

Later that night, long after David had left for the hospital, Nala sat in her bedroom, staring at her phone. A message had appeared.

*Let’s meet. Just the two of us.* – Jabari.

Her pulse pounded. She set the phone down, then picked it up again. The words glowed on the screen, daring her.

Her hand trembled with the weight of one choice.

The message glowed on her screen all night. *Let’s meet. Just the two of us.*

Nala lay awake, staring at the ceiling, heart thudding with a mix of guilt and desire. She knew what the right thing was: delete the message, roll over, and call David in the morning to tell him about it. But her thumb hovered, betraying her.

By evening the next day, she found herself standing outside a rooftop bar in Westlands, the kind of place where the city spread beneath you in glittering chaos. She told herself she was only coming for clarity, to prove to herself there was nothing here. But the moment she saw him leaning against the railing, blazer unbuttoned, shirt collar loose, his skin catching the city lights, every rational thought deserted her.

“Glad you came,” Jabari said, voice smooth and low, like a secret.

“I shouldn’t be here,” she replied, though her feet carried her closer.

“Maybe not,” he said with a slow smile. “But you wanted to.”

Their conversation danced around the surface at first—his years in London, her cases at the firm—but beneath it, something darker hummed. The way his eyes held hers a second too long. The way he leaned in as though every word she spoke was worth keeping. She felt alive in a way she hadn’t in years, as though the city itself had poured fire into her veins.

When his fingers brushed hers on the table, a spark shot through her so sharp she almost pulled away. Almost. Instead, she let it linger.

“You feel it too,” he murmured, more statement than question.

Her chest rose and fell too fast. She swallowed, eyes darting away. “This is madness. David trusts us both.”

His smile faded, replaced by something softer, more dangerous. “I love him like a brother. I’d never set out to hurt him. But you…” His eyes darkened, voice dropping lower. “You undo me, Nala. I can’t stop thinking about you.”

The words seared through her. She should have run. Instead, she leaned in, breath trembling. “Don’t say that.”

“I have to,” he said, and the intensity in his gaze made her feel naked. “You’re not like anyone else. I’ve been with women before, plenty, but none of them—none—ever felt like this.”

The air between them throbbed with heat, her pulse matching it.

When she finally pulled back, heart racing, she knew she was already lost.

Later, in her bedroom, Miriam’s words echoed in her mind: *One day, life will throw you a curve, and I can’t wait to see what you do.*

Well, here it was. And she was no longer certain she wanted to dodge it.



**PART 2: ADDICTED**

The messages began innocently enough.

*How was your day?*  
*Can’t stop thinking about last night.*  
*You looked incredible in that dress.*

At first, Nala told herself she could stop whenever she wanted. That these late-night texts weren’t betrayal, not really — just words, just harmless connection. But soon her phone was buzzing at all hours, and she lived for the glow of Jabari’s name on her screen.

Each message was a spark, and she was addicted to the burn.

When they crossed paths again at a dinner with friends, it was unbearable. Sitting across from him, David at her side, their eyes found each other over and over, lingering too long. A brush of his knee under the table made her breath catch. When David excused himself to take a call, Jabari leaned close enough that his lips almost grazed her ear.

“You’re mine, Nala,” he whispered. “Even here.”

Her heart hammered so loudly she thought the whole table could hear. She should have pulled away. Instead, she shivered with something that felt dangerously like joy.

Nights blurred into a secret rhythm. Rooftop bars. Stolen hours in a quiet hotel room. Even moments on her own balcony when David was on call at the hospital, the city glittering below as Jabari’s hands traced fire along her skin. She had never felt so alive.

Jabari was a storm, a drug, a danger she couldn’t put down. Every kiss was lightning, every touch a blaze that burned away her guilt until only hunger remained.

And yet, the double life weighed heavy. By day, she played the fiancée—dinners with David’s family, wedding talk with her parents. By night, she unraveled in Jabari’s arms, tasting freedom she had never allowed herself before.

Miriam noticed first.

One afternoon, they sat again at their usual café. Nala tried to sip her tea casually, but Miriam’s eyes narrowed.

“You’re glowing,” she said, blunt and amused.

“Glowing?” Nala laughed too quickly. “I’m just… happy.”

“Happy, my foot.” Miriam leaned forward, voice dropping. “There’s something different about you. You’re lighter. Sparkier. And don’t tell me it’s David—because I’ve seen the way you look at him, and it’s not this.”

Nala froze, her spoon clinking too hard against the cup. She forced a smile, shaking her head. “You’re imagining things.”

But Miriam’s grin told her she wasn’t buying it. “Mm-hm. Keep your secrets, Mwende. But one day, you’ll spill. And I’ll be here, waiting with popcorn.”

Nala laughed it off, but her chest ached. Miriam was right—she was different. She was lit from within by something reckless and wild. Something dangerous.

She just wasn’t ready to admit it.

Their meetings grew bolder. A rooftop bar one night, a quiet hotel suite the next. Nala had told herself she could resist, that she was strong enough to play with fire without being consumed. But Jabari was not a man who allowed half measures. Every time she swore it would be the last, she found herself answering his texts, her body betraying her mind.

One evening, as Nairobi’s skyline glittered beyond the floor-to-ceiling hotel window, she lay tangled in the sheets, breath unsteady. Jabari sat beside her, bare chest glistening in the half-light, a glass of whisky in his hand. For once, his smile was absent.

“I’ve never done this before,” he said, staring into the amber liquid.

Nala laughed softly, pulling the sheet tighter around her. “What? Slept with a woman? I find that hard to believe.”

His eyes flicked to hers, serious. “I’ve slept with women. Too many. I’ve broken hearts, walked away, never looked back. But this—” He reached out, brushing her jaw with his thumb. “This isn’t the same. You’re not the kind of woman a man forgets.”

Her chest tightened. She wanted to believe him, and yet fear clawed at her. “And what about David?” she whispered.

His hand lingered on her skin, eyes dark with conflict. “He’s my brother. I love him. Hurting him is the last thing I want. But, Nala…” His voice dropped, raw. “I can’t let you go. You’re it for me.”

Her pulse thundered, torn between guilt and exhilaration. In his arms, she felt both doomed and alive.

The next afternoon, she met Miriam for coffee. Nala had tried to hide the changes—looser hair, brighter clothes, the glow that clung to her—but Miriam saw straight through.

“Okay,” Miriam said, sipping her latte slowly, eyes narrowing. “Who is he?”

Nala froze, spoon hovering over her tea. “What are you talking about?”

Miriam smirked, unimpressed. “Don’t play dumb. You’ve been smiling at nothing. You’re walking lighter, like you’ve got a secret. Spill.”

Nala forced a laugh, shaking her head. “You’re imagining things. I’ve just been… less stressed, maybe.”

Miriam leaned across the table, her earrings swinging. “Nala Mwende, I’ve known you for years. I know your ‘focused’ face, your ‘bored stiff with David’ face, and this—” she pointed her spoon like an arrow—“this is new. This is I’ve-seen-someone-undress-me-with-his-eyes-and-I-liked-it.”

Heat rushed to Nala’s cheeks. She stirred her tea furiously, avoiding Miriam’s piercing gaze. “You’re ridiculous.”

“Mm-hm,” Miriam hummed, leaning back with a wicked grin. “Keep lying, my dear. But remember—secrets have a way of slipping out.”

Nala smiled tightly, but her chest throbbed with guilt. Miriam didn’t know the half of it.

The club was loud, pulsing with Afrobeats and flashing neon. Miriam had dragged Nala out for “girls’ night,” insisting she needed to loosen up. But halfway through the evening, Nala caught sight of him. Jabari, leaning against the bar, blazer discarded, shirt sleeves rolled, looking like temptation itself.

Her heart lurched. She hadn’t expected him here—but then again, Nairobi was a small city for secrets.

Miriam spotted her distraction instantly. “Don’t tell me you’re ogling some stranger,” she teased, swaying to the music. But nala didn’t hear her, her gaze focussed on Jabari. Miriam leaned in. “ I’m going to ladies, be back just now.”  Mirriam headed towards the toilets.

The next moment, Jabari was beside Nala. His hand brushed her back, steadying her as the crowd surged. His mouth dipped close to her ear, the bass vibrating through them both. “Dance with me.”

It wasn’t a request.

Nala hesitated for a heartbeat—then let herself be pulled into him. His hands were strong, anchoring her waist, guiding her as the rhythm overtook them. Every move was heat, every shift of his body against hers a promise of something deeper. She forgot Miriam, forgot the crowd, forgot everything except the man whose presence set her veins alight.

By the time they slipped outside for air, her pulse was a drumbeat in her throat. The city sprawled around them, alive with noise and light, but the balcony felt like its own universe. Jabari pressed her gently against the railing, his gaze fierce.

“Let’s get out of here,” his voice was low, rough, “ I need you”.

Her breath came shallow, chest tight. “I need you too”.

Her throat ached. For years, she had lived the life mapped out for her: dutiful daughter, loyal partner, the girl who always chose the right thing. But here, in the city’s heat and chaos, with Jabari’s hands framing her face, she felt like herself—raw, flawed, alive.

She kissed him, fiercely, desperately. And in that kiss was everything she feared and everything she craved.

David’s night shifts had become relentless. Three, sometimes four in a row, leaving him stumbling home just as dawn painted the sky, his body heavy with exhaustion. He would collapse into bed still half in his scrubs, pressing a tired kiss to her forehead before sinking into dreamless sleep. At first, Nala had pitied him, resented how much of their time the hospital stole. Now, it gave her room—room for nights spent elsewhere, in someone else’s arms, while David remained none the wiser.

When he did have time for her, it was in fragments. A rushed dinner. A movie half-watched before his head dropped against her shoulder in sleep. Sometimes, he reached for her in bed, the way he always had—tender, steady, dependable. But now Nala pulled away, citing exhaustion, early mornings, deadlines at the firm.

“Not tonight,” she whispered once, guilt tightening her chest.

David sighed, kissing her temple with weary affection. “We’re both tired. When this rotation ends, things will go back to normal.”

Normal. The word cut her. Because nothing about her life felt normal anymore.

Sunday dinner at the Otieno house was proof of the life she was supposed to want. The table was rich with ugali, sukuma, goat stew, laughter rising with the steam. David’s mother fussed over her, calling her “my daughter already,” while his father asked about her latest cases at the firm. David sat beside her, hand warm and steady on her knee, pride written in his every glance.

“You two must set a date soon,” his mother urged, beaming. “Five years, one year engaged—it’s time!”

Nala forced a smile, her fingers brushing the engagement ring on her hand. It glittered under the warm light, heavy as a chain. She nodded politely, her throat dry.

Later, walking home with David, he slipped his arm around her shoulders. “You looked beautiful tonight,” he said softly. “I can’t wait to see you as my wife.”

She smiled, but her stomach twisted. Because all the while, her phone buzzed in her purse. One word lighting the screen.

*Come.* – Jabari.

 And when David kissed her goodnight and headed back to work, Nala slipped back out into the night.

Jabari’s apartment was alive with music and low light. He opened the door shirtless, his body sculpted like temptation itself, a glass of whisky in his hand.

“You’re late,” he teased, pulling her inside.

“I couldn’t just walk out,” she whispered, still breathless from the rush of deceit.

But the moment his arms wrapped around her, every ounce of guilt dissolved. He kissed her like a man starved, like every second without her had been unbearable. And she kissed him back, desperate, reckless, alive.

The city blurred beyond the windows, but inside his apartment, everything sharpened: the heat of his mouth, the strength of his hands, the low sound in his throat when she clung to him like a lifeline. Every touch reminded her why she couldn’t stay away. He was danger, he was freedom, he was the fire she had been starving for.

Later, curled against his chest, Nala let herself laugh, really laugh. He teased her about her strict schedules, mimicked her lawyerly tone, made her forget the weight of her double life. For a few stolen hours, there was only them—heat, laughter, fire.

“You’re mine,” Jabari murmured into her hair. “No matter what the world thinks.”

She closed her eyes, because in that moment, she wanted nothing else to be true.

Miriam had been dodged long enough. For two weeks Nala had ignored her calls, made excuses for coffee dates, sent half-hearted texts. But when they finally met again at their usual café, Miriam’s expression was cool, her arms folded tight across her chest.

“You left me,” she said flatly, skipping any pretence of small talk. “That night. Girls’ night. I turned around and you were gone. Hours, Nala. Hours. And when I finally spotted you—” her voice sharpened, “—you were slipping out with him. With Jabari.”

Nala’s stomach dropped. She hadn’t meant for Miriam to see. She hadn’t meant to abandon her. But in the haze of music, lights, and Jabari’s hand on hers, she had forgotten everything else.

“Miriam, I—”

“No.” Miriam’s voice cut like glass. “Don’t. I’ve defended you for years when people called you too careful, too predictable. And honestly? I was glad you finally seemed… alive. But him?” She shook her head, disbelief clouding her features. “Of all the men in Nairobi, you pick Jabari Mwinyi?”

Her chest tightened. “You don’t understand.”

“Oh, I understand perfectly.” Miriam’s eyes blazed. “He’s David’s best friend. His brother. You think this is love, Nala? This is betrayal on both sides. And when David finds out—and he will—it’ll destroy him.”

Nala’s throat ached. She wanted to explain, to defend herself, but no words came. She saw the judgment in Miriam’s eyes, the disappointment that cut deeper than anger.

“You always said you wanted to do the right thing,” Miriam said softly, almost mournful now. “But this? This is the one thing you can’t make right.”

That night, in Jabari’s apartment, the city glowing through the windows, she broke.

“He knows,” she whispered, pacing, her arms wrapped tightly around herself. “Miriam knows. She saw us. And she hates me for it.”

Jabari watched her, leaning back in his chair, shirt unbuttoned at the collar. For once, there was no smirk on his lips.

“She’ll get over it,” he said, his voice steady.

“She won’t. And when David finds out—” Her voice cracked. “Jabari, he’s your brother.”

“I know who he is,” Jabari snapped, then softened instantly, standing to close the space between them. He cupped her face, forcing her to meet his gaze. “I’ve spent my whole life running through women, never settling, never even wanting to. And then you walked in, and suddenly I can’t breathe without you. You think I don’t hate myself for what this means for David? You think I don’t lie awake every night knowing I’m breaking the only brotherhood I’ve ever had?”

Her breath shuddered against his chest. “Then why—”

“Because I can’t let you go,” he said fiercely. “I’ve tried. God knows I’ve tried. But you—” he kissed her forehead, then her cheek, lingering near her lips—“you’re it, Nala. The one. And if I burn for it, so be it.”

Her hands trembled as they gripped his shirt. She hated him for saying it, hated herself for believing it. But when his mouth finally found hers, all that hate melted into heat, and she knew she was lost.

Miriam had been dodged long enough. For two weeks Nala had ignored her calls, made excuses for coffee dates, sent half-hearted texts. But when they finally met again at their usual café, Miriam’s expression was cool, her arms folded tight across her chest.

Miriam’s eyes were sharp, unwavering.

“I saw you, Nala,” she said, folding her arms across her chest. “At the club. You disappeared with him. Don’t insult me by pretending it was nothing.”

Nala’s mouth went dry. “You don’t know what you saw.”

“I know enough,” Miriam shot back. “I know there’s a man. And I know he’s the reason you’ve been glowing these past weeks, walking around like someone lit a match under your skin. So tell me—who is he?”

Nala hesitated. She could have lied, chosen another name, softened the truth. But the words slipped out before she could stop them.

“Jabari Mwinyi.”

Miriam’s face dropped. “*David’s* Jabari?”

Nala nodded, pulse pounding.

“Jesus, Nala.” Miriam leaned back, shaking her head. “You’re sleeping with David’s best friend? Do you even hear yourself? This isn’t just reckless—it’s cruel.”

“Miriam, you don’t understand—”

“Oh, I understand perfectly.” Miriam’s voice trembled between disbelief and fury. “I’ve heard the stories. Everyone has. Jabari and the trail of broken hearts he left behind before he ran off to London. Women who swore he was serious, only for him to vanish the second he got bored. And now you?”

Nala’s chest tightened. “He’s not like that with me.”

Miriam’s eyes softened, just slightly. “I believe you *think* that. But what if you’re wrong? What if he burns you too? You’re risking everything—your career, your engagement, your family’s pride—for a man who could leave you shattered. And worst of all—you’re betraying David with *him*. His brother in everything but blood.”

Nala’s eyes stung. “It’s not that simple.”

“Yes, it is,” Miriam snapped. Then her tone shifted, sad but firm. “If you want Jabari, fine. But have the decency to break things off with David first. Don’t make a fool of him. Don’t be that woman.”

That night, Jabari held her close in his apartment, the city lights casting shadows across his face. He kissed her, slow but intense, before pulling back.

“You’re trembling,” he murmured.

“Miriam knows,” Nala confessed, her voice breaking. “She saw us. And she thinks I’m a monster.”

His jaw tightened. “She doesn’t matter.”

“She does. She’s right. I’m engaged. To your best friend. You realize how impossible this is?”

Jabari’s gaze burned into her. “Nothing about us is impossible. I’ve had flings, Nala. Too many. I’ve walked away without looking back. But this?” He grabbed her hand, pressing it against his chest. “This is different. You’re the first woman who’s made me want to stay. Don’t ask me to step aside so he can keep dreaming of a future that doesn’t exist anymore. I can’t live in the shadows, not with you.”

Nala’s breath caught. Torn between the life she’d built and the fire she couldn’t resist, she clung to him, saying nothing. Because she wasn’t ready. Not yet.

Until that night, Nala had drawn one line. She had never allowed Jabari into the apartment she shared with David. Never into *their* bed. No matter how reckless she’d been in bars, in cars, in Jabari’s place across town, she had clung to that boundary. It was her last scrap of loyalty, the one lie she told herself to soften the guilt: *at least not here*.

But when Jabari showed up at her door just past midnight, his eyes burning, his voice low and hungry, she couldn’t send him away. David was on another brutal night shift at the hospital—forty-eight hours straight. She told herself no one would ever know.

And so she let him in.

The sex was frantic, a blur of heat and sheets, her body betraying every vow she’d ever made. After, she lay against him, the scent of him on her skin, the guilt pushed down so deep she almost forgot it existed.

Almost.

The sound of the key in the front door turned her blood to ice.

Jabari tensed. “No—” he whispered, already half-rising.

But it was too late. The bedroom door opened, and David stood there in the dim light. He had come home early, his scrubs still creased, exhaustion shadowing his face. But the look in his eyes cut through every ounce of fatigue—rage, grief, disbelief all fused together.

For a moment, none of them moved.

Then David’s voice, hoarse and raw:  
“So this is why you’ve been so tired.”

Nala scrambled upright, clutching the sheet to her chest, words choking in her throat. “David—”

“Don’t.” His hands shook as he stepped into the room. His eyes flicked between them, between the man he had called his brother and the woman he had wanted for his wife. “Not one word.”

Jabari’s jaw flexed, but he said nothing. His silence was admission enough.

David’s breath came hard and fast, his face pale with the weight of betrayal. “Five years, Nala. And you throw it all away—here? In our bed?”

Her tears blurred the edges of the room. “I—”

“You don’t even recognize what you’ve done,” he said, his voice breaking. He turned to Jabari, fury trembling in his frame. “My brother. You too.”

The silence stretched, unbearable, until David spun away. The door slammed behind him, the sound ricocheting through the apartment.

Nala sat frozen, the sheet clutched tight, her pulse roaring in her ears. For the first time, she understood there was no line left to cling to. The fire she had lit had consumed everything.

I’m doing some research on remote work for my dissertation and I’m really interested in the *rituals* people use to create boundaries or structure in their day.

For example - do you have a small routine that helps you “arrive” at work even though you’re at home? Maybe it’s making a specific coffee, taking a walk before logging on, lighting a candle, or even changing clothes.

I’d love to hear what helps you transition in and out of work mode, and whether you feel these little rituals affect your focus, mood, or overall work-life balance.

Two months ago we got assigned to the same project, and had loads of work together, we held all-day-long meetings where there were only the two of us. One month ago he started acting strangely with me, I would even say provocatively, he brought me coffee to my desk, asked me about my private life (more than before), organised unnecessary 1v1 meetings with me and regularly left work at the same time and walked me to the bus station.

Last week he confessed to me that he has been in love with me for over two months. He mentioned that it started with a crush, and he thought that he could suppress his feelings, but turned out he couldn’t and that’s when he started acting provocatively (I suppose he wanted to find out if I had the same feelings for him).

The problem is, that he’s been married to his wife for one year, and I have a fiancée for a few months now. As he said he realises that this is therefore four people’s concern, but he told that he would divorce his wife for me as well.
I feel very disappointed, and confused, because I feel like I have also developed minor feelings for him during this two months, I can’t really deny it. I told him I was not up to starting a relationship with him, that I love my fiancée (which is true), and that it is normal developing these feelings for someone else from time to time, the question is how one reacts to these feelings.

We agreed to keep distance, and that nothing will happen between us, but I keep finding myself thinking about him. I am so confused, I can’t leave this workplace for other reasons, how could I keep distance when we see each other at work frequently? I don’t want to cheat on my fiancée, but it keeps getting harder for me, having some feelings developed for my colleague.",1,1762863257.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

For example you need to start cleaning from 20:30-21:00 the soda machine, the ice cream machine, the coffee makers and then put towels down, then the ""pistols"" for the sauce then clean the kitchen utensils and trays that are being used less and less since everything has to be clean by closing time.

Most experience I have with is McDrive (3-4 days), I have been restocking all the fryers, fridges, getting items from the freezer room, preparing tomatoes, refilling the boxes used by kitchen, cleaning everything they throw at me and I also have to take orders from cars, isn't this too much? On the small sheet there need to be 23 people working and we are left with 4-5 people to handle every single thing from 21:30 to 01:00 and everything turns messy and rushed as I've said.
I will probably quit by the end of the month, the restaurant is huge 500-600m2 and it's simply too much work and multitasking you have to go through on top of the guiltness I feel when probably 10 people daily get sick or get stomach issues by the food I am giving them by hand.

Lobby people (cleaning - closing) clean the toilets (just the tissues, empty the small cans and clean the mirrors), clean the parking area (bins outside and big things on the parking area), broom the entire restaurant - just the big noticeable things (customer area inside) and clean the tables (60 ish), then clean as I said the coffee makers and the others machines and finally broom and mop the McCafè and the counters. They also of course clean the room for staff (where the cleaning stuff is and also where the tray carts are being emptied)

Kitchen - clean the table and their wall, the grill, assemble the things (that are given by the drive guy that cleans it), mop and broom their lane

Drive - clean the fryers, fry storing place, clean/refill the fridges, clean every singular utensil and box that they are thrown at and also parts of the grill, the sauce pistols, etc.

So I figured I would look at the raw materials map and see if this was represented in the game, along with any other significant historical resources.

I found that these these regions are represented, the resource icon on the raw materials map mode has a little green + at the bottom right of the icon if the location has a modifier. Here is my list of locations that I found.

But something is missing. That one element that pulls the entire room together, adds warmth, and defines the space: the rug.

But then comes the question that stops even the most confident decorator in their tracks: *What size washable rug do I actually need for my living room?*

Go too small, and your furniture looks like it's floating awkwardly on an island. Go too large, and the room feels cramped and overwhelmed. It's a high-stakes decision.

But don't worry. We're here to take the guesswork out of it. This guide will give you clear, actionable rules and simple sizing tricks to help you find the perfectly sized **washable rug** for your living room.

## Why Getting the Rug Size Right is a Game-Changer

Before we dive into measurements, let's talk about *why* this matters so much. A correctly sized rug:

*   **Anchors the Space:** It visually ties your furniture together, creating a cohesive ""zone"" for conversation and relaxation.
*   **Adds Comfort & Warmth:** It provides a soft surface underfoot, both literally and visually.
*   **Defines Your Layout:** In open-concept homes, a rug is the number one tool for carving out a distinct living area.
*   **Makes the Room Look Bigger:** Counterintuitively, a larger rug that connects furniture can make a small room feel more spacious and intentional.

The biggest mistake people make? Choosing a rug that's too small. Remember this: a rug should connect your furniture, not sit underneath it like a tiny doormat.

## The 3 Golden Rules for Living Room Rug Sizing

Forget complicated formulas. These three simple rules will cover 99% of living room layouts.

### ### 1. The ""Front Legs On"" Rule (The Go-To Standard)

This is the most popular and versatile rule for a reason. It works in almost any space.

*   **The Rule:** At minimum, the front legs of all your main seating pieces (sofa, armchairs) should be on the rug.
*   **Why it Works:** It creates a unified look without requiring a massive rug. It visually links the furniture while still showing off some of your flooring.
*   **Perfect For:** Small to medium-sized living rooms, apartments, and layouts where the furniture is pushed against a wall.

![Image of a living room where the front legs of the sofa and chairs are on the rug](https://i.imgur.com/example1.jpg)

### ### 2. The ""All Furniture On"" Rule (The Luxurious Look)

If you have a larger room and want to create a truly defined, high-end feel, this is your rule.

*   **The Rule:** All legs of every piece of furniture in the main seating area are fully on the rug.
*   **Why it Works:** It makes the entire seating arrangement feel like one grand, intentional piece. It's the epitome of a ""put-together"" space.
*   **Perfect For:** Large living rooms, open-concept spaces, and furniture arrangements that ""float"" in the middle of the room.

### ### 3. The ""Coffee Table Anchor"" Rule

This rule isn't a standalone, but a crucial checkpoint for the first two.

*   **The Rule:** Your coffee table should sit comfortably centered on the rug. When you're seated, you should be able to place a drink on the table without having the ""leg on, leg off"" dilemma.
*   **The Guideline:** Aim for at least 12-18 inches of rug space extending beyond the coffee table on all sides.

## Pro Tips to Nail It on the First Try

Ready to shop? Do these two things *before* you click ""add to cart.""

### **Pro Tip #1: The Painter's Tape Trick**

This is the single best way to avoid buyer's remorse.

1.  Get a roll of blue painter's tape.
2.  Mark out the dimensions of the rug you're considering on your floor.
3.  Live with it for a day. Walk around it. See how your furniture fits.
4.  Does it feel right? Great! Does it feel too small or too big? Adjust the tape and try a different size. This simple trick gives you a real-world visualization without any risk.

### **Pro Tip #2: Don't Forget the Rug Pad!**

A rug pad is not optional. It's essential.
*   **Safety:** It prevents slipping and bunching.
*   **Comfort:** It adds a lovely layer of cushioning.
*   **Durability:** It protects your rug and your floors from wear and tear.
*   **Washable Rug Specifics:** Many **washable rugs** have non-slip backings, but a pad still adds that extra layer of plushness and protection. *[Check out our guide to choosing the right rug pad for your floors!]*

## Why a Washable Rug is the Smart Choice

We've focused on the **washable rug** for a reason. It’s the modern solution to a high-traffic area. You get the style and comfort of a traditional rug with incredible peace of mind.

*   **Spills? No problem.** From muddy paws to red wine, most messes can be tackled by just tossing the rug in the wash.
*   **Allergies? Breathe easy.** Regular washing removes dust, dander, and allergens that get trapped in rug fibers.
*   **Pet Owners? It's a must-have.** Life happens. A washable rug lets you enjoy your pets without stressing over your decor.

The best part? These practical, modern rugs come in all the standard sizes we've discussed—from 5'x7's for cozy apartments to sprawling 9'x12's for spacious living rooms. You never have to sacrifice style for practicality.

1ou7q7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultingph/comments/1ou7q7w/i_regret_not_worrying_about_money_when_i_was_a/,"I regret not worrying about money when i was a bit younger. Now even a ""20 Peso"" Coin matters alot.","Hi! 18M and currently studying BS Computer Engineering here at a local college. 

You know the **""uyyy tara mcdo, mamaya""** or **""may nakita akong bagong kapehan later, try natin bilis""**. Some of you might relate to this and oo, it was a time full of gastos and unnecessary large spending. Mcdo? 500 pesos for a full single meal. **500?!?!**.. 200 for a single coffee. **YES 200!** Ah, it was a time where i didnt really knew what the value of money was, given that i am given my ""baon"" and didn't really think much of my interests or... the.... future.

  
Now, I turned 18. AND I WAS LIKE, what is this course? why did i took engineering? omg sobrang gastos atekooo. Sabay pa yung pag-ggym ko which costs 600 monthly. Supplements amounting to atleast 1,200 monthly. Nagkandarapa na ako paano makakaipon BWHAHAHAHA. It's like the ""Financial Awakening"" state of me na na-trigger by just turning 18.. And even thought i hate to say it. My own father steals my own money. **LEGIT**. Sometimes makikita ko wallet ko, short ng 1k. Pag tinanong ko father ko (Siya lang naman napasok ng room ko) is natanggi. Like, what the hell. This is where I discovered how to use cards, a debit card. Ako nagasikaso ng debit card ko, no help from anyone whatsoever. I opened my savings account for my wants and needs (Esp for a motorcycle which is what im gonna discuss on the next wall of text).



Then, I got an interest in motorcycles. Nahihirapan kasi ako minsan mag commute, 1 hour to our local bayan because of traffic and 30 minutes to school (which should've been just 5 minutes if not for the traffic) which is why a motorcycle is a big thing for me. So, since bibili na ako ng first motorcycle, why not go for a decent one. I found a relatively cheap touring bike worth 130,000php with 300cc and a sporty looking bike for 90,000php. Ang akin is gusto ko itake yung 130,000 php para sulit na yung pera ko. Pero the problem is PERAAAAAAAAAA. I'm not saying na hindi supportive parents ko sa'kin, but when it comes to money, talagang mahirap. My guardian na nagpapaaral sakin is above minimum wage earner, and he's my uncle. My tatay doesnt sustent me, (LOL). So, when i discussed the motorcycle thing to my uncle. ""Hindi mo kailangan nan."" ""Wala akong ibibigay sayo kahit piso."" Given naman kasi i'm just his nephew na pinapaaral pero damn, it does hurt. When your own father doesn't even care about you yet has the balls to steal money from you? What a disgrace.

  
During this time I really did what I could to save a few extra bucks. Instead na mag-ttricycle ako, I commuted sa Jeep para makasave. Tatanggihan ko mga friends ko sa mga yaya nila sakin just because I can just eat at home in leasure without my money being spent. Coffee? I can just brew my own coffee. Craving for spaghetti? Whip out the instant spaghetti from the pantry and be done with it. **I even got to a stage where I was desparate.** I tried the get paid for doing survey thing. I got 300 php after 2 weeks and decided to drop it because it was so slow and time consuming. I opened a LinkedIn profile in hopes of finding a good part time job; 3 months, **nothing**. Looked at local hiring groups, same thing; **nothing.** And now, at the moment I am writing this post, I am still actively looking for a side gig. 

  
**CONCLUSION**

To the younger audiences like me, please take your time and consider your situation. If mayaman ka naman, maybe your spending can be justified because hey? daddy's pera. But to people who are just like me where money is crucial, maybe we can cut back that mcdo and just do it at a later time. It's fine to ""enjoy"" ur younger days, but again, to people like me whose only living off baons and even uncertain for the future, maybe let's take a moment, and just realized, what are we really doing this for?

Last night I took 120mg of dihydrocodeine (recreationally) at around 7pm. I've taken it before, but never at this dose and I haven't taken any in about two years so I have basically no tolerance. I didn't have any side effects other than some nausea but I was fine last night. 

About 20 minutes ago, I suddenly felt like I needed to throw up. I got to the bathroom and immediately vomited (so fast that I couldn't aim in the toilet properly) and I noticed it looked a bit strange. I'm concerned that it has the ""coffee ground"" look that is usually a concern but I honestly can't tell. I vomited twice, I didn't take a picture of the first time but it looked orange/brown, however I ate chocolate cake yesterday and drank diet coke this morning so I assume that's why. 

Anyways, the image is here: https://flic.kr/p/2rEGWMF 

Please let me know if this looks normal or if I'm overreacting...

# **Puerto Rican Frankenstein**  

---

## **Act I – The Summer Assignment**

They say every family’s got a story that shouldn’t be told — something old, strange, and best left to rest. In Carlos’s family, that story was Doctor Frankenstein.

Not *the* Frankenstein — but *a* Frankenstein, a distant uncle on his mother’s side who, according to abuela, had “too much money, too much lightning, and not enough Jesus.”

When the letter came inviting Carlos to spend the summer at the estate on the island, his mother clapped her hands and said, *“¡Ay, mira! Que rico!”*  
His father muttered something about “white people trouble” and went back to his crossword.

Me? I was just happy to tag along. Carlos needed a wingman — or, as it turned out, a witness.

---  

The estate sat on a cliff outside Rincón, a mismatched labyrinth of towers, patched shutters, and overgrown orchids. It looked like someone had built it during a hurricane and never stopped.

We arrived at sunset, the air heavy with salt and mystery. Out front stood a man the size of a refrigerator, wearing khaki shorts, flip-flops, and a gardening hat three sizes too small.

He waved.  
“Hola, muchachos! You must be the science boys.”

That was **Frankie**.

At first, I thought he was just a groundskeeper — a polite, sunburned handyman with skin like patchwork leather and an accent that defied geography. But then he wiped his hands on a towel embroidered with *DR. F*, and Carlos froze.

“Wait,” he said. “You’re the—?”  
Frankie grinned, his teeth too perfect. “Depends who’s asking, bro.”

---

That’s when **Igorito** appeared.  
No one ever saw him approach — he just sort of *materialized*, like a Wi-Fi connection. Barely five feet tall, wide grin, carrying a toolbox held together with duct tape and optimism.

“This is the help,” Frankie said, nodding.  
“The *assistant,* jefe,” Igorito corrected. “Technician, consultant, inventor in residence—”  
“—janitor,” Frankie finished.  
Igorito glared but bowed anyway. “As needed, boss man of bolts.”

That was our welcome committee: an undead landlord and his self-proclaimed apprentice.

---

At dinner, Frankie served mofongo and poured rum into everyone’s water glass “for sterilization.”  
He told us stories about his “research days” — how the doctor had believed death was just a bad habit, and electricity was motivation to quit.

Carlos, of course, was transfixed.  
“This is incredible,” he whispered to me. “If the notes still exist, I might be able to reconstruct the experiment!”

Frankie chewed his plantains thoughtfully.  
“I mean, you *could,*” he said, “but then you might have to live with it.”

I laughed.  
Carlos didn’t.

---

## **Act II – The Laboratory Below**

The next morning, Carlos was up before dawn, pacing, notebook in hand. He was muttering about “molecular vitality retention.” I was muttering about coffee.

Igorito was already tinkering with a blender he swore could “convert mangos to clean energy.” It exploded before breakfast.

“Prototype,” he said, wiping soot from his face.

When we asked about the basement, Frankie sighed like someone who’d watched too many horror movies and never learned.  
“Fine. But if you see a hand crawling around, it’s just my old roommate.”

Downstairs was every science cliché come to life: jars of organs, rusted coils, a Tesla rig that hummed when you swore too loudly. And in the corner, a chalkboard covered in equations that looked suspiciously like salsa dance steps.

Carlos was hooked. “He *was* a genius,” he whispered.  
Igorito squinted. “Or a madman.”

---

That night, lightning rolled over the ocean. Carlos couldn’t sleep. I caught him down in the lab, reading from a journal bound in cracked leather.  
“Listen to this,” he said. “‘To defy decay is to honor creation.’ He understood!”

I said, “He's also sacrilegious. He fried frogs for sport, bro. Perspective.”

He didn’t listen.

---

## **Act III – The Revelation**

By mid-summer, everyone on the island knew the doctor was back — at least, that’s what they thought. Frankie’s “medical consultations” had become local legend. People came for flu shots and left with unsolicited advice about mortality.

It would’ve gone on like that forever if Igorito hadn’t livestreamed one of their sessions.  
The thumbnail? Frankie adjusting his neck bolts under a fluorescent bulb.  
Caption: *“Doctor Gives Glow in the Dark???”*

The video went viral before we could delete it.

Suddenly, the villagers were outside the estate with torches, phones, and picket signs that said things like *“NO MONSTERS IN OUR HOA.”*

Frankie looked heartbroken.  
“Bro… they loved me when I fixed the gazebo.”

---

Carlos tried to calm them. “He’s not dangerous!” he yelled. “He’s reformed! He volunteers!”

But the crowd wanted proof — or a scapegoat.

And that’s when Kimber's dog died.

It wasn’t Frankie’s fault. The poor mutt got into a loose wire, sparked like a Christmas tree. Carlos panicked, dragged it into the lab, and shouted, *“I can fix this!”*

Frankie begged him to stop. “That’s how it starts, hermano. You don’t bring back what’s gone — you just change what’s left.”

Lightning struck.

The dog sneezed.

---

## **Act IV – The Resurrection**

There’s no describing that sound — halfway between a bark and a thunderclap.  
It was alive, wagging, glowing faintly blue.

Carlos cried. Igorito screamed. Frankie just stared, equal parts wonder and despair.  
“You did it,” he whispered. “You repeated the sin.”

Before we could celebrate, the crowd burst in. Cameras everywhere. Someone yelled, *“He’s raising an army!”*

Frankie stepped forward. “No army, bro. Just family.”

He walked into the storm to protect us. The lightning silhouetted him against the sea, bolts crackling like applause. For a moment, he looked peaceful — finally home in the chaos that birthed him.

Then he was gone.

---

## **Act V – The Refrain**

It’s been a year since that summer.

Carlos finished med school but never talks about surgery anymore. He volunteers at the animal shelter. The glowing dog — *Lumi* — sleeps under his desk.

Igorito runs a YouTube channel called *“Resurrect Responsibly.”* It’s 90% disaster footage.

And Frankie?

Every now and then, when a storm rolls through, the lights in Rincón flicker, and someone swears they see a giant shadow fixing gutters in the rain.

Maybe he’s gone. Maybe he’s just doing maintenance.

---

When people ask what really happened, I tell them the truth — or my version of it.  
That sometimes, the dead don’t come back to haunt us.  
They come back to help us fix the wiring.

I run a smallish chain of coffee shops. My bank told me today that they will no longer be giving out pennies to their business accounts due to the fact that they are not being made anymore.

I know McD (at least in my area) is already saying the same thing, that they are rounding their change off of the nickel now. Has anyone else run into this yet and if so, what is your plan for this? 

In theory, I'm okay with my cashiers just rounding the totals, but to be honest they freak out when someone gives them extra money just to round out their change. 

We've floated the idea of changing our pricing to be tax inclusive, but that means redoing all the pricing and I'd rather not have to do this if it's not necessary. Any suggestions would definitely be helpful!",3,1762862613.0,smallbusiness,4,1.0,False

My ex (29F) and I (29M) broke up around the end of August. It was a mutual, respectful breakup I had to go back to the US to finish my last year of uni, and we realized our long-term goals and where we want to live in the future didn’t really line up.

We dated for about 3 months. We went from saying i love you and i miss you and LITERALLY the next day she says she hoped we can be more platonic and wanted to be on friendly terms, but her texts went from paragraphs to short replies, and eventually we just stopped talking. We’ve been in no contact since September 15th.

And the part thats killing me is that after the first month when we started dating, we would spend every friday-monday(sometimes tuesday) together. She introduced me to her friends watched so many movies and spent so much time together going places or just spending the night at hers. Thats why im having a hard time accepting that is she really gone, does she really want nothing to do with me now. Was her saying our relationship was ""sweet and temporary"" because i had to go finish my final year in uni. And her saying""I dont want to burn a bridge if there was no reason to""  just to give me hope but in reality she would never walk on that bridge to meet me. Did she really love me or was I just there to alleviate her loneliness and she went on to the next one.

I was thinking about reaching out in December when I’ll be back in Canada for a few weeks, maybe to ask if she wants to grab coffee or something. There’s no bad blood between us, but part of me worries that by then she’s moved on cause on insta she seems happy, out with friends, living her life, seems like she already forgot about me and her follower/following has increased.

Im at a total loss. Cause her silence is telling me she wants nothing to do with me.

I’m a father, and the movie immediately put me back in the frustrating headspace of 2AM walking around my child’s room for ages, holding my infant in my arms as he cried, hoping he’ll fall back asleep. And then, it happened. 

My discomfort spiked like a motherfucker and I became incredibly anxious. I explained what I was feeling and asked her to spoil it a little and  all she said was, “it gets worse.” We made it probably 5 minutes after the incident, and then put on Heathers. After I was home, I read some reviews and I’m very glad I didn’t continue. That one probably would have wrecked me for a while. ",5,1762862178.0,horror,1,0.67,False

1ou7e23,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ou7e23/confused/,Confused,"One of my coworkers/friends hooked me up with one of his friends. I thought he was attractive, and he told me he is single, got us to exchange information. This was back in September. 

For the first couple weeks that we were messaging he was always very quick to respond and we pretty much talked all day everyday. We scheduled a coffee date. When I went out for my birthday my coworker brought this guy as a plus 1. 

After my birthday, his messages decreased significantly. He would now only message/respond 1-3 times per day. And he ended up cancelling our coffee date like an hour before we were supposed to go (saying he was tired). I figured maybe he didn't find me attractive (even though he had seen me in person before this and was flirting) or maybe I was too shy/awkward on my birthday and he decided he wasn't interested anymore. I brought it up to our mutual friend and he assured me that wasn't the case and the cancellation was probably his fault because they were running around all day playing sports. 

For the next MONTH. The messages continued like that. 1-3 times per day and he made no effort to reschedule a date. After 3-4 weeks of that, I started to become less interested myself. Sometimes he would snap me and I wouldn't respond at all (if he just sent a random photo and made no effort to make conversation then I wouldn't either), but even if I left him on read, he would message me again eventually. Which confused me more because like.. if he's not interested then I just gave him an out to ghost me and he isn't taking it? 

Then OUT OF ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE. He sent me a snap. I didn't open it. Close to 24 hours pass without me opening it (this had been normal behavior for me for the last like 2 weeks). He sends like 3-4 more snaps back to back, that I also didn't open because I was busy when I got them. So then he messages me on a different platform asking if I'm okay. I finally open the snaps and I tell him I'm fine, I'm just busy. He asked if I was mad at him, I said no??? And then he says he wanted to go out with me yesterday (when he sent the first snap that I let sit for 24 hours lol) and he's trying to reschedule that date from close to 2 months ago, he's being flirty (which he hadn't really done since we first started talking), and in the last day I've gotten more messages/replies from him than I have in the last week combined. My first instinct is that he was more interested in someone else, and now I'm the backup plan or something.

I asked our mutual friend about it and he said ""he's honestly just an idiot. He likes you"" and said his last relationship (which was like a year ago) didn't go super well, and his relationship before that he was engaged and it also didn't go well. One of my guy friends said he probably has commitment issues. I trust the mutual friend a lot - I genuinely think he would tell me if this guy had been talking multiple girls (if he knew). I'm just trying to make sense of the sudden shift lol I'm very confused. I told the guy that he kinda caught me off guard with the flirting because I didn't think he was interested anymore and he told me that he's just been busy and tired and he will always be down to flirt with me. But like.... He wasn't too busy and tired to chat/flirt the first 2 weeks we were talking?? Makes no sense, dude. Idk if I'm still interested in going out, particularly if I'm just a backup. I find him super attractive and he is pretty much everything I like personality wise (from what I've seen) but I don't fw being kind of ignored for over a month.

Basically it all started with when I took adm..I met her in a random clg gc. We talked a lot months not like person thing but yea did. 

Clg opened and I somehow was feeling that even without seeing her..I was attracted towards her..the vibe that matched between us.

Fast forward to present.

I proposed her..she didn't over react neither I do. She said no. Reason was she don't know me. I asked her out a bit that tell me real reason cuz this is not the one. Why I asked cuz I wanted to know (no hard feelings btw).  She still said she don't know me and she can't move on over her ex and all. Yea like i can see. 

But the thing is I'm not feeling diff..like usually for a normal guy he would have cursed the girl saying bad for rejection..but I was like

Dym it must be me cuz she's too good.

And yea I mean it she's too damn good. It's not like she give me mixed signal or playing with me. I didn't look for them. But she's just too good. 

I was still hopefull saying her that
""Filmo me aisa hota h.. stranger do fall in love""
And she be like..""ni hota😭..you still friendzoned..try on someone else kyuki ik u can pull better""

Ab I really don't know weather she's really like this or it's just her mind saying cuz she can't move on....

You know she told me one more thing
She said ""I though you are not serious for relationship"" and I was like bruh..I mean it's just I don't act for attention of yours..that doesn't mean I'm not serious...

Idk man kuch smj ni aara h.

I'm genuinely in love with her..merko sirf mere me glti lgri h and it is true..cuz she's too nice and good. I mean m ky hi bolu uske baare me..she's..she's just too good. 

Aaj Mera clg me mid sem tha..and usse ek din mene yeh sab hua. I was zoned out for like 40min and uske baad paper suru kia. she said a lot..it wasn't like she's tryna get rid over me..

She said ""uk..try on someone else tbh..ik u can get a better than me""
I was like I I can't think of anyone...and I'm this loyal in my mind that I don't even wanna..
She kept saying sorry to me..thing I'm hurt.

I also know I was getting to itchy and like begging which is kinda bad as well..

Idk man what should I do next. 

It's just I can't act being friends with her..I can't..I'm not saying I want a big commitment or relationship right now..take time maybe have coffee and all and let it go with flow but I messed up everything.

The worst mistake of mine is I never talk to her much face to face even though our group had lunch together daily.

As a dost puchra hu..cuz I have never been in relationship..aane se phele hi first love ka trauma h ( vo or bhayankar story h jiska end ord bhi bhayankar tha)..

He asked, all considerate-like, what I wanted.


I didn't even pause.


""The car. The house. The savings.""


""Oh, and half the company.""


Garrett froze. Didn't see that coming.


""What about the kids? You'd DIE for Finn and Mason—and now you're just leaving them?""


I looked down at my wrists. At the countless scars I'd earned in this marriage.


Then shook my head slowly.


Not anymore.


From now on, besides money, anything and everything tied to Garrett Hayes?


I was DONE.


---


Seeing how cold I was, Garrett looked like he wanted to say something.


But finally just shut up and signed the papers.


Right before we went our separate ways, he gave me this polite little speech.


""Shares? No. But you'll always be their mom.""


""Run into trouble? You can call me.""


I nodded.


Then the second I turned around, tossed his business card straight in the trash.


This lifetime? Even if I'm dying, I never wanna see Garrett Hayes again.


When I got back to our place in Greenwich, I told Margaret to pack up all of Garrett's stuff and throw it out.


She didn't think much of it. Just laughed.


""You two fighting again?""


""Honestly, just let it go.""


""He does care about you. Why throw away being Mrs. Hayes over some argument?""


All these years, everything I went through, Margaret saw it all.


She knew how crazy in love I was with Garrett.


Saw me lose it more times than I could count because he kept cheating.


Just like Garrett, she thought I'd never actually leave.


But this time? I didn't cry. Didn't complain.


Just took down our wedding photo and said, totally flat:


""My mom died.""


Margaret's smile vanished.


She just stood there, stammering out an apology.


I smiled a little. Said nothing.


Just hurled the frame and smashed it to pieces.


Margaret jumped.


Then bent down to help me clean up, carefully bandaging the cuts on my hand.


She muttered under her breath:


""Good. You should leave.""


""You graduated from Princeton. You don't need him.""


""Sweetheart, you don't have to take this anymore.""


I nodded. Kept my head down.


Wasn't planning on crying.


But the second I looked away, tears just came.


There was regret. Pain.


And somewhere in there—this twisted relief.


Ten years tangled up with him.


This whole prince-and-Cinderella thing?


Finally over.


Not a happy ending. But honestly? Saw it coming.


Chapter 2


When I was eighteen, I got into Princeton with the highest SAT score in my county—some nowhere town in Ohio.


That same year, I met Garrett Hayes. He'd just graduated and came back to throw money at his alma mater.


Every story starts out romantic, right?


Ours was no different.


Garrett fell for me at first sight.


The second his speech ended, he started chasing me like crazy—


He'd wait outside my classes with coffee and roses.


Venmo my roommates to track me down.


Remembered everything about me.


Confessed his love in a field full of wildflowers.


Back then, everyone said we'd never last.


They were convinced a small-town girl like me could never be good enough for Garrett Hayes.


But Garrett didn't care. Only wanted me.


He pushed through all the pressure and proposed.


Shielded me from all the hate.


Under his protection, my life—which had been rough and broke—suddenly switched to easy mode.


Flowers. Jewelry. Grad school. Study abroad in Paris.


Every opportunity just poured in.


I didn't even have to ask.


A teenage girl, sheltered and dreamy?


Under Garrett's relentless pursuit, I fell. Hard.


Gave up my future. Walked into marriage.


Dating. Wedding. Pregnancy. Kids.


Everything just... happened.


Back then, I thought life was a breeze.


Everything I wanted was right there.


I was drowning in love, thinking I'd won the lottery.


But here's the thing about fairy tales—they don't tell you the part where the prince turns into a monster.


Did I see the red flags? Oh, they were everywhere. I just chose to ignore them.


Because fate? It doesn't give gifts for free. There's always a price.


The day Finn was born, Garrett's mom—who I'd never even met—walked into my hospital room in Manhattan and took my baby.


She had this polite smile, but her voice was cold as hell.


""Finn's the future heir. He's too important.""


""With your background? You're not fit to raise him.""


Ten months of pregnancy. A brutal delivery that almost killed me.


And I didn't even get to hold my own baby.


Just to SEE him? I had to get permission first.


I begged Garrett not to be so cruel. Not to separate me from my child.


But he just looked at me weird.


""My mom's right though. You ARE from some nowhere town.""


""She already told me—I can mess around however I want, but when it comes to the kids? She's in charge.""


I was about to pass out from crying.


But Garrett didn't care. Just pulled me close and tried to kiss me.


Said, like it was nothing:


""Come on, don't be upset.""


""You want another kid? We'll make another one.""


I tried to push him away.


But when he saw all the stretch marks on my body, he stopped on his own.


There was this flicker in his eyes. Hesitation. Disgust.


After a long pause, all he said was:


""It's been a long day. Get some rest.""


Garrett's coldness hit me like a slap, snapping me out of the dream I'd been living.


I remembered his mom looking down on me. Remembered people laughing at me.


And suddenly I realized—


This so-called epic love story?


Just some rich guy's selfish game.


Fate gave me a gift once.


Now it was time to pay up.


And this baby? Just the beginning.


During recovery after Finn was born, I got severe postpartum depression.


Called Garrett. No answer.


Texted him. Nothing.


I was worried something happened.


Then the next morning, I found out he'd cheated.


Pictures of him screwing some nobody actress blew up the internet overnight.


People started betting on when I—the girl who married up—would get kicked out.


The online gossip shattered whatever fantasy I had left.


I couldn't take it.


My depression got worse.


Garrett and I had the worst fight ever.


I was spiraling. Grabbed a knife and started cutting myself.


Threatened to jump off the balcony right in front of him.


At the last second, Garrett grabbed me, shaking, and said he was sorry.


Did what every cheating husband does—cried and said he messed up.


Said it was all a misunderstanding.


Said he loved me. Begged for another chance.


That night, Garrett knelt in front of me, tears streaming down his face.


""Vivian, please. Forgive me just this once.""


Chapter 3


So I made the second worst decision of my life.


I forgave him.


Why? Because of the kids.


Because I still had feelings I couldn't let go of.


And because my mom suddenly got hit by a car, and I lost the last bit of family I had.


So Garrett and I got back together.


Pretty soon, I was pregnant again—with Mason.


Just like with Finn, the second Mason was born, they took him away.


The excuse? Garrett needed to focus on work. Couldn't deal with a crying baby.


Just to see my two kids, I had to wake up before dawn and go to his parents' place in the Hamptons.


Sit there while his mom tore me apart—told me I wasn't good enough, didn't belong, would never be one of them.


I had to smile through it. Agree with everything. Thank her for ""letting"" me see my own children.


All so she'd give me an hour with Finn and Mason before sending me away.


But everything I sacrificed?


All I got was Garrett's shameless betrayal.


And my two kids' disgust.


Finn refused to call me Mom.


Every time he saw me, he'd wrinkle his nose and say:


""That trashy woman's here again. I don't wanna see her.""


Mason couldn't talk yet.


He'd just cry and reach for his grandma.


And my mom? Her condition kept getting worse.


The kids' coldness. The crushing weight of my life.


I was exhausted. Hopeless.


Right when I needed support the most, Garrett was off playing house with another woman.


That day was our wedding anniversary.


Finn turned down my invite.


Garrett hung up on me.


But his side piece? She happily sent me a video of the two of them in bed.


Listening to them, I completely lost it.


Grabbed a knife and started slashing my arms again.


By the time Margaret burst into the bathroom, I'd already lost most of my blood.


She panicked and called Garrett.


But this time, he didn't come home till morning.


He crouched down in front of me, smirking at my mangled arms.


""Thought you were gonna off yourself?""


""Been all night. Why are you still crawling around here like a beaten dog?""


That one sentence made me snap.


Without thinking, I jumped off the balcony.


Didn't die.


Just broke my leg.


Garrett's mom got rid of all the reporters and dragged me to my mom's hospital room.


She looked down at me, cold as hell.


""ICU? Twenty grand a day.""


""You pull this shit again, your mom's dead. Simple as that.""


That was the first time I realized even death is a luxury.


I couldn't let go of the past. Couldn't cut ties with my own blood.


So I stayed trapped in this marriage where I didn't exist, shrinking smaller and smaller.


Watching my kids pull away.


Watching Garrett flirt with woman after woman.


Watching them use my mom to control my life…


A marriage into old money is both a dream and a prison.


Cinderella got her upgrade and became Mrs. Hayes.


But the prince? He just kept playing his games, rescuing one pretty, broke girl after another.


Until one day, Garrett went too far.


He fell for some thirty-something socialite who'd been married three times—and got her pregnant.


His mom lost her shit.


She slapped me twice, screaming that I couldn't even keep my own husband.


""Can't even keep your man? Pathetic.""


""Clean this up. Today.""


""Or your mom's done, and you'll never see those kids again.""


After my marriage fell apart, family was all I had left.


I couldn't lose my mom.


Couldn't lose that last bit of hope.


So I forced myself to meet Sienna Caldwell.


She wasn't like Garrett's other flings—arrogant, stuck-up.


Instead, she was polite. Humble.


Kept calling me ""Mrs. Hayes,"" looking at me like she was trying to win me over.


""Mrs. Hayes, I'm sorry. I really am.""


""I didn't mean for this to happen. I just... I fell for him.""


""If you want me gone, I'm gone. The baby too. Whatever you need.""


Sienna kept her word.


Took the money and vanished.


That same night, Garrett—who hadn't been home in forever—pushed open my bedroom door.


Didn't say a word. Just shoved me onto the bed and went straight in.


For an entire month, he didn't let me out of that bed.


Until I got pregnant with baby number three.


As a reward for cleaning up Garrett's mess—and to keep him from straying—his mom actually agreed to let me keep this baby and raise it myself.


And my mom's health started improving under the Hayes family's private doctors.


I was over the moon.


Thought maybe, finally, things were getting better.


But when I was eight months pregnant, Garrett pushed me down the stairs.

## Why Choose a Personalised Stocking? The Magic Explained

Before we dive into the ""what,"" let's talk about the ""why."" A personalised stocking offers more than just a place to stash candy canes and mini-gifts.

*   **Creates a Lasting Tradition:** A quality personalised stocking can last for years, even decades. Watching a child grow from a tiny toddler to a teenager with the same stocking creates a powerful sense of continuity and memory.
*   **Makes Everyone Feel Special:** In a busy household, having something that is uniquely *yours* is a wonderful feeling. It’s a small detail that makes each person—from the youngest child to the grandparents and even the family pet—feel included and celebrated.
*   **Elevates Your Festive Decor:** Let's be honest, a set of beautifully coordinated, personalised stockings looks stunning. They add a layer of sophistication and warmth to your mantelpiece that generic stockings simply can't match.
*   **Perfect for All Ages:** This isn't just a kids' thing! A personalised stocking for an adult can reflect their hobbies, a favourite quote, or a special nickname, making it a thoughtful gift in itself.

1ou72y4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_LiveMates-AE/comments/1ou72y4/why_finding_a_compatible_roommate_matters_more/,Why Finding a Compatible Roommate Matters More Than Location,"When people start looking for a place to live in Dubai, the first thing they usually obsess over is location — Downtown, JVC, Dubai Marina, Business Bay. It’s understandable. Everyone wants to be close to work, to the metro, or to their favorite coffee spot. But after years of talking with expats and renters through LiveMates, we’ve noticed something interesting: it’s not where you live that defines your comfort. It’s who you live with.

A great roommate can make even a modest apartment in an unfashionable area feel like home. A bad one can turn a dream address into a daily headache. We’ve seen both — from people who’ve stayed friends with their flatmates for years to those who packed up and moved out within a week.

# Compatibility over convenience

When you first arrive in Dubai, you might not think much about “compatibility.” You’re focused on rent prices, commute times, and whether there’s a Carrefour nearby. But sharing a space is a lot like being in a mini relationship — it’s built on habits, communication, and respect.

We’ve had users tell us stories of moving into a gorgeous apartment near DIFC with someone who looked great on paper — similar age, similar job — only to find out they had completely different lifestyles. One person worked night shifts, the other was up at 6 a.m. for the gym. They ended up living in the same space but on different planets.

Meanwhile, another user shared a flat in Discovery Gardens with someone they met through a Facebook group. The place wasn’t fancy, but the two clicked instantly — same sense of humor, similar daily rhythms, shared values about keeping the space tidy. Two years later, they’re still living together.

Compatibility doesn’t mean being identical. It’s about understanding each other’s space and rhythm. Some people want to hang out with their flatmates — dinners, Netflix nights, occasional nights out. Others just want peace, privacy, and mutual respect. Both are fine, as long as everyone’s clear from the start.

# What really defines a good match

From our community’s experience, three things matter most:

1. **Lifestyle balance.** Are your schedules and energy levels somewhat aligned? A night owl and an early riser can work — but only if both respect boundaries.
2. **Cleanliness expectations.** This one ruins more flatshares than you’d think. Talk about it before moving in. Is the apartment “tidy” or just “not a disaster”? The definition varies wildly.
3. **Communication style.** Some people talk things out right away. Others let irritation build. We’ve seen that most roommate conflicts aren’t about the mess or the noise — they’re about how problems are handled (or ignored).

And here’s a small but crucial point: compatibility doesn’t mean constant harmony. Even good roommates will occasionally annoy each other. What matters is whether you can talk it through without drama.

# Lessons from the LiveMates community

After analyzing dozens of roommate stories, here are a few takeaways we’ve seen come up again and again:

* **People who discuss boundaries early stay together longer.** Simple talks about cleaning, guests, or shared items save a lot of friction later.
* **Living with someone from a different background often works surprisingly well.** When there’s no assumption that you’ll think alike, you both tend to communicate more clearly.
* **Sometimes moving a few metro stops away is worth it.** We’ve had users who chose a slightly less central location just to live with someone who felt like a good fit — and they ended up happier and more settled.

The trade-off between location and compatibility comes down to what kind of daily life you want. A central apartment can save time, but a peaceful home can save sanity. If you’re constantly stressed about arguments, noise, or tension, no skyline view will make up for it.

# A few simple tips before choosing a roommate

1. **Have an honest chat before signing anything.** Ask about daily routines, guests, work hours, even small habits like smoking or cooking.
2. **Trust your instincts.** If something feels off during the first meeting, don’t ignore it. Living together will only amplify it.
3. **Write things down.** Even a casual written agreement can prevent misunderstandings later — who pays for cleaning, how bills are split, etc.

At the end of the day, where you live matters less than *how* you live there. A compatible roommate brings a sense of ease that no perfect location can buy.

We’ve seen this pattern over and over again in Dubai — people who focus on human chemistry instead of postal codes end up staying longer, saving money, and actually enjoying their shared homes.

# Auroville – Where Silence Becomes a Friend

**Peaceful international township for solo travelers near Pondicherry.**

If there’s one place every solo traveler should start, it’s **Auroville**. Built around the golden Matrimandir, this eco-township is designed for people seeking purpose and quiet. You can meditate, volunteer at organic farms, or just cycle through red-earth trails that feel like a world of their own.

The people are kind, conversations are easy, and the sense of time — almost meditative. Don’t be surprised if you lose track of it completely.

**Why Visit:**

* Perfect for spiritual reflection or digital detox.  
* Free meditation sessions and yoga workshops.  
* Pet-friendly guesthouses and organic eateries.  



# Rock Beach – The Heartbeat of Every Solo Evening

**Safe and scenic promenade beach in the center of Pondicherry.**

Evenings in Pondy are incomplete without a walk at **Rock Beach**. Street musicians play softly, food stalls serve crunchy sundal and roasted corn, and the sea hums a rhythm of its own.

It’s one of the safest places to be alone after dark — always buzzing but never chaotic. If you enjoy people-watching or quiet reflection, this is your spot.

**Why Visit:**

* Safe for solo walks at night.  
* Street food, sea breeze, and sunset glow.  
* Located close to cafés and shopping lanes.  



# Café Des Arts – For Creative Souls on a Coffee Break

**Vintage French café in White Town, perfect for solo travelers.**

If you’ve ever romanticized reading a book alone in a café, **Café Des Arts** will feel like home. Set in a yellow colonial building, its courtyard hums with chatter and camera clicks. You can spend hours sketching, journaling, or sipping cold coffee under the canopy of vines — no one rushes you here.

And if you’re open to meeting fellow travelers, you’ll often find writers, photographers, and solo wanderers sharing tables.

**Why Visit:**

* Pet-friendly and photogenic interiors.  
* French breakfasts and strong coffee.  
* Great for journaling or working remotely.  



# Le Café – For Late-Night Coffee by the Bay

**24-hour beachfront café on the Promenade, Pondicherry.**

Few places in India offer a midnight coffee with the ocean for company — but **Le Café** does. Once a French port office, this 24-hour spot now serves as a cozy refuge for late-night thinkers, readers, and loners.

The waves are loud, the lights soft, and the sound of French music drifts from passing bikes. It’s peaceful, cinematic, and feels almost like a secret.

**Why Visit:**

* Open 24 hours; perfect for night owls.  
* Ocean-facing seating.  
* Ideal for solo travelers seeking quiet reflection.  



# Serenity Beach – Sunrise for the Brave (and Barefoot)

**Peaceful beach near Kottakuppam, ideal for solo meditation and surfing.**

Every solo trip needs a sunrise memory. For that, head to **Serenity Beach**. With golden sands and early-morning surfers, it’s the best place to start your day with salt, silence, and sun.

Local surf schools like *Kallialay Surf Club* welcome first-timers, so you can learn to surf or just sit with chai watching the tide roll in.

**Why Visit:**

* Safe and uncrowded in early mornings.  
* Surf schools nearby.  
* Perfect for photography and journaling.  



#  Maison Perumal – Where Solo Luxury Feels Intimate

**Heritage boutique hotel in Tamil Quarters, Pondicherry.**

If you want to treat yourself after a week of hostels and scooter rides, check into **Maison Perumal**, a 130-year-old Chettiar mansion. With just ten rooms, its staff feels more like family than service.

You can have breakfast in the courtyard while the monsoon drizzle hits the tiles — or chat with the chef about Creole cuisine. It’s solo travel at its most soulful.

**Why Visit:**

* Quiet, heritage-style accommodation.  
* Authentic Tamil and Creole food.  
* Great for reflection and writing retreats.  



# Local Tips for Traveling Solo in Pondy

1. **Stay in White Town or Heritage Quarters** – Safe, central, and walkable.  
2. **Rent a scooter** – Easy to explore hidden beaches and temples.  
3. **Keep cash handy** – Smaller cafés and stalls may not accept cards.  
4. **Use trusted apps** – *Ola* and *Rapido* are available in most parts of town.  
5. **Join community spaces** – Auroville’s Youth Centre or cafés like *Eat My Cake* often host events perfect for meeting people.  



# Conclusion

Pondicherry rewards those who travel alone — not with luxury, but with stillness. It’s a city that gives you the space to breathe, to think, to rediscover yourself without distraction.

Walk, write, eat, sleep — at your own rhythm. Because in Pondicherry, solitude doesn’t mean silence — it means hearing yourself clearly again.

I was curious what neighborhood we should stay in?

Here’s some notes/questions:
- Family of 4 with young school age kids
- I’m into running so looking for a neighborhood with nearby running trails to train for the marathon
- I like dense walkable neighborhoods since we won’t have a car, for reference we really like the upper west side given its balance of family friendly, bars/restaurants/coffee shop density, easy grocery shopping, and nearby to Central Park.
- My wife and really likes aerial fitness (hammocks/silks yoga like acrobatics), any options around?
- We like museums, musical performances, fun bars, variety of foods
- Are there winter day camp options for the month of August for the kids?",0,1762860054.0,AskAnAustralian,2,0.33,False

Her shift ends when my shift starts, so I start my workday with her complaining about her coworkers and everything else. She is very negative.
She thinks she is the only one working.
I believed what she was saying, maybe her coworkers were lazy. 
One day I ended up working in the same shift as her and she will not sit down for a coffee break, she wants to do everything very fast and she thinks she is the only one holding everything together at work. She was also checking my work and what I was doing. 
After that I was tired of her negativity. It is not nice to start my shif this way. So yesterday I told her ""maybe you should find another job"".
She ran away crying.

Long story short- We do not have the best relationship. He lives at home with our parents, doesn’t pay rent, refuses to get a job, and rarely does anything around the house. He’s leeches off parents- eats their food (my parents now hide snacks they want to keep), their electricity bill is sky high due to his incessant gaming, and he’s generally a mean spirited person to be around. He once had a job 10 years ago but it wasn’t “convenient” so he quit. 
He is abrasive, rude and manipulative. The thing is; he is perfectly polite to strangers and is miraculously is pleasant to be around just before his birthday and Christmas. 
Anyway my parents have fought over the years as Dad would love to chuck him out and Mum refuses. So now, they are purchasing him a house, and saying it’ll be his inheritance. The thing is, this will curtail my parents lifestyle which is not extravagant by any means, but stop them doing everything they want to. I also don’t believe my brother could manage his money alone so he will inevitably be asking for handouts every month. 
I feel so angry and upset by this and I’m not sure it’s justified. It’s their money. I don’t want them to give me money, and I always assumed everything would be split evenly down the road anyway. 
I guess I feel that I’ve always done everything that was expected and he literally does nothing. I had a part time job in school, got a degree, always worked, got married, had kids. Meanwhile if he so much as puts the bins out my mother acts like he’s done something amazing. He has never had to do anything. 
But it’s not like my parents have never supported me- they have helped us both equally over the years with cars, holiday expenses etc. I also know it’s not dad, he just wants him out any way possible. Since they announced this, my mother has been insisting on paying for coffees, meals etc for me even though I’m perfectly capable and it just makes me angrier even though I’ve not said anything.

# Satsanga Café

**Pet-friendly French café in White Town, Pondicherry.**

A leafy escape tucked into the heart of White Town, **Satsanga Café** is where both you and your pup can unwind after a long walk by the beach. The open courtyard, shaded by bougainvillea, makes it a perfect brunch stop for pet parents.

My beagle, Oreo, was greeted with a bowl of water before I even ordered my mushroom crepes and iced coffee — that’s the kind of hospitality that keeps you coming back.

**Why Visit:**

* Calm, pet-friendly outdoor space.  
* Fresh European menu with vegan options.  
* Located close to Rock Beach.  



# The Storytellers’ Café – Promenade Hotel

**Pet-friendly luxury café with a sea view, near Rock Beach Pondicherry.**

Located along the seaside promenade, **The Storytellers’ Café** inside the Promenade Hotel is one of the few upscale spots that allows pets (in their outdoor seating area). Watching the sunset over the Bay of Bengal while your furry companion naps beside your chair? That’s peak Pondy romance.

**Why Visit:**

* Perfect sea-view dining for pet parents.  
* Upscale Indo-French menu.  
* Located right beside Rock Beach and the promenade walkway.  



# Serenity Beach

**Pet-friendly beach in Pondicherry for sunrise walks and surf waves.**

Just 15 minutes from the town center, **Serenity Beach** is where you’ll meet locals walking their dogs at dawn. The early morning sea breeze, soft sand, and fewer crowds make it a safe and scenic space for off-leash runs.

If your pup loves water, this is paradise. Bring a frisbee, some treats, and a towel — they’ll thank you later.

**Why Visit:**

* Pet-friendly and uncrowded.  
* Sunrise views and golden sand stretch.  
* Close to cafés like Nalla’s Kitchen and Auroville Bakery.  



#  Café des Arts

**Pet-friendly art café in White Town, Pondicherry.**

It’s hard to talk about Pondy cafés without mentioning **Café des Arts** — and yes, it’s pet-friendly! The open-air courtyard, vintage French interiors, and colorful murals make it a great hangout for creative souls (and their equally curious pets).

I’ve seen Labradors sprawled beside their owners while artists sketched on vintage benches — it’s a vibe you’ll want to soak in.

**Why Visit:**

* Iconic Instagram café with pet access.  
* Artsy courtyard with French charm.  
* Serves breakfast till noon — don’t miss the banana crepes.  



# Auroville Guesthouses & Eco Stays

**Pet-friendly homestays and eco-lodges in Auroville, Pondicherry.**

If you want a longer getaway, Auroville has dozens of **pet-friendly stays** tucked within its forest trails. From eco-lodges like *Mango Hill* and *Sharnga Guesthouse* to rustic cottages like *Bamboo Centre Stay*, pets are welcomed as part of the family.

You’ll find large green spaces, clean water access, and even community trails where pets roam freely (under supervision).

**Why Visit:**

* Eco-stays with open spaces and forest paths.  
* Healthy vegetarian food options.  
* Pet-friendly rooms and policies.  



# Villa Krish – Boutique Stay for Pet Parents

**Pet-friendly boutique hotel near Rock Beach, Pondicherry.**

Located a minute’s walk from the Promenade, **Villa Krish** blends comfort with charm — and your pet will love it too. The staff is incredibly accommodating, offering water bowls and cozy corners for your four-legged friends.

You can step out for an early morning beach walk and return for a rooftop breakfast with sea breeze views.

**Why Visit:**

* Boutique luxury stay that welcomes pets.  
* Rooftop restaurant with sea view.  
* Walkable distance from Rock Beach.  



# Local Tips for Traveling with Pets in Pondy

1. **Carry a pet mat** — Many cafés have tiled floors that can get hot during the day.  
2. **Morning is better** — Beaches and streets are quieter for walks before 9 AM.  
3. **Keep vet contacts handy:** *Blue Cross Veterinary Clinic (Mission Street)* is one of the most reliable in town.  
4. **Book pet stays early** — Many homestays have limited pet-friendly rooms.  
5. **Avoid the afternoon heat** — White Town can get too warm for long outdoor sessions.  



# Conclusion

Pondicherry isn’t just a coastal town for couples and café-hoppers anymore — it’s evolving into a haven for pet parents. From cozy cafés to open beaches and boutique stays, there’s a growing space where wagging tails are truly welcome.

So the next time you plan your Pondy trip, skip the kennel guilt — bring your furry friend along. Trust me, they’ll enjoy the *croissants and coastline* as much as you do.

  
If you’re the kind of traveler who believes no trip is complete without your furry best friend, Pondicherry will surprise you.

Nashville: 
- hit up Java Jacks Coffee House in Nacogdoches, best croissant breakfast sammie’s, decent coffee. 
- I’d go through Little Rock for the best wings at The Lost Forty Brewery. 
- Memphis: Sun Studio, check in on the ducks at the Peabody Hotel (funny story) 
- Nashville: bluebird cafe, Biscuit Love is amazing for breakfast/brunch, Grand Ole Opry and all the other Nashville stuff. 
- personally, I’d make the extra hour and a half drive to Cummins Falls to hike to the falls again - it’s a great hike. 

Big Bend National Park: 
- San Antonio: I’d check to make sure the Alamo is still there and walk a little bit of the Riverwalk to stretch my legs, The Esquire Tavern for lunch. 
- stop in Marfa to check in on the Prada store. 
- BBNP: The Window, Santa Elena Canyon, and then anything and everything else you’re interested in. Just get lost in all of it. 
-Terlingua is where I’d stay, cute town; if I didn’t stay in the park.

Your toddler wants to play in the soft zone, your pre-teen wants adventure, your teen wants something “not boring,” and you? Well, you want a coffee and a moment of peace where no one’s whining.

That’s where [**Altitude Trampoline Park**](https://www.altitudedelmar.com/) changes the game. It’s a family fun center designed for every generation under one glow-lit roof. Whether you’re 4, 14, or 40, there’s something here that’ll make you laugh, move, and rediscover that childlike joy.

So, let’s dive into why Altitude is the ultimate answer to the age-old question, “What are some fun things to do with kids near me that everyone will enjoy?”

# 1. Toddlers

Let’s start with the tiniest and often busiest ones, toddlers.

If you’re a parent, you already know toddlers come with two default settings: endless energy and zero fear. That’s why Altitude’s [**Toddler Zone**](https://www.altitudedelmar.com/Altitude-Trampoline-Park-Delmar-Maryland) is pure gold.

It’s a safe, soft-play area built just for little explorers, no big kids zooming past, no hard surfaces, and no overstimulation. Just colorful trampolines, mini foam pits, and friendly staff who know how to keep the little ones giggling, while you can actually sit back and breathe for a second.

They get to jump, tumble, and climb without a care in the world, and you get to enjoy watching them discover new moves and confidence, one bounce at a time.

**Parent Bonus:** It’s also a fantastic way to improve balance, coordination, and motor skills, all while they think they’re “just playing.” Win-win.

# 2. Kids

This is where the magic really starts. For kids, Altitude is a wonderland of “What should we do next?” moments. They can race through the Battle Beam, fly into the Foam Pit, shoot hoops on the Slam Dunk Zone, or bounce between wall-to-wall trampolines until their cheeks turn red from laughter.

Every zone feels like a mini adventure, challenging enough to keep them curious but safe enough to give parents peace of mind.

But here’s what makes it even better... Kids aren’t just burning energy, they’re building friendships, jumping together, cheering each other on, and laughing mid-air. It’s playtime that builds real social skills.

And because Altitude hosts special themed days like Glow Nights and Open Jump Sessions, your little ones can experience a new twist every visit.

Imagine your child’s face lighting up under black lights, dancing to music, surrounded by glowing smiles - that’s the kind of moment that sticks.

# 3. Pre-Teens

Pre-teens are at that in-between age, too big for “kiddie stuff” but not quite ready for teen hangouts. They want to feel grown-up but still have fun.

Altitude hits that perfect balance.

The Dodgeball Arena turns ordinary jumping into an adrenaline-packed showdown. The Wipeout Zone brings out their competitive streak in the best way possible. Picture them laughing as they duck, jump, and try not to get knocked off the spinning arm.

And then there’s the Climbing Wall, the ultimate test of strength, strategy, and confidence. It’s not just physical fun, it’s personal growth disguised as play.

By the end, you’ll see them standing a little taller. Proud of what they conquered, sweaty, smiling, and already saying, “Can we come again next weekend?”

# 4. Teens

Let’s be honest, teens can be the hardest to please. You suggest a “[**family fun adventure**](https://www.altitudedelmar.com/page.cfm?pageid=62517&articleid=40591),” and they roll their eyes before you’ve even finished the sentence.

But the moment they walk into Altitude with the music pumping, neon lights glowing, and friends waiting. Suddenly, it’s cool again.

The Main Court is a playground for flips, tricks, and **indoor trampoline** parkour. The Slam Dunk Basketball Zone gives them a chance to showcase their skills and post a few slow-motion jumps on their social media.

And when Glow Night rolls around, it’s their time to shine literally. The lights go down, the DJ turns up, and the trampoline park becomes a dance floor in the sky.

It’s movement, music, and freedom. The perfect combination to get teens laughing, bonding, and actually wanting to hang out with their family again.

# 5. Parents

Let’s talk about the heroes behind every family outing, you.

At Altitude, parents aren’t just spectators sitting on the sidelines. Unless you want to be, of course, you can jump right in and be a part of all the fun or take a well-deserved break in the lounge area, snack bar, or café space.

If you choose to jump, you’ll quickly realize two things

1. It’s a surprisingly good workout (rebounding burns calories faster than running).
2. It’s not possible to stay in a bad mood when you’re bouncing and laughing with your kids.

And if you choose to sit back? You’ll love watching your kids play, connect, and be their joyful selves. **Trampoline Parks** are for families who want to make the most of time together without the chaos of traditional outings.

# 6. Grandparents

Altitude isn’t just multi-generational in theory, it truly welcomes everyone. Many grandparents come along to watch, cheer, and even capture photos and videos.

The comfortable seating areas, friendly staff, and inclusive atmosphere make it an easy and enjoyable outing for the entire crew. And when they see their grandkids laughing, jumping, and bonding. That’s the kind of memory that lasts.

Some even join in for a gentle bounce session, proving that fun has no expiration date.

# Why Families Love Coming Back To Arcade Nearby

Ask any parent who’s been to Altitude, and they’ll tell you the same thing, ""It’s the only place where everyone in the family is happy and tired by the end of the day.""

It’s the kind of destination that becomes part of your weekend rhythm. Rainy days, birthdays, celebrations, or just a need for energy release, Altitude fits every mood and moment.

And honestly, in a world where everyone’s juggling busy schedules and screens, finding a place where your whole family can connect is a challenge.

# Final Comments

From toddlers finding their first bounce to teens perfecting their flips, from parents laughing mid-jump to grandparents capturing memories. Altitude is where smiles happen naturally. It’s not about perfection. It’s about presence.

And that’s what makes it special. Every jump, every laugh, every “one more round!” moment turns an ordinary day into something unforgettable.

So next time you’re searching for “[**fun things to do with kids near me**](https://www.altitudedelmar.com/Altitude-Trampoline-Park-Delmar-Maryland),” skip the screens and pick the place where your family can truly come alive. Because no matter your age, there’s one universal truth, ""We’re all happiest when we’re jumping together.""",1,1762859665.0,u_Open-Discipline-8795,0,1.0,False

I live in Ipswich with my partner and our cat. I moved here for her. The girlfriend, I mean, not the cat. Although the cat is a nice bonus. All of my friends I see in person are her friends, who've been really kind in welcoming me into their circle. We go on holiday together and all sorts of good stuff, but sometimes you just need to have friends of your own. This is where you come in, hopefully!

To give you a small overview of what I'm like, I'm more than capable of laughing at myself and I'm into football (I play 5 a side when I'm not injured - which is worryingly often and I'm starting to believe I might be made of Quavers), reading, writing but never finishing anything I start, music (my taste is varied), photography, crime dramas, true crime, and I've recently decided to start collecting Pokemon cards again. Politically, I am left-leaning. That doesn't mean I'm loony left, but I'm also most definitely not a Tory. There's nuance to this stuff!

Anyway, I'd love to find someone who needs a bestie, male or female, to chat to regularly and meet up for coffees/pints every now and then (possibly regularly if we get on well) and do all the usual stuff good friends would do.

1ou6m0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/TreksEverestbasecamp/comments/1ou6m0i/what_kind_of_food_is_served_during_the_everest/,What kind of food is served during the Everest Base Camp Trek?,"The **Everest Base Camp (EBC) Trek** is not just a journey to one of the most iconic trekking destinations in the world, but also a culinary adventure in the heart of the Himalayas. For many trekkers, understanding the type of food served during the trek is crucial, as it affects energy levels, health, and overall trekking experience. Here’s a comprehensive guide to the food options, quality, and tips for eating well while trekking to Everest Base Camp.

# 1. The Role of Food on the Everest Base Camp Trek

Trekking to **Everest Base Camp** is physically demanding. Most trekkers walk for **6–8 hours daily**, often at high altitudes ranging from 2,800 meters in Lukla to over 5,300 meters at EBC. Proper nutrition is essential to maintain stamina, prevent altitude sickness, and stay warm. Foods are mostly served in **teahouses and lodges**, as there are no large restaurants in the high Himalayas.

# 2. Typical Meals During the Trek

**Breakfast:**  
Most teahouses offer **hearty breakfasts** to fuel a long day of trekking. Common options include:

* **Porridge (oatmeal, rice, or cornmeal)** – served with sugar, milk, or butter.
* **Eggs** – boiled, scrambled, or omelets.
* **Bread, toast, and pancakes** – often served with jam, honey, or butter.
* **Tea or coffee** – including traditional **Nepali milk tea** or **green tea**.

Breakfast is often light but high in carbohydrates to provide **long-lasting energy** for the trek ahead.

**Lunch:**  
Lunch is usually taken on the trail or in a teahouse along the route. Popular choices include:

* **Dal Bhat (lentil soup with rice)** – the staple Nepali meal, often served with vegetables and pickles.
* **Thukpa (Tibetan noodle soup)** – warm, filling, and perfect for cold weather.
* **Momos (dumplings)** – steamed or fried, stuffed with vegetables, chicken, or buffalo.
* **Sandwiches and instant noodles** – for a quick energy boost on the trail.

**Dinner:**  
After a long day of trekking, dinner is served in teahouses. Options are similar to lunch but usually more **filling and warming**:

* **Dal Bhat with curry and vegetables** – high in protein and carbs.
* **Fried rice or noodles** – with eggs or vegetables.
* **Potatoes, soups, and stews** – ideal for replenishing energy and warmth.
* **Tea, hot chocolate, or coffee** – helps relax and hydrate before sleeping.

# 3. Snacks and Energy Foods on the Trek

Trekkers often carry **energy bars, nuts, chocolate, and dried fruits** to snack between meals. These are convenient for a quick calorie boost during long hiking hours, especially above **4,000 meters**, where appetite can decrease due to altitude.

# 4. Drinks During the Everest Base Camp Trek

Hydration is critical at high altitude. Common drinks include:

* **Water (boiled or treated)** – always recommended to avoid waterborne illnesses.
* **Hot lemon tea** – refreshing and warming.
* **Instant coffee or chocolate** – for caffeine and energy.
* **Soft drinks** – though less common in remote areas.

Avoid excessive alcohol or caffeine, as they can **dehydrate the body** and worsen altitude sickness.

# 5. Dietary Considerations

Teahouses accommodate most diets:

* **Vegetarian options** – widely available.
* **Vegan or gluten-free options** – possible in larger villages, but limited in remote areas.
* **Meat** – mostly chicken, yak, or occasionally goat; beef is rare due to local customs.

If you have special dietary needs, it’s best to **carry your own supplements or snacks**.

# 6. Food Quality and Pricing

Food quality varies depending on location:

* **Lower villages (Lukla to Namche Bazaar)** – more variety and slightly cheaper.
* **Higher villages (above Dingboche, Lobuche, Gorak Shep)** – limited menu, slightly higher prices due to transportation costs.

A typical **meal cost** ranges from **$10–$40 USD**, with dal bhat being the most economical and filling option.

# 7. Tips for Eating Well on the Everest Base Camp Trek

1. **Eat local foods like dal bhat** – provides energy and is easier on the stomach.
2. **Stay hydrated** – drink plenty of water and hot drinks.
3. **Avoid raw salads at high altitudes** – to reduce the risk of digestive issues.
4. **Carry snacks** – nuts, chocolate, or energy bars are handy on long trekking days.
5. **Start with smaller meals at high altitudes** – appetite can decrease as you ascend.

# Conclusion

Food on the **Everest Base Camp Trek** is a delightful mix of **Nepali, Tibetan, and Western cuisines**, designed to provide **maximum energy and comfort**. From hearty **dal bhat** to steaming **momos**, every meal is an essential part of the trekking experience. Whether you are a vegetarian, meat-lover, or vegan, the high-altitude teahouses cater to most dietary needs, making sure that your focus stays on the **breathtaking Himalayan views** rather than hunger.

For anyone planning the **Everest Base Camp trek**, knowing what to eat and how to fuel your body is as important as your trekking gear. Proper nutrition ensures not only energy but also a **safe, enjoyable, and unforgettable adventure** in the Himalayas.",1,1762858963.0,TreksEverestbasecamp,0,1.0,False
1ou6lh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ou6lh0/my_experience_2_weeks_sober/,My experience - 2 weeks sober,"I (41M) have been drinking heavily since COVID, and in the past 2-3 years I’ve been averaging a bottle of spirits (700ml) each night. I generally don’t get hangovers, and for a mild headache, Ibuprofen works wonders for me. I’d drink until 2am in the morning and then sleep until midday or longer. Then I’d repeat the cycle starting at 8pm that night. I never had urges to day drink but I loved to drink at night, watch movies and YouTube videos.

I used to drink whiskey but in the past 6 months I switched to gin.

Anyway, a few weeks ago I decided enough is enough. My wife, who is very patient and cool-headed, was becoming increasingly concerned, and I was starting to get worried I would do fatal damage to my organs if I kept it up.

Days 1-5: Constant fatigue, also experiencing hypnic jerks during night sleep. These ceased at around the 5th/6th day sober.

Days 5-10: still very lethargic, although I’m getting a growing sense of pride that I’m keeping it up. Sleep is still short and I’m having midday naps due to my sleepiness. No cravings at night - I drink lots of tea, coffee, water and sugar-free soda though.

Day 10: had a long afternoon nap and afterwards I felt the most refreshed that I’ve felt since ceasing alcohol.

Days 10-13: developed a pretty bad cold. Sleeping better, eating healthy but the chesty cough is rough as.

I’m wondering if my immune system is weak and if alcohol has been masking colds and bugs etc, and now that I’m sober, I feel it more?

In any case, I’m really happy with where I’m at and I believe I can keep it up.

Just wanted to share! Thanks for listening :)

While Dispatch is universally praised for it's storytelling, animation and acting, people have rightfully mentioned that the actual gameplay part of the game feels like the weakest one.

The dispatching is actually quite fun and it has a lot of interesting mechanics with sinergy and powers and hacking and all of that. But at some point you just wait for it to end so that the story can move forward. Because it does not matter. You can just go for a coffee and miss every single call – the game will still tell you that's the best shift the Z team has ever had and continue on. So here are my suggestions on how to improve that – in case we do actually get a second season or a similar game in the future.

- There need to be some stakes. The dispatch sections need a game over condition: miss/fail too many calls or get all of your heroes downed, you lose, start the section again

- For the game over condition to matter, there needs to be a bit more challenge: more calls, tough decisions where you cannot cover everything, some risk

- Minor narrative consequences of doing well or not so well: add some lines of dialog from the heroes for different success rates: ooh, barely made it! Or wow, that went great, thanks Robert! Maybe update the leaderboard? Show that the Z team is not on the bottom anymore?

- More frequent and more incremental dispatcher ""level ups"": right now we only have three levels and I'm pretty sure everyone got them by the end of ep.6 or earlier regardless of the performance

Maybe your kitchen counter is precious real estate. Perhaps you're setting up a dorm room, an office kitchenette, or an RV. Or maybe you just don't see the point in having a massive, hulking appliance when a smaller one will do the job just fine.

I get it. A lot of us are dealing with smaller kitchens these days, and every inch counts. The good news is that ""small"" no longer means ""weak"" or ""useless."" Today's small microwaves are powerful, packed with smart features, and can be a true kitchen hero.

This guide is here to help you cut through the noise and find the perfect compact microwave that fits your space, your budget, and your cooking habits.

---

## Why a Small Microwave Makes Sense

Let's be real—the benefits are pretty obvious, but it's good to start by reminding ourselves why we're on this path. Choosing a smaller model is a smart move for several reasons.

-   **Saves Precious Counter Space:** This is the big one. A compact footprint frees up room for food prep, a coffee maker, or just a clean, uncluttered look.
-   **Energy Efficient:** Smaller ovens generally use less power to run. It's a small win for your electricity bill and the environment.
-   **Perfect for Specific Lifestyles:** They're a must-have for dorms, apartments, office break rooms, and even for use in a master suite or basement bar.
-   **Less Intimidating:** Let's face it, sometimes you just want to nuke some leftovers or make popcorn without being confronted by a dozen complicated buttons and a touch screen.

## What to Really Look For When Shopping

Not all small microwaves are created equal. Here’s a checklist of things to keep in mind before you click ""buy.""

### ### Size and Dimensions: The Golden Rule

This is the most common mistake people make. They buy a microwave that *looks* small online, only to find it doesn't fit in their designated spot.

> **Pro Tip:** Grab a tape measure *before* you even start shopping.
>
> Measure the **Width, Depth, and Height** of the space you have available. But don't stop there! Add at least **one inch of clearance** on the sides and back, and **several inches on top** for proper ventilation. Trust me, your microwave needs to breathe, or it will overheat and die a premature death.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=small%20microwave)

Also, look at the internal capacity (measured in cubic feet) and the size of the turntable. A 0.7 cubic foot microwave is common, but if you want to heat up a dinner plate or a small casserole dish, you might want to look for a 0.9 or 1.0 cubic foot model.

### ### Wattage: The Power Behind the Pop

Wattage is what determines how quickly and evenly your food cooks.

-   **700-800 Watts:** This is the standard for most compact microwaves. It's perfectly fine for reheating drinks, defrosting, and making simple meals. You'll just need to add a little extra time compared to a larger model.
-   **900+ Watts:** If you can find a compact model with 900 watts or more, you're in great shape. This will give you faster, more even cooking that rivals its bigger siblings.

Don't sacrifice too much power for a slightly smaller footprint. Anything below 700 watts can feel frustratingly slow.

### ### Features vs. Simplicity

Think about what you *actually* use a microwave for.

-   **The Essentials:** Defrost (by weight or time), a popcorn button, and variable power levels are must-haves.
-   **The Nice-to-Haves:** Sensor cooking automatically adjusts the time and power based on the steam released by the food. It's surprisingly accurate and great for things like potatoes or frozen vegetables.
-   **The Advanced Stuff:** Some small models come with convection, grilling, or air frying capabilities. These are fantastic if you're trying to get more functionality out of a single appliance, but they also add to the cost and complexity.

Be honest with yourself. If all you do is reheat coffee and make ramen, you don't need a model that can bake a cake.

## A Little Secret I Wish I'd Known Sooner

When I was outfitting my first tiny apartment, I thought my choice was between a ""reheat-only"" microwave and no microwave at all. I wish someone had told me about compact microwave/convection oven combos.

*This one thing changed my entire cooking game.*

Instead of just a microwave, I got a slightly boxier but still very compact appliance that worked as both a microwave *and* a small, high-quality convection oven. Suddenly, I wasn't just reheating soup. I was baking small batches of cookies, roasting chicken breasts, and making crispy, perfectly-baked potatoes.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=small%20microwave)

It completely eliminated the need for a separate toaster oven, saving me counter space and money in the long run. If you live in a small space and love to cook even a little, looking into a **compact microwave with convection** is an absolute game-changer. It takes the concept of a small appliance from ""just enough"" to ""incredibly capable.""

Your connection drops. When you reconnect, you've been voted out and accused of being suspicious. Sound familiar? This frustrating scenario happens more often than it should in Among Us, and it's not always because of your internet connection.

Among Us remains impressively popular in 2025, maintaining over 20 million monthly active players despite being released years ago. But with millions of players across mobile, PC, and console platforms, the game's peer-to-peer connection system creates unique security vulnerabilities that most players don't even realize exist. Your IP address becomes visible to other players in your lobby, which opens the door to targeted attacks, harassment, and connection disruptions from toxic players who don't take losing well.

After extensively testing fifteen different VPN services specifically with Among Us across multiple platforms, we've identified the providers that actually deliver what gamers need: protection from attacks without introducing lag, the ability to play from restricted networks, and genuine privacy during voice chat sessions. This isn't about using a VPN to gain unfair advantages. This is about protecting yourself while enjoying one of gaming's most social experiences.

# Quick Overview: Top 3 VPNs for Among Us

Before diving deep into why you need a VPN for Among Us and how to choose the right one, here are our top three recommendations based on rigorous testing:

**NordVPN** stands out as the overall best choice for Among Us players. During our testing, it consistently delivered the lowest latency across all platforms we tested, with ping times averaging below 100ms on nearby servers. The proprietary NordLynx protocol, which builds on WireGuard technology, maintained speeds of 418 Mbps on average without compromising the military-grade encryption protecting your connection. With over 6,000 servers across 61 countries, you'll always find a fast connection close to your location, which matters significantly for real-time multiplayer gaming where every millisecond counts.

**Surfshark** offers exceptional value for Among Us players, especially if you game across multiple devices or share your subscription with family members. The service provides unlimited simultaneous connections, which means you can protect your phone, tablet, PC, and gaming console all at once without juggling device limits. Performance remains impressive, with our local server tests reaching 904 Mbps and maintaining 96% speed retention, far more than enough bandwidth for smooth Among Us gameplay even while voice chatting. At under three dollars per month for long-term plans, it delivers premium protection without premium pricing.

**ExpressVPN** earned its spot as the fastest VPN we tested for Among Us, averaging 399 Mbps across diverse server locations and maintaining exceptional stability during extended gaming sessions. The Lightway protocol lives up to its name, adding minimal overhead to your connection while providing robust encryption. The service costs more than competitors, but the combination of speed, reliability, and user-friendly apps across every platform makes it worth considering if you prioritize performance above all else and don't mind paying a premium for it.

# Why You Need a VPN for Among Us

Understanding why a VPN matters for Among Us requires looking at how the game actually works under the hood, which reveals vulnerabilities that most casual players never consider.

# The Peer-to-Peer Connection Problem

Unlike many modern games that route all traffic through dedicated game servers, Among Us uses peer-to-peer connections for much of its functionality. This architectural choice keeps costs down for Innersloth and reduces latency in many scenarios, but it comes with a significant privacy trade-off. When you join an Among Us lobby, your device establishes direct connections with other players' devices, which means your IP address becomes visible to anyone with basic technical knowledge and the right tools.

Think of your IP address like your home address on the internet. Just as someone with your physical address could find your house, someone with your IP address can identify your approximate geographic location and, more concerning for gamers, launch targeted attacks against your connection. In the context of Among Us, this creates real risks that go beyond theoretical security concerns.

# DDoS Attacks Are More Common Than You Think

Distributed Denial of Service attacks might sound like something that only happens to major corporations, but they've become disturbingly common in competitive gaming environments. A player who's losing can use readily available tools to flood your connection with traffic, overwhelming your home router and causing your game to lag or disconnect entirely. In Among Us, where accusation dynamics and social deduction create intense emotional moments, we've seen numerous reports of players weaponizing DDoS attacks to eliminate opponents or retaliate for perceived slights.

The impact extends beyond just losing a single game. Repeated attacks can disrupt your entire internet connection, affecting everyone in your household and potentially causing issues with your Internet Service Provider if attacks are severe enough. By connecting through a VPN, you shield your real IP address behind the VPN server's address, which means would-be attackers waste their time hitting heavily protected VPN infrastructure instead of your vulnerable home connection.

# Bypassing Network Restrictions

If you've ever tried to play Among Us at school, work, or on public WiFi and found the game blocked, you've experienced network restrictions firsthand. Educational institutions and workplace networks often block gaming traffic to prevent distractions, while some public WiFi providers restrict certain types of connections to manage bandwidth. These blocks typically work by identifying the game's traffic patterns or blocking specific ports and protocols.

A VPN solves this problem by encrypting your traffic and routing it through an external server, which makes your Among Us connection look like standard encrypted web traffic to the network administrator. The network can't identify what you're actually doing, so it can't selectively block just the game. However, we need to be direct about the ethical considerations here. If your school or employer has blocked gaming, they likely don't want you playing during class or work hours. Using a VPN to bypass these restrictions is technically possible, but it could potentially violate your institution's acceptable use policies and result in consequences. Consider the risks before deciding to circumvent these blocks.

# Privacy During Voice Chat

Among Us introduced voice chat to enhance the social deduction experience, allowing players to argue, accuse, and defend themselves in real time during emergency meetings. This feature dramatically improves gameplay, but it also means your voice is being transmitted to other players, some of whom might be strangers. While the game doesn't inherently expose identifying information through voice chat, the combination of your voice, your username, and your IP address creates a profile that determined individuals could potentially use to identify you across platforms or harass you outside the game.

A VPN adds a layer of anonymity by masking your location and making it significantly harder to connect your gaming identity to your real-world identity. This matters particularly for younger players or anyone who's experienced online harassment. The peace of mind knowing that toxic players can't easily track you down enhances the social gaming experience without restricting your ability to communicate and collaborate with your teammates.

# Regional Server Access

Among Us players are distributed globally, with strong communities in North America, Europe, Asia, and South America. Sometimes you might want to join lobbies in different regions to play with international friends, experience different play styles and communication patterns, or find active games during off-peak hours in your timezone. Regional matchmaking can sometimes restrict your options based on your detected location.

A VPN lets you connect to servers in different countries, effectively changing your virtual location and giving you access to regional lobbies that might otherwise be unavailable or difficult to access. This expands your matchmaking options significantly and helps ensure you can always find active games regardless of what time you're playing. Our testing confirmed that connecting through nearby VPN servers in your target region maintains the low latency necessary for smooth gameplay while opening up these regional options.

# Top 5 VPNs for Among Us: Detailed Reviews

# 1. NordVPN: Best Overall for Among Us

During our comprehensive testing across Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android devices, NordVPN consistently delivered the gaming performance that Among Us players need most: low latency with stable connections. The service achieved the lowest ping times we measured, averaging well below 100ms on servers within 1,000 miles of our testing locations. This level of responsiveness ensures that your actions in the game register instantly, which matters significantly during the rapid-fire accusation phases that define Among Us gameplay.

The technology behind these impressive results centers on NordLynx, NordVPN's implementation of the WireGuard protocol with additional privacy protections. Traditional VPN protocols like OpenVPN, while secure and reliable, add more computational overhead that can impact performance in real-time applications. WireGuard's modern cryptographic approach reduces this overhead significantly while maintaining robust security. NordVPN enhanced WireGuard with a double Network Address Translation system that prevents potential IP leaks without sacrificing the protocol's speed advantages.

Security features extend beyond just protocol choice. Every NordVPN server includes built-in DDoS protection, which means even if another player attempts to attack your connection, the infrastructure absorbs and mitigates the attack before it reaches you. The kill switch feature provides an additional safety layer by immediately blocking your internet connection if the VPN drops unexpectedly, ensuring your real IP address never gets exposed even during connection disruptions.

The server network's size and distribution matter more than many players realize. NordVPN operates over 6,000 servers across 61 countries, with particularly strong coverage in North America, Europe, and Asia where Among Us player populations concentrate. This extensive network ensures you can always find a nearby server for optimal performance while also providing options for accessing different regional lobbies when desired. During peak gaming hours, we never encountered overloaded servers that would degrade performance.

Pricing sits in the midrange at $2.99 per month for two-year commitments, which undercuts NordVPN's list price significantly while remaining more expensive than budget options like Surfshark. The value proposition becomes clearer when considering the combination of top-tier gaming performance, comprehensive security features, and the flexibility to use your subscription on up to ten devices simultaneously. The 30-day money-back guarantee lets you test the service risk-free to verify it meets your specific gaming needs before fully committing.

# 2. Surfshark: Best Value for Multiple Devices

Surfshark distinguishes itself immediately with a feature that no other premium VPN on our list offers: unlimited simultaneous device connections. If you play Among Us on your phone during your commute, switch to your gaming PC at home, occasionally play on your tablet, and want to protect your console gaming as well, you can do all of this with a single Surfshark subscription without juggling device limits or deciding which devices deserve protection most.

Performance testing revealed impressive results that rival more expensive competitors. On local servers, Surfshark maintained 904 Mbps download speeds with 569 Mbps upload, achieving 96% speed retention compared to our baseline unprotected connection. These numbers matter because they demonstrate that Surfshark adds minimal overhead to your connection, which translates directly to smooth Among Us gameplay without stuttering or lag spikes that could cost you the game during critical moments.

The CleanWeb feature provides an additional benefit beyond just VPN protection by blocking ads, trackers, and malicious websites at the DNS level before they reach your device. While Among Us itself doesn't serve ads if you've purchased the game or opted out of the free version's advertising, CleanWeb protects you while browsing gaming forums, watching Among Us content on video platforms, and generally navigating the internet between gaming sessions. This whole-package approach to online privacy complements the core VPN functionality effectively.

Gaming-specific features include split tunneling, which lets you route Among Us traffic through the VPN for protection while allowing other applications to connect directly for maximum speed. This proves particularly useful if you're running bandwidth-intensive downloads or streaming content simultaneously with gaming, letting you prioritize VPN protection for activities that need it while maximizing performance for everything else.

The price point makes Surfshark compelling for budget-conscious gamers. Long-term plans drop below $2.20 per month, delivering premium VPN protection for less than the cost of a single Among Us cosmetic pack. The unlimited device policy amplifies this value further, effectively letting you protect your entire household's devices for the same price competitors charge for protecting just five or ten devices. The 30-day refund policy applies to all plans, giving you a full month to test whether Surfshark meets your gaming needs.

# 3. ExpressVPN: Fastest Speeds for Competitive Play

ExpressVPN earned its reputation as the fastest VPN service through consistent performance across every metric we tested. Our speed tests averaged 399 Mbps download speeds across diverse server locations, with the service maintaining exceptional stability even on distant servers. More impressively, the speed drop-off remained minimal regardless of server distance. Connecting to a server 5,000 miles away introduced only moderate speed reduction while maintaining the low latency critical for real-time gaming.

The Lightway protocol deserves credit for much of this performance. ExpressVPN developed Lightway specifically to address the limitations of older VPN protocols, creating a lightweight protocol that establishes connections almost instantaneously, recovers gracefully from network interruptions, and consumes minimal battery power on mobile devices. For Among Us players who game on phones or tablets, this last benefit proves particularly valuable during extended sessions where battery life often becomes the limiting factor.

Security implementation matches the performance quality. ExpressVPN operates its entire network on RAM-only servers through its TrustedServer technology, which means no data ever gets written to hard drives where it could potentially be recovered later. Every time a server reboots, it wipes completely clean and loads a fresh copy of the server image. This architecture makes it technically impossible for ExpressVPN to maintain logs of your activity, even if compelled by legal requests, because the data simply doesn't exist in any persistent form.

The service has undergone more than ten independent security audits from respected firms, with results published publicly on ExpressVPN's website. These audits verify not just the company's no-logs claims but also the security of its apps, server infrastructure, and privacy policies. For players concerned about trusting a VPN provider with their internet traffic, this level of transparency and third-party verification provides meaningful assurance that the service operates as advertised.

The primary drawback remains the premium pricing. ExpressVPN costs significantly more than competitors, with plans starting around $6.67 per month for annual subscriptions. The service limits connections to eight simultaneous devices, which exceeds the industry standard of five but falls short of Surfshark's unlimited policy. Whether the price premium proves worthwhile depends on how much you value having the absolute fastest VPN speeds and whether ExpressVPN's particular combination of features aligns with your specific needs. The 30-day money-back guarantee provides a risk-free testing period to make that determination.

# 4. CyberGhost: Best for Beginners

CyberGhost approaches VPN design with a focus on accessibility that makes it ideal for players new to VPN technology who might feel intimidated by the technical complexity often associated with privacy tools. The apps across Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android present information clearly without oversimplifying to the point of removing useful functionality. Feature descriptions actually explain what each option does and why you might want to use it, which stands in stark contrast to competitors that assume you already understand VPN terminology and concepts.

The interface organizes connection options logically. Rather than just presenting a list of server locations, CyberGhost categorizes servers by use case, including dedicated gaming servers optimized for low latency connections. These gaming servers undergo additional optimization to ensure the routing paths between you and the VPN server, and between the VPN server and game servers, minimize hops and reduce latency. While any CyberGhost server works perfectly fine for Among Us, the gaming-optimized options provide an easy starting point for players unsure which server to choose.

Performance testing showed solid results that comfortably exceed Among Us's modest bandwidth requirements. We measured download speeds consistently above 300 Mbps on nearby servers, with latency adding only 8-10ms on average compared to direct connections. Among Us gameplay remained smooth and responsive throughout our testing sessions, with voice chat maintaining clear audio quality without dropouts or degradation. The service handled extended gaming sessions without connection drops or performance degradation over time.

Security features cover all the essentials: 256-bit AES encryption, automatic kill switch protection, DNS leak protection, and a verified no-logs policy that's undergone independent auditing by Deloitte. The Romanian jurisdiction places CyberGhost outside the Five Eyes, Nine Eyes, and Fourteen Eyes intelligence-sharing alliances, which provides additional privacy assurance for users concerned about government surveillance and data requests.

The pricing structure offers genuine value at $2.11 per month for two-year commitments, and CyberGhost extends an industry-leading 45-day money-back guarantee that provides extra time for thorough testing. The service allows seven simultaneous connections, which accommodates most households' device counts while stopping short of unlimited connections. For beginners who want robust protection without complexity, CyberGhost delivers a well-balanced package.

# 5. Private Internet Access: Advanced Features for Power Users

Private Internet Access (PIA) targets more technically sophisticated users who want granular control over their VPN configuration and don't mind navigating more complex settings menus to achieve optimal performance. The service provides extensive customization options that let you fine-tune everything from encryption strength to connection protocols to DNS settings, giving you the flexibility to optimize for either maximum security or maximum performance based on your priorities.

The advanced features include MACE, PIA's advertising and malware blocking system that operates at the DNS level to prevent ads and trackers from loading in the first place. Split tunneling support lets you route specific applications through the VPN while allowing others to connect directly, which proves useful for complex gaming setups where you might want Among Us protected while other applications bypass the VPN for maximum speed. Port forwarding support, while not necessary for Among Us specifically, opens possibilities for hosting game sessions or running other peer-to-peer applications securely.

Network size impresses with servers spread across 74 countries, providing global coverage that exceeds most competitors. This extensive geographic distribution helps ensure you can find nearby servers regardless of where you're located, which directly impacts the latency and performance you'll experience while gaming. During testing, we consistently achieved ping times below 100ms on servers within reasonable geographic proximity, with Among Us gameplay feeling responsive and immediate even with the VPN active.

Security configuration defaults to strong settings while allowing you to adjust encryption levels if you understand the trade-offs involved. The kill switch protection works reliably, immediately blocking internet access if your VPN connection drops unexpectedly to prevent IP leaks. PIA maintains a verified no-logs policy and operates under US jurisdiction, which some users prefer for its strong legal protections while others view skeptically due to US intelligence agencies' capabilities. The company's track record includes actual court cases where authorities demanded user data and PIA demonstrated it maintained no logs to provide.

Pricing sits in the budget-friendly range at approximately $2.03 per month for three-year subscriptions, though month-to-month pricing runs significantly higher. The service allows ten simultaneous connections, matching NordVPN's device limit while exceeding the industry standard of five. For players comfortable with technical configuration who want maximum flexibility and control over their VPN settings, Private Internet Access delivers powerful functionality at reasonable prices.

# How to Set Up a VPN for Among Us

Getting started with a VPN for Among Us requires just a few straightforward steps, regardless of which provider you choose or what platform you're gaming on.

Begin by subscribing to your chosen VPN service through their website. Most providers offer significantly better pricing on longer-term plans, so consider committing to at least a one-year subscription if the service offers a money-back guarantee that lets you test it first. Complete the payment process and create your account, making note of your login credentials.

Download the appropriate VPN app for your device from the provider's website or your device's official app store. All reputable VPN providers offer dedicated apps for Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android, while some also support Linux, Fire TV, and other platforms. Installing the app follows the same process as any other application: accept the permissions it requests, which typically include network access rights necessary for the VPN to function.

Launch the VPN app and log in using the credentials you created during signup. Most services will present you with a dashboard showing your connection status and available server locations. Before connecting to a server, explore the settings menu to enable important features: activate the kill switch protection, enable DNS leak protection if it's not enabled by default, and consider enabling your provider's ad-blocking feature if available. These one-time configuration steps ensure you're fully protected whenever the VPN connects.

Choose a server location based on your priorities. For the best Among Us performance, select a server geographically close to your physical location, ideally within the same country or region. Closer servers introduce less latency, which keeps your gameplay responsive and smooth. If you're trying to access a specific regional server or play with friends in another country, connect to a VPN server in that target region instead. Some providers offer gaming-optimized servers specifically designed for low latency, which can be an excellent choice if you're unsure which server to pick.

Click the connect button and wait for the VPN to establish its encrypted tunnel. Most modern VPNs connect within seconds using fast protocols like WireGuard or NordLynx. Once connected, launch Among Us and start playing as you normally would. The game will see the VPN server's IP address instead of your real IP, providing the protection and access benefits we discussed earlier.

If you experience lag or connection issues, try connecting to a different server. Geographic proximity matters significantly for latency, so testing servers in different locations within the same region can help you find the optimal connection. Some VPN providers offer quick connect features that automatically select the best server based on your location and current network conditions, which removes the guesswork from server selection.

# Will Among Us Ban You for Using a VPN?

This question understandably concerns players considering a VPN, as getting banned from a game you enjoy would defeat the purpose of protecting yourself in the first place.

The definitive answer: Among Us does not prohibit VPN use in its Terms of Service or Code of Conduct. We reviewed the official policy documents published by Innersloth, and VPN usage is never mentioned as a violation. The Code of Conduct focuses on actual behavioral violations like harassment, cheating, hacking, and disruptive conduct. Using a VPN to protect your connection privacy while playing the game normally doesn't fall into any of these prohibited categories.

Among Us implements account bans for legitimate violations: using hacks or cheats to gain unfair advantages, harassing or threatening other players, engaging in racist or discriminatory behavior, or attempting to evade previous bans. These bans target behavior that harms other players or violates the game's integrity. Simply connecting through a VPN to protect your IP address from other players doesn't harm anyone and doesn't provide any gameplay advantage, so it doesn't trigger the behaviors that result in bans.

The peer-to-peer nature of Among Us actually makes VPN detection significantly more challenging than it would be for games using centralized authentication servers. There's no evidence that Innersloth actively attempts to detect or block VPN users, and we found no credible reports of players being banned solely for VPN use during our research. The game functions normally with a VPN active, with no error messages or connection restrictions.

However, context matters for a complete understanding. If you use a VPN while simultaneously engaging in actual violations like cheating or harassment, you'll face consequences for those violations regardless of the VPN. The VPN doesn't provide immunity from enforcement, it simply protects your privacy. Additionally, if you're using a VPN to circumvent a previous ban on your account, that ban evasion itself constitutes a violation that could result in further consequences.

The broader gaming industry shows mixed approaches to VPN usage. Some competitive games and digital distribution platforms actively discourage VPNs to prevent players from exploiting regional pricing differences or accessing content before its official release in their region. Among Us doesn't have regional pricing variations or staggered release schedules that would create this concern, which removes the primary motivation game companies have for restricting VPN use.

Practically speaking, millions of players use VPNs for legitimate privacy and security reasons across all types of online games without issues. As long as you're using the VPN to protect yourself while playing fairly, you have no realistic risk of facing consequences from Among Us or Innersloth.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Will a VPN make Among Us lag more?**

A quality VPN adds minimal latency when connected to nearby servers. Our testing showed ping increases of just 5-10 milliseconds on average with premium providers, which remains imperceptible during gameplay. The key is choosing a server geographically close to your location and using a VPN provider with fast protocols like WireGuard or NordLynx. Poor quality VPNs or very distant servers can introduce noticeable lag, which is why we specifically tested and recommended services proven to maintain low latency for gaming.

**Can I use a free VPN for Among Us?**

We strongly recommend against using free VPNs for gaming or any activity where security matters. Free VPN providers need to generate revenue somehow, and many do so by selling your browsing data to advertisers, injecting ads into your traffic, or worse. Free VPNs typically impose severe speed and data restrictions that make gaming frustrating, operate congested servers that introduce significant lag, and rarely include the DDoS protection you need for Among Us. The security risks combined with poor performance make free VPNs a false economy that costs more in the long run.

**Does Among Us work with a VPN on mobile?**

Yes, Among Us functions perfectly well with VPN apps on both iOS and Android devices. All the VPN services we recommended offer mobile apps with the same protection as their desktop versions. Mobile VPNs prove particularly valuable for protecting yourself when playing Among Us on public WiFi networks at coffee shops, airports, or schools, where your traffic would otherwise be visible to anyone else on the network.

**Can I play Among Us at school with a VPN?**

Technically, a VPN can bypass network restrictions that block Among Us at schools or workplaces by encrypting your traffic and making it indistinguishable from regular web browsing. However, we need to emphasize the ethical and practical considerations. Your school likely blocked gaming for legitimate reasons related to maintaining an educational environment and managing network bandwidth. Using a VPN to circumvent these restrictions could violate your institution's acceptable use policy and result in disciplinary consequences if discovered. Consider whether the risk justifies bypassing rules that exist for valid reasons.

**Which VPN protocol is best for Among Us?**

WireGuard and its implementations (like NordVPN's NordLynx) provide the best combination of security and performance for gaming. WireGuard uses modern cryptography to achieve strong security with significantly less computational overhead than older protocols like OpenVPN, which translates directly to lower latency and better battery life on mobile devices. Most modern VPN providers now support WireGuard, and we recommend enabling it in your VPN settings if given a choice between protocols.

# Final Thoughts

Among Us continues thriving in 2025 because it delivers engaging social gameplay that brings people together for moments of cooperation, accusation, and occasional betrayal. Protecting yourself while enjoying these social interactions shouldn't feel complicated or expensive. A quality VPN provides essential protection from malicious players, enables access to the game from restricted networks, and adds privacy to voice chat sessions, all while maintaining the smooth, responsive gameplay that makes Among Us enjoyable in the first place.

The VPN services we've tested and recommended here represent proven solutions that balance security, performance, and value effectively.

I’m planning a surprise 2-night trip to Vienna this coming February for my girlfriend, and I’d love some help from locals or seasoned travelers.

She’s absolutely in love with history and beautiful old architecture, the kind of person who lights up at the sight of cathedrals, cobblestone streets, palaces, old libraries, and anything that feels like it's been around for centuries. I’m trying to create a weekend that really immerses her in that historical charm Vienna is known for.

I’m currently looking for accommodation recommendations, Ideally something that feels cozy, has character, and gives us a good ""base"" for exploring the historical side of Vienna. My budget is around €150 per night (for both of us), but I’d be open to spending a little more if the place really fits the vibe.

We’re not necessarily looking for anything ultra-modern or luxurious, just something with soul. A small boutique hotel, a restored townhouse, or even a really lovely guesthouse would be ideal. It doesn’t need to be in a specific district. I’m open to all suggestions! The most important thing is that it’s somewhat central or well-connected, and makes it easy for us to explore the city on foot or via public transport.

On top of that, my girlfriend is a big café enthusiast and a huge foodie. She loves discovering small, cozy spots, whether that’s a classic Viennese coffee house, a bakery with flaky pastries, or a traditional restaurant with authentic dishes. So if you know areas or places to stay that are particularly great for this kind of thing, I’m all ears.

This is her first time in Vienna, and I really want to make it memorable. If you’ve stayed somewhere magical or know of any hidden gems, even outside the tourist zones, I’d deeply appreciate the suggestions.

Thanks so much in advance! Looking forward to hearing what places you’d recommend and maybe even some tips for must-see spots or restaurants too.",1,1762857061.0,travel,0,1.0,False
1ou6219,https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/1ou6219/am_i_reading_too_much_into_this_entp/,Am I reading too much into this ENTP?,"ENTP coworker asks me out for coffee. 
We meet, we chat for 2 hours, he’s very sweet. He sets up the table, gives me napkins and stuff while he’s taking his own napkin. He says that the meal is on him, and he makes things pretty comfortable for me the whole time. Gives me compliments, doesn’t look at his phone while we’re together, not even once. He tells me that we should do this often, maybe next week same time.

We were walking outside and it was a little chilly and he kept asking me whether I was cold and if it was we could go back indoors.

He was just an overall such a pleasant, considerate guy. 

Then again, he’s an ENTP guy so I’m wondering whether he’s just really good at catering to people and good at things socially because he’s an extrovert?

Oh yeah! He kept trying to give me tips and ways to work smarter , and he thought I was working too hard. That was also so nice of him. It’s like he really wanted to save me lol (I’m an INFJ and I over exert myself in my work a little too much).

So… is this interest or he’s just being nice to a coworker?? lol. I hope I don’t appear like an idiot who’s being clueless about something that’s obvious.
