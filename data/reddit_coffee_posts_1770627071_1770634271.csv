1r013ez,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenAscending/comments/1r013ez/how_to_hack_your_hormones_and_actually_lose/,How to Hack Your Hormones and Actually Lose Weight: The REAL Science Behind It,"So I've been diving deep into hormone research for months now. books, podcasts, scientific papers, the whole deal. And honestly? Most advice about weight loss is trash. We're told to ""just eat less and move more"" like our bodies are simple calculators. They're not.

Here's what blew my mind: your hormones are literally running the show. And most of us are walking around with completely dysregulated hormone systems without even knowing it. No wonder we can't lose weight. No wonder we're exhausted. The system is rigged against us, our modern lifestyle is actively fighting our biology. But here's the good news, once you understand how this works, you can actually do something about it.

I'm sharing what actually worked based on legit science, not instagram BS.

The cortisol trap nobody talks about

Most people don't realize they're stuck in chronic stress mode. Your cortisol stays elevated all day from work stress, lack of sleep, too much coffee, doom scrolling. When cortisol is high, your body literally cannot burn fat properly. It holds onto every calorie like you're about to face a famine.

Dr. Robert Lustig's research at UCSF shows how cortisol directly blocks your fat burning hormones. His work on metabolic syndrome is insane. The book [""Metabolic: The Luring and Hype of Processed Food, Nutrition, and Modern Medicine""](https://www.amazon.com/Metabolical-Processed-Nutrition-Modern-Medicine/dp/0063027712) breaks down exactly how our modern environment sabotages our hormones. This won won multiple awards and Lustig is one of the leading endocrinologists in the world. Reading this made me realize how little control we actually have when our hormones are messed up. Best metabolism book I've ever read, hands down.

Quick cortisol hacks that actually work:  
Do nothing for 10 mins daily. Seriously. No phone, no stimulation. Your nervous system needs to downregulate.  
Stop drinking coffee after 12pm. It keeps cortisol elevated way longer than you think.  
Get sunlight within 30 mins of waking. This sets your cortisol rhythm properly for the entire day.

The insulin resistance spiral

Most people are insulin resistant and don't know it. When you eat carbs constantly throughout the day, your insulin stays elevated. High insulin = fat storage mode permanently turned on. You literally cannot access your fat stores when insulin is high.

Dr. Jason Fung's work on this is incredible. [""The Obesity Code: Unlocking the Secrets of Weight Loss""](https://www.amazon.com/Obesity-Code-Unlocking-Secrets-Weight/dp/1771641258) explains why calorie counting doesn't work when your hormones are broken. This book has sold over a million copies and Fung is a nephrologist who's treated thousands of patients. The insulin explanation finally made everything click for me. This book will make you question everything you think you know about dieting.

What actually helps:  
Time restricted eating. Stop eating 3 hours before bed, don't eat for 12-14 hours overnight. This gives insulin a chance to drop.  
Eat protein and fat first at meals. Slows down the insulin spike dramatically.  
Walk after meals. Even 10 mins. Muscles soak up glucose without needing as much insulin.

The app Zero is great for tracking your eating window. It's simple, shows you exactly when to stop eating, helps you build the habit without overthinking it.

The sleep hormone connection everyone ignores

Poor sleep destroys leptin (your satiety hormone) and increases ghrelin (your hunger hormone). One night of bad sleep can make you 30% more hungry the next day. Your willpower isn't the problem, your biology is.

Matthew Walker's ""Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams"" is genuinely life changing. Walker is a UC Berkeley neuroscience professor and this became an instant bestseller for a reason. The section on how sleep affects weight and hormones is terrifying. Best sleep book out there, period. After reading this I completely changed how I think about sleep.

Sleep protocol that works:  
Keep your room cold. Like 65-68°F cold. Your body temp needs to drop to sleep deeply.  
No screens 1 hour before bed. The blue light destroys melatonin production even with blue light filters.  
Magnesium glycinate before bed. Game changer for sleep quality. 200-400mg.

The app Insight Timer has great sleep meditations and yoga nidra sessions that actually help you fall asleep. I use it almost every night now. Way better than just laying there with racing thoughts.

For anyone wanting to go deeper without spending hours reading all these books, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is an AI-powered learning app that pulls from high-quality sources like the books mentioned above, plus research papers and expert interviews on metabolism and hormones. You type in a goal like ""fix my hormones to lose weight naturally"" and it generates personalized audio learning and an adaptive plan based on your unique situation.

You can customize the depth, from a quick 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with examples and research details. The voice options are surprisingly addictive too, there's even a smoky, calming voice that's perfect for learning before bed. Built by Columbia grads and Google AI experts, so the content is fact-checked and science-based. It connects all these hormone insights into one structured plan instead of jumping between books and podcasts randomly.

Thyroid dysfunction is way more common than you think

Your thyroid controls your metabolic rate. If it's sluggish, you're fighting an uphill battle. Most doctors only test TSH which misses so many thyroid issues. You need full thyroid panel including T3, T4, reverse T3, antibodies.

Research shows that chronic dieting and stress tank your thyroid function. Your body thinks you're starving and slows everything down to conserve energy.

Things that support thyroid:  
Adequate protein. At least 0.8g per pound of body weight. Thyroid hormones are made from amino acids.  
Selenium and zinc. Brazil nuts and oysters or supplement if needed.  
Stop overexercising. Too much cardio tanks thyroid hormones in many people.

The strength training hormone boost

Lifting heavy things is the best hormone hack that exists. It increases testosterone and growth hormone naturally in both men and women. These are your fat burning, muscle building hormones.

Cardio can actually increase cortisol if you do too much. But resistance training has the opposite effect, it improves insulin sensitivity and helps regulate cortisol.

You don't need to spend hours in the gym. 3x per week, 30-45 mins, focusing on compound movements. That's it.

The reality is our modern environment is working against our biology constantly. Artificial light, processed food, chronic stress, lack of movement. It's not just about willpower. Once I understood the hormone piece, everything else fell into place. You're not broken, your hormones just need support.",1,1770634109.0,MenAscending,0,1.0,False

1r012ey,https://i.redd.it/9jy11s4o7gig1.png,Batao guys what & how to do? (Obviously Relationship Advice),"This is my first post on Reddit. I was just scrolling randomly and found this community interesting, so I thought yeah… this might be a good place to get some clarity.

I’m 20M, currently in my final year of graduation, studying in what I’d honestly call a *tier-5 college* 💀  
Like, super small campus, 8 rooms each on 3 floors, 4 courses. It literally feels like school. We have uniforms, and if you don’t attend lectures, you get scolded. Full trauma.

So, pata hai aaj kya hua, I help in my family business (a store), and every evening there used to be this girl who passed in front of the shop. She used to ride her Activa, dropping her younger brother for tuition, I guess. I’d see her almost daily, and in my head I was like *bhai please koi toh connection ho,* same school, same college, kuch bhi, so that I could maybe talk to her someday.

And then… plot twist happened.  
About 6 months later, during my sem 5 pre-tests, I saw her sitting **in my class itself**, writing a test but for **sem 1**, same course as mine. I was SHOOK. Matlab legit *what are the odds?*

From that day on, I (not proudly) started collecting info about her. I got to know her name, her IG, where she lives (which is literally near my house 😊), etc etc. In between all this, I was busy with competitive exams and stuff, so I kept postponing the idea of proposing or talking to her.

But now that I’m regular in sem 6, the urge to confess is hitting hard. She seems really innocent and so am I, honestly 😭  
I’ve barely talked to girls unless kaam ho. Otherwise I’m like *mujhe kya lena dena*. In college, I’m known as that quiet, serious, suspense-type guy who just sits in the library for hours, reading books. I also do a part-time job, so I genuinely don’t have time to waste or hang around much.

Right now, I’m completely confused about **how to approach her**.  
How do I even start a conversation?  
What do I say in the first meet?  
How do I ask her out for coffee… in the *first go*?

Also I got a chance to show myself off to her in a pro way, on our college's placement day, where some local companies come to offer some mediocre jobs. I had one and a family business too, but i had a very strong CV. The college assigns students of 1st year to sit outside the classes as interview rooms, and to send a student as turn goes, so when i reached clg, for giving my interview outside the company where her duty was to sit, so that i can show her my qfs, and just get a way to talk to her.   
And she got ABSENT on that day...😢😢

I keep postponing everything, thinking about “best chances of acceptance” and overthinking like crazy. Also, a friend told me she sometimes comes to college by car (she’s 18), though she lives barely 1 km away same area as me. I usually come on my bike, she’s mostly on her Activa.

So yeah… I’m puzzled af.

Reddit bhaiyo, please help.  
How do I talk to her without making it awkward or creepy?  
What’s a normal, non-cringe first line?  
And is asking for coffee directly a bad idea?

Like I said we used to be super fond of each other and comfortable with each other like switching sweaters for shits n giggles, laying down on each others shoulders or laps, speaking without speaking ykwim. But then we had a field trip where five of is decided to play the pocky game, two of those five being me and her, the game was to bite the pocky from someone else’s mouth as small and possible so basically lips super close and the pair with the tiniest pocky would win. Me and her won we got is soo tiny. I played around 15 rounds, 3 with someone leaning into me and 12 with me leaning in, in the round where me and her got the record I was leaning in and for some reason she was super nervous, she was nervous with everyone but she was like super duper nervous to do it with me to the point where I was over her (bus chairs) and holding her jaw and the back of her neck with both my hands to keep her still, we played a total of 4-5 times together and she only leaned into me once and all those rounds she was super extra nervous. TWO WHOLE WEEKS LATER the game was brought up while me and my friends were talking and she just casually mentions “myname is a good kisser” then she quickly put her hands on my jaw and neck the way i did on the bus.

After that things got weirder between us, like we were less sweet and comfortable, still comfortable but there was obviously smth weird happening. Like she frowns at me more than she smiles at me now when it used to be the complete opposite, it feels so angsty. But when we’re alone things feel romantic and angsty like shes doesnt share food or drinks cuz shes saliva conscious but we shared a kinder egg using the same spoon and passing it between each other, she asked for a sip of my coffee (she doesnt like coffee). And during my birthday party we went swimming and I piggy backed on her back for half the time like my arms wrapped around her shoulders and my chin occasionally resting on her shoulder or head. During my birthday party we even ate alone together while all our friends were eating elsewhere together, she’d get me drinks, i’d get her food. She had to leave early so she also had to get dressed early so despite the cold (it was night swimming) id get out of the pool wvery 3-5 minutes to check on her and talk to her (she refused to pull up a chair and sit beside the pool cuz she didnt wanna get wet again) and I even convinced her to try out the tire swing. When I asked for someone to tie my bikini she immediately volunteers, when I asked for someone to take photos of me she put 110% effort into the photos i mean like squatting turning the phone upside down type shit and she took them by the pool fully dressed even after she claimed she didnt want to get wet again (she got splashed). And earlier that day the two of us disappeared and left our friends upstairs while the two of us stayed downstairs for a whole 20 minutes, she was playing with my pets while we talked.

I think my friends are starting to notice because their first guess when they try to guess my crush is ALWAYS her and i have to deny it unfortunately (only one of my friends knows). And they say its because shes EXACTLY my type and she really is shes literally perfect in my eyes. My friend took a photo of us from behind sharing an umbrella in the rain shoulder to shoulder since it was a smell umbrella and when i asked her why she took that photo she said “you guys look like a cute old couple like mama and papa”.

Strong gusts of wind rage against my childhood home with a whistling, almost howling sound. I’m standing in my younger brother’s cot, grasping its cold metal bars, wailing “Mu-um!” again and again in a desperate bid to get her attention. To the initiated, it sounds like a toddler singing *The Great Gig in the Sky* after stubbing their toe on a coffee table; to anyone else, it just sounds annoying. Behind me, my younger brother, Thomas, sits cross-legged, arms stiff and fists clenched. From underneath his bowl cut, he belts out his own version of the song. Once our ‘muse’ arrives, I cry out, “Mum! Ghosts!” She laughs, clearly amused by our terror, and with her trademark sing-song rhythm, says, “Silly Billy! That just wind!” I’m not convinced; to me, ghosts inhabit the wind and loom in the dark.

A couple of years later, I’m sitting centimetres away from our boxy grey TV, watching myself on screen for the first time. Dad has just tested his new VHS camcorder, a grey brick to match our TV. On screen, my two brothers and I jump on the trampoline in our backyard. He tells us to smile, and we all reply with a drawn-out “cheese,” one after another, almost in canon, before my parents’ laughter breaks out in the background. It’s the first time I see myself as something that can be watched, and I am captivated.

But as I move from the living room into the classroom, the audience changes. On my first day of school, I lay eyes on a girl named Dixie, a tall blonde with hazel-green eyes. Her ponytail is secured with a black hair tie featuring two smiley-face accents, fluorescent pink and lime green versions of the familiar yellow icon. Though they clash horribly with our light and dark blue school uniform, I admire her hair ties and the contrast between her lowlights and highlights. I wish my hair had that many colours, and I long to be her friend. At lunchtime, I introduce myself, but she isn’t interested. The sting is immediate. I begin to wonder why she doesn’t want me to be part of her world.

Rejection becomes a theme at school, where I'm bullied early and often. I’m not sure what the catalyst is, but the taunts always focus on how I’m different. Being part-Asian makes me a “nipper,” while others say, “go back to your own country,” even though I was born here. Meanwhile, being skinny earns me the name “stick,” while my small, high-pitched voice is mocked as “whiny.” Enduring such rhetoric is a death by a thousand cuts, the name-calling so frequent that the insults begin to blur into a whirl of faces and voices that replay on a loop. At one point, the taunts follow me into a void of complete darkness where my classmates’ heads circle me in a grotesque ring-around-the-rosie. Caught in their orbit with nowhere to hide, I wake up in a foetal position and remain there, eyes open, until morning.

In grade two, Regina, a pretty blonde with a light dusting of golden freckles, mocks me for changing outside the changeroom’s toilet stalls. It never occurs to me that my body could be a source of shame, but since she thinks it is, it must be.

Two years later, the class discusses how gross see-through swimmers are while our teacher writes on the blackboard. The conversation feels typical until my crush, Luke, begins listing all the kids who wear them. He announces that I am one of them. I don’t believe him and insist he’s wrong. But as the other children agree with his observation, my defensiveness gives way to humiliation and heartbreak. I have nothing more to say. Everyone has seen what I’ve spent two years trying to hide.

If school is a whirl of heads and slurs, church is a sanctuary of stillness. The bullying at school is relentless, but in the pews, I find reprieve. On weeks when I don’t have Sunday School, I sit with my family, usually on the right-hand side, about three-quarters of the way back. There, I mostly daydream, admittedly more focused on the beauty of the architecture than the beauty of our Saviour. While I lack the attention span to absorb sermons in their entirety, some moments stay with me. Once, a toddler breaks free from her parents’ arms and dashes across the altar. The congregation laughs warmly at the commotion as her mother, red-faced, tries to catch her. Pastor Dell, or Mama Dell as we call her, smiles and says this is how we should come to God: boldly, like little children. I do so from that moment on.

After the service, while the adults gather outside for morning tea, I return indoors and walk the internal perimeter, tracing the walls with my eyes as I greet each painting one by one. The paintings seem inspired by the Baroque era, and although each image is fascinating in its own right, one image stands apart. In it, a lacerated Jesus hunches under the weight of His cross, which he drags through the dirt while a crowd looks on. I wonder why they painted Him in such a cruel light. With no one nearby to answer me, I begin to wonder, *Where’s Dad?*

On a different Sunday, I attend Sunday School and learn about the Ten Commandments. After returning home from class, I perch halfway down the steps leading from our back veranda. On my left are the familiar beige bricks of our home; on my right, two thin metal handrails coated in peeling white paint. In theory, the rails should catch me if I fall, but I’m so scrawny it’s more likely I’d slip through. I think about how all the fairytale princesses I know are perfect, and how I desperately long to be perfect too. I slowly recite each commandment in my head, carefully checking them off as sins I’ve never committed. I feel proud of my holiness until I reach the sixth: *You shall not murder.* My stomach drops. I think about the ants I squashed and the snake I ran over with my tricycle while screaming for my mum to save me, because I thought it would kill me if I didn’t kill it first. At that moment, I realise I’m not perfect. I’m not a princess. I’m a murderer.

Manze looking at it , It all starts with the small things. Not the big moves. Not the million-dollar idea. Not the viral moment or the lucky break or the right connection at the right time.

The small things.

Cleaning your room and feeling satisfied. Actually satisfied. Not because someone's coming over. Not because you're trying to impress anyone. Just because it feels right. Because when you wake up tomorrow and the floor is swept and the bed is made, your brain has one less thing to carry.

Wishing someone a good day. The shopkeeper. The boda guy. The security guard at the gate. And meaning it. Not as a transaction. Not to get something back. Just because you can. Because words are free and kindness costs nothing and sometimes that's all someone needs before the world reminds them it's heavy.

Enjoying that cup of coffee. Or tea. Or water. Whatever you can afford. Not scrolling through your phone while you drink it. Not rushing to the next thing. Just sitting there. Tasting it. Feeling the warmth. Five minutes where you're not chasing anything. Just present.

Small things, man.

And then the bigger small things. The ones that don't make sense yet.

Getting that ID so you can vote out that leader people don't want. Maybe you're not affected. Maybe your life is the same whether they're in or out. Maybe the corruption hasn't reached your pocket yet. Maybe the bad policies haven't touched your family. Maybe you're comfortable enough to think politics doesn't matter.

But someone isn't, man. Someone's struggling because of decisions made in rooms you'll never enter. Someone's mother can't afford medication because the health budget was ""redirected."" Someone's business collapsed because the right palms weren't greased. Someone's kid isn't in school because the bursary funds vanished.

And one day? That someone might be you.

So you get that ID. You register. You show up. Not because you believe in any of them. Not because you think your vote will change everything. But because while wasee wengine are complaining on Twitter, screenshoting headlines, and writing long threads about how broken the system is, you're actually doing the one thing you can do.

You're voting those responsible out.

And even if it feels like a whisper in a stadium, even if it feels pointless, at least you tried. At least you showed up. At least you didn't sit quiet while they stayed in power.

But beyond that? One day you'll need to prove you exist. You'll need to open that bank account. Register that business. Apply for that passport. Get that KRA PIN. And if you don't have the ID, you're stuck. Completely stuck.

So you get it. Not just for today. Not just for the election. But because future you will thank you.

Getting that passport. The one that costs 7,500 bob. When you're broke. When you have no ticket. No visa. No plan to fly anywhere. No means to even dream of boarding a plane. But you get it anyway. You save. You sacrifice. You skip meals if you have to. Because that passport isn't just a document, man. That's a door. And doors don't open for people who aren't ready to walk through them. So you get ready. Even when the opportunity hasn't shown up yet.

Replacing that lost ID even though it's a whole process. Going to Huduma Centre. Waiting in line. Filling forms. Paying fees. When you could just... not. When you could keep living without it. But you do it. Because the small inconvenience today saves you from the big problem tomorrow.

Getting that driving license. No car. No parking spot. Not even a boda. Just you and a learner's permit and borrowed fees for the test. People laugh. ""Unachukua DL ya nini na huna gari?"" And you just smile. Because they don't get it. The license isn't for today. It's for the day someone offers you a job that requires one. The day you need to rent a car. The day your boy says ""drive"" and hands you the keys. You can't get the opportunity if you're not ready for it.

Opening that bank account. Even when it's empty. Even when the minimum balance feels like a joke because you're putting in 500 bob just to keep it alive. Even when you don't know where the big money will come from. Not yet. Not today. Maybe not this year. But you open it. You get the card. You learn how mobile banking works. You set up M-Pesa paybill. You understand the system. Because when the money does come, when that first client pays, when that idea finally converts, you need somewhere to put it. And you can't be figuring out banking when the bag is already in your hand.

Small things, man.

People don't see this part. They see the after. The success. The car. The house. The business. The freedom. And they think it just happened. Like one day you woke up and the universe said ""here you go.""

But it doesn't work like that.

The universe doesn't give you things you're not ready for. It doesn't hand you a million shillings when you can't even manage a thousand. It doesn't give you a Range Rover when you don't even have a license. It doesn't fly you to Dubai when your passport is expired and sitting in a drawer somewhere.

It tests you first. With the small things.

Can you keep your room clean when no one's watching? Can you show up on time when there's no boss to impress? Can you save 100 bob when you could spend it? Can you be kind when you're tired? Can you prepare when you have no proof it'll pay off?

That's the test, man.

And if you pass, the universe moves. Pole pole. Slowly. But it moves.

You clean your room today. Tomorrow you clean your mind. Next week you clean your habits. Next month you clean your circle. And before you know it, your whole life is in order. Not perfect. But ready.

You get that ID. Then you get that account. Then you get that passport. Then you get that license. And when the opportunity comes, when someone says ""we need someone who can start Monday"" or ""we need someone who can travel next week"" or ""we need someone who can drive,"" you don't scramble. You don't panic. You just say ""I'm ready.""

Because you've been preparing, man. In the small things. In the invisible things. In the things nobody applauded you for.

I don't know when the big win will come. I don't know when the idea will launch or the money will flow or the life I keep dreaming about will show up.

But I know this.

When it comes, I'll be ready.

Because I've been getting ready. One small thing at a time.

The universe will provide, man. Pole pole tuh.

You just have to meet it halfway.",3,1770633517.0,nairobi,0,1.0,False

1r00t6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/braintumor/comments/1r00t6q/post_surgery_update/,Post Surgery Update,"Hey gang, I’ve posted in this group a few times and I thought I’d update everyone on my experience.

I had a benign tumour near my brain stem and on Tuesday Feb 3rd I had the operation.

I thought I’d give you more of a walk through of my experience for those of you who don’t know what to expect…..

At **6am, The day of the surgery** I checked in at the hospital, was set up with an IV in my hand and send off to get a CT Scan (it took 5 minutes) before sending me back to the pre-op area where I spoke with the anesthesiologist. Within an hour I was off to the operating room. They rolled me in, the staff of 7 or 8 were standing around me as they talked about their procedures and I cracked a few jokes about them fixing my golf swing before the anesthesia did its thing.

6 hours later I wake up in recovery room in a lot of pain and disorientation. Turns out they had to cut through some of my neck muscles which was the cause of the pain. The doctor told me prior that they would only stretch them apart a little to make room but I guess they decided not to.

I was then brought into a regular hospital room in the ICU where nurses and doctors checked my vitals every 2 hours and pumped me full of pain and nausea medication. I couldn’t sleep at all the first night, I was very uncomfortable.

**DAY 2:** 

I woke up after having what little sleep I could and was given more meds. Doctors would come in and check my coordination asking me to raise each arm, touch my nose, etc to see if there was any damage done to my brain stem.

I had some numbness on my head, left side of my face, left hand and likely other places that I didn’t notice. My coordination was a little off.

Later in the day, the nurse took out my catheter (it didn’t hurt having it in, it was just weird and uncomfortable) and she helped me sit up in bed and get some comfortable clothes on. She helped me stand up and sit in a chair upright.

A doctor had me walk the hallway a little to gauge my coordination and strength. They did this a lot. I was told that nausea would be common for a few days, so they kept up with the meds to help with that and of course the pain meds. I was sent for a post surgery MRI as well.

That night I was able to get some sleep but I was up almost every hour to pee. 

**Day 3:**

By the morning of day 3, my neck pain already started to ease up and I was able to eat a little. They were already talking about me going home  if I felt comfortable. I honestly think that getting up and walking back and forth to the washroom improved my coordination enough to make them comfortable enough to say that. 

I had no appetite at all but was forcing down a smoothie from the food court.

The surgeon came to see me, explained that the were able to remove 100% of the tumour and I could go home when I was ready, since all they were doing was managing my pain and nausea which I could just do at home. So with prescriptions in hand, my family took me home.

**Days 4-6 at home:**

By day 5 most of neck pain is gone and I’m finally able to have a bowel movement. By the way, coffee was the best help in that department. My appetite is back and I’m feeling more normal.

I was instructed not to lift more than 10lbs for a month or strain myself on the toilet because I could faint. I’m not cleared to drive yet and I’m waiting on a call for neuro-physio therapy. 

**As I type this, it’s 5:00am on Monday (day 6)** because I haven’t been able to sleep regular hours as I’ve been out of whack for almost a week. Seriously, I’m wide awake all night and tired during the day. I’ll take small naps here and there but I can’t get a full night sleep yet.

Also I still have a lot of mild numbness on my body which I’m told could go away in weeks to months.

I was pretty calm and cool leading up to the operation which isn’t like me or my wife lol. We prayed a lot and “left it to God”. Our Christian faith played a big part in how we handled this whole thing so I really encourage prayer.

So that’s it. Feel free to ask any questions, I’m happy to share.",1,1770633102.0,braintumor,1,1.0,False

I would have loved to tell u we have fucked a lot and he used me like a slut like it happens in fiction but this is, sadly, the reality. So as I told u last time I have been in a bit of a slutty phase and it happens that I have brought my fwb over to do something even if I have to be honest, while we do it sometimes I think about how would be like to do that with my neighbour. That man looks so manly and I love how he tries not to show interest, like last time I met him and his daughter, she said they had to go home for a thing because they were late but his father still stayed with me talking for a while while his daughter got home. He is not the dream daddy but he is so tall and friendly I wanna see how his eyes would look at me when I glance at him while gagging on that dick. Btw getting back to reality I have met him on the stairs more than the usual and I always try to smile at what he says and ask him more things to keep him talking to me and I don’t know if he like me in that way but he always keep talking to me for how long we can. Thanks to the people who write to me and send me advices last time while talking I even had the courage to glance at his dick and I think he noticed cause he stopped talking for a sec and then kept saying what he was about to say like nothing happened. Fuck I really wanna have my chance on him. I am scared that he would say something to my dad but I am realistically thinking about being naked the next time he will ring the bell of my door. These days I am usually home alone and the idea is to get naked if I know it is him ringing the bell and putting something to cover just dick and ass so when I open the door I can tell him I was showering. Maybe I can even let him enter and ask if he wants a cup of coffee but Idk I am a bit scared too. Help pls. Every advise will be appreciated ",0,1770632363.0,askgaybros,0,0.33,False

i’m 19 and working as a nurse in a hospital, which means my life is either calm and reflective or slightly chaotic and running on coffee.

i love journaling (i romanticize my life a little too much), listening to music for hours, anything sanrio especially when i need comfort and having conversations that actually mean something.

i’m really into deep talks, philosophy, psychology, emotions, the “why are we like this as humans?” type of stuff. small talk is fine, but i love when conversations slowly drift into something real.

i appreciate emotionally intelligent people the kind who can communicate, reflect, and aren’t afraid of vulnerability.

I dropped her a text omw to my place that it was a good time and nice meeting you. She replied with a ""Likewise:):)"". Then after a while at night I asked if she wants to catch up again sometime. The next morning she replied with ""Yus Yus anytime"". I told her this weekend could work if she's free. She told she'll let me know and got some exams coming as well.

far into the hypnosis on youtube, i was told to imagine a doorway into my past life. this door led to whom i thought was myself which was an old black woman in a light blue night gown. however, when i walked through i immediately entered behind the counter of a coffee shop and i heard the name ""fred"" repeatedly being yelped excitedly as i was hugged by a younger version of the woman i saw through my imagined doorway. 

i assume that woman is my wife and my name is fred. i was in brown leather slightly pointed boots with a lace. my clothes were also brown and i think i had just gotten back from work or somewhere fancy considering my clothes felt very professional. 

the most disturbing part of my life regression was when i was brought to the childhood of my past life in which my mother was beaten to death by a white man with some type of stick. i felt my throat feel soreness as i screamed for my mother's mercy and i felt the tears streaming down my face. i was tied up though and i was forced to watch. however there was a faint feeling of a sting on my arm when i was in this memory. i'm not sure but i think i was injured as well. 

towards the end of the meditation i was told to imagine my last memory in this life, and i was older in my bed all alone and i remember closing my eyes to fall asleep but i ""felt"" pain in my legs when i died soon after. 

i'm just wondering what i do with this information now. it feels relevant to my life but i don't know how. 

also when i hugged my wife, she felt familiar but i just don't know who that could be? 

i definitely feel like this was during the time period of segregation considering that during this past life regression i witnessed my mom getting beaten to death by a white man and when i first walked into the coffee shop, it was all black coffee shop. 

i'm also remembering my personality in this past life and i held myself to a serious yet gentle demeanor. 

this is my first reddit post and i dont really know how this works but i would be so happy to hear some other past life regression experiences and maybe some help with understanding my own experience! ",1,1770631793.0,pastlives,0,1.0,False

Replying to the same ""Where is my order?"" and ""Do you ship to X?"" DMs on Instagram and TikTok was taking up 2 hours of my day.

I didn't want to hire a VA yet (trying to keep margins high), so I optimized my stack to do it myself faster. Thought I'd share the tools I'm using in 2026:

**1. ChatGPT (The Brain)** I don't write replies anymore. I have a prompt that says ""You are a friendly support agent for \[Store Name\], answer this politely: \[Paste Message\]"". It generates the perfect response in seconds.

**2. Copied (The Speed Hack)** This is the game changer I found recently. It’s a keyboard for iOS. Basically, I saved all my best ChatGPT responses and FAQ answers into it. Now, when I’m in Instagram DMs or WhatsApp, I just switch keyboards and tap the answer. It pastes it instantly. No more switching apps to Notes, copying, switching back, and pasting. It saves me about 30 seconds per ticket.

**3. Canva (Visuals)** I keep 3 ""templates"" for support (Size Guide, Shipping Chart, Refund Policy). When someone asks, I just drop the image in the chat. Visuals close tickets faster than text.

**4. Trello (Tracking)** Simple board: ""To Do"", ""Waiting on Supplier"", ""Refunded"". Don't overcomplicate it with expensive CRMs if you're doing under $10k/mo.

**The Result:** I clear my inbox in about 15 minutes every morning over coffee.

1r008l3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MussoorieAndLandour/comments/1r008l3/2_day_itinerary_solocouple_from_delhi/,2 day itinerary | Solo/Couple | From Delhi,"Hello travellers,

We recently visited Mussoorie and Landour from 29 January to 1 February 2026 and here's the itinerary we followed:-

29 January 2026:

Started from Delhi with Laxmi Holidays Bus and reached Dehradun by 6 AM, and then were transferred to a cab which took another 1 hour.

Experience: Bus was okayish, last leg was very very bad, we were forced into the cab in numbers (bolero). Laxmi Holidays not recommended.

30 January 2026:

Reached early morning at library chowk (majorly all drop offs happen here). There is a view point so take in some moment to enjoy sunrise and clean air.

Scooter rental people were already there, so took our scooter and went to hotel for early check-in.

Booked Hotel Super (Perfect Stayz) because it had like 4.7/5 rating for 2,200/night. You can get better deals if you search around. Checked-in early and had a nap. Had breakfast. The location of hotel is perfect.

Thought of visiting Clouds end but commercial scooter are not allowed on Mall Road, so took a detour to George Everest.

George Everest:

Park scooter near Everest Base ticket entry and pay 200/person for ticket.

There is a steep climb for 900 meters with patchy and dangerous trek.

Note: Please remove jackets, thermals, and trek only in tshirt otherwise you will be cooked.

Views from the top are breathtaking. Highly recommended.

Returned to mussoorie around \~4 PM, went to Llama Cafe, just near our hotel and had lunch. Delicious food and drinks. Recommended.

Had dinner at hotel and called the day off early.

31 January 2026:

Started early to Dhanaulti Surkanda Devi Mandir, 1-1.5 hour drive. Park the scooter on the road and purchase Prashad from shop (if you want).

Used the ropeway because hike was tooo much.

Reached by \~12 PM. The views again are breathtaking. Highly recommended.

Then took turn to Landour. Park scooter near Church and then walk to Landour Bakehouse and Sister's Cafe.

Landour Bakehouse:

Wait time was too much, ordering takeout is more like adventure because there are a lot of monkeys always ready to snatch the order.

So either wait for your turn or order a takeaway and put it in your bag and hope for the best.

Both Cold coffee and cookies were mid, had better coffee at Llama Cafe.

Views are really great. Avoid Lal Tibba, you get better view everywhere, no sense in paying for a 'better view'.

Note on Landour: Roads are very steep and if you have experience with scooter only then should you take it up.

Returned to Mussoorie around 6-7 PM, went for a stroll on Mall Road, did some shopping and ate dinner at hotel.

Had our bus in the morning so left early.

Notes:

1. Mussoorie is very beautiful, you'll see views everywhere so don't make your trip a checklist of places. Keep places less and eyes open wide.
2. Take up a scooter. Helps navigate traffic and provides flexibility.
3. Weather is nice, not too cold not too hot, carry thermal and a down jacket with scarf. You'll be fine.
4. Walk. Walk. Walk.
5. Keep water always handy, you'll be dehydrated with the walking.
6. Keep plan flexible.

Feel free to ask questions if you have any.",2,1770631004.0,MussoorieAndLandour,2,1.0,False

casio g-shock transparent
Wore this to a rooftop hang and got asked if it fell out of Blade Runner. Gears visible through the case—nerd flex unlocked. Time drifts 15 seconds fast weekly… but honestly? I check my phone anyway. Vibe > accuracy.

nike everyday ankle socks
$ 15? Hard pass. Shrank after wash, swoosh peeled off, hole before first wear. Felt like damp tissue. My feet filed for divorce. Uniqlo socks cost less and actually last.

fog essentials hoodie
Pulled it on straight from the bag, walked to grab bodega coffee. Fabric’s stupid soft, no tag itch, tiny ""ESSENTIALS"" text barely whispers on the chest. Washed twice—zero pilling, zero fading. The quiet flex that actually works. Already my go-to.

carhartt workwear zip-up
Smells like sawdust and confidence. Heavy canvas, zipper fights back at first (respect). Light rain? Beaded right off. Pockets deep enough for keys, phone, and my existential dread. Not ""fashion."" Just works.

amiri black hoodie
Silver ""AMIRI"" embroidery on the back catches dim bar light like a secret signal. Hood’s oversized, fabric thick enough for fall nights. Drawstrings too long—keep dipping in my latte. Still, wore it once and got ""you in a band?"" vibes. Worth the coffee stains.

carsicko grey hoodie
Tiny red heart patch on chest, hand-stitched energy. No logo screaming for attention. Wore it with black jeans, got zero compliments—and that’s why I love it. For me, not the algorithm.

carsicko grey pants
Same heart patch, same red drawcord. Cuffs so tight I had to roll them twice. Look fire in the mirror… walk like a confused penguin. One-and-done for photos only.

amiri bone jeans
Bones crawling down the legs, fake tear at the knee. Wore these to a show—stranger yelled ""cool pants!"" from across the room. Heavy denim, but broke in fast. Loud? Absolutely. Regret? Zero.

lv trainer
Monogram crisp, ""VUITTON"" strap legit. Sole harder than my will to adult. Two hours in = feet screaming for mercy. Now living on my shelf like modern art. Flex tax paid. No shame.

jordan 5 black metallic
Metallic wings shine like I just won the lottery. Translucent sole? Shows every speck of NYC dirt instantly. Air unit squeaks with every step—annoying, but weirdly satisfying. Got stopped three times walking home. Worth the wipe-down ritual.

I don’t know why I’m writing this really. I guess it’s to stop me messaging him or doing something silly 

Me and my partner were together 5 years. I was working 2 jobs studying for masters and managing my house where my partner didn’t help all that much and worked one part time job. 

I got very little sympathy or empathy and it slowly wore me down to my core. I burnt out. 

I came home after my shift (I’m a nurse) to his bags packed and he left me. No explanation. Just went. He was staying with our best friend and now he’s looking for his own place. 

I’ve sent the messages at the beginning begging to come home and everything was met with either rude replies or silence. I’ve never lied or cheated. 

Since then I was admitted for emergency surgery to have my gallbladder out which explained the pain I got all year that made me so grumpy that he didn’t believe. 

Since he left he’s been keeping himself very busy with holidays abroad which is what I expected. I’m writing this after dropping my dog off at her groomers and crying in the coffee shop

I’ve cried every day for 3 months and have been under the intensive mental health team with more meds you can shake a stick at. None of which work. Diazepam helps but that’s it. 

I don’t see a way out. Not in a dramatic way but the thought of leaving my dad alone isn’t holding me here as much as it used to. If there was a simple pill I could take to sleep forever I would. I have enough bisoprolol to do it, I’m just clinging onto the cliff edge with my fingernails. 

I don’t know what else to say, me and him work part time together in the evenings and I’ve not gone back to work with him yet I just can’t bring myself to do it.

I’m looking at booking a 12 night Tasmania cruise from Brisbane on the Grand Princess with my family for my birthday. I know that this ship is a bit polarising, but it being dated/old doesn’t concern me (I actually prefer the older, classic cruise style ships). I’m more concerned about crowding. I sailed on the P&O Encounter last year, and after cruising since I was a child it was by far the most disappointing - it felt so overcrowded to the point it was overwhelming. We could never get a seat for any activities, the bars were always fully packed, I would get a coffee from the atrium with my partner and there would be nowhere to sit and relax. It felt like we had to stand or miss out on things for majority of the cruise. I know that the Grand Princess is in the same class of ship and has a similar layout to the Encounter, so I was wondering if anyone has had this similar experience on the Grand? 

I have been on one previous Princess cruise on the Sea Princess and absolutely loved it, so would love to try sailing with them again, but am a little cautious of the Grand class ships! Any details of your experiences would be greatly appreciated! 😁",1,1770630123.0,PrincessCruises,1,1.0,False

The kids stopped visiting after her death. I guess I wasn’t around much.

My only friend is the television. I flick through channels until something clicks. Something always does. Last week it was Animal Planet. This week it’s Fashion TV. The skinny girls remind me of the Playboy models I used to ogle at during my teenage years. Now I can do it again, although I don’t feel anything anymore.

Time for coffee. The electric kettle broke, so I use the gas burner now. I’ve burned myself several times because the wheelchair can only reach so high. Sometimes I mix the powder with plain water and enjoy the cold, bitter taste. I drink it like poison, hoping the next sip takes me away.

I don’t eat much, but I love having an orange with my cup of coffee. The flies seem to love it too. I see bigger flies now. I took the trash out last week, but I don’t have the courage today. Maybe tomorrow.

My wife loved scented candles. She had one for each occasion. Monday smelled like vanilla. Tuesday smelled like lavender. And so on. I close my eyes, and I can smell the memories: me leaving for the office after breakfast, while she kisses me on the cheek. Or the time we ran out of candles and our house felt so unfamiliar.

Now the house smells of rotten eggshells and fruit peels. The smell follows me everywhere, even after I bathe. It’s on my clothes too. I light a vanilla candle.

Time for dinner. I can only cook a French omelette, so I do that. Last year my wife would fix a savoury meal for me. But today, a toast and an omelette will do. I finish my meal and the alarm rings. The doctor told me to urinate regularly or my bladder would burst.

The bathroom door is too narrow for the wheelchair. I apply the brakes and get up slowly. I waddle to the toilet seat. I could run a marathon next week! The floor is dry, but my foot slips. I try to grab the washbasin, but it falls under my weight.

I am standing in my bedroom. The air smells putrid. A sickly sweet and pungent smell. The room glows from the faint candlelight and the TV flicker. I move to the edge of the bathroom door.

I see my shell lying in a pool of blood. And my gangrenous right foot, with pus oozing out.

Big guy here looking for chill folk to get to know and become friendly with over the coming days. I like to think I’m pretty laid back and can hold a conversation, whether it’s through chatting, the odd voice note, or over mic if gaming together.

About me? Big gaymer, currently finishing up Elden Ring’s DLC before hopping into something a bit comfier and cozy. I play on PS5 mostly though have a Switch 2 as well. In terms of multiplayer, I stick to DBD mostly, though I’ve recently reinstalled Overwatch and found myself utterly confused by the slew of new characters and their abilities. Though I’m a little rusty, I do quite like to write and get imaginative at times. Headspace and life commitments don’t always allow for it, however!

Hoping to get to know folk from the UK purely because of time zones. And hey, if we hit it off, I’d always be down for a coffee sometime if you’re local. I’m not one to expect instant replies (or a reply at all, at times) and I’d hope you feel the same way. Life does take precedent and sometimes a little time away from the screen does the world of good.

golden goose superstar

Got stopped twice at the bodega asking if these were real. Distressed toe looks intentional, not sloppy. But my arches screamed after 3 hours—cute, not comfy.

dior b30

Heavy as hell. Like, “did they pour concrete in the sole?” heavy. But that CD logo catches streetlight just right. Paired with black jeans and suddenly I look like I have a trust fund.

nike everyday socks

$ 15 for 3 pairs? Hard pass. First wash: one shrank to toddler size, second lost the swoosh like a sad sticker, third developed a heel hole before I even left the house. Felt like wearing tissue paper. Stick to Uniqlo. Or literally anything else.

stone island hoodie

That compass patch on the sleeve? Still crisp after two washes. Fabric’s thick enough for 50°F mornings but won’t cook you. Threw it on with jeans and called it a fit. Zero effort.

carhartt wip script hoodie

Feels like I stole it from my dad’s closet in 2003. Soft, slightly faded, zero stiffness. Wore it to grab coffee and felt weirdly confident. My cat’s currently napping in it. High praise.

corteiz superior hoodie

Back says “CORTEIZ” with a crown + French text I can’t pronounce. Front’s completely blank—love that. Stranger said “nice hoodie,” zero follow-up. Vibe over logo, always.

stussy grey crewneck

Tiny scribble logo on chest—barely visible unless you’re staring. Fit’s relaxed but not drowning me. Perfect for days I want to look intentional without screaming “I tried.”

nike x stussy sweatpants

Mini box logo on thigh = quiet flex. Elastic cuffs stay put, no sagging when I crouch for the dog. Wore these to walk the block and felt zero guilt about being comfy.

gallery dept painted flare pants

Splatter paint looks like I DIY’d after two beers… but cool. Black cuffs keep it from looking messy. Paired with a plain white tee—suddenly I’m in a street style pic. My mom would side-eye these. I adore them.

​I’m writing this because I’m genuinely baffled by the lack of collective outcry regarding a major quality issue affecting the entire Breville (Sage) espresso machine lineup: The Group Head Peeling/Flaking.
What I find most disturbing is the complete lack of engineering improvement despite the potential health risks. We are talking about chemical coatings and metallic particles flaking off into a beverage consumed daily.
​Why hasn't Breville switched to a solid stainless steel or high-grade brass insert for the group head across all models?
​How can a company continue to iterate on screens and software while leaving a fundamentally flawed material in the path of our water and coffee?
​It's one thing to have a cosmetic scratch; it's another to have a machine that literally sheds its skin into your espresso.​I want to understand if the community is actually okay with this. These machines are often recommended as the ""gold standard"" for home baristas, but we are essentially buying products with a built-in expiration date—and a health question mark—on the most critical component.
​Has your group head started peeling? How did Breville support handle it? I think it's time we stop treating this as an individual ""bad luck"" scenario and start holding the brand accountable.

This week it rained an astounding amount for one of the sunniest cities in Europe, and so I took the metro far more than I normally would.

In terms of financial goals, I would like to buy a flat here (which may mean emptying my investment account to borrow less).

I've converted all currencies to € for ease except for investments.

# Monthly income:

Varies because I’m self employed, but averages to about €3,000/month—with about €865 in rental income *(all post-tax)*. The rental income is from a flat in a VHCOL city in the US and that amount is post mortgage and monthly fees. 

# Monthly expenses: 

Rent: €1,280 (incl. internet) for a small furnished 2-bedroom in the city center. This is slightly above market rate for the size but I wanted something furnished and renovated.

Utilities are around €55 - utilities in this country are very expensive. My flat has an A energy rating and I use barely any electricity

€5 phone plan

€30/US phone (yes I need to just cut this)

€15,37 renter’s insurance (€184,48 paid annually)

€27 US homeowner’s insurance ($384 paid annually)

€9,3 Spotify

**Monthly total: About €1,421 (at current exchange rate, with slight fluctuations in utility bill.**

# Investments:

Max out IRA = $625/monthly 

Approx. \~$30k in short-term savings (easily accessible) and \~$356,000 in investments across brokerage and IRA

My property in the US is worth \~$500,000. I have just under \~$200k left on the mortgage at 1.5%.

**Annual costs:**

I get a haircut \~5x a year at €37 so I'd say €185

I have a train discount card that costs €59/year

# Sunday:

7:45: Reluctantly get up because I have a ton of work to do. Drink a glass of water, and pour a glass of cold brew, which I make every few days from a 1kg bag of beans in the freezer. Shower, shave, wash my hair (in winter, I wash every 2 days).

10: Decide to try and clean out the fridge, so breakfast is: sautéed broccolini, half a purple sweet potato, red rice, black beans, an egg, avocado, and feta, with some za’atar. (I picked up the eggs €6/12 and the broccoli (€3,5/kg) Saturday when I did a quick farmers’ market walk-through).

10:45: Put on sunscreen (a 400ml bottle of Biotherm SPF50 I bought last summer), then go for a 20-minute walk in the sun while listening to BBC. Buy a big piece of ginger and a stem of cherry tomatoes **(€1,40)**

11:15: Go to my desk and work on a few articles and research.

14:00: Eat a pear and cardamom muffin (vegan, no refined sugar, and they are really good!) from a batch I made last weekend and froze. 

16: Eat another muffin.

19:30: It’s 7 degrees and damp. I’m already wearing wool socks so put on heat tech tights that are probably 15 years old, a heat tech ultra warm long sleeve shirt, black jeans, black cashmere crewneck, and thermal Blundstones. Walk to a northern Chinese restaurant about 25 minutes away. My friend and I share egg and tomato; I get vegetable dumplings, encouraging her to try a few, and she gets something with pork. **€17** for my half. Walk home listening to the news.

**Total: €18,4**

# Monday: 

7:15: Get up to go to the bathroom. Turn on all the lights, then decide I’ll try and go back to sleep.

9: Roll out of bed, drink water and cold brew. Make the same breakfast as yesterday, which I eat over the next 1.5 while working. Shower and put on sunscreen.

11:30: Take the metro to and from dermatologist appt **€3,4**

13: Working at home

14:35: Order grocery delivery of dry goods — 500g of sunflower seeds, 1kg of buckwheat, 500g of almonds, 1kg chickpeas, 3L olive oil, 800g can of crushed tomatoes, 3kg of oats, 1kg of whole wheat flour, 1kg of spelt flour, 3 1L boxes of milk = **€63,63**. I place an order like every 4-ish months. 

14:45: Eat another muffin.

15:45: Make and eat some stir fry — ginger, garlic, carrot, tofu, broccoli, and red rice, topped with a bit of chilli crisp and furikake. I wouldn’t normally eat lunch this late but I’m meeting friends later and we may or may not have dinner.

16: Go down the block to the pharmacy to get a prescription cream.

18: There’s a free talk on the future of media tonight at a museum. It’s free seating so I leave to get there 30 minutes early. It’s raining, so I get in the metro. I normally walk everywhere or sometimes take the bus or a bike, so this is the most I’ve been on the metro in months. **€1,7**

21:00. The talk is super interesting. It’s stopped raining so my friend and I walk 3km home, debriefing on the talk and life in general. It’s hard to make friends as an adult, especially in your late 30s, so I’m really happy we met through a mutual friend.

22:30: Read for an hour (William Boyd’s Ordinary Thunderstorms). Go to bed but then wake up at 12:30 to go to the bathroom and it’s tough to go back to sleep.

**Total: €68,73 (later the olive oil is out of stock, so €30 refund for a total of €38,73)**

# Tuesday

8:00am: Wake up, glass of water, glass of cold brew, and a bowl of plain yogurt with pomegranate seeds (I de-seeded a pomegranate last week for a salad and froze the remaining seeds), bee pollen, chia, flax, and some granola I made months ago (cf. the bulk barley and oats).

I take this to my desk and start my daily 20-minutes of scrolling through flat listing and the news. Try to clean up up my inbox. Start editing some articles.

10:30: Take a shower and put on the same thing I wear every day in winter: wool socks, jeans, long-sleeve heat tech shirt (at least a decade old) and one of my three cashmere crewnecks. Put on sunscreen.

11: Put in a load of darks. I’m going to a friend’s for dinner later so walk to the flower kiosk to get her a bouquet of mimosas, which are in peak bloom right now. The flower kiosk is next to the market, so I check the fridge to see if I need anything. I decide that I have enough vegetables to make lunch today. 

The first kiosk doesn’t have any mimosas so I go to the 2nd, a block down, which is also out. Then I walk to a flower shop and they, too, have no mimosas. I’ll deal with it later.

12: Hang my laundry to dry, then roast an eggplant, chickpeas with za’atar, and two heads of garlic. 

13: Knock up some baba ganoush with the roasted garlic, tahini, olive oil, lemon, and some za’atar have it on a spinach salad (bought Saturday at the market, €2,5/kg) with the roasted chickpeas, a couple of sardines, caramelised onions, a handful of sesame seeds, and half a pita from the freezer.

The sardines were in the cupboard and were around €2,55/tin; the caramelised onions I made and froze a few weeks ago, and the onions probably cost €1,50 for \~8-10 small red onions, and the pita — some of the best I’ve ever had in 3.5 decades of pita-eating, is from an Egyptian restaurant (€1/each)

You can see that cooking and eating things from the freezer is a daily affair.

16 We’re having crepes for dinner so I walk 10 minutes to a bottle shop to pick up some cider. Will the florist next door have mimosas? Yes! I got 2 types of extra dry cider **(€11)** and a massive bouquet of mimosas **€12)**.

16:45 Back to work trying to get images for an article. 

19 Plan to walk to my friend’s for dinner but it’s raining. Jump on the metro **€1,7**

22:30: Dinner was so good — piles of sweet and savoury crepes and lots of catching up between 4 of us discussing our two favourite subjects: work drama and real estate. With one friend who lives nearby we walk 2km home.

00:15: I read for 45 minutes and go to bed — this is very late for me on a weeknight!

**Total: €24,7**

# Wednesday

8:45 am: Get up, get a glass of water, and start working.

9:45 am: Drink a glass of cold brew and make breakfast — plain yogurt, the last of the pomegranate seeds, bee pollen, chia, flax, granola (running low, maybe I’ll make more this weekend). Take this to my desk.

11:30: Shower and wash my hair.

12: Still eating my yogurt. Put in a load of whites (sheets and a pair of slippers)

13: Hang everything to dry. I’m staring down a mountain of deadlines and had not planned to leave my desk today except that I’m meeting a friend for a film screening a bit out of the city center, and we planned to eat beforehand but discover no restaurants will be open that early. We decided to bring some empanadas with us, so I put on sunscreen, then walk 10 minutes to pick up 4 empanadas—eggplant and spinach and cheese for me, chicken and ham and cheese for her **€16** 

14: Pressed for time, I put some red rice, cooked spinach, romaine my friend gave me yesterday, sardines, roasted chickpeas, and the last of the caramelised onions in a bowl with a little slug of olive oil and some sesame seeds. Eat at my desk.

14:15 Make a piece of toast from the freezer to sop up the olive oil (I bought a loaf of wholegrain bread months ago when a friend was visiting and have a few slices left).

14:30 None of my sources are responding to emails or calls. Keep fact-checking another story.

16:15: I eat a carrot. It’s raining again. This is very unusual; it’s sunny almost every day here, to the point that in summer there’s often a drought risk. One person replies to my request for information for an article.

17:35: The film screening tonight is at a cinema not well connected to public transport, so I give myself a solid 1 hour to get there. I wore a wool coat and sneakers out earlier but put on a waterproof jacket and boots. My friend and I decide we’ll meet at the bus so I walk 20 minutes there listening to a podcast about Wikipedia. The bus is too packed to reach the card terminal so we pay nothing.

21:30 The film was not bad! It was about protests by farmers in the southwest of this country against industrialisation and environmental distruction. I go to the market a couple of times per week and I really feel for small farms trying to make it. **€7,20** for cinema ticket. My friend and I share an Uber home - she pays.

22: Put sheets on my bed, then read for an hour.

**Total: €23,2**

# Thursday

6:11: Roll over and look at the clock. No way.

7:55: This is better. The usual glasses of water and cold brew, which I take to my desk. Delete and triage emails, check the news, look at flat listings.

8:45 am: The usual yogurt, this time with peaches I froze the end of summer. Eat at my desk. 

10: I finished half the yogurt and put the bowl in the fridge for later or tomorrow morning. Take a quick rinse and put on sunscreen. 

I’m going to a friend’s tonight and plan to bring baba ganoush. Before going to the market I look in the fridge: I still have plenty of broccolini, spinach, and one carrot. Gather my yogurt containers of compost to drop off at the bin. At the market I get 1 aubergine, and two stems of cherry tomatoes **(€2,30)**. 

I’m low on yogurt so I check Lidl first—they have none but I get a kg of coffee beans for cold brew **(€13,05)** which should last me 2 months —then go to a second supermarket nearby and get 1kg of 10% fat Greek yogurt **(€5,35)**. I eat so much yogurt and every time I buy it, I tell myself I should make it at home… and then I don’t. 

I stop at a hardware store to get a key ring as mine has broken **(€0,65)**. **Total €21,35**

11:15: Eat a carrot at my desk.

12:30: Roast one eggplant and some grated tofu tossed with dukkah. The eggplant is for later. For lunch, a clean-out-the-fridge bowl with red rice, baba ganoush, sautéed shallot and broccolini, grated tofu, roasted chickpeas, a bit of radish kimchi (purchased months ago), and the last half pita from the freezer. I’ll get more tomorrow. 

Grind beans for a batch of cold brew. Put the leftovers in the fridge and blitz the aubergine with roasted garlic and tahini. Realise I’m out of lemons and even though I can *see* the greengrocer from my window, I really don’t have time to run out. I decide to decorate the top of the baba ganoush with crushed pistachios and walnuts to make up for the missing citrus.

13:20  Freelance haiku: I’m back at my desk. Please, why does no one reply? Just following up. 

17:20: Try to tweeze two small chin hairs but only manage to get one one; the other is too short to grasp.

17:30: Put on a podcast and leave to walk 30 minutes to my friend’s with the baba ganoush and some some seeded crackers I bought in Italy last month. By the time I’m passing the metro entrance it’s pouring and I duck in. **€1,7**

My friend has a glass of wine and I have some tea, and two of her other friends eventually join us. 

20:30 Same situation in reverse: it’s pouring and I again take the metro and am home in 10 minutes, relatively dry. **€1,7**

20:45 Back at my desk to chase a few sources by phone.

22:15 Get in bed and read for an hour (still William Boyd’s Ordinary Thunderstorms).

**Total: €24,75**

# Friday

7:55am: Glass of water, glass of cold brew. Someone has replied to a request for a quote, so I add it and send the article for editing.

8:15: Daily scroll through flat listings and the news. Respond to emails and eat the rest of yesterday’s yogurt.

9:15: Fold my sheets that have been drying since Wednesday morning.

9:30: I have a mountain of articles to write, edit, fact-check, etc, *but* the sun is out for the first time in more than a week (this is in one of the sunniest cities in Europe!) so I slather on sunscreen and leave it all behind to meet my friend for a walk along the sea.

https://preview.redd.it/cqm2uecvufig1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fcb21bee325f22f00436ee0dd62f599779fd99b0

12:45 It was glorious outside. We walked 10k along the water, sat on a bench with the sun on our faces, talk about everything (word, friends, real estate, the usual). On the way home I stopped at the pharmacy to get some prescription cream. 

Back at my desk, I put on a random playlist (M83, Gorillaz, Wanda Jackson, Jitwam, Clara Luciani) and eat leftovers from yesterday with some chimichurri sauce that came with the empanadas.

15:30 Eat a piece of wholegrain sourdough toast from the freezer with peanut butter

17:15 Eat some sliced peach frozen over the summer. A few sources respond for stories.

19: I make a very random pasta for dinner: a red onion, anchovy, and tomato paste base with two handfuls of cherry tomatoes, cannellini beans, a bunch of spinach, and some too-strong chill flakes. I add a packet of whole grain gnocchi and let them cook in the sauce.

It’s not bad; but wouldn’t buy these gnocchi again. They were on offer at Lidl, but both cooked in the oven and in sauce, they’re a bit gummy. (Everything was in the fridge or pantry except the tomatoes from yesterday and the spinach from last Saturday).

19:20 Eat my desk of course! I normally eat at my kitchen table—and often on Fridays I go out or over to friends’—but I have a lot of deadlines this week and next, and am travelling two days on assignment, and so I’m trying to be efficient (barring my 3-hour break this morning).

21: Stop working, start the dishwasher, etc, and read Ordinary Thunderstorms.

23: Go to bed

**Total:** €0

# Saturday

8: Wake up, drink a glass of water, and empty the dishwasher. At my desk, the usual morning scroll: email triage, news, flat listings.

9:20: Wash my Dutch oven and wooden spatula from last night, then drink half a glass of cold brew, put on sunscreen, jeans, and a sweatshirt, brush my teeth and walk to the market.

9:50: I’m back with 5 small apples, a mini butternut, a bunch of rainbow chard, 2 carrots, 2 blood oranges, an avocado, a few stems of cherry tomatoes and they gave me a bunch of parsley. **(€11,7)** 

https://preview.redd.it/rk5cyo4xufig1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0309a400050d3b2db589b3dc7609f826cf9286e

10:00am: Finish the glass of cold brew and eat a small bowl of pasta, adding some harissa to zhuzh it up. Book my train to go on assignment next week (**€49** return; I’ll be reimbursed when the story publishes). Eat at my desk editing some sections of a book and listening to a random playlist. 

I would like to take a shower but my dry goods grocery delivery window is 8am-noon, and normally the delivery person calls and I run down to meet them, so I need to wait until that’s sorted.

12:30 Heat up another small bowl of pasta.

12:55: Run downstairs to meet the delivery guy. A perfect 2-second handoff. Lug the bags back upstairs. 

13:45 Finish writing an article and go take a shower.

14:30 I make a small and pretty random salad: romaine, parsley, broccolini and red rice crisped up in a pan, feta, and the last of the baba ganoush, with leftover chimichurri as the dressing. 

15: I decide to make apple muffins. The base is a mix of almond, oat, and spelt flours, with a little honey, chia eggs, cardamom, cinnamon, and ginger, walnuts, and sunflower seeds on top.

This batch is not bad, but not as good as last week’s—I think the apples didn’t lend enough moisture or I used too much oat flour. After eating one, I put the rest in a silicone bag in the freezer. 

16:20 Since the grocery delivery site was out of big tins of olive oil, my friend who belongs to a food co-op offered me to shop with her. I walk 30 min to meet her there and get a 3L tin of olive oil, a bag of farro pasta, 2 tins of sardines, and a 500g jar of dark tahini **(€50,88)**. We live a block apart and take the tram home together **(€1,7)**

18:45: I’m going to a birthday party tonight and I don’t know if there will be food there, so I sauté a little bit of broccoli with red rice and an egg, and top it with furikake. 

19: Meet my grocery friend on our corner to walk together to the birthday party (30 min). I organised the group gift a month ago—a voucher for 2 for a ceramics workshop, and a voucher for the art supply store near her house (€20/my part, paid in January). Bring a bottle of wine that someone brought to my house two weeks ago. The birthday friend lives next to an Egyptian restaurant, so I get 3 pita and my friend gets one (I pay **€4**).

01:00: The party was so fun! It was a murder mystery party in which I managed to make 5 kills. Arrive home on foot (30 min), read until 1:30 and go to bed.

**Total: €68,28 (not including the €49 train ticket for which I’ll be reimbursed)**

**Weekly total: €203,163**

***Groceries:*** *€127,41*

***Public transport:*** *€11,9*

***Restaurants:*** *€33*

***Misc:*** *€23,65*

I would say this was a fairly average week except for taking the metro 7 times. I also did not make time for any home workouts. It’s not *that* often that I do something every evening. I also usually cook one more larger meal (often a curry in winter). I place dry goods bulk delivery orders roughly every 3-4 months and my average weekly grocery cost is closer to €35-40.

I would say I’m relatively frugal. I’m also quite minimalist: I don’t have or buy a lot, and I try to buy everything secondhand where possible. I really like to cook — I would say I go out to eat 2x a month — and eat a pretty healthy diet, so I don’t skimp on ingredients (for example, there are less expensive tahinis and olive oils, etc). I buy goods in bulk when it makes sense (e.g. the 1kg of coffee beans). I hardly drink so I very rarely buy alcohol, which of course saves a lot.

My spending varies a bit: some weeks I work most evenings and so I don’t go anywhere except on walks, and thus I spend little outside of groceries. I do usually have friends over once a week for dinner. Some weeks I travel, for example 2 weeks ago I was in Eastern/Central Europe to research a story and my accommodations were covered but I still spent \~€140 on transport and \~50 on food. Last week I bought a ticket to visit friends in Madrid in March (€152,08).

1qzzta2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_maranimalworkstuff/comments/1qzzta2/s/,s,"From my title, I feel I should explain right away that my cats have never come to work with me. I've had 2 pictures at my desk (Front Office Manager) since my first week at this job (I no longer work there, and thank goodness). 1 picture of my dog, and the other picture of my 2 cats. They rarely come up in conversation.

After like 8ish months in this job, my boss asks me to do task force at another property down the road that is also owned by the same company. I said sure, because let's be honest, there's no way I could say no. 

My boss said she has no idea what they will want me to do there. It might be front desk, housekeeping, or F&B. I have less experience in F&B, but it's also a much smaller property. So, whatever, I guess. It is explained to me that the other property is a union hotel, and we are not, so it will be very different, and I will need to be very careful. 

I'm told the GM there will explain everything when I get there. Okay. I asked about parking and my GM didn't know. I emailed the other GM and she never answered me. Our accounting manager worked for both properties and he explained the parking to me.

My first day at the other property, the GM does not meet with me for over an hour. I tried to log in on the computer, but wasn't given any login info. I called the help desk and they had no record in their system of an ID being created for me. 

When the GM finally came back around, I asked her about it, and she said she definitely did set up an ID and password for me. I called support again, and they still could not find me. I spelled my name a few times, provided my date of birth, but still nothing. 

My GM digs through her emails and papers on her desk and finally locates it. My name was spelled wrong, which is why support couldn't find me. Again, whatever, I can log in. Great.

I ask what she would like me to do and she has no idea. She had someone else doing task force, and she was working on a new menu for the restaurant. Housekeeping was pretty well staffed. The restaurant only put frozen pizzas in an oven and sold deli sandwiches that were pre-packaged, and there was a bartender to serve coffee and alcohol. 

It was a shitty restaurant, so they averaged about 2 guests a day. They didn't need anyone else helping out in there. The front desk was a little shorter staffed, so I was assigned to go there.

I was super cautious around the staff at this hotel, fearing a grievance because I didn't have a rulebook for the union, and never worked at a union property before. But they were pretty nice. Not much out of the ordinary from what I'm used to. 

I asked them to be patient because I was unfamiliar with the union, and always asked if it was okay if I did this or that before I did it.

One night, one of the girls at the front desk was going on her break, which was 1 hour, per the union. She said her husband made dinner and packed it for her and she was looking forward to it. 

I said that was really nice, and I hope she enjoyed it. She asked if I was married, and I told her I am not. She asked if I was single, and I said yes, so she asked if I lived alone, or had a roommate or pets. I said no roommate, but I have pets. 

I said I have a dog and 2 cats. I showed her 1 picture of all 3 of my pets together. She said they were cute, and then she went on her break. That was all. That was the entire interaction. It was under 5 minutes, and there were no guests around, and no phone calls. It was January, so really slow.

When I got back to my actual job, after about a month of task force, I get called into HR, where the HR manager and my GM have a 45 minute meeting with me because they wanted to know why the union employees at the other hotel knew about my cats. 

I was confused, but told them that the one girl asked if I had pets, I said yes, showed her 1 picture, and that was it. It's really no different than the pictures I have on display at my desk.

She said it was really inappropriate that they knew about my cats. I pointed out that I knew about her (my GM's) dogs. She had a massive portrait of her 2 dogs in her office. She is quick to point out that those are DOGS. Not cats. 

I said ""But you also have cats? You told me about your cats months ago. You showed me a picture of them. That's the same thing I did."" She says to me ""Almost NO ONE knows that I have CATS.""

I swear, this was the weirdest meeting I have ever been apart of. She went on to say that the other GM was disappointed with my ""lack of initiative."" One thing she specifically said was that I kept bothering her for login information when I should have been calling support myselft to get it set up.

I don't know if you realize this, but the help desk won't just create a login for anyone that calls and asks. Even after I got my login info, I called again to ask for more permissions, because I had less authorization than a supervisor, and I couldn't do the functions of my job with the access I was given. 

Support said that only the GM can change the access level. So I asked her 3 times, and it was never fixed. I also called support again to see if a different agent would give me a different answer, but they didn't.

The really fun thing was that there was a new system for guest complaints, and it was impossible to find anything. I would regularly respond to cases and then not be able to find that case again. 

One day the GM was working on one I had already closed out, and I told her it was all set, and she didn't believe me. I don't remember if that one was a call or a chat that I did with support, but in any case, I talked with support about that case and they confirmed it was closed and that I had issued compensation.

All of this was explained (and had been documented in the support logs) to my GM and HR, but I was written up anyway for not taking initiative, even though all of my tasks were completed, and I never got an initial meeting with that GM to discuss what I would be doing there. She just told me to go to the front desk and my initiative figured out everything else.

Oh, I was also criticized for taking too long to get a uniform catalog and set up billing for the vendor, but I had email correspondence with the company where they rescheduled our meeting. 

The write-up I got was very vague, mostly focusing on my lack of initiative, and inability to get login information without help. I wrote in the comment box that this was a grossly inaccurate statement, but I didn't even know what else to say because the whole thing came out of nowhere and was completely ridiculous.

This 45 minute meeting was like, 80% about my cats. I don't even know how, but every few minutes we would circle back to my cats. The other girl on task force also had cats and showed me a picture of her cats. I pointed that out and it was brushed off, just like my GM having cats herself, and me being aware of her cats was brushed off. 

HR also had a cat, and she had a picture of her cat at her desk also. But that's different. Or so I was told. Cats were not mentioned in the write-up document, and I received a written warning instead of a verbal, and I had no prior disciplinary action against me. I did not get grieved by the union.

I didn't take my cats into work. I didn't spend all day talking about them. They came up in polite conversation on a couple of occasions, each time taking up less than 5 minutes, with no other tasks being interrupted. Equivalent to asking a coworker how their weekend was.

It seemed to me that everyone thought I would get a grievance, but I didn't, and everyone actually liked me just fine. But union employees liking me = bad, so they had to start the process of getting rid of me. That's the only sense I've ever been able to make of this. 

Anyway, my cats are awesome, and now I have 3 of them, plus my dog, who is also awesome.

My partner and I have been in LDR for almost 2 yrs now. So overthinking, doubts are inevitable.

Early 2025, I found out that she cheated on someone for me(way back 2023), she was not proud of that, and she showed me that she regrets not telling it to me. My trust was broken, and i got paranoid, thinking she might end up doing it to me too. But she changed, she did all that she can to get my trust back, she assured me everytime, she even gave all her accounts so that I have no worries if she’ll talk to someone else. We always call, we have life360 on. She never failed to assure me, she keeps proving me that she’s changed, and that she’s sure and wants to have a family with me one day. I trusted her and gave it another chance.

I’m still paranoid that she’ll one day get tired and choose to be with another man because of our LDR. But she keeps on proving to me that I’m all that she wants and that she will never do it to me. Continues updates, she even tells me if someone messaged her, or if someone’s trying to hit on her, she just ignores them.

Months went by, a lot of cheating issues got trending all around social media. So I still get paranoid, she constantly updates me of her whereabouts and constantly reassured me that she will never cheat.

She once had a group of friends but now theyre very distant, and recently she’s been sharing with me that she’s sad, she even cried to me because she still has no friends in Canada, a group of friends that she can be with, to spend her leisure time with. To have a “getaway” from work because she’s on graveyard shift. Then she became friends with someone from her work and its a guy. She hid it from me, and admits that she was talking to her workmate after a few days. She said she was sorry because she didn’t want me to “overthink” the situation thats why she hid it from me. They were talking non stop, tho there was no flirting because she even asked me to look up their messages so that I’ll feel relieved that there is no any signs of “unfaithfulness” but days before she admitted, she was looking for someone to have coffee with, then she brought her coworker along with her. That time she never mentioned that she’s with somebody, she only told me that she’s gonna get coffee.

So fast forward to when she admitted it, then I found out that she went with the guy, I got mad. I told her why did she hide it from me. And I got to a point where I’m doubting her non stop. Then she asked if I want her to stop talking to him. I said “bahala ka, buhay mo yan” assuming that she’ll think that I’m uncomfortable with the coworker and stop talking to him.  I always look at her messages with the guy, and they still talk non stop. Tho there’s no any signs of her flirting just pure work related stuff and “canada things”. She’s even irritated when the guy tries to flirt and impress her. So I got mad again, told her that why is she still talking to his coworker knowing that the guy is trying to flirt and impress her and I’m uncomfortable. She said she asked me if i wanted her to stop talking to the guy and she thought “akala ko bahala ako sa buhay ko”. She even told me that she doesn’t see the guy as a flirting kind, she knew him as a guy that’s friendly with “women”. She even tries to link her old friend to him to get him to flirt to.

She constantly assures me that she just wants a friend from work, because she’s been working for almost half a year now and she still have no “work friends” (mainly because her coworkers are old) and that she has no other intentions, even tells me to look at her messages if she’s trying to “flirt”.

Then one day i got worried, because she has work, and yet she still hasn’t messaged me. Thinking that she got in danger because even her mother’s not responding to me. So I thought of messaging her coworker friend, because I saw that she’s not even replying to him. I introduced myself as the “boyfriend left a message asking for a favor. Since her house is just a distance away from work. Then fast forward, she just overslept, then saw my message to the coworker then immediately deleted it. i asked why, she replied and said that it was unnecessary because she’s not in danger, she just overslept.

Then we fought, i asked why do I feel like she’s trying to hide me from the guy. Why was my message “unnecessary”. She got mad also because she keeps telling me that she has no other intentions with the guy, she just wanted a friend. And yet here I am overthinking things, putting meanings to her actions toward the guy, even though she constantly assures me that she’s not trying to do stupid things.

She got to a point where she got tired of reassuring me, she got full. She got tired of proving herself that she’s trustworthy. And i know its also my fault for not giving all of my trust in her. But can you blame me? I feel threatened.

Then she asked for a space, she said that she’s exhausted from her graveyard 6 days of work and our shit happened, she wanted to think things through if she wanted to continue our relationsip because of LDR and she thinks that our relationship is going nowhere because she keeps on reassuring me and yet I still doubt and overthink things and I’m still paranoid.

So I’m trying to chase her back, I wanna prove that I can change, put in the same effort as she did to reassure me.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day.

Just launched on Product Hunt and would love your roast. 😅","I’ve been working on this for the last few weeks, and today I finally pushed the big  ""Launch"" button.

**The Problem:** I tried every budgeting app out there. I always quit after two weeks because manually opening an app, choosing a category, and typing ""$5.50 for coffee"" felt like a second job.

**The Solution (SmartWalt):** I built an Android app that uses AI to remove the friction.

* **Voice-First:** You just say ""Spent 47 on groceries"" -> it logs & categorizes it instantly.
* **Receipt OCR:** Snap a photo -> it extracts the vendor, date, and total.
* **AI Coach:** Instead of digging through charts, you just ask ""Can I afford dinner?"" and it gives you a real answer.

**The Tech Stack:** For those curious, I built this with **Flutter** (frontend) and **AWS + LangChain** (backend) to handle the voice processing agents.

**The Ask:** We are currently live on Product Hunt and fighting for visibility. If you have an Android phone, I’d genuinely appreciate you trying it out. 😅

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking.

1qzzmml,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1qzzmml/i_26f_am_angry_at_my_bsf_26f/,I 26F am angry at my bsf 26F,"I’ve had a close friend for 10 years. We are 26 years old. Unfortunately, every time she gets a boyfriend, she abandons her friends and only remembers us when she breaks up. Through many discussions, she has understood that this behavior is unacceptable and has tried to fix it. Until now.

She got pregnant and is getting married. I am generally a very supportive person and I play the “therapist” for everyone. The problems started when her fiancé began to be very jealous of me and my partner. From discussions with others who have heard him talk about us, he is jealous because we are happy, we go out, we are emotionally balanced and financially comfortable.

Personally, I find it ridiculous to be jealous of another couple.

The real issues started when they got pregnant and asked us about our plans. They have been together for 4 months, we have been together for 6. My partner told him the truth: that it’s still too early for us to think about having a child and that we want to enjoy our love first.

I think he felt threatened by that — he has serious insecurities.

In general, many red flags.

I have four incidents that made me not want to speak to them ever again, even if it means sacrificing a long friendship.

1.

We went to their house for a double date and my boyfriend suggested going go-karting. My friend agreed, on the condition that she wouldn’t race and would only watch because of the pregnancy. The guy got angry because she said yes without asking him, and because they would have to pay €15 for karting. That would have been his only expense, since I drive and always pay for the gas! And he got angry about that.

They locked themselves in a room for ONE HOUR and left us waiting outside instead of simply telling us they didn’t want to go. We left without saying goodbye — they were still fighting when we left after an hour of waiting.

2.

I had a celebration at my workplace and I invited them as a double date. Afterward, we went out to eat with  friends of mine and my boyfriend paid for everyone. Everyone asked how much they owed except for them. He wasn’t going to take money from anyone, but it’s a matter of manners and basic decency. It really bothered us.

3.

My friend asked me to go see her after work. I drove 40 minutes to her house and only got to stay for 15 minutes, because her fiancé finished work, came home, and they kicked me out since they had plans to go shopping.

4.

Because of her pregnancy, she constantly talks about her symptoms. She works normally every day and goes to school. But when it’s time for us to go for coffee, she is always “dizzy” and “not feeling well.” We arranged to meet alone after 3 months, and 5 minutes before the meeting she canceled because she was dizzy. Later, I found out that she went on a date with her fiancé!!!

She keeps pressuring me to go out because she misses me, and then she cancels on me!!!

She hasn’t asked how I am for two months. We only talk about weddings and pregnancy, which do not concern me at all. She only talks about herself!

It’s like I’m a real psychologist, but for free!!

I feel sorry for her, because she has no other friends, but I’ve reached my limit. I hate people that only care about themselves. She wasn’t that bad before him!

I don’t know what to do.

I have looked into the Magnifica Plus model and really would like to buy it. Unfortunately, the spot I would like to place it on has a depth of around 400mm only, while the magnifica Plus is 440mm. Do you think this would be an issue or is there any better fit for my budget (500 Euros)?

I am rarely drinking espresso, rather longer coffees. But an espresso sometimes is always a good option to have. My current machine is a Philips Senseo pad machine.

In general I drink my coffee black without milk, so milk drinks are not important to me. Maybe the oldest Magnifica S might be an option for me, since it is only 300mm?

He left while I was at work and left me a scathing note, turning me into a person I do not recognize. After much reading online, i’ve learned that he is actually a DA. 

A few weeks before the discard, we got into a fight. Context: my ex is retired, and has no friends and family nearby. I am his only social connection. He constantly complained about how repetitive his life and scenery is, but he never does anything about it. He literally stays home all day, or goes out once to get a cup of coffee. He has projects but he never pushed through with them. I hurry home every day after work knowing that i am his only source of socialization, the only person he talks to. It’s been like this for almost 4 years, so you can imagine that it’s been such a heavy burden on me and i felt suffocated. Plus he’s very pushy and likes to decide things for me until i felt smaller and smaller as a person. In addition, i also don’t have time to socialize because i don’t want to leave him alone, and during the rare times i see my friends, he wants to be invited, and i do sometimes but not all the time because we’d have to speak in English the entire time and most of my friends arent comfortable. 

During our fight, i finally exploded and told him that he was suffocating me and i felt that he was an anchor. Like most of our fights, he DARVOed me and turned me into the problem. I apologized in the moment but i just got so exhausted with the fight and being blamed once more that i walked away.

He gently tried to get me to explain my accusations after a few days, but honestly i was just so tired of fighting that ends up with him not taking any accountability, that i told him “What’s the point?”. I realize now that my actions, complaining about being suffocated, claiming “what’s the point?” sounds like detachment, but it was just exhaustion. I wonder if he thought I was a DA and that i was detaching and removing myself from the relationship.  

A part of me is still hugely in denial that it ended so abruptly. I know i was asking for boundaries and there is nothing wrong with that, but i worry that this was interpreted differently. I now regret being distant and asking for space. 

I’ve learned that DAs want absolutely no contact with an ex… but would it be different in this case? ",1,1770628335.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,0.67,False

It’s winter and there’s snow everywhere here in the Mid-Atlantic region. Looking for cheapies to buy before I start spending $100+ on bottles and exploring more scents.  Cheapies, designers and niche all welcome. Something for the cold, something for when it’s warm. 



Disclaimer: Kind’ve new to this, at least understanding notes, opening, drydown, sillage, etc. 



I’ve worn Versace Pour Homme since highschool. That and Guess Seductive Homme have been my most frequent buys. Typically pick them up from Marshalls or Burlington. 



I blind bought YSL Myslf EDP, YSL Y EDP and Versace L’Homme during the Holidays. Definitely going full size on the YSL’s. Been wearing Myslf and I like it a lot. I’ve been mixing that and Versace L’Homme in an atomizer and wearing that mainly the past few months. Going to start wearing Y more when it gets warmer out. 



Versace Pour Homme is like my go to fresh scent, It’s a little spicy or peppery in the opening but dries down very fresh. I often apply this after a shower just to chill or go to sleep. Doesn’t last too long before becoming a skin scent in my opinion. 



Versace L’Homme is definitely a more mature scent and I can see why people don’t like it or it’s outdated. The opening can be harsh but I like the dry down. Also I know nobody else around me is going to be wearing this. 



YSL Y is fresh and performs well. A modern masculine smell, but it’s nothing too special, I think it’d be a nice daily wear in warmer weather. 



YSL Myslf is fresh and sweet to me, kind of mass appealing and generic but definitely not boring. Can be a bit strong in some circumstances. 



Both YSL’s have nice longevity though. Both fresh and sweet, with Myslf being less fruity.



Guess Seductive Homme gives that typical mass appealing “masculine” vibe but sweeter and fresher. 



Pure Vibe for Men by Karen Low is very “Abercrombie”, that’s what it reminds me of. Not bad but I think a lot of stuff smells like this. Or this is a stereotypical modern “masculine” smell. Reminds me of Abercrombie and Hollister. This was a gift. 

Don’t get me wrong, I had Abercrombie fragrances in middle school, but that’s exactly the point as well lol. Doesn’t last long at all and can be a bit aggressive



The 1956 Black by Tru Fragrance is much sweeter and fresher, which is kind’ve what I lean towards more when looking for scents but still generic and mass appealing to me. Kind of reminds me of Nautica Blue Sail. 



I made my own fragrance on a date in 2024 but I still don’t have an understanding of notes completely. I like it a lot, I’d just say the result wasn’t the most intentional. I was just mixing stuff I liked. It’s really floral and a bit soapy. I could see it being a women’s or unisex fragrance. 



I tried Story of Bois De Guaiac & Amber Woods by Prince Parfums Dubai at Parfuroma at Tanger Outlets in PA. I liked these a lot and the longevity and sillage was amazing in my opinion. I was willing to buy at least one, or the discovery set and told the sales lady I would be back after doing some more shopping. I looked up the fragrances and seen she was up-charging me. I went back and played along but eventually called her out about it but the sales lady kept trying to charge me more and refused to match the online price. She even made claims that “Prince” owns the store and these are his prices, even though she made up 3 different numbers. I asked the other sales lady to service me, she even said she’d give be a better price, but the first lady said “no, you’re my client”. Lol as a salesman myself I was ready to go. She blew the sale for both of them that day. I really like those scents though and will buy online or go back another time. I do find it suspicious that she didn’t try to sell anything else. Even tried to sell my mom the female scents from that line even though she was interested in something else. Lady says “you like nice things? This is nice.”



I just went to Fragrance World a few doors down and bought Vince Camuto Terra for my 17 year old little cousin. The salesman in there showed me different options based on what I asked him and helped me narrow down a pick without being pushy at all. 



Back to my question though. I’ve been looking at reviews and doing my research and Bentley for Men Intense seems like a nice pick up. I smelled Curve for Men by Liz Claiborne and liked that a lot, I remember seeing this bottle when I was younger. YSL Babycat seems like a nice winter wear but out of budget currently. 



My sister’s mom layers Le Labo Santal 33 with Tom Ford Metallique or Ombre Leather (she has both but I forget) and she has a unique smell that I know is her. I like it. 



I’m intrigued by the coffee, whiskey, and chocolate scents and cannabis scents as well. (Never smelled them) The gourmands but not overly sweet like a cupcake or something. My mom always wears vanilla scents so I’m used to that but sometimes that’s annoying, I like vanilla, just not all the time or they’re not all the same. 



But uhh yeah…recommendations?

A heart-touching story… learn from it.

This is something that is very personal and important to me. I hope that you will learn and benefit from it. Let me begin by saying “Bismillah.” When I first started University, I had met another Muslim brother. We had become good friends, but this friendship was not like any other ordinary friendship, I would have done anything for him, he was like my real brother.

During our last year of University, this brother of mine announced that he was engaged and that he was to be married after he graduates this year and finds himself a job. I was glad for him and so was he. He talked non stop about getting married, I was sort of getting jealous of him, because the brother had it made for him, finishing school, getting married and especially coming from a wealthy family.

One day this brother was to meet me at the coffee shop. He showed up, but astonishingly he wasn’t smiling and wasn’t talking about his fiancée. I asked him what was wrong, he asked if we could talk somewhere privately and we did. Finally I knew why he was upset. He had told me that he found out that he had a brain tumor which was malignant, which meant it had become cancerous. When he told me the news, his voice was quivering and tears were streaming down his cheeks.

I had never seen him like this before. I tried keeping in my tears and I tried not to show that I was hurt also. I was burning up inside and things were racing through my mind. I kept thinking, how could this have happened? A man who had everything made and had everything perfect. I kept it inside because I did not want him to see me upset.

I saw this brother slowly go down. He had to drop out of school at his last year because he began to lose his memory and he started to repeat himself over again. He did not have a chance at school without his memory. This brother was intelligent, but after, he became lost.

He was told that his fianceés family and her parents did not want their daughter to marry him, because he had no job and basically no future. This was hard for him, I remember he would cry to me about her and how he cared for her and how hopeless he felt.

Later, the brother had problems writing and his right eyesight was fading. The tumor was on the left side of his brain so it affected everything on his right. Because of his memory loss, the brother soon forgot suras and he even forgot how to pray. A year later, his right arm was paralyzed and his eyesight was taken away from him. It was the hardest thing for me to see. The brother I loved so much was going through so much. I began coming over everyday helping him recite suras.

When I was recited sura Fatiha to him and he was slowly repeating after me, I looked at him and I thought, this was the same brother who was so intelligent and was to finish school. This was the same brother who came from such a wealthy family. This was the same brother who talked for days about getting married and raising a family. This was the same brother who had everything. But now he can barely remember what I said to him ten minutes ago, he can’t get married, and now he is struggling to read Qur’an, he was not much of a practicing Muslim so it was harder for him to recite the Qur’an. This
man was now turning towards Allah, he dropped EVERYTHING and turned towards Allah. Allah gave him everything, and he could take everything away just as easily.

A month ago, I had received a call saying that the brother passed away and that his janaza is today. I washed his body with a couple of other brothers and I saw his lifeless body. He was buried and after that I returned home. The next day, I sat down wondering to myself about the power of Allah. My brother’s death made me realize that we forget what our purpose of being here is for: To serve Allah Ta'ala. You could have everything, but do you have anything that is important? I spent six years knowing this brother, and caring for him. I never once shed a tear when he was alive and not even when he passed away. But the day after his death, I did cry because I thought about the power of Allah Ta'ala. I thought about my brother. We always say that we will return to Allah, but we never really believe it. If we did, then we would struggle to read the Qur’an and pray to Allah like my brother did.

My brother had his eyesight taken away from him, his arm was paralyzed and his memory was lost, but he still got up every morning and he insisted and I repeat, insisted on reciting the Qur’an. But we are able, but we still do not struggle to read the Qur’an. We do not really believe that we will return to Allah, or else we would struggle for Allah Ta'ala.

My brother had love for materialistic objects, but when death approached him, those things were no use to him because he knew those things were not going to lead him to Jannah without his Iman. \*Allah can give and take things easily whenever and wherever.\* I love my brother and I pray that Allah will accept him, and I humbly request that prayer be made for him. I do pray that you have a true belief of Allah Ta'ala and our return to Him because if you do have this fear, you will struggle for your Islam to the best of your ability before you can say it is too late.

Let’s explore eight benefits of green tea for skin health and discover how to incorporate this health-promoting drink into your daily beauty routine.

# What is green tea?

[Green tea](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-amazing-health-benefits-of-green-tea) is made from the fresh tea leaves of the *Camellia sinensis* plant. Unoxidized green tea leaves contain high concentrations of catechins, a type of polyphenol with natural antioxidant capacities.

One of the most extensively studied green tea polyphenols is epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), known for its powerful antioxidant properties. 

In comparison, black tea, which is derived from the same plant as green tea, undergoes a different processing method during which the leaves are fully oxidized. This oxidation process alters polyphenol concentrations, resulting in significantly lower EGCG levels but higher tannin content. 

[Research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/910744/#:~:text=Consumption%20of%20food%20high%20in,ultraviolet%20absorption%20profiles%20at%20intervals.) published in *The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition* has found that consuming tannic acid can inhibit the absorption of essential nutrients, including thiamine, also known as vitamin B1, which can lead to thiamine deficiency.

Therefore, due to its delicate processing, green tea is considered more nutritious than black tea and is often the focus of scientific research for its wide variety of potential health benefits and wellness applications.

# 8 skin benefits of green tea

Green tea has been enjoyed for centuries, and many traditional wellness practices incorporate this soothing beverage for its natural compounds and supportive properties. 

Here are eight impressive benefits of green tea for skin health.

# 1. Reduces skin inflammation

For those struggling with [acne vulgaris](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-best-remedy-for-hormonal-cystic-acne), rosacea, and other inflammatory skin disorders, regularly drinking green tea may offer a natural solution to support skin health, especially when paired with a nutritious diet. 

[Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6930595/) published in *Molecules* found that the abundance of polyphenols in green tea possesses anti-inflammatory properties, which can help reduce skin redness, irritation, and swelling.

Green tea’s natural nutrient profile can help soothe irritated skin, making it a potentially beneficial therapeutic tool for managing several inflammatory skin conditions.

# 2. Protects against sun damage

Photoaging refers to the aging of the skin due to prolonged exposure to solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation. This can manifest in various skin issues, including wrinkling, loss of elasticity, and changes in pigmentation.

A recent [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9370301/#B37-nutrients-14-03149) published in *Nutrients* reports that EGCG, a key antioxidant in green tea, shows promising regenerative properties that may help counteract UV-induced damage.

# 3. Promotes autophagy

Green tea polyphenols have been shown to stimulate a crucial biological process known as autophagy. 

[Autophagy](https://www.drberg.com/blog/enhance-autophagy-with-coffee-and-herbs) is the body’s process of cleaning out and recycling old and damaged cells to regenerate newer, healthier cells. 

*“Autophagy is a fascinating repair mechanism that helps reduce inflammation, extends cellular lifespan, and has anti-aging properties,”* explains Dr. Berg.

Autophagy regulates the process of recycling old cells, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity and regeneration of skin cells, thereby contributing to the appearance of a radiant complexion.

# 4. Helps manage oily skin

Another important attribute of green tea polyphenols is their natural antimicrobial properties, which may help protect the skin from bacterial and [fungal infections](https://www.drberg.com/blog/cure-toenail-fungus-for-less-than-2-00-dr-berg).

[Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5384166/) published in *Antioxidants* showed that the combination of the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects of green tea polyphenols can support the management of both oily skin and acne. 

Both drinking green tea and applying it topically have been shown to help reduce the production of sebum, which contains the natural oils produced by the skin’s sebaceous glands.

# 5. May slow premature skin aging

Green tea may offer promising skin-rejuvenating and anti-inflammatory properties.

A [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29316635/) published in the *International Journal of Molecular Sciences* highlights green tea’s effectiveness in supporting hydration of the skin and retaining moisture, which is pivotal in slowing skin aging.

Additionally, green tea’s potential to combat free radicals may help reduce sun-related skin damage, offering a natural solution to prevent early signs of aging.

# 6. Reduces the appearance of cellulite

Incorporating green tea into your health and wellness routine may support the reduction of cellulite.

Its benefits for cellulite management are attributed to the metabolic effects of green tea’s caffeine and catechin concentrations, which have been found to promote [fat burning](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-7-symptoms-that-prove-you-are-in-fat-burning) and metabolic health, linked to a lower risk of cellulite.

# 7. Offers collagen support

Collagen provides structure, strength, and elasticity for the skin. As we age, collagen production decreases, resulting in common signs of aging, including wrinkles, fine lines, and a loss of skin elasticity. 

The antioxidant properties of green tea extract have been found to reduce collagen breakdown while promoting collagen crosslinking, which is crucial for maintaining structural integrity and skin resilience.

As a result, green tea intake can provide collagen support and support the skin’s suppleness and elasticity, thereby helping prevent the formation of wrinkles.

# 8. May decrease skin cancer risk

Certain polyphenols in green tea have been linked to potential anti-cancer properties.

A key factor in the onset of skin cancer is attributed to UV radiation damage to skin cell DNA. This damage can interfere with normal skin cell functions and potentially lead to mutations and, in the long term, skin cancer.

[Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3077767/) published in the *Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics* highlights that polyphenols, such as EGCG, stand out for their ability to support the skin’s natural DNA repair mechanisms. 

As a result, green tea polyphenols can help mitigate the effects of UV ray exposure, particularly the long-term risk of developing skin cancers such as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and potentially melanoma.

# How to use green tea for skin health

Green tea leaves offer a variety of beneficial plant compounds that can be incorporated into easy at-home skincare practices.

Here are several ways to incorporate green tea into your skin health routine.

# 1. Green tea face mask

You can make a simple green tea facial mask by mixing one tablespoon of green tea powder, commonly known as matcha, with one teaspoon of honey to form a paste. 

Honey is known for its moisturizing and antibacterial properties, which can complement the skin-health-promoting effects of green tea.

You can also add a teaspoon of aloe vera gel to the mix for an added boost of antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.

Apply the mask to your clean face, leave it on for 15 to 20 minutes, and rinse off with warm water. 

# 2. Green tea bags 

Saving used green tea bags can be a cost-effective and convenient way to enjoy the skin health benefits of green tea. 

Used green tea bags can be placed on the eyes to reduce puffiness and [dark circles](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-get-rid-of-puffy-eyes-and-dark-circles). However, ensure the tea bags are cool and moist before applying them to your eyes for about 10 to 15 minutes.

# 3. Drinking green tea

Regular consumption of green tea not only contributes to skin health but can also offer various benefits for overall well-being. 

Drinking between one and three cups of green tea daily can be an excellent way to incorporate this health-promoting beverage into your daily routine. 

However, remember to consume green tea in moderation to avoid potential side effects from excessive caffeine intake, such as headaches, dehydration, and restlessness. ",1,1770627881.0,DrEricBergDC,0,1.0,False

An 18-year-old aspiring artist from Barangay E. Lopez and one of the visual artists who painted murals for Silay City’s first exclusive Doll Museum, Balay Muñeka, at Casa A. Gamboa. His passion for art was inspired by his sister and late grandfather. Although he began drawing as a toddler, he started painting seriously in high school through art competitions.

A self-taught artist with no formal training or specialized art subjects, Vaughn initially struggled to navigate the evolving art field. He persevered by observing and learning from local Silaynon artists he considers mentors, including Ian Valladarez and Henry John Golez, during the Doll Museum project. With their guidance, he began participating in art exhibitions across the region.

He primarily paints realistic animals, still lives, and draws face portraits, but his true specialty lies in creating works that blend elements of cubism, realism, expressionism, and surrealism. Vaughn admits he wasn’t sure what genre his paintings belonged to, so he asked fellow artists for their opinion. They all agreed that his work appears to be a fusion of the four genres. Embracing the creative freedom that the art world offers, Vaughn decided to name his unique style ‘stylized cubism.’

He also show his passion for the natural world and literature by posting the poems he wrote, and animals and plants he encountered. He started loving literature when he was grade 11 senior high school, he was 17 when he started writing poems, but he was already amused by the natural world back when he was a toddler. This trait of his is shown in his paintings too, often putting a touch of realistic plants and animals and poetic symbolisms.

He shouldn’t be there, but he’s there, his wife didn’t tell me. His wife lives in my childhood house/his house 10 min from the facility and i live in an apartment with frozen pipes and minimal heat 2.5 hrs of transit away. I’d travel through fire to him, it doesn’t matter, but it’s just brutal.

I cant ask any other family for support because they’d disown me if they knew i was doing this. He never did anything to me, i was forced into estrangement as a kid by my mom. I’m his only advocate and source of sanity besides his wife who he maintains also wishes he could go home.

When i finally tracked down some answers through my uncle and contacted her she tried to scold me about my mom, told me my dad never asked about me anymore, that maybe i could see him sometime wjth her son, that the aids thought it would be too confusing if i went, that she hadn’t heard from me in a long time (i had sent several emails asking about him that she ignored). I said ok thank you, hung up, and left at 5 am the next morning to go there without permission. He was so happy t see me. He’s way more lucid than i was led to believe. I’ve been showing up ever since for the last 3 months, sometimes i get a hotel room out there, i tried to meet guys to maybe crash with them, but it didn’t work.

My best friend of 15 years vanished when this began, the aids gossip about “the estranged daughter”, the wife shows up and leaves to “go home and nap” in my childhood home, i stay with him till night time where he starts to cry because the aids are rough with him and he doesn’t want to share a room with a stranger and he just wants to go home. He tells me i can stay in my old room but he doesn’t know she hates me.

I walk along the freezing highway because i don’t have a car, i take the 3 hour journey back home into my cold apartment, and get ready to do it again tomorrow.

It seems intentional by “the universe” that this is a period of time that seems destined for me to not have a single person to hold me, listen to me, or help. I cant afford to move there, and i can’t afford not to.

She talks about how her son bought a 600k house states away. She tells me he left his bed in my old room for when he visits, so it’s full. She sent me a picture of her daughter curled up in a chair in my old living room, where I used to sit with my dad, on christmas. I opened the text while i was walking around alone at night the town over on my way to an air bnb.

I try not to dwell on it but it would be such a different world to have a supportive partner. Even to drive me. I’m so alone, and I can take it, I’m doing it, but fuck. It’s so frustrating to not have the money and resources to make this better for me and for him. I will finish school and make more money but that will still take months. He calls it his “incarceration”.

Vaughn Fennel Loredo Gacias 

An 18-year-old aspiring artist from Barangay E. Lopez and one of the visual artists who painted murals for Silay City’s first exclusive Doll Museum, Balay Muñeka, at Casa A. Gamboa. His passion for art was inspired by his sister and late grandfather. Although he began drawing as a toddler, he started painting seriously in high school through art competitions.

A self-taught artist with no formal training or specialized art subjects, Vaughn initially struggled to navigate the evolving art field. He persevered by observing and learning from local Silaynon artists he considers mentors, including Ian Valladarez and Henry John Golez, during the Doll Museum project. With their guidance, he began participating in art exhibitions across the region.

He primarily paints realistic animals, still lives, and draws face portraits, but his true specialty lies in creating works that blend elements of cubism, realism, expressionism, and surrealism. Vaughn admits he wasn’t sure what genre his paintings belonged to, so he asked fellow artists for their opinion. They all agreed that his work appears to be a fusion of the four genres. Embracing the creative freedom that the art world offers, Vaughn decided to name his unique style ‘stylized cubism.’

He also show his passion for the natural world and literature by posting the poems he wrote, and animals and plants he encountered. He started loving literature when he was grade 11 senior high school, he was 17 when he started writing poems, but he was already amused by the natural world back when he was a toddler. This trait of his is shown in his paintings too, often putting a touch of realistic plants and animals and poetic symbolisms.

The subject is time. 

I’m reasonably familiar with Einsteins field equations, and statistics and thermodynamics. 

I look at the thermodynamical view of time - the low entropy states are less probable than high entropy etc etc  so the arrow of time is what it is, and I look at the math and say “cool, makes sense”. 

Then I look at GR and I see spacetime and geodesics in curved spacetime etc etc. Again I look at the math and say “cool, makes sense”..

Though these views seem somewhat in contrast with each other. The thermodynamic one is about paths in vector spaces determined by a state probability. GR classical approach is to say “time is”. 

Maybe they aren’t but it’s morning and I haven’t had my coffee yet.

Anyone or any work to reconcile the two? There’s plenty of physicists way smarter than me who subscribe to both. 

Just curious if anyone has ideas or references.",1,1770627665.0,AskPhysics,4,0.66,False

😭 I can have ice cream just fine but I guess milk powder is too much? I may be both gluten AND lactose intolerant now. How likely is this?

Also I don’t have loose bowels. Just horrible pain and gas!

(Btw my organs are fine I had countless labs and scans in the last three years so my galbladder, liver, kidneys, are fine and my endoscopy and colonoscopy found nothing so…)

Even though the complete build weighs in at 7.8kg, it feels incredibly nimble and playful, and the handling is just right. The looks are clean too: a white frame with black components keeps it simple, without any fussy details (aside from the wheelset and crankset, most parts were swapped over from my road bike, so it’s definitely a budget-friendly build).

I bought a 54t Zen chainring, but my chain isn’t long enough to fit it yet, so I’m just running the one that came with the crankset for now.

Riding fixed gear really is a different experience. Even though this bike didn’t cost much, it brings me more joy than any other bike I’ve owned—the more I ride it, the more I love it.
