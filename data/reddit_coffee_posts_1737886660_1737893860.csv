I developed feelings and met up for coffee a week after. It was only after this my suspicions regarding her having someone began to grow. Until I found out that yes, she has someone. And I say I had to find out because she's NEVER mentioned it to me. She's never mentioned having a guy even though we've hung out and have talked for 6+ months. Isn't that odd?

So again, over the next several months we talked a lot, and finally began to hang out a bit in November. We saw a movie at a dine-in theater, went to a park, had coffee 2 times and now just saw her at an event. Thankfully I mentally prepared myself that her fiance might be there. (Long distance, he visits ever so often) And I was right. 

And I was soooo uncomfortable. I didnt know how to approach her. Cause I don't know if he knows about me. And I dont know if she wanted me to meet him. So I stood my ground on one side of the event, and she walked across on her own to greet me and hug me. We talked a bit, took a photo with someone else and then we departed. I didnt want to make her or him feel any more odd about me. But idk, did I make things look worse by avoiding her in a way? Cause I greeted everyone else's partner except hers. She could've brought him over to greet me but he stood back alone. 

Yes, I know. I'm trying my hardest to detach and focus on being good friends, cause we do make good friends. I want to be more and I've tried to be more but maybe she's just been nice to me and wants to keep her private life private, right?

Edit: I also wanted to add i gave her birthday and Christmas gifts over the holidays and well, they were pretty great gifts. Not too much, but very meaningful things. She does like me for sure as a friend, we have plans to work together again and has even agreed she's down to hang out with me on more exclusive date-like outings.

I made a note to get some mayo the next time I went shopping when I got paid.

I wondered if at first I had missed it, but this was a huge bottle of Hellman's mayonnaise which was located right in front of me. The fridge had been opened numerous times so I could get the milk out for coffee and I definitely would've spotted it before.

I mentioned it to my mum and she was as stunned as I was as she hadn't been out either and she had been in the fridge as well numerous times.

I worked a fulltime job in marketing and I pay for 95% of our Bills. My GF has a minor 3-4 hour per day job in the Media industry and doesn't earn the same I do. I do the majority of the cleaning with her vacuuming. I always cook breakfast, lunch, and dinner for us. I always make us coffee/tea. I always do the dishes and grocery shopping. I wake up at 4am just to make sure my GF is awake and ready to get to her job (she works radio morning shift hours). 

My partner suffers with ADHD and she just isn't very good at handling it. She went to a cheaper form of Ritalin because she couldn't afford the premium meds and I feel like since she went on those meds her ADHD has become worse. Before we dated, she would go out, be social, cook for herself, clean, drive herself to work, etc. But since we've been dating, she's lost all of those independent responsibilities. We've been together for 2 years now. 

She will spend 3-4 hours on the floor to de-compress in the afternoons, then complain that she doesn't have enough time to clean or do her laundry or finish her work. Forget about Sex. My libido is quite high since I exercise and gym frequently and I always have to initiate. We may do it 1-2 times a month and that's on a good time. we cannot even schedule it because when the time comes shes too tired or not feeling well. 

I feel like I'm carrying our relationship and I feel like hopeless. My mother recently got the news that her cancer has come back and I'm trying to keep it together and make sure my routine and responsibilities don't get interrupted. 

My partner tells me to let her know if I need help and when I asked for help she complains and doesn't want to do it and accuses me of being rude or mean to her. 

I love her, and I really do and I always have a good time with her and all her friends love me and my friends love her, but living with her, it's like living with a fucking ferral goblin. She wears the same old ""house clothes"" for weeks and our room is 80% always dirty with clothes or make up or bags. 

I need some advice on what I can do? what can I do better? I want to be better but I also feel like my GF needs to also be better and start acting like an adult.

There, I connected with someone living in Gurgaon, and we planned to meet for drinks. I assumed we’d go to a bar, but he invited me to his place instead, saying it was “better and cozy.” Curious and amused, I agreed.

When I reached his location, I was stunned. His house was a luxurious villa with every amenity you could imagine—a private elevator, recliners, and even a jacuzzi. He welcomed me warmly, and we shared drinks, snacks, and stories about travel and life.

He was intriguing but had a tendency to dominate the conversation, constantly flaunting his achievements, which I found both impressive and a bit over the top. His perspective on life and relationships was unconventional—focused on freedom, independence, and avoiding emotional ties.

The night took an unexpected turn when he made a move on me, which I politely but firmly declined. The situation became awkward, but he apologized, and we moved on.

The next morning, over coffee, we talked about spirituality, tech innovations in his house, and random musings about life. Despite the odd moments, it was a memorable experience—a mix of luxury, eccentricity, and a dash of unpredictability that left me with a story to tell.

Lesson Learned:

Couchsurfing is a great platform to meet new people and experience different perspectives, but it’s important to set clear boundaries and trust your instincts. Always prioritize your safety and be prepared for the unexpected when meeting strangers.

Feedback for Couchsurfing:

The app has immense potential to connect people from all walks of life, but adding features to verify profiles more thoroughly or encourage transparency about intentions could make it safer and more comfortable for users.

I am still coming to terms with the diagnosis after decades of telling myself excuses of stress, overworking, wondering if I’m just depressed, calling sleep my “super power,” etc 

Thus far I’ve had four prior authorization denials for treatment of IH. I am currently on birth control (there goes multiple medications due to interactions… modafinil, armodafinil, Wakix) but even more important to me, I do hope to try for a family in the next couple years, and many of these medications have limited data in pregnancy and suggest birth defect risk, including the modafinils, Wakix, Sunosi. Xywave is not on my insurance’s formulary, but I am weary of trying needing to be able to be up at night with a little one. Being a pharmacist helps me find information, but doesn’t help me get treatment any faster. 

How did you navigate motherhood with IH? I’ve had a lot of fear about it — still dozing off while holding my niece in the morning after a full night’s sleep while she eats. 

Any non-drug tips? My family has always wondered why I don’t just drink coffee. I don’t think caffeine does much for me but make me a bit sick. I am trying to eat well, and exercise regularly.

Here’s to hoping for a more awake and present me this year. Thank you. ",1,1737891832.0,idiopathichypersomnia,1,1.0,False

I started with a new dentist 16 months ago, no previous dental problems. He diagnosed 9 cavities in this time, only 2 of which I've seen myself. He constantly accuses me of not flossing and having a poor diet, neither of which are true, and has told me to stop snacking all together. I have done everything as suggested, I started using a high fluoride toothpaste as prescribed. He took xrays at a check up and told me I had reversible mild decay between some teeth, and looked at the SAME xrays at an appointment for a filling 2 months later and told me the decay was non reversible and due to my diet. For context, my diet has always been healthy and heavy with vegetables, and I drink tea and coffee with no sugar or creamer in moderation (which I drink within 10 minutes), soda maybe once a month when I go out to eat. I've also had a broken composite filling 3 months after it was applied, it happened from daily flossing using the c-shaped method. He's never offered any further advice or alternative treatment or explanation. I feel so stressed and I'm trying to get a second opinion but I've developed a bit of a phobia I'm trying to fight, I've had OCD for years and this is so triggering. He's also been unprofessional in other ways such as stopping drilling to take a phone call, outright saying I'm not telling the truth, and even saying ""eating a cashew nut"" between meals is causing my teeth to be bathed in acid and that's why my teeth are decaying. I accept I had 2 cavities but my teeth are kinda crowded and both in places that were tight. Please tell me I'm justified in changing dentist or seeking a second opinion.

As of this past Tuesday, I have a confirmed 3cm gallstone. The confirmation came due to me taking doxycycline on an empty stomach the Sunday prior and being in pain with nausea for 2+ hours.

I've been pretty much surviving on Atkins shakes, water, some coffee, and random healthy dinners (salmon with broccoli and carrots/sandwiches or wraps/ etc). 

Could the heartburn, nausea, and fatigue be causing this? I am also in process of fighting a small uti and have been taking an antibiotic 2x a day for the past 2 days, but the nausea and heartburn were prior to this.

We chat all the time, Snapchats, memes, Instagram reels, and just get along really well. We’re in group chats together, and we pretty much spend our whole workday together. We don’t hang out outside of work, but we get a couple coffees a day and maybe the odd walk/run at lunch but that’s the only time I see him 1 on 1.  

Also I don’t have feelings for my co worker and I’ve never thought of him in that way. My bf says he definitely likes me but i don’t see it. 

I know my boyfriend gets frustrated about it, and I guess I can kind of see why. He’s mentioned it before, and I know he gets a little jealous of the time I spend with this guy. The thing is, he and I have some of the best conversations about work and just life, and he’s helped me with so much work stuff and exams, so I guess I rely on him a lot. 

The other day, my boyfriend and I fought, and I told my work friend about it, not in a way that was anything out of the ordinary, just like venting. But when my boyfriend asked if I’d told anyone, I lied and said I hadn’t, but then later admitted it was him. He got mad about the lie, and I get it—especially since I didn't want him to feel more insecure than he already does. But to be honest, I just wanted a guy’s perspective on the fight since my co worker has a more neutral stance.

I love my boyfriend and we have been going out for over 2 years, we have been on trips together and we both see a future together, but sometimes the connection I have with my co-worker feels so easy and natural. There’s no pressure or expectation like I sometimes feel with my boyfriend. And I know that sounds bad, but it’s not that I’m choosing him over my boyfriend. It’s just that sometimes, my boyfriend seems so needy, and I feel like I’m always having to give him my attention when I also need my own space. With my co-worker, it’s just light and fun—we joke, we talk, and it’s like a break from all the heaviness.

I don’t want my boyfriend to feel like I’m pulling away, but I also don’t want to feel suffocated. Sometimes, it feels like I’m not meeting all of his needs, and I worry about that. I guess the dynamic with my co-worker is just different, and it makes me wonder if it’s crossing a line, even though I don’t have feelings for him. I know that doesn’t make my boyfriend’s worries go away, and I don’t want him to feel like I’m prioritizing anyone else. But at the same time, I need balance too, and it’s hard to find that sometimes.
I really don’t want to hurt my boyfriend or lose him, but I’m scared that my bond with my co-worker might make him feel like I’m not emotionally available for him. I guess I just don’t know where to draw the line between friendship and something that might feel too close for comfort.

1iace6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1iace6r/where_no_ppp/,Where? No ppp,"Everyone knows that the cold, aloof CEO's gentlest side belongs only to me. 
Even if I sometimes lost my temper with him, he always gave me unconditional favor.
Until that night, he gave me a good night kiss after coming home from working overtime.
I suddenly noticed something unusual about him: he shaved before going to bed.

""Seriously? You're worked up about him shaving?"" my best friend Lucy let out an exasperated laugh. ""Since when is that a crime?""

""He never shaves at night,"" I said quietly.

""Oh come on, maybe he had a dinner meeting!""

I shook my head firmly.

""Lucy, you know Nathan. Home by seven, lights out by eleven - the man runs like clockwork. He hasn't done a business dinner in years.""

""Right, because he's too busy being madly in love with you,"" Lucy countered, her expression softening. ""Emma, please tell me you're not actually worried about this?""

I caught myself and managed a small laugh.

""Of course not.""

As if on cue, my phone lit up with Nathan's call.

""Sweetheart, Jenny mentioned you hardly touched your lunch. I've had Mark pick up some of your favorites from Bella's Kitchen. Get some food in you, take a little walk before your nap - and hey, I grabbed us tickets to that new Broadway show you've been wanting to see.""

His voice carried that gentle warmth he reserved just for me, like someone speaking to their most precious person in the world.

Lucy was listening in, shaking her head in disbelief.

""God, if anyone at Pierce & Associates could hear their ice-cold CEO right now...""

I couldn't blame her amazement. The Nathan Pierce that everyone else knew was all sharp suits and sharper decisions, the ruthless Wall Street legend who'd built an empire before forty. Sure, people knew he was devoted to his wife - but they had no idea just how deep that devotion ran.

We'd been together for ten years, married for five, and this tender, attentive version of Nathan had always been mine alone. He could recite my coffee order in his sleep, knew exactly which designer's new collection would catch my eye, could tell from a single text if I was having a rough day...

Last summer, I stormed out after a fight about his overprotective streak. Spent the night at The Plaza. When I came home the next morning, I found him on our living room couch, still in yesterday's suit, looking like he'd aged years overnight. The moment he saw me, he crossed the room in three strides and pulled me close, his voice breaking: ""I'm so sorry, baby. Never again.""

Then there was that weekend at the Hamptons last year. Our vacation villa caught fire while he was out grabbing my favorite ice cream. He tried to charge into the building - it took three security guards and the local firefighters to hold him back. Only when he heard me screaming his name from the pool house did he stop fighting them, his designer suit singed and smoking.

He still has a scar above his eyebrow from that night. Every time I see it, my heart twists, but he just gives me that soft smile and says, ""My battle scar from being Emma Pierce's hero.""

That's the thing about Nathan's love for me. It's my constant, my true north - more reliable than gravity itself.

And God knows I love him just as fiercely.

Which is exactly why something as small as him shaving before bed...

I noticed it instantly.

They say Cancers are born worriers. Mix that with my mom's perfectionist DNA, and you've got someone who sees a red flag in every tiny change to routine.

Normally when a guy shaves at night, he's heading to a business dinner. But Nathan? He's got his routine down to a science - dinner at one of his regular spots, then straight home. No cocktail hours, no networking events, nothing.

So what could possibly make Manhattan's most powerful CEO break his golden rule? Was there some crisis at Pierce & Associates he was shielding me from?

I had to see for myself. If everything was fine, great. If not, we'd face it together.

I called Sarah. We'd been roommates all through Harvard, and now she was CFO at Pierce & Associates. Back when her family lost everything in the 2008 crash, I'd helped her get back on her feet and convinced Nathan to give her a shot at the firm.

She practically sprinted across the marble lobby when she saw me.

""Emma!"" She pulled me into a hug before whisking me toward the private elevator. ""You need to visit more often! The whole office lights up when you're here. Even Nathan's death glare takes a vacation.""

I couldn't help but smile. ""Everything okay around here lately?""

""Better than okay - huge news!""

""What?"" My stomach dropped.

""We doubled our profits! Everyone's getting massive bonuses!"" Sarah's whole face lit up. That's what I've always loved about her - life knocked her down hard, but she never lost that sparkle.

Nathan was stuck in meetings, so Sarah walked me to his corner office. As we passed the executive floor, I noticed a cluster of unfamiliar faces - all young, female, and looking like they'd stepped off a magazine cover.

A nasty little thought crept in: Was this why he'd suddenly started caring about evening grooming?

I immediately felt sick at myself. This was Nathan Pierce, for God's sake. The same man who'd hosted the Miss Manhattan pageant at our venue and spent the whole evening answering work emails in his office.

""You okay? You've got that look,"" Sarah nudged me.

I bit my lip. ""New assistants?""

""What? Oh - the PR team. Business is booming, so Nathan set up a dedicated external relations department. His idea, actually - said it was the only way to keep his promise about being home for dinner every night.""

She gave me that knowing look. ""Emma Pierce, you were literally on Vanity Fair's '30 Under 30' list. Are you seriously worried about the PR girls?""

""I know, I know, I'm being ridiculous,"" I laughed weakly.

Sarah squeezed my arm. ""Your overthinking is going to give you premature wrinkles. Relax - they handle client events. Nathan barely knows their names.""

After she left, I sank into Nathan's chair, staring at the gallery of our photos on his desk. Photos from our vineyard wedding, our Amalfi Coast anniversary, casual shots of me laughing in Central Park...

So the company was thriving. No other woman. Maybe he just got a fancy new electric razor from his Birchbox. Maybe he just felt like it.

Lucy and Sarah kept telling me if I hadn't married someone as steady as Nathan, my anxiety would've landed me in therapy years ago.

Then came a soft knock.

A woman entered, head slightly bowed, setting down a cup of artisan tea with picture-perfect precision.

""Mrs. Pierce, please don't hesitate if you need anything else.""

My blood ran cold.

Claire Morrison. Nathan's executive assistant.

I hadn't expected to see her.

She was still here.

A few years ago, Nathan came home looking like he'd seen a ghost. I knew something was wrong the moment he walked through our apartment door.

He sat on our Italian leather sofa for what felt like hours before he finally spoke. He'd run into the family of the drunk driver who killed his parents.

The accident happened when Nathan was at Harvard. His parents were stopped at a red light on the Mass Pike when a drunk driver plowed into them at full speed. All three died instantly.

Claire Morrison was that driver's daughter.

Nathan had discovered this three months after his HR team hired her as his executive assistant.

I'd never seen him so shaken - his hands trembling, eyes bloodshot. ""Emma, I can't... every time I see her, all I can think about is that night. Sometimes I just want to..."" His voice cracked. This was Nathan Pierce - the man who could make or break companies without blinking - completely undone.

I pulled him close, running my fingers through his hair. ""Hey, it's okay. You don't have to handle this alone. You can have HR transfer her, give her a great recommendation.""

That was the first time I'd ever seen the ruthless CEO of Pierce & Associates break down like a lost child, holding onto me like I was his anchor to reality.

When I carefully broached the subject a few weeks later, he seemed back to his usual composed self.

""I had her moved to Operations on a different floor.""

""Why keep her at all? Are you sure you're okay with this?""

His expression was surprisingly peaceful. ""You were right - I can't let the past control me forever. Maybe this is my chance to grow beyond it. I'm fine, really.""

After that, during my occasional office visits, Claire vanished from sight. Nathan never mentioned her again. I thought he'd finally found his peace with it.

Until today, when she walked into his corner office.

""I thought Melissa was your assistant now?""

Claire gave that nervous smile she'd perfected. ""She's on maternity leave. A few of us from Operations are rotating coverage.""

""That must be quite the adjustment,"" I said diplomatically.

Claire Morrison wasn't exactly Manhattan executive material. Small-boned, almost delicate, with plain features and off-the-rack clothes. She had this permanent deer-in-headlights look - like someone who spent their life trying not to be noticed.

She dipped her head slightly. ""Mrs. Pierce, I should get back to the front desk.""

As she turned, I caught sight of something on her neck - several distinctive red marks.

Unmistakably hickeys.

Nathan returned from his board meeting looking every inch the power player in his bespoke Tom Ford suit.

He leaned against the doorframe of his office, just watching me with that smile that still made my heart skip. ""Finally decided to grace Pierce & Associates with your presence?""

I walked over and slipped into his arms. ""Maybe I should visit more often. Your entire staff lights up when I'm here.""

He tweaked my nose playfully. ""They better not light up too much.""

I chose my next words carefully. ""Claire brought me coffee earlier.""

He stilled for a moment before managing a quiet ""Mm.""

""She's filling in as your assistant. Nathan, you don't have to explain - I know you've worked through this.""

I looked up at him. ""Mom always said you had incredible resilience. Look at you now - running this empire, handling everything so perfectly. She knew exactly what you'd become.""

His dark eyes held mine for a long moment before he bent to brush his lips against my forehead.

""Emma,"" he murmured against my skin, ""that's all because of you.""

A week later.

After spending the morning at Christie's fall preview, I decided to surprise Nathan with macarons from Ladurée. The front desk security guard - Mike, I think - gave me his usual warm smile as I signed in. ""Want me to let Mr. Pierce know you're here, Mrs. Pierce?"" I shook my head with a conspiratorial wink. ""Let's make it a surprise.""

When I reached the top floor, I tapped on the heavy oak door of his corner office. Nathan's boardroom voice cut through: ""I specifically said no interruptions.""

""Even for your wife?""

Beep. The security lock clicked open.

The floor-to-ceiling windows were dimmed to their darkest setting, turning the spectacular Manhattan view into a muted backdrop. Nathan sat behind his massive Restoration Hardware desk, his expression softening when he saw me.

""This is unexpected.""

I gave him a playful pout. ""Brought you something sweet. Though you weren't very sweet just now.""

""Ten-minute break,"" he spoke into his MacBook before pulling out his AirPod Pro. He massaged his temples, looking exhausted. ""Sorry, angel. Quarterly board meeting. Didn't realize it was you.""

""Still live?"" I whispered.

""Mhm. Just muted myself.""

That smile I fell in love with spread across his face. ""But I never pass up treats from Mrs. Pierce.""

With his webcam still running, I stayed by the visitor chairs. ""Well then, let me pamper my overworked CEO.""

I opened the signature mint-green box and lifted a rose raspberry macaron to his lips.

He leaned forward with that boyish grin I adored, but suddenly tensed, a sound catching in his throat.

""Nathan?"" I held the macaron mid-air, concern creeping in.

He blinked hard, took the macaron, and after a moment spoke in a strained voice: ""Just fatigue. These back-to-back meetings...""

""I should go. Let you catch your breath before you dive back in.""

His lips pressed together apologetically, voice slightly raspy. ""Text me next time - I'll block off my afternoon.""

As I headed out, I glanced back. Nathan was reclining in his Herman Miller, head tilted back, the filtered sunlight casting shadows across his Tom Ford suit as his ch//est rose and fell.

By the private elevator bank, something felt off. I turned back.

Just past the executive assistants' area, I saw his door open.

A figure slipped out.

When she glanced around furtively, I saw her face clearly.

Claire Morrison.

Still in her Ann Taylor basics and minimal Sephora makeup, still radiating that carefully cultivated mousy demeanor.

The only thing out of place was her MAC Russian Red lipstick - subtly smeared at the corners.

I stood frozen.

From leaving his office to the elevator and back - barely sixty seconds had passed.

When had Claire entered?

During that brief minute?

Or—

My eyes went to Nathan's oversized Restoration Hardware desk.

Massive enough.

Massive enough to conceal someone underneath.

At five sharp, I watched Claire Morrison exit Pierce Tower's executive garage. Something felt off seeing such a petite woman climb into a fully loaded Jeep Grand Cherokee L Summit Reserve.

I kept my Porsche Cayenne GTS at a discreet distance, trailing her fifteen minutes north to The Estates at Greenwich Cove - one of those ultra-private communities where homes start at eight figures. Not exactly the neighborhood you'd expect for someone in Operations.

The guard at the limestone gatehouse barely glanced at my Cayenne's diplomatic plates before waving me through. I fed him some line about visiting a friend from the country club.

I parked a few houses down from where her Jeep sat in a heated circular driveway. The whole time, I kept asking myself what the he//ll I was doing. This wasn't me - following people, playing amateur detective.

Maybe it was those telltale marks on her neck. Maybe it was that smudged MAC Russian Red.

Either way, my anxiety was in the driver's seat now.

Just as I was about to put this ridiculous stalking expedition behind me, another car glided into view.

A car I'd recognize anywhere.

Nathan's Rolls-Royce Cullinan Black Badge.

My blood froze. My Cartier watch ticked off the seconds as I sat there, paralyzed.

The Rolls idled silently in front of Claire's designer farmhouse.

No movement.

With trembling fingers, I pulled up Nathan's contact.

He answered instantly, his voice warm through my AirPods.

""Hey beautiful, everything okay?""

Fighting to keep my voice steady: ""Still at the office? You weren't feeling great earlier - maybe come home?""

A soft chuckle. ""Just left actually. Last-minute thing with Senator Mitchell about that Hudson Yards project. Needed someone from Operations for the details.""

""Who'd you bring?"" My voice sounded distant to my own ears.

""Claire Morrison. She knows the numbers inside out.""

Through my windshield, I watched Claire hurry out clutching a Smythson portfolio, sliding into Nathan's Rolls.

Nathan was still talking: ""Don't worry about earlier - just conference call fatigue. Claire just got in, we'll wrap with Mitchell by seven. I'll pick up dinner from Jean-Georges on my way home.""

After hanging up, I forced myself to breathe.

His tone was completely transparent. Nothing hidden.

Pure coincidence.

A senator's impromptu request. Claire being the numbers person. My ridiculous paranoid episode...

I watched the Rolls glide past the Newport-style fountain toward the main gates.

Starting my Cayenne, something made me pause.

When the Rolls exited...

The gates opened automatically. No pause for clearance.

Slowly, I turned back to Claire's house.

It was one of those modern farmhouse meets Hamptons designs that had taken over Greenwich - all clean lines and massive windows. The second-floor Restoration Hardware lanterns cast a soft glow through custom Fortuny drapes. The wraparound veranda showcased perfectly manicured topiaries from Winston Flowers.

I sat frozen behind my steering wheel.

Ten minutes later, I found myself at her front door.

A sleek Nest × Yale lock gleamed in the fading light.

Like someone else was controlling my fingers, I punched in a number.

960703 - my birthday.

Click.

The door unlocked.

For a moment, reality seemed to blur.

Like I was watching someone else's life through frosted glass.

I pinched myself. Hard.

Not dreaming.

Taking a breath, I pushed the door open—

And froze.

Instead of the cozy family home I'd expected, I walked into what looked like an exclusive private dining room. Crystal chandelier hung low, mahogany panels, oversized oil paintings, high-backed dining chairs...

I knew this room.

All those video calls with Nathan during his ""late meetings"" - this was the backdrop.

A laugh escaped my throat, sounding hollow in the silence.

My eyes drifted to the powder room door. Something familiar caught my eye.

The red cashmere scarf I'd spent weeks knitting for Nathan last Thanksgiving. I'd followed a YouTube tutorial, determined to make something by hand.

Now it hung from the toilet handle. A makeshift pull.

Upstairs, the master suite revealed an oversized bed - custom-made, clearly.

A La Perla negligee tossed carelessly across the pillows.

The walk-in closet held a collection of men's clothes: Tom Ford suits, Brioni shirts, silk pajamas. Nathan's exact style.

In the en-suite bathroom, his-and-hers everything: Aesop toiletries, Turkish cotton towels, an electric razor.

I picked up the razor.

Stubble still caught in the blades.

The silence pressed in.

Time seemed to slow, then stop entirely.

I stood frozen, unable to move, barely breathing.

Footsteps on the stairs. Voices drifting up.

""Sure you won't stay for dinner?""

Nathan's voice: ""Just a quick shower. Need to be home by seven.""

Panic seized me.

Not wanting to face what I knew was coming, I rushed to the balcony, pressing myself against the limestone wall.

But their reflection was perfect in the glass doors.

Nathan. Claire.

I hugged myself, trembling.

Nathan methodically removing his Burberry coat, Kiton suit, Patek Philippe watch.

Claire hovering nearby, voice soft: ""Stay later tonight?""

Nathan's expression remained blank as he continued undressing.

""You told her you had a meeting with the senator. This chance—""

""Know your place."" His voice cut like ice.

Claire bit her lip, then whispered:

""But earlier... you enjoyed it.""

Nathan's hands stilled on his shirt buttons.

He looked down at her, silent.

Her hands slid inside his shirt, moving lower.

""We were interrupted before... Why not finish what we started?""

The sounds that followed were unmistakable.

As their moans filled the air, the first snow of winter began to fall.

I stared upward, feeling disconnected, as if I were floating away into the grey sky.

I couldn't bring myself to confront them.

Couldn't bear to witness something that would sicken me for the rest of my life.

Couldn't even find the strength to leave.

Mom's last words echoed: I had inherited her sensitivity but not her decisive nature. Thank goodness Nathan was so steady, she'd said. He'd take care of me.

Mom knew me too well. And didn't know Nathan at all.

The snow fell softly, whitewashing the world.

Claire emerged in her silk negligee, looking satisfied.

Footsteps thundered up the stairs.

A nanny appeared with a little boy, about three years old.

""Mommy! Nanny brought Cooper home!""

Claire scooped him up, smiling.

The bedroom door opened. Nathan emerged freshly showered, dressed in identical clothes.

The little boy's eyes lit up:

""Daddy!""

Hi! Since ngayon nalang ulit ako nakadaan sa SM Aura and sakto nakita ko may Yardstick na din pala dito malapit sa SM Cinema, ni-try ko ung Sea Salt Latte (220 pesos) nila. May mga nabasa na ko na hindi maganda first impression nila pero ang masasabi ko lang ay… Same sis!! Nothing special rt. Idk if sakin lang pero wala talagang special sa drink na to. Ang labnaw, lasang tig 59++ pesos lang na coffee sa mga local stores.  Na try ko din ung popcorn coffee nila ba yon? Hahaha. Ayon medyo na bet ko siguro kasi first time ko maka taste ng coffee na lasang popcorn talaga? Hahahahaha. Anw this is just my opinion. Siguro soon ttry ko ibang drinks nila. Sabi din ng friend ko, madalas nag papa customize sila ng drink na wala sa menu. Sa isip ko pa nung tinikman ko ung coffee, considering the price sana nag SB na lang ako hahaha.

Good evening.

I know that the chances of you reading this is very low, tho I'm hoping it's not zero. One of your friends told me that you like me. Tbh, I think it would be better if I wasn't informed about it. I liked you before (2023), and you're starting to get my attention again last year. And it makes me really nervous. It's just that I can see you as someone who is out of my league. You're incredibly gorgeous, smart, friendly, and fun to talk to. And I'm just that quiet, serious-looking, career-oriented person at the corner of our office. I don't know if you still consider me as your happy crush until now, but if you do, please know that I feel the same towards you. I don't want to assume things based on how we bond inside and outside the office.

I enjoy talking to you, I feel like I can express myself freely towards you. And I hope that you feel the same way too, because I like listening to your random ""chikas"". 

You told me that you're always in the office if I wanted company, well I do enjoy your company. Maybe we can grab a cup of coffee at BGC after office (just the two of us)? Don't worry, I'll drive you home again. Anyway, I look forward to see your cutest smile whenever we walk past each other at the office. See you again next month, B.

You make me nervous and happy at the same time. 🫣

I answered: Why not? And he's like, well you have a point, but he continued to flirt with me despite me and his friend telling him several times that I'm not interested. Didn't feel too intimidating because it was afternoon and I was about to leave anyway, but yeah, I had to leave to make it stop, which was unfair and annoying.

Then, a few hours later I took an Uber. The driver does the usual bs, ""are you going out tonight?"" etc, I tell him I go to an Airbnb even though I didn't want to tell him. He goes ""Ooh, all by yourself?"" As I had already prepared for this question, I tell him that my ""boyfriend will join me later"". 

Urgh. This is also a rant but I'm looking for tips. Does anyone have some original answers I can give next time? What works best for you to get people to leave you alone?

I often times bring the conversations back to the bigger items: family goals, life goals, career/financial goals, religion talks, what we are looking for, etc... instead of being able to enjoy the conversation wherever the conversation leads.

I know this will get a ton of hate. I don't like myself as well right now.

INFO:

\-I've been married for a year, dating for about 5 years. We used to live together, but we are currently making it work long distance (different countries).

\-My friend and I have known each other for about 1/3 of my life. We started off as friends, and in the early days of our friendship we foolishly slept together once, but reverted back to friends. (This was all before I met my now husband.) We've become good friends since, always know about each others dating lives, major events and struggles. We live in different cities.

\-I have cheated on a previous partner once. I ended things without the partner finding out about the affair. I was very young back then and (thought I) learned my lesson.

\- My husband knows about me and my friend's history and all of my dating history (even the one where I've cheated). We communicate constantly and strive to be as open with each other as we can.

I think I've laid out as much relevant information without doxxing myself, so now, the event:

My friend booked a hotel in my city to visit me over the weekend. We haven't seen each other in ages, so we planned to hang out the whole day. I let my husband know in advance, he was fine with it and said he trusted me. My friend and I visited each other from time to time without it ending in complications, so there were no alarm bells blaring in my head. We've been alone together multiple times in each other's apartments. To me, at least up until last night, we were platonic.

So we met, had a good lunch. I had work that morning, so I left my work laptop in his hotel as it was heavy (it was closer than my apartment), and went out for coffee to catch up. I needed to check something urgent for work suddenly, so we headed to his hotel to grab my laptop.

After I was done, we ended up reminiscing about our 20's. He was going through a rough patch at the moment in his own relationship, and was looking back on simpler times. Then the topic lead to the early days of our friendship, and in retrospect, I should have known that that was us stepping into murky territories. It lead to us talking about the day we slept together... then he mentioned something about the timing being always off between us. I was stunned for a moment, as to me, that event was just a momentary lapse of judgement. We definitely had that sort of attraction back then, but I believed we both knew that it was not romantic, and it wasn't a kind of thing that would lead to something more serious.

The discussion got messy, and the room was suddenly filled with tension. We were just there, a few feet apart and not touching, but my mind wasn't thinking clearly and my heart was racing. We went back and forth from ""we want to"" then ""we shouldn't"" then ""we could"" then ""we can't"". I had a split second of self control, ended up saying I had to leave. At that point, I would say I 90% didn't want to go. I was walking, stopping every few steps, looking at pictures of me and my husband, thought about the life we built so far, and the plans we had. I called him (he was asleep), he asked how it went, I lied and said it went well (I eventually told him earlier today) and I was on my way home just looking for a cab. It took almost every inch of me to walk away. I was dangerously close to ruining what I had. Just a few changes in that situation (if we sat close to each other, or if we were intoxicated) and I probably would have been on a totally different dilemma.

I am angry and sad and hated how I left things. I feel like I am mourning a friendship. I knew what I would lose if I caved in would not be something I could emotionally recover from, and still, being the greedy AH that I am, I did not want to lose my friend either. I truly have only a few close ones, ones who know all the ugly parts of myself, and he is one of them. But above it all, I love my husband, and even though our lives are far from perfect, I want to live it with no one else but him.

It is messing with my head how easy it could have been to screw up my life with just one night. With a bit of clarity right now, wether or not my husband would've found out, it would have weighed on me forever. I would know. It took one night to disrupt the kind of partner I thought I was, and how weak I truly am. Besides the fact that my friend and I were BOTH in committed relationships, we've tested those murky waters when we were younger and we knew it DIDN'T WORK. We weren't even drunk. And yet I was so close to just... messing my whole life up.

And even if I know I made the right call in the end, my heart still breaks over the friendship I now think I lost. I know I could have lost a lot WORSE. Nothing happened, but it still feels like I took a hit and lost.",2,1737889742.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False
1iabtok,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaggiaclassic/comments/1iabtok/gaggia_classic_newbie/,Gaggia classic newbie.,"Hi everyone, I bought a classic anniversary edition (with the acrobat on it)  back in 2023 black Friday deals, I got it setup late november/early December last year 😳
I've watched so many coffee videos over the past 5/6 years, but doesn't seem to have made me any good at making espresso or steaming milk 😅

I have a couple of questions using the classic if you could help me, 

1. Even if I pull what seems to be a decent espresso, the top of the puck seems a little wet (to me, maybe it's normal), it tends to knock out OK, not super soupy. 
I should take a picture next time I pull a shot and add it. The solenoid flush seems to be working OK. 

2. I notice some dripping from the group head, I. E. After pulling a shot today, while steaming the milk some drops started falling from the group. The other day after pulling a shot and removing the portafilter it was dripping for a while, not sure if this is residual water or if something could be loose/seal off? Does seem to be coming from the screen not out of the he side or anything.

Are these things normal? 

Thanks. I'll take a picture of my set up, maybe later today, my kitchen light went on the blink last night so need a new tube bulb. 

Thanks

As the title says, I am looking for a casual chat partner to make my days stress-free. Who doesn't want a bit of dopamine in the day? It's easier said than done, to be honest, but if you are here, hopefully, we will connect.

I am 39, a working professional who landed on Reddit by chance and just got hooked on it, as most of us do, due to wonderful communities and subs. I am married and father to a wonderful daughter whom I love to the moon and back.

So, what am I seeking here? That's a good question, and to be honest, I am just trying to explore and discover myself. Yes, at this age, I am. I have been working rigorously for the last 15 years nonstop and have given my all to my family and running finances, but in the last couple of years it has been a landslide spiral down in my personal space, so I decided that I should pay a bit of attention to discovering outside my monotonous life.

Please do not judge me. I love my family to the core, but this whole thing is about me, and I don't want to give an explanation about it to anyone else; perhaps someone in my situation will understand my point of view.

I am a shy and introverted personality with a minimum social circle. I am an exceptionally good listener and I never judge. A kind heart who always prioritizes smiles on others rather on self - as my near ones say. I give off nerd vibes - so love technology and gadgets, and I watch a lot of sci-fi. Space movies intrigue me a lot and mix that with Dragonball anime - you know how I am.

I love coffee and chocolates, I can be bribed over them.

I am open to chatting about anything, yes, anything (SFW/NSFW/mix), and if we hit it off, I don't mind it being a long-term connection. Oh! I just love the thrill of waiting for a message - the anticipation!!!

You can be anywhere in the world! Just have an open mind! If you like what I wrote drop a Reddit message with a few lines about yourself. Also, I am not looking for any affair or relationship. Just harmless fun!

Start with **soft textiles**—think plush throw blankets, oversized cushions, and a fluffy area rug to anchor your seating area.

* **Energy Boost**: Combat fatigue for high-intensity workouts.
* **Improved Focus**: Sharpen concentration for better mind-muscle connection.
* **Enhanced Pumps**: Increase blood flow to muscles for hypertrophy.
* **Delayed Fatigue**: Train harder and longer with ingredients like beta-alanine.

# Types of Pre-Workout Formulas

Choose based on your goals and tolerance:

# 1. Stimulant-Based Formulas

* **Key Ingredients**: Caffeine (150–300mg), L-theanine (to balance jitters).
* **Best For**: Energy and alertness.
* **Who Should Avoid**: Caffeine-sensitive individuals or late-day trainers.

# 2. Non-Stimulant Formulas

* **Key Ingredients**: Citrulline malate (6–8g), beta-alanine (3–6g), glycerol.
* **Best For**: Avoiding caffeine crashes or evening workouts.

# 3. Pump-Focused Formulas

* **Key Ingredients**: L-citrulline (6–8g), agmatine, nitric oxide boosters (nitrates).
* **Best For**: Vascularity and nutrient delivery during hypertrophy training.

# 4. Nootropic Formulas

* **Key Ingredients**: Alpha-GPC (300–600mg), tyrosine, huperzine A.
* **Best For**: Mental clarity and focus-driven sessions (e.g., technique work).

# 5. Natural/Organic Formulas

* **Key Ingredients**: Green tea extract, rhodiola rosea, electrolytes.
* **Best For**: Clean-energy seekers avoiding synthetic additives.

# Key Ingredients to Look For

* **Caffeine**: 150–300mg for energy (match your tolerance).
* **Beta-Alanine**: 3–6g to delay muscle fatigue (tingles are normal).
* **Citrulline Malate**: 6–8g for pumps and endurance.
* **Creatine Monohydrate**: 3–5g for strength (often included in pre-workouts).
* **Electrolytes**: Sodium, potassium for hydration during endurance training.

# How to Maximize Pre-Workout Benefits

1. **Timing**: Take 20–30 minutes pre-workout on an empty/stomach for faster absorption.
2. **Cycling**: Avoid dependency by taking 1–2 weeks off stimulants every 8 weeks.
3. **Hydration**: Drink 16–20oz of water to amplify effects and prevent cramps.
4. **Stacking**: Pair with intra-workout carbs (e.g., cluster dextrin) for endurance.

# Where to Buy Pre-Workout

* **Amazon/Walmart**: Widest variety, including budget and premium brands.
* **Specialty Retailers** (GNC, Vitamin Shoppe): Expert advice and niche formulas.
* **Direct from Brands**: Often include free samples or loyalty discounts.

# Flavor and Formula Options

* **Naturally Flavored**: Sweetened with stevia or monk fruit (lower calorie).
* **Artificial Flavors**: Bolder tastes but may contain artificial dyes.
* **Unflavored**: Ideal for mixing with intra-workout carbs or BCAAs.

# Safety and Side Effects

* **Start Low**: Begin with half a scoop to assess tolerance.
* **Avoid Overstimulation**: Don’t combine with other caffeine sources (coffee, energy drinks).
* **Tingling (Paresthesia)**: Harmless side effect of beta-alanine.",1,1737887903.0,suppreview,0,1.0,False

**What is Hygge?**  
It's Danish concept which I recently came to know about from a friend. To put simply it is all about creating a comforting, relaxed atmosphere and enjoying simple pleasures—like good company, warm drinks, and a chilled-out ambiance. Here is a resource which pretty much covers many things about it: [https://www.visitdenmark.com/denmark/things-do/danish-culture/what-hygge](https://www.visitdenmark.com/denmark/things-do/danish-culture/what-hygge)

Also, there is a sub on this topic in case you want to check out: [https://www.reddit.com/r/hygge/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hygge/)

So here is the plan:

* Small group of **4–5 people**
* Tentative dates: **February 1st or 2nd** (exact date/time to be confirmed once we have enough interested folks)
* Potentially meet at a cozy coffee shop (open to other venue suggestions in my DMs!)
* In the spirit of Hygge, we’ll chat about what makes us feel comfortable, what we appreciate in life, and any related topics that warm our hearts.
* If all goes well, I’d love to make this a regular get-together with the same group.

I’m trying this for the first time, so please come with an open mind and a willingness to participate. If you’re interested, **send me a DM** with a little bit about yourself, whether you can make it on those dates, and your preferred time.

Looking forward to your responses✨

**TL;DR:** Hosting a small Hygge-themed meetup (4–5 people) in Berlin on Feb 1 or 2 to chat about cozy comforts and life’s simple pleasures. DM me if you’d like to join!",5,1737887022.0,berlinsocialclub,4,0.73,False

1iab2ws,https://www.reddit.com/r/seoul/comments/1iab2ws/read_this_if_youre_a_student_looking_for_an/,Read this if you're a student looking for an apartment to stay in,"Hi there!

I'm a student at SNU in my second semester. Currently the apartment I am staying in is looking for other two tenants for two single rooms that have no tenants right now and I have received the ok to look for my own future housemates by the landlady.

The apartment is one metro station away from Seoul National University Station. It has the following rooms that you share with other tenants (one of which is me):

1) kitchen (two burner tops, oven, microwave, toaster, kettle, rice cooker, sink, pots, pans, plates, fridge with freezer, table ect)
2) living room (sofa, mirror, tv, lamp, Aircon, coffee table ect)
3) bathroom (shower, sink, toilet ect): this one I would only use for the sink and sometimes for the shower, as I do have a private bathroom with a toilet and somewhat of a shower
4) balcony (washing/dryer, ect)

The apartment in on the 3rd floor, and the rent is 650.000 won (security deposit is 300.000 won and it's used to cover for electricity and gas, and then down payment of 650.000 won is used to pay for the last month of rent, so it's very cheap overall)

The two rooms for rent come with a super single bed, a closet (one of the two closets as an additional section, making it bigger), a large desk with a chair and lamp. You do get at least one pair of bedding (pillow, comforter, one set of covers) but I do have a set of covers that I bought myself very recently and only used once that I'd be more than happy to sell at half the price of what I paid for them (I'm a broke student sorry).

We are allowed to have guests over, and while usually you'd technical have to ask the landlady, we never did as no one really checked on that and all of the tenants at the time were ok with it (but obviously you can ask if you want to feel more at ease)

For reference, I was once in one of the single rooms, but now I will move to the larger single room as I can afford it and it's more convenient.
The house is located on a slight hill, so be aware of that. It's super close to a bunch of restaurants, countless convenience stores, a 2 minute walk away from the local market and cheap supermarkets (best if you visit the one that is in the street where the local market is), and it is in a very quiet residential area. The neighbors on the apartment floor are a couple with a young child but they are not noisy at all and are super nice and helpful. Both the landlady and manager speak English, and the landlady also speaks German.

If you are interested, please feel free to pm me, I have photos that I can share with you, and after I vet you (sorry just gotta make sure I'm not letting a creep or super messy person in) I will be more than happy to share the manager's email so that you may contact him.

I’ve got a daughter from a previous relationship (she’s almost 3) and we’ve got a 8 month old son together. When we first got together, things were so good, but over time I’ve found myself getting sadder and lonelier by the day.
For example, last night my daughter didn’t go to sleep until 2:30am, she’s going through a huge stage of clinginess and sleep regression, so I didn’t get to sleep until ridiculously late however, her and her brother still woke up early so naturally I get up, but he’s still in bed and no matter how much I ask for help he just gets annoyed at me and doesn’t get up to help, him not getting up is an almost daily occurrence, he’ll usually sleep until at least 1pm, normally closer to 3pm so I’m on my own all day yet have no access to the bedroom because he’s in there asleep. I feel like a single parent every single day. Then when it comes to time we do get to spend together, he’ll just sit playing pubg instead of spending time with me, he doesn’t wanna watch anything with me, he doesn’t want to do anything creative with me (i do art a lot but he “doesn’t do that”), i ask him to come out for coffee and thrift shopping but he doesn’t wanna “just walk around”, i ask him what he wants to do if the things i’m suggesting don’t interest him and all he does is talk about sex, but because i’m not being emotionally satisfied i don’t want to have sex at all, but it seems to be all he wants from me. I just feel so lonely & i don’t know what to do. I don’t want to break up, I want to figure out a way to fix things but i just don’t know how to try anymore. I’m constantly running on hardly any sleep while he gets all the sleep he wants yet he’s the grumpy one, I just don’t get it. ",1,1737886901.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False
