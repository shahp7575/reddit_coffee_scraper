1hmjwg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipIndia/comments/1hmjwg8/25m_senior_colleagues_rohans_mom_please_help/,25M. Senior colleagues & Rohan’s Mom. Please help🙏,"Hello!! 👋🏻👋🏻
A little about me: I’m a 25-year-old guy, 5'5"", and happy enough to know I’m not unattractive, but humble enough to recognize I’m not the star (though some women insist otherwise – and I can’t help but think they’re just being nice). I’m physically fit (I've maintained this lifestyle for 8-9 years), musically inclined, and work as an IT professional and part-time teacher.

Here’s my dilemma:

I’ve been working at my current company for about two years now, and I’d say I’m a pretty affable guy. During my time here, I’ve made a few female friends in their late 30s and 40s. While we’re not on the same team, we work under the same department, and our conversations usually revolve around things outside of work. We laugh a lot, and I genuinely enjoy the connection. They’re all beautiful women, and honestly, I’d love to take that connection to a deeper level ;)
What confuses me, though, is that I don’t see them engaging with other men or younger men in the same way they do with me. I’m not sure if they’re just being friendly, or if there’s something more there. To add to the mix, I tend to dress a bit more sharply than most IT professionals, like I’m preparing for a big sales pitch, so I might be adding a bit of ""eye candy"" to the office. 💁🏻‍♂️ I’m not great at picking up subtle hints, so the most I’ve done is invite them for coffee and casual chats in the pantry.

I also have this dilemma outside of work, within my gym group, which has become a small, tight-knit family. I’m the youngest member, surrounded by mothers, older single ladies (my paradise 🥹), and some older guys (chill uncles). It’s an inspiring group; these people are in fantastic shape for their 40s, and financially in really good places. I aspire to be like them as I grow older. The group is unique because the level of conversation is different from with people my age. 
Now, there’s Rohan’s mom, who doesn’t usually hang out with the rest of us but is pretty chill with me. I find her refreshing; she often comes to me with lifting questions, and I help anyone in the gym, but with her, it feels different. I recently took a break from the gym due to an injury, but a mutual friend (who’s also my student) told me that Rohan’s mom has been missing my presence. I can’t even explain how much that made me smile inside. I suggested we all meet up sometime, but she (my student) has been unreliable, and I don’t want to push or seem too forward. I value the network I’ve built and don’t want to jeopardize it by misreading signs or making the first move. I’d be too embarrassed and likely retreat into my shell.

I’m really torn because I don’t want to ruin the friendships I’ve formed, but I also don’t want to miss an opportunity to connect further with someone I genuinely enjoy spending time with. I’d appreciate any advice from those who’ve been in a similar situation. Cheers!!

And by the way, belated Merry Christmas! Wishing you all love, joy, peace, and happiness in the new year! 🥳

I am friends with his sister and his mom and would often visit their house in the past. I was getting signals he May be interested in me, so I kind of distanced myself from him. After realizing I was being a bit rude (and after all the nice things he had done for me), I decided to start talking to him again. I really didn't think he was my type at the time though.

But here we are-

He is a very social person, and gets along with women well (not in a flirty way), I don't know if he views me any different? For example, in the past he would buy my coffee or food for me, at one point even giving me a limited edition item.  These happened ages ago, but I'm noticing tiny details and behaviors that might suggest he may have thing for me? Then I go and look at how he interacts with other women and think he's that way with everyone.

But also recently, we spent the entire day together in a group, lots of coincidences of us getting paired up for games or sitting next to each other and overall nearby pressence. I will mention again, there were other people there- myself, my 2 friends who are in their teens, and his sister. But then when I sent him a request on social media, he rejected my follow request. The following day, I saw him out with his family and switched seats with him mom after my friend and I showed up.. He might've just been allow his mom to chat with me, or he was creating a barrier..?

I've been going on emotional rollercoasters lately, overanalyzing his behavior with me and all..  It's starting to not look so hopeful, unless he really is that reserved. Would love some outside perspective",1,1735200201.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

I’m wanting to use some of my Christmas money on a new pair of headphones and would love some advice. I’m totally new to this world but I definitely appreciate good gear!

I’m looking for on-ear, preferably bluetooth headphones mostly to use in my home office/around the house while cleaning/occasionally out and about in airports and coffee shops. As for budget, my hard line is $120 USD, although I would reeeeally prefer to stay under \~80. I know it isn’t much, but right now anything is an upgrade from my current setup (old AirPods) lol. Here’s some more detail if you want em:

Decent ANC would be preferable, but it’s not like I need it to be bulletproof or anything. Honestly I’ll be using them in a relatively quiet environment about 85% of the time; I just love good ANC for when I’m traveling/out and about. 

I’ll likely most often be using them connected to my laptop or iPad while working for hours at a time, and would  love if they had a decent mic . Most often they’ll be used for listening to music (soundtracks or ambiance/lofi, usually) and getting on Discord calls with friends - pretty casual stuff, I’m not a producer or anything fancy. I just really appreciate good sound quality and am willing to invest in a pair that’s as crisp and tonally balanced as my budget allows. 

Honestly sound quality, comfort, and reliability are what matter most to me - I’ve just never invested in a good pair of headphones before (always used random wireless earbuds wherever I could get em) and am really excited to finally be able to afford something nice :) 

Any advice would be appreciated - brands you trust, what to avoid when it comes to the billion headphones on big sites like Amazon, your first pair of headphones that you liked, etc. Thanks so much in advance!!",1,1735200131.0,HeadphoneAdvice,1,1.0,False

------------------------------------------------------------------

Coffee is a beloved beverage for many, but it can leave unsightly stains on your teeth. If you're seeking the most effective solutions for removing those pesky coffee stains, you're in the right place. Your smile deserves to be bright and shiny, and with a bit of care and the right methods, you can achieve just that.

### Understanding Coffee Stains

Coffee stains occur because of tannins, the natural compounds found in coffee. These tannins can cling to enamel, leading to discoloration over time. The good news is, there are several effective approaches to tackle coffee stains, ranging from simple home remedies to professional treatments.

### Effective Home Remedies

If you want to take a DIY route, consider these popular home remedies:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Baking Soda and Water:** Mix equal parts of baking soda and water to form a paste. Brush your teeth gently with this paste to remove surface stains. Baking soda is mildly abrasive, making it a natural stain remover.
- **Hydrogen Peroxide:** This common household item can be used as a mouth rinse. Combine equal parts of hydrogen peroxide and water, swish it around in your mouth for about a minute, then rinse. Be cautious with hydrogen peroxide as it can irritate gums if used excessively.
- **Apple Cider Vinegar:** Though acidic, apple cider vinegar can help break down stains. Dilute it with water and swish it in your mouth. Rinse thoroughly afterward to protect your enamel.
- **Strawberries:** Believe it or not, strawberries can help whiten your teeth. Mash a few strawberries and combine them with baking soda. Apply this blend to your teeth, leave it for 5 minutes, then rinse well. The malic acid in strawberries can help lift stains.

### Over-the-Counter Solutions

If home remedies aren’t giving you the results you want, there are plenty of over-the-counter products designed specifically for teeth whitening. Look for:

- **Whitening Toothpaste:** Many brands offer toothpaste with special whitening formulas that can help reduce discoloration. Regular brushing with these products can gradually brighten your smile.
- **Whitening Strips:** These are thin, flexible strips coated with a whitening gel containing hydrogen peroxide. Apply these strips to your teeth for the recommended time each day for a couple of weeks for visible results.
- **Whitening Kits:** Home whitening kits include mouth trays and a whitening gel. The trays are usually custom-fitted for your teeth, allowing for even application of the bleaching agent.

### Professional Solutions

If you have significant coffee stains or want faster results, consider seeking professional help. Dentists offer several effective treatments, including:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **In-Office Teeth Whitening:** This is a powerful method where a dentist applies a strong whitening gel to your teeth. Using a special light or laser enhances the results. It typically takes only about one hour for a noticeable difference.
- **Custom Whitening Trays:** Your dentist can create custom trays for you to use at home. These trays allow for better gel application and can lead to professional-level results over a few weeks.

### Prevention Tips to Keep Teeth Bright

While it’s essential to know how to remove coffee stains, it’s just as crucial to prevent them. Here’s how you can keep your teeth looking their best:

- **Drink Water:** Rinse your mouth with water after having coffee. This can help wash away some of the tannins before they settle on your teeth.
- **Use a Straw:** If you sip coffee through a straw, you can minimize contact between the liquid and your teeth.
- **Maintain Good Oral Hygiene:** Brush twice a day and floss daily. Regular dental check-ups can also keep stains at bay.

Finding the best teeth whitening solution for coffee stains can greatly improve your confidence and smile. Choose the method that fits your needs best, whether it’s a home remedy, over-the-counter product, or professional treatment. Remember, consistency is key, so stick to your routine for the best results.

Natural Remedies vs. Professional Treatments for Teeth Whitening
----------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to achieving a brighter smile, the options available can be overwhelming. Many people seek out solutions for teeth whitening, especially those who enjoy coffee and may have developed unsightly stains on their teeth. You may be wondering what the best approach is for you: natural remedies or professional treatments. Both options have their pros and cons, which we will discuss in detail.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Natural Remedies

Natural teeth whitening remedies have become popular due to their accessibility and perceived safety. Here are some common options:

- **Baking Soda:** This mild abrasive can help scrub away surface stains. Mix a small amount with water to form a paste, and use it as a toothpaste once or twice a week.
- **Activated Charcoal:** Known for its adsorbent properties, activated charcoal can attract and remove particles that stain your teeth. Brush gently with it once in a while.
- **Hydrogen Peroxide:** This natural bleach can lighten stained teeth. Dilute it with equal parts water and use it as a mouth rinse. Be cautious with the frequency, as overuse can damage enamel.
- **Apple Cider Vinegar:** Though potent, this vinegar can help whiten teeth when used occasionally as a rinse, due to its acidic nature. However, it should be followed by a good rinse with water to protect enamel.
- **Strawberries:** Containing malic acid, strawberries can act as a natural whitener. Mashing a few strawberries and applying the paste to your teeth for five minutes may help remove stains.

While these remedies can be effective for some, results may vary. They are generally safer alternatives, but some individuals may experience sensitivity or adverse reactions. Always consult your dentist before trying a new remedy.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Professional Treatments

For those seeking quicker results, professional teeth whitening treatments can offer significant advantages. Here are a few options utilized by dental professionals:

- **In-Office Whitening:** This treatment involves the application of a high-concentration bleaching agent by a dentist. In just one session, you can achieve several shades lighter teeth.
- **At-Home Kits from Dentists:** Your dentist can provide customized whitening trays and professional-strength gel for more controlled whitening from the comfort of your home.
- **Laser Whitening:** This advanced technique uses laser light to enhance the effects of the whitening gel, providing faster and often more dramatic results.

Choosing a professional route usually guarantees faster results. However, it can be more expensive and may cause temporary sensitivity. Schedule a consultation to ensure you understand the procedure and costs involved.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Key Differences

When deciding between natural remedies and professional treatments, consider the following factors:

- **Effectiveness:** Professional treatments generally provide quicker and more noticeable results compared to natural remedies.
- **Cost:** Natural remedies are often low-cost or free, while professional treatments can range from moderately priced to expensive.
- **Safety:** Natural options are typically safe if used properly, but some methods may damage teeth if misused. Professional treatments are conducted under the supervision of dental experts, minimizing risks.
- **Time Commitment:** Natural remedies often require consistent use over time to see results, whereas professional treatments can offer instant improvements.

### Making the Decision

Ultimately, your choice will depend on your budget, your desired results, and your comfort level with each method. You may also consider trying natural remedies first to see if they work for you, while saving professional treatments for more stubborn stains. Always prioritize oral health by consulting with a dentist, who can guide you to the best solution based on your individual needs.

Whichever path you take, achieving a brighter smile can significantly boost your confidence. Be sure to maintain good oral hygiene to prevent future staining. Whether you opt for natural remedies or professional treatments, stay informed and choose wisely for your teeth!

### Conclusion

Finding the best teeth whitening solutions for coffee stains can significantly enhance your smile and boost your confidence. As we've explored, there are various effective treatments available. Whether you weigh the benefits of natural remedies, like baking soda or activated charcoal, against professional treatments such as in-office bleaching and custom whitening trays, it's crucial to consider your specific needs and preferences.

Natural remedies can be appealing due to their accessibility and cost-effectiveness. They often use ingredients that are gentle on enamel and can be incorporated easily into your routine. However, while these methods may gradually improve your dental appearance, they might not be as fast or as effective for everyone, especially if your coffee stains are severe.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
On the other hand, professional teeth whitening solutions are designed for quick results and typically offer a more consistent outcome. These treatments are administered by dental professionals, ensuring safety and effectiveness. If you’re looking for immediate and noticeable results, professional options are often worth the investment.

Ultimately, the best choice for you will depend on your lifestyle, budget, and the extent of your coffee stains. Remember, maintaining good oral hygiene and limiting coffee intake can also help keep stains at bay. By making informed decisions and seeking guidance from your dentist, you’ll be on your way to achieving a brighter, whiter smile that you can proudly show off. Embrace the options that suit you best, and enjoy the journey to a stain-free smile!

Winter is the perfect time to layer textures and create a snug environment. A [round carpet for living](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/textiles/rugs/round-rugs) **room** with a plush or shaggy texture adds warmth and softness underfoot.

I’ve also been homeless for 11 years. My sponsor just dropped me because they don’t think this program can help me. My last sponsor and the one before that are certain I don’t understand that I’m an alcoholic. The one before that thinks I’m dramatic. 

I want to drink right now. It’s all I can think about. I have 4 months off alcohol and two days off drugs. The shelters are all full, they have been for months, and the space I’ve been hiding out in and all my belongings are covered in mold. My skin is covered in rashes and I just got prescribed an inhaler as a result, and was told “good luck.” Who the fuck wouldn’t want to get loaded living like this? 

I’ve read the literature- I relate, but what if I’m not an alcoholic/addict and have been abusing the supports? What if I’ve just been looking for a reprieve from the weather, some coffee, and maybe occasionally the opportunity to bitch about life? 

I feel like I’ve been overwhelming for all my sponsors. I barely call/text- maybe once every two weeks and purposely vague. The moment I’m honest and open, I’m told my problems are way too big for this program. Which… yeah. I never expected AA or the sister programs to solve my problems, but maybe I’m just not an alcoholic/addict. Maybe I do actually need substances to get through this. Maybe I won’t ever get out of my situation and I need to be just doing whatever I can to enjoy my time on earth. ",4,1735199337.0,alcoholicsanonymous,1,1.0,False

""","I'm so fed up with this man.  The passive aggressiveness has escalated lately and that comment today of all days was the straw that broke me and I just kicked him out the bedroom. He's lucky that's a far as he had to walk to sleep tonight. Ill try to keep it brief. 

So our house isn't dirty, or even cluttered.  It's looking like the aftermath of a tornado from Christmas, but i don't care on this day usually.  My youngest is 8 and the only one we had for the night. The other 2 are 18 and 22 and moved out.  

I didn't sleep but about 25 minutes Monday night because I get bad vertigo which makes me nauseous and it's a shitty cycle.  Was up yday cleaning house, make a nice breakfast for us 3 by myself while he dicks around smoking on his phone drinking coffee. Took 2 unisom at 3 am which did jack shit but make me feel weak, so it was a challenge to even clean my kitchen to wash fucking forks. 

I'm wrapping family gifts in my room with the door shut and he comes in to tell me kid wants juice. Asswad had to walk THROUGH the kitchen to tell me. I get it for but am grumbling about him in the kitchen.  

At 4:30 pm while I have Santa cookie dough forming in the fridge for an hour, he informs me his brother is throwing an impromptu dinner can we please go? It's at 6. I have dough chilling for another hour, we haven't showered, still in pajamas, and i CANNOT not have cookies out. And have only met his brother a few times since we went to school together but didn't know each other.  So even though I express my discontent about being exhausted already, have at least 2 hours of decorating  to do and ALL Santa presents to wrap PLUS prep for dinner today.... i fucking said yes. Cause he recently repaired his relationship with the brother after brother finally dumped bitch of a cheating wife and moved out.  So I pack up my decorating shit including a rolling pin, flour, pastry, cutters, cookie cutters serving tray etc cause of COURSE his brother won't have that shit. It actually went okay, aside from everyone taking off to the living room including the kid, leaving me alone to decorate 2 dozen cookies by myself.  If course I washed up his cookie sheets he amazingly had and swept and cleaned up the kitchen. Alone. 

Did I mention it's 40 minutes round trip through a ghetto town, my truck, my gas, he moved in with me after his truck blew a gasket and he lost his job last YEAR?? He makes random money but I pay every bill including his phone. Dead ass broke but can borrow money from his buddy for smokes and beer. 

He'll help out around the house once in a while, but he's insanely slow and a perfectionist, won't take initiative to say maybe clean a toilet. Think he's done it twice. He's good about the trash but I gotta hound him to even make it to the fucking can. Who opens a can of soup and puts it in a bowl, then decides to leave said can on the counter DIRECTLY ABOVE the trash? Our use ketchup on his fried potatoes at 11am, then have the balls to ask why it's out still at 5?! ""Oh I guess I forgot I used it last."" MFER so I used it last because I made YOUR PLATE FIRST. ""You don't have to do that you can serve yourself first."" No i can't cause 1. You'll scorch my pans cooking too high and getting distracted on your phone and 2. If i plate meals your hogass will take whatever is left no matter if the kid hasn't asked for more yet. Ugh.  So...

I stay up until 4:30am ( heres my hug to the holy shit I'm dead tired other bromo who also posted  about similar bullshit) wrapping Santa gifts while he wrapped about 4. Most of kids' were small and i don't have much spare money- my fucking back hurts from carrying 4 people- my 18yo included sometimes which I don't mind he's mostly independent- so I ended up wrapping 7 packages each kid (28 total including my new grams baby) gifts for all the rest of friends and tiny stocking gifts and stuffing paper crackers while he smoked and dicked on his phone. I finally get to lay down and I'm out at about 6 and she's up by 7:50. He lays in bed while I get her set up with her robe and juice and one gift of those sqiushsmelly bullshit things, start coffee and start loudly talking about how ""we're gonna start soon at R gets out of bed!"" Took him like 20 minutes. Had to ask him to take pics. Had to ask for a garbage bag. Had to ask him to open monster high dolls and impossible boxes. She's going to be picked up by her bio dad at 1130. Now mind you, we've been together since she was 2 and they get along great. I fully expect him to share family duties. Got him a wallet, body wash kit and beard tamer(hint hint boy genius) So we finish opening gifts and it's like 10, I ask him to pick up the living room while I make breakfast. (Big wow: he didn't do shit but actual wrapping papers)  As I'm making her omelette and toast and hulling berries, he's doing the same thing as the day before. I realize I have no silverware so I call him in and ask him to wash a fork real quick so u can whip eggs. Guy starts cleaning out the dirty dishes in the sink while I have food cooking in pans trying to time it right.  I ask him to forget running water just use the rag andthe quick soap. He tells me no and ""my way isn't a good as yours i know but it works"" 😬 so I simply pick up the sponge and fork and wash it in 10 seconds. He huffs and puffs about how if I'd just waited he'd have it JEEEHHHZZZ... well my shits gonna burn and I need to whisk these eggs so I can feed the kid change her clothes brush her 3ft long crazy hair get her teeth brushed pack her shit.... 

I get her food done and just plop it on a TV tray. I get his omelet done (and I was half tempted to say fuck it trust me by this point but I didn't wanna deal with sulking and the PA attitude) and get his shit made.  Plates done and he washed the silverware outta spite bit I'll take it...while I'm doing his food telling me again I can just make mine first..ughhhhHH I get my omelet in the pan and the taters are burning so I move them off the heat and tell him to watch the stove as I pass the bedroom.  I go lay out her clothes and pack a fast bag and gather her switch shit and of COURSE her dad knocks right then. So I go let him in, accidentally am sharp with him cause he says he wants to wait outside and I'm like NO please come help me move her along in getting dressed and her stuff im cooking and she still isn't done eating. He comes in and starts to help immediately. I told R to go smoke or something make yourself scare.  They don't hate each other but don't really talk or get along either. Civil for the kid at least. 

Of course my fucking eggs got crispy brown and rubbery.  And my potatoes were cold. Toast was buttered too soon and soggy. Left it on the counter and walked them out. Got bio a small gift, he didn't get me anything but I didn't expect him to, he does still get me gifts from our daughter like slippers or sockssometimes though. 

I come back to the kitchen and he's smoking in the back room again. I ask him why he didn't check my food while I was getting her belongings together and he said ""i didn't know it needed it"". But yet heard me bitching in the kitchen about it to myself (FUCKING YAY cold burnt or soggy? I get ALL 3 for Christmas) He brought it up later like it was funny. 

I snapped this evening. Was working like a demon on a crochet project for a friend im seeing tomorrow before my daughter returns. Had a black and white arizona on the floor so i didn't have to change position to reach it at the foot of my bed. Just got a chance to burn one and relax, having cut pecan pie and served this oaf a damn quarter of it. he comes  in and boots my tea across the room already eating before his ass hit the chair and not watching where he was going.

It's a tiny room yall and my only tea. It wasn't a lot that spilled, but I said  Damn it and jumped up for a towel. The exchange went:

Him: sorry I wad looking at my plate my HANDS are full

Me: Bro (he hates this lol)  watch where you're about to walk not what's in your hands.

Him: sooOo sorry I knocked over your tea you left  the floor while my hands were full jeez your right I'm the dumb one here I'll make sure to watch at my feet everywhere I go UGH. I'm so stupid. 

He's already clumsy.  Has hit head on everything. A beam in my basement a dozen times at least. I think it's funny at this point and don't care he gets mad when I yell YOU KNOW HOW TALL YOU ARE DUDE! After I hear the inevitable thunk after he goes to the basement.  Started to anticipate it, lol. Anyway

I  was so pissed I just said to stop talking and drop it. Hit play on the movie we were watching- well I was while he doom scrolled. This fucker watches reels and videos sitting 3 feet from me and gets irritated when I constantly tell him to turn it down can't hear the show. Asked him a quotation twice about the show and he was ignoring it.  Pissed me off worse.  Couldn't remember what the phrase was called so I googled it and told him I was.  Informed him it was a type of self blame manipulation and weaponized Incompetence. He shifts  the blame to me to absolve himself of guilt. I'm so sick of the shit. The hobosexual is now asleep on my couch and I have no fuckall desire to wake him. Only thing I received for Christmas was a cute little wet n wild palette from my grade school kid from her school store. It means the world to me now.  I'm gonna stick with this kid only for awhile I think. She's great company now she's a bit older. He and i aren't married so he can come back when gets a damn job and some progress in therapy. Or he can be ass n elbows down the road cause at this point I'm ambivalent. 

So much for brief and thanks for listening bromos. I'll be up all night doing this project then I'm going to enjoy a break after the weekend all by myself. Probably will save some money without him taking the returnable cans back along with change he finds. Happy Holidays and let's all make resolutions to stick to our boundaries and draw lines in concrete instead of sand. So much for brief!😂",1,1735198929.0,breakingmom,1,0.67,False

1hmjkxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1hmjkxb/maximizing_small_spaces_home_decor_hacks_for/,Maximizing Small Spaces: Home Decor Hacks for Compact Living,"Living in a compact space doesn’t mean sacrificing style or functionality. With the right [home decor](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) strategies, you can make any small area feel more spacious, inviting, and personalized. From clever storage solutions to eye-catching [decoration items](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration), these hacks will help you create a home that feels larger than life.

# 1. Use Wall Space Effectively

When floor space is limited, the walls become your best friend. Incorporating vertical decor can help maximize space while adding personality to your home.

* **Macrame Wall Hanging**: These boho-chic pieces add texture and warmth to your walls without taking up any floor space. Hang one above your bed, sofa, or a small entryway table to create a cozy and stylish focal point.
* **Wall Mirror**: Mirrors are a must-have for small spaces. A strategically placed [wall mirror](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration/mirrors) can reflect light and create the illusion of a larger room. Consider a large, decorative mirror to make a bold statement while enhancing the sense of space.

# 2. Invest in Multi-Functional Furniture

Compact living calls for smart furniture choices. Look for pieces that serve multiple purposes:

* **Storage Ottomans**: Use them as seating, footrests, or coffee tables, and take advantage of the hidden storage inside.
* **Wall-Mounted Shelves**: Combine practicality with style by displaying **home decor** pieces like plants, books, or small sculptures on floating shelves.
* **Foldable Tables**: Perfect for dining or working, foldable tables can be stowed away when not in use.

# 3. Opt for Light and Neutral Colors

Color can significantly affect how spacious a room feels. Light and neutral tones, like whites, creams, and soft pastels, make rooms appear larger and airier. Add pops of color with **decoration items** like throw pillows, vases, or rugs to keep the space visually interesting without overwhelming it.

# 4. Create the Illusion of Height

Make your ceilings appear higher by drawing the eye upward:

* Hang curtains close to the ceiling and let them drape down to the floor.
* Use vertical art pieces, such as tall [macrame wall hanging](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/search?search_query=macrame+wall), to emphasize height and add elegance.
* Opt for tall shelving units to utilize vertical space efficiently.

# 5. Keep It Minimal and Organized

Clutter can quickly make a small space feel cramped. Embrace a minimalist approach:

* Choose a few statement **home decor** pieces rather than crowding your space with too many **decoration items**.
* Invest in stylish storage baskets or bins to keep everyday items out of sight.
* Use furniture with built-in storage, such as beds with drawers or wall-mounted desks.

# 6. Zone Your Space with Decor

In compact homes, it’s essential to create distinct zones for different activities, even within the same room:

* Use rugs to define areas like a living space or dining nook.
* Place a **wall mirror** to separate spaces visually while adding depth.
* Hang **macrame wall hangings** or artwork to mark specific zones, like a reading corner or workspace.

# 7. Add Layers with Textures

Layering textures can make even the smallest space feel rich and inviting:

* Pair soft throws with textured cushions for your sofa or bed.
* Use **macrame wall hangings** to introduce natural textures that complement wood or metal furniture.
* Incorporate woven baskets, rattan furniture, or textured vases as functional **decoration items**.

# 8. Incorporate Space-Saving Lighting

Lighting plays a vital role in creating the illusion of space. In small areas, avoid bulky floor lamps or table lamps and instead focus on space-saving options:

* Wall-mounted sconces free up surfaces while providing ambient lighting.
* Fairy lights or pendant lights add charm without taking up precious room.
* Mirrors combined with lighting amplify brightness and openness.

# 9. Think Outside the Box for Storage

Maximize every inch of your space with creative storage solutions:

* Utilize the area under your bed or sofa for storing seasonal items.
* Install hooks or racks behind doors for bags, scarves, or even small decor pieces.
* Use stylish storage containers as **home decor**, such as woven baskets or decorative boxes that look great on open shelves.

# 10. Personalize with Thoughtful Decor

Compact living spaces don’t have to feel generic. Add personality with meaningful **decoration items**:

* Display travel souvenirs, family photos, or artwork to make your space unique.
* Incorporate functional decor like **macrame wall hangings** or mirrors that double as design elements.
* Rotate small decor pieces seasonally to keep your space feeling fresh and updated.

# Final Thoughts

Maximizing small spaces is all about thoughtful design and purposeful **home decor** choices. By incorporating space-saving techniques and stylish **decoration items**, you can create a cozy, functional, and visually appealing home. Whether it’s a stunning **macrame wall hanging**, a statement **wall mirror**, or cleverly placed decor, every detail can make a big impact.

I am aiming this towards my fellow teen students as I have noticed there are other teens here. I hope my story will be able to break some stigma around at the very least the Guidance Counselling Office / Unit. I would like to ask nalang rin ng sorry kasi hindi ako well-versed sa pagsasalita sa Filipino, and this is also long.*

Good day! I will just call myself Coffee here, and I am currently a Grade 11 STEM Student. I was diagnosed last March 22, 2022 with Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features, which developed to become Bipolar Disorder 1 Mixed Type around 2023. I'm now currently in Full Remission and continue to take my daily maintenance medication.

It all started during the time of online classes, where I was exposed to the many dangers of the internet. It was during this period I had started to develop problems with my mental health, and my grades had started falling. I was a high achiever student, I had always been on the very top, which further made it worse as there were high expectations surrounding me. I'd like to go on with this story, but this is for another day.

Fast forward to face-to-face, I was Grade 9. I had already  been going to my psychiatrist for over half a year. I was a hardcore introvert, and I was struggling keeping up, especially with my entire section full of smart students. While I hesitated, I had to tell my class adviser and teachers with regards to my condition (so that they wouldn't be shocked if I suddenly had a depressive episode).

However, I had still struggled, and I would keep distance from my class. I would often talk only with my class adviser, but she wasn't also sure how to talk with me (as she was wary that I may be triggered).

One day, we were talking, and then ma'am suggested that I should go talk with the Guidance Counselors at the Guidance Counselling Office. I was afraid, I was scared, and I was anxious. I went blank, especially since I was afraid of them, especially of how usually only people who get in trouble is sent there. But ma'am assured me it would be okay, and that she would accompany me there.

We went in, and I was anxious. We sat and talked, it wasn't like anything I had expected. I was happy, I could express myself, I could let my emotions out. She (the guidance counselor) managed to calm me down, and I was assured especially since she said that they don't judge (like in Psychiatry OPD where they also don't judge, no matter what you had done). It was a decision I never regretted, and I could always go back in the case that I need someone to talk to.

To this day, while not frequently or often, when I am feeling really down and I cannot cope using my coping mechanisms, I could go there, knowing that I wouldn't be judged, that I would be guided, and that I would be helped.

To my fellow teen students, I hope that we break the stigma around the Guidance Counselling Office, especially as it is still commonplace to stigmatize it, with the word of ""ma-Guidance"". Know that it is a safe place that you can go to if you desperately need help.

I mainly encourage you to develop coping mechanisms or to try and find a way to cope with a problem, but if you ever are at school, and you don't know what to do, do know that the Guidance Counselling Office's doors are open and that you can ask them for help.

1hmjhj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1hmjhj6/hr_mother_told_me_about_change/,[HR] Mother Told Me About Change,"Mother told me the world spun around, like a brisk ballerina who couldn’t stop; forever in motion.



I found myself watching the clouds when the sun was high. They gave me pictures of dogs, cats, and funny people dancing in the sky. They never stayed to say “Hi”. I didn’t like that.



Mother told me to get out of bed, for it was time for school; an hour ahead. 



I found myself moving through my house, eating breakfast, and quickly transported among 30 others. My tranquility disrupted.



Mother told me, late at night, that dreams were vehicles of time travel, showing you a series of shorts until you eventually arrive hours ahead.



I found myself struggling to sleep, my time a valued resource. My time rather spent reading comics, staring at the climax, analyzing the lines, or just eyeing the stars, imagining them to disappear.



Mother told me everything falls at the same speed, whether a bowling ball over a building, or a remote from a couch.



I found myself sitting on our roof, dangling my feet over the gutters, wondering at what point would I fall if I stood and angled myself. I determined it wasn’t much.



Mother told me my bones would heal in time, and that pain is temporary.



I found myself bumping my casts to test if my bones were still there. She called it a nasty habit.



Mother told me my father’s time had been cut short, yet I remember him as he was yesterday.



I found myself seeing my dad in the backyard working on constructing a pool, He caught me peeping and sent a wave my way. Before he was simply constructing a pool, I miss that moment, now I must wave back and leave the windowsill.



Mother told me time came for everybody, even the birds and leaves.



I found myself testing the time of a squirrel. I remember it standing, looking away with its eyes on me. It was a still shot; it being mid inhalation, scruffy tail, straight posture, and loose paws. But that was before the rock elongated its body. My rock had broken time. I miss when the squirrel looked at me with its black eyes.

Mother told me the sun will eventually go dark, but not for a very very long day.



I found myself happy at its sight the next day, still bright and warm as yesterday.



Mother told me time will come for her one day, just as dad. I didn’t want that to happen.



I found myself under Mother’s and Father’s bed. His revolver sat in a small wooden box, untouched since the day he’d passed away. 



Mother told me her hair was growing grey, and my body was about to change. I don’t remember giving permission to Father Time to take my youth away.



I found myself plucking the hairs from my pits and pubes; they were smooth and completely the same, but when they came back too short to pluck, I had to scratch them away. They will stay the same.



Mother told me I had to get a job, work my time in exchange for money, so that one day I can suffice on my own when she’s away.



I found myself dazed walking, stocking, and putting things on racks. Only shot into the moment once a customer would displace any item I can set perfectly on display. I told the customers to “have a nice day.”



Mother told me I had to move out, then my clock hit noon, and my life was to start soon.



I found myself gazing at my mom while she cooked dinner at the end of the day, how she glowed from the sunset gold, how she seemed relaxed at the familiarity of cooking, and how she saw me standing on the doorway holding something shining. I miss my mom when she wasn’t so old and grey.



My mother once told me that when she met my dad again, she’d come see me when I wasn’t paying attention. Hiding in reflections and causing the creaks that filled my sleep.



I found myself posturing Mother in her favorite chair, the one she told stories to me when I was scared.



Mother once told me that an awful job would always be the same, monotonous in every way.



I found that to be a lie. When I clock in, click submit, write and clip, I become calm, within meditation.

Mother once told me that my boss would know what’s best, and I should follow the bet I can.



I found this to be a lie, when my boss told me to get him a cup of coffee before nine. This was not how I earned my dime.



Mother once told me that it isn't dangerous to play with knives.



I found myself playing a wonderful game with my boss, now my best friend, forever still. Still, until the red and blue find my bill.



Mother once told me she liked my smile.



I found myself smiling, atop the roof of my office building, standing on the edge, with Father’s Revolver pointing at my head. The red and blue positioned far behind my back, they shout and shout, changing the quiet windy nature of the sky.



Mother once told me that a decision is final, and will change everything.



I found myself making a decision, that will keep everything exactly the same, between the infinite time from which my existence experiences before the darkness consumes my head.



Or at least that's what I thought about while lying in bed, watching people pass by in orange and white, and through the bars blocking the clouds in the sky.

1hmjesd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/1hmjesd/wife_moved_out_and_wants_a_divorce_after_i_became/,Wife moved out and wants a divorce after I became suspicious of an affair.,"Posted this about a couple months ago in r/survivinginfidelity but it quickly got a lot of attention and was extremely easy to Google so I took it down after only a few days. I was worried she might find it. Coming back here because the mods in that sub took down my repost for some reason. I need some more advice specifically with new information that has come to light since the separation. It's posted in the update at the end. I have changed some key words throughout this story and spelled them out phonetically to make this less easy to Google.

Forgive me for this long and rambling post but I feel like I need to try my best to organize my thoughts and write down everything I know that has occured in the last few months that has led me to suspect that my wife is having an affair. First some background. My wife and I are both mid thirties. We have been married for almost a decade and were together for five years before marriage. We have 2 children under 5. She is the breadwinner and works from home while I am the stay at home dad. We spend a lot of time together and for the most part have always loved it that way. In recent years (mainly after the birth of our second child) she has become more depressed and our relationship hasn’t had the joy it once did. Our bedroom is anything but dead (we have always had an active sex life) but it seemed as though in the last couple years I found her wanting to spend more time at her friends house or reading alone in the evenings. This made me sad that she didn't want to spend as much time with me as I did with her but I did my best to accept that she was under a lot of stress and not be too needy. I may have not always succeeded in that. In the last year we also started to fight more often than before (often over very inconsequential things) and divorce was being threatened frequently in these arguments (always by her.) I would always do my best to try to convince her it was a terrible idea and plead with her to reconsider and she always did, but these discussions worried me greatly and made it very hard for me to feel secure in the relationship. Ultimately though I was terrified to lose her and maybe went into denial about how terrible of a sign it was that she was mentioning splitting up so often.

With that out of the way let me do my best to explain what has happened in our relationship and lead us to the separation and likely divorce that is coming. Over the last year or so my wife has been traveling around our state doing work trips that usually require a one night hotel stay. Back in May, 3 days after she returned from one of these trips I happened to be cleaning out her bag (something I have always done for her and something she has never considered to be crossing a boundary) and I found a re-seat (white paper with proof of purchases on it) for a purchase made at a grocery store by her hotel. The purchase (that was made at around 6:00pm) was for bier (from her favorite microbrewery) and cost $11.99. This immediately concerned me because not only was the bier her favorite but that night she had told me multiple times (once on the phone and twice via text) that she was extremely tired and would be going to bed at 7:00. At the time it seemed very strange that she would fall asleep that early (because she never does, it's almost always 9:00) and it also seemed weird that she was mentioning to me her plans to fall asleep at 7:00 so frequently. Sure enough, after I put our kids down for bed I texted her at around 7:10 and got no response for the rest of the night. I gave her a call as well and got one ring then sent to voicemail (which indicates a manually declined call). This sent me into a bit of a panic and I called again but this time it rang out all the way until voicemail. I barely slept that night wondering about the declined call but eventually convinced myself it was probably a dropped call and stopped worrying about things when she texted me in the morning that everything was fine.

But then of course a few days later I found that re-seat. When I confronted her with it she immediately seemed flustered and claimed that yes she had went to the grocery store but didn't buy any bier, she claimed that she had bought ""like a Pepsi"". I think Pepsi just popped into her head as the thing to say because she had told me she bought one at a mini mart a few weeks before when she went in and they didn't have what she wanted but she felt awkward and inclined to buy something so she just chose that. She never buys Pepsi. I then remembered that on that night she had mentioned that she went to a fast food restaurant for dinner. When I asked her why she didn't just get a Pepsi there with her meal (they sell it) she said that she didn't go into the grocery store with the intent of getting a Pepsi, but instead getting a Kumboocha but she passed on that because it was $6 and the Pepsi happened to be stocked right next to it. This immediately seemed wrong as well so I opened the app for that grocery store, changed the location to the store she was at and looked up the prices for every sku of Kumboocha in the store. They were all $3.50. Furthermore, Pepsi and Kumboocha were not stocked next to one another (the app shows the aisle locations of every item in the store). While I was in the app I also found that the only bier in the store from that brewery that was priced at $11.99 was a 4 pack of 16 oz cans of her absolute favorite variety from that specific microbrewery. Obviously she could not admit to buying this bier because then she would have to explain why she bought 64 oz of IPA to chug by herself on a work night an hour before she claimed to have fallen asleep and stopped responding to me.

So she simply stuck with the story that she didn't buy the bier. First she suggested that she must have gotten someone else's re-seat. But instead of investigating the re-seat and attempting to confirm that theory, she took it from my hands, crumpled it up and threw it away. When she left the room I immediately fished the re-seat from the trash can and matched the last 4 digits of the credit card on the re-seat to a credit card in her bag (this is the only credit card she has that I'm not an authorized user on and therefore can't read statements and don't get immediate notifications for transactions). When I confronted her about it being her re-seat suddenly her tone completely changed. She didn't even continue to deny it or act confused, she went onto the offensive claiming I was snooping, that I allow her no autonomy, that I was paranoid, and that she couldn't believe I was questioning whether or not she cheated. During this time she was incredibly enraged (hands trembling, yelling, etc) but we had to immediately pull ourselves together because we were literally minutes away from heading out the door to attend our daughter's mother's day performance at her preschool. On the drive over there I continued to gently press her about the re-seat and she ended up screaming at me and cussing me out in the parking garage with our 2 year old son in the backseat. She then began to threaten divorce which she knew would scare me into backing off and it did. I lied and told her I believed her and we tried to attend the performance acting as though nothing had just happened. Once we returned home I convinced her that she should at least contact the grocery store and try to get her money back. She agreed reluctantly and called them. On this call she gave unnecessary details about why she chose a Pepsi and claimed she bought it on sale for $1.99 which according to the app is not the regular price or a sale price. They left her with a reference number and said they would escalate the issue and have someone call her back. That escalated call would never come (or so she claims). A few days later, when I suggested she call them back if she wasn't hearing from them she began to primal shriek at me, threatened divorce, and said she would never be calling them again and she was done talking about it forever. She said she “couldn't believe I was making a huge deal about $10"" as if my concerns were all about money… On the phone they offered some theories as to what could have happened. First she said they suggested that the wrong code could have been entered into their system and Pepsis could have been popping up as bier. To that I replied that the re-seat showed that the item was bought in self checkout and was ID verified. Seems unlikely that you could get through the ID check process while holding a Pepsi without you or the employee realizing your purchase rung up as bier. She then landed on the excuse that someone else must have scanned the bier, got ID checked then walked out without paying. Then she came up, failed to scan her Pepsi, and accidently bought the bier without noticing on the screen or payment terminal that she was buying the wrong item for the wrong amount. This seemed like a nearly impossible explanation but I wanted to believe her so badly that I just tried to convince myself that maybe it was true.

After the call to the store she began texting me about how she didn't think she could continue in our relationship and that she had considered taking all the pills in my bedside drawer. These threats of divorce and suicide scared me into continuing on pretending like nothing was wrong for another week or so. I guess I just kind of froze. Some weeks later I finally got the courage to confront her about the declined call. She claimed that she didn't decline my call at all so I had her look in her phone and check and sure enough it was a declined call. This made her extremely upset but she claimed that she must have done it in her sleep. This excuse immediately seemed fishy because the morning after she ""fell asleep"" at 7:00 I asked her at around 5:00am about how she managed to sleep for 10 hours. She claimed that she was awake from around 1:00-3:00 am and couldn't sleep but then added that she didn't see my texts because she never looked at her phone because it was across the room charging. So how exactly could she have declined my phone call with her phone across the room? She had already told me that she didn't wear her smartwatch that night because it was irritating her wrist (this was in response to me suggesting that she show me her sleep data from that night to prove that she had actually fallen asleep at 7:00). So with no reasonable way to explain how she could have declined my call on either her phone or her watch she admitted that she lied about not having her phone beside her because she was just so worried that I would freak out about her not responding that she needed a good excuse for why she wasn't in touch that night. She claimed she woke up in a complete panic about not responding to my texts (because I'm so controlling) and just made up a lie. This also doesn't check out because I happened to open our text conversation that morning about 30 seconds before I saw all my missed texts suddenly mark as read and she began typing her first message of the morning. Within 1 minute of those messages getting marked as read she told me she was already in the hotel lobby getting coffee. If someone wakes up in a panic that they missed texts they would probably check them immediately from bed or at least from the toilet or at some point while getting dressed. The fact that her first texts to me came from her in the lobby suggests that she knew all those missed texts were there, she was just taking her time to reply to them when she felt ready.

Now that her official story was that her phone was indeed in the bed, I continued to gently press her about how it was possible that she declined my call in her sleep. On our phones, declining a call requires pressing and holding the button and dragging it down to decline. This seems like an impossible thing to do in your sleep and I mentioned that to her. She responded by starting to shriek at the top of her lungs and threatening to jump from the car while it was moving. These threats eventually died out and were replaced with more threats of divorce if I didn't stop ""interrogating"" her and making her feel ""on trial"". So naturally I backed off. We have 2 kids and a house and I didn't want to be divorced. I was scared. I wanted to believe her.

I spent the better part of the next 5 months trying my best to surpress all my feelings about this situation but ultimately I ended up confronting her about it in one way or another pretty consistently. I was desperate for her to come clean because I wanted to be able to move forward (I told her I could try to reconcile). I also wanted so badly to believe her that I would fish for reassurance that nothing happened and then try to convince myself I believed her. During this time she would swear on our kids lives that she did nothing, she would flip the script on me that I was the one throwing away our relationship with my distrust, and that I was betraying her and manipulating her by making her feel as though we were moving forward before revealing that I was still tortured by doubt. It was on my mind constantly. She would also occasionally slap me and shove me trying to show me how angry she was at me that I wouldn't let this go. She told me she hated me. At one point I asked her if she was still in love with me and she took a long pause before calmly saying ""no."" (She immediately walked that statement back when she saw how badly it hurt me to hear this.) There were days where I would convince myself I absolutely believed her because I didn't think the woman I knew could be so cruel as to gaslight me like this. Then by the evening I would be crying myself to sleep because I knew deep down there was no reasonable explanation for her having a re-seat for her favorite bier if she didn't buy it and there was no way she could have somehow declined my call in her sleep.

I was partially able to delude myself because I had no suspect for an affair partner. She showed me she had no installed (or ever installed and then deleted) dating apps on her phone, her coworkers are 2 older ladies, and she works from home and went on the work trip alone. She also knows nobody in that town. I had slight suspicions about one ex boyfriend of hers who is the only one she has that she doesn't hate but he lived 5 hours from the town where she was and it just seemed unlikely. He was also in the picture 15 years ago. However, she had run into him briefly at a restaurant the previous summer and he invited her out to catch up and have beers. She told me she politely declined and said that she had to return to her family with the food she was picking up and that was that. There was also a time about 10 years ago when I found that she was looking at all his photos on Facebook when I checked her browser history (not cool of me I know). Also, during this whole summer of hell she randomly started shoving me one morning and then blurted out ""there's things about me you don't even know!"" I thought for a moment and then said ""Have you had an abortion?"" She seemed shocked by my guess but said yes. I asked who got her pregnant and she replied that it was the boyfriend. I had never really known in detail how they had broken up but apparently when she found out she got pregnant she panicked and got an abortion without telling him, broke up with him, and then moved and went back to college. The story I had heard was more that he was an abusive asshole and an alcoholic. But apparently she left him while still being completely in love but just got scared and ran away.

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago. My wife is finishing up her last work trip of the year and while I'm still extremely bothered by the unexplainable evidence I had found, I'm trying my best to put it behind us and just move forward for the sake of our family. If she did cheat, certainly she would never do it again after seeing how much turmoil it caused in our relationship and how close our family was to being broken up. Or so I thought… The evening before her last work trip I happened to see her texting out on our patio through our laundry room window. The blinds in that room are almost never open but happened to be that night and I took a second to watch what she was doing. I don't think she thinks of this angle as being a possible way her screen could be watched because the blinds are just never open. Anyway, I watched for a second and noticed she wasn't only texting, but scrolling up and down through what must have been days and days of conversation. Then occasionally she would scroll to the bottom and respond. I zoomed way in and took a picture of the app she was using and while it was blurry and I couldn't read any words, I could tell by the UI that it wasn't her default messenger app where she texts most people and it wasn't Whatsapp where she texts me and her best friend. I then came out to the patio and asked who she was texting and she said it was her best friend even though she clearly hadn't been using WhatsApp. Just to rule out that she might have been texting someone else earlier in the default messenger app I checked her smartwatch later that night and she didn't even have any conversations from that day. So she was texting someone in some app I don't recognize and then saying she was texting her best friend (which would have been onWhatsapp) right after. I chose not to confront her about this because I just assumed she would deny it anyway and she would paint me as crazy for zooming in on her screen.

When she goes on work trips (she has had 3 since the re-seat trip) I had already become hypervigilant and seeing the shady texting she was doing only made me more so. I'm constantly looking to confirm what she says she's doing with anything I can find to back up her story. I'm just needing constant reassurance. So the night of her last trip when she tells me in the evening that she needs to get off the phone because she wants to watch a Netflix show, I go into her Netflix account and check if she's watching that show. She told me she was watching the season finale of a show and her watch progress bar didn't even show her as having completed the second to last episode of the season. I kept checking it for hours seeing if it would update and it never did. This freaked me out and so I decided to open her YewTewb profile on our TV where she is signed in to see if she was watching something else. I start looking through her watch history and I'm suddenly seeing tons of strange content she would never watch. Man content. Frisbee golf, motorcycles, hunting, biking/BMX, hiking, nature shows, rock climbing, rap music I recognized from my high school days... I immediately freaked out. All I have ever really been told about her ex boyfriend is that he was really into rock climbing. A quick Google of his very unique name pulls up his profile on a competitive frisbee golf tournament database, other results show his placing in a bike race and his profile on alltrails (a hiking app). It's now basically obvious to me what's going on and my suspicions are all but confirmed. However I choose not to confront her right away. The next morning she tells me she ordered breakfast from a nearby diner on DoorDash (eggs, bacon, and hashbrowns). The same diner that he used to work at and that I recall her once telling me they used to go to frequently. I checked the credit card that she has attached to her DoorDash account and found many other DoorDash charges, but none for that diner. Someone else clearly bought breakfast. At this point I'm losing my mind but I don't want to get in a huge argument while in separate cities so I wait. When she finally gets home I wait for a lull in the conversation and calmly ask her if she can explain the YewTewb history. She immediately acts offended and says I'm being weird and runs off to the other room to “take a work call” no idea if she actually had to. She texts me that she can't believe I would bring that up to her while she was trying to work even though we were hanging out on the patio doing nothing when I brought it up. I waited almost a half hour for the right time to talk about it. She then begins to text me excuses about how her YewTewb probably ""autoplayed"" the content. When I mentioned that she doesn't have autoplay on she said ""sometimes it still does.""  This is also obviously complete bullshit because all the channels that were being watched showed up in the search history as well as the watch history and were niche interest videos that would never just start autoplaying in her algorithm anyway even if autoplay was on. She then tries suggesting that her YewTewb account must be logged in in some hotel room somewhere and claims that she logged out all devices and changed her password. I know this isn't true because her account is still logged in on my TV to this day. Furthermore, she uses a chromecast dongle at hotels so she doesn't have to worry about logging in every app every time. Even furthermore, she stays at Marriot hotels which log out your TV apps automatically on checkout. Even further furthermore, I scrolled the watch history all the way back as far as I could. It shows a distinct pattern of chunks of this guy's interests followed by weeks of her normal music videos she watches followed by another chunk of his content (from some of the same creators) followed by more of her normal stuff followed by another chunk of his stuff. It's so clear that this is not the activity you would see from a YewTewb account that has been somehow logged in on a hotel TV for months with new guests coming through every night. This is him watching shit back at the hotel room while she works and it happened on every work trip she's had this summer.

Eventually (after running out of excuses that make any sense) she freaks out about how I'm insinuating that she's cheating and she divorces me via text and drives off refusing to look at me. I call her and she's in a complete state of meltdown and hangs up on me after driving the wrong direction down a one way street. She then proceeds to stay at her best friend's house for 2 days, takes our kids out of town to her mom's for 3 days, then by the time she's back she has an apartment lined up to move into within 5 days. Within 3 days of moving out she bought a new car, got a new dog, and got new tattoos. Meanwhile during this move out process she's telling me things like she “will always hold out hope for us"", she “thinks she could come back"", and she “still wants to do things together as a family"".

During the week between her decision to move out and actually being able to get into her apartment we had a couples counseling session that we had booked before she made that decision. We decided to still go because at the very least we will be co-parenting for the next 16 years together. In that session she continued to lie to the therapist and had a (maybe fake?) panic attack that derailed much of the conversation. She would not even allow me to get through the re-seat portion of the story for nearly a half bour. Eventually, when I finally started to dial up the pressure and grill her about her DoorDash order having no transaction she continued to lie even then. I confronted her and said ""would you be willing to pull out your phone and show me your DoorDash order history?"" she got flustered and refused. She then told me again she wanted a divorce and then furiously stomped out before the session was over. Minutes later, unprompted, she provided me with a screenshot of a credit card statement for the card attached to her DoorDash account that showed a $57 charge to a pizza restaurant from the night of her work trip. This is my credit card and the statement she showed me was the one I had already been looking at which caused my suspicion in the first place. She claimed that this charge for pizza was actually the diner transaction but that the price was correct and that it just posted as the wrong restaurant ""for some reason."" This place just happens to be a high end pizza restaurant that she really likes. So her story is that she ordered eggs, bacon, and hashbrowns for one, it cost $57, and it posted as the wrong restaurant that just so happens to be one that she really likes. Call me crazy but I think it's probably more likely that she bought the pizza the night before and he took care of breakfast the next morning. When I asked why she was willing to show the credit card statement but not simply her order history in the DoorDash app she said it was because ""she couldn't log into DoorDash""  and ""she had bad service in an alley."" When I asked if she could show me it now that she had service and could log in (because the order history certainly wouldn't show the wrong restaurant, it would show what you ordered down to whether or not you wanted utensils) she said she would not show me simply because “she shouldn't have to keep proving herself innocent"" and her friend agreed that she shouldn't share it. She then proceeded to tell me she was done talking about it and would only be talking with me about the kids from then on.

In retrospect there were so many clues. Squeezing in Brazilian waxes the day of her work trips that just couldn't be put off. Huge arguments with threats of divorce that always seemed to happen a day or two after she returned from a trip. Doing full hair and makeup to drive to a hotel room and then "" go to bed early” just to have to do it again in the morning before the work obligation. A new 8 digit passcode on her phone and tablet. A $52 charge for Thai food takeout where she claimed to have ordered 2 entrees both with extra meat and veggies. Finding excuses to stop in her (and her ex boyfriend’s) hometown on the way in and out of the bigger city she would be working in. I assume she also shut down her personal credit card as soon as I asked to become an authorized user claiming it was due to fraud. They didn't just send her a new card though, the account was just completely closed by the time mine arrived in the mail so I couldn't view any transactions. Most of all though I should have been more aware of how she was fully willing to provide transparency and evidence in some situations but in others simply asking would result in divorce threats. Showing her Fitbit sleep data, installed apps, messaging history, location history… None of that was a problem because she knew nothing in there would be incriminating. She showed it all with little resistance. But when I suggested we request security footage, make a call about the re-seat to escalate the issue, or simply show me a DoorDash order it's immediate threats of divorce. It's so clear when she knows what she would show would get her busted.

I was with this woman for nearly all of my adult life. We were extremely close and best friends. We did lots of things together and had what I believed to be a great marriage. I was very happy. I am currently the stay at home dad until my kids are both in school and now I'm scrambling to find a backup plan now that she moved out. I don't understand how she could do this to me or the family. She knows that I know and she can't even be honest about it. I assume this must be because she simply can't live with the shame. The shame of betraying me, the shame of breaking up our family, the shame of lying to her family, and the shame of acting in a way that doesn't align with the person she presents to the world. Both our kids are messed up by this and regressing in their behavior and it makes me so angry I am unable to even want to look at her, however I have to communicate with her every day about this kids. Meanwhile she's complaining that I'm not in a good enough mood in front of the kids during drop offs or that it makes her sad that I would rather she not show up at our kids activities when it's my day to have them. Her texts have a fake enthusiasm about them with exclamation points and I just don't even know what to make of it. How am I ever going to move on having to co-parent with this woman who I no longer even recognize. She was the person in the world I trusted most and now she's acting like this betrayal didn't even happen and just moving on with a new life. Meanwhile she's telling her entire side of the family that I'm the one who caused this by being paranoid and refusing to move forward. Any help from anyone who has dealt with a betrayal like this would be so appreciated. Also to anyone who has made it this far, please tell me what you think about the evidence I have found. Everyone in my personal life that I have confided in about this has been convinced that this is all exactly what it looks like. However, the gaslighting has done serious damage to me and has me questioning my sense of reality. Hearing people tell me I am not crazy is surprisingly healing. Thank you so much for taking the time to read my ramblings.

TLDR: Partner of 13 years in all likelihood is having an affair but won't admit to it despite overwhelming evidence. She is claiming that the split is my fault for not trusting her enough and not being willing to simply ignore what I have found and move forward with her. She moved out abruptly leaving me financially strained and started a new life. I now have to co-parent with her for a long time with no closure on what happened and where our relationship fell apart. I can't believe this is my life. I was so happy. I don't know how I'll ever get over this being the end of my marriage and I need help.

Update: Since the separation more evidence has piled up that basically proves her guilt. This is stuff I could confront her with that I don't see how she could deny but I haven't done it yet and I'm not sure there's any point.

The first involves her credit card. I mentioned previously that she had one credit card that I wasn't an authorized user on (this was the one she used to buy the bier). I figured there was probably a lot more incriminating information on this card and I was curious as to how she would react if I asked her to be an authorized user on it. So before we separated I asked her with the reasoning being that I needed to add it to our budgeting app. Even though she was extremely reluctant to agree to authorize me I think she felt like she had no choice without looking suspicious. After all, she's an authorized user on ALL my cards. So she added me and then within 15 minutes she showed me a screenshot of a train ticket purchased on the card that she claimed must have been bought fraudulently after getting compromised on a gas station skimmer. (I love the idea of a guy getting ahold of stolen credit card info and then buying a single $32 train ticket with it and nothing more.) But the most suspicious part of this was that the charge was from the month before and she said she only looked at the transactions to see if the bier charge actually went through. Why did she look at the previous month? Pulling that up requires loading a completely separate statement page and there would be no reason to suddenly start looking through old transactions right after authorizing me. At the time I reluctantly accepted this because I couldn't come up with a good reason as to why there would be a train ticket on her credit card so I dropped it. But by the time my card arrived in the mail her card had already been shut down and she claimed the credit card company did this as a result of the fraud. It was a 10 year old account. Her oldest account. It impacted her age of credit history. I can't think of any company that would handle a simple fraud case by closing an account without the customer's permission. She also made no attempt to fight this decision. Extremely fishy. Anyway a month or so after she moved out I got a notification from the Credit Karma app telling me I had a certain number of closed accounts and saying I could view them. One of them was her credit card because I was authorized. In the details for reason of account closure it said “account closed by consumer"" and the date closed was the same date as the final date the credit card was paid. So she made me an authorized user, made up some bullshit about fraud, then paid the card off and closed it on the same day before I could ever view a transaction. As for the train ticket, a round trip ticket from her ex boyfriend's hometown to where we live costs the exact amount of the charge. She also told me in our therapy session that she had called him to confess her abortion and found out that he's still an alcoholic and has no car which I guess was her reason why the affair was impossible? Certainly a good reason to have to buy the guy a train ticket. I also couldn't help but chuckle at the thought of that conversation, she just calls him up out of the blue after 15 years to confess an abortion and he decides to just tell her about his alcoholism and lack of car? Ridiculous.

The second major piece of evidence is that her YewTewb account remains logged in at my house to this day and she has no idea even nearly 3 months later. She claimed she had changed her password and deleted all attached devices but apparently not. The watch and search history continues to be the same type of shit that I had found before the separation and it started showing up within like a week of her moving out. Since then it continues to reliably show up in her watch history but only on days when I have the kids. On days when she has the kids there's practically no activity or it's all things that she or our kids would watch. Her algorithm looks like a dude's but she's still using it so she can make no possible excuse that she doesn't know what's going on here.

What do I do about this? I've documented all this evidence and I could confront her with everything but I assume she would still just shamelessly deny it and possibly get hostile in the divorce. I'm also worried about her mental health and ability to keep it together as a mom considering my kids are with her half the time. She has mentioned suicide in the past. Do I just bury this? Is it even worth it to confront her just for my own justice? It feels awful to hold it all in and let her continue to walk around acting like the victim. She has also been complaining about my demeanor during drop offs and has no idea the level to which I know she is bullshitting me. She told me she “has been shocked at how unwilling I have been to co-parent respectfully"" with her. I have basically gone no contact and avoid speaking to her or even looking at her when we have to cross paths. I didn't even go to my daughter's birthday, I just celebrated separately with her. It's so infuriating to have her acting like I'm the one acting out of line. I really just have no clue how to proceed. A part of me thinks I need to wait until papers are signed to confront her, another part of me wants to do it immediately, yet another part thinks I should just bury it and do my best to stop thinking about her. It's incredibly hard to deal with kid drop offs/pick ups and the day to day discussions about the kids lives with this knowledge looming over me all the time. What do I do? Thanks for reading.

1hmjat6,https://i.redd.it/nww4nqpu859e1.jpeg,How much do motion graphics cost?,"""Motion Graphics Pricing: It’s Not Just Click, Drag, and Boom!""


---

🎬 “How Much for a Little Motion?” 🎬
You know, people often approach motion designers with the confidence of someone ordering a sandwich. “I just need a little animation—maybe like 30 seconds. How much could that be? $50?” Oh, sweet summer child, if only creating motion graphics was as simple as slapping mustard on bread! Truth is, pricing motion graphics is more like pricing a wedding. Sure, you can do it cheaply, but you’re probably not getting the 3D cake and fireworks finale.


---

💻 “Tools Don’t Pay Rent” 💻
Let’s talk tools for a second. Animators work with software like After Effects, Blender, or Cinema 4D—not exactly free apps on your phone. These are premium tools, and they require years of training to master. It's like asking a chef to cook you a five-star meal and then wondering why it costs more than a microwave dinner. Spoiler: it’s not the stove; it’s the skill.


---

📈 “But It’s Just a Few Moving Shapes!” 📈
Ah, the famous “just a few shapes” line. Let me explain something. Behind those moving shapes are hours of storyboarding, keyframing, rendering, revisions, and the occasional existential crisis. If motion designers got paid for every time someone said “just,” they’d have yachts instead of laptops.


---

🕒 “Time is Money—and Deadlines Are Wildcards” 🕒
Here’s a fun fact: the faster you want it, the more expensive it gets. You can’t expect a 24-hour turnaround without paying the “emergency surgery fee.” Motion design is not a McDrive-thru. You want a rush job? Sure—but that means the designer cancels their weekend plans and starts chugging coffee like it’s life support.


---

💎 “Customization Costs More Than a Big Mac” 💎
Now, if you want a fully custom animation—unique branding, 3D elements, sound design—that’s a whole different ballgame. Custom doesn’t mean “a little tweak here and there.” It means brainstorming, creating assets, and giving your project that Hollywood-level flair. Don’t be shocked if the price is closer to a used car than a combo meal.


---

📊 “So, What’s the Verdict?” 📊
The short answer: it depends. A basic explainer might be $1,000 to $3,000. A high-end 3D commercial? Easily $10,000 or more. Think of it like tailoring: the more intricate the design, the higher the price. But remember, motion graphics aren’t just “costs”—they’re investments. They make your brand stand out and bring ROI faster than static ads ever could.


---

🎤 “Mic Drop… But Smoothly Animated” 🎤
So next time you think, “How much could motion graphics really cost?” remember this: quality animation isn’t cheap, and cheap animation isn’t quality. And hey, if you want something unforgettable, it’s worth paying for the pros who can make it happen.

Hit me up if you want a quote or just need to talk about why “just a little animation” is never just anything!

1hmja5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/1hmja5g/the_gender_alarm_at_neutral_grounds/,The Gender Alarm at Neutral Grounds,"In the heart of Seattle's Ballard neighborhood, a trendy new store called **""Neutral Grounds""** opened its doors. A combination coffee shop, bookstore, and gluten-free churro stand, it had one rule that set it apart: **“No Gendered Language Allowed.”**  

The rule was posted in big block letters at the entrance. Beneath it, a disclaimer read: “This includes, but is not limited to: ‘sir,’ ‘ma’am,’ ‘bro,’ ‘dude,’ ‘guys,’ ‘ladies,’ and any other terms that may perpetuate the binary. Let’s get creative, folks!”  

Locals were intrigued. Some entered cautiously, scanning the room for potential linguistic landmines. Others embraced the challenge, eager to prove their wokeness. But for one poor newcomer, a man named Dave, this policy turned into a linguistic nightmare.  

Dave had just moved from Spokane, where everyone was a ""buddy"" or ""pal."" As he approached the counter, a cheerful barista with a name tag that read **“Cloud (they/them)”** greeted him.  

“What can I get for you, friend?” Cloud asked with an encouraging smile.  

Dave, flustered, stammered, “Uh, thanks, ma’am—I mean, uh, person? Human? Uh, individual?”  

Cloud’s smile tightened. A small chime sounded from behind the counter. It was the **“Gender Alarm,”** a soft gong that Neutral Grounds used to gently remind customers of their mistakes.  

“Oh no!” Dave panicked. “I—I didn’t mean anything by it! I’m just trying to order a coffee, uh, respected entity!”  

The entire café turned to look at him. A toddler in the corner dropped their churro. A person knitting a scarf nodded disapprovingly. A giant poster on the wall, which read **“Words Matter”**, seemed to glare down at him.  

“You’re fine,” Cloud said, trying to keep the peace. “But next time, maybe just use something neutral, like ‘friend,’ ‘comrade,’ or even ‘citizen.’”  

“Got it,” Dave replied, sweating. “I’ll take a black coffee, uh, citizen. No, wait—comrade! No, no, *friend*! Yeah, friend.”  

Cloud nodded approvingly and rang up the order. But as Dave fumbled for his wallet, disaster struck again. His change clattered to the floor, and in a moment of instinct, he called out to another customer, “Hey man, could you grab that for me?”  

The Gender Alarm went off louder this time. The café collectively gasped. A person reading a book titled *“Deconstructing the Patriarchy in 5 Easy Steps”* dropped their latte.  

Dave raised his hands in surrender. “I’m sorry! I’m new here!”  

Cloud sighed, slid the coffee across the counter, and whispered, “Look, you’ve got potential, but maybe just... avoid talking until you get the hang of it.”  

Dave nodded and retreated to a corner table. As he sipped his coffee, he overheard a spirited debate between two customers over whether “dude” could be rebranded as a gender-neutral term. He realized he had a lot to learn.  

By the time Dave left Neutral Grounds, he wasn’t sure if he’d conquered the art of gender-neutral speech, but he did know one thing: his next coffee would come with a side of silence.",0,1735197351.0,SeattleWA,2,0.21,False

A couple days ago he told me he hadn’t gotten me anything for christmas, but I fooled myself into thinking that maybe he’d just gotten me a bar of supermarket chocolate or a nice t-shirt and wanted me to think he hadn’t gotten anything when he secretly did. 

Spoiler alert: he did not. I would have been perfectly happy with a 2€ chocolate bar. Or even a coffee. But no, he really did get me nothing. For added context he spent the whole of December finding the perfect gifts for his family members. 

We did some last minute gift shopping on New Year’s eve and he considered buying me a candle but then changed his mind, as he’d gotten his sibling a candle and didn’t want them to be jealous/bummed out that I got a “fancier” one. 

He got from me a new phone as his old one was 6+ years old and very laggy, and a yeti water bottle because his old one is just quite beaten. (It’s yet to arrive due to delays).

I feel a little … bummed out? that he just forgot to find anything for me. It makes me feel like an afterthought/not that important to him. 
I don’t know how to approach this with him as I feel crazy for even feeling upset.

1hmj50h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hmj50h/aitah_for_not_joining_friends_for_their_evening/,AITAH for not joining friends for their evening plan during vacation?,"To give a background, my husband loves spending time with others and I am opposite, I like my me time as well. If I don’t feel like doing anything I share it with others and proceed to do my own thing. My husband is opposite. Even if he is tired, if someone would call him he would happily go. 

Coming to the incident, this is the first time when I am travelling with a group of 8 people for 6 days. We are friends for years and everyone is comfortable with each other. We spend almost every weekend together. Can be in a group of 4,6 or 8.  

We wake up at 5 AM for a morning flight and reached the destination where all of us agreed to wake up at 4 AM to see sunrise at Matterhorn mountain as it needed to travel for 3 hours. 

After having lunch, we thought to leave for the hotel after spending 1-2 hours in the market.

Everyone was making some stops at souvenir shops or coffee shops etc (things that interested them) and I wanted to roam around and see most of it as I knew we had limited time there. I was sharing where I was in the group chat as well so they don’t wonder where we are and if they are interested, they can join as well.

My husband started saying he is tired, so I asked him to wait with others and I can come back in some time. After a small argument, we came back as it already ruined my mood. And when we came back friends were still discussing if they want to roam around further. I told it was beautiful and another friend also. wanted to go to a small bridge so we went there as a group. And then my husband didn’t complain about being tired.

After coming back to the hotel around 6 PM, I wanted to have a relaxed evening in my room. And friends made plans to come together in one of their rooms and have drinks and pizza. I told my husband to go ahead and I will stay and relax in the room. 
 
He was upset when he left. I told him that I could have understood his anger if I had stopped him from going but it is my vacation too where I want to relax as well. 

He is of the thought that if we came in a group, we should be part of every activity together. And I said, I am part of each activity throughout the day and for some time I also would need my time. I make sure that I am not distributing the overall plan. And I am not even arguing over what needs to be done. Whatever people are deciding, I am going with it. But I need some time for myself as well. Else I won’t be enjoy the 6 days vacation with 8 people.

1hmj4ho,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hmj4ho,Makes a random and cryptic IG post on 12/11/24… ignores all the comments lol. ,"“the_daily_cuppa_jo I had an errand to run this morning and had the pleasure of visiting a little diner. This diner had coffee mugs that were a too small for me, but it had the feel of going back to a simpler time. Hot coffee, made cool with the four half and half creamers, in a thick ceramic cup felt nice in the hands. The matching little plate felt like it hadn't been modernized in years but held older charm.
Life is changing, you can't escape it. But places like that diner, with the plates and mugs that haven't been updated in years, you get somewhere that remains the same.
Places like that are wonderful to visit, but only to visit. You can't stay trapped in nostalgia, life changes and those changes can feel bad at times but all of those moments that are negative do have a positive change on you. At least, this is what I believe. Hard things that you go through can and do make you stronger. Able to handle more and help others going something similar. So you can enjoy the past, places like that diner that feels like it's standing still in an ocean of nostalgia, but don't stay there.
You have a whole life to live. :)”",1,1735196607.0,Dailycuppajo,0,1.0,False
1hmj41f,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/1hmj41f/neurodivergent_proud_the_rise_of_the_seattle/,Neurodivergent & Proud: The Rise of the Seattle Identity Trend,"In Seattle, the trend began like all things do—quietly and with an ironic sense of self-awareness. It started with a single post in a local Facebook group titled *“I'm Neurodivergent—But Make It Pacific Northwest™”*. The post had a picture of a man in a Patagonia jacket, sipping kombucha on a vintage bicycle, with the caption: *""Just realizing I’m neurodivergent in a way that really complements my vibe.""*

And just like that, it took off. 

Within weeks, ""neurodivergent"" became the latest identity trend in Seattle, almost like a new Starbucks drink. Everyone wanted a sip of it, and they didn’t care whether they knew what it actually meant.

At first, it was subtle. “I’m ADHD,” one woman declared while waiting in line at a coffee shop. “I can’t focus on ordering, so I just let the barista choose for me. *Such a mood*.” She posted a picture of her oat milk latte with the caption, *“Unmedicated but thriving.”*

Then, it went next-level. “Neurodivergent and Proud,” one guy posted, wearing a beanie, holding a spiral-bound notebook, and standing in front of a mural of a sloth. “I think it’s just my brain, but I’m *pretty sure* I have synesthesia because I get emotional whenever I see matcha powder.” 

Seattle’s coffee shops became the new headquarters for this growing movement. People gathered at cafés to discuss their “neurodivergence,” where “working memory” was a hot topic, and “hyperfixation” was a badge of honor. It wasn’t about being diagnosed anymore—it was about what kind of neurodivergent you were. The more obscure, the better.

“Yeah, I’m probably on the spectrum,” one person would say while sipping their nitro cold brew. “Like, in a *sensory-seeking* way, though. I can’t deal with loud noises, but I’m *really into* crunching things, like chips. It’s a whole sensory experience.”

By now, the Seattleites had formed a unique subculture, one where “neurodivergent” was less about mental health and more about personal branding. You could spot them easily: they wore noise-canceling headphones in public, carried stress balls in their pockets, and were always just a *little* too into essential oils.

The ""Neurodivergent in Seattle"" meetups were full of people explaining how their “cognitive quirks” made them unique. “I’m dyslexic,” one woman proclaimed at a local pub, “but I like to think of it as just having a different operating system. Like, I’m an Apple product in a Windows world.” 

It wasn’t long before the more niche “neurodivergent” terms were being invented. People started identifying as “hyperempathetic,” claiming that they could feel everyone else’s emotions, especially if the emotions were linked to the scent of lavender or a specific type of granola.

But, as with all trends, there was pushback. One evening at a vegan pop-up dinner, a woman stood up and exclaimed, “I’m *so* neurotypical, and proud of it!” The room fell silent. People looked at her like she had just said, “I still get my coffee from Starbucks” in the middle of an artisan pour-over shop.

“Wait, you don’t feel *the sensory overload* of the light fixtures in here?” someone asked, sipping their oat milk latte with a worried expression.

“Not at all,” the woman said. “I actually like it. It’s just a nice, calming place to hang out.”

The group gasped. “You can *feel* calm? Ugh, you’re so mainstream,” one person muttered, their fidget spinner clicking impatiently.

It wasn’t long before local therapists got in on the action, offering “Neurodivergent 101” workshops. “Are you feeling a little too *out of the box*?” the flyer would read. “Let’s find your true neurodivergent self! Bring your journal, essential oils, and a sense of unfiltered authenticity.”

The tipping point came during the Seattle Pride Parade when a float labeled “Neurodivergence is a Spectrum” rolled through. People waved flags with phrases like, “I’m Autistic—And Also A Barista,” “ADHD, But Make It Fashion,” and “Sensory Overload: Not Just For Kids Anymore!”

The float was a massive hit—until someone complained that the glitter was too loud. It turns out, there’s a fine line between “neurodivergent and proud” and “neurodivergent and need some peace and quiet.”

Eventually, Seattle’s trend of identifying as neurodivergent settled into its own rhythm. People still wore their quirks like badges of honor, but now they were more focused on “intellectual self-care” than wearing noise-canceling headphones everywhere they went.

It had become, as all things in Seattle eventually do, another layer of identity to be explored, curated, and posted about endlessly online. And hey, at least it was better than another “craft beer” phase.",0,1735196553.0,SeattleWA,7,0.34,False

1. If adding another variable will make it difficult to make a good cup of coffee

2. If roasting is difficult to meet standard of a commercial roaster thus the effort and cost make it not worth it. 

3. If shywalker V2 is a good machine to start with

4. If green beans are readily available. (I am based in Malaysia)

It started early, I was up around 8am..ish. And did my usual morning bits like teeth etc. And then we did presents! With croissants and orange juice and coffee. Tradition. Our only tradition. I remember when I was like 8 or 9 and at school we had to write a thing about our family traditions at Christmas and we had none so I made one up and said my nana always brought along a big wheel of cheese. Like ??? I’ve never admitted that to anyone. It still pops into my head every month or so and I internally cringe. Anyway, so we did presents. I got a fancy mug, a linen orby light shade for my ceiling bedroom light (!!), a cushion cover, two books, a book mark and a lil weeding tool. I gave mum a Fitbit, a big jigsaw puzzle and a leather sunglasses pouch. And dad’s presents are en route/at home so he has Christmas in January too. And then we got up to do chores. We carried the big heavy slab of wood for the tressel in from the garage as well as the sofa, we moved furniture and the other sofa around, we prepped the food, I wrapped all of mums presents for everyone, I cleaned the table and chairs outside, I picked flowers from the garden and dad said to steal some hydrangeas from the shrub across the road not someone’s garden but I felt like a criminal but then decided you’re only a criminal if you get caught and decided to get some but made dad come with me and then got ready like shower and stuff. It was a very busy Christmas morning. 

And then people started arriving around 1pm and I kept making the salads and dressings and sauces etc which I liked and asked to do because it gives me a task so I can be doing something while talking to someone and means I can stay in the kitchen til I feel comfier and so that works well I guess. And then the kids arrived and I chatted with them and then we all had lunch and there was shredded/pulled lamb with pomegranate and yoghurt/tahini stuff on top of roasted veggies with bulgur wheat and pomegranate seeds mixed in as well as ham - so the stuff I didn’t eat. And there was a deliciously fresh and crunchy but creamy cucumber, avocado, mint and parsley salad which I could have eaten a truckload of. There was a leafy green salad and another green salad that was more herby. There were new potatoes - such a weird name? - which were lemony/buttery/herby. There was my quiche. There was a Lebanese eggplant dish with pomegranate and yoghurty sauce on it from my brothers step dad as he’s Lebanese, I think he’s so nice but my brother doesn’t like him much? So weird to me. Anyway I think that was everything? There were ten of us all at one big long table which was nice, albeit slightly cramped. 

And then we all did presents and my niece wanted to be Santa and hand them out but then she made me do it with her so I was Mrs Claus apparently and handed presents out with her to everyone. I got some nice dish cloths, a mini desk calendar thing and a soft toy. I was kind of disappointed in the presents but oh well, I don’t even know why as I wasn’t expecting much at all but I think it’s just I felt I had given more than I received which tbh is whatever but I didn’t really get thank yous which would have been nice and also I got a soft toy from my niece which was technically from my brother/SIL etc but actually from my niece but I got them a present each? It just made me feel… silly. And spoilt, tbh. I don’t like how I felt disappointed, that’s not how I should feel as an *adult* who made a decison that she would rather give nice gifts than nothing or something tiiiiny. So it was my own choice and the expected outcome and yet I still felt let down. So I’m disappointed in myself for that. I’m talking as if it was a major disappointment and it wasn’t, it just felt kind of eh. Anyway. 

Then I played with the kids - jenga and drawing and chatting - and then we went for a walk with pups to take nature pictures with their new cameras - like $5 immediate print out ones - and I taught them to take photos looking up at trees and my niece kept saying THIS IS SOO COOL I LOVE TAKING PICTURES LOOKING UP which was funny and she took photos of everything and said everything was so cool and she reminded me of how I was as a kid as I was like that too. It was raining too so we were out wandering around in the rain but it was quite nice. I didn’t spend any time much with the adults as my niece is kind of demanding but also idk how to say this but I’d rather hang out with them anyway as opposed to the adults. I like the older adults, I just don’t like think I like my brother and his wife much. 

And then they all left around 7:30pm, which was fine and normally I wouldn’t think much of it but I was *done* by around 5. I was just emotionally and mentally drained, physically tired too but more so the other two. I just felt so overstimulated I guess, just like I was running on empty and I felt near tears a couple of times. I didn’t let it show but I knew I was near breaking. Like in the evening dad took some food to his friend a short drive away but like half an hour earlier he said mum should do it as her had a couple g&t’s and then mum was busy so dad said he’d go and I said no you can’t and they both said well it’s fine as the g&t’s were a few hours ago etc but I just felt really on edge and had to leave the room/hide in the bathroom for a few minutes to get it together. I think it didn’t help I’ve been worrying this could be my last Christmas with dad and so that stressy moment over driving made me really over the edge anxious when I was already at tipping point. And for everyone to be watching at the table as I said but you shouldn’t drive you said you wouldn’t and for mum and dad to be like no it’s fine and having everyone looking at me made it worse. So he left and I made it maybe 30 seconds before going to the bathroom as I couldn’t leave right away as it would make it obvious I was upset. And then I also felt it later on too. Anyway. It was just a taxing day, everything went well I think I just struggled a lot more internally than I normally might. I don’t think it was an easy day for me despite everything going well. I’m tearing up now writing it and my throats all choked up. Why do I have to be like this? 

Anyway I cleaned the whole kitchen twice during the day as I hate how messy and cluttered it can get it stresses me out. And then I cleaned it again in the evening. And then I cleaned it again this morning. 

I had some nice compliments yesterday, I was called “radiant” and I said oh no thank you but it’s just makeup as I had a lil bit on but they kept saying “no no you’re so beautiful and so radiant” and then I said oh well no but thank you and changed the subject as I was awkward and started worrying I looked even haggard than I thought I did and it was a joke or they were saying it because I so clearly wasn’t looking nice. I think the “radiance” was actually a slight sheen of sweat anyway, reaaaaaal cute. I felt really uncomfy at times too, I wasn’t wearing a super cleavagy top but I mean it wasn’t high cut either anyway I felt so gross and awkward because I could see my nephew looking at my boobs and stuff like DUDE F OFF YOURE RELATED TO ME ?!? Is that normal? I know he’s 11 so is probably noticing stuff now I guess but still, FIND SOMEONE ELSE. I know it’s nothing but still, can he please just stay a cute kid forever :( Anyway the other compliment was about my choice in placement of all the art bits and pieces around the house by my SIL who studied art history and my brothers mum who was a senior art history lecturer at a university and both were telling my dad how well I placed each piece for the space in the room and surroundings and that I had a “real eye” which seems BS to me like it’s a white room and we only hung a handful of things but it felt nice to hear nonetheless. 

I missed Andy a lot during the day. A **lot**. He was messaging me and things like we were chatting about our day and whatnot but I just felt empty without him. It sounded like he had a lovely Christmas Day, although my poor baby was unwell the night prior and in the morning a bit too. He had Christmas morning at his mums which sounded nice, his mum sounds so lovely like how she did the whole Christmas dinner for them and the stockings and idk, I love that he has such loving parents. And then he went to have lunch with his dad at a restaurant and the food sounded *insane*. Wowowow. And him saying the name of the lil cakes? I can’t say it here as it’s my name but I love how my name sounds coming out of his mouth, it made me smiley. Sometimes I wish I went by my full first name not the shortened version. And then he had a nap at his dads which is so cute? Idk why? But it is? Everything he does is so cute. In a hot way. 

And then we watched some mad men and chatted and then went to sleep. I’m glad I got to end the day with him. I honestly love him so deeply it physically aches.

Annnnnnd now to today. Boxing Day! I can finally relax! There is nothing to be done! Hallelujah! 

It’s currently 12:42pm. I woke up from my dozey state to my honey calling me, I was semi-dreaming about him when he called and it gave me major butterflies going from dream state Andy to real life Andy, like a literal dream come true. In my dream he was with me and my main memories of the dream was me hugging him like my arms wrapped tight around his middle and head resting on his chest and him holding me and kissing my head - I know I’m too tall for that irl but it was nice anyway - and then also he was helping me choose a collar for a Labrador puppy - and then in our chat later he talked about a white Labrador!!!! Weird, no? Anyway he’s just everything to me, utterly *everything*. 

I don’t know what to do today. I mean I do, absolutely nothing. So far I have had a croissant and some juice and journaled and cleaned the kitchen. Now I think I will look at some Boxing Day sales before getting into a new book :) 

I’ve really not done anything today. I lazed about on the sofa with pups, chatted with Andy, took pups for a very quick rainy walk, chatted with dad and that’s about it. I also had a midday shower because I wanted one as I just love my showers but thought no don’t do that it’s too much and then I thought f it it’s Boxing Day and I’m allowed two showers today if I please. So that was nice. 

Oh my GOD. He sent me a photo of him and his dad at Christmas lunch yesterday and holy f’ing hell my honey is HANDSOME. This is not news to me, I’ve always known he’s hot but smsvsvahgs jfc. I couldn’t stop zooming in and out in and out like a little pervert, but he’s so yum. He’s so easy to fall in love with? How is it so easy?! How is he so wonderful? I feel like Alice when she falls into Wonderland down that rabbit hole and the end destination is my limit in how much I can love him, except it’s actually never ending. His glasses suit him so well, he’s still not super confident about them but I hope he starts to learn how good he looks in them. They really suit him so well. He said they’re not the ones I picked but I thought they were?! They’re very similar if not. Also his hands. His haaannnndddssssssss. The day they’re all over me and inside me is the day I will have reached peak bliss. Okay I’ll stop before I stop being sweet and lovey and become a filthy slut. Baby. Baby baby babyyyyy. And all mine. Luckiest girl. 

I didn’t read anything today. I wanted to but I just didn’t have it in me to start something so I just milled about doing sweet f all throughout the day. Tomorrow, perhaps? I need to also do some sales shopping because I need new shoes. I want to see if I can get a pedicure while I’m out here too. Maybe a lil closer to the end of my holiday though? I need to find my summer bucket list in my notes. 

I really want to get a 2025 planner notebook but I also feel like why waste $80? I never used them? But also maybe this year will be different…? But does me buying one again just provide further evidence of my descent into insanity? Hm.

On that mentally unstable note, I’ve started weaning off my current meds today. Four days of zilch and then I start back on the old ones at lowest dose and presumably build up.  I’m a little nervous to be weaning off now, as I do tend to struggle internally come end of year and all my feelings of failure get exacerbated and all but also I need to not be weaning off and starting afresh when I go back to work either so idk. Now feels the best time so now it shall be. Let’s hope it goes well.

1hmiyv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hmiyv1/speak_your_feelings_when_you_have_the_chance/,"Speak your feelings when you have the chance, there may not be another","Lately, I’ve been reflecting on my past relationships—both friendships and romantic ones. I have never had fleeting connections; they always last long enough for me to learn something real about the other person. I’ve been trying to remember what each of them felt like.

I’ve always viewed my life as a kind of adventure, forging ahead and learning new things on my own terms. That didn’t leave much room to stick with people who saw life differently and didn’t want to walk hand in hand. And yet, I’ve always craved a sense of belonging—a place to call home. Two against the world.

When I look back at the relationship that brought me to Romania, I don’t recall much tender feeling, apart from some wistful nostalgia: we were friends, playing little games, talking about random stuff. I know I pretty much left my whole life behind to come to her, changed my views drastically, adapted to a completely new environment.

But to me, it was still part of my own adventure—just a means to an end. When she broke up with me, I was devastated. Not because I loved her deeply (though she was a dear friend), but because the relationship didn’t end on my terms. By that point, I had already been thinking of leaving. I didn’t believe she could give me what I truly wanted in life.

I came to realize the same dynamic repeated itself in all my relationships. I never truly loved.

Everything really changed this year, though, when I unexpectedly met someone who turned out to be incredibly important. At first, we couldn’t stand each other—she thought I was arrogant and judgmental, and I found her awkward and narrow-minded.

Not exactly a recipe for success, right?

But somehow, over the following two months, we stayed in touch and managed to smooth out our differences. We grew around each other. We talked through everything, discussing what we disliked about each other and how we could fix it. We’re both very set in our ways, but we genuinely tried to see things through each other’s eyes.

We were so different, yet we became closer than anyone—very quickly. We traveled a bit, spent amazing nights just cuddling, woke each other up for morning coffee, took ridiculously long walks, played tennis, watched Comedy Central. More importantly, we took care of each other selflessly, never expecting anything in return.

We were genuinely happy to see each other every time; our smiles couldn’t have been brighter. Suddenly, this country—and the whole world—felt like the best place to be.

And that’s when I finally understood what love is. It’s not a spark, not common interests, definitely not physical appearance (though I never believed it was all about that). It’s the loyalty and willingness to work through differences, keeping the other person’s happiness firmly in mind.

That feeling is so clear to remember.

Fast-forward to the end of November. We’d just returned from Italy—Bologna and Florence. We ate tons of gelato, walked countless steps, and visited ancient buildings. We couldn’t have been happier.

A few days later, she developed a weird rash all over her body. At first, we didn’t think much of it, and neither did the doctors we visited in Bucharest. They said it was a simple allergy and that a few pills should clear it up. Naturally, we relaxed.

But soon, the rash came with excruciating muscle pain, bad enough that she could hardly walk. She started running a fever, developed a sore throat, sweated profusely, and lost her appetite.

We ended up at Victor Babeș Hospital for infectious diseases. After a week there, she was sent home without a diagnosis—just a recommendation to see a rheumatologist. I wanted us to stay, but she was extremely stressed. She’d gained 12 kg in just six days and wanted a couple of days at home first, despite her suffering.

Little did I know that two days later, I’d be living the worst nightmare of my life.

That day, she felt a lot worse. I stayed by her side, bought her pills, checked her temperature, helped her drink water, changed blankets, and talked to her. Around 8 p.m., she said she was very tired and going to sleep.

Over the next few hours, she got up a couple of times to use the toilet, chat with me briefly, kiss me, and tell me she felt awful.

Then the nightmare truly began.

Around 11:30 p.m., I realized something was really wrong. She was cold, her body shook periodically, she thrashed in bed, and she wouldn’t respond to anything but the simplest questions.

Then came the ambulance and the emergency hospital. I kept telling and retelling the doctors everything I could about what had been happening. Being a foreigner didn’t help; I felt they weren’t taking me seriously.

She forgot how to speak Romanian and only answered in English. She stared at everything around her with a glazed look in her eyes—like she was seeing right through us. She couldn’t even put on her pants by herself.

I’d been awake for nearly 48 hours. Her sister, Liliana, urged me to go home for a bit, promising she’d stay with her. That was my biggest mistake—because it was the last time I saw her conscious.

Liliana later told me that before transferring her to the Fundeni Clinical Institute, one of the paramedics asked if they were sisters. My girlfriend grinned widely and said, “Yes, we’re sisters.” Moments later, she had what looked like an epileptic seizure and slipped into a deep coma.

I wasn’t there to see it. Just thinking about missing her last moment breaks my heart into pieces I can’t put into words. I should have been there to witness it.

That same night, her heart stopped.

They resuscitated her, but what followed was a month of living in the ICU at Fundeni. I remember almost nothing beyond standing by her bed, talking to her, and listening to the relentless beeping of the machines. It’s all a blur—except for her face. And a bunch of incredibly cruel doctors, refusing any kind of hope.

Then, on 12/23/2024, at 3 a.m., her little heart stopped again. This time, there was no bringing her back. She passed away for good. In truth, she’d likely been brain-dead since the moment they loaded her into that ambulance—right after answering that question about her sister.

That month of praying, consulting countless neurosurgeons, not sleeping or eating, and hoping for a miracle—none of it mattered. She was already gone.

Her name was Maria Cristina Crăciun.

Today is her funeral, which I can’t physically attend. It's taking place in a small community called Rotunda, in Romania. I’m devastated, to say the least.

She was only 33, with her whole life ahead of her. She’ll never have the house we spent so long imagining. She’ll never have a child. She’ll never travel to another new country or try a new food (she was never big on trying new foods anyway).

There’s so much left unsaid between us, and I’d give anything just to talk to her one more time. Honestly, if they’d told me I could give her my heart or brain to keep her alive, I’d have done it in a heartbeat. But it’s meaningless now—only pain remains, for now…

Still, this whole experience has opened my eyes to what love truly is. It carved that feeling into my mind, and I doubt I’ll ever forget. Not only do I know now that what I’ve been longing for my entire life is possible, I also know how it feels. I’ll remember it fondly. And I understand what it takes—and what it gives—to love.

That, at least, is invaluable.

So, I hope that:

\- You’ve also discovered what love is in your relationship.

\- You won’t hold back on saying what matters, because you might not get another chance.

Thank you for reading.

My overall description of Seoul: huge but doesn’t feel like true metropolis. ~85% of the city feels the same, kind of soul less and plastered with gazillion coffee drink chains (mega coffee, subway et al) and cliche like American stuff (burgers etc). Little to no diversity but at the same time no “exotic” feeling. 

Historical sites: of course lots has been shattered by war but I can only comment what I see. The biggest sight ist a palace, which essentially is comparable to a 20-30min walk through park. My first reaction when I was there was “alright and where do we go in?” Just to realize there is no inside. If you are blown away by large historical sites (eg Duomo in Milan, Versailles in Paris, Big Ben in London) there is nothing similar here

Leisure activities: this has annoyed me the most. Yes I went to museums but 90% of other activities were centered around going shopping or to cafes. I explored some amazing street markets but again here I would have thought that there are much more and much larger ones. I found myself way too often in shopping malls that carry exactly the same cookie cutter brands like we have in the west (Ralph Lauren, Lacoste, etc - exactly the same Sortiment and adjusted for FX even the same prices)  

“Vibe”: this is controversial because it’s hard to measure but I found the overall vibe bad. Like some cities have a certain vibe (eg walking by lively pubs in London or inviting looking wine bars in Paris). In all those cities I could just sit for hours and people watch, be inspired bz certain styles etc. - never had that in Seoul. There are large crowds of people everywhere but all just seem to run towards something. It is funny that I now observe this here because that’s how exactly my in-laws behave when I take them to sightseeing in Europe. They constantly rush, are under stress and run around the sights I take them like ticking off a to do list. Same in restaurant, they eat and one second later they jump up and go 😩😂 

A lot of over consumerism / commercial vibe. Big name brands / puffer jackets, always on the phone watching tik tok etc. - rarely did I catch any spontaneous interaction, somebody smiling, a witty comment or whatever. I had zero contact with any other locals whereas in other cities I would constantly meet new people and just strike up conversations at a bar or wherever.

I will come back here of course and hope to catch a different vibe in different seasons, but after 10 days here in winter I just feel immensely drained.",0,1735195915.0,koreatravel,33,0.47,False

Lately, I’ve been reflecting on my past relationships—both friendships and romantic ones. I have never had fleeting connections; they always last long enough for me to learn something real about the other person. I’ve been trying to remember what each of them felt like.

I’ve always viewed my life as a kind of adventure, forging ahead and learning new things on my own terms. That didn’t leave much room to stick with people who saw life differently and didn’t want to walk hand in hand. And yet, I’ve always craved a sense of belonging—a place to call home. Two against the world.

When I look back at the relationship that brought me to Romania, I don’t recall much tender feeling, apart from some wistful nostalgia: we were friends, playing little games, talking about random stuff. I know I pretty much left my whole life behind to come to her, changed my views drastically, adapted to a completely new environment.

But to me, it was still part of my own adventure—just a means to an end. When she broke up with me, I was devastated. Not because I loved her deeply (though she was a dear friend), but because the relationship didn’t end on my terms. By that point, I had already been thinking of leaving. I didn’t believe she could give me what I truly wanted in life.

I came to realize the same dynamic repeated itself in all my relationships. I never truly loved.

Everything really changed this year, though, when I unexpectedly met someone who turned out to be incredibly important. At first, we couldn’t stand each other—she thought I was arrogant and judgmental, and I found her awkward and narrow-minded.

Not exactly a recipe for success, right?

But somehow, over the following two months, we stayed in touch and managed to smooth out our differences. We grew around each other. We talked through everything, discussing what we disliked about each other and how we could fix it. We’re both very set in our ways, but we genuinely tried to see things through each other’s eyes.

We were so different, yet we became closer than anyone—very quickly. We traveled a bit, spent amazing nights just cuddling, woke each other up for morning coffee, took ridiculously long walks, played tennis, watched Comedy Central. More importantly, we took care of each other selflessly, never expecting anything in return.

We were genuinely happy to see each other every time; our smiles couldn’t have been brighter. Suddenly, this country—and the whole world—felt like the best place to be.

And that’s when I finally understood what love is. It’s not a spark, not common interests, definitely not physical appearance (though I never believed it was all about that). It’s the loyalty and willingness to work through differences, keeping the other person’s happiness firmly in mind.

That feeling is so clear to remember.

Fast-forward to the end of November. We’d just returned from Italy—Bologna and Florence. We ate tons of gelato, walked countless steps, and visited ancient buildings. We couldn’t have been happier.

A few days later, she developed a weird rash all over her body. At first, we didn’t think much of it, and neither did the doctors we visited in Bucharest. They said it was a simple allergy and that a few pills should clear it up. Naturally, we relaxed.

But soon, the rash came with excruciating muscle pain, bad enough that she could hardly walk. She started running a fever, developed a sore throat, sweated profusely, and lost her appetite.

We ended up at Victor Babeș Hospital for infectious diseases. After a week there, she was sent home without a diagnosis—just a recommendation to see a rheumatologist. I wanted us to stay, but she was extremely stressed. She’d gained 12 kg in just six days and wanted a couple of days at home first, despite her suffering.

Little did I know that two days later, I’d be living the worst nightmare of my life.

That day, she felt a lot worse. I stayed by her side, bought her pills, checked her temperature, helped her drink water, changed blankets, and talked to her. Around 8 p.m., she said she was very tired and going to sleep.

Over the next few hours, she got up a couple of times to use the toilet, chat with me briefly, kiss me, and tell me she felt awful.

Then the nightmare truly began.

Around 11:30 p.m., I realized something was really wrong. She was cold, her body shook periodically, she thrashed in bed, and she wouldn’t respond to anything but the simplest questions.

Then came the ambulance and the emergency hospital. I kept telling and retelling the doctors everything I could about what had been happening. Being a foreigner didn’t help; I felt they weren’t taking me seriously.

She forgot how to speak Romanian and only answered in English. She stared at everything around her with a glazed look in her eyes—like she was seeing right through us. She couldn’t even put on her pants by herself.

I’d been awake for nearly 48 hours. Her sister, Liliana, urged me to go home for a bit, promising she’d stay with her. That was my biggest mistake—because it was the last time I saw her conscious.

1hmiv90,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/1hmiv90/binary_in_a_fluid_world/,Binary in a Fluid World ,"It all started on a sunny afternoon in Capitol Hill, Seattle, where everyone is supposedly a rainbow-colored, gender-neutral version of themselves. I was sipping my iced coffee, enjoying the rare moment of warmth in this perpetually gray city, when a stranger walked up to me. They—I'm assuming ""they,"" since I could never quite tell with this crowd—looked me up and down with a look that could only be described as judgmental mixed with slight confusion.

“You’re… just a ‘she,’ aren’t you?” they asked, raising an eyebrow.

I paused, trying to understand the question. “Uh… yeah?”

They sighed dramatically. “Wow, you’re like… so *binary*.” 

I blinked. *Binary?* Was that the new insult? I looked at my outfit—jeans and a T-shirt. Nothing particularly revolutionary, but certainly nothing that screamed “this is a conservative fashion statement."" 

“Yeah, I guess I’m just... a *she*,” I replied, shrugging. “It’s not a big deal, right?”

The stranger’s eyes widened. “But you don’t *feel* like you're fluid? Like, don’t you feel, like, multiple things at once? Some days, you’re a she, some days, you’re a they, some days—who knows! You could be a he, a she, a they, a ze, a hir. The possibilities are endless!” They gestured wildly, as if trying to demonstrate a dynamic, multi-gender existence.

I stood there, feeling increasingly uncomfortable, as my iced coffee began to sweat through the paper cup. “Um, I just feel like I’m me? You know… sometimes I’m a ‘she,’ sometimes I’m a person who needs coffee. That’s usually it.”

“Oh, wow,” they said, shaking their head with what I can only describe as solemn pity. “You really should, like, *explore yourself*, you know? There’s so much more to *being* than just existing as a ‘she.’” They gave me a disappointed look before dramatically walking away, leaving me standing there, utterly confused and a little embarrassed.

As I tried to process this interaction, I couldn’t help but wonder: when did the requirement for gender fluidity become a thing? Was I supposed to wake up one morning, feel the winds of the universe, and decide, ""Today, I’m an androgynous space explorer who identifies as both a cat and a toaster""? It was a lot of pressure.

I went home, sat down in front of my mirror, and gave myself a motivational speech: “Okay, self. You’re not *just* a ‘she.’ You can be a *fluid* person too, if you want. You’re a complex, layered human being.” And yet, the only thing I could think of was how much I really liked wearing my old band T-shirt and being, well, me.

The next day, I was at a coffee shop (I swear, I live in coffee shops), when another person, who had more piercings than a jewelry store, approached me with the gravitas of someone about to deliver the secrets of the universe.

“You’re really just… a ‘she,’ huh?” they said, leaning in.

I stared at them. “I mean, yeah, I’m still figuring it out. But mostly, I just like being me. Is that okay?”

The piercing person sighed deeply, like they were hearing the saddest thing imaginable. “You should be more… open. Fluid. Like water, you know?”

I smiled. “So, you’re saying I should just *pour* myself into every situation? Like, literally be a puddle?”

They looked horrified. “No, no! Not like that! It’s about identity. You need to explore more. Don’t you ever just *feel* like being a *they*?”

I blinked. “No, honestly, I mostly just feel like having coffee. Which, by the way, I’m gonna finish. It’s kind of a ‘me’ thing.”

They stared at me for a long moment, clearly processing my resistance to their inclusive agenda. Then, with a dramatic flourish, they muttered something about needing to “check their privilege” before walking off in a huff. 

I stared at my coffee. Maybe I didn’t fit into the gender-fluid mold of Seattle, but one thing was for sure: I was really good at enjoying iced coffee.

I've fallen head over heels for my co-star. It's her first play, but honestly, she steals the show.  I'm so smitten that I've become this weird, lovesick detective, constantly trying to anticipate her needs.  Like, I noticed she never ate the meat sandwiches at the potluck, so I whipped up a batch of potato sandwiches just for her.  Of course, I pretended I'd made them for ""whoever the vegetarian might be,"" but come on, it was totally for her.
And then there was the time she mentioned forgetting her makeup remover. Boom! I ""just happened"" to have a whole pack tucked away in my bag.  Or when she needed speakers?  Mini speaker, right here! It's like I'm some kind of walking, talking emergency kit, fueled by a desperate crush.
The other day, she looked exhausted during the show, and I swear, my heart ached.  So, what did I do?  I made a grand entrance backstage with a steaming cup of coffee, just for her. Okay, fine, I made coffee for the entire cast and crew, but she was the only one I truly cared about.  The way her face lit up and she gave me that kiss on the cheek... worth every penny of that ridiculously overpriced coffee.
Sometimes, our eyes meet across the room, and it's like the world stops spinning.  She pulls my sleeve when she laughs, and we find ourselves sitting next to each other, giggling like idiots.  She even asked me for a mini guitar lesson! And once, just once, she held my hand. It was brief, but electric.
But nothing, absolutely nothing, compares to the hug we shared before our first performance. It was quick, but oh-so-tight, like she was holding on for dear life.  I could feel her eyes closed, her toes barely touching the ground.  It was as if all the emotions she'd been holding back came pouring out in that one embrace.  I swear, I floated for a good five minutes afterward.
Look, I know this all sounds crazy. Maybe I am delusional. But there's this tiny, persistent voice inside me that whispers, ""She's the one.""  And honestly? I really, really hope that voice is right.

1hmil2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hmil2t/im_rlly_confused_and_need_another_perspective/,I’m rlly confused and need another perspective (Hot/Cold),"I had a first date with a girl, and it went really well. She was just starting to recover from being sick but still wanted to meet. After we got coffee, she invited me back to her place. She initiated a lot of contact, touching my hands, hair, we cuddled during a movie, and we kissed a few times. At one point, she mentioned her feet hurt, so I offered a foot massage, which she really enjoyed.

Before I left, she asked me on a second date, offering to cook for me, and seemed super interested. Even sent a follow up text saying she couldn’t wait. But then pulled back and didn’t talk for a couple days, so I gave her space. I noticed she also deleted her Bumble account. However, a couple of days before the second date, she had to cancel because she was feeling sick again. So we agreed to reschedule when she felt better and I gave her more space for like 4 days.

When I reached out with new date plans for Monday, she just replied, “I’d like that :)”. But she hasn’t said if the time I offered works yet and seems kinda short/distant. I can’t tell if she is just not that into texting and prefers to focus on in-person interactions, or if she is just not interested. Idk if I’m just overthinking it or what. Deleting Bumble is the most confusing part (we texted over iMessage)

I come from a family of 9 sisters and brothers (I’m the second youngest). 
I have been a single parent for over 15 years raising 3 boys pretty much on my own. My family very much looked down on the fact that I wasn’t married and dint have a degree. So I went to University and 
studied for 7 year’s and finally graduated with Masters in Music and I work full time. 

I’m been in a blended relationship with my youngest sons father for 7 years and we live separately now  so I still feel like I’m a single parent cause blended relationship cause us to split for a year when we lived together, but now we are back together. However this dint help the opinion of my family.


However I thought this would make my family respect me as as I have a partner and a steady job and accept me and ultimately like me more, however I couldn’t ask my mom to baby sit or meet me for a coffee yet  my sister with all her  partners family support gets my mom baby sitting her child.

They organise family trips to Byron, dinner dates and lunch’s together and never invite me. I’m lucky to see my mom once every 6 months yet we live in the same state and my sister visits from interstate and sees her more frequently. 
I should also mention my family is very wealthy from making money on property and because I woke a 9-5 job and not an entrepreneur, they look down on it.

My only peace comes from playing music (busking) on weekends, it makes me forget about the rejection and try and bring some positivity to myself and community.

I’m trying to be really optimistic and accept that my family don’t like me for whatever reason, however when Christmas comes, I walk into my mothers home and it’s really awkward. And to makes matters worse my partners family I’m not close with. 
So I’m feeling really lonely and down.
My question is how do I leave my best life knowing that my family dosent like me not matter how nice I am to them.
Do I make my friends my family? 
And just accept that this is the way life is?

I’m a 2022 MIT passout and have been working from home in Manipal since then. The thing is, I have zero friends here now, and life’s been feeling kinda meh lately. I used to have such a great time during college, but these days, I just end up spending most of my time at home.

Figured I’d throw this out there—if anyone’s around and wants to hang out, hit me up! A bit about me: I’m 25, male, into music (PCRC is my all-time fave band), love film photography, and I currently work in the film industry.

Would love to chill, grab a coffee, go on a photowalk, or just vibe to some good music. Let me know if you’re down! :)
