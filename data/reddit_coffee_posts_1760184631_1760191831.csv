1o3wi7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1o3wi7j/aitah_new_baby_in_the_family/,Aitah? New baby in the family,"I need some advise. I live with my boyfriends family, and his sister got her first baby about 6 months ago It is the only baby in the family. I do also not have any babies on my side of the family, so i do not have any ”baby crazed” people ok my side.

Since the baby was born, every outing, every cup of coffee, every meeting has been baby themed. We no longer have a conversation with any family member which does not get 360:d in to a conversation about the baby. 

We have been asked to download apps to get updates of pictures of the baby, where you got reminded if you didnt download and connect (cause i guess it was visible who wasnt connected).

We have a family chat which is now used as a daily update of videos and pictures of the baby including also some gross(?) details.

Is this normal? As mentioned, no babies on my side of the family, but i find it strange that there is no single conversation between a group of adults which does not somehow involve the baby.. its as if all other topics vanished or are irrevelant.. 

Should i just disengage? What do you do when you are just not that interested in someones baby that i need daily updates?

1o3whis,https://i.redd.it/ppedj7s2phuf1.jpeg,Grinder doesn’t seem to grind fine enough anymore [Shardor 64mm],"For some sometime the grinder was working pretty good. I was able to set it at the 5ft line you see here and the shots were extracting perfectly (25-30s). 

Now for some reason even if I have it at the lowest setting here the shots brew so fast in less than 15s and there’s not a lot of crema either. 

I’m using fresh medium roast beans that have been no longer than 2 weeks after roast date. 

Is this common or do I need to open the grinder and do something there? Right now I have to pre-infuse the shots for like 20 seconds to get a brew time of around 30s. 

I’d also like to point out that i’m using a single dose 51mm basket that holds 10g of coffee. The bigger one that I have is 14g and that one brews much better but I don’t always want the 14g and I don’t want to just throw away the extra. ",2,1760191513.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

This month’s episode of *Long Island Real Estate with Sal Catalano* breaks down the **September 2025 housing market**, and, no surprise here, **sellers still hold all the control.**

Here’s the quick version:

📍 **Suffolk County:**

* Median Sold Price: **$710,000** (+7.4% YoY)
* Months of Inventory: **3.32** (down 13.5% YoY)
* Sold-to-List Ratio: **107.7%** — that’s nearly **8% over asking!** → Translation: sellers still rule.

📍 **Nassau County:**

* Median Sold Price: **$849,000** (+5% YoY)
* Months of Inventory: **3.0** (down 11.8% YoY)
* Sold-to-List Ratio: **100.6%** → Still strong under $1M, cautious but steady above $1.3M.

💡 **For buyers:**  
This is the time to be fast, strategic, and pre-approved. Waiting won’t help if inventory stays tight.

💡 **For sellers:**  
This is your window. Demand is high, and homes priced correctly are moving fast.

1o3wcvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundTried/comments/1o3wcvn/find_out_if_this_best_coffee_slider_from_anboxit/,Find Out if This Best Coffee Slider from Anboxit Transforms Counters,"The ANBOXIT Wide - Large sliding tray has been a surprising addition to my kitchen, designed to solve specific countertop and appliance accessibility issues. Initially, I wasn’t sure if I really needed something like this, but after regular use, it’s clear this wasn’t just one of those kitchen gadgets that ends up as junk in the back of a cupboard. For a product with thoughtful design and practical features, it has quickly become almost indispensable in my daily routine.

**DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY**  
This tray first caught my eye because of the premium bamboo construction. At 13 by 16 inches, it’s large enough to handle my bulkier appliances, like the air fryer, with room to spare. The bamboo material, consisting of three layered cross-hatched pieces, doesn’t just look elegant—it feels sturdy and up to the task. I’ve put some heavyweights on this tray, such as my water-filled coffee machine, and there’s zero wobble or bending. The tray easily resisted stains from accidental coffee spills too, which was a relief! The rubber wheels at the bottom are a quiet little marvel; they roll so smoothly that even at odd hours, there’s no clattering or screeching. In fact, the ease it brings to moving appliances is probably its biggest advantage.

**FUNCTIONALITY IN ACTION**  
When I started using it, I found myself wondering how I managed without it. Positioned under my upper kitchen cabinets, it’s perfect for sliding out my coffee pot each morning. Thanks to the silent sliding system, no more tugging and dragging that used to scratch up my countertops. It’s incredibly efficient at preventing steam damage to my cabinets, which I failed to realize was an issue until those subtle brown marks started creeping up on the underside of the cabinet. The ANBOXIT tray solved that problem completely within a day of installing it. Want to prepare some pancakes using a mixer? Just whisk it out without lifting a finger—or, well, with minimal effort, at least.

[Check ANBOXIT Wide - Large price on Amazon.](https://gogeary.com/p/b0c9dfws6q/)  

**PLUSES**  
- Elegant and eco-friendly bamboo design fits seamlessly into any kitchen setup.  
- The 3-layer cross-hatching ensures an exceptional sturdiness I genuinely didn’t expect.  
- Very easy to clean and resist stains.  
- Rubber wheels for smooth and silent appliance mobility.  
- Comes with a handle design that allows better grip while pulling the tray.  

**FLAWS**  
- For people with smaller kitchens, the size could be a bit overwhelming—it does require adequate surface area.  
- Rubber wheels, though fantastic overall, may occasionally require cleaning to maintain their glide.  
- At times, heavier items like my instant pot felt slightly sluggish to push at the first attempt.  
- Limited to sliding out; no swiveling or multidirectional motion.  

**PERFORMANCE IN DAILY LIVING**  
This isn’t just about storage; it's about making your life one click smoother. Whether it’s sliding out that massive instant pot for a quick stew or having quick access to my coffee grinder in the morning, the entire operation feels seamless. I’ve even had my partner comment on how much easier meal prep has become, as the “appliance shuffle” takes just a matter of seconds now. The star performance, though, has to be its ability to tackle multiple types of appliances: it's not a one-trick pony. I've rotated different machines to test this, from bulky air fryers to standard toasters, and it accommodates them with ease.

**OTHER OPTIONS**  
At first, I considered other products in the market, like the rolling mats and basic plastic trays. But let’s be real, those have nowhere near the durability or aesthetic appeal of bamboo. Some competitors didn’t even have a handle design, making them a nightmare to slide. Others struggled with heavier machines—unlike this product, which glides naturally without demanding Herculean strength. While ceramic or metallic options are on the market, they felt irrelevant for the warmth of a kitchen setting, and metal particularly seemed prone to rusting. This product, in comparison, offers both practicality and style.

**COST-EFFECTIVENESS**  
Given its robust construction and design, the value shines. Many appliance trays out there either lack durability or don’t roll as smoothly, meaning you’re stuck replacing them in a short span. This tray proves itself worth every penny because of its longevity and the time you save not wrestling with appliances anymore. The eco-friendly bamboo means it’s not just contributing to your home’s organization but also aligning with sustainable living values.

It became a routine for the both of us. Until.. hindi nya ako kinausap for 2 days. I chatted him after 2 days kasi if he wants to end, I want it na galing sakanya, ayokong iaassume ko lang. Sabi nya he chose to keep quite kasi he was horny and ayaw nya ibuhos sakin yun, since for him wala pa kami sa ganong level that time. After that, balik kami sa routine ng updates and calls. He also considered himself as my ""boyfriend"" and he calls me ""girlfriend"" everytime. I'm currently graduating and yes nalate ako for my age. 

He also sends me money, pang coffee, pang extra allowance, pang cravings and nung birthday ko, nagpadala sya ng cake and 10k to celebrate my birthday. Since we dont celebrate it as a fam, he said I should go shopping or go out with my friends. 

Ang sched nya is 3pm to 3am, he's working sa US based company, tech support something ata role nya. Yung byahe nya 1 and 30 mins since he's driving. Off nya ng Saturday, pagkauwi nya ng 6am ng Sat, mostly nagigising sya ng 6pm to 7pm, tatawag sya saglit. Tapos maglilinis ng apartment and pupunta sa mom nya. Then tatawag sya around 2am to check on me.

We broke up a year ago, but she was always an emotional rollercoaster. One of the reasons we ended things was because she would literally give me gifts, thoughtful stuff, things that showed care, and just a few hours later say, “Don’t you think we should break up?” I was completely confused. I never knew if she loved me, if I did something wrong, or if it was all just manipulation. Getting something nice and then being rejected right after messes with your head.

I used to beg her to go out, to see me. She’d always cancel last minute or act like she didn’t really want to be there. When I finally ended it, she said I was the one who used her. A few days later, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Something didn’t feel right. So I downloaded a dating app, and there she was. Her profile was already there, which made me think she’d been using it even before our breakup. When I confronted her, she said she was looking for her friend’s ex.

After a year with no contact, she came back, same strange behavior all over again. She’d ask me for random favors, like bringing her coffee at work. And if I said no, she’d reply, “That’s fine, my friend will bring it.” It made me feel completely replaceable, like nothing I did ever mattered. Every favor just pulled me back in, made me more confused. I kept asking myself if it was love or just another game she was playing. She’d ask for sweets, toys, little gifts, and then, out of nowhere, she said she wanted to have kids.

She came over one night while I was drunk, almost something happened, and two days later she told me, “I can’t force you to have kids, but I could poke a hole in the condom.” I didn’t even know how to react. I just froze. I didn’t know if I should laugh, cry, or just disappear.

She’d make plans with me and cancel minutes before. On the same day she said she was going out drinking with another guy, she sent me a picture of herself at home. She’d tell me, “We don’t work,” and then the next day say, “It’s now or never. If we don’t get back together, someone might ask me out this week.”

I was completely lost, not knowing what was real, what was manipulation, or if any of it would ever stop.

If anyone’s ever gone through something like this, I’d really like to hear from you. Being alone, with your head full of mixed feelings and doubts, it’s really hard to know where to go or what to do.

TL;DR: She manipulated me for over a year with gifts, mixed signals, random favors, and almost tricked me into having kids. I’m completely lost and confused. Am I overreacting for cutting her off completely?",2,1760190834.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

“The Invisible Hand and the Visible Finger: A Love Letter to Sri Lankan Capitalism”

Ah, capitalism in Sri Lanka — that glorious system where the invisible hand of the market isn’t so much invisible as it is busy picking your pocket while patting you on the back for being “resilient.” We are told this is the best of all possible systems, and perhaps it is — if you’re the one sitting at the top floor of a glass building in Colombo 07 sipping imported coffee while telling your underpaid staff to “embrace company values.”

The Holy Trinity of Corporate Values

Every Sri Lankan company has its sacred trinity: Integrity, Innovation, and Teamwork.

Of course, Integrity means “don’t steal from the company — that’s management’s job.”
Innovation means “find cheaper ways to get the same work done with fewer people.”
And Teamwork? That means you and your colleagues suffer together in silence while the boss presents your project as his “visionary leadership” during the board meeting.

Each Monday begins with a motivational quote on the company WhatsApp group — usually sent by the HR manager at 6:45 AM, before she herself starts crying in the bathroom stall. “Together, we can achieve greatness,” it reads. Nobody replies because they’re too busy figuring out how to survive on a salary that disappears by the 10th of the month, after paying rent, fuel, and the small privilege of existing.

The Great Sri Lankan Dream

Once upon a time, Sri Lankan capitalism promised a middle-class paradise: a house, a car, and maybe a kid who goes to an international school where English is taught with an accent that sounds like an identity crisis. Now, the dream has evolved — survival is the dream.

People no longer talk about “career growth.” They talk about “escaping.” The new corporate value system is:

Vision: To migrate.

Mission: To save in dollars.

Core Values: Pretend you’re happy on LinkedIn.


Corporate Culture: The Cult of the Meeting

Ah, meetings — the ritual sacrifice of productivity. Every day, Sri Lankan office workers gather in fluorescent-lit rooms to “discuss key deliverables” that will never be delivered. Managers speak in fluent jargon: “We need to synergize our core competencies to align with stakeholder expectations.” Which translates roughly to: “I have no idea what’s going on, but I need to sound important.”

PowerPoint slides are the holy scripture. The number of slides is directly proportional to how little anyone actually understands the project.

The CEO as a Lifestyle Guru

Our corporate leaders aren’t just CEOs anymore — they’re gurus. They post selfies on LinkedIn with captions like:

> “Leadership isn’t about being in charge. It’s about taking selfies while pretending to empower others.”



They talk about “mindfulness” and “work-life balance” while making sure you answer emails at 10 PM. They attend leadership seminars at five-star hotels where they meditate on how to outsource your job.

The Myth of Meritocracy

The Sri Lankan private sector loves to say, “We reward talent and hard work.” Of course, talent means “knowing the right uncle,” and hard work means “doing your boss’s job for him.” Promotions are based on the ancient law of Nepotism and Networking — the two pillars holding up the corporate temple.

If you question it, you’ll be told, “This is how things are done here,” which is the local translation of “shut up and suffer.”

CSR: Corporate Sin Redemption

Corporate Social Responsibility is where companies try to buy forgiveness for their sins. After exploiting employees and overcharging customers, they plant five trees and post it on Facebook. “We at XYZ Holdings believe in giving back to the community,” says the caption — right under a photo of the CEO holding a shovel for exactly 45 seconds.

Meanwhile, the workers who actually dug the holes aren’t in the photo — but they did receive a free branded cap, so all is well.

The New Religion

Capitalism in Sri Lanka is not an economy anymore; it’s a religion. The gods are Profit and Prestige, and the high priests wear suits imported from Singapore. The masses bow before the altar of “brand loyalty,” worshipping the logos that colonize every aspect of daily life.

We no longer ask, “What is good?”
We ask, “What is profitable?”
And in this faith, suffering is not a problem — it’s a KPI.

Conclusion: The Last Power Cut

So here we are — a nation that once dreamed of self-sufficiency now powered by imported slogans and secondhand capitalism. When the lights go out (again), we’ll sit in the dark, illuminated only by the soft glow of our smartphones, scrolling through motivational posts by our CEOs about “embracing challenges.”

And as the generator hums in the manager’s office, we’ll whisper our new national prayer:

> “Dear capitalism, give us this day our daily inflation, and forgive us our poverty, as we forgive those who profit against us.”

I recently got a De’Longhi Rivelia and I’m a bit confused by all the drink options. There’s espresso, lungo, coffee, long, americano, and iced espresso etc.

They all look pretty similar to me,  just different names and cup sizes. Can someone explain in simple terms what the actual differences are between these coffee recipes? Which ones use more water, milk, or strength settings?

Trying to figure out what’s best for a normal everyday coffee as well as making my own coffee recipes 

Thanks!

So I work with an older lady who is probably around my mom’s age. This woman, started off really quirky and odd but I didn’t think of her as rude or anything; I thought she was a good person/nice. However, I think I might’ve misjudged… or am I crazy? I’m sorry, I’m seeking validation here. Especially because I’ve started feeling harassed. Getting into it…

This woman has caused multiple inappropriate or made it a hostile workplace incidents and I’m going to list them not in order because I am doing my best, seeing as I left my work today in tears. I ended up working from another building about a street or so over. I am probably going to work there for another week at that location. So there is that.

Where we work it’s loud, we work in a front desk role and hundreds of people come in and out and it gets loud. The previous people in my position didn’t seem to have any issues with it, but this woman does. She will yell at people and tell them to shut up or for more context; a supervisor over a team was talking to a few members, while she was on the phone, they were a little loud and instead of just asking them to be quiet she screamed at them, saying “SHUT THE F—- UP.” While she was on the phone with another supervisor. 

Another time, an employee came up and tried to make a joke with her. “You ain’t never drink all your coffee.” Or something along those lines is what he said and she snapped saying, “that is none of your business” and she just got a real sour look on her face. That guy told her to leave him alone because he doesn’t want to deal with her anymore. 

Another guy we work with she was really rude to. She also had an inappropriate relationship with him. He had also helped her move, twice, and the second time he asked her to sign a contract and pay him for him helping her. She told me, “If you’re expecting payment then he shouldn’t expect anything from me if you know what I mean.” This guy walks by and says goodbye to me, and he wouldn’t speak to her for a while. He eventually does start to speak to her, but she’s rude and nasty at first and says back-handed comments when he’s leaving like, “I don’t care about him.” And again, makes a sour face.

She says that a lot, “I don’t care” which I’m thinking is an implication that she actually does care and is just bitter? 

Another time I threw away my chipotle and I was so confused but it was my money?? She tried to lecture me like she was my mom. She told me, “don’t get so much food”  In turn I said, “but it’s chipotle and they give you a lot of food and I don’t like leftovers reheated twice” And she proceeded to tell me, “well don’t get chipotle then.” Like what even, who are you? Who do you think you are? Then I told her, “well it’s my money… so.” And which she had another smart-back handed comment to say in return. It’s like she always has to be right.

For example, she said I sent her a SNL skit. I have never seen an episode of SNL or any skits of it until she showed me one of this woman acting really weird on stage. We had went back and forth. She kept telling me, “No you sent it.” And I kept telling her that I did not send her a link to the video because I had absolutely no idea what the hell she was talking about. I was so confused. I let her have the last word because it wasn’t worth it at the time but like I had pulled up all my messages with her (I had maybe 3-5 in total including the ones I had sent and received from her). I had the receipts but like allowed her to be right because it shut her up.

She had also got mad because my supervisor would communicate with me and not her, and that never made sense to me; he is my supervisor and not hers? She always got really bitter when he would walk by. She would make that sour face again. I had later found out he wanted as little communication with her as possible because she would flip the lid. Before I had started there, she would be doing my job that I have now. One of the supervisors over the teams gave her a stack of paperwork and allegedly she yelled at him and refused to do it. 

Which I wholeheartedly agree that that is most likely accurate because she does refuse to do her job. I have listened to her, she complains about being asked to be pulled to do a job that is a requirement. She says things when we get emails about it just out loud, thinking to herself, “I’m not doing that.” Etc. then it’s funny because we sit up just twiddling our thumbs and playing on our phones and talking and she complains about not having enough work. However, I have went and sought out more work for me to do. She is pissed because she’s not getting more work. Which confuses me, because she complains about doing her job but also complains about not getting enough? Then she makes bitter sounding comments like, “That’s fine they can pay me to sit up here and do nothing.” Like what, you should never aspire to be like that.

By the way, talking with this woman — I feel like I know her whole life story after a few months. Her mother is a narcissist and she’s had to deal with it. That’s all I’m going to divulge for her private life.

She has also jokingly tried to do a high kick in someone’s face, and almost kicked them. In the middle of an office. Like what??? Who does that? 

One of the supervisors of the team, I work with closely because it’s part of my role. He came up and asked for help with his computer, and which I was able to help. He made a comment and said he’s going to come to me for all his computer questions, cool that’s fine. She did not like him saying that, she got offended and said, “well you can ask me too” then he said, “Yeah but you work under another supervisor and we work under so and so.” And she said “well we all should work together there shouldn’t be a divide like that” like she just got so mad and passionate about it. He had just ended up walking away and now this supervisor is scared to ask me stuff in front of her because of how she acts. He has said “I would ask you more but then she has to always say something.”

I have had conversations with team members and she has to interject herself into them and ask about things she overhears. I’ve had people I talk to downright ignore her. These people used to also come up and talk to the old front desk employees but when she started she made people feel uncomfortable. For example, she’s talked about her not having a gag reflex to other employees (I have literally overheard this, she was talking to a guy we work with). Then she also told someone, “I wonder what makes these guys dicks hard.” I heard that through the grapevine but I wholeheartedly agree she said that as well because she’s just that inappropriate. She demeans all the males we work with, and she’ll look at them and make comments to me (I am an engaged woman set to be married in December). She’ll ask me if I think someone is attractive and it was making me really uncomfortable. I don’t look at my coworkers like that. I am there to work. I have only ever commented that someone had pretty eyes. It just feels very demeaning the way she looks at the male employees we work with. It also feels like she doesn’t respect my relationship at all with my fiancée when she says things like that to me. 

One of the team supervisors came up all heated because of something and I can’t remember what he said. He wasn’t rude just sounded very distressed in my opinion. But she had yelled at him to take his shit elsewhere as he walked away. 

She also had this bad behavior of telling me what she’s doing to be petty or be a vindictive person. She said that she was still getting emails from her old department and she’s saving them all up so she can send them to them at the end of the year. What sane person does that? Just keep asking for them to remove you until they’re tired of you.

She had also told me she used to work at a front desk in her last department at one point and she noticed how many times this one person got up and used the bathroom and made a comment about it. Like who do you think you are? That girl could’ve had a medical condition, could’ve been medication, you don’t know but it’s none of your business. 

She was then talked to about her behavior a little bit. She calmed down with the screaming and cussing. (She had since said the thing to a coworker about having a gag reflex, and also continues to talk to me and point out guys and asks if I think they’re attractive. — sorry just putting them in, not in any particular order.) 

However she will still say, “If someone has a problem with something you say that’s their problem.” I absolutely hate this phrase and have never heard it before I met this woman but she says it a lot. This phrase sounds like someone who does not want to hold themselves ever accountable for things they say or do. Like sometimes people say the wrong things, or what you say affects people and that’s not always their problem because we are human and prone to human error. Your actions and words do affect people and if there is a problem with something you said or did you should be held accountable. Or am I wrong?

She has a strong disdain for the phrase, “It is what it is.” She says she thinks it’s a toxic phrase because you could change whatever it is. However I don’t feel like that is entirely true, sometimes things are entirely out of your control. 

More recently she has basically been following me around. She is not above me by any means. I do not report to her. On Monday she stood over my computer saw something and sent an email to literally everyone about it. (It wasn’t anything inappropriate but it wasn’t her business.) She was so mad and kept calling me out in phone calls in front of me. On this same day, I had gotten up and said, “I’m gonna go wash my hands before I eat.” Went and washed my hands, well in the bathroom I ran into another supervisor over the team she had come out of the stall. This supervisor was out half of last week. So I was filling her in because I had done my best and helped out with her paperwork. I was gone a while. But we were talking about work and everything. When I walked out of the bathroom, this woman up front I work with had come to find me. She made the excuse, “Oh, I just wanted to check on you make sure you’re okay.” Like umm. Me and the supervisor just looked at each other. I felt extremely uncomfortable, but let it pass. The same supervisor had left, saying she was going to go make her donuts. (This means she’s going to go out and make her rounds and check on her team). The front desk woman said, “She needs to stop saying that, that’s probably derogatory.” Like what? I told her I don’t think it was but she always has to be right. 

The following day on Tuesday, things went normal but I had started to get quiet. Late on Tuesday I was sent an HR meeting request because of what this woman had saw on my computer. I was going to meet with them on Wednesday. So I decided y’know I’m going to ice this woman out because I am just done. I say good morning on Wednesday, start doing my work, then she starts trying to talk to me. I tell her I’m going to focus on my work. So I start doing that. I had let my direct supervisor know I’m going to be gone for a meeting at 8:30 at another building and I talk to the manager of the building as well. I told him I feel like she’s attacking me now and I need to defend myself. So I go over to the meeting, I decide that I want to file a formal HR complaint. They send me what I need and I thank them and go about my day. I go back to work at my normal location. I end up having a meeting with the manager of the building. I was gone for a while. We got off topic, the supervisor who I talked to in the bathroom came in to talk for a minute, she was going to corroborate my story and make a statement as well. Everything was good. This front desk woman calls looking for me. I was in a meeting with the manager of the building. The only people who need to know where I’m at, what I’m doing is my direct supervisor and the manager. I don’t know why she called looking for me. I started feeling like she’s stalking me. Harassing me. Like this was a hostile work environment. So I go about my day after that. I end up getting all my tasks done and towards the end of the day, I start talking to my old supervisors wife — she works in the building. (My supervisor had gotten transferred.) this woman told me the story of this front desk woman on why she barely comes up to talk; because she makes her feel uncomfortable. Front desk woman told ex supervisors wife, that she wants to know what makes these guys dicks hard. Like what the absolute hell. So I go into it, I guess she can tell I’m stressed. We sit in the conference room for a moment. Until 2pm hits. The front desk woman comes looking for me again, to say bye. Like what. If I am not up there, you do not need to come find me. I am not a person you need to keep tabs on. I want to say these things but I am scared of her because she is unhinged and she screams and yells and gets a bad attitude. I have anxiety and I don’t want to deal with her. 

The following day, I go in and I barely talk to her. I say good morning and I say hello to everyone else and talk to other people. I get up and come and go as I please. Not saying a single word. She keeps asking me if I’m okay, trying to make small talk. 

Now I see her “friendliness” as a façade. Her inside is truly ugly. So I don’t want to talk to her. So I don’t talk. At the end of the day, I tell her to have a good day and go home. 

On Friday, this was just the tip of the iceberg. I was in a meeting with some of the employees and the managers — I was taking notes. I got a call from HR, when I get out of the meeting, I go back to my desk and plan to call HR back. This front desk woman yelled, partially because it was loud, “Were you in a meeting?” She said it 3 x, both times I tried to ignore her. I ended up just saying, “Yeah” or nodding my head — I don’t know it was a blur. I go outside, call HR back and find a private office to do this call. I find out that some things can’t be tried again because of double jeopardy. That makes sense. That’s fine. However, they also told me that her following me to the bathroom, etc. might just be thrown out if there was an investigation. She could just say she was there because it was a free country and she was walking by there. I was like but I have witnesses. She had stopped and talked to us, said she was looking for me? She had called the superintendent looking for me? I was just so confused. I broke down in tears and said I still would want to continue the investigation. I left the HR call with that. Left the room to get my ducks in a row, was going to ask my ex-supervisor’s wife if she would corroborate my story before I move forward with the complaint. I just felt alone, overwhelmed and like people keep saying they’re on my side they have my back but no one can protect me from this woman it feels like. So I just went into tears. Front desk lady’s direct supervisor saw me and said let’s talk to the manager and I got the approval to go home except I don’t want to go home because of that woman. I was told to go to HR, so I left and went to HR. I talked to them in person so now I’m working there for the next week temporarily. Before you all say, why isn’t this woman fired? Because we have a union and the union protects her.

What is the best course of action to work with someone like this? Am I crazy?

We’ve been together since college. We love each other and always thought that would get us through everything. But that mindset has only made her lazier year after year. 

Just before we got married, I discovered she had been hiding credit card debt from me. Around that time her grandmother passed and her inheritance covered the debt, but left her absolutely broke. That should have been my first red flag. After getting married, I noticed Amazon packages at the door every day when I came home from work. It’s always random garbage that she saw advertised on Instagram. I work 40+ hours a week, while my wife has a part-time cashier job that gives her maybe two shifts a week. And every week she asks me for money. I’ve come to the unfortunate realization she is terrible with money and just doesn’t think about it. She goes shopping and buys 3 loose cans of coke for $3 dollars each, instead of buying a case for $7. She’ll go to get eggs and come back with bags of random garbage, to “decorate the apartment” but it’s all tacky plastic from the dollar store. She thinks it’s ok, because even though there’s a lot of stuff, they were only $1 each. She sees the tag prices, but never does that math that will give her the total amount she spent. She keeps asking to order fast food and complains that she doesn’t like the food we have in the house.

A few months back we both lost our jobs and I had to dig into my savings, just to get us by. Nearly $20,000 gone in a couple months. I had saved that money for over 10 years, by skimping and scraping and purposely staying in, when my friends were having fun together. I never had a lot of money, but have always had a good work ethic. For years I had been telling her we have to save as much as possible and she never understood why, until we were jobless and facing possible homelessness. Luckily I was able to find work that pays enough to recover some of the damage. She recently got another cashier job, with two shifts a week. But then signed up for an elective surgery, which took her out of commission for nearly 2 months. Which meant she couldn’t work during that time. 

Then yesterday I came home and saw a brand new shiny credit card on the coffee table. When I asked her about it, she said the company just sent it to her randomly. Then I found out she already used it that day, when she hasn’t paid off her other credit card from the past month. If she paid them off on time, I would have no issue. But she is constantly spending, to the point she can’t afford things like her medication, so I have to pay even more. I asked her why she would start using a new credit card, if her other one isn’t paid off. Her response was “I just didn’t think about it.” That is her response to everything that makes our life together more difficult.
I’m honestly at a point of giving up. I never wanted money to overshadow our love, but it’s hard to love someone who doesn’t listen and constantly puts us in financial risk. 

How do I get through to her? I don’t think I can stay if she keeps this up. ",4,1760190527.0,Marriage,8,0.83,False

1o3w2gn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1o3w2gn/should_you_buy_the_aqua_crest_inline_water_filter/,Should You Buy the AQUA CREST Inline Water Filter Review for 5-Year Use?,"The AQUA CREST AQF-INL Inline Water Filter reshaped my perspective on water filtration systems after using it for a few months with my refrigerator. I wasn’t just hoping for better-tasting water—I outright needed it. With frequent complaints from family members about the surprising chlorine taste in our fridge's water and ice, I knew that a solution was overdue. The seemingly endless praise I read about this product’s efficiency was a driving force behind my decision to give it a spin.

**Compact Design That Fits Just About Anywhere**

The first thing that struck me was its modest design. At 3.38"" x 10.78"", it doesn’t require much space behind your fridge or wherever you decide to install it. This product came with both 1/4” compression fittings and push-to-connect options, making installation ridiculously simple. I even managed to set it up by myself—no tools necessary and no frantic SOS calls to my handy neighbor. A quick push of the tubing into its designated spot, a firm tug to check it’s secure, and voilà—the filter was up and running. Admittedly, I spent a few extra minutes triple-checking connections the first time since I was terrified of water spraying everywhere.

Check [AQUA CREST AQF-INL Inline Water Filter] price on Amazon.

**Effective Filtration That You Can Taste**

If there's anything that the AQUA CREST Inline Water Filter excels at, it’s delivering crisp, clean-tasting water by reducing chlorine and odor. After letting it run through a few gallons to prime, the difference in water quality was immediately noticeable. Even my kids, who aren’t exactly aficionados of tasty water, noticed that their ice no longer gave off that faint 'swimming pool' aroma. While I can't scientifically vouch for its carbon-block filtering power against contaminants like PFAS or PFOA, I can firmly attest to its impact on taste and smell.

**Merits**

- The 5-year or 5,000-gallon service life is fantastic. I didn’t expect this level of longevity at such a reasonable cost!
- BPA-free and lead-free materials provide peace of mind regarding health and safety.
- Versatility is a winning point here. This filter works seamlessly with refrigerators, RVs, coffee makers, and even RO systems.  
- Zero reduction in water pressure despite being connected to my fridge—this wasn’t always the case with previous products I tried.  

**Hiccups You Might Find**

While overall satisfied, it’s fair to admit no product is perfect:

- There’s no reduction in Total Dissolved Solids (TDS). If you’re someone obsessed with this metric in water, you’d need additional filtration.
- Installing required precise measurement of tubing insertion depth (about 20mm). Slight missteps can lead to leakage, as I impatiently learned!
- Its effectiveness at removing contaminants like PFAS isn’t verifiable by the average consumer; this requires blind trust in its certifications.

**Competing Products**

It’s no secret that inline water filters have strong competition. A notable example would be the GE GXRTDR or Samsung’s external filters. Compared to these, the AQUA CREST device triumphs easily in terms of lifespan, being capable of lasting five years where others max out around six months. However, competitors sometimes offer integrated meters or reminders, something the AQUA CREST lacks entirely. While brands like GE provide slightly better build quality for heavy-duty pipelines, they feel less approachable for DIY installation.

**Money’s Worth**

Even though you can’t put an exact dollar value on 5 years of cleaner water, the price-to-durability ratio here absolutely shines. Splurge once, and you won’t have to think about replacements until you’ve forgotten this thing even existed. However, knowing prices can fluctuate, I’d recommend keeping tabs on discounts frequently to snag a deal.

Also this included a Bolivia 62% pack! That keeps humidity in check. These are dense tough buds! They are also unbelievably sticky this bud likes to hang out at the top of the grinder because it is that sticky my fingers practically turned green. So you gotta take the grinder apart and carefully get what is on top out without making a mess. 
Ok taste is also very dynamic with lots of notes of flavor some have compared this with coffee if you are using that comparison don’t think average cup of joe this is more like an earthy coffee like the expensive kinds that taste earthy and unique this smoke is not harsh but there is a bite to it the effects creep up and are deeply relaxing this entire strain experience has a jungley feel to it it’s a solid unique flavor the effects are pronounced and relaxing this strain is a great deal at $79 an oz and another great one to keep in daily rotation!

6 months into the relationship and the happiest 6 months of my life. He started a new job 4 weeks ago and moved back home, which I know he has been struggling with. He mentioned feeling a little overwhelmed with everything last Saturday (week ago today) and I reassured him, let him know I could give him as much space as he needed or could hold his hand through this, whatever to help him.

He said that wasn’t necessary yet but thanks for the support. We continued on, his texts were a bit off, could tell he was struggling so I gave him space, checked up on him.

We were supposed to go to his friends engagement party last night, we had picked clothes out shopping on Thursday night, he kissed me, thanked me for being there for him and went home. He texted I love you before going to bed and I felt a sense of hope that all would be okay, bare in mind we were to have a chat on Saturday for time between us to have an honest chat about our relationship.

He texts me yesterday morning telling me what shirt he is wearing so we don’t wear the same thing, I tell him what train i’m getting so we can travel in together to the party. He asks if we can get a coffee for some quiet time before we go - i assumed this was so he could decompress after work. 

Get to the coffee shop, and he comes in and breaks up with me. Tells me he needs no contact for a while, and maybe we could be back together after a while.

I feel, betrayed, abandoned, embarrassed that I had bared my soul like that and he broke up with me in a busy coffee shop where I couldn’t even maintain my dignity + travel back home after getting fully ready for the party. 

His reasoning was that he had felt distance between us for the past 2 weeks … which he never mentioned to me, he had told me that it was work relating. 

anyways, feeling broken - we have plans for my birthday next week which now embarrassingly I have to cancel. we had concerts and a cabin in December ( which we booked three weeks ago) booked, all of which he has the money for.

 i thought he was the one, still do, and i am at a loss at what to do from here - im already knackered at the thought of doing this without him.

I’m not trying to sound judgmental, I’m just genuinely curious about the mindset behind it. What do you get out of sharing those daily moments? ",1,1760189904.0,NoStupidQuestions,7,0.67,False

I’m about to show you how I turned everyday Amazon product reviews filmed in my living room into over €12,000 in passive commissions — without ads, a fancy camera, or a massive audience.

My first month’s payout? €7.  
Now, videos I filmed months ago are still making me money while I’m cooking dinner or chasing my kids around the house.



# The Strategy That Actually Works

Forget all the “you need a big following” nonsense.  
Here’s the truth: Amazon doesn’t care how many followers you have — it cares if your videos help customers decide what to buy.

I started reviewing the stuff I already owned: my coffee machine, my tripod, my kid’s toys.  
Each video is 45–60 seconds max. Clear, honest, useful.

Now, those videos appear right on the product listings — where thousands of shoppers are already ready to buy. That’s how you make commissions while you sleep.



# My Upload System

* 1–2 videos per day. Consistency beats aesthetics.
* All EU storefronts. Spain, France, Germany, Italy, UK — same videos, five times the reach.
* Pick high-traffic products. Not random items — things people are already searching for.

The more videos you upload, the more Amazon starts pushing them into carousels. Suddenly you’re getting paid for sales in five countries — without leaving your house.



# The Numbers So Far

2025 earnings: **€12,000+** (and climbing)  
Average daily commissions: **€30–€70**  
Videos live across **5 marketplaces**  
Paid ads: **€0**  
Tools used: ChatGPT + Canva + Coffee



# The Guide That Breaks It All Down

I wasted 2 months trying to figure this out - you don't have to. 

I’ve put everything into one step-by-step guide — how to get approved, what videos to film, how to upload to all EU storefronts, and how to land free products and brand deals once your videos start taking off.

It’s not theory. It’s my exact process — the one that’s currently paying my bills.



# The Reality Check

This isn’t an overnight thing.  
The first few weeks felt like I was filming for no one.  
Now, months later, I'm earning someone's 9-5 paycheck passively (up to 2k/month).

If you want quick dopamine hits, scroll TikTok.  
If you want passive income that stacks, start uploading.



# The Invitation

I’m not gatekeeping. If I can figure this out between school runs and editing videos on my phone, you absolutely can too.

The sooner you start, the better — Amazon’s rolling this program out across Europe fast, and those early videos are the ones that keep paying long-term.

Need more proof? I've been documenting my journey for the past year:

1o3vuck,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1o3vuck/aio_found_a_shirt_that_doesnt_belong_to_us/,AIO Found a shirt that doesn't belong to us.,"Ok for context.  My wife and I have been living together for 7 years and married for 3 years. 
She is super shy anti even friends so im 100% sure she will never cheat on me.  She also doesn't have a car and can't drive. 
I am a hard working out of the house most of the day antisocial husband.  My job is labor intensive so I go trough clothes at a crazy pace. So I always buy the cheapest.  


Yesterday I was cold when I woke up early for work and grabbed a shirt from the hallway. ( clean clothes i forgot to put away)
I sat down with my coffee and started to notice hey this plain grey t shirt that looks like all my other cheap grey shirts is really really soft. 
Curious if checked the tag a brand i have never heard of. Not the shirts I buy for myself. This is an expensive brand I buy the cheapest I can find. 
Its the same size we both wear so I asked my wife if it was hers. She said no im the only one with grey t shirts. 
Its definitely not mine. Where did it come from why was it in the recently washed?

Im about to start accusing my wife of cheating i just need to know if im over reacting?

EDIT!

Well this was solved.  By my wife. 
Combination of my poor memory of something that happened 2 years ago and being overworked and stressed. 

2 years ago I ripped my shirt at work. I didn't have a spare and went to a high end clothing place i was working near and was forced to buy a 60 dollar shirt or be removed from work.  
This fancy shirt I threw in my car as a backup its been there this whole time.  Recently I cleaned out my car lots of clothes, jackets and work stuff went into the washer.  


Wife reminded me of this incident.  I knew I was overreacting. ",1,1760189807.0,AmIOverreacting,18,0.67,False

I’ve been a police officer for ten years. A few weeks ago, I found my niece’s face on a missing poster. The date on it was the day I found it.


I started my shift just like any other, with a cup of coffee.
Ten years on the job, caffeine’s basically part of the uniform.

Get to work.
Throw on my uniform.
Grab the keys to my sector car.
Get the coffee flowing through my veins as fast as possible.

My routine rarely strays. I stop at the same coffee shop five minutes from the precinct. They know my name. They know my order. I could walk in half asleep and still leave with exactly what I need.

While I waited at the counter, my eyes drifted over to the cork board near the door. The one layered with half torn flyers and yellowed business cards.

Landscapers looking for work.
A babysitter trying to pick up extra hours.
A dog walker for people too lazy or too busy to do it themselves.

Just as my name was called, something new caught my eye.

A missing poster.

I don’t remember ever seeing one there before. Maybe I never paid attention.

I grabbed my coffee and stepped toward the board. I took a closer look, tugging the paper free from the thumbtack.

The photo stopped me cold.

It wasn’t a blurry security image or a kid who looked kind of familiar.

It was my niece.

Her school photo.

The same one my sister keeps on the fridge. The same one I carry in my wallet.

Above the picture, bold black letters.

MISSING
Last seen:

The date written there was the same day I was standing in that coffee shop, holding it.



I didn’t have time to be confused.
My hands were already patting my pockets, searching for my phone.
When I realized it was still in the car, I ran, shoulder checking the door on my way out, nearly spilling someone’s latte as I pushed past.

No missed calls. No voicemails. No texts.
I hit my sister’s number.

No answer.
Tried again.
Nothing.

I kept calling the whole drive over. Each ring felt longer than the last.

I pulled up hard in front of her house, tires scraping against the curb.
My niece’s scooter was still on the porch from the night before, lying on its side.

I rang the bell, then knocked, then called her name.

The door flew open.
My sister stood there, hair wet, bathrobe disheveled, eyes wide like she’d just run from the shower.

For a second she just stared at me, confused, trying to place why I was there.
Then she saw the crumpled flyer in my hand.

The color drained from her face.

“What happened?” she whispered.



I stepped inside. She knew something was wrong before I said a word.

I held out the paper. “Look at this.”

Her eyes went wide. For a second she didn’t breathe.
“What the hell is this? She’s fine, she’s at school!”

“Are you sure?”

“Yes. I saw her get on the bus just like every morning.”

“Call the school,” I said. “Now.”

“You’re scaring me. Why wouldn’t she be there?”

“Just call.”

She grabbed her phone with shaking hands. I turned away, trying to keep my head clear.
I needed to radio this in, tell a supervisor, something.

There was no chance in hell I could finish my shift without knowing she was safe.

I walked into the kitchen, trying to gather my thoughts.
Mind racing.

The fridge caught my eye.
The picture, her school photo, the one that I had grown accustomed to seeing, was gone.

I went back to the living room. My sister was standing still, phone slipping from her hand.
It hit the floor and bounced once against her bare foot.

Tears filled her eyes.
“She never made it,” she whispered.



I called my supervisor and explained the situation.
Told him we had a missing juvenile.
Told him about the missing poster I found.

He assured me that all hands would be on deck and told me to wait there so my sister and I could give statements when the other officers and detectives arrived.

Even though my sister was distraught, we still needed answers.
I asked her about the missing photo from the fridge.

She looked confused.
“I never took that photo down. Why would I?”

The pit that had already settled in my stomach felt like it was spreading through the rest of my body.

I told my sister not to move and stood up slowly.
I took the gun from my holster and began to clear the house.

Something hung over the place.
I can’t put words to it, but it didn’t feel right.

The last room left to check was my niece’s.
I opened the door and stepped inside, ready to confront anyone, or anything I saw.

Her room was always a disaster.
Clothes on the floor, toys everywhere, half finished drawings on the desk.

Now it was spotless.
Bed made with perfect corners.
Toys put away in every bin they belonged in.
No clothes on the floor.
Not even dust on the dresser.

I called for my sister.
She came to the doorway and froze.

“Did you clean this? Did she clean this?” I asked.

“No.” Her voice was flat, empty. Then she broke down crying.



The first unit showed up less than ten minutes after I called it in.
Blue lights rolled across the front of the house, painting the walls.
Two uniforms came through the door, calm but moving fast. One of them knew me. He didn’t say anything, just gave a small nod that seemed to say we got it from here.

I holstered my weapon and stepped back toward the kitchen. The energy drained out of me all at once. I could feel the weight of the gun pulling at my belt, the sweat drying cold under my vest.

A detective arrived next, followed by crime scene techs. They moved quietly, professional. My sister sat at the table with a blanket over her shoulders, answering the same questions again and again. I tried to focus on the facts for my statement. Time, location, who found what, but my mind kept jumping back to that room.

A tech brushed powder over the doorframe, then over the dresser. Nothing but smudges. He went to the window next. After a minute he called the detective over.

They had found prints on the inside glass. Small ones. Too small to be mine, too defined to be old.

Outside, the radios crackled. More units canvassing the neighborhood, checking the bus stops, talking to anyone awake.

I stood by the front window watching the reflection of red and blue pulse across the street. Then a voice came over the radio.

“Dispatch, we’ve got something at the bus stop. Another poster. Different photo, same handwriting.”

Everyone in the room went still.

The detective looked at me.
“Stay here,” he said quietly, and headed for the door.

I watched him leave, lights spilling after him into the dark.

I wasn’t about to just stand there so I followed.

The photo seemed to be taken that morning.
My niece standing at the bus stop, backpack on, head turned toward the street.

The detective asked, “You take this?”

I didn’t answer.

Because we both knew I hadn’t.



The detective kept the photo sealed in an evidence sleeve. He told me to go home, get some rest, let them handle the canvass.
I nodded, but we both knew I wasn’t going to sleep.

My sister needed me. My niece needed me.
I walked back to the house to tell my sister what we’d seen. Her world was crashing down around her. She shouldn’t be alone.

I convinced her to grab a few things and come stay with me until we figured this out. With no other choice, she agreed.

We stopped by the precinct to pick up my personal car.
Not many words between us.

I looked over at her.
“We’re going to find her,” I said. “I’m going to find her.”

No response. She just stared out the window.

When we pulled into my driveway, I got out first and grabbed her bag from the back seat.
The porch light flickered once as we walked up.

Something was stuck to the front door.

Even before I read it, I knew what it was.

Another missing poster.

Another different photo.

It was from my birthday.
My niece hugging me, both of us smiling at the camera.

A picture that only I had.
A picture that was in my living room.



The detectives came to sweep my house.

The doorframe showed no forced entry. No prints.
The birthday photo was gone.

That night, sleep never came.
My sister was on the couch, wrapped in a blanket, the TV still playing from where we’d left it. The volume was low, a soft hum under the silence.

I checked the doors twice. Then a third time. Every lock. Every window.

When I walked back into the living room, my sister had finally drifted off, exhaustion winning over panic.
I went to grab another blanket for her.

That’s when I noticed the empty space on the wall.

I couldn’t believe someone had been in my house.
I couldn’t believe ANY of this was happening.

Then I heard it.

A faint whirring sound from down the hall.

I followed it toward my office. The sound grew louder, steady.

When I opened the door, the printer on my desk was running.
Pages spilling onto the floor.

I stepped closer and picked one up.

A missing poster.

Same format. Same bold letters.

Each one a different photo of my niece.

So i flipped my LG UltraGear 4K 240 Hz 31.5"" monitor, the one that has the mode that also does 1080p at 480 Hz with the touch of one button. i paid a lot for it. Too much, honestly. There probably are better options, but i like 1080 sometimes for gaming.

BUT, this morning, drinking my coffee, about to open and read the news, I often flip monitor vertically 90 degrees to read the news, use my AI, reply to forums, etc.

and IDK why, but when i turned it 90 degrees with this particular background image, it showed like the screen was broken and the glass was broken or breaking from within. now i know it's not because i caught it in a screenshot.  But only other owners of these ludicrously expensive, high-refresh-rate, 4k, larger-screen monitors would know the defcon level in my mind went to defcon 1 INSTANTLY; my heart felt like it weighed 100 lbs., and I felt like i was being dumped by my first girlfriend. unexpected, always treated with care, treated her with respect, and then betrayed (monitor or first girlfriend you choose).

I was SO MAD!  Be real. Why would an artist making a desktop painting include this?

Also be real, how would you feel if you woke up for your daily routine and your work and machine, built rather recently, or prebuilt and matched with accessories, or whatever your deal is.

I got to try the Finca El Puente Geisha in the shop which was a real treat. Sadly I got to Fuglen after they closed down the coffee machines for the night, so I had to enjoy a glass of red wine instead (oh darn...). Langøra was an impulse buy from a Kaffebønna location in Tromsø, I don't think it's what they were serving that day but they definitely had the best filter coffee of the places I tried outside of the TW shop in Oslo. Side note, I love the practice of switching coffee shops into wine bars in the evening instead of just closing for the day, is that a Norwegian thing or is it fairly common across Europe?",6,1760189570.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

1o3vp4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/FIlm/comments/1o3vp4h/just_saw_one_battle_after_another_in_vistavision/,Just saw One Battle After Another in VistaVision and just wow…,"I’m not exaggerating when I say that was the best looking film I’ve ever watched. Out of every movie I’ve ever watched in IMAX, or any other format, seeing this projected in VistaVision, the way it was filmed for and made to be seen, was an incredible experience. The image clarity was so high and sharp, and it was honestly comparable to IMAX, while at the same time you could see the dirt and grit from the film stock on the projector. It gave the picture so much more character and definition. The colors and image quality will not be able to be replicated on a digital projector, nor on home release. Seriously, if you have the opportunity to see it in VistaVision, do yourself a favor and take that opportunity. Worth the drive and price of admission. 

I couldn’t tell you the last time I’ve watched a movie projected on an actual film reel. This was like watching a movie from a bygone era. The cinematography was absolutely breathtaking. The best part about it was it made the experience so immersive and didn’t distract from how good the film itself actually was. Acting was full of multiple Oscar worthy performances, PTA is at the top of his game, and the dialogue was probably the best I’ve heard in a film all year. It was funny and effortlessly entertaining. Perfectly paced in my opinion.

For anyone wondering, I was able to go to the Vista Theater in Hollywood, which is owned by Quentin Tarantino. He purchased the theater, renovated it, and reopened it a couple years back, having an adamant rule that all films shown there are only projected on film. All showings are 35mm or 70mm, with a smaller room showing films in 16mm or on VHS. It’s a theater dedicated to preserving the past and history. It is far and away the greatest movie theater I’ve ever been to, and the best theater experience I’ve ever had. You could feel the history and energy within the place radiating. 

Side note, there was an interesting “intermission” in the film around 2 hours in. Some audience member in the very front apparently became disruptive, and a couple of ushers came to tell her to please stop. I couldn’t tell what was going on, because I kept hearing this faint yelling, but I thought it was apart of the film, and thought it was odd or if I was just hearing stuff. Turns out this lady was causing a ruckus, and when they came to ask her to stop, she stood up, began pointing something at the ushers, then at the audience, and at that point, people starting rushing out of the theater. Nobody could tell if she had a gun or not, but we couldn’t tell and weren’t about to take that chance, so the theater cleared out. Everyone ran outside while this person escaped out the back, and I saw her out in the alleyway pointing something telling people to back off, and honestly couldn’t tell if she had a gun or not. We decided to head back in a couple minutes later and the theater staff apologized and resumed the show for us 10 minutes later while locking the doors from the outside. 

Some people thought it was part of the show, and some thought maybe this was some crazed audience member trying to recreate the actions of the film’s characters. This lady was dressed similarly to how the revolutionaries in the film dress and she started talking crazy like them. We had no idea what was happening. Luckily, everything turned out to be fine and those of us that went back in the theater got to finished the showing.

After that I went to Tarantino’s coffee shop attached to the theater, affectionately titled “Pam’s Coffy” and basked in the nostalgia and atmosphere of it. Casually walking beside me outside of the coffee shop was none other than Jack Black, just casually minding his business, not a care in the world. Just a regular dude. I decided to leave him alone and not bother him, even though it was kind of surreal and very cool to see him just being a normal, average, everyday guy just going about his day. He walked away from the shop for a little bit, but came back, and some people noticed him and approached him. He was extremely polite and respectful, being goofy and silly with them, and acting the way you’d expect given his style of humor. Just a very humble and down to earth guy. 

I got myself a souvenir coffee mug from the shop, as well as a complimentary cup of coffee that comes with the mug. 

Definitely simultaneously the greatest and most memorable theater experience I’ve ever had, as well as the most bizarre for our unexpected “intermission.” On a side note, I will definitely return to this theater as often as I can. I only live a couple of hours from LA so I’m hoping I can make it semi frequent. Seeing movies projected on actual film stock is the way to go. Totally different experience. The way films were meant to be seen.

1o3vo1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manifestation/comments/1o3vo1k/how_to_detach_from_someone_i_desperately_want/,How to detach from someone I desperately want back in my life,"Disclaimer/apology for how long this post is about to be, but there's a lot going on here...

I ended the relationship with my ex in March 2024.  We were together for 4.5 years and lived together the entire time. I was sure he was the person I was going to end up with, that we'd get married and that I could finally be done with dating and the frustrations/disappointments that come with it. He felt the same. There was an immediate familiarity when we first met, and shortly afterwards all the horoscope apps I had in my phone would tell me that we had past karmic links, and that we were lovers in a past life, hence the familiarity and comfortability. I genuinely felt like I’d met my soulmate. And I still feel that way today. No other person has ever even come close to the connection I felt with him.

As the relationship progressed, we definitely had our ups and downs. And I don't mean cheating or infidelity, I mean covid lockdown, losing his cat to ongoing health issues, his uncle passing away, and what I think was the real beginning of the end: one of his best friends passing away from drinking himself to death. My ex has always had issues with alcohol, and to be honest, so have I. Our relationship became codependent pretty early on, with each of our own unique dependencies on alcohol being a sort of centerpiece to our day to day lives. We love dive bars, so any excuse to go to our favorites was built into our routine. But he could never just drink a normal amount, it always became excessive. And he would neglect himself and in turn, me and our relationship. It was really all he wanted to do. Drink, sit at home on his phone, watch football, and when football wasn't on, we'd watch tv and movies together. That part I admittedly enjoyed and still miss dearly. We lived like this for years, and eventually my drinking got out of control and I decided to quit at the start of 2024. This is actually what I usually call ""the beginning of the end"" of the relationship. There were more times that I could count throughout the relationship where he swore he was quitting, or at least cutting back, all for it to never last more than a day. And here I was actually sticking to what I said I’d do, and he freaked out. He started drinking more than ever and the neglect reached levels I never thought I’d witness. He was self sabotaging and I could no longer ignore the facts, which were that he was never actually going to change. After a couple of months, I could feel myself losing feelings for him and slowly falling out of love. He could sense this too, so I told him how I was feeling and all of the sudden he kicked it into high gear. He actually quit drinking and started doing tons of stuff around the house for me (which he'd rarely done before, if ever). For some people I think this would have changed their minds and made them decide to stay, but for me, it just solidified what I already knew: that he could have been making these changes all along but only decided to once he knew he was at risk of losing me. He started making me coffee in the morning and bringing it to me in bed, something that I know would have made a world of difference if he'd done it before it all started to fall apart. I ended the relationship on a Monday morning after being gone all day on the Sunday before and coming home to a spotless house, laundry folded and put away (something he'd never done before), and him expecting excitement and gratitude from me. But it all just felt like a big slap in the face. I couldn't pretend to think that we had a chance of turning the relationship around at that point, and I had to end it. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. I remember it like it was yesterday. I’ll never forget the heartbreak in his eyes. He drove to his hometown that day (two hours from where we lived) and I haven't seen him since that day. 

I started seeing someone else very soon after the breakup, 10 days after to be exact. He was someone who I’d always had feelings for but never pursued anything with. We worked together when my ex and I first started dating and for about a year after that. I knew there was something there and felt eager to find out. My ex had been holding out hope that I was going to change my mind about the breakup, and that was pushing me even further away from him. I told him that maybe we could try again in the future, but not this soon because he had too much he needed to work on. I didn't expect myself to be so ready to move on so quickly, but I was. So I made plans to see this person, and my ex found out from checking my location, which I forgot to stop sharing. He was livid and said some pretty hurtful things to me, all of which I remained patient with. I knew how much it hurt him, but I couldn't take back what had happened, and I understood where he was coming from, so I did my best not to be mean in return. I continued to date this person for several months, and my ex and I remained civil because we had planned on splitting up the cats we adopted together over the years and we had to wait until he moved into his new place back in his hometown. So we kept communication minimal and only related to that. To put things into perspective, we broke up on March 11, he moved in with his  friend back home temporarily, and he found a place to move into starting June 1. So I held onto the cats until then. And during that time (I’m going to assume it was somewhere around mid-May based on the pieces I’ve put together) he met someone. He told me about her whenever we started to talk again to coordinate the cats' move (a mutual friend of ours did the transport), which was in the first week of June. He said he'd been ""talking to someone for a couple weeks"" and that he was doing really well. I was honestly happy to hear that. Then he called her his girlfriend which I thought was strange but not all that surprising, and I didn't think much of it at the time because I was so wrapped up in my new relationship, which was going super well at the time. He said he'd been wanting to tell me ""for a while"" that he's actually really glad I ended the relationship, that neither of us were in good places and that I needed to rip the bandaid. He said he obviously still really cares about me and just wants me to be happy and that he's glad that I seem to be doing so well. Again, I was head-in-the-clouds happy with my boyfriend at the time so none of this seemed weird or off to me, but the close friends who I shared it with felt differently. I was told that his new gf is a rebound, that he's painting this picture in order to protect himself, etc...but it didn't matter to me because of where I was at that point. But that would be the start of him wanting to talk to me a *lot*. Like we went from not talking at all during our ""no contact"" phase (some communication here and there regarding the cats but never any real conversation) to him reaching out to me pretty frequently. I learned so much about his new girlfriend that I never asked about or wanted to know. That she and I are both from big families, that they have the same favorite band, that she ""loves pizza more than he does."" It was being thrown in my face so blatantly and I didn't know how to react at first. So we continued this sort of cadence of texting for several months, and eventually my new relationship ended for reasons I won't get into (not the point of this post lol). We broke up in September and I assumed my ex would find out through mutual friends, but I ended up telling him in October or November during one of our many casual conversations. The constant mention of his new gf also continued, and I decided to tell him right before thanksgiving that I couldn't do it anymore. That I wasn't as over our breakup as I thought I was and that the constant mention of his gf is too much for me to handle. I told him it would probably be best if we didn't talk, to which he was totally fine with and understanding of, which devastated me. I was holding out hope that he would express similar feelings or that he'd at least say he didn't want to stop talking. But he made it easy for me, so to speak. We didn't talk for a few weeks, and then he texted me to tell me that our friend had passed away, so the communication opened again. Since then, he texted me once randomly in February to reminisce about an old shared memory, once in April to thank me for sending him a box of sentimental stuff that I found in my house, and I’ve texted him a couple of times in the spring out of desperation to talk to him. The last time we texted was at the very end of April. Since then, the only ""contact"" we've had is me creeping on his Twitter and Spotify, as I’m still desperate for any access to him I can get. 

Maybe also worth mentioning: several months after our breakup when I realized how much I missed him and how devastating losing him was, I did some creeping and I found some Reddit posts of his on the /BreakUp subreddit. He explicitly admits to neglecting me for all those years and admits to the breakup being his fault entirely, and he's posting on the subreddit for any advice on how to forgive yourself after ruining the best thing that's ever happened to you. He posted on the subreddit 3 times, the most recent one being at the end of April 2024. He started seeing his new gf mid-May (at the earliest) 

Now to the real purpose of this post and what I really need help with: I want him back in my life so badly, but I know that I need to detach. Most if not all of the advice I see from other articles say you need to remove physical contact (done), remove communication (done), and focus on yourself and self-care (done and done; I started volunteering this year and it's been life changing, but doesn't make any difference in how often I think about him and am constantly reminded of him). I even moved out of the house that we shared which I thought would be pivotal, but I still see him everywhere. In the movies I watch, the music I listen to, the people I talk to, and in everything I experience every single day. I’ve made tons of new friends and I’ve dated other people, they but always leave me missing him even more than I did before. It doesn't matter how much I remind myself of all the reasons why it ended in the first place and how much he likely hasn't changed, it always feels like I’m just trying to convince myself that I don't want what I know I truly want, which is him. I always come back to feeling like I can't live without him. I’ve been doing ""robotic"" affirmations lately (he loves me, he misses me, he needs me, he can't live without me, he's sorry for what he did, he will text me), but I can't get the voice out of my head that he's happier now with this new person and that he doesn't actually care about me anymore. 

If you've made it this far, thank you so much for taking the time to read my story. Please, any advice at all on how to detach so that I can manifest him back would mean everything to me right now. ",1,1760189326.0,Manifestation,1,1.0,False

My husband, kids, and I are staying in my parents living room for 2 weeks now.","I (29F) am married to my husband (29M) who has terminal cancer. We have two girls, 9 and 3. His health has gone downhill fast this past year — he had a stroke in Nov 2024, two seizures since then, and now he’s doing aggressive chemo. I had to cut way back on work to take care of him.

Since July, I told my parents we might need to move back in for a bit — either until he hopefully gets better, or if the worst happens. They said it would be fine.

Fast forward to now — our apartment management left a letter saying they’re not renewing our lease. Weirdly, I was kind of relieved because I’ve been drowning trying to afford rent, bills, and medical costs. But then my mom calls the same day and says my sister (32F, who’s never moved out) decided to let her online friend and that friend’s two kids move into my old room. Like… what?!

So now, for two weeks, my husband, my girls, and I are all crammed into my mom’s living room. My youngest and I sleep on the recliners, my husband sleeps on a broken couch, and my oldest sleeps in my dad’s room. It’s chaos.

I know I’m extra stressed lately, but I’ve been getting so frustrated. The friend’s 10-year-old wakes up all hours of the night, runs through the living room, makes noise, and turns off the TV (I can’t sleep in silence so it wakes me up every time). They also keep eating my kids’ food. My 3-year-old is autistic and super limited with what she eats — I literally bought a 12-pack of applesauce two days ago, and it was gone. Same with my coffee and whipped cream. Gone in one day.

I get that they’re trying to make themselves comfortable, but this isn’t their home. It’s my parents’. And the mom doesn’t discipline her kids or teach them manners at all.

I’m just exhausted. Between taking care of my husband, trying to work, dealing with money issues, and now living like this, I’m at my breaking point. But my mom and sister keep saying I’m being dramatic and should just “be grateful we have a roof over our heads.”

1o3vmw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/czechrepublic/comments/1o3vmw4/interviewing_for_a_job_in_the_czech_republic_that/,"Interviewing for a job in the Czech Republic that seems really unconventional. Is it an MLM, something else sketchy, or am I overthinking it?","Hey all, I am experiencing some doubts about a job that I have been interviewing for. However, I tend to be overly anxious at times and I want to make sure I am not giving up on something that could be legitimate as I need to find a job fairly soon. 



So basically, I am a foreigner living in the Czech Republic on a working holiday visa. I applied to a finance company that offers financial advising to expats in the country. The idea is that in my position I would be meeting with clients, going through their current financial health as well as their financial goals and putting together a detailed plan to help them meet these goals. This would also involve regular check-ins to make sure clients stay on track. 



At first glance, this sounds fine and was something that definitely interested me and seemed right up my alley. However, I have had two interviews and feel like I am more confused about the job and company than I should be at this stage. I tried to ask good questions, but was met with vague answers. My interviewer first talked about the position as a freelance position, and that they are trying to help people become entrepreneurs and basically operate their own business. And yet, as we later talked about the company’s structure, it was very hierarchical. You go through stages of being a rep, and then you can become a manager overseeing a team of reps, and so on until you reach a more executive stage. This is contradictory and confusing to me considering it is meant to be a self-employed type position.



Additionally, the pay structure was so strange and not like anything I've seen before. You get paid by each unit of work you do. And it was outlined that a typical project is around 100-150 units which should take 4-6 hours of work. When I calculated how that would transfer to hourly pay, the pay seemed too good to be true (to me this is a MAJOR red flag, but I haven’t worked in this industry before so I am not too sure about this). Also, when I asked if the training would be paid, they replied saying that it would be “covered”, to me this sounds like it wouldn’t be paid and rather it would be offered without a fee or something like that, but it wasn’t stated clearly enough in my opinion. I asked about the process for obtaining clients, and it seems it's a mix of obtaining our own while also getting delegated clients from within the team. Again, the question wasn’t really answered in the most clear way :/ 



I also asked for a copy of the notes we went through so I could go over it myself, but was told I could have them once a decision is made but not yet. Given everything, that was a bit frustrating but of course I could understand that choice for confidentiality reasons. 



Lastly, I have had two long interviews online and am now supposed to meet with the interviewer in person this week for coffee. I am supposed to come up with SMART goals for my career and bring them to discuss. I have not been told when a decision will be made and I do not want to get strung along, so I am thinking of asking how many more meetings will be conducted before a final decision is made. Again, I am just a bit surprised that I feel this in the dark so far in. 



I am getting MLM vibes from the whole thing although it doesn’t have the textbook MLM structure that I’ve seen so maybe I am being paranoid. The company has a legitimate website and is on Linkedin with two searchable contacts, although I cannot find any employee reviews or the like which is unfortunate. I just want to know if anyone has had a similar experience or has seen something like this before since it is a first for me. Apologies for the extra long post, and thank you in advance!!

T2 diabetic for one year. I got a CGM + on insulin for my pregnancy and that's when I found out how much black coffee makes my blood sugar rise! 

Before my pregnancy, I was just on Metformin 500mg 2x/day. This seemed to be fine, but to be honest, I don't really know because I didn't have a CGM so I wasn't monitoring my sugars except H1Ac every few months. 

My issue is that I am a VERY slow coffee drinker. I basically just drink one cup from 9 am - 12 pm because I like to drink something while I am studying. 

My question is, does that mean my blood sugar has been spiking all morning even before pregnancy? And if so, should I stop drinking coffee? That would make me very sad.

My insurance won't cover a CGM once I stop taking insulin (after the baby is delivered), so I'm not really sure how to check caffeine's effects on me once my pregnancy is over...

1o3viqz,https://tipstor.io/how-holograms-are-transforming-workers-into-industry-leaders/,How Holograms Are Transforming Workers into Industry Leaders,"The future of workforce training doesn’t come with binders, stale PowerPoints, or tired role-play sessions. It comes wearing holograms. Glowing, immersive, and unnervingly human. The travel and hospitality industry, where precision and human touch still matter, is rewriting the playbook with AI-powered holographic training. The era of onboarding with coffee-stained manuals and grainy training videos is over. The new employee isn’t reading about customer service. They’re standing in a full 3D simulation of a chaotic hotel lobby, managing virtual guests, reading digital body language, and responding in real time.

According to PwC’s 2024 Future of Work report, 58% of global hospitality brands are investing in immersive tech, and holographic training is leading the pack. The combination of artificial intelligence and holography is not just flashy innovation. It’s operational strategy. AI models are now tracking performance data, analyzing emotional response patterns, and optimizing training cycles using lifecycle management systems that would make old-school HR departments blink twice. Every digital trainee interaction is logged, measured, and improved, shaving weeks off onboarding time and cutting costs by up to 35%, according to McKinsey’s workforce analytics data.

It’s not just about efficiency. It’s about immersion. Marriott International has been experimenting with holographic front desk simulations across pilot programs in Singapore and Dubai. Employees are dropped into realistic hotel scenarios, guided by AI-generated mentors who correct posture, tone, and phrasing on the fly. This is learning as experience, not lecture. In another corner of the industry, Emirates Airlines’ new training hub integrates holographic cabin simulations that let flight attendants rehearse emergency procedures in near-real conditions. No VR headset required. No safety risk involved.

AI lifecycle management plays the quiet architect behind the scenes. Orchestrating how data flows through the system, tracking employee growth across digital checkpoints, and identifying who’s ready for promotion before management even asks the question. Predictive models anticipate when a staff member might underperform and suggest personalized modules before it becomes a problem. Deloitte reports that companies integrating AI lifecycle systems into workforce development see revenue per employee rise by 21%.

The trend is spreading faster than expected. According to Accenture’s Global Hospitality Technology Review, the holographic training market within tourism and service industries is projected to surpass USD 1.8 billion by 2026, with AI acting as the core driver of personalization and adaptability. The hospitality workforce, long reliant on human intuition, is now guided by machines that understand empathy through data.

This isn’t the sterile AI takeover some feared. It’s evolution. Digital craftsmanship meeting service artistry. Training no longer ends after orientation. It evolves with the employee. Performance dashboards, sentiment tracking, and feedback loops work in harmony, refining soft skills and emotional intelligence in real time. Each holographic interaction becomes both rehearsal and revelation.

It’s easy to romanticize the old way. The grizzled maître d’ teaching etiquette over whiskey, or the front desk manager showing rookies how to smile without showing desperation. But the world has moved on. The new mentors are light-based, data-fed, and endlessly patient. And in an industry built on human connection, maybe the most human thing AI can do is teach people how to be better at being human.

I live in my own little dream home all alone.

Some may look at my home and think of it as nothing more then a run down cabin, But to me these four walls are the best thing that could ever have happened to me. I have one window in my home, it isn't the biggest but the view is breathtaking in it's own unique way. Others may look out of my window and see nothing but a harsh barren desert without even a road in sight, But to me I see an infinite sea of sand with more grains then i could even hope to fathom.

My home is cozy.

My home is safe.

I have a door and I can leave whenever I want but why would I want to leave somewhere so cozy?

I don't get many visitors but that's just how I like it. I get my food just like anyone else through the mail.

The other day something incredulous happened though. I was sitting down on my sofa and heard a knock on the door. It was a stern and defined knock, No jingle or anything with flair, Just a fist rapping at my door. I was not frightened though in fact I was quite confused if anything. I am no rude host though so I quickly got to my feet and made my way to the door to greet my guest. I grabbed the latch on the door and opened it all the way. I had quite a hearty smile on, I always make sure to smile for guests yes I do. The person standing in my door I did recognize. I could not tell you her name but the moment I laid eyes on her all I felt was fearful. She was a tall thin figure, wearing an all black dress with black lace scarf around her neck and a black veiled sun hat that was so big I doubt any sun had touched the dress as she trekked through the desert to my home. I am Not a rude host so I invited her in, she sat on the couch and lit a cigarette using a glass coaster I owned as an ash tray. I closed the door behind her and stood in front of my Cedar wood coffee table with quite a large smile on my face.

""hello madam, may I offer you a drink or perhaps something to fill your stomach?""

she looked up towards me with a cocked head and without expressing any emotion made a silent yawn.

""I'm sorry I am terribly tired ma'am."" I said before yawning loudly. I still stood before her waiting for some kind of response but thought to myself ""do I even need a response? A good host should always offer a drink even if their guest does not ask for one! A good host should always know the state of their guests well being."" I excused myself from the room and stepped into my quaint kitchen to prepare a glass of water.

""I hope you don't mind I am out of ice!"" I announced from the kitchen before walking back into the living room to hand her the glass. She was still sat where I had seen her last, still staring at me with a cocked head not that I minded of course. she had finished her first cigarette and left the butt to the side of the coaster the ash piled quite nicely in the center of it. I reached for the coaster and smiled at her politely even though I had spilled some of the ash onto the floor.

She furrowed her brow slightly and then stood up from her spot on the couch and just as she did before she made a silent yawn and walked towards the door.

""so sorry about this madam"" I yawned. ""I'd walk you out the door but I am just so tired, please have safe travels.""

She left quietly but hastily, The moment that door closed it was as if I had been thrown into a separate reality. One moment I was standing in the middle of my neat tidy living room with fresh scents from a nearby candle floating through the air, the next moment I was standing in a dark, dusty, filthy den which had a thick stench of rotting food and what I believe was feces. I knew it must have been a different reality entirely because my nice navy blue button up shirt and straight cut khaki slacks had suddenly changed too. I was now wearing stained, torn, damp sweatpants and a white T-shirt that was yellowed with sweat and smelled as if I hadn't taken it off in years. As I was taking in my new surroundings my sudden spell of exhaustion had taken over me and I buckled at the knees nearly collapsing entirely.

""Oh goodness me."" I exclaimed.

""I must take myself to bed immediately I have to be in some kind of nightmare."" I walked through the kitchen and took a right into my bedroom. I had to hold my breath and tiptoe as I made my way through. The stench of rotting moldy food was too over powering, Every surface I looked at was covered in some kind of fluffy white and green mold and around my feet I could see the skittering of rats as they hunted insects and roaches. I finally stepped into the bedroom and my mattress was missing entirely. Where my plush queen sized mattress had once stood was now a pile of clothes and shreds of cardboard. Every wall had yellow drippings from about halfway up all the way down to the floor. There was even a towel in the corner of the room that had probably once been purple or maybe blue but now it was covered in sprouting mushrooms and had a web of mycelium covering it as if a giant spider of sorts had taken it as it's home.

""Oh- oh my."" I had muttered out, My hand covering my mouth.

""How could anyone live like this."" I was utterly baffled at what I had saw. I stepped further into that filthy place and I had approached the mass of stale clothes and cardboard which upon closer inspection had been chewed on food boxes. I felt that lightheaded wave of exhaustion take over me again and I had collapsed at the knees face first into the pile and fallen into a deep sleep.

When I had woken up I was extremely relived to find myself in my room and no longer in that bio-hazard that resembled my home. I walked around skeptically though, Shuffling my feet and touching surfaces that had once been covered in mold or general filth. I kept thinking to myself, Had I gone crazy? Was I sleep walking perhaps? Was any of that real? Or am I in the dream now and all that filth was my actual life. The more I thought of it the sicker it made me feel, Every time I tried to imagine what those yellowish stains on my wall could have been it felt as if a stone had dropped in my stomach. I spent the next few days scrubbing every inch of my home in fear that I was actually imagining my neat and tidy environment or that perhaps one of the many mushrooms that had taken residence among the molds was making me hallucinate. I had nightmares of waking up inside that pile of clothes covered in rat bites and insects navigating through my hair, In these nightmares I would force my eyes shut and do anything I could to fall asleep so I could wake up in my tidy home. One afternoon though, precisely 1:35 pm I heard a knocking at my door that same rythmless knocking. I made my way over, Undid the latch, Put on a hearty smile and let her inside.

""Hello yet again madam, What a pleasure it is to see you today."" I said quite enthusiastically, In fact I was quite happy to see her it helped keep my mind off of my incessant cleaning. Once again though she said not a word and was in the same if not identically clothing as last time, She walked over to the sofa and sat down.

""May I offer you a drink this time? I'm sure I have tea around here somewhere if water doesn't quite catch your fancy."" she stared up at me with a cocked look before opening her mouth to mimic a yawning expression.

I covered my mouth with my hand as I yawned this time and maintained my expression and composure, Although I felt a little drowsy now I felt it would be rude to act in such a way in front of my infrequent guest. She pulled out a bejeweled and gold laden lighter with quite an interesting design on it, She flicked the flint a few times but a spark did not hold and as she held it away from her face to inspect it I caught myself staring at it and spoke up.

""U-um excuse me ma'am if I may.."" she stopped inspecting the lighter and flicked her head to me and had almost a furious look on her face.

""Sorry I know this is quite rude of me to ask but if you must smoke I'd prefer you smoke outside, I just scrubbed the walls you see and.."" she quickly stood up and walked towards me she was mere inches from my face where she looked deep into my eyes before backing off and stepping out onto the porch.

I don't think she smoked outside though, She stood outside for maybe one or two minuets before coming back inside. She made another silent yawning face towards me and then walked right back out of the door and left for the day, I wasn't even able to say goodbye or react past my deep yawn which had now made me feel quite unbelievably drowsy. I threw my arms into the air to stretch and when I had opened my eyes I was once again thrown into that nightmarish realm just like the last time she had come over. My breath began to quicken and I began to feel panicked, The house had seemed even worse off since the last time I had been here. the noises from the street didn't help ease me either, Sounds of cars honking, People yelling, And the sound of what could be gunshots or fireworks followed quickly by sirens. I started fiddling with my hands and murmuring to myself, Anything to calm down.

""oh god oh god."" I shuddered to myself and I began tugging at my hair and earlobes. I didn't even realize how hard I was tugging until i saw strands of hair fall before my eyes with the follicles still attached. I had so many terrible thoughts racing through my head, It felt like my head was a race track for nascar or something I couldn't focus on anything in particular and everything was happening so fast and my ears were getting red and sore from all the tugging and my hair stopped falling in strands it was now chunks and I started scratching at my arms till they were rubbed raw and it was all too much it was just too too much I just screamed, I screamed and screamed and screamed.

I slammed my body into the front door before flinging it open and stumbling out into the hallway. My body felt so weak that even though I could feel the adrenaline coarse through my veins and my heart beating out of my chest I could barley walk straight. My vision began to get starry and black out a little. I was breathing so hard that's all i really remember while blacked out like that. some sirens some incoherent yelling perhaps and then I ended up here. Who was she do you think?

It’s been 5 months since my last update, and I must say… the cryptoverse continues to deliver comedy gold.

DOGE is sitting at $0.19, ADA (ASSDA for my fellow survivors) is $0.65, and SOL is $183 proving that the universe really does reward chaos, memes, and maybe insider trading.

Reddit is celebrating like we’ve entered “the new bull run.”
You know… the same “new bull run” that’s announced every 4 months like a Marvel reboot.

I had to check if I was on WallStreetBets or a group therapy forum titled “Coping with Delusion: A Crypto Journey.”

Let’s revisit the “investment thesis” from last year:
	ADA would dethrone Ethereum.
	DOGE was “digital gold.”
	SOL was “the future of finance.”

Meanwhile:
	ADA is still writing peer-reviewed whitepapers about maybe launching an app.
DOGE is waiting on Elon to tweet again like a dog waiting by the door.
And SOL is pumping because… reasons. (Probably just people escaping ADA.)

Had you dropped $5,000 into each back when the prophets on YouTube screamed “BUY THE DIP!”
you’d now have a portfolio worth roughly $6,700 after surviving three “market resets,” two “halving hype cycles,” and one nervous breakdown.

That’s right up 12%… if you ignore inflation, taxes, fees, and the fact you’ve been checking CoinMarketCap every 4 hours like it’s a life-support monitor.

Meanwhile, my boring savings account is still quietly compounding and not once has it called me “early” or “diamond-handed.”

People are back tweeting,

	“Alt season is coming 🔥🔥🔥”
which at this point feels less like financial advice and more like a cry for help.

I saw someone post,

	“ADA to $10 this cycle fr 🔒🧠”
and I swear I could hear Charles Hoskinson laughing from his ranch.

Anyway, I’ll end this update the same way I started the last one:
I’m still free.
Still making coffee instead of cope.

Neighbourhood helpers: looking after each other, right here in (street)

Hi, I’m (name) from (Street).

I’d love to get to know more of my neighbours and at the same time, build a simple, local way for us all to help each other out when life gets busy or tough.

It’s fair to say (city) has been feeling a bit flat lately, everything costs more, people are stretched, and it’s easy to feel disconnected from the folks just down the road. (suburb) Roots is our little street’s way of making things a bit easier, warmer, and kinder, starting small and close to home.

We’re starting small, just the lower half of (Street) for now, to keep things easy and personal. If it works well, hopefully others will start their own little groups too, and it’ll grow naturally across Ngaio.

Taking part in (suburb) Roots just means being part of a friendly network where we share what we can: meals, rides, tools, garden produce, time, or just good company. Everyone chips in differently, and that’s what makes it work.

Accepting help never means you owe anyone. Lending, sharing, or helping out doesn’t create any kind of debt, it’s just neighbours looking after each other. Things come and go, favours circle back in unexpected ways, and it all balances out over time.

Everyone gives and receives in different ways, at different times. Sometimes you’ll give more, sometimes you’ll need more, and that’s okay.

It’s not charity or obligation; it’s neighbours helping neighbours, the way communities can and should. A small way to make (suburb) stronger, safer, and a bit kinder.

Everyone’s welcome, families, singles, renters, homeowners, newcomers, long-timers.
We all bring different backgrounds and ways of doing things, and that’s what makes this work.

So long, my friends. In this video (where I try to act normal), I’m showcasing my latest progress on my independent 3D animated web series; entirely made in Blender! Still using Blender, still learning new tricks to trick you into opening the gate to “the other side.” I’d say I’m halfway through. Well, maybe 56% done; the remaining 44% will be about recording the dialogues, animating, crying, and drinking coffee. Stay tuned to see if I make it to the finish line (which is… pretty soon, hopefully).

What’s inside this video:

3D modeling & low-poly environments inspired by Japanese suburbs Urban world-building and surreal

indie storytelling Japanese culture & pop culture references (you’ll see what I mean)

The slow descent into Blender-induced insanity: step one, lol

•”I don’t think Heavenly Father is really that worried about coffee/tea/alcohol. Kombucha helps my gut, and the WoW is about health first.”

•”Tattoos aren’t a big deal in the 21st century. They used to discourage them because they used to be culturally viewed as ‘for sailors and convicts’ but we’re in a different time now and that’s why they’re no longer explicitly discouraging them. They never formally forbid them anyway!”

•”I don’t think wearing my garments at all times is that big of a deal. Jesus wants me to live the gospel and be a good person, he’s not that worried about what kind of underwear I have on. I pretty much just wear it to sacrament meeting.”


What I never hear is:

•”I don’t think Heavenly Father is that worried about which type of genitals people are attracted to. I think we should allow all forms of marriage in the temple, not just heterosexual.”

•”The Family: A Proclamation to the World isn’t a big deal in the 21st century. It came from a time when alternative forms of gender expression were seen as ‘for psychos and pedophiles’ but we’re in a different time now and I think people should express any gender or sexuality they choose.”

They are nuanced about things that allow them to bend the rules and enjoy a less restrictive lifestyle, but still believe in their hearts that they get to go to the Celestial Kingdom. But they could never extend that nuance to LGBTQ+ people, people struggling with substance use, or really anyone who doesn’t still fit very closely to the typical Mormon mould.

1o3v9r3,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1o3v9r3/interviewing_for_a_job_that_seems_really/,"Interviewing for a job that seems really unconventional. Is it an MLM, something else sketchy, or am I overthinking it?","Hey all, I am experiencing some doubts about a job that I have been interviewing for. However, I tend to be overly anxious at times and I want to make sure I am not giving up on something that could be legitimate as I need to find a job fairly soon. 



So basically, I am a foreigner living in a country that I am not native to on a working holiday visa. I applied to a finance company that offers financial advising to expats in the country. The idea is that in my position I would be meeting with clients, going through their current financial health as well as their financial goals and putting together a detailed plan to help them meet these goals. This would also involve regular check-ins to make sure clients stay on track. 



At first glance, this sounds fine and was something that definitely interested me and seemed right up my alley. However, I have had two interviews and feel like I am more confused about the job and company than I should be at this stage. I tried to ask good questions, but was met with vague answers. My interviewer first talked about the position as a freelance position, and that they are trying to help people become entrepreneurs and basically operate their own business. And yet, as we later talked about the company’s structure, it was very hierarchical. You go through stages of being a rep, and then you can become a manager overseeing a team of reps, and so on until you reach a more executive stage. This is contradictory and confusing to me considering it is meant to be a self-employed type position.



Additionally, the pay structure was so strange and not like anything I've seen before. You get paid by each unit of work you do. And it was outlined that a typical project is around 100-150 units which should take 4-6 hours of work. When I calculated how that would transfer to hourly pay, the pay seemed too good to be true (to me this is a MAJOR red flag, but I haven’t worked in this industry before so I am not too sure about this). Also, when I asked if the training would be paid, they replied saying that it would be “covered”, to me this sounds like it wouldn’t be paid and rather it would be offered without a fee or something like that, but it wasn’t stated clearly enough in my opinion. I asked about the process for obtaining clients, and it seems it's a mix of obtaining our own while also getting delegated clients from within the team. Again, the question wasn’t really answered in the most clear way :/ 



I also asked for a copy of the notes we went through so I could go over it myself, but was told I could have them once a decision is made but not yet. Given everything, that was a bit frustrating but of course I could understand that choice for confidentiality reasons. 



Lastly, I have had two long interviews online and am now supposed to meet with the interviewer in person this week for coffee. I am supposed to come up with SMART goals for my career and bring them to discuss. I have not been told when a decision will be made and I do not want to get strung along, so I am thinking of asking how many more meetings will be conducted before a final decision is made. Again, I am just a bit surprised that I feel this in the dark so far in. 



I am getting MLM vibes from the whole thing although it doesn’t have the textbook MLM structure that I’ve seen so maybe I am being paranoid. The company has a legitimate website and is on Linkedin with two searchable contacts, although I cannot find any employee reviews or the like which is unfortunate. I just want to know if anyone has had a similar experience or has seen something like this before since it is a first for me. Apologies for the extra long post, and thank you in advance!!

My head softly hums from too much coffee. It’s Saturday morning, I’ve been up since 2:30 AM not able to sleep. I’m not overly tired, but I will be soon, I’m sure. Insomnia has been my lot for many years now. Lately, it’s been better. But not today. It makes the ache of loneliness that much more urgent. Life is passing me by, and I’m scared. I go for walks and write poetry to try and keep the wolves at bay. Sometimes it works; sometimes it doesn’t. 

I’m quiet, gentle, and introverted. I love philosophy, foreign films, history, and literature. I love deep conversations and hearing your thoughts on everything. I’m agnostic and a leftist. Though I’m not anti-religion. Kurt Vonnegut summed up my ethics when he wrote, “there’s only one rule: Goddamn it, you have to be kind”. I try to live by this, but I fail more often than I like. Lately I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how to keep the spark of human kindness alive, when the whole world sometimes seems hell bent on extinguishing it.

 I’m 6’5”, brown hair, and bluish green eyes. My body type is average. I’m happy to exchange SFW pictures when we are both comfortable. I promise I will quote too many Bright Eyes and Leonard Cohen lyrics. 

I’m ultimately looking for my person. But I know these things take time. I would love to learn more about you. What’s the last song you listened to on repeat? Who is the artist who’s art you like the most? Who is your favorite filmmaker? You don’t need to answer these questions if you don’t want to. But if anything I’ve said caught your attention, please reach out. I’d love to hear from you. I can’t always immediately reply. Regardless of whether I hear from you, I wish everyone the best on their search. I know how lonely it can be trying to find a partner. ",0,1760188103.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.5,False
1o3v7sp,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1o3v7sp/the_charlie_kirk_assassination_has_resulted_in_me/,The Charlie Kirk assassination has resulted in me being bullied at work.,"For context, I am 25 years old and work at a Bay Area startup as the assistant CFO. 

Alright, so the day after the Charlie Kirk assassination, which was like what a month ago (?) we were talking after the meeting about what had happened and my boss said “a 200 yard shot is nothing, I could make that shit with my eyes closed” after one of my coworkers said she thought it was a professional hit. My boss turned to me and asked me if I thought I could hit a 200 yard shot and escape off the roof, and I said no because I’ve never shot a gun before. This triggered a huge amount of laughter from everyone and people started calling me “Chris Murphy” and shit which was kinda weird and annoying. 

When I showed up to work the next day my boss called me into his office and while hiding behind his desk hit me square in the neck with a nerf rifle and said “YOU GOT KIRKED MOTHERFUCKER”. Alright, that was pretty funny. A week goes by and a poster goes up on the wall with an AI age-enhanced image of John F. Kennedy and the caption in meme font “JFK if (my name) was the shooter”. People would come up to me and make jokes about me being a gun control extremist, etc. I’ve also been getting with nerf bullets while I try and get up to make coffee etc. 

On Friday one of our Angel Investors came by the office and had a speech about doing what you’re passionate about in life, yada yada yada. One of the interns raised her hand and said “(my name) is passionate about a complete repeal of the second amendment and banning violence in video games”. Everyone started laughing and my boss screamed out “CHRIS MURPHY 2028”. Several people were crying because they were laughing so hard. 

I don’t want to seem like a bad sport but this seems kinda unfair and isolating. Advice?

I started it because I was honestly tired.

Every small founder or indie builder knows this feeling -
Leads everywhere.
No proper follow-ups.
Support messages missed.
10 tabs open just to handle one customer.

I remember replying to a user at 1:40 AM who said -
“Hey, I filled your form last week, no one got back.”
That hit hard.

That’s when I realized - I didn’t need another CRM.
I needed something that could actually understand my work.
Something that talks with users, connects tools, and just works without stress.

So I started building EasyBotCRM.
Not for others first - for myself.

Day 1 was nothing fancy - just me, a coffee, a whiteboard, and chaos.
The goal was simple -

A bot that understands what users want

Builds forms on the go

Connects to Zoho, HubSpot and more

Lets me use my own OpenAI key

My brand, my domain, my control


I’m not building another shiny AI toy.
I’m building something that gives me peace.

If you ever built something because every other tool made your life harder -
you’ll understand.

1o3uxst,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1o3uxst/my_inner_voice/,My inner voice,"I used to think I talked to myself a lot.
You know, that inner monologue everyone has — reminding you what to buy, replaying arguments you lost, narrating your day when you’re too tired to think straight.

But lately, I’m not sure it’s me doing the talking.

It started small. I’d be getting ready for work and hear myself think something like, “Don’t forget your keys.” Normal. But then, one morning, I heard, “Don’t take your usual route.”

It didn’t sound like a thought. It was clearer, sharper — like a voice you hear in the room rather than in your head.

I laughed it off. Took my usual route.
There was a car accident two blocks down — some guy blew a red light at the intersection I always cross.

That shook me up, but I told myself it was just coincidence. Everyone gets weird thoughts.

But it kept happening.

The voice started giving me little warnings:
“Don’t answer that call.”
“Wait another minute before you go inside.”
Every time I ignored it, something minor but bad happened. Dropped my coffee, missed the bus, or got caught in a sudden downpour.

After a while, I started listening.

And it worked. My days ran smoother. I felt calmer. The voice wasn’t intrusive anymore — it felt… helpful. Like an older version of me, looking out for myself.

Then last week, it told me something new.
“Don’t talk to her.”

I was at a café, waiting for my order, when this woman smiled at me. She looked normal — warm smile, friendly eyes. We started chatting. The voice got louder.
“Stop talking to her. Now.”

My chest tightened. My heart started racing.
She noticed I looked pale and asked if I was okay.

The voice screamed, “SHE’S NOT REAL.”

I panicked and left my coffee behind. When I glanced back through the window, she was still there, but she wasn’t looking at me anymore — she was staring straight at the chair I’d been sitting in, eyes wide, like she was afraid of something I couldn’t see.

That night, the voice spoke again, soft this time:
“Good. You listened.”

I asked out loud, “Who are you?”

And it said, “You let me in. I’m the part of you that knows better.”

Now it talks more often. It tells me who to avoid, what not to say, when to stay quiet.

It’s always right.
Always.

The only problem is, it started giving me one instruction over and over these last few days:

“Don’t go to sleep.”

And I can’t tell if it’s protecting me from something—
Or if it’s waiting for me to be too tired to fight back.

Monique texted early in the morning:

> “Hey girls, movie treat’s on me! Meet at the mall at 2 p.m.! 🍿🎥”



By noon, I was already too excited to sit still. Mom laughed seeing me fidgeting while brushing my hair.
“You’re acting like it’s your birthday, Amy,” she said.
“It’s not, but it’s movie day!” I told her.

When we all met at the mall—Kira, Penny, Carmen, Winfrey, Siu Ling, Monique, and me—Monique was grinning like she had a secret.
“You’re all gonna love this one,” she said, waving the tickets. “It’s called The Navel. The tagline says: ‘The Bond of Sisterhood Never Cheats.’”

The title alone made us curious, but we didn’t expect to get this emotional.

The movie started in that futuristic, glowing-city world that looked just like Tron! Everything was black and neon blue, with digital roads stretching forever.
The main character, Kelly Yang, was a computer engineer searching for her twin sister Katrina, who vanished three years ago while creating a mysterious programme called The Navel.

When Kelly found the old office and accidentally re-activated the project, the whole theater gasped—she got pulled into a digital dimension! And her outfit suddenly turned into this sleek, light-lined suit. Winfrey whispered, “Whoa, she looks like she’s part of the code now.”

Then came the wild part: glowing red enemies called the Rippers started attacking, and a mysterious woman on a Lightcycle saved her. When the woman took off her helmet—everyone in the cinema went silent—it was Katrina!

Carmen whispered, “Oh no way, that’s her sister!” and Kira grabbed my arm.

The sisters’ reunion scene was beautiful. Kelly cried, saying she thought Katrina was gone forever. Katrina smiled and said,

> “He cheated you, Kelly. But sisterhood—sisterhood never cheats.”



We all froze. That line hit hard. Even Penny, who usually jokes through every movie, sniffled and said, “That’s… actually deep.”

Then came the twist: Kelly’s boyfriend, Jack Rydinger, was the villain all along! He had been using Kelly to steal Katrina’s programme data.
Kira muttered, “Ugh, I knew he was too nice.”

The final battle was incredible—neon lights, explosions, and the two sisters fighting side-by-side, their energy syncing together. The part where Katrina transferred her data through her glowing navel into Kelly’s system to save the day had everyone gasping.

At the end, the sisters returned to the real world, exposed Jack and his father’s corruption, and rebuilt their company together.
When the credits rolled, the whole theater clapped.

As the lights came on, Monique turned to us and said, “See? Totally worth it.”
Winfrey nodded. “Best sci-fi sister movie ever.”
And I said, “That line’s gonna stick in my head forever.”

We walked out quoting it dramatically:

> “Sisterhood—never cheats!”



It became our new inside joke.

That night, I told Mom and my sisters about it during dinner. Even Jennifer smiled and said, “That sounds like my kind of film.”
Gillian started imagining what it’d be like if we were in a digital world together—Linda said she’d hack the system for snacks, and Nina said she’d open a virtual coffee shop.

The first winter storm of the season is rolling in — snow down to 3,000 feet this weekend.  
The leaves have turned.  
Mornings call for sweaters and strong coffee.  
Change is on the way.

Ruger and Cocoa are already getting furry for winter, and I’m reminded that some seasons don’t end quietly. Sometimes the wind takes what we thought would always stay, and the best thing we can do is stop chasing what’s already left.

Change and growth aren’t always pretty, but they’re honest.

Final edits of the affirmation book have been anything but pretty — long nights of hunting the right words and mending what didn’t land true. Not fun, but necessary if I want to reach the future I’m aiming for.

Growth isn’t always graceful, but it’s real. And one day, when the dust settles, we realize that what remains is lighter, truer, and finally our own.

To anyone walking through a hard change right now — this isn’t falling apart.  
It’s just the shift of seasons.

1o3ujse,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o3ujse/i_cant_see_it_but_everyone_else_sees_the_mirror/,"I can't see it, but everyone else sees the mirror at the foot of my bed.","My room is rather plain. When people are over and peek inside the cracked door they always mention how little I have in there. A bed, a desk, my wardrobe, and a few little trinkets with a plant littered around the space.

Honestly, I never really am much for interior design so I don't mind being a minimalist.

Although my friends and family always ask about my mirror. The first time someone inquired about it, I was surprised because, well, I don't own a mirror. The only one I have is in my bathroom—but everyone would insist that I do in fact have one. It's up against the wall at the foot of my bed, they'd say. ""It's hard to miss!"", is another common one.

I would play along after a while, sometimes chuckling about the running joke those closest to me have, forgetting about the giant mirror, so crazy!

Sometimes when it was late and I was settled into bed, I'd try to peer into the darkness to make the frame out—pitch black nothingness would beckon back. Countless sighs in frustration would follow.

""You added a drawing to the framing?"" My friend Amy called from 'round the corner. The book I have in my lap shuts with a thump, I roll my eyes as I pad over the wooden flooring of my apartment to Amy, my door wide open.

I purse my lips, ""No I haven't. It's the same as always,"" I lie.

She gives me a look, crosses her arms, taps her foot. Her rhythm in threes of fours, like a waltz.

""Seriously. I haven't done anything to it. Why what does it look like?""

Amy glances back through the doorway, her shoulders start to tense, and as she turns her face looks crumpled.

""You really don't see the drawing?"" She pushes again, ""It's... honestly kind of creepy. I didn't realise you had that talent.""

I weave past her into my room, no mirror that I can see. Amy squeezes past me then, a blur of motion before I could even blink and then a piece of paper is pressed right in front of my face.

...I didn't even see her grab it. Yet, there it is. A piece of flimsy paper, colours swirling about in odd directions, with no sense or reasoning. To me, it looks almost nauseating.

Her hands inch away with a snap of her wrist, turning the paper towards her, ""Dude, I'm like, freaked out to be honest. You got everything right, I never even told you about this.""

My heart picks up at that, ""What the fuck are you talking about?"" Face red and warm, I start to sway and feel light-headed.

""You drew my @h3#p, Thomas,"" she replied, her tone thick and scratchy. Amy looked like she was going to pass out. My throat tightened.

//

I never really understood what Amy said. Trust me I tried to and I asked about it several times. Amy would always dodge the question though, even after I begged. She just would get mad and say to look at my own drawing. 

It was a lost cause trying nowadays. Truthfully after that I refused to let anyone into my room—I bought a lock from Bunnings and always kept it shut tight whenever people would come over. Lest I'd have to deal with the uncomfortableness and the shock like Amy felt.

It became more and more common for friends and family to visit literally the day after my lock was hastily installed. Like everyone heard a rumour that my room had weird drawings like Amy's, and they'd insist that they didn't want to come over just because of that.

The mirror. The invisible mirror. Every single time and no matter whom it was would ask to see it. For a couple of hours, William, Mum, Amy, anyone really; they would talk about nothing in particular. Updates about their lives, we'd sometimes go out or eat in. I liked it. I encouraged anyone who walked through my apartment door to be themselves, vent about anything.

The topic would always come up—sometimes an outright question, other people were more sly about it.

""Can I see your room?"" Innocently enough. At first. Maybe they wanted to see my plants, or other random excuse. I just know now it's always about that goddamn mirror. I fell for it a couple of times, and everytime it happened whatever drawings they'd come across; later on they'd look at me all funny. Despite that, they'd still beg to come over for a chat or a coffee.

I was sick of it. I wanted to smash it to pieces. See the glass litter the floor. 7 years of bad luck be damned!

//

I wake up with my head all fuzzy, the shapes in my room blurry and unfocused. Everything usual, from what I could make out. I look at the foot of my bed—no mirror. My head hits the pillows and I groan. My alarm blares and wails in agony before my palm sinks on-top of it. The static-like silence plunging right in afterward, my eyes still trying to focus enough to read the time.

From the corner of my eye I notice a figure, my breath catches as I lock my gaze to my desk like I've been frozen by Medusa—the dark figure just standing there. Its inky fingers slowly reaching up, and up, and up, until it finds where it wants. Then as soon as I realised it, the thing ups and leaves just like that.

I've been holding my breath all this time; shaky exhales with sharp tingles burn my lungs and throat as I gasp for air.

First of all, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to those who are about to spend their precious time reading my post. Maybe after reading this, we’ll have a chance to talk or maybe we won’t. Either way, I truly wish you find someone who’s right for you. My post will be quite long because I want to make everything clear before you decide to message me. Once again, thank you so much.

**I’m looking for a connection that grows genuinely over time from both sides.** ***Whether it turns into friendship or something more, I always value friendship first. because I believe real love comes from the time and effort we put into getting to know each other. Having friends from different places isn’t bad at all***. ***So let's be friend first, and let time show us what comes next.***

I don't do voice call ! I prefer chatting over voice calls.

>**ABOUT YOU?**

**- Age: 28 - 35**

**-** Single (of course)

\- I just hope that if we’re on the same page, you’re serious when messaging me. Being serious doesn’t mean boring - it just means genuinely wanting to get to know each other.

\- I hope you’ll be open with me, because that’s important for us to build a real connection, right? I don’t mean you have to open up too much the first time we talk, we can just take our time and slowly get more comfortable and open with each other.

>**ABOUT ME!!!**

\- I'm Vietnamese and also live in Vietnam, you can see lot of pictures that I took in Vietnam and also Vietnamese food. **Time zone doesn't matter. It depends on whether both of us want to spend time together or not.**

\- I'm 23 years old, I know it might seem unusual for a  to want to talk to people much older, but I often interact with older folks - they’ve helped me think things through and I’ve learned a lot from them. Of course, not everyone is perfect, but I really value the experience.

\- **Appearance:** 5'7 , chubby , glasses, brown eyes, black long curly hair (not natural), I don’t really judge whether I’m beautiful or not. I’m just a simple girl who doesn’t wear much makeup and prefers a modest, comfortable style.

\- **Personality:** **straightforward** (I’m straightforward, but that doesn’t mean I don’t respect you or being rude) , sometime I **swear a lot** and I need people who don’t get bothered by that or we can do that together. Honestly, I don’t really know how to describe myself. Sometimes I’m a very energetic and cheerful person, but other times I’m quiet and deep in my thoughts  and that really affects my mood. Everyone has their own way of seeing me, eople see me differently, depending on their point of view.

\- **Hobbies**: going to museum especially history museum (even though I'm not good at history), reading romance novel, take picture from my phone - i dont have any a digital camera because I take pretty bad pictures, I don't play game much but I like watching Streamer play horror game and learning about that storyline - (Resident Evil, Silent Hill, etc) , love cookinggg so much, I’m an indoor person, but lately I’ve been trying to find reasons to go out more, to take photos of beautiful scenes and share them on Reddit. I really enjoy sharing the pictures I’ve taken. I love coffee and beer - I always want to try every kind of those.

**My hobbies are pretty simple, nothing too special or cool. But I don’t mind hearing about yours and learning from them.**

**- Music:** Rap, Pop, R&B, Instrumental music and EDM, also Vietnamese, English and Spanish songs.

**- Movie:** Rom-com, comedy, action, Marvel (BIG FAN), sometime horror. I also love to watch How I met your mother, Modern family, Shameless, Brooklyn 99, Fresh Off The Boat, etc. **And a lot of cartoons, I also love Family guy - giggity goo!!!**

1o3ujr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1o3ujr7/my_arranged_marriage_meeting_went_south_fast/,My Arranged Marriage Meeting Went South Fast,"Hey Reddit, I swear this happened to me last month, and it's got me questioning if arranged marriages are even worth the hassle. I'm a 28-year-old IT guy from Mumbai, and my parents have been on my case about settling down. They found this profile on a matrimony app girl from Delhi, 26, works in marketing, seems chill. Horoscopes checked out, families chatted on the phone, and we planned a meet at a neutral spot, a cafe in Delhi since I was there for work.  
  
I show up with my mom and dad, she's there with her parents and an aunt. We order coffee and snacks, start with the usual small talk: jobs, hobbies, where we grew up. She's nice, but I can tell right away we're not vibing she's super into spiritual stuff like yoga retreats, and I'm more of a Netflix-and-chill type. No biggie, right? These things happen.Then her aunt pulls out her phone with our birth charts and starts analyzing. ""Your Venus is weak, beta might lead to compatibility issues."" My mom jumps in defending me, saying astrology isn't everything. Things get a bit tense, but we move on. Next, her dad casually mentions expectations for the wedding not outright dowry, but hints at ""helping with setup costs"" and gifting a car or something. My parents are progressive and shut that down politely, but you could feel the awkwardness building.   
  
As we're wrapping up, trying to decide if we want a second meet, her phone buzzes non-stop. Turns out it's her cousin texting about some family emergency back home nothing major, but it derails the conversation. Then, out of nowhere, she mentions she had a bad breakup recently and isn't sure she's ready for this. Her mom freaks out a little, whispering loudly about not airing dirty laundry. My dad tries to lighten the mood with a joke, but it lands flat.  
  
The vibe turns sour quick. Her family starts arguing among themselves in hushed tones aunt blaming the stars, dad saying we should've vetted better. Priya (fake name) looks embarrassed and excuses herself to the bathroom. We wait like 10 minutes, and she comes back saying she needs time to think. My parents suggest we call it a day, but her dad insists on discussing ""next steps"" right then, which leads to more back-and-forth.  
  
Finally, we all leave on weird terms no commitments, just polite goodbyes. Later that evening, I get a text from her apologizing, saying her family pressured her into the meet and she's not over her ex. Blocked the app, told my folks to give me a break. Now they're mad at me for not ""trying harder,"" but dude, it was a disaster waiting to happen.",14,1760186224.0,Arrangedmarriage,14,0.86,False

we met up 4 days ago to go for drinks after she finished work, i went and i felt the vibes where off. i don’t know why or how but they just where, i felt awkward and didn’t know what to say half the time. she was less all over me to me too, which is ofc fine but i was confused and so i asked if she was okay and she kept saying yeah but i knew deep down something was wrong, fast forward to when we got to my car after we left.. we sat for a while and it was just silent, i kept asking her what was up and then she just kept saying she was fine to me at that point i knew she wasn’t but i didn’t know what else i could do. i finally got it out of her and she told me she just felt stressed and overwhelmed by everything going on in her life, which i understand and i told her i want to be there for her when she lets me be. 

she has started a new job so i do understand how she has been really tired and exhausted. i sat and gave her a little talk about how much i care for her etc and she then came around and started talking more, everything felt fine in the end before i left her home. we kissed and hugged goodbye and it all felt okay. 

now yesterday i text her with a goodmorning and asked if she would like to meet on saturday (today) before she goes to work for a coffee date or something and she text me something around the lines of “hey i need to get something of my chest, i think i need space” and on how she feels she can’t give me the consistency of love and kindness that i give her right now.. which is why she needs space and how it’s not fair on me. i text her back being very understanding and caring towards her, i always told her if she needs space that’s 100% okay i will of course give her that if she needs it, she didn’t reply back to me all day after that and i’ve been feeling quite anxious about it. 

i uploaded a story yesterday onto my instagram and she viewed it immediately and it really made me feel awful because i know she’s ignoring me, ofc she asked for space but she hasn’t gave me any details on what she meant by it. 

i text her last night again saying “I’ve been thinking about this all day :( I don’t want to overwhelm you, but it’d mean a lot if we could talk so I can understand better 🫶🏻”. i really care about her, i do. she means the world to me and i am so scared of losing her, obviously that’s a me problem i’ve to deal with that myself and i understand that but i just want her to communicate with me on how she’s feeling and what she wants. 

her saying she wants space could mean lots of things, at least to me. does she mean space from hanging out? or does she need to take a step back from talking to me? i’m just really lost and confused, my hearts hurting because i’m so uncertain on what is happening :( 

i want to give her the space that she asked for but being so uncertain about what’s going on is really hard for me to deal with from day to day.

I didn’t even open the message and now am scared to interact with anything on twitter or even open the app. I can’t get it off my mind tho. As soon as I got free time I just started playing some video games. I know I will eventually go lurking again and probably relapse.

There is a 16-year age gap between me and my husband. I’m 30, he’s 46. We’ve been married for 3 years and we have two children. His career is his top priority. He has climbed to the top of the hierarchy in a very large company

We met a few years ago when I was working at the same company. He is Polish and I am Slovak. We in Slovakia have been some sort of outsourcing for the plant in Poland that he was leading. He always spoke down to my department because customer service it seems is very low. I knew from my boss that he said we are "" trash"". But it wasn't personal for me at that point. I did meet him face to face when he was probably ""forced"" by headquarters to come to Slovakia and meet us. He didn't even answer to my hello. not to my colleagues. He did go out for a coffee with the leader of the customer service but that was it

I wanted more career wise and I moved to Poland myself internally, directly to the plant.  We basically got to know each other from scratch — he  had divorced recently. Even at the plant there were like 7 layers between us. I am in no managerial position. But we met actually outside of the office - its a medium size city and we started talking. Due to internal regulations I changed companies so I can have a real relationship with him. He helped me to find a job somewhere else and we became official. Got married within a year. And he helped me get back at the plant too, nothing prestigious. Just back on the position I was in. I didn't ask for favours. I don't report to him, but we found a workaround and I report to the headquarters.  

We have a daughter and a son. Our daughter is only a few months old. He barely spends any time with them, but now he wants another baby.  He comes home always tired, always irritated, and he has daily conflicts with his subordinates. He doesn’t waste time with friends; when he’s not at the office or out working, he’s home with us, but he’s either sleeping or on his phone, always talking about work and stressed out.  I am not ready for another baby but maybe in a year or so. However, I will return to work soon, so at the plant he leads and I checked some emails, looking for key words. I found an email with a long chain and at the bottom of it was an email from him saying that all those... Sl0vaks are doing tr#sh work and he wants to get rid of them because they are all a bunch of barely out of high school ""philosophy"" students who came here to take our people's jobs.

Cutlery is an essential part of every dining experience, blending functionality with style. Whether it’s a family dinner, festive gathering, or casual meal, the right cutlery set can elevate your table’s look and make every bite enjoyable. But what is [**cutlery**](https://fns.co.in/collections/fns-cutlery), and how does each piece serve a distinct purpose? Let’s explore the various types of cutlery and their uses to help you choose or upgrade your next cutlery set wisely.

# What is Cutlery?

Cutlery refers to the collection of hand-held tools used for preparing, serving, and eating food. Traditionally, it includes items such as forks, knives, and spoons. In modern times, a cutlery set may also feature specialized utensils for specific cuisines and occasions. Apart from functionality, cutlery also reflects culture, dining etiquette, and personal taste.

A good [**cutlery set**](https://fns.co.in/collections/fns-cutlery-set) not only complements your dinnerware but also enhances your overall dining experience. Stainless steel, silver, and gold-plated finishes are the most popular materials, each adding its own charm and durability.



# The Main Types of Cutlery

# 1. Table Knife

* The table knife is the most commonly used item in any cutlery set.
* It has a slightly rounded tip and a smooth or micro-serrated edge for cutting soft foods like grilled vegetables, poultry, and cooked meats.
* It’s usually paired with a fork and placed on the right side of the plate.

# 2. Table Fork

* The table fork is used alongside the table knife.
* It typically has four tines that help in picking up solid items like rice, vegetables, paneer, or meats.
* Indian meals often adapt the fork’s use for continental dishes or when eating outside traditional Indian styles.

# 3. Dessert Spoon and Fork

* Smaller than standard-sized spoons and forks.
* Used for desserts like custards, puddings, and cakes.
* A dessert fork generally has wider tines to help cut soft sweets easily.

# 4. Soup Spoon

* The soup spoon features a round bowl, designed to hold liquid comfortably without spilling.
* Ideal for serving soups, rasam, or even desserts like kheer.

# 5. Teaspoon

* One of the most versatile pieces in any cutlery set.
* Commonly used to stir tea or coffee, measure ingredients, or serve small condiments.
* Often found in households across India due to its everyday practicality.

# 6. Butter Knife

* A small knife with a rounded edge used for spreading butter, jams, or spreads.
* Unlike a sharp knife, it ensures smooth application without cutting through bread.
* Usually placed on a side plate during breakfast or high tea servings.

# 7. Steak Knife

* Features a sharp, serrated blade for cutting tougher meats like steaks or kebabs.
* Found mostly in Western-style cutlery sets, though increasingly popular in Indian homes as dining preferences evolve.

# 8. Serving Spoon and Ladle

* These are larger spoons used for serving rice, curries, dals, or gravies.
* A ladle has a deep bowl with a long handle, making it ideal for serving soups or sauces.
* Every Indian household typically keeps at least a few serving spoons in different sizes.

# 9. Salad Fork and Spoon

* Used as a pair for tossing and serving salads.
* The long-handled design allows easy mixing and transferring of greens, fruits, or dressings.



# Materials and Maintenance Tips

**Choosing the right material is as important as selecting the type.**

* **Stainless steel cutlery**: Durable, rust-resistant, and easy to maintain. Perfect for daily use.
* **Silver cutlery**: Elegant and traditional; often reserved for festivals, weddings, or celebrations.
* **Gold-plated or designer sets**: Trendy options for stylish dinner parties or gifting.

**To care for your cutlery set:**

* Wash and dry immediately after use to prevent water spots.
* Avoid harsh scrubbers that can scratch the surface.
* Store pieces neatly to prevent damage or bending.



# Why a Good Cutlery Set Matters

Beyond function, cutlery helps define your table’s personality. A well-chosen cutlery set makes dining comfortable, showcases attention to detail, and leaves a lasting impression on guests. For Indian households balancing both traditional and modern cuisines, a versatile cutlery set is a must-have investment.

Whether you’re setting up your first home or refreshing your dining collection, understanding the [**different types of cutlery**](https://fns.co.in/blogs/news/what-you-need-to-know-about-cutlery) and their uses will help you combine practicality with elegance each time you sit down for a meal.

* Verify trips by uploading a ticket (keeps chats real & spam-free) or join with limited messages if you’re just checking a city out
* Share and browse activities/photos from the people actually there (hidden gems, cheap eats, nightlife, rentals)
* DM privately from profiles to find your next trip BFF
* Get notified when your city access is approved & when someone messages you
* See upcoming trips in your profile so you can coordinate meetups ahead of time

1o3u93m,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimMarriage/comments/1o3u93m/husband_not_lowering_gaze/,Husband not lowering gaze,"I don’t even know where to start. I’m 28 and have been married to my husband who’s 29 for six years. Allah blessed us with two beautiful daughters, ages 4 and 5. I truly believed our marriage was good. We had normal ups and downs but nothing major. That all changed earlier this year.

My husband reconnected with a childhood friend who’s 27. He’s Muslim and had been living in the UK for the past seven years finishing his degree and building his career. He recently moved back to the UAE with his wife who’s 25 and Christian and their baby boy. When they came back, the four of us went out for dinner so the men could catch up and so we wives could meet. I noticed right away how beautiful she was. She’s honestly one of the most stunning women I’ve ever seen, with mixed features and such a unique look. My husband noticed too but the dinner went fine. They weree both really nice people and I actually liked her a lot. My husband even complimented her looks during dinner and I agreed, not thinking much of it.

Soon after, his friend asked if my husband could help his wife find a job. They both studied pharmaceutical science so it made sense. I encouraged him to help and he connected her with people at his workplace. Alhamdulillah she found a job quickly and my husband even helped her adjust to working in the UAE before she started. At that time I didn’t think anything of it.
Eventually she and I became close. We started going out for lunch or coffee and I really enjoyed spending time with her. My husband and his friend also got closer again. Everything seemed fine until one day after a beach trip with both families. On the drive home my husband suddenly told me I needed to keep myself more fit and put more effort into my appearance. I was shocked. I told him I’ve had two kids and my body isn’t the same anymore, though I’m not overweight. He brushed it off and said now that the girls are in school I have time to work on myself. Then he compared me to his friend’s wife and said she had already snapped back into shape just months after giving birth.

That comment broke me. It made me feel insecure and jealous. I don’t want to dislike her because she’s genuinely kind and hasn’t done anything wrong. She doesn’t flirt or act inappropriately and she clearly loves her husband. But I started noticing how my husband looks at her. At one dinner he couldn’t take his eyes off her. He was fully focused on everything she said and smiling the whole time. She didn’t seem to notice but I did, and it made me wonder if he’s been like this all along?! 

He’s also constantly praising her and her husband. He talks about how they travel, how educated she is, how interesting she is, how supportive she seems. When I tell him he’s obsessed with another man’s wife he denies it and says she’s just an interesting woman. He’s even said things like his friend was lucky to travel before marriage or that marrying a British woman gave him a better life, implying he wishes he’d done the same instead of marrying me.
It got worse when they mentioned going to Bali. My husband said, “If we had two incomes, we could afford to travel too.” It was clearly aimed at me, criticizing me for being a stay-at-home mom. It made me feel like everything I do for our home and kids doesn’t matter.

Since May I’ve been noticing every time he compares me to her or uses her as a reason to put me down. It’s destroying me inside. She has no idea and she’s completely innocent in all this. She’s actually my only real friend here, someone I truly care about. But now my husband has turned that friendship into something painful. If I cut her off I lose the only person I feel close to. But if I keep her around I have to keep watching my husband’s obsession grow.

He doesn’t lower his gaze, he doesn’t respect me, and he keeps telling me to go to the gym with her or try to look like her. Just last week he spent about fifteen minutes talking about how perfect she is, how she’s an amazing mother, wife, and working woman. I ended up crying afterwards.
I’ve begged him to stop. I told him I would tell her husband if he keeps it up. He doesn’t care.
Now I feel trapped. If I leave him I have nowhere to go. My parents have passed away, my brothers are busy with their own families, and I don’t have a degree or a job to fall back on. I only have my daughters. But if I stay, I’m stuck with a husband who constantly compares me to another woman and makes me feel small.

I keep thinking divorce might be the only way out, but it would leave me with nothing. I don’t know what’s worse anymore, staying or leaving.

I’ve been dealing with a burning sensation and pain right at the beginning and end of urination. It started after I had a retained tampon, which led to treatment with metronidazole. After that, I developed thrush and then a UTI (and had antibiotics and topical methods for both).

Since then, I’ve had multiple urine samples and swabs done, but they all came back showing no infection or anything unusual. I recently saw a uro-gynaecologist who said she thinks it’s the aftermath of everything — basically, all the antibiotics wiped out both the bad and good bacteria, and my system just needs time to reset.

She advised me to stay hydrated and avoid fizzy drinks, coffee, and alcohol. She’s also going to do an ultrasound to make sure everything looks okay. If that’s clear, she plans to give me some antiseptic treatment and believes the symptoms should gradually ease over time.

I’ve read that others have gone through something similar, so maybe she’s right, but I can’t help worrying — what if something else is going on? I just want to stop being constantly aware of the discomfort down there.

In the meantime, I’ve bought some D-mannose and having warm baths to soothe the area, plus making sure to wear breathable trousers.

Has anyone else had this kind of lingering burning or irritation even after tests came back clear? How long did it take to feel normal again?

I hope you are all well and appreciate any guidance! ❤️",4,1760185300.0,Interstitialcystitis,2,1.0,False
1o3u8cr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1o3u8cr/controlling_husband_or_am_i_overly_sensitive/,Controlling husband or am I overly sensitive ?,"Hi all

I am looking for advice and I guess validation that I haven’t gone crazy ..
I left my husband about a year ago due to ongoing controlling/pedantic/perfectionistic behaviour 
I often worry if I was just too sensitive because he has many good qualities that I do miss 

The controlling behaviour was an ongoing issue over many years and actually improved somewhat when I nearly left him years ago.. however despite this & counselling, it seems it is within his personality to be this way & I reached my limit 
Some recent examples include
- constantly criticising / “telling me off” for my food choices because it would be a negative influence on the children (e.g crackers etc), telling me off for too much coffee etc 
- constant monitoring and control of the children’s food as well as how they dressed (often changing their outfits that I had dressed them in if he did not like them) - this would involve telling me off for what I would offer/feed my children & I almost resigned all control
Of this by the end of the relationship 
- not “allowing” me to drink (being uncomfortable w it)
- criticising my clothing when he did not like it
- overriding many of my parenting decisions 
- sexual coercion? - sulking and or persistently badgering me for intimacy whereby I generally gave in to keep the peace 
- CONSTANT groping whereby I got to the point of hiding when I would get dressed etc 
- always being right .. 
- constant calling / messaging 
- control over our schedule - dismissing my ideas for family outings - I ended up giving up any control of this too & would resign to his control on weekends 
- being depressed when I would go out with friends .. I would be so riddled with guilt & anxiety during outings that I didn’t feel they were worth it most of the time 

There were SO many more examples but I feel I almost have a level of amnesia and struggle
To articulate everything that went on 

Thoughts ? Am I being too sensitive ?

1o3u85j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1o3u85j/considering_a_3_day_fast_to_help_with_severe/,Considering a 3 day fast to help with severe anxiety due to 2 months of sudden and extreme pain caused by inflammation.  Looking for recommendations or suggestions.,"About three months ago, I came down with a really bad viral infection, which my doctor just chalked up as a bad cold. It lasted for about three weeks and they just kept pushing over-the-counter medications on me. Eventually they put me on a 6 day steroid pack and after this didn’t help, they put me on antibiotics. This seemed to finally sort out the issue, but the day after starting the antibiotics my blood pressure to spiked to extreme and dangerous levels (190/120). I’ve never had an issue with my blood pressure ever before and was always around 110/70 prior. I ended up in ER where they ran tests but they couldn’t find anything to be the cause. It took about a month for my blood pressure to return to basic normal levels while on blood pressure medication.

In turn, about a week after the BP spike, my body went through an extreme bout of inflammation which caused severe and crippling pain to run through my shoulders, chest and back. My doctor had me on very high doses (1200mg daily) of anti-inflammatory medicine as well as gabapentin to help mitigate the pain along with muscle relaxers. I ended up needing to have a cortisone shot in one of my shoulders just to get it to move again as I could hardly lift if from my side. 

After about two months, I’m finally starting to feel better and nearly back to normal but as a result, my anxiety has peaked to levels I’ve never had issues with before. I’ve been on Welbutrin 150mg for a few years which I started after my mothers passing and my Dr recently also started me on Buspar 5mg 2x daily) to try and help. The anxiety attacks come multiple times daily and willl usually last a few hours and it’s crippling because I’m consistently thinking that something is wrong and I’m fixating on it from a health perspective. This also feeds the next bout. 

I’m doing everything I can to help with my anxiety, including meditation daily exercise (daily I either run between 3-5 miles, bike for 20 miles or swim between 2000-3000m. I also eat very clean, get around 7-8 hrs of sleep a night, only drink water along with 1-2 coffees in the morning. 

I’m just sort of at my wits end and I don’t know what else to do. I’ve always been an anxious person, but this is at the extreme end for me looking for any suggestions to help get my mental health back into order because I know this is not doing my body any good. 

Would love to hear from anyone who’s dealt with this before or has any suggestions.

Imagine unlocking a simple secret that can transform your daily cup into a richer, more energizing brew.**

The key lies in the Coffee Hack ingredients—a clever blend that can boost flavor, aroma, and even your focus. Keep reading, and you’ll discover exactly what these ingredients are and how they can change your coffee routine forever. Don’t miss out on this easy way to upgrade your mornings!

# Essential Coffee Hack Ingredients

Essential Coffee Hack Ingredients bring new life to your daily brew. They turn ordinary coffee into a special treat. Simple additions can change taste, aroma, and texture. These ingredients make coffee more enjoyable and exciting. Knowing the right ingredients helps you create your perfect cup. Here are some key groups of ingredients to try.

# Spices To Elevate Flavor

Spices add warmth and depth to coffee. Cinnamon is popular for its sweet, woody taste. Nutmeg offers a nutty, slightly sweet flavor. Cardamom gives a fresh, spicy note that brightens the cup. Cloves bring a strong, aromatic punch. A pinch of black pepper adds a subtle kick. These spices mix well with coffee’s natural bitterness. Experiment with small amounts to find your favorite blend.

# Sweeteners And Their Impact

Sweeteners balance coffee’s bitterness and enhance flavor. White sugar is simple and widely used. Brown sugar adds a richer, molasses taste. Honey brings floral sweetness and smooth texture. Maple syrup offers a unique, earthy flavor. Artificial sweeteners work without calories but can taste different. Each sweetener changes the coffee’s profile. Try different types to discover what you like best.

# Dairy And Non-dairy Additions

Dairy adds creaminess and softens coffee’s edge. Milk and cream are classic choices for smooth texture. Half-and-half creates a richer, thicker cup. Non-dairy options suit those avoiding lactose. Almond milk gives a nutty, light flavor. Oat milk adds a mild, creamy taste. Coconut milk introduces a tropical twist. These additions change both taste and mouthfeel. Choose based on your dietary needs and flavor preference.

# Extracts And Flavor Enhancers

Extracts deliver concentrated flavor without bulk. Vanilla extract is popular for its sweet, warm aroma. Almond extract adds a nutty, fragrant touch. Peppermint extract gives a refreshing, cool note. Cocoa powder enhances coffee with chocolate tones. Salt, in tiny amounts, reduces bitterness and brightens flavor. These ingredients intensify coffee’s taste. Use sparingly to avoid overpowering your drink.

# Choosing Quality Coffee Beans

Choosing quality[ coffee beans](https://gomehedi.com/best-coffee-beans-for-home-coffee-machine/) is a key step in making great coffee. The right beans bring out the best flavors. This affects the taste and aroma of your coffee. Knowing about bean types and roasting helps pick the best beans for your brew.

# Types Of Beans And Their Tastes

Arabica beans have a smooth and sweet flavor. They often have hints of fruit and sugar. Robusta beans taste stronger and more bitter. They have more caffeine and a heavier body. Liberica and Excelsa beans are rare. They offer unique flavors, sometimes smoky or fruity. Pick beans based on your taste preference.

# Roasting Levels And Flavor Profiles

Light roast beans keep more original flavors. They taste bright, fruity, and acidic. Medium roast beans balance acidity and body. They are richer and sweeter. Dark roast beans have a bold and smoky flavor. They lose some original taste but gain bitterness. Roasting affects aroma and strength. Choose roasting based on your flavor choice.

# Techniques To Boost Coffee Aroma

The aroma of coffee plays a big role in the overall taste experience. Strong, fresh scents make each cup more enjoyable. Simple techniques can help enhance the coffee’s natural aroma. These methods keep the coffee fresh and rich in flavor.

# Grinding Methods For Freshness

Grinding coffee just before brewing keeps the beans fresh. Whole beans hold their aroma longer than pre-ground coffee. Use a burr grinder for even, consistent grounds. Avoid blade grinders that create uneven particles. A fine grind suits espresso, while a coarser grind works for French press. Fresh grinding releases oils that carry aroma and flavor.

# Brewing Tips For Maximum Flavor

Use clean, cold water for the best extraction. Water quality affects taste and aroma greatly. Keep the brewing temperature between 195°F and 205°F. Too hot water can burn the coffee. Brew time matters; too short or too long weakens flavor. Pre-wet the coffee grounds to let them bloom. This releases carbon dioxide and improves aroma.

# Combining Ingredients For Unique Blends

Combining ingredients creates coffee blends that stand out. Each mix brings new flavors and aromas. This process allows coffee lovers to enjoy something fresh and exciting every time. It also helps discover tastes that suit personal preferences perfectly.

Using the right ingredients in the right way makes all the difference. Simple combinations can produce classic tastes. Bold mixes can surprise and delight the palate. The secret lies in balancing flavors to make each cup unique.

# Classic Flavor Pairings

Classic pairs blend well-known tastes with coffee. Vanilla and cinnamon add warmth and sweetness. Chocolate and hazelnut bring rich, nutty notes. These combinations create smooth, comforting drinks. They please those who enjoy traditional coffee flavors.

Milk and sugar remain favorites for many. They soften coffee’s bitterness while keeping its essence. Such blends are easy to make at home. They offer a reliable, tasty experience every time.

# Innovative Ingredient Mixes

Innovative blends push beyond tradition. Spices like cardamom or star anise add exotic hints. Coconut milk or almond cream introduces creamy textures and flavors. These mixes create new coffee experiences.

Experimenting with unexpected ingredients can reveal hidden favorites. A pinch of sea salt enhances sweetness. A touch of chili adds a surprising kick. Creativity in coffee making leads to exciting discoveries.

# Health Benefits Of Coffee Additives

Coffee additives can do more than just change the taste of your drink. They can also improve your health. Many natural ingredients added to coffee offer vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. These help your body fight illness and keep you strong. Adding the right ingredients turns your coffee into a healthy boost for your day.

# Natural Boosters And Their Effects

Spices like cinnamon and turmeric add flavor and health benefits. Cinnamon helps lower blood sugar and fight inflammation. Turmeric contains curcumin, which supports the immune system. Coconut oil adds healthy fats that improve brain function. Ginger helps digestion and reduces nausea. These natural boosters make coffee more than just a drink.

# Balancing Flavor With Nutrition

Choosing additives that taste good and nourish your body is key. A small amount of honey can sweeten coffee and provide antioxidants. Almond milk adds calcium and vitamin E without too many calories. A pinch of cocoa powder gives a chocolate taste and antioxidants. The goal is to enjoy coffee that tastes nice and supports your health.

# Storing Ingredients To Maintain Freshness

Keeping the ingredients fresh is key to making great coffee hacks. Fresh ingredients keep the flavor strong and the drink tasty. Proper storage stops ingredients from going bad or losing their aroma. It also helps avoid waste and saves money.

# Proper Storage Tips

Store [coffee beans](https://gomehedi.com/best-coffee-beans-for-coffee-maker/) in an airtight container. Keep the container in a cool, dark place. Avoid sunlight and heat near the storage spot. Use glass or metal containers with tight lids. Do not store coffee in the fridge or freezer. Moisture affects the beans and changes their taste.

For powders like cinnamon or cocoa, use sealed jars. Store them away from heat and moisture. Keep sugar and sweeteners in dry containers. Check containers often for any clumps or changes. Use dry spoons to avoid adding moisture.

# Shelf Life Of Common Additives

Ground coffee usually stays fresh for 1 to 2 weeks. Whole beans last about 3 to 4 weeks after opening. Cinnamon powder can keep flavor for up to 6 months. Cocoa powder stays good for about 1 year. Sugar has an almost unlimited shelf life if kept dry.

Milk or creamers need refrigeration and last about 1 week. Plant-based milks vary but usually last 7 to 10 days once opened. Always check the expiration dates on all ingredients. Use older ingredients first to reduce waste.

1o3u6rm,https://www.reddit.com/r/moreplatesmoredates/comments/1o3u6rm/why_women_only_swipe_on_a_tiny_proportion_of_men/,Why women only swipe on a tiny proportion of men - an evolutionary theory,"*Disclaimer: This post got removed from the other subreddits I submitted it to. It may also get removed from this one. Ah well. I thought it was an interesting theory, but I'm not sure if there any communities left that would actually entertain these ideas.*

We've probably all seen those charts that illustrate how men swipe/rate women in a fairly linear fashion, whereas women are only attracted (on a superficial level, at least) to the very highest percentile of men (examples [here](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-preview.redd.it%2Fa_EmTKqDBsg3QClvakuZZreDMzjQR-NtQz5u6KHXDdo.jpg%3Fauto%3Dwebp%26s%3D0afc4745eb55a66025f2fda71c24d07a119dc47c), [here](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Frqditxsfd9hc1.jpeg), [here](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F8wzwio329so61.png), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fexploring-how-men-and-women-perceive-each-others-v0-erxhaqu289hc1.png%3Fwidth%3D1080%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Dbc4beb74a122e632e8e15f68ec9b2d3b1e04c3a3)).

There are a multitude of sociological factors, I'm sure. But I have a theory that assuredly accounts for some of the physical aspect of it. The majority of our sexuality is shaped by primitive, evolutionary forces, right? Now, as we all know implicitly and many studies have confirmed (like [this one](https://bonytobeastly.com/most-attractive-male-body-survey-results/)), women's primary bodily preference for men is lean and moderately muscular (something like [this](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1150711565/photo/attractive-brunette-young-naked-man-in-bathroom-towel-drinking-a-cup-of-coffee-posing-to-the.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=XWTSI0ZekmO9wTztpAA5mpwvpG0_o78ILoxVJgd4xs4=) or [this](https://www.malemodelscene.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Useful-Tips-for-Improving-Your-Career-as-a-Male-Model-4.jpg)) - basically a male model physique.

However, men are typically much more tolerant and even embracing of curves (like [this survey](https://bonytobombshell.com/most-attractive-female-body-survey-results/) alludes to). I personally prefer curvy women. Most of my straight male friends would prefer curves over skinniness as well. Of course, that's not universal and 'heroin chic' is certainly still lauded, but typically, some added fat heightens women's femininity, especially if it translates into a more exaggerated hourglass figure.

Anyway, the average man in his mid-late twenties in most developed countries sits at around \~22% body fat. That's not fat, but it isn't lean. It's 'soft'. And it's a body composition that would basically be unseen in our ancestral environments. And that's just average, you wouldn't even consider that 'chubby', and a huge percentage of men have considerably more adiposity.

The biggest issue with sitting at a body fat percentage above 20% is that it massively dulls the masculinity of the face - your jawline blurs, your cheekbones get padded over, and your entire face loses its sharpness. Look at [this Instagram model](https://www.instagram.com/p/CGCsy3RlYqD/) (swipe through the pictures). He is objectively beautiful, but even when he gained a *very modest* amount of fat to bulk up, his facial structure was considerably obscured. He regressed from looking like one of the most aesthetically attractive men you'll ever see to a *relatively good looking guy*. There's also the time when Jared Leto gained weight for a role - [here ](https://www.elitebodysquad.com/cdn/shop/articles/28_1024x1024.jpg?v=1502283159)and [here ](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/DNY94G/jan-19-2006-new-york-ny-usa-jared-leto-in-a-fat-suit-costume-at-the-DNY94G.jpg)\- he gained 60lbs, which is admittedly a lot, but his facial transition is the most dramatic aspect: he went from one of the most handsome men in Hollywood to someone who is unlikely to even get a handful of matches on a dating app. He is objectively ugly afterwards.

Leanness and facial attractiveness also have a non-linear relationship. I can't directly cite my sources but I remember reading a lot about it. Basically, 10 - 14% is generally the range in which it impacts the face most favourably (for men), but after 20%, it drops dramatically. As in, it's not a gradual decrease each percentage point gained, it's a dramatic aesthetic drop.

This perfectly aligns with my experience. I'm in my late twenties. I've worked out on and off all my life and I would consider myself 'moderately muscular'. However, in the last few years my body fat percentage had slowly crept up to around \~20% after having previously been quite lean in my late teens and early twenties. Earlier this year, my relationship ended and I decided to get back into shape and dropped down to \~13/14% body fat (I lost about 15lbs of fat but seemingly maintained virtually all of my muscle). The difference in people's perception of me is ridiculous. I was never unattractive but I get far more compliments these days - my face is defined, my forearms are vascular, I've had much more success on dating apps and I've even been flirted with in public.

Anyway, I'm not great with brevity, what I'm trying to say is that due to our modern lifestyles, both men and women have more fat than they would have in our ancestral environments. On top of all the other gender-based asymmetries in dating, men are considerably more tolerant (and sometimes drawn to) curves in women, whereas women are almost entirely repelled by added fat on men (even if it just translates to a slightly softer face). In a primitive environment, virtually every man would be lean, and the body types available would more strongly align with what women find attractive even to this day, assuming the absence of genuine malnutrition. Almost every celebrity, actor, musician, and well-known 'pretty boy' in the media that attracts a spate of female attention is very lean - even the most attractive models in the world would be considerably less striking if they possessed as much additional fat as the *average* man does.

Anyway, I'm interested to hear all of your thoughts.",3,1760185155.0,moreplatesmoredates,13,0.67,False

so I'm an art grad student and it's the middle of the semester right now. 3 weeks ago I dislocated my shoulder and couldn't do any studio work (painting, drawing) for a week. im taking 3 studio classes that require 6-8 hrs work a day on a normal basis.  I had communicated with all of my professors with documentation and they all daid to catch up when possible. I received an email late a week ago today saying my professors gave me a deadline to get caught up with late work by this coming Monday and also be able to submit current work tha5 is due on Tuesday. I have been working in the studio for 15++++hrs each day staying up until 3 or 4 then getting up grabbing coffee then sgraight to working  with  2 10 min breaks and 15-20 for lunch, since last Sunday to try to get caught up.  The work load of art grad students is a lot, and the mental work load is a lot more than most people think because it's art.  I've told my husband and daughter that i need them to take care of things, that is I can only eat, sleep, and work if im going to make these deadlines. (i know my work load isn't sustainable it's just until Tues). he gets stressed from work which i get. The teen has been utter chaos emotionally and not doing what she should be doing. Husband has also been going to bed really early (I understand he is tired but...), which is usually when I discover something that has to b3 addressed with the teen and it escalates. . I've had to do some chores that they were supposed to do but I they didn't, it still needed done so I had to do it (catbox wad really bad, dirty dishes at lead5 need rinsed because we hav3 a cat that likes to lick pans to get the food)..... same with dinner, it gets to the point where it's either it won't get cooked if I don't make something, or Im asked to do it. I've never had to work this hard in my life. I'm so stressed. If I don't meet the deadline I get an F and then I'm kicked out of the program. 

I did implode and told husband I need him to do more.  He said I need to tell him what to do. My first reaction is I shouldn't have to tell you, that I've told you I need both of you to take care of everything. that includes cooking, cleaning, dealing with the teen. It felt like everything I said was thrown in my face. he said he understands I'm stressed and had just been taking my moodiness. That he has been working since he was 18 so he understands and needs me to communicate better.       ....I had already said I needed them to step up. I have said many times that I'm just trying to survive this mentally and physically.  feel like my whole life is falling apart. When he worked 12 hrs shifts I tried to get what he needed done, handled mom duties, so that he could eat, stay up for an hour then sleep. We did that for years before he got into management. It wasn't perfect but I made sure what he really needed  was done.

I did tear up a drawing. It needed to be redone anyway it looked bad because My brain isn't really functioning and the professorof that class would not have accepted it looking the way it did.

I just needed to be anywhere but where I was and didn't want to talk so after I imploded and they went to bed (which was right after argument). I went for a drive after turning my location off.

am I over reacting?

I will be purchasing the 5080 variants.

* Alienware - Great aesthetics, especially the glass window and the new color. Great cooling that ensures good performance. However, it weighs way too much at 3.6kg MORE THAN 18INCH LAPTOPS. It is also very thick, almost 30mm.
* Legion Pro 7i - Much thiner and lighter than the Alienware, has good build quality and overall a great laptop. Just not too keen on the glossy OLED display because of the reflections and the potential burn-ins.
* ROG - Another solid option, with the Mini LED display. However, I don't like the maximalist approach with the LED grid and surround RGB lighting, feels overwhelming.

I don't need the laptop to be too portable, but it still needs to be carried around to the office and places like coffee shops. The laptop will always be used on a desk. With black friday around the corner, I can grab one of these three laptops for a good price.
