All the noise from Google Maps, TikTok, even the posts here where super hard to keep track of. 

So, I slowly started keeping track of different places, cafes, restaurants, bars, and events, and collated everything into an app that I had developed. I showed it to a friend recently, and they said I should try and get it out in the open and see if it'll help other people too.

About six months ago, she told me she ‚Äúneeded space.‚Äù Not a breakup, just breathing room. She said she was overwhelmed and needed time to think. I didn‚Äôt want to lose her, so I gave her what she asked for - no pressure, no guilt. Just space.

We texted a little at first. Then less. Then nothing.

One day I saw her tagged in a photo with someone new. Same city, same coffee shop we used to go to, same smile - just not for me.

No goodbye. No closure. Just a fade-out.

And here I am, six months later, still wondering if giving her space was just an easier way to disappear. I thought I was doing the right thing. Now I just feel like I got ghosted by the person who knew me best.

1ldhfta,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ldhfta/aita_for_not_replying_to_my_friend_after_she_made/,AITA for not replying to my friend after she made a dumb joke?,"I (19M) have a friend, let's call her Sarah (19F). So Sarah and I are not that close, throughout last year we saw each other maybe once a week. But to be honest, I did want to become closer friends with her. She is a really nice, witty and intelligent person, while also sharing my sense of humor and a few of my interests. I can't stress enough how wonderful of a person she is, though sometimes things do get awkward and/or weird with her, which until this incident wasn't an issue for me. 

So a month ago me and Sarah talked about hanging out sometime, just the two of us. We decided to go out for coffee when we were in person, and even decided on the date and place. A week passes and it's the day before the date we agreed upon. I text her asking if we are still going out tommorow and then...silence. She didn't reply to me that day, the next day, and the day after that. 

5 days later I finally get a text from her, but at the time I was confused if it was really her and not a hacker using her account, because the reply I received was ""Sarah has been in a coma since [the date isn'timportant]"". I freaked out, like REALLY freaked out. I had no idea what to do and just tried comforting myself and telling myself it was a hacker and she was totally okay. I couldn't muster any strength to reply to her that evening, and only did so the next day after consulting some of my friends on the situation. Pretty much all of them thought she was hacked too. I also checked social media of all of our shared friends and no one seemed to know or acknowledge anything like that happening to Sarah. So I reply the next day just asking ""What..?"" and then again, total silence for 3 more days. 

3 days later I get a text saying ""That's right, this is not a joke"" at which point I am not only confused, but also mad. I don't care if people reply to texts a few days later, I do that all the time so who am I to judge. I consider that a totally normal thing because you can't know how busy or willing the person is to answer and so he/she doesn't have to reply immediately if he/she doesn't want to. But this is different, this was just a weird thing to joke about and a weird thing to text so long apart about. I get that I could have just asked her friends if she's okay, but that's not the point. I don't care that she made me really worried, I care that she made such a weird joke and ignored my texts about us going for coffee even though she's the one who suggested it and who constantly reminded me about it. 

So it's been a month and we haven't texted each other since the last text I mentioned. I am still convinced that it's all a joke and that's why I am still upset at her and don't really want to text her. 

So am I the asshole for being angry at her and not trying to reach out, or is my crashout reasonable?",2,1750147325.0,AmItheAsshole,3,1.0,False

Chapter 1

‚ÄúMom, about what Dad said years ago‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve decided to go through with it. Tell him to arrange the marriage.‚Äù

I ended the call, and the music flooded back in. Audrey‚Äôs birthday party was still in full swing.

Audrey‚Äîthe girl I once saved from bullies, who I thought was my best friend.

Jared, my boyfriend, and Jackson, my closest childhood friend, changed the moment Audrey entered our lives. Suddenly, she was their everything. They laughed with her, cared for her‚Ä¶ and eventually, they told me they loved her. Right to my face.

Then came the dinner. Just the three of us. A final attempt to fix things‚Äîso I thought. But when Audrey called, crying about being robbed, they left me. Again.

It was raining. I wandered the streets, soaked and alone, until I was hit by a car. They never even bothered checking on me.

So I packed my bags. Booked a flight. Met my groom.

Then I sent Jared and Jackson one last message: My Wedding Invitation.

\--

‚ÄúAbout what father said years ago‚Ä¶‚Äù I paused, my voice barely rising above the music thumping through the villa walls. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm now agreeing to get married. Please tell him to arrange all the prep work. No need for romance‚Äîmake it just formal.‚Äù

There was a moment of stunned silence on the other end before my mother‚Äôs familiar voice broke through. ‚ÄúAre you sure about this? What about your boyfriend, Jared? Did you finally break up with him?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot yet,‚Äù I replied, firm but tired. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell anyone about this yet.‚Äù I swallowed the ache in my throat. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll send the other list for the agreement and return home as soon as possible.‚Äù

Then I hung up. The phone slid from my hand and dropped onto the soft mattress beside me. That‚Äôs when the noise outside clawed its way back into my senses.

It was Audrey‚Äôs birthday. The adopted daughter of my parents. The girl I once thought of as my little sister. The same girl I‚Äôd defended from bullies back in high school, when the four of us‚Äîme, Audrey, and my childhood friends Jared and Jackson‚Äîwere supposed to be a family.

Back then, I thought I was doing the right thing. That helping her would bring us closer. That we could all live in one house and laugh over dinner. I never imagined she‚Äôd twist everything.

Audrey was clever like that. She‚Äôd wormed her way into everything. She used to tag along with us‚Äîme, Jared, and Jackson. I didn‚Äôt mind. At first. But then it was like she started trying to replace me. Whispering things to Jared when I wasn‚Äôt looking. Making Jackson laugh in a way that used to be just mine. Still, I told myself not to overthink it.

But then I saw it. The kiss. It was supposed to be a quiet night. Just me and Jared who eventually became my boyfriend as we both confessed our love. Then, I caught him and Audrey kissing.

I let it go‚Äîfor a while. But it happened again. And again.

Every time I asked, Jared brushed it off. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just jealous,‚Äù he‚Äôd say. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs like a sister.‚Äù

Jackson said the same. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ruin everything because you‚Äôre being insecure, Maureen.‚Äù

But it wasn‚Äôt insecurity. It was betrayal.

And now, here I was‚Äîalone at her birthday party. Watching the three of them giggle and clink glasses like they were the main characters in some twisted romantic comedy. Jared had just taken a shot‚Äîand with a laugh, he pressed the empty glass to Audrey‚Äôs lips, his free hand grazing her body as if they were already lovers.

I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I got up and quietly slipped back into one of the guest rooms upstairs. But just as I was pulling the blanket over my head, the door creaked open.

‚ÄúMaureen?‚Äù Audrey‚Äôs voice was laced with fake concern. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre looking for you downstairs. We‚Äôre about to do the fireworks.‚Äù

I stayed still. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired and sleepy. Just go.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on‚Ä¶‚Äù She stepped closer. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my birthday. Are you really going to be like this?‚Äù

I turned to face her, my voice low. ‚ÄúAudrey, isn‚Äôt it enough that I was forced to be here?‚Äù

She frowned. ‚ÄúDo you really hate me now? Is it because you think I stole them from you? That was never my intention. Please‚Ä¶ we used to be best friends‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúStop.‚Äù I held up my hand. ‚ÄúJust go enjoy your party.‚Äù

But she wouldn‚Äôt. She grabbed my wrist, tugging. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go. It‚Äôll be fun. I‚Äôm happy when you‚Äôre with me‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch me!‚Äù I tried to yank away, but her grip tightened.

In the struggle, we lost balance. We both fell backward‚ÄîAudrey crashing into the small table beside the bed. The vase on top tipped and shattered, the shards slicing into our arms and shoulders.

Pain bloomed down my forearm, but before I could react, the door flew open.

My boyfriend Jared. He didn‚Äôt rush to me. No. He ran to her.

‚ÄúAre you okay? Audrey‚Äîwhat happened?!‚Äù he asked, checking her wounds, brushing the glass from her skin.

‚ÄúShe pushed me,‚Äù Audrey whimpered. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to‚Äîshe just‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the heck, Maureen?!‚Äù Jared turned to me with a snarl. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre ruining everything. Again.‚Äù

I stared at him, speechless. Blood dripping from my hand.

‚ÄúShe attacked me,‚Äù I said, shaking. ‚ÄúShe pulled me. I told her to stop‚Äî‚Äù

But he wasn‚Äôt listening. Neither was Jackson, who had now joined them. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always like this,‚Äù he snapped. ‚ÄúJealous. Dramatic. Can‚Äôt stand not being the center of attention.‚Äù

Then I was told to apologize. Even with blood soaking through my sleeves, I was the one ruining her birthday.

Jackson grabbed me by the arm. ‚ÄúCome on. You‚Äôre coming downstairs. We‚Äôre celebrating. You‚Äôre not going to embarrass the family again.‚Äù

So I went. Bruised, bleeding, humiliated‚ÄîI stood beneath the fireworks, watching them laugh and dance.

Just one last time, I thought. One last time, I‚Äôll try. I joined the circle by the bonfire, fake smile painted on like war paint.

The music swelled. People cheered. I was swaying, barely holding it together when I felt the shove. Jared pushed me? How‚Ä¶ why?

I stumbled straight into the bonfire‚Äôs edge. Pain exploded up my arm as flames kissed my skin.

I screamed.

Someone screamed with me‚ÄîAudrey. She rushed to my side, panicked. ‚ÄúOh, god! Maureen is hurt! We need to call an ambulance‚Äîshe‚Äôs hurt‚Äî‚Äù

But Jared stepped in, shaking his head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing. Just a small burn. She‚Äôll get by. It‚Äôs her punishment for hurting you a while ago.""

And Jackson? He didn‚Äôt even look at me.

No one helped.

I dragged myself away from the fire. Then I hailed a cab.

No one offered to take me to the hospital. No one cared that I was bleeding.

But that was fine‚Ä¶ because this is the last time they‚Äôre going to hurt me again.

Chapter 2

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good thing you came in right away,‚Äù the nurse said as she gently cleaned the raw skin of my arm. ‚ÄúThis is a second-degree burn, and you needed stitches too.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt respond. Just nodded. The white ceiling above me blurred. I stayed at the hospital for two more days.

Not a call. Not a single message. No ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù No ‚ÄúSorry for what happened.‚Äù

Nothing. They didn‚Äôt even care enough to pretend.

On the second evening, I found myself aimlessly scrolling through my phone. Maybe some part of me still hoped they‚Äôd reached out. But all I found were photos.

Bright, glowing snapshots of Audrey in her brand-new red dress, smiling between Jared and Jackson. Champagne glasses raised. That same smirk on her lips that she always wore when she knew she had won.

‚ÄúThank you Jared and Jackson for the best birthday ever! I‚Äôll treasure this forever! Look at our new friendship bracelets!!!‚Äù

I zoomed in. Three matching bracelets. And then Jared and Jackson no longer wore our friendship bracelets like before.

I turned off the screen and placed the phone face down on the side table. Just silence again. My heart pounded in that silence. But it didn‚Äôt hurt anymore. It was just‚Ä¶ empty.

Two days later, I was back at the apartment. The same place we‚Äôd all moved into after college. It was supposed to be a home for a family, only that they had betrayed me.

I stepped inside the quiet living room and headed straight to my bedroom. I opened the closet and began to pack.

I reached for my shoes and then paused. There it was‚Äîthe memory box. That dumb, stupid box I had once called my ""treasure chest.""

I sat on the floor, dragging it out, letting the dust coat my fingers. Inside were letters. Crumpled, faded ones written by Jared and Jackson from when we were kids. Stick drawings, silly poems, ‚Äúget well soon‚Äù cards when I had the flu.

And a photo. The three of us‚Äîme, Jared, and Jackson‚Äîkneeling by a treehouse, dirt on our clothes, wide grins across our faces.

I remembered that day. It was the summer I got bit by a dog. Or almost did. I was always terrified of dogs, and the neighbor‚Äôs dog had gotten loose. I froze, too scared to move. Jared and Jackson had jumped in front of me like it was instinct. Jared even got a bite on his arm just to protect me.

After that, everything changed. They became my shadows. My protectors. And somewhere along the way, I had fallen in love with Jared, while Jackson treated me like a sister.

Until Audrey ruined everything.

I sat on the floor, gripping a friendship bracelet with my name on it. I was such a fool.

My parents had warned me when I begged them to adopt Audrey. ‚ÄúAre you sure about this, Maureen? Not everyone wants a sister the way you do. And what if she hurts you? You can‚Äôt just trust anyone that easy.‚Äù

I hadn‚Äôt listened. I believed love would be enough.

But now?

Now I knew.

She didn‚Äôt want to be my sister. She wanted to be me.

I packed up the rest of my things. Then, I carried the memory box outside. I set the box down and lit the match in the backyard.

The flames caught quickly. The letters curled, blackening. The bracelets twisted in the heat, their gold sheen turning dull and dead. The photos dissolved into ash.

‚ÄúMaureen!‚Äù

I turned at the sound of Jared‚Äôs voice. He came running from inside, panic written all over his face.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing?!‚Äù he shouted. ‚ÄúAre those‚Ä¶ are those our albums?! The bracelets?!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said simply. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm burning all our memories.‚Äù

He tried to move closer, but I stepped in front of the fire, blocking him. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs over. All of it.‚Äù

Jackson arrived seconds later, looking just as stunned.

‚ÄúIs this some kind of tantrum?‚Äù he asked, arms crossed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre upset, we get it. But this is dramatic, even for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a tantrum,‚Äù I said, my voice calm, steady. ‚ÄúThis is the end.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really going to let one bad night ruin years of friendship?‚Äù Jared asked. ‚ÄúMaureen, don‚Äôt do this. We can talk‚Äî‚Äù

I met their gaze before turning to Jared. ‚ÄúI don't want to ever be with the both of you again.""

I turned away and walked back inside the apartment, the smoke still curling behind me.

Chapter 3

I thought they‚Äôd leave me alone after I burned everything. But they didn‚Äôt.

Days passed, and slowly, Jared started acting like nothing had happened. He began sending flowers again. He texted like a sweet boyfriend, asked about my day, and even tried to kiss me once when we crossed paths outside the building. It was as if nothing had ever gone wrong.

Jackson followed suit, playing the big brother again‚Äîbringing coffee, joking about old times. Every time they said, ‚ÄúSorry about what happened, let‚Äôs fix things,‚Äù it sounded more like they were apologizing for a stubbed toe than years of neglect and betrayal.

Then they surprised me with dinner.

‚ÄúOur treat,‚Äù Jared said. ‚ÄúAt our old spot.‚Äù

Part of me wanted to delete the message and never look back. But another part of me‚Äîthe tired, devastated part‚Äîwondered if maybe, just maybe, we could end this all without bitterness. Without hating each other.

So I went. The restaurant hadn‚Äôt changed. Dim lighting, warm wooden booths, soft jazz playing overhead. It smelled like rosemary and nostalgia. I sat down, watching them laugh, trying to recapture something that had long since died. For a few moments, it almost felt okay.

Then Jared‚Äôs phone rang.

He glanced at it and froze. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Audrey.‚Äù

He answered, frowning. ‚ÄúWhat? Slow down‚Ä¶ You were robbed? What? Stabbed?! Where are you‚Äî‚Äù

In seconds, both he and Jackson were on their feet.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs crying,‚Äù Jared explained breathlessly. ‚ÄúShe was attacked. We‚Äôve got to go.‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt say goodbye. They didn‚Äôt even look at me again.

They just ran. Ran like their world depended on her.

I sat there in silence, staring at the half-eaten food. The candle on the table flickered until it burned out completely.

I paid the bill myself.

When I stepped outside, the sky had opened up. Thunder cracked across the heavens as rain poured relentlessly. The streets were nearly empty‚Äîno taxis, no buses. The restaurant manager offered me an umbrella, but they were already closed. I couldn‚Äôt stay.

So I walked. Each step was heavy. My bandaged arms ached. My body screamed for rest. But the worst part?

The thunder. It echoed in my chest, triggering a deep fear I‚Äôd carried since childhood. I always froze during storms. The lightning, the cracks‚Äîit made me feel like the world was about to split in two.

I wrapped my coat tighter and kept going, the city turning into a blur of light and shadows.

Then‚Äîa sharp light. A horn.

A car.

I didn‚Äôt even have time to move.

Then: darkness.

When I woke up, everything felt‚Ä¶ soft. Too soft. I was in a room I didn‚Äôt recognize. Clean, white walls. Dim lighting. My body hurt, but it was dull, distant. I blinked hard, turning toward the sound of someone shifting nearby.

‚ÄúJared‚Ä¶?‚Äù I whispered.

But it wasn‚Äôt him.

A man sat in the corner, tall, dressed in black, his eyes unreadable. He didn‚Äôt move until I tried to sit up.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre awake,‚Äù he said. His voice was deep, steady. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move too much.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho‚Ä¶ are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúRoscoe,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI found you after the accident. Took you to the hospital. You were unconscious.‚Äù

I wanted to ask more. But everything spun‚Äîand I blacked out again.

When I opened my eyes again, Roscoe was gone.

No note. No contact. Just‚Ä¶ gone. There were no missed calls. No messages. No check-ins.

Except for my mother.

Mom: Call me when you‚Äôre on your way here now. Everything‚Äôs ready now. Come home.

I didn‚Äôt tell her what happened. I didn‚Äôt want her to worry.

The nurse told me I‚Äôd been lucky. The car had hit me from the side, but nothing was broken‚Äîstill, I needed a few more days to heal.

So I stayed. Alone.

Until discharge.

Back at the apartment, I stepped inside just to grab the last of my things before I booked my flight home.

That‚Äôs when Jared appeared at the door.

‚ÄúOh, good. You‚Äôre back.‚Äù He smiled like nothing had happened. ‚ÄúSo, listen‚Ä¶ we had to sell your car. And some of your things too. Audrey needed emergency funds, and‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I asked, stunned. ‚ÄúYou sold my things?‚Äù

‚ÄúRelax,‚Äù Jackson said, walking in. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll pay you back. But Audrey‚Äôs been through a lot after the robbery. She needs someone to take care of her‚Äîcan you cook for her? She‚Äôs not eating well.‚Äù

I blinked, stunned. ‚ÄúAre you serious?‚Äù

Jackson‚Äôs brows furrowed. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôve you been anyway? Audrey said you went to some party after the dinner. Don‚Äôt you think that‚Äôs not a good behavior when Audrey was in danger? You shouldn‚Äôt have been here with us! I think you‚Äôre being selfish.‚Äù

I felt like I‚Äôd been punched. I laughed. It came out hollow, broken. ‚ÄúRight. A party.‚Äù

Then I threw the hospital discharge file straight at them.

‚ÄúThere. That‚Äôs where I was. The hospital. You left me in the rain. I walked home through a thunderstorm. I got hit by a car.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶?‚Äù Jared asked, staring. ‚ÄúYou were in the hospital?‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought you were with friends‚Ä¶‚Äù Jackson mumbled, confused. ‚ÄúAudrey said‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course she did,‚Äù I snapped. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always Audrey, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

Before they could say more, a high-pitched scream came from the hallway.

‚ÄúHelp! Jared, Jackson‚Äîit hurts! Please!‚Äù

Audrey. Of course.

Always Audrey.

I didn‚Äôt wait to hear their response. I turned, stepped over the threshold, and walked away.

Chapter 4

My entire body still ached. So instead of leaving as planned, I stayed in my room, letting the dull pain anchor me to the bed.

I didn‚Äôt cry. There were no tears left.

When I opened my eyes again, sunlight streamed through the curtains, warm against my skin. And right there, at the foot of my bed, stood Jared and Jackson.

‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù Jared said with a sheepish smile, holding a tray. ‚ÄúWe brought you breakfast.‚Äù

Jackson placed the tray gently on my lap. Toast, scrambled eggs, some fruit, and a glass of orange juice. Bland and almost cold.

‚ÄúThought you could use something to start the day,‚Äù Jackson added, sitting at the edge of the bed.

I looked at them. They looked casual. Relaxed. Almost happy. Like the last few days hadn‚Äôt happened.

‚ÄúLook,‚Äù Jared said, scratching the back of his neck. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sorry. Audrey told us she saw an Instagram story of you at a party that night‚Ä¶ and she was just hurt, you know? She got robbed and stabbed while thinking you were out dancing. She‚Ä¶ she thought you were ignoring her on purpose.‚Äù

Jackson chimed in. ‚ÄúShe really believed it. So‚Ä¶ maybe you should apologize to her. Just to clear things up.‚Äù

I stared at them in disbelief, then scoffed.

‚ÄúMaybe you should apologize to me.‚Äù

That made them blink.

Jared frowned. ‚ÄúWhy would we? It‚Äôs not like we did anything wrong. You didn‚Äôt tell us what happened. If you had, we could‚Äôve been there for you.‚Äù

I let out a bitter laugh. ‚ÄúDo I need to beg to be cared about now? I was gone for days. You didn‚Äôt even check.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say that,‚Äù Jackson said firmly. ‚ÄúAudrey got stabbed. She needs us.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd I didn‚Äôt?‚Äù My voice sharpened. ‚ÄúSo if I‚Äôm not bleeding in front of you, I don‚Äôt deserve a second thought?‚Äù

Before either of them could respond, the door creaked open and in she came.

Audrey. She wore a soft, oversized sweater and limped slightly. Her face was pale, lips trembling as tears welled up in her eyes.

‚ÄúAre you picking a fight with me now, Maureen?‚Äù she whispered, her voice shaking. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. Okay? I didn‚Äôt mean to get hurt. I didn‚Äôt mean for any of this to happen.‚Äù

I watched her carefully. Her trembling, her pout, the subtle gaslighting laced in every word. Like she was the one being attacked.

Again. The tears slipped down her cheeks.

‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want us to be enemies. We were sisters once‚Ä¶ I wish we could go back.‚Äù

And just like that, the boys snapped.

‚ÄúStop making her cry, Maureen,‚Äù Jared snapped.

‚ÄúCome on, Audrey,‚Äù Jackson said softly. ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be walking too much. Let‚Äôs get you back to bed.‚Äù

They turned to her with such care, such concern‚Äîit stung.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll feed you,‚Äù Jared said as he took her hand. ‚ÄúYou need to eat.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Jackson added. ‚ÄúYou need your strength. We‚Äôll get your favorite seafood in the other room.‚Äù

Then they turned back to me.

‚ÄúYou eat what we made, Maureen,‚Äù Jared said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been discharged. Stop being so picky.‚Äù

And with that, they led Audrey out, leaving me alone again.

I looked down at the plate in front of me. The eggs were rubbery. The toast, dry. The fruit was unripe.

Across the hall, I could hear them laughing.

Audrey‚Äôs voice rang out clear: ‚ÄúMmm, I love crab legs! You remembered I hate toast, right? Seafood‚Äôs my favorite!‚Äù

Of course it was. They gave me scraps and fed her a feast.

I didn‚Äôt cry. Not this time. I was just done.

My phone buzzed.

It was a message from Mom: Venue options are in. Also attached are the dresses. Let me know what you like, darling.

I tapped the call icon.

‚ÄúMom,‚Äù I said, my voice steady.

‚ÄúMaureen! Did you get the pictures? What do you think of the flower arrangements?‚Äù she asked excitedly. ‚ÄúAnd also the dresses?‚Äù

‚ÄúI like everything. It was actually hard to choose,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll finalize it today. But I think I like the vintage one.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat! We‚Äôll prepare it for you. How long until you come back? Your groom‚Äôs waiting, you know. He‚Äôs very eager.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust a few more days. Something happened, but I‚Äôll be there. I‚Äôm looking forward to wearing those dresses‚Ä¶ to the wedding.‚Äù

Mom let out a soft laugh. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my girl. We‚Äôll wait for you.‚Äù

I hung up. I stared at the tray, untouched. Then I felt it‚Äîthe silence shift.

I looked up. Jared and Jackson stood in the doorway. I hadn‚Äôt even heard them come back.

Their eyes locked on me, their faces unreadable.

Jackson‚Äôs voice came first. ‚ÄúDress to the wedding?‚Äù

Then Jared stepped forward, his brows pulling into a frown. ‚ÄúWedding? What wedding?‚Äù",1,1750147219.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

1ldhcbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1ldhcbk/im_not_sure_whats_wrong_with_me/,I'm not sure what's wrong with me,"So for context I've always been tall and skinny so when I gain a pound or two it shows. I grew up and live in a household where everyone has some sort of weird relationship with food; my dad is a health nut and works out everyday and when he does have a treat, like if my mom makes cookies, he eats all of them because he feels like he has to savor the oppurtunity. My mom on the other hand has been overweight my entire life. She eats like shit and I would feel bad about saying that if she made an effort to change and be better but she dosen't. There have also been times in my early childhood where my older sister has called me a pig, fat, and other mean names because yes, I ate a lot. In middle school I was bestfriends with a girl who was skinnier than me. That was really hard for me and I stopped eating for a while. That sounds so fucked up but I've always relished in the fact that I'm always the skinniest person in the room. (She was also shorter than me and more ""full"" so she looked more proportionate). My relationship with my body is also pretty fucked up. I was bullied in middle schoo,l called names like ""slender woman"" and unoriginal shit like that because like I said,  I was tall and thin. I know its contradictory me saying I liked being skinny and then hated being bullied for it but it's hard to explain. I also lost all my friends that year and my mental health depleted. I cut myself in the bathroom almost everyday just trying to see how deep I could go before I bled out right there on the bathroom floor. I started smoking weed and would steal benadrly from target every week, taking about 30-40 tablets a night and a few during the day so I don't remember most of middle school. The first week of my freshman year I tried to commit suicide and was admitted to a mental hospital for a few weeks so that also set me back in more ways than one. The entirety of my sophmore year is a blur, much like eight grade year. I was high almost every day and was really struggling. I was barely passing my classes and slept through most of them but I felt like if my friends or parents knew I would be even more a disappoinment than I already was so I told them I was getting good grades. I started self harming again and I felt like I deserved to be in pain. Guilt washed over me everytime the wounds started healing too quick and I would pick at them until I was bleeding through my clothes. Now to the present, I am 16 and on summer break going into junior year. I never thought I would make it this far. I will now talk about the main reason for the post. I haven't gotten high or drinken at all so far, (not voluntarily), and I'm about 3-4 weeks into summer. The withdrawls are so bad that I started abusing caffeine. I'll have at least 3 cups of coffee in the morning and a few energy drinks throughout the day. On top of this, I only eat until I am about to pass out. Admittedly, I like the reverse effects of caffeine of when you consume too much and deprive your body of nutrients, it makes you shakey and tired. Most of the time I can't remember what day it is or even stand up straight. I don't know why I started depriving myself again but I cant stop. I love the feeling and it makes the days easier by just being able to sleep through them. Another effect is some weird anxiety. I've always had anxiety but with my new habit some new syptoms came along. I feel like there's always someone behind me and I'm always looking behind my shoulder. I also feel like I'm physically falling all the time, like the feeling you get when you're about to drop on a roller coaster. This happens whenever I turn my head or start walking, its like my brain cant keep up with my body. Basically I'm fucking up my body's hormones and it's like I can feel myself deteriorating, mentally and physically. I slowly feel myself drifting back into depression and I honestly don't want to stop. I've never felt lonlier, no one texts me or calls me and I feel like all the friendships I've risked my sanity over are just meaningless. I dont really know why I decided to write this. I've never written or shared this much about my past I just feel like I need to justify my sadness or something. Idk maybe I'm just 16 and all of this is normal but I'm just really sick of it. I think about dying everyday, not exactly planning it but more so hoping it will just happen. This might be morbid but for example, everytime I hear a plane fly over my house I secretly hope it crashes into or bombs my house and kills me, shit like that. I don't know, I just know somethings wrong with me and I rlly dont want to self diagnose but I dont want to put my parents through the pain again of having their daughter struffling. I guess I never stopped struggling I just got better at hiding it and they think I'm fine I guess. I have never shared this much literally not even in therapy I feel disgusting.

So one Sunday morning, I drag myself to the kitchen to make chai ‚Äî obviously in full ‚Äúhome zombie‚Äù mode: one slipper missing, hair in a mess, towel on my shoulder like some retired wrestler.

I light the stove, add milk‚Ä¶ and realise ‚Äî no chai patti.

Now picture this: me, in pyjamas, literally sprinting to the shop downstairs, like it‚Äôs some Olympic final.

On my way back, I‚Äôm climbing the stairs, and I literally trip ‚Äî like trip-trip ‚Äî and the piece of ginger in my hand flies up like it's in DDLJ but low budget.

I fall near the neighbour‚Äôs gate. New guy. Moved in recently. Around my age.

He‚Äôs just standing there. Holding coffee.

Looks at me. Smiles a little. Says nothing. Goes inside.

Since then ‚Äî he‚Äôs never tried to talk, but I catch him looking sometimes. Like from his window when I‚Äôm in the balcony pretending to water plants but actually just spacing out.

But I ignore it. Because why overthink? (Okay fine I do overthink. Daily.)

Maybe I‚Äôm just background comedy in his Netflix life.

Or maybe I am the plot twist and I just don‚Äôt know it yet.

Anyway. I found the ginger. It was fine.

I've been on this subreddit before but not much luck. Unfortunately most messages have about as much substance as the people behind them. I'm looking for long term friends and actual connections but I know that's a bit of a loaded request on here. I'm hoping we have things in common to talk about. A bit about me is I'm quite introverted. I enjoy a lot of quiet, creative hobbies like reading and journaling. I like old sitcoms and cartoons, I'm not huge on anime but I do read a few mangas. A quiet and slower lifestyle. I love visiting libraries, coffee shops, bookstores, thrift stores. It's a bit hard to find others like me because they're usually all hiding the same. I do love spending time with someone while just doing our own things, the company is very nice. I'll match your energy when it comes to messaging, I love to chat but I am shy at first. I'm pretty easy going but I am a bit of an old lady compared to most. I hope you know how to carry a conversation or show interest in it. If you're looking for a short conversation, I probably won't be a fun chat. Something a bit different to my other hobbies is I love paranormal and supernatural topics. I have some pretty odd, spiritual beliefs before we get to the conversation. I enjoy some video games but not huge on it. I love COD zombies, RDR2, Minecraft, The Sims, Infinity Nikki, and some others. I hope your message is a bit more than just a hi, hello. I'm 27 from Cali, open to anyone but keep it sfw. It would be great to make some girl friends, I hope I can find other women looking for genuine friends. It would be great if you're within a 6-8 hr time difference so its not so difficult but if we can make good friends, I'm sure we can make it work!

Here are some icebreakers:

* What do you enjoy watching?
* Do you believe in anything paranormal or supernatural?
* Do you collect anything?
* What's a deal breaker for you in a friendship?
* How do you like spending your time?
* Do you have any pets?",1,1750146174.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

Anyone else trapped in an agency that won‚Äôt evolve?,"I started a new job about 8 months ago ‚Äì full-time, fully in-office. I‚Äôve worked at a few agencies over the years, and in the early days, I loved the buzz and the culture. But now, 10 years into my career, it feels like the world has changed‚Ä¶ and some companies haven‚Äôt caught up.

I genuinely love the people I work with. But the environment itself is a nightmare when it comes to actually getting work done. There‚Äôs loud music playing all day, constant shouting and chatter and a ping pong table that gets a lot of action right outside our open-plan office. There‚Äôs not a single quiet space to focus ‚Äì and for someone like me who thrives in calm, focused environments, it‚Äôs exhausting. I‚Äôve asked if I can go work at a coffee shop just down the road during reporting periods for an hour or so (when I really need to concentrate), but the response from my boss is always passive-aggressive.

Working from home isn‚Äôt an option either. Management is old school and obsessed with the idea that letting one person work remotely will ‚Äúset a precedent‚Äù ‚Äì as if trust is something employees should have to earn just to be treated like adults. Even though I know I‚Äôm more productive in a quieter space, I‚Äôm expected to be at my desk every day from 9 to (sometimes well past) 5 ‚Äì often just so the bosses can have drinks in the office and expect us to stick around too. Even if we‚Äôre driving.

Sick? Too bad. People come into the office with fevers, stomach bugs, and flu ‚Äì it‚Äôs just kind of expected. A few weeks ago, our boss even brought his kids into the office for the entire day‚Ä¶ while they had bronchitis and tonsillitis.

On top of that, we‚Äôre now being asked to help ‚Äúredefine the business.‚Äù Each week, we‚Äôre given unpaid ‚Äúhomework‚Äù ‚Äì come up with a new mission and purpose statement for the agency, build a slide deck, present creative ideas, etc. We‚Äôre expected to do this outside of working hours, with no incentive and no extra pay.

My stepbrother and I had been living in this apartment for two weeks now.

We'd been together for five years, our relationship dancing on the razor's edge between forbidden and intoxicating.

Those first few days after the move? Everything felt peaceful.

Until our downstairs neighbor showed up.

She had this uncanny ability to ""accidentally"" bump into me everywhere‚Äîhallways, stairwells, even the laundry room. Always clutching some random item that had supposedly ""fallen from our place."" Socks, t-shirts, even men's underwear.

At first, I didn't think much of it. Maybe the wind really did blow our laundry off the line.

But that morning changed everything. She stood at my door in an almost see-through nightgown, lips curved in a knowing smile, dangling a pair of black men's briefs from her finger.

I froze. I knew those underwear. Brand new, still had the tags when I'd unwrapped them. I'd watched him put them on just that morning.

Ice water crashed through my veins, chilling me to the bone.

The morning replayed in my mind like a broken record. Callum had been lying next to me at dawn, his arm draped possessively across my waist. He'd kissed my shoulder and murmured that we should sleep in.

So we did. Nearly eight o'clock before we finally dragged ourselves out of bed. He'd rummaged through his luggage and grabbed those black briefs I'd bought him two days earlier.

I remembered it perfectly. He'd even joked, ""You've got good taste.""

Now those same briefs were swaying from Cleo's fingertips.

""Hey, Maeve! Sorry to bother you again!""

""These your brother's underwear?""

I blinked, fists clenching. ""Callum doesn't wear this style.""

Cleo arched an eyebrow, her smile turning predatory. She laughed‚Äîa sound like silk hiding razor blades. ""You're Callum's sister. How would you know what belongs to him?""

She hung the underwear on our door hook.

""Make sure you put them away safe.""

I stood frozen, mind blank as static.

Why does she know Callum's my stepbrother? We never told outsiders.

I watched her sultry retreat and slammed the door shut.

This wasn't the first time. Ever since we'd moved above her, she'd been ""finding"" our dropped belongings on her balcony.

I collapsed onto the couch, nausea churning in my gut. Then I remembered our first day here‚Äîmeeting Cleo in the elevator. Callum had been wearing his Air Force uniform.

Cleo's eyes had lit up. ""So cool!""

After we joined the building group chat, she'd gushed about welcoming us. Hoped Callum would find ""happiness"" in our new home.

I never imagined she meant herself.

And apparently, they'd already gotten very acquainted.

The thought drove through me like a nail, stealing my breath.

I couldn't believe Callum would do this. We might not have official labels, but five years together meant our bodies knew each other like second skin.

How could he be tangled up with another woman behind my back?

My hands shook as I reached for my phone to call him. Before I could dial, new messages popped up.

From Cleo.

""Just letting you know‚Äîwe're together now.""

""Don't be naive. Pack up and get out.""

Then came the photos.

Cleo wearing Callum's crisp Air Force jacket, perched on his lap. Her thighs exposed, laughing with wild abandon, red lips nearly touching his neck.

Their pose screamed intimacy‚Äîand deliberate provocation.

Another shot: a hotel room. She wore a camo-print slip dress while Callum was half-undressed, hand on her back like he was about to unzip her.

Those images hit harder than any words could.

I zoomed in obsessively, forcing myself to examine every detail‚Äîuntil I spotted the scar on Callum's arm.

The timestamp read five months ago.

That night he'd claimed emergency duty. Said he had to rush back to base overnight.

My phone slipped from numb fingers, hitting the hardwood with a dull thud.

Had they been together that long?

A notification popped up: dinner reservation confirmed.

Tonight was supposed to be Callum's surprise. I touched my still-flat stomach‚Äîsix weeks pregnant.

Callum was my stepbrother in name, my childhood ""family,"" and my most intimate secret for five years running.

We'd moved here because he'd said, ""Let's start fresh somewhere new.""

Turns out he meant starting fresh with Cleo.

I stood motionless for thirty minutes until my phone buzzed with a dining reminder.

I took a shaky breath, went to our bedroom, changed clothes, and fixed my disheveled hair.

Then I went downstairs and called a cab.

In the taxi, I canceled the restaurant reservation and redirected to the hospital.

I stood at the registration desk for a long time before telling the nurse: ""I need to schedule a pregnancy termination.""

The doctor repeated the same questions: ""Are you certain? The fetus is still very small. There will be other opportunities in the future...""

I just shook my head silently.

""Alright then. Please provide your husband's contact information.""

I quietly gave them Callum's name and number, then paused and added:

""Please contact him only after my procedure is complete.""

""He's Air Force. Very busy. I don't want to interfere with his missions.""

The doctor's expression shifted‚Äînot questioning, but filled with gentle sympathy.

After finishing all the paperwork, I headed home like nothing had happened. Even made a detour to a convenience store in another neighborhood to buy the milk I'd been craving that morning.

Chapter 2

At 8 PM, Callum returned home.

He wore his crisp Air Force uniform, carrying a bouquet of champagne roses.

""Darling, I came home early today and picked up flowers for you.""

Since we'd moved here, Callum always talked about giving me a ""new life"" and ""new rhythm."" He'd started bringing me flowers regularly.

He seemed so devoted, but it was all a tender facade.

I silently accepted the flowers, placing them in the clear glass vase on the dining table.

Behind me, Callum unbuttoned his uniform, preparing for a shower.

He removed his clothes piece by piece, but those black boxer briefs were nowhere to be seen.

I didn't ask, keeping my head down as I browsed the post-operative care instructions the hospital had sent to my phone.

When Callum emerged wrapped in a bathrobe, he encircled my waist from behind.

""Why so quiet today? What are you looking at?""

I locked my phone screen and turned around, forcing a smile.

""Nothing... just checking some precautions for stomach problems. I felt nauseous today.""

Callum frowned, lowering his head to kiss my shoulder.

""You've been like this lately. Is it a dietary issue? Should I take leave and go to the hospital with you?""

I shook my head. ""No need. I'll handle it myself.""

Only then did he relax, kissing my forehead. ""You always push yourself too hard. When this mission cycle ends, I'll take you on vacation.""

I smiled without responding.

A few minutes later, Callum seemed to sense something.

""Maeve, are you hiding something from me?""

I said calmly, ""The downstairs neighbor mentioned again today that she found something of ours that fell from the balcony.""

His expression froze, the muscle at the corner of his eye twitching unnaturally before he looked away, picking up the remote from the table.

""Oh, her again.""

I watched him coolly. ""Do you know what she found this time?""

He didn't answer immediately, fidgeting with the remote's battery compartment, feigning nonchalance. ""What was it?""

I smiled, pointing to the gray sock in the corner.

""What else do you think it could be?""

I clearly saw him exhale in relief.

He went into the bedroom, changing into casual clothes‚Äîa gray T-shirt and athletic shorts.

My gaze fell on the red marks scattered across his shoulders‚Äîmarks that could only be bite marks from intimate encounters.

But since learning about my pregnancy, I hadn't been intimate with Callum at all.

I sat in silence, watching him casually pour water in the kitchen, then his phone rang.

He spoke quickly, keeping his voice low.

""...Tonight? Now? ...Okay, I'll leave immediately.""

The call was brief, lasting only seconds.

After hanging up, he turned to me with a tone both gentle and urgent: ""Base called for an emergency assembly. Night training got moved up.""

He approached, placing his hand on my shoulder, about to kiss me.

This time, I turned my head away.

""Baby, what's wrong?""

Callum looked puzzled.

I didn't explain, answering irritably, ""I don't feel well today. Don't get too close.""

He paused, immediately showing concern. ""Sorry, I forgot about your stomach.""

Callum quickly kissed my forehead.

""Get to bed early tonight. I won't be coming home.""

""Remember to lock all doors and windows.""

With that, he returned to the bedroom to put on his tactical jacket.

I said nothing. Before leaving, I even thoughtfully handed him the car keys.

""Drive safely.""

He hesitated, taking the keys. ""You're always so thoughtful. How could I not love you?""

After saying this, he hurried away.

About ten minutes later, my phone lit up.

It was Cleo calling‚Äîa video call.

In the video, Cleo wore a revealing black halter dress.

""Maeve, welcome to watch the live show between me and your stepbrother,"" she said with a mocking smile.

I must be the first woman to watch her lover's affair broadcast live.

I pressed the screen recording button on my other phone, setting up the device properly.

This would become part of my breakup package when I left Callum.

On screen, I saw Callum in his tactical jacket appear in the video.

""I told you not to contact me at night. What exactly do you want?""

His tone was ice-cold. Cleo moved closer, rubbing against his chest like a cat. ""I just missed you, wanted to be close to you.""

Callum reached out, gripping Cleo's neck, his eyes showing a hint of annoyance.

But I knew him too well‚Äîhe wasn't refusing. This was just sexual foreplay.

""Callum, I really... can't control myself.""

Cleo lowered her head, using her tongue to lick his fingers, wet sounds filling the air.

Her lewd behavior pleased Callum.

""I know, but my bottom line is Maeve. Don't appear in front of her again.""

Callum said firmly.

The next second, he was already wrapping his arm around Cleo's waist, pulling her into his embrace.

Cleo nodded submissively, her long legs wrapping around his waist.

""I understand.""

""Are you going back tonight?"" She clung tightly to Callum's neck.

Callum's expression softened, suddenly reversing the situation by pressing Cleo beneath him.

Their entangled movements on the sofa grew increasingly intense.

The screams and moans became increasingly unbearable.

I calmly closed the video and ended the screen recording.

I slowly stood up, returning to the bedroom as memories of my past with Callum flooded my mind.

Chapter 3

One moment, he pulled me into the equipment room behind the middle school gymnasium, telling me that even though I was his stepsister, he loved me‚ÄîI was his true love, the girl he'd chosen.

I remember him tearing a sticker from the door of the equipment room, writing our names on it with a marker, and hiding it behind the volleyball box. He said this was our secret corner, one that would never be discovered.

The next moment, I watched on my phone screen as he and Cleo were tightly entangled together, their intimate physical connection forcing me to silently withdraw and give them their happy ending.

At dawn, my phone's ringtone pulled me from light sleep back to reality.

""Hello, Ms. Maeve. Tomorrow morning's surgery has been scheduled.""

""Pre-operative examination instructions have been sent to your phone. Please review them and prepare accordingly.""

I mumbled a response, and just as I hung up, the bedroom door opened.

""What surgery?"" Callum entered carrying a breakfast bag, his brow slightly furrowed.

""Baby, who were you just talking to?""

I instinctively locked my screen, pressing the phone under my pillow.

""It was my friend. She needs minor surgery and wants me to accompany her.""

He placed a coffee cup on the nightstand and handed me a fresh bagel from the corner bakery.

""Which friend? I haven't heard you mention this before.""

""Which hospital?""

""Do you need my help?""

He fired off questions one after another.

I shook my head, casually naming a medical center.

""It's just minor surgery. The doctor said it's not serious‚Äîno need to trouble you.""

Only then did Callum nod, shifting the conversation to tonight's plans.

""Darling, tonight is our five-year anniversary.""

""I made reservations at that Italian restaurant you've always wanted to try. I'll pick you up tonight.""

After speaking, Callum got up and put on his Air Force uniform.

He fastened his belt, then turned to glance at me.

In that moment, I saw it on the back of his neck‚Äîa deep red mark that didn't belong to me.

Whoever left it had a clear purpose: to be seen.

She had succeeded.

Tears fell silently, quickly spreading into a small dark stain on the light gray sheets.

I suddenly remembered the second winter of our secret relationship.

After celebrating my birthday with me, he held me in my room and asked, ""Could you leave a mark on my neck? Something visible?""

""I want everyone to know I belong to someone.""

I smiled shyly and left a bright red mark on his neck.

He admired it in the mirror for a long time.

But now, the hickey on his body was a deliberate memorial left by another woman.

It didn't matter anymore. Tomorrow, after the surgery, everything would be over.

...

That evening, Callum appeared punctually downstairs from our apartment building.

As soon as I got in the car, I smelled a familiar perfume.

Like coconut mixed with vanilla‚Äîthe scent I'd noticed on Cleo before.

Though faint, I wouldn't mistake it.

I didn't speak, just frowned slightly. Callum noticed immediately, glancing at me peripherally before quickly explaining:

""Baby, don't misunderstand. A colleague at base asked me to pick up this perfume for his girlfriend.""

""He's on duty rotation and couldn't get to the store himself. I was passing by anyway."" As Callum spoke, he reached into the backseat, retrieving the perfume bottle and waving it in front of me.

Then he pulled out his phone, showing me message records with this ""colleague,"" trying to appear transparent.

Seeing I didn't press further, Callum relaxed and started the car.

The restaurant was located in a riverside district in downtown New York, where diners could gaze at the Hudson River's nighttime scenery through floor-to-ceiling windows.

Callum and I had been to this restaurant many times before, but tonight felt different.

I saw her‚ÄîCleo.

She wore a dark green dress, her blonde hair pinned up, makeup perfect, sitting at a window table across from ours. An untouched glass of red wine sat beside her, as if she'd just been seated.

She looked toward us, her gaze casually sweeping over Callum before turning to the window as if we were strangers.

But I noticed Callum's expression change.

He sat beside me, his ring-wearing hand unconsciously tapping the table.

I could feel his attention wasn't on me at all‚Äîbecause of the woman across from us.

I looked away, lifting my orange juice for a sip.

Just then, his phone on the table vibrated softly.

""Darling, there's an emergency situation at base. I need to take this call. Look at the menu first, okay?""

Callum spoke lightly, but his eyes drifted toward Cleo's direction.",1,1750145534.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Initially for a year it was muscleblaze biozyme whey.. after I changed the gym I changed my whey to Avvatar since prices were same (that time) and they were offering 28 grams of protein per scoop (every gram matters for a vegetarian).
After getting bored with malai kulfi flavor, during May's sale I ordered Avvatar's 100% performance whey, cold coffee flavor for the first time (They rebranded 100% performace whey in 2025, giving 25 grams per scoop, until last year they were giving 22 grams per scoop, 35 gms scoop size in both). 


So I received the product on 3rd June, and thankfully I checked the Mfg date before opening the seal and I was shocked to see that they sent me an old batch Mfg product from 9/12/24 offering only 22 grams protein ( which was in circulation before the rebranded one)..so I technically paid the price for the latest product but got an old product which used to be sold for much lesser price last year.
Always thought of Avvatar as one of the best brands but now that there is something wrong with my parcel and I tried reaching them, i realised how pathetic and shitty their customer services are. 
They don't pick up the calls on their toll free number(for 2-3 minutes the IVR says our customer executives are busy kindly wait..after which it says ""we've noted your number and our executives will call you back, thank you"", but nobody calls you back), they don't reply on WhatsApp. On the emails they reply 3-4 days later when they say that we'll get back to you in 24-48 hours on a priority basis. I've been trying to reach a resolution since 3rd June and it's already 17th and I can't even open the whey since I have to keep it seal packed to return. I'm without whey for so many days. Never expected this from Avvatar..feeling helpless. Won't go back to them no matter what. 
I even tweeted but got no response there also...

Chapter 1  
  
My stepbrother and I had been living in this apartment for two weeks now.  
  
We'd been together for five years, our relationship dancing on the razor's edge between forbidden and intoxicating.  
  
Those first few days after the move? Everything felt peaceful.  
  
Until our downstairs neighbor showed up.  
  
She had this uncanny ability to ""accidentally"" bump into me everywhere‚Äîhallways, stairwells, even the laundry room. Always clutching some random item that had supposedly ""fallen from our place."" Socks, t-shirts, even men's underwear.  
  
At first, I didn't think much of it. Maybe the wind really did blow our laundry off the line.  
  
But that morning changed everything. She stood at my door in an almost see-through nightgown, lips curved in a knowing smile, dangling a pair of black men's briefs from her finger.  
  
I froze. I knew those underwear. Brand new, still had the tags when I'd unwrapped them. I'd watched him put them on just that morning.  
  
Ice water crashed through my veins, chilling me to the bone.  
  
The morning replayed in my mind like a broken record. Callum had been lying next to me at dawn, his arm draped possessively across my waist. He'd kissed my shoulder and murmured that we should sleep in.  
  
So we did. Nearly eight o'clock before we finally dragged ourselves out of bed. He'd rummaged through his luggage and grabbed those black briefs I'd bought him two days earlier.  
  
I remembered it perfectly. He'd even joked, ""You've got good taste.""  
  
Now those same briefs were swaying from Cleo's fingertips.  
  
""Hey, Maeve! Sorry to bother you again!""  
  
""These your brother's underwear?""  
  
I blinked, fists clenching. ""Callum doesn't wear this style.""  
  
Cleo arched an eyebrow, her smile turning predatory. She laughed‚Äîa sound like silk hiding razor blades. ""You're Callum's sister. How would you know what belongs to him?""  
  
She hung the underwear on our door hook.  
  
""Make sure you put them away safe.""  
  
I stood frozen, mind blank as static.  
  
Why does she know Callum's my stepbrother? We never told outsiders.  
  
I watched her sultry retreat and slammed the door shut.  
  
This wasn't the first time. Ever since we'd moved above her, she'd been ""finding"" our dropped belongings on her balcony.  
  
I collapsed onto the couch, nausea churning in my gut. Then I remembered our first day here‚Äîmeeting Cleo in the elevator. Callum had been wearing his Air Force uniform.  
  
Cleo's eyes had lit up. ""So cool!""  
  
After we joined the building group chat, she'd gushed about welcoming us. Hoped Callum would find ""happiness"" in our new home.  
  
I never imagined she meant herself.  
  
And apparently, they'd already gotten very acquainted.  
  
The thought drove through me like a nail, stealing my breath.  
  
I couldn't believe Callum would do this. We might not have official labels, but five years together meant our bodies knew each other like second skin.  
  
How could he be tangled up with another woman behind my back?  
  
My hands shook as I reached for my phone to call him. Before I could dial, new messages popped up.  
  
From Cleo.  
  
""Just letting you know‚Äîwe're together now.""  
  
""Don't be naive. Pack up and get out.""  
  
Then came the photos.  
  
Cleo wearing Callum's crisp Air Force jacket, perched on his lap. Her thighs exposed, laughing with wild abandon, red lips nearly touching his neck.  
  
Their pose screamed intimacy‚Äîand deliberate provocation.  
  
Another shot: a hotel room. She wore a camo-print slip dress while Callum was half-undressed, hand on her back like he was about to unzip her.  
  
Those images hit harder than any words could.  
  
I zoomed in obsessively, forcing myself to examine every detail‚Äîuntil I spotted the scar on Callum's arm.  
  
The timestamp read five months ago.  
  
That night he'd claimed emergency duty. Said he had to rush back to base overnight.  
  
My phone slipped from numb fingers, hitting the hardwood with a dull thud.  
  
Had they been together that long?  
  
A notification popped up: dinner reservation confirmed.  
  
Tonight was supposed to be Callum's surprise. I touched my still-flat stomach‚Äîsix weeks pregnant.  
  
Callum was my stepbrother in name, my childhood ""family,"" and my most intimate secret for five years running.  
  
We'd moved here because he'd said, ""Let's start fresh somewhere new.""  
  
Turns out he meant starting fresh with Cleo.  
  
I stood motionless for thirty minutes until my phone buzzed with a dining reminder.  
  
I took a shaky breath, went to our bedroom, changed clothes, and fixed my disheveled hair.  
  
Then I went downstairs and called a cab.  
  
In the taxi, I canceled the restaurant reservation and redirected to the hospital.  
  
I stood at the registration desk for a long time before telling the nurse: ""I need to schedule a pregnancy termination.""  
  
The doctor repeated the same questions: ""Are you certain? The fetus is still very small. There will be other opportunities in the future...""  
  
I just shook my head silently.  
  
""Alright then. Please provide your husband's contact information.""  
  
I quietly gave them Callum's name and number, then paused and added:  
  
""Please contact him only after my procedure is complete.""  
  
""He's Air Force. Very busy. I don't want to interfere with his missions.""  
  
The doctor's expression shifted‚Äînot questioning, but filled with gentle sympathy.  
  
After finishing all the paperwork, I headed home like nothing had happened. Even made a detour to a convenience store in another neighborhood to buy the milk I'd been craving that morning.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
At 8 PM, Callum returned home.  
  
He wore his crisp Air Force uniform, carrying a bouquet of champagne roses.  
  
""Darling, I came home early today and picked up flowers for you.""  
  
Since we'd moved here, Callum always talked about giving me a ""new life"" and ""new rhythm."" He'd started bringing me flowers regularly.  
  
He seemed so devoted, but it was all a tender facade.  
  
I silently accepted the flowers, placing them in the clear glass vase on the dining table.  
  
Behind me, Callum unbuttoned his uniform, preparing for a shower.  
  
He removed his clothes piece by piece, but those black boxer briefs were nowhere to be seen.  
  
I didn't ask, keeping my head down as I browsed the post-operative care instructions the hospital had sent to my phone.  
  
When Callum emerged wrapped in a bathrobe, he encircled my waist from behind.  
  
""Why so quiet today? What are you looking at?""  
  
I locked my phone screen and turned around, forcing a smile.  
  
""Nothing... just checking some precautions for stomach problems. I felt nauseous today.""  
  
Callum frowned, lowering his head to kiss my shoulder.  
  
""You've been like this lately. Is it a dietary issue? Should I take leave and go to the hospital with you?""  
  
I shook my head. ""No need. I'll handle it myself.""  
  
Only then did he relax, kissing my forehead. ""You always push yourself too hard. When this mission cycle ends, I'll take you on vacation.""  
  
I smiled without responding.  
  
A few minutes later, Callum seemed to sense something.  
  
""Maeve, are you hiding something from me?""  
  
I said calmly, ""The downstairs neighbor mentioned again today that she found something of ours that fell from the balcony.""  
  
His expression froze, the muscle at the corner of his eye twitching unnaturally before he looked away, picking up the remote from the table.  
  
""Oh, her again.""  
  
I watched him coolly. ""Do you know what she found this time?""  
  
He didn't answer immediately, fidgeting with the remote's battery compartment, feigning nonchalance. ""What was it?""  
  
I smiled, pointing to the gray sock in the corner.  
  
""What else do you think it could be?""  
  
I clearly saw him exhale in relief.  
  
He went into the bedroom, changing into casual clothes‚Äîa gray T-shirt and athletic shorts.  
  
My gaze fell on the red marks scattered across his shoulders‚Äîmarks that could only be bite marks from intimate encounters.  
  
But since learning about my pregnancy, I hadn't been intimate with Callum at all.  
  
I sat in silence, watching him casually pour water in the kitchen, then his phone rang.  
  
He spoke quickly, keeping his voice low.  
  
""...Tonight? Now? ...Okay, I'll leave immediately.""  
  
The call was brief, lasting only seconds.  
  
After hanging up, he turned to me with a tone both gentle and urgent: ""Base called for an emergency assembly. Night training got moved up.""  
  
He approached, placing his hand on my shoulder, about to kiss me.  
  
This time, I turned my head away.  
  
""Baby, what's wrong?""  
  
Callum looked puzzled.  
  
I didn't explain, answering irritably, ""I don't feel well today. Don't get too close.""  
  
He paused, immediately showing concern. ""Sorry, I forgot about your stomach.""  
  
Callum quickly kissed my forehead.  
  
""Get to bed early tonight. I won't be coming home.""  
  
""Remember to lock all doors and windows.""  
  
With that, he returned to the bedroom to put on his tactical jacket.  
  
I said nothing. Before leaving, I even thoughtfully handed him the car keys.  
  
""Drive safely.""  
  
He hesitated, taking the keys. ""You're always so thoughtful. How could I not love you?""  
  
After saying this, he hurried away.  
  
About ten minutes later, my phone lit up.  
  
It was Cleo calling‚Äîa video call.  
  
In the video, Cleo wore a revealing black halter dress.  
  
""Maeve, welcome to watch the live show between me and your stepbrother,"" she said with a mocking smile.  
  
I must be the first woman to watch her lover's affair broadcast live.  
  
I pressed the screen recording button on my other phone, setting up the device properly.  
  
This would become part of my breakup package when I left Callum.  
  
On screen, I saw Callum in his tactical jacket appear in the video.  
  
""I told you not to contact me at night. What exactly do you want?""  
  
His tone was ice-cold. Cleo moved closer, rubbing against his chest like a cat. ""I just missed you, wanted to be close to you.""  
  
Callum reached out, gripping Cleo's neck, his eyes showing a hint of annoyance.  
  
But I knew him too well‚Äîhe wasn't refusing. This was just sexual foreplay.  
  
""Callum, I really... can't control myself.""  
  
Cleo lowered her head, using her tongue to lick his fingers, wet sounds filling the air.  
  
Her lewd behavior pleased Callum.  
  
""I know, but my bottom line is Maeve. Don't appear in front of her again.""  
  
Callum said firmly.  
  
The next second, he was already wrapping his arm around Cleo's waist, pulling her into his embrace.  
  
Cleo nodded submissively, her long legs wrapping around his waist.  
  
""I understand.""  
  
""Are you going back tonight?"" She clung tightly to Callum's neck.  
  
Callum's expression softened, suddenly reversing the situation by pressing Cleo beneath him.  
  
Their entangled movements on the sofa grew increasingly intense.  
  
The screams and moans became increasingly unbearable.  
  
I calmly closed the video and ended the screen recording.  
  
I slowly stood up, returning to the bedroom as memories of my past with Callum flooded my mind.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
One moment, he pulled me into the equipment room behind the middle school gymnasium, telling me that even though I was his stepsister, he loved me‚ÄîI was his true love, the girl he'd chosen.  
  
I remember him tearing a sticker from the door of the equipment room, writing our names on it with a marker, and hiding it behind the volleyball box. He said this was our secret corner, one that would never be discovered.  
  
The next moment, I watched on my phone screen as he and Cleo were tightly entangled together, their intimate physical connection forcing me to silently withdraw and give them their happy ending.  
  
At dawn, my phone's ringtone pulled me from light sleep back to reality.  
  
""Hello, Ms. Maeve. Tomorrow morning's surgery has been scheduled.""  
  
""Pre-operative examination instructions have been sent to your phone. Please review them and prepare accordingly.""  
  
I mumbled a response, and just as I hung up, the bedroom door opened.  
  
""What surgery?"" Callum entered carrying a breakfast bag, his brow slightly furrowed.  
  
""Baby, who were you just talking to?""  
  
I instinctively locked my screen, pressing the phone under my pillow.  
  
""It was my friend. She needs minor surgery and wants me to accompany her.""  
  
He placed a coffee cup on the nightstand and handed me a fresh bagel from the corner bakery.  
  
""Which friend? I haven't heard you mention this before.""  
  
""Which hospital?""  
  
""Do you need my help?""  
  
He fired off questions one after another.  
  
I shook my head, casually naming a medical center.  
  
""It's just minor surgery. The doctor said it's not serious‚Äîno need to trouble you.""  
  
Only then did Callum nod, shifting the conversation to tonight's plans.  
  
""Darling, tonight is our five-year anniversary.""  
  
""I made reservations at that Italian restaurant you've always wanted to try. I'll pick you up tonight.""  
  
After speaking, Callum got up and put on his Air Force uniform.  
  
He fastened his belt, then turned to glance at me.  
  
In that moment, I saw it on the back of his neck‚Äîa deep red mark that didn't belong to me.  
  
Whoever left it had a clear purpose: to be seen.  
  
She had succeeded.  
  
Tears fell silently, quickly spreading into a small dark stain on the light gray sheets.  
  
I suddenly remembered the second winter of our secret relationship.  
  
After celebrating my birthday with me, he held me in my room and asked, ""Could you leave a mark on my neck? Something visible?""  
  
""I want everyone to know I belong to someone.""  
  
I smiled shyly and left a bright red mark on his neck.  
  
He admired it in the mirror for a long time.  
  
But now, the hickey on his body was a deliberate memorial left by another woman.  
  
It didn't matter anymore. Tomorrow, after the surgery, everything would be over.  
  
...  
  
That evening, Callum appeared punctually downstairs from our apartment building.  
  
As soon as I got in the car, I smelled a familiar perfume.  
  
Like coconut mixed with vanilla‚Äîthe scent I'd noticed on Cleo before.  
  
Though faint, I wouldn't mistake it.  
  
I didn't speak, just frowned slightly. Callum noticed immediately, glancing at me peripherally before quickly explaining:  
  
""Baby, don't misunderstand. A colleague at base asked me to pick up this perfume for his girlfriend.""  
  
""He's on duty rotation and couldn't get to the store himself. I was passing by anyway."" As Callum spoke, he reached into the backseat, retrieving the perfume bottle and waving it in front of me.  
  
Then he pulled out his phone, showing me message records with this ""colleague,"" trying to appear transparent.  
  
Seeing I didn't press further, Callum relaxed and started the car.  
  
The restaurant was located in a riverside district in downtown New York, where diners could gaze at the Hudson River's nighttime scenery through floor-to-ceiling windows.  
  
Callum and I had been to this restaurant many times before, but tonight felt different.  
  
I saw her‚ÄîCleo.  
  
She wore a dark green dress, her blonde hair pinned up, makeup perfect, sitting at a window table across from ours. An untouched glass of red wine sat beside her, as if she'd just been seated.  
  
She looked toward us, her gaze casually sweeping over Callum before turning to the window as if we were strangers.  
  
But I noticed Callum's expression change.  
  
He sat beside me, his ring-wearing hand unconsciously tapping the table.  
  
I could feel his attention wasn't on me at all‚Äîbecause of the woman across from us.  
  
I looked away, lifting my orange juice for a sip.  
  
Just then, his phone on the table vibrated softly.  
  
""Darling, there's an emergency situation at base. I need to take this call. Look at the menu first, okay?""

Chapter 1  
  
In their third year of marriage, Emma's wedding certificate was accidentally ruined by spilled coffee.  
  
When she went to the county clerk's office to replace it, the clerk typed a few keystrokes and looked up with a puzzled expression. ""Ma'am, your marital status shows as single.""  
  
She froze, certain she'd misheard. ""That's impossible. My husband and I got our license right here three years ago.""  
  
The clerk checked again, her expression growing increasingly awkward. ""The system confirms you're single, but Mr. Chase is listed as married..."" She hesitated. ""His spouse is registered as another woman‚ÄîStella Reed. Do you know her?""  
  
Emma's mind exploded with white noise, her ears ringing sharply.  
  
Everyone knew Emma and Dominic Chase had grown up together. She was his first love, the one he'd protected fiercely since childhood.  
  
And Stella Reed?  
  
She was the replacement Dominic had found during the two years Emma studied abroad‚Äîsomeone to fill the void when he missed her too much.  
  
\---  
  
Emma clutched the coffee-stained fake marriage certificate as she numbly got into her car.  
  
Her phone vibrated twice, and Dominic's message appeared on the screen.  
  
\[Baby, I ditched a billion-dollar deal, bought your favorite roses and that strawberry cake you love, just so I could come home early to be with you. I miss you so much. Do you miss me?\]  
  
She stared at the message and let out a hollow laugh that quickly dissolved into tears streaming down her cheeks.  
  
For three years, he'd asked her that same question daily, expressing his supposed devotion.  
  
But all along... he'd been legally married to someone else behind her back.  
  
She remembered when they were children, how Dominic had fallen from a ten-foot tree trying to retrieve her kite, breaking his arm but still smiling as he handed her the kite, saying, ""Don't cry, Em. It doesn't hurt.""  
  
She remembered her fifteenth birthday, when he stood in the rain outside her house all night just to be the first to wish her happy birthday when she woke up.  
  
She remembered her eighteenth birthday celebration, when he rented an entire amusement park and knelt beneath exploding fireworks, saying, ""Emma, when I turn twenty-two, will you marry me?""  
  
She remembered when she left to study abroad, how he'd pressed her against the airport wall, his voice trembling: ""Two years. I'm only giving you two years, and then I'm coming to bring you back.""  
  
During those two years overseas, he video-called almost daily.  
  
Once when she was too busy with essays to answer for three days, she discovered he'd been hospitalized for alcohol poisoning.  
  
Through the screen, his bloodshot eyes pleaded: ""Baby, I can't live without you.""  
  
She always reassured him: ""I'll be home soon. Just wait a little longer.""  
  
The day she returned, she didn't tell Dominic, wanting to surprise him.  
  
Instead, when she pushed open the door to his private club room, she found him passionately kissing a girl whose profile looked strikingly similar to her own.  
  
Her bag dropped with a thud, and she fled.  
  
Dominic chased after her like a madman. When she wouldn't answer his calls, he bombarded her with messages. When she refused to see him, he stood in the rain outside her apartment, explaining over and over.  
  
""It's not what you think!""  
  
""I missed you so much these years when you wouldn't let me visit, so I found someone who reminded me of you...""  
  
""I swear, we just hugged and kissed, nothing more!""  
  
""Emma, I was wrong, but I truly love you to the point of insanity...""  
  
Finally, after he stood in the rain for three days and nights, collapsing with pneumonia and still refusing to leave the hospital, her heart softened, and she forgave him.  
  
Afterward, he treated her just as wonderfully as before.  
  
Until after they married, when she discovered his assistant had been replaced by Stella Reed. That ""replacement"" he claimed to have sent away.  
  
He explained again: ""Her parents are sick, and they struggled adjusting to the city life. She begged to come back to North Bay...""  
  
""She applied for my assistant position without my knowledge.""  
  
""She's exceptionally qualified and passed all the selection rounds. I can't just fire her without cause.""  
  
So Emma tolerated it again.  
  
Never imagining that her tolerance would turn her into the butt of a cosmic joke.  
  
As her car pulled into their gated community, Emma's tears had dried.  
  
She took a deep breath, about to push open the front door when she overheard Dominic talking with his friend in the living room:  
  
""I just came from the hospital. Stella's fine, just some minor scrapes. You should stay home with Emma, don't worry.""  
  
Dominic lounged on the sofa, his black shirt unbuttoned at the collar, long legs crossed. He frowned and extinguished his friend's cigarette, his voice low and cold: ""How many times have I told you not to smoke in my house? Emma hates the smell.""  
  
""Fine, fine, you obsessive husband,"" his friend teased. ""But I really don't understand‚Äîif you love Emma so much, why did you insist on marrying Stella? Honestly, is she more than just a replacement to you?""  
  
The air stilled for several seconds.  
  
Then Dominic's deep voice broke the silence:  
  
""What if she is?""  
  
""I used to think she was just a stand-in until Emma returned. Then I wouldn't need her anymore.""  
  
""But after sending her away, I dreamed about her almost every night.""  
  
""Eventually I couldn't stand her not being near me, so I brought her back as my assistant.""  
  
""I can't live without Emma, but Stella... I can't let her go either.""  
  
""Emma gets my public devotion, while Stella stays in the shadows with a marriage certificate as compensation. What's wrong with that?""  
  
His friend sighed. ""Aren't you afraid Emma will find out? With her personality, if she ever discovers this, you could die at her feet and she'd never look back.""  
  
Dominic fell silent, his Adam's apple bobbing as he swallowed hard. ""Then she'll never find out.""  
  
Emma stood frozen outside the door, feeling her blood turn to ice. She'd expected to break down sobbing, but found she couldn't even squeeze out a tear.  
  
So this was what absolute pain felt like‚Äîlike having your heart carved out while it still beat.  
  
She thought about how Dominic had tenderly kissed her forehead that morning before leaving; how he'd hold her when drunk and murmur, ""Baby, I can't live without you""; how he'd warm her cold hands against his chest, saying his heart beat only for her‚Ä¶  
  
But it was all a lie.  
  
On her way home, she'd even wondered if he had some desperate explanation.  
  
Now she knew‚Äîhe hadn't chosen between two women. He'd wanted both: one as his public beloved, one as his legal wife.  
  
Fine!  
  
If Dominic feared her finding out, she'd show him what ""never looking back"" truly meant.  
  
She turned and left, immediately doing two things...  
  
Chapter 2  
  
First, she applied to cancel all her identity information in the country.  
  
Second, she changed her name.  
  
The clerk informed her all paperwork would be processed within two weeks.  
  
After two weeks, even if Dominic searched heaven and earth, he'd never find her.  
  
Emma turned and left, her phone buzzing frantically in her bag‚Äîall missed calls and messages from Dominic.  
  
She didn't look or respond.  
  
By the time she returned home, night had fallen.  
  
Dominic stood in the living room, rushing toward her the moment she entered, his eyes filled with obvious anxiety: ""Baby, where have you been? I came home and couldn't find you. I've been waiting for hours, nearly turned the whole city upside down looking for you.""  
  
His concern seemed genuine.  
  
Emma stared at him, her heart seized by an invisible hand.  
  
She suddenly remembered high school, when he'd abandoned a math competition mid-exam to rush back when she was an hour late responding to his message, terrified something had happened to her.  
  
A man who clearly loved her so much, someone she once believed saw her as the most important person in his world. Yet looking at everything now, the love he gave was never truly exclusive.  
  
Her throat felt blocked, making every breath painful, but ultimately, she replied calmly, ""I went shopping and forgot to tell you. Sorry.""  
  
Only then did Dominic finally relaxed, pulling her into his arms: ""Don't apologize. I wasn't angry, just worried.""  
  
As he spoke, he kissed the top of her head, his tone gentle: ""Alright baby, you mentioned the other day you were craving those sweet and tangy BBQ ribs and that herb-crusted sea bass. I'll make them for you right now, okay?""  
  
With that, he released her and headed to the kitchen.  
  
Emma stood at the doorway, silently watching Dominic. He rolled up his shirt sleeves, his long fingers skillfully chopping vegetables, his profile looking especially gentle in the warm light.  
  
She suddenly remembered how, three years ago when she first returned, her chronic stomach problems from irregular eating had hospitalized her.  
  
Back then, Dominic‚Äîa billionaire CEO who'd never cooked‚Äîspent a month learning from top chefs to prepare proper meals for her.  
  
Once, when an international video conference clashed with his cooking time, he propped his tablet in the kitchen, listening to reports while stir-frying, shocking his executives.  
  
He once loved her so intensely, as if his entire universe revolved around her.  
  
But right now? The second his phone buzzed, his expression subtly shifted, and he immediately set down the knife, hastily wiping his hands.  
  
""Baby, there's an emergency at the company. I need to go in."" He removed his apron, his tone casual, even remembering to kiss her forehead. ""I've finished three dishes. Eat first, don't wait for me.""  
  
Emma said nothing, just nodded.  
  
After he left, she approached the dining table, looking at the still-steaming dishes, her chest suddenly too painful to breathe.  
  
She'd just seen clearly‚Äîthat call was from Stella.  
  
Instead of sitting down to eat as he'd asked, she called a car and followed him.  
  
Sure enough, Dominic wasn't headed to the company but to the hospital.  
  
In the VIP wing corridor, the entire floor had been cleared, with only a few doctors and nurses standing outside a room, looking tense.  
  
The hospital director was bowing apologetically to Dominic: ""Mr. Chase, we're truly sorry. It was our negligence that allowed Ms. Reed to slip in the bathroom. We'll assign additional staff and ensure this never happens again!""  
  
Dominic's face was grim, his voice icy: ""If there's a next time, this hospital won't stay in business.""  
  
The director nodded repeatedly: ""Yes, yes, we'll be extremely careful!""  
  
Emma stood at the corner, her fingernails digging into her palms.  
  
His friend had mentioned Stella only had ""minor scrapes."" Yet Dominic had reserved an entire building for her, and now that something had happened, he looked ready to tear down the hospital.  
  
The door opened, revealing Stella lying weakly against the headboard, pale-faced with reddened eyes.  
  
Dominic strode over, grabbing her hand: ""How are you? Where does it hurt?""  
  
Stella's eyes welled up, her voice choked: ""This is all my fault. Getting hit by a car was bad enough, but then falling in the shower? Now you can't even spend time with Emma... What if she gets suspicious? I'm like a walking disaster magnet...""  
  
""Don't talk nonsense,"" he scolded, though his tone remained gentle. ""Just focus on recovering. I'll stay with you these next few days.""  
  
Stella looked up with tear-filled eyes: ""But what about Emma?""  
  
Dominic replied dismissively: ""I'll handle it. Don't worry.""  
  
After a pause, he added: ""We're husband and wife. Isn't it natural for me to stay with you?""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Emma's blood instantly froze.  
  
Husband and wife? What fine words.  
  
But before she could recover, she watched Dominic remove the prayer beads from his wrist and gently place them on Stella's hand.  
  
""And stop calling yourself a disaster,"" he said. ""These blessed beads‚ÄîI've worn them for seven years. Now they're yours to keep you safe.""  
  
Tears streaming down her face, Stella lunged forward with overwhelming emotion and threw herself into his arms.  
  
Emma stood outside, her vision blurring as if drowning in deep water. Her entire being felt like it was suffocating.  
  
Those prayer beads...  
  
She'd gotten them on her eighteenth birthday, crawling on her knees through the pilgrimage path, performing the traditional prostration every few yards all the way from the mountain base to the abbey summit.  
  
That day, torrential rain had soaked the ground, leaving her knees bleeding and palms raw by the time the abbot finally blessed the beads in the sacred ritual.  
  
When she returned, Dominic saw her battered state and immediately reddened eyes, pulling her into his arms, his voice trembling: ""Emma, have you lost your mind? Who made you suffer like this?""  
  
She'd smiled, placing the beads on his wrist: ""The abbot said these will keep you safe and grant you longevity.""  
  
He'd kissed her, promising: ""I'll wear them for life.""  
  
For seven years, he never removed them. Not during the most formal business occasions, not during their most intimate moments‚Äîthe beads remained on his wrist.  
  
But now, he'd placed them on another woman's hand.  
  
Witnessing this scene with her own eyes, her heart felt like it was being slowly carved open with a dull blade, the pain so intense she could barely breathe.  
  
So his ""lifetime"" had lasted just seven years.  
  
She turned to leave, her steps unsteady as if walking on cotton.  
  
By the time she returned home, night had fallen.  
  
She'd barely entered when her phone vibrated with Dominic's message:  
  
\[Baby, the company has an urgent matter abroad. I'll be gone for a few days. Don't be angry; I'll make it up to you when I return.\]  
  
Emma stared at the screen, her fingers hovering over the keyboard, trembling slightly as she typed:  
  
\[Is it really a few days for business, or a few days with your wife?\]  
  
But ultimately, she deleted the words one by one, tears falling onto the screen, blurring her vision.  
  
After that, she spent the time packing‚Äîdocuments, passport, bank cards... everything that could prove her identity went into her suitcase.  
  
Three days later, Dominic returned.  
  
He pushed open the door carrying a large bouquet of roses and a strawberry cake, smiling tenderly: ""Baby, I'm back.""  
  
Emma stood in the center of the living room, silently watching him.  
  
He approached, placing the flowers and cake on the table, reaching to embrace her: ""Work was incredibly busy these past few days, requiring my presence overseas. Otherwise, I wouldn't have left you for so long. Don't be angry, okay?""  
  
She shifted slightly, avoiding his embrace, her tone flat: ""I'm not angry. Go take care of your business.""  
  
He paused, then smiled: ""I'm done with work. Now my job is to make you happy.""  
  
He took her hand, his eyes expectant: ""I've prepared a surprise for you.""  
  
Without waiting for her response, he led her to the car.  
  
Half an hour later, they stopped before a concert hall.  
  
Emma walked inside to find the entire venue had been reserved, with people seated around, whispering as they entered:  
  
""Mr. Chase really went all out, renting the entire concert hall just for Emma!""  
  
""Word is he flew in her favorite orchestra from Europe‚Äîthey're playing exclusively for her all day long.""  
  
""That ensemble's fee has skyrocketed lately. This must have cost him seven figures, minimum.""  
  
""Please‚Äîthat's nothing. His reputation for spoiling his wife is practically legendary!""  
  
Emma stood in the brilliant light, surrounded by admiring whispers, while Dominic's tender smile filled her vision.  
  
Yet her heart felt submerged in ice water, painfully cold.  
  
He gave her grand gestures and romance, while giving another woman legal marriage.  
  
He let her live in the spotlight of public admiration, while letting another woman exist on his marriage certificate.

1ldgq7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ldgq7i/rf_abracadabra/,[RF] ABRACADABRA,"¬†

It had been a year and a half living in the city before Sam visited a psychic, or what one of his few connections in the city called a ‚Äòwitch‚Äô. If it were not for this friend, an old Uni classmate and life-long resident of metropolises, Sam would never have thought about psychics or considered subjecting himself to one.

Annie had planted seeds in all corners of his mind of witch fables. Multiple witches would be seen in a day with another of her various city friends, and each witch would convey an eerily similar message to her, and likewise to her friend, although the messages would not be the same between them. All three witches would advise Annie to stop overthinking or advise her friend to let go of the past, and each message would pertain perfectly to the subjects most current fears and problems, the current issues swirling and repeating endlessly like an animated wind GIF at the front of each mind.

It was not this anecdotal validity, however, which propelled Sam to visit the lair of one of Annie‚Äôs most revered practitioners. The idea was cemented from concept and pushed into action a week ago at a rare outing to a comedy show. It was a comic group expressly for geeks, named the *Lemur Brothers,* with pop culture references in place of first date stories, complex bits acted out theatrically, the overall production themed and storied, with detailed lighting and sound cues and interactivity and subversion. He had meant to go with another friend Ryan, perhaps his only other friend in Melbourne, but Ryan pulled out last minute due to a bizarre confluence of transport issues and nausea. Sam suspected Ryan totally flaked on him due to Ryan‚Äôs tumultuous relationship with his goth neighbour who he would sometimes be called to ‚Äòhang out‚Äô with impromptu, and so Sam reluctantly entered the venue alone, with two pre-purchased tickets, and later would wish to confer with the psychic about Ryan‚Äôs true activities.

But again, that was not exactly *why* Sam was currently en route to Psychic Zamira, via the 86 tram. *Why* was because, during his reluctant solo outing to the Lemurs, waiting awkwardly alone before the show began, sitting on a stool at his small circular table, he could not help but eavesdrop on the eclectic group besides him. A guy with a corduroy jacket had been asked what he‚Äôd been up to on that day and, despite the alternative and aesthetic vibe of the group which promised metropolitan adventure, corduroy man had been up to not all that much that Saturday. Having walked for three hours and checked out a new coffee shop he‚Äôd heard of, Sam‚Äôs interest in corduroy man‚Äôs brief summary of his Saturday lay only in its similarity to his own uneventful day.

Just this morning had Sam set out walking in his habitual park, filled as per usual with picnicked groups around thick trunks, with solo or duo floaters lying or sitting cross-legged in the green open spaces. He‚Äôd enjoyed it enough, this simple park, that he sought to find another, to perhaps lie in by midday like one of those free-spirited and unselfconscious solo drifters. One specific drifter had been his inspiration, a particularly *untethered* individual sunning like a dog. This placid man, without animal, food or book, green shirt and blue jeans, the pockets of which looked thin and empty, instantly became Sam‚Äôs hero.

A hero he wished to copy, having the requisite absence of friends or pets. He thought however that emulating here, so close to the guy in this very same park, potentially displayed more reverence for the man than he was comfortable with. Someone might notice the veneration, the influence would be writ on his sun-bathed face, and onlookers would wince at the homage. And anyway, the hero had thought of it first, he had virtually claimed the park without his knowledge, with his eyes shut.

So, Sam walked to an adjacent park, less than half an hour east, listening to Crystal Castles. Although the trees were slightly thinner the park was just as pretty and had ample, green real estate for solo prospectors. Lying down, far enough away to hear only muffled chatter from a white and Asian couple, he began to embody his hero, began to simply *sun*. Like a dog he relaxed and *sunned*, and for a minute it was quite nice. Before the Asian woman said to the white man, raising her voice:

‚ÄòI don‚Äôt even know what that means, tell me what that means.‚Äô

‚ÄòOkay don‚Äôt make it a thing, I still want to move in together,‚Äô said the guy.

‚ÄòYou can‚Äôt just say you already have two cats as a reason, what does that even mean,‚Äô she said.

‚ÄòOkay listen,‚Äô said the guy.

Because these two were now arguing, their earshot range expanded for the foreseeable future, and Sam‚Äôs peace was shattered. Slightly defeated and lethargic, he went to the nearest caf√© for a latte and a sandwich. He hadn‚Äôt fully known what he sought to achieve, but he knew he hadn‚Äôt succeeded.

So, when, that night, Sam heard the corduroy guy at the comedy show talk about his three-hour walk and his coffee shop, he felt the light pang of defeat return to his bowels. He had been unambitious and had still failed. Then and there he resolved to see a psychic tomorrow afternoon, to have a better story than the corduroy guy, and to escape the constrictive and disappointing world of parks and coffee shops and cafes.

It did not disappoint, initially. Through two colourful and decorated doors, Zamira‚Äôs occult room was setup within her apartment. Passing through from the front door to the room with Zamira, he saw a woman dig into the fridge and grab some afternoon pulp free OJ. They made eye contact, and she smiled wryly as Sam entered the den.

They sat down on large cushions on top of thick carpets, across from each other in the vibrant room. The walls consisted of tarot images that seemed to convey a looped narrative of birth, self-actualization and death. The woman had narrow features, black hair and dark brown eyes. She wore an upside-down silver triangle necklace, which stated ‚ÄòABRACADABRA‚Äô at the top and removed the last letter on each subsequent line, until the bottom line was simply ‚ÄòA‚Äô. It was by far the most interesting object in the room, although he could not remove the tackiness of the initial word from him mind.

‚ÄòYes, your name is?‚Äô she said.

‚ÄòSam.‚Äô

‚ÄòYes, nice to meet you, and your name is?‚Äô

‚ÄòNo, Sam. Samuel is my name.‚Äô

‚ÄòAh of course Samuel. It is Zamira.‚Äô

A moment of pause.

‚ÄòOkay Samuel so what would you like to discuss‚Äô

Although he had come for a story, for an experience, he did not want to insult her by acting engrossed as he was sure many did.

‚ÄòMy friend Annie has come here before and‚Ä¶‚Äô he stumbles a bit. ‚ÄòI guess I just want to know what my problem is.‚Äô

‚ÄòYour friend Annie, and where is she today?‚Äô Zamira asked, raising her left eyebrow.

‚ÄòOh well somewhere, anywhere, it‚Äôs the weekend‚Äô

‚ÄòThis is somewhere, and she is not here?‚Äô said the psychic.

‚ÄòI only thought of doing this last night, she has lots of friends, so she probably already had something on‚Äô he returned.

The psychic paused, and he felt he‚Äôd already misstep in this vague game. Before she could say something, he asked her about the down-facing triangle.

‚ÄòIt‚Äôs to send bad spirits downwards, it is a protection‚Äô she told Sam.

‚ÄòSo, it‚Äôs like a cure, not for conjuring things but for removing.‚Äô

She grimaced while nodding, and begun her attack.

‚ÄòIt is not for rabbits. And are you seeking or are you purging?‚Äô

‚ÄòHuh?‚Äô

‚ÄòDo you wish to make or remove?‚Äô

‚ÄòWell, I was just in the park today and I thought since, uh, because-‚Äô he stammered

‚ÄòI know what your problem is‚Äô she said starkly. ‚ÄòYou have a problem with your connections, and you are seeking‚Ä¶ seeking‚Ä¶ seeking more, yes?

‚ÄòThis is a problem?‚Äô he asked, genuinely.

‚ÄòIt is your journey, your problem is your journey, this is your path right now‚Äô the witch explained.

‚ÄòI shouldn‚Äôt seek to seek? I should cure something?‚Äô he asked.

‚ÄòYou will seek, it is your path. But you must let your seeking rest, and connect. Connect with nature,‚Äô Zamira declared, with insightful eyes.

She doesn‚Äôt know about his hero, or corduroy guy or Ryan, he thought. She clearly doesn‚Äôt know about yesterday, about why he‚Äôs here.

‚ÄòOkay listen I tried that. Yesterday I tried to be all placid and just *sun* in a park, really just sat there in the grass and *sunned* like a dog or something, and it didn‚Äôt work out‚Äô he retorted.

‚ÄòYes, and you gave up too easily, to *sun*‚Äô the witch said.

‚ÄòI mean what the frick, how would you know?‚Äô Sam said, peeved.

The witch closed her eyes momentarily, and then reopened them, more knowing and piercing than before. Sam mixed an exasperated sign with a short chuckle. He saw why Annie liked her. He gathered himself.

‚ÄòWhat I really want to know is what Ryan was doing last night, can you tell me that?‚Äô Sam said calmly.

‚ÄòBut Samuel, you came to know your problems, remember. I cannot tell you everything‚Äô

‚ÄòAnd my problem is my path?

‚ÄòYes,‚Äô she said, smiling,

‚ÄòOkay but tell me about Ryan. I mean he still hasn‚Äôt paid me back for the ticket yet, so I deserve to know.‚Äô

‚ÄòSamuel, it is not Ryan that is your path, but yourself.‚Äô

‚ÄòI am my path am my problem am my journey, and I should let seeking dogs *sun*, I get it, but what about Ryan?‚Äô

‚ÄòRyan was occupied,‚Äô she finally admitted, and he was briefly satisfied. He was tempted to push further, but having both relayed her general advice to her half-mockingly, and been given an answer to his trivial question, he felt at a loss. After re-entering previous circles and going round in them, he left the apartment with no pulp free OJ drinking roommate in sight.

Since it wasn‚Äôt even 5pm yet and he was a caffeine addict, he entered the only open caf√© he could find, replaying the bizarre encounter in his mind. To his surprise, there was a slight line at the place. In front of him in line was a woman around his age with a Crystal Castles t-shirt. He wished to say something but didn‚Äôt want to start a conversation by tapping on her shoulder or start the conversation with her back turned to him. He dropped a coin so that it would roll past her and, hopefully, she could pick it up and return it to him. Then he would mention how much he loves Crystal Castles, specifically Suffocation and Empathy, and the conversation would begin in a natural manner. When he dropped the coin however, a passerby walking the opposite direction stopped it with his foot perpendicular to her, and she only glanced momentarily sideways with her dark blue eyes as the man gave him the twenty cents back. Because it was sunset he had hope though, that she might want to look back at the forming colours in the sky in the window behind her. He thought surely this might happen in the few minutes before she was called to order, and further wished it with all hope he had left in him for the weekend, thinking to himself and even muttering, ABRACADABRA, ABRACADBRA, ABRACADABRA. But then he remembered that was not how the spell worked, and the woman remained looking ahead towards the counter, waiting to order, and the minutes passed.",1,1750144330.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1ldgq6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1ldgq6d/when_his_first_love_got_pregnant_i_carried_his/,"When His First Love Got Pregnant, I Carried His Rival's Baby Novel My husband Carter Kingsley's whole family has never liked me.","Chapter 1  
  
My husband Carter Kingsley's whole family has never liked me.  
  
That much, I've always known.  
  
His father avoids all family matters like the plague.  
  
His mother looks down on my middle-class background.  
  
And Carter?  
  
His heart was never mine to begin with.  
  
But our son, Ethan Kingsley, is six now.  
  
Bright. Charming.  
  
And I just couldn't bring myself to leave him.  
  
He even started learning French‚Äîand picked it up fast.  
  
Now he and Carter talk in French around the house like it's their own secret club.  
  
At first, I was proud.  
  
A child I gave birth to, so smart, making his father proud.  
  
It made me want to hold on to this family, even just a little longer.  
  
Until I started secretly studying French myself.  
  
And slowly, I began to understand what they were really saying.  
  
And little by little, my heart froze over.  
  
Turns out my own child, just like his father, was learning French not for school,  
  
But to please Vivienne‚Äîthe woman Carter's always loved.  
  
Vivienne, the childhood sweetheart who went off to France for grad school.  
  
They were inseparable once,  
  
But Carter's churchgoing, conservative parents rejected her‚Äî  
  
Not for who she was, but because a pastor-turned-""counselor"" told them she was a poor match for the Kingsley legacy.  
  
Meanwhile, I‚Äîa girl from an average Ohio family‚Äîwas married into this Manhattan dynasty because that same counselor said I would bring ""stability and prosperity.""  
  
So I spent the last seven years in a marriage built on a prophecy‚Äîand completely devoid of love.  
  
I was lost in thought when the sharp clang of Carter's fork against his plate snapped me out of it.  
  
He frowned like he always does when I take a second too long to think.  
  
""Vivienne's back in the States. She's pregnant.""  
  
""She'll be moving in so we can help take care of her.""  
  
His eyes locked on me, full of warning.  
  
""She's carrying a child now. Don't start any drama.""  
  
Yeah. Pregnant women are delicate.  
  
Funny how that didn't apply when I was the one pregnant.  
  
Back then, only the baby mattered‚Äînever me.  
  
Even when I hemorrhaged during labor,  
  
As long as Ethan made it out of the delivery room alive,  
  
Carter never even came to check if I survived.  
  
I nodded.  
  
I didn't ask who the baby's father was.  
  
Back in the day, if Vivienne had tried to get even close to this house,  
  
I would've lost my mind.  
  
I fought. Screamed.  
  
And Carter only ever gave me cold indifference.  
  
But now, after understanding everything they whisper in French, I felt nothing.  
  
""I'll move out for a while,"" I said.  
  
""Give her space to rest.""  
  
Carter paused.  
  
Before he could respond, Ethan lit up with joy.  
  
""If Mommy's gone, does that mean I can be with Aunt Vivienne every day?""  
  
Even the smartest kid can't hide how he really feels.  
  
Carter stared into my eyes.  
  
Was he trying to figure out what I was planning?  
  
Or if I even had the strength left to care?  
  
For a second, maybe I imagined it‚Äîbut I thought I saw something soft flicker in his gaze.  
  
Still, Vivienne and her baby came first.  
  
Carter said gently, ""The house is big. No need to move out.  
  
But we have a place out in Westchester.  
  
I'll have it signed over to you.  
  
You can go there whenever you want‚Ä¶ clear your head.""  
  
I understood.  
  
This was my reward for ""being mature.""  
  
He hated that I might have tainted the family line.  
  
So now he was making sure his first love could carry their perfect child.  
  
No matter the cost.  
  
And he was willing to be generous about it.  
  
Which made me wonder‚Äî  
  
When the baby I'm carrying is born, will he be even more generous?  
  
After all, this time, I made sure Carter has nothing to do with it.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Vivienne moved in early that morning.  
  
I was in the garden watering and trimming my cosmos flowers.  
  
They were the only things in this cold, loveless house that bloomed because of me.  
  
Vivienne held her pregnant belly with one hand, covering her nose with the other.  
  
""Don't bother trimming them,"" she said with a dramatic sigh.  
  
""I can't stand the smell. Just get rid of them.""  
  
I stood and wiped some dirt off my cheek.  
  
Vivienne squinted at me, then seemed to realize something.  
  
""Oh‚Äîsorry, didn't realize it was you, Sienna.""  
  
'I thought you were the gardener.""  
  
She offered a tight smile.  
  
""Well, if these flowers are yours, I guess you'd be too sentimental to tear them out.""  
  
""I'll just deal with it.""  
  
Carter, standing beside her with a hand on her lower back, frowned.  
  
""You're pregnant. You don't have to ‚Äòdeal with' anything.""  
  
""It's just a bunch of flowers. Get rid of them.""  
  
I glanced down at the garden and gave a small smile.  
  
Carter thought I was hesitating, ready to scold me.  
  
But instead, I nodded.  
  
""Sure. I've got something to do soon anyway.""  
  
""Just have the gardener take care of it.""  
  
Carter paused, caught off guard by how calmly I agreed.  
  
For a second, I thought I saw a flicker of sympathy in his eyes.  
  
""I'll have them replanted at the Westwood property,"" he said softly.  
  
""I know you put a lot into them.""  
  
I did love those flowers.  
  
They were one of the few things I had to hold on to in this house.  
  
But now, it didn't matter anymore.  
  
""Whatever you think is best,"" I replied.  
  
I checked my phone‚Äîmy meeting with the investigator was in thirty minutes.  
  
I gave them both a polite nod.  
  
""Excuse me.""  
  
As I stepped past Carter, he suddenly grabbed my wrist.  
  
Vivienne looked at him, confused and slightly annoyed.  
  
He let go immediately.  
  
""Come back early,"" he said.  
  
""There's something I need to talk to you about.""  
  
I nodded.  
  
""Sure.""  
  
The moment I left the Kingsley estate, I could breathe again.  
  
Even if it was just for a little while.  
  
I met the investigator at a coffee shop downtown‚Äîthe same one I used to frequent back in college.  
  
The owner did a double take when she saw me.  
  
I guess I didn't look like the girl she remembered.  
  
Ever since marrying Carter, I hadn't really lived.  
  
The Kingsleys thought places like this were too... common.  
  
The investigator handed me a file.  
  
""The ultrasound confirms Vivienne is about four months along.""  
  
""Which... doesn't match Mr. Kingsley's timeline.""  
  
So Carter's miracle child‚Äîwasn't even his.  
  
If he found out, would he be disgusted?  
  
Would he still want the baby just because it's Vivienne's?  
  
I looked up at the investigator.  
  
""If I don't divorce him, my child still has inheritance rights, right?""  
  
""Of course,"" he said without hesitation.  
  
I pressed a hand to my belly.  
  
""And what if the baby's not his?""  
  
He blinked, visibly thrown.  
  
""Well... if you're married, he's still legally obligated to support the child. But‚Äî""  
  
I cut him off with a shake of my head.  
  
That was all I needed to hear.  
  
If Carter expected me to raise his child with Vivienne...  
  
Then why couldn't I let him raise a child that wasn't his?  
  
Chapter 3  
  
When I got home, Eleanor Kingsley was fussing over Vivienne like she was a princess.  
  
They both looked up the moment I walked in.  
  
Their smiles dropped.  
  
Carter frowned.  
  
""Didn't I tell you not to come back yet?""  
  
I chuckled.  
  
""You told me to come back early.""  
  
""Said you had something to talk about.""  
  
Carter hesitated.  
  
He clearly forgot.  
  
He cleared his throat.  
  
""Doesn't matter now.""  
  
""The annual family dinner‚ÄîVivienne's handling it this year.""  
  
Every year, I handled that dinner.  
  
Because I was the Kingsley family's official wife.  
  
It was my duty.  
  
Eleanor nitpicked everything I ever did for those dinners.  
  
The menu, the flowers, the lighting‚Äînothing was ever good enough.  
  
But at least it came with the title.  
  
Now that Vivienne was here, even that had been handed to her.  
  
I gave a tight-lipped smile.  
  
""Sure. It's your house, your call.""  
  
Carter frowned, like he expected me to fight back.  
  
Eleanor sniffed, pleased. ""At least you know your place.""  
  
She turned to Vivienne, her voice warm.  
  
""If you run into any trouble, just let me know, sweetheart.""  
  
Vivienne gave her a bashful smile, and Carter melted all over again.  
  
They launched into planning, forgetting I was still in the room.  
  
Laughing together.  
  
Ethan sat beside Vivienne, gently patting her belly.  
  
""This dinner's for my baby brother!""  
  
They looked like the perfect little family.  
  
And I‚Äî  
  
I was just background noise.  
  
I walked upstairs without another word.  
  
For days, I stayed out of sight.  
  
They loved it.  
  
Everyone was busy helping Vivienne plan the big event.  
  
But this wasn't her world.  
  
She got overwhelmed quickly.  
  
I overheard her one evening, curled up in Carter's arms.  
  
""I can't even get a stupid dinner right... I'm useless.""  
  
Carter held her tighter.  
  
""No, baby. You're doing great. It's your first time.""  
  
The next night, Carter knocked on my door.  
  
That alone was unusual.  
  
When I opened it, he didn't waste time.  
  
""Vivienne's overwhelmed.""  
  
""She's pregnant, and this dinner is a lot. Help her out.""  
  
I smiled.  
  
""When I handled my first dinner, I was eight months pregnant.""  
  
He looked surprised.  
  
Like he'd only just remembered that.  
  
Back then, I was on my feet every day, planning menus and centerpieces, weeks from giving birth.  
  
No one offered to help.  
  
No one cared.  
  
And now?  
  
A little guilt on his face didn't mean a damn thing.  
  
I cut him off before he could apologize.  
  
""I'll help with the background stuff.""  
  
'Let her handle the main event. She deserves to shine, right?""  
  
Carter blinked, clearly thrown.  
  
""You're really okay letting her take the spotlight?""  
  
After all, the dinner was always the First Lady's stage.  
  
And I was giving it up.  
  
""She is carrying the next Kingsley,"" I said calmly.  
  
Carter opened his mouth like he wanted to say something else.  
  
But I'd already closed the door.  
  
He stood there for a while.  
  
Maybe realizing I wasn't the woman who used to beg for his attention.  
  
Maybe realizing I didn't need him anymore.

**9. Saba ‚Äì ""Busy / Sirens""**

And somehow, I feel like I‚Äôm finally waking up.","It‚Äôs been four days since he left. No big fight. No screaming. Just a quiet, tired conversation on a Thursday night where he said he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt feel it anymore.‚Äù I don‚Äôt even know what I said back. I think I just nodded. I think I just let him go.

And I cried. God, I cried. The kind of crying that doesn‚Äôt sound like crying,  the kind where your body just folds into itself and your chest forgets how to rise. I didn‚Äôt eat for two days. My hands shook when I tried to make coffee. Everything felt heavy. Like grief. Like I lost someone in a car crash I didn‚Äôt even see coming.

But then something strange started happening. Little things.

I made eggs at 2AM because I was hungry and no one was there to judge me for it.

I played that dumb pop song he used to roll his eyes at and danced alone in the kitchen with a glass of wine in my hand, barefoot, a little drunk, crying and smiling at the same time.

I opened a journal I hadn‚Äôt touched in a year. I lit the candle he said gave him a headache. I fell asleep in the middle of the bed.

And slowly, I‚Äôm realizing‚Ä¶ maybe I wasn‚Äôt actually happy. Maybe I was just surviving. Maybe I was holding onto a version of him that stopped existing a long time ago,  the version who used to hold my hand in traffic and kiss my forehead while I slept. The version who said he loved my laugh before he started saying I talked too much.

He didn‚Äôt break my heart. He just walked away from it.

And now I‚Äôm here. Sitting in a house that feels a little too quiet, a little too cold. But it‚Äôs mine again. Every inch of it. Every plan I make, every night I spend alone, every decision, it‚Äôs mine.

It still hurts. I won‚Äôt pretend it doesn‚Äôt. I still reach for my phone sometimes to tell him something dumb I saw on TV. I still sleep on one side of the bed. I still forget sometimes that I‚Äôm not waiting for his car to pull in the driveway.

But there‚Äôs something peaceful in this kind of pain. Like standing barefoot in the ashes of everything you lost‚Ä¶ and feeling the first hints of warmth rise from beneath.

He left.

And I think I‚Äôm finally learning how to stay with myself.",4,1750143971.0,confessions,0,1.0,False
1ldgn12,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiehackers/comments/1ldgn12/why_is_sam_ditching_his_4k_mrr_ai_business/,Why Is Sam Ditching His $4K MRR AI Business?,"Hey everyone,

So I had this wild conversation last week that I can't stop thinking about...

I was grabbing coffee with this founder (let's call him ""Sam"") who built something that honestly blew my mind. We're talking about a simple AI tool that went from zero to $4K MRR in less than a year.

But here's the kicker - he's thinking about moving on from it.

**The Story So Far...**

Sam had this crazy idea back in early 2024. ""What if I could turn any text into professional visual content with just AI?""

Instead of building in a cave for months, this guy was smart. He threw up a simple landing page, got 400 people to put down money for something that didn't exist yet, and then built the entire thing in 3 weeks.3 WEEKS. ü§Ø**The Numbers Game**

Here's where it gets interesting:

* Started: January 2024
* Current MRR: $4,000+
* Total Revenue: Almost $90K in less than a year
* Profit margins: 86% (yes, you read that right)
* Monthly costs: Under $200

But wait, there's more...

**The Viral Moment**

So Sam posts one piece of content on social media in December. Just one post.

Result? 1 MILLION views and $30K in revenue that month alone.

I'm sitting there thinking ""this guy accidentally created a viral marketing machine.""

**The Plot Twist**

Here's where the story gets wild. Sam has 240,000 people using the free version. 240K!

And he's barely marketing it. No SEO. No paid ads. No content strategy. Just posting randomly on social and some basic affiliate stuff.

His conversion rates? 30-35% from visitor to signup. 3-6% from free to paid.

Do the math on what happens when you actually try to market this thing... üöÄ**The Tech Stuff (For the Nerds)**

* Built on Next.js and MongoDB
* Uses Gemini API for AI (super cost-efficient)
* Fully automated with modern infrastructure
* AI processing costs: $30 per 10,000 pieces of content

This isn't some hacky script. It's a proper, scalable SaaS.

**The reality is:** Good businesses with real revenue and growth don't stay available long. And founders like Sam who are ready to move on? They deserve to work with people who appreciate what they've built.

**So if that's you...**

Text me. Let's talk. Even if it's just to bounce ideas around about what your business could be worth or what your options might look like.

You've probably got questions. I've probably got answers. Or at least some decent coffee shop conversation about the wild world of building and selling AI businesses.

What do you think? Ready to explore what's possible?

**The Connection That Changed Everything**

Here's where it gets interesting. I'd been working with someone who was specifically looking for exactly this type of opportunity - a profitable AI tool with proven product-market fit and huge growth potential.

I made an introduction.

**The Perfect Match**

Turns out, it was exactly what my client was looking for:

* Profitable business with real revenue
* Proven viral marketing capability
* Untapped growth potential with proper marketing
* Modern tech stack that could scale
* Motivated founder ready for the right transition

Two Weeks Later...

Sam sent this: ""I'm already working on my next idea, and knowing my previous business is with someone who actually enjoys the scaling part? Best outcome possible.""

The new owner is loving their first acquisition - already talking about expansion plans. Funny how the same business can be a burden for one person and an opportunity for another.

Ah, Mondays. Let's be honest, they're often a slog, a slow climb out of the weekend's cozy embrace. The alarm rings, the coffee brews (hopefully strong enough), and the work emails begin to pile up. There's a collective sigh across the nation as we navigate the start of another week. But just beyond that predictable drudgery lies a sweet spot, a little pocket of possibility, often overlooked. And nestled right there, between the Monday blues and the midweek hump, is the magic of flying on a Tuesday. Why Tuesday, you ask? Well, strap in, because we're about to explore the fascinating world of aviation on what might just be the unsung hero of travel days. Forget the frenzied Friday departures or the chaotic Sunday returns. Tuesdays, my friends, offer a different kind of travel experience, and it's one you absolutely ought to consider. It‚Äôs like the quiet hum after a storm, a moment of calm before the next wave. So, what is it that makes flights on Tuesday such a compelling option for savvy travelers? Let's dive in.

**Why Tuesday Might Just Be Your Cheapest Ticket to Paradise**

We‚Äôve all heard the rumors, the travel folklore passed down through generations of budget-conscious globetrotters: flying on Tuesdays is cheaper. But is it just a clever marketing ploy, or is there some genuine truth to this whispered wisdom? It turns out, there's a whole lot of truth to it, and it's rooted in the fundamental principles of supply and demand. Think about it. Most people, if they have the flexibility, prefer to extend their weekends. They want to leave on a Friday afternoon or Saturday morning and return on a Sunday evening. This creates peak travel periods, a veritable rush hour in the sky, where airlines can charge a premium for those convenient departure and arrival times. But Tuesdays? Tuesdays are different. They fall smack-dab in the middle of the traditional work week, a time when fewer leisure travelers are looking to jet off. And fewer travelers mean less demand. Less demand, as any Econ 101 student will tell you, often translates to lower prices. It‚Äôs a simple equation, but in the complex world of airline pricing, it can make a world of difference. So, while there are never any guarantees in the unpredictable world of airfare, historical data and industry trends consistently point to Tuesday as being a prime contender for scoring a good deal. It's like finding a hidden ten-dollar bill in your old jacket ‚Äì a pleasant surprise you didn‚Äôt see coming.

**Unpacking the ""Magic"" Behind Cheaper Flights on Tuesdays**

It's not just about the lack of weekend warriors, though that's a significant factor. There are a few other gears turning behind the scenes that contribute to the potential for discovering those sweet, sweet Tuesday bargains. Airlines are brilliant at dynamic pricing, constantly analyzing booking trends and adjusting fares accordingly. When they see a dip in demand for a particular route on a Tuesday, they're more likely to lower prices to entice passengers to fill those seats. Empty seats, after all, are lost revenue. They'd much rather sell a seat at a slightly lower price than have it fly empty. Furthermore, business travelers, who often book their trips well in advance and aren't as price-sensitive as leisure travelers, are less likely to be flying on a Tuesday afternoon. Their travel patterns often involve Monday morning departures and Thursday or Friday returns. This leaves Tuesdays ‚Äì particularly mid-morning and afternoon flights ‚Äì with a potential surplus of availability. It's like the quiet hours at a popular restaurant ‚Äì fewer people vying for a table, making it easier to snag a prime spot. So, when you‚Äôre searching for flights on Tuesday, you‚Äôre potentially tapping into a time when the airlines are most eager to offer incentives to get you in the air.

**Beyond the Price Tag: More Perks of Pursuing Flights on Tuesday**

While the possibility of saving a few bucks is a major draw, the advantages of flying on a Tuesday extend far beyond your wallet. Think about the airport experience. Peak travel times can be, to put it mildly, a bit of a zoo. Long security lines, crowded departure gates, packed airplanes ‚Äì it can all feel a little‚Ä¶ overwhelming. But on a Tuesday? Things tend to be a bit more relaxed. Security checkpoints are often less congested, check-in counters are less swamped, and the overall atmosphere feels a little more‚Ä¶ breathable. Imagine breezing through security instead of being stuck in a serpentine queue that seems to stretch to infinity. Picture finding an empty seat at your gate without having to circle like a hawk. These little conveniences can significantly improve your travel experience, making the journey itself feel less like a hurdle and more like a part of the adventure. It‚Äôs the difference between trying to navigate a crowded city street during rush hour and taking a leisurely stroll on a quiet Sunday morning. The vibe is just different, in a good way.

**Navigating the Search: Finding Those Elusive Tuesday Deals**

Okay, so you're convinced. Tuesdays are the way to go. But how do you actually find those golden tickets? While airlines don't explicitly advertise ""Tuesday Discounts,"" with a little savvy searching, you can significantly increase your chances of landing a great deal on flights on Tuesday. Here's a breakdown of strategies to employ:

- **Flexibility is Your Friend:** This is key. If you have some wiggle room with your travel dates, you can experiment with departing on a Monday evening or returning on a Wednesday morning. Sometimes, shifting your dates by just a day or two can unlock significant savings, particularly when those days include a Tuesday. Don't be rigid in your search; think of it as a treasure hunt.
- **Utilize Flight Comparison Websites:** Websites like Google Flights, Kayak, Skyscanner, and Momondo are your best friends. These platforms aggregate fares from multiple airlines, allowing you to compare prices across different carriers and times. Most of these sites also have flexible date search options, making it easy to see how prices change throughout the week.
- **Set Fare Alerts:** Many flight comparison websites and airline apps allow you to set fare alerts for specific routes. This means you'll be notified when the price of a flight you're interested in drops. This is particularly helpful if you're planning a trip in advance; you can snag a deal as soon as it becomes available.
- **Be Open to Different Airports:** Sometimes, flying into or out of a smaller, less busy airport near your intended destination can be cheaper, especially on Tuesdays. Consider if there are any alternative airports within a reasonable distance that might offer more competitive fares.
- **Consider Loyalty Programs and Credit Card Points:** If you're a frequent flyer or have travel rewards credit cards, check if you can use your points or miles to book flights on Tuesday. Sometimes, using rewards points can offer even greater savings than finding a cheap cash fare.
- **Check Airline Websites Directly:** While comparison sites are great for an overview, sometimes booking directly through the airline's website can offer exclusive deals or promotions. It's always worth doing a quick check on the airline's site after you've found a potential deal on a comparison platform.
- **Clear Your Browser Cookies:** Airlines and travel websites can sometimes track your searches and potentially increase prices based on your interest. Clearing your browser cookies before searching for flights can sometimes help you see the true, uninflated prices. It's a small step, but every little bit helps when you're trying to find a bargain.

Following these tips will put you in a much stronger position to find those coveted deals on **flights on Tuesday**. It's like having a secret map to buried treasure, only the treasure is a significantly cheaper flight!

""Save up to 90% on flights with these amazing deals: https://educdunet.com/""

**Tales from the Tuesday Trail: Real-Life Examples**

Let me paint you a picture. My friend Sarah was planning a last-minute trip to visit her sister in Chicago. She started searching for flights on a Thursday for a Saturday departure, and the prices were eye-watering! We're talking hundreds of dollars for a relatively short flight. Dejected, she was about to give up when I suggested she check for flights on Tuesday. Hesitantly, she ran the search, and lo and behold, the same route, same airline, just two days later, was nearly 40% cheaper! She was ecstatic. This isn't an isolated incident; I've heard countless stories from fellow travelers who have experienced similar price drops by shifting their travel dates to include a Tuesday. It's not a guarantee, of course, and sometimes other factors influence pricing (like major events or holidays), but the pattern is undeniable. Another friend, Mark, was planning a family vacation to Orlando. He was initially set on flying out on a Friday, but after seeing the astronomical prices, he decided to gamble on a Tuesday departure. Not only were the flights significantly cheaper, but the airport felt less chaotic, and even the lines for attractions in Orlando seemed a little shorter during the week. It just goes to show that the benefits of Tueday travel extend beyond the initial flight cost.

**The Semantic Web of Tuesday Flights: Keywords and Concepts at Play**

When we talk about ""flights on Tuesday,"" we're not just talking about that specific phrase. The digital landscape is a lot more nuanced. Search engines are getting smarter, understanding the underlying intent behind a user's query. So, when someone searches for ""flights on Tuesday,"" they might also be interested in related concepts and keywords. Think about it:

- **Cheap flights Tuesday:** This is a no-brainer, directly related to the core benefit of flying on this day.
- **Best day to fly:** Users are looking for the most advantageous time to travel, and Tuesday often emerges as a strong contender.
- **Tuesday airfare:** A direct synonym for flights on Tuesday.
- **Midweek flights:** Grouping Tuesday with other weekdays (Wednesday, Thursday) as a potentially cheaper travel period.
- **Discount flights Tuesday:** Focusing on the potential for reduced prices.
- **Airline deals Tuesday:** Referring to promotions and special offers available on this specific day.
- **Tuesday travel deals:** A broader term encompassing not just flights but potentially hotel and package deals as well.
- **Flying during the week:** A general search that might lead users to discover the advantages of Tuesday travel.
- **Off-peak travel:** Tuesdays fall squarely within the off-peak travel period for many routes.
- **Saving money on flights:** The ultimate goal for many travelers looking for Tuesday flights.

Understanding these related terms helps us see the bigger picture of what people are searching for when they're considering flying on a Tuesday. It's like understanding the interconnectedness of different highways leading to the same destination ‚Äì the destination being a well-informed traveler who knows when and how to find a good deal.

**A Deeper Dive into Airline Pricing Models (Without Making Your Eyes Glaze Over)**

Okay, let's get a tiny bit technical, but I promise to keep it light! Airlines use sophisticated algorithms and data analysis to determine flight prices. These algorithms consider a multitude of factors, including:

1. **Demand:** As we've discussed, high demand equals high prices.
2. **Time of Booking:** Booking too early or too late can sometimes be more expensive. There‚Äôs a sweet spot, and it often involves Wednesdays (more on that below!)
3. **Competitor Pricing:** Airlines constantly monitor what their rivals are charging and adjust their prices accordingly.
4. **Historical Data:** Airlines analyze past booking patterns for specific routes at specific times of the year.
5. **Fuel Costs:** Fluctuations in fuel prices can impact airfare.
6. **Special Events:** Major conferences, festivals, or holidays in a destination will drive up prices, regardless of the day of the week.

While the timing of these factors can be complex, the drop in leisure traveler demand on Tuesdays consistently plays a significant role in potentially lower fares. It‚Äôs a bit like a giant, ever-changing puzzle where Tuesday fits into a piece that often results in a more favorable outcome for the consumer.

**Is Wednesday the New Tuesday? Exploring the Nuances**

You might have heard the whispers: Wednesday is actually the cheapest day to book, not necessarily to fly. And there's some truth to that! Many airlines release new batches of discounted fares on Tuesday nights or early Wednesday mornings. This is often in response to analyzing booking data from the start of the week and adjusting prices based on unsold inventory. However, while Wednesday might be a good day to *book* a flight, Tuesday remains a potentially excellent day to *fly* on. The reasons we've discussed ‚Äì lower demand, fewer business travelers, etc. ‚Äì still apply to Tuesdays. So, think of it this way: Tuesday is a great day to depart, and Wednesday morning might be a good time to start searching for those Tuesday departures! It's about understanding the dance between when to look and when to go.

**Beyond the Tuesday Takeoff: Maximizing Your Midweek Travel**

Flying on a Tuesday isn't just about the flight itself; it can also open up opportunities for a more relaxed and potentially less expensive trip overall.

- **Hotel Savings:** Just like flights, hotels often have lower occupancy rates during the week, especially on Tuesday nights. This can lead to discounted room rates.
- **Reduced Crowds at Destinations:** Popular tourist attractions and restaurants can be less crowded during the week, allowing for a more enjoyable and less rushed experience. Imagine not having to wait in line for an hour at that famous museum or getting a reservation at that trendy restaurant without a problem.
- **Easier Car Rentals:** Rental car agencies often have more availability and potentially lower prices during the week.
- **More Flexible Itineraries:** With fewer crowds and potentially more availability, you can often be more spontaneous with your plans and enjoy a more relaxed pace.

Opting for flights on Tuesday can create a ripple effect of benefits throughout your entire trip. It's like choosing the scenic route instead of the crowded highway ‚Äì a more enjoyable journey from start to finish.

**Dangling Modifiers and the Glamour of Tuesday Travel (A Lighthearted Aside)**

Speaking of which, consider this: ""Thinking about savings, flights on Tuesday offer a compelling option."" Clearly, it's not the flights that are doing the thinking, but the traveler! This is a classic dangling modifier. But in the context of finding a great travel deal, who's complaining? We're too busy dreaming of that beach or that mountain view. The point is, sometimes in the enthusiasm of planning a trip, a little grammatical quirkiness is forgivable, especially when you‚Äôre scoring a deal on flights on Tuesday. It just adds to the human element of the travel experience, doesn't it? We're not robots meticulously crafting perfect sentences; we're excited individuals hoping to get somewhere without breaking the bank.

**The Interjections of Travel Planning: ""Wow!"" ""Eureka!"" ""Finally!""**

The process of finding and booking a flight can be a roller coaster of emotions. You start with hope, fueled by the possibility of a great deal. Then comes the search, which can be frustrating at times, filled with fluctuating prices and confusing options. But then, just as you‚Äôre about to give up, you see it ‚Äì that amazing price for flights on Tuesday. ""Wow!"" you exclaim. ""Eureka!"" you think, you've found it! ""Finally!"" the relief washes over you. These interjections are the punctuation marks of the travel planning process, highlighting the highs and lows of the journey before the actual journey even begins. And discovering a fantastic Tuesday deal? That definitely warrants a joyous interjection or two.

**Colloquialisms and the Airport Vibe**

Let's be real, airport conversations are often full of colloquialisms. You hear people talking about ""red-eyes,"" ""bumping"" passengers, and ""connecting flights."" When you're flying on a Tuesday, the vibe is often less frantic, giving you a little more space to absorb these colorful bits of airport lingo without feeling completely overwhelmed. You might even overhear someone saying, ""Yeah, I always try to fly on a Tuesday, it's usually a steal."" See? The word is out. Tuesdays are where it's at for potentially cheaper and more relaxed air travel. It's part of the vernacular of the savvy traveler.

**The Future of Tuesday Flights: Will the Trend Continue?**

So, is the ""Tuesday is cheaper"" phenomenon here to stay? While it's impossible to predict the future with absolute certainty, the fundamental reasons why Tuesdays are often less expensive ‚Äì lower leisure traveler demand, airline pricing strategies ‚Äì are likely to persist. As long as the traditional work week structure remains largely in place, fewer people will have the flexibility to take off on a Tuesday for a weekend trip. However, the travel landscape is constantly evolving. The rise of remote work, for example, is giving more people flexibility in their schedules. This *could* potentially lead to more people traveling on weekdays, including Tuesdays. But for now, and likely for the foreseeable future, Tuesdays remain a strong contender for finding those coveted cost-effective flights.

""Save up to 90% on flights with these amazing deals: https://educdunet.com/""

**In Conclusion: Embracing the Tuesday Advantage**

Let's wrap this up, shall we? Flying on a Tuesday isn't just about a potential discount, although let's be honest, that's a pretty significant draw. It's about a different kind of travel experience. It's about navigating a less crowded airport, enjoying a more relaxed flight, and potentially extending those feelings of tranquility to your destination. It's about being a savvy traveler who understands the rhythms of the travel industry and knows how to capitalize on quieter periods. So the next time you're planning a trip, don't automatically default to the weekend. Ponder the possibilities of a Tuesday takeoff. Explore the flight options for that seemingly mundane day in the middle of the week. You might just find yourself pleasantly surprised by the prices, the crowds, and the overall ease of your journey.

I'm 21 in good health, athleticish and work a semi high stress job. I had been using them on and off (mostly on) for about a year at 6 mgs maybe 8 a day-ish? I've tried to quit a couple of times but stress has always got the better of me. I've recently been experiencing a lot of anxiety and random panic when getting in cars/closed spaces (that's just fight or flight! your poor amygdala is constantly cooked by the hyperactivation of your nervous system be nice to it) and so I decided to quit for good. First week was honestly not as bad for me as I'm fairly used to quitting nicotine products and I knew it was just a mental thing (avoid triggers, drink a shit ton of water and piss out the nicotine, socialize take your mind of it etc.). However, around midway through week 2 I had a huge panic attack on a run outside and I had about a week long stretch of feeling insane panic, agorophobia, and anxiety spells. This was all made worse because I was experiencing significant depersonalization/derealization leading me to dread leaving my house. This lasted for about a week and a half and I was really close to seeing a therapist and then I finally found this sub and now I realize that I was an idiot for thinking abusing the shit out of my nervous system for a year would be without consequences.

 That being said last few days have been so much better and I'm not going to see a therapist/ try to get medicated because I really don't want to replace addictions with other dependences. What has really worked for me: 

\- holy shit get 8 + hours of sleep every night I cant even explain how much of a difference it makes 

\- I cut out a good amount of caffeine (I usually drink quite a lot but have switched to a single coffee in the morning after my food and coconut water for the gym instead of an energy drink) 

\-Morning cortisol spikes + usually that's the ""best zyn of the day"" = super shitty morning anxiety, so be kind to yourself, eat tons of food in the morning do something that relaxes you if possible and just get over that morning hump every day (this is something I'm still struggling with but I hope it will get better in the next couple weeks) 

\-I normally take creatine for the gym and Vit d because it gets really rainy and gloomy sometimes where I'm from, also been using Magnesium Glycinate which has been super helpful for sleep and maybe even a placebo helper for my anxiety at times 

\-Go to the gym and try and go out as much as possible. If you are experiencing the derealization and agorophobia like me (wacky ass symptoms fr), the exposure to the outside world is unfortunately needed in parts to get better, be kind to yourself and take it slowly, try and do it on a day where your anxiety levels are kind of low because the other stuff gets better when the root anxiety (caused by the lack of nic and brain rewiring) is better. 

  
I will let you guys know how I'm doing in another 30 days (tryna manifest chilling and starting my new job nicotine free, it's in the healthcare industry and a lot of it is pediatric so I want to make sure I'm fully present because it's an important job to me). This sub has been the biggest comfort throughout all of this and I hope this helped someone, feel free to reach out even if its just something dumb.

I‚Äôve been working with the idea of a 3D animated action-comedy called Carnage Crew ‚Äî it‚Äôs a chaotic mix of cartoonish graphics, weird missions, and 10 mentally ill mercenaries... plus their deranged German Shepherd, Bingo Boy. üêæ

Each episode follows the crew on a new mission. I've been planning it to be kind of cartoonish and the world is kind of goofier than normal.

I have not tried modelling and animating in 3D yet but i am learning! I just wrote this for fun because I liked the idea that i got for the show. I actually finished writing the first episode called ‚ÄúBear Minimum‚Äù where the crew has to rescue a briefcase from a crashed plane in Siberia. Also the second episodes script is in the works. I've been planning to call it Trigger disipline, but i havent descided just yet.

If anyone‚Äôs curious, I‚Äôd be happy to drop the full script here. Would love any feedback on the concept, characters, tone, whatever!

Now i will give a brief rundown of the mercs personalities!

The Brawler: Probably the strongest of the crew. Usually responds with grunts. He loves beef jerky and always takes some with him everywhere.

The Bandit: A cocky, annoying, and egotistical. He always makes fun of the other mercs.

The Pyromancer: A total pyromaniac. she acts like a little girl around fires b ut when someone for example blows her match out she turns into s horror movie killer. Rarely speaks.

The ranger: Most likely the mostsane out of the crew. A surprisingly chill guy who drinks a lot of coffee. Usually the therapist of the crew.

The Gunslinger: He thinks he lives in the wild west and has a colt revolver named Lucy. He always pretends to shoot at walls, trees etc when they are not fighting.

The Hunter: Loves talking about her hunting journeys. She usually refers the enemy as prey.

The Accelerator: Probably the smartest in the crew. She is a super smart woman who always explains the missions in too much detail.

The Alchemist: She loves to experiment with different animals and always brings brews with her. She actually doesn't know that much about medical science and doesn't always know what the potions excactly did. Laughs maniacally when her experiments work.

The Demolitionist: He always shouts his sentences and loves fighting and guns. He usually changes emotions all of a suddent and usually is really reckless.

Assassin: A serious man who rarely jokes. sually is really silent.

Bingo boy: The crews german sheperd. Sometimes he acts like human opening doors and drawing on papers. He kinda terrifies the crew but they still like him.

That was every merc + Bingo Boy

I walked 3 separate times today, without even a squint of fatigue: my dog for 30 mins, I walked to my GP, and walked to the shopping to have coffee with people. I have been trying new supplements and meds recently, maybe those are actually helping.

This is all despite not even sleeping very well last night i.e. < 6 hrs, and at times today, I did feel great weakness, coughing, rapid heart-beat, very blocked nose, and in the last hour, severe brain fog.

Today is probably better than the last 20 ive had.

1ldgayd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1ldgayd/the_walls_of_my_house_are_breathing/,The walls of my house are breathing,"My girlfriend and I just moved into a new place together. It‚Äôs something we‚Äôve been working towards for years, scraping together savings, scrolling endlessly through real estate listings, going to inspections only to be disappointed or outbid. When this house appeared within our budget, it felt like a small miracle. A moment of alignment in an otherwise unpredictable housing market. It‚Äôs a modest single-story home with a decent backyard, tucked away in a quiet, comfortable part of town. The kind of place that feels lived in.

It‚Äôs not huge or fancy, but it feels right. We managed to get it for around AUD 500,000, which still feels surreal given the market these days. It still doesn‚Äôt feel quite real that we‚Äôre homeowners while still in our mid-20s. ¬†

Jen, my girlfriend, works full-time as a nurse, often on her feet for long hours. I compose music for TV and advertising, which means I‚Äôm usually based at home. While I keep fairly busy with projects, my schedule is more flexible than hers, so I usually take care of the housework and cooking. It‚Äôs a rhythm that works for us. I‚Äôm grateful that I get to do what I love creatively, while also having the time and space to explore my other interests and take care of our home.

I usually wear headphones while I work, listening to rough demos, sound libraries, or just letting a Spotify playlist play in the background. Even when I‚Äôm cleaning or folding laundry, I tend to keep something playing. Music fills the silence, keeps me moving. Which is probably why I didn‚Äôt notice the sound earlier.

It had been nearly two months since we moved in when I first heard it.

I was in the kitchen, making my second coffee of the day, when I heard it. A wheeze. Deep and nasal, like something catching its breath through dust-clogged lungs. It was subtle, almost buried under the hum of the kettle and the clink of the spoon in my mug. But it was there. Then came the creak of the floorboards. I figured it was just the house settling. Old wood, shifting temperatures, maybe even possums on the roof.

Still, something about the sound off. Almost rhythmic.

I tried to catch it again later that day, pressing pause on my music and standing still in the hallway, straining to hear something, *anything*. But the house held its silence.

A week would pass before I was certain I heard it again. Same as before, a deep wheeze followed by creaking floorboards. I tried to see if I could record it, but it went away before I could get one of my microphones from my studio. Later that night, when Jen came home from a shift, I tried talking to her about it, but after working a 12-hour shift, she wasn‚Äôt really in the mood to listen to any crazy talk from me. ‚ÄúI think you just need to get out of the house more.‚Äù she said, her voice flat, somewhere between exhaustion and irritation, as she slipped off her shoes.

At the time, I just laughed it off and agreed with her. It had to be some kind of cabin fever. So, I started spending less time at home. I would go for jogs around the suburbs instead of using the treadmill and take my laptop to local caf√©s to mix tracks, enjoying the ambient chatter and the way the afternoon sunlight filtered through the autumn leaves. For a while, it seemed to work. I didn‚Äôt notice any strange noises, and I started to feel a little more grounded again. Maybe I had just been going stir-crazy.

But that didn‚Äôt last.

One night, maybe two weeks later, I woke up around 3 a.m. The house was still. No wind, no passing cars. Just that heavy kind of silence that blankets everything in the early hours. I didn‚Äôt know why I woke up at first. Jen was snoring lightly beside me, her breathing steady. I lay there, trying to drift back off, when I heard it again.

The wheeze.

Louder this time. Closer. Wet.

I tried to wake Jen up, but her body was limp, heavy with sleep, and no matter how many times I whispered her name or nudged her shoulder, she didn‚Äôt stir. Her snores continued, undisturbed, steady and mechanical, as if on a loop.

So I got up. I grabbed my phone, turned on the flashlight, and padded down the hallway. That‚Äôs when I noticed it. The air had changed. It was heavy with the smell of mildew, and the walls seemed slick, glistening faintly in the light. I pressed my fingers against the paint, and they came away damp.

The floorboards were colder in patches and sticky beneath my feet, as if something had seeped up through the cracks. My phone's light cast long, sickly shadows that pulsed faintly, almost imperceptibly, as if the house was‚Ä¶ moving. Breathing.

I stood still. Watched. The shadows moved again. Slowly, subtly, like lungs expanding. Contracting.

The hallway exhaled.

That‚Äôs the only way I can describe it. The house let out a breath. Long and wheezing. I swear I felt it on my skin, warm and fetid, brushing the hairs on my arms.

I lifted my phone and hit record, capturing the sound before it vanished again.

I‚Äôll try to embed it in this post. But if you hear what I heard, really *hear* it, just know: it wasn‚Äôt the wind.  
It wasn‚Äôt the pipes.  
And it sure as hell wasn‚Äôt the house settling.

It was [breathing](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ma051g8amxombq17jg837/House-breathing.m4a?rlkey=hh7whno5n42shgmz6uwzwco9k&st=ou22pmp0&dl=0).

¬†

I finally managed to get Jen awake as the ‚Äúhouse‚Äù stopped it‚Äôs breathing. I showed her the recordings, once she heard the breathing, I could see a look of fearful realisation cover her face.

We spent the rest of the night huddled on the couch with all the lights on, watching the hallway like it might lurch to life again. Neither of us could sleep. The air still felt wrong, as if we were intruding on something ancient and half-asleep. The damp hadn‚Äôt gone away either. It seemed to spread, blooming like black veins along the skirting boards and ceiling corners.

The next day, we made a few calls, packed only the essentials, and left to stay at Jen‚Äôs parents‚Äô place. We didn‚Äôt tell them about the breathing. How could we? Even if they believed us, how do you explain something so absurd and terrifying? We told them someone had broken in while we were asleep, that we didn‚Äôt feel safe. That much, at least, was true.

Neither of us has gone back since. Every time we tried to go back to grab the rest of our things, something stopped us. Not physically. Just a feeling. A pressure in our chests, the closer we got, like the air itself was warning us. Like the house knew we were coming and didn‚Äôt want us back.

But we still have the deed.  
The keys.  
The debt.  
The house is still ours.

Jen hasn‚Äôt gone back to work. ‚ÄúFever,‚Äù she tells people. But most days, she just sits on the edge of the guest bed, staring. Thinking.

I‚Äôve tried calling the previous owners. The real estate agent. I‚Äôm just greeted by voicemails. I think I‚Äôll drive over. See if I can find them in person.

But just uploading your song isn't enough ‚Äî to stand out in today‚Äôs streaming jungle, **you need playlist placements**.

Spotify playlists are one of the most powerful tools for growing your fanbase, boosting your streams, and catching the eyes (and ears) of industry professionals. But with so many playlists ‚Äî and shady curators ‚Äî it‚Äôs crucial to know **how to find legit, effective playlists** and how to **submit your music the right way.**

# This guide covers:

* The different types of Spotify playlists
* How to evaluate if a playlist is organic or fake
* Step-by-step submission strategies
* Bonus tips to maximize playlist exposure

# üéß Understanding the 3 Types of Spotify Playlists

Before you start pitching your music, you must know the landscape. Spotify playlists fall into **three main categories**, and each plays a unique role in your promotional journey.

# 1. Editorial Playlists ‚Äì Curated by Spotify‚Äôs In-House Team

These are the big ones ‚Äî the holy grail of playlisting. Editorial playlists are handpicked by Spotify‚Äôs own editors and reach **millions of listeners worldwide**. They often dominate genres and trends.

# Top Editorial Playlists:

* **Today‚Äôs Top Hits** ‚Äì Over 34M followers, Spotify‚Äôs #1 pop playlist.
* **RapCaviar** ‚Äì 15M+ followers, shaping the future of hip-hop.
* **Viva Latino** ‚Äì 13.5M+ followers, the heart of Latin hits.
* **Rock Classics** ‚Äì A go-to for timeless rock tracks.
* **Beast Mode** ‚Äì High-energy tracks perfect for workouts.
* **Mint** ‚Äì A massive dance/electronic playlist with global reach.

üéØ **How to Get Featured:**  
Submit your music through [**Spotify for Artists**](https://artists.spotify.com/) *at least 7 days before release*. The more metadata you provide (genre, mood, instrumentation, story behind the song), the better chance the editors have to match your track to a playlist.

üõë **Watch Out:** No one can *guarantee* placement on Spotify editorial playlists. If someone says they can, **it‚Äôs a scam**. Spotify does not accept paid placements.

# 2. Algorithmic Playlists ‚Äì Powered by Spotify‚Äôs AI

These are personalized playlists based on each listener‚Äôs behavior ‚Äî and they‚Äôre an **incredible tool for organic growth**.

# Most Powerful Algorithmic Playlists:

* **Discover Weekly** ‚Äì Refreshed every Monday with 30 new tracks based on what the listener enjoys.
* **Release Radar** ‚Äì Features new music from artists a user follows or listens to.
* **Daily Mixes** ‚Äì Multiple playlists based on listening habits, genre preferences, and repeat songs.
* **On Repeat / Repeat Rewind** ‚Äì Showcasing favorite tracks from recent and past listening history.

# üéØ How to Trigger These Playlists:

* Get fans to **save your track**, not just stream it.
* Focus on **getting engagement in the first 72 hours**.
* Use **pre-save campaigns** and build a mailing list to notify fans before release.
* Ask listeners to **follow you** on Spotify.

Spotify‚Äôs algorithm values *real fan interaction*. The more saves, shares, and playlist adds you receive early, the more likely your music will be pushed to new listeners.

# 3. User-Generated Playlists ‚Äì Made by Independent Curators

This is where most indie artists start ‚Äî and it‚Äôs a **powerful gateway** into the Spotify ecosystem.

These playlists are created by regular users or niche curators and can range from 500 followers to hundreds of thousands. They cater to specific moods, genres, or communities.

# Popular User-Generated Playlists:

* **Lofi Girl** ‚Äì A cultural phenomenon in chill beats.
* **Rap Nation / Trap Nation** ‚Äì Curated by YouTube tastemakers.
* **Coffee & Chill / Study Vibes / Sunset Drive** ‚Äì Mood-based playlists that generate tons of passive listening.
* **Afropop Central / Amapiano Nation** ‚Äì Playlists focused on African sounds.

# üéØ Why They Matter:

* Easier to access than editorial playlists.
* Can build momentum that triggers algorithmic playlists.
* Offer niche targeting: perfect for genre-specific artists.

But be cautious: **some user-generated playlists are fake or botted**.

# üö® How to Identify Fake Playlists (And Find Real Ones)

Not every playlist with 100K followers is legitimate. Many curators use bots to inflate numbers ‚Äî which results in **zero real streams and potential damage to your artist profile**.

# üîç Spotting the Real vs Fake: A Practical Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Pick a playlist you're interested in.**
   * Preferably one in your genre with 5K‚Äì100K followers.
2. **Choose a song from the middle of the playlist.**
   * Avoid the first and last few songs to minimize skewed results.
3. **Click on the artist‚Äôs name > go to their profile.**
4. **Scroll to the ""Discovered On"" section.**
   * Click ‚ÄúSee all.‚Äù
5. **Check if the playlist shows up.**
   * If it‚Äôs one of the **top playlists listed**, it means the playlist is generating real traffic to that song.
6. **No appearance in ""Discovered On""?**
   * Likely a fake or low-engagement playlist.
   * Repeat the process with another song to be sure.

üí° *Pro Tip:* Real playlists drive visibility. If multiple artists featured on a playlist don‚Äôt show that playlist under ‚ÄúDiscovered On,‚Äù avoid it.

# üì¨ How to Submit Your Music to Spotify Playlists in 2025

Ready to pitch? There are **3 effective submission methods**:

# 1. Spotify Editorial Submission (Free)

* Go to [Spotify for Artists](https://artists.spotify.com/)
* Navigate to ‚ÄúMusic‚Äù > ‚ÄúUpcoming‚Äù
* Select the song you want to pitch
* Fill out all the metadata: genre, mood, instrumentation, culture, language, etc.
* Submit!

üìå *Do this at least 7 days before your song goes live.*

# 2. Directly Reach Out to Curators (Manual Approach)

Find playlist owners on:

* Instagram bios
* LinkedIn
* Reddit communities (e.g., r/SpotifyPlaylists)
* Playlist description boxes (some leave emails or IG handles)

Craft a **short, respectful message**:

* Personalize your pitch
* Include a direct Spotify link to the song
* Mention why your track fits the playlist's vibe

üéØ *Don‚Äôt mass email. Focus on relevance over quantity.*

# 3. Use Music Submission Platforms (Fast + Targeted)

Curator platforms allow you to pitch your track to hundreds of verified playlist owners, blogs, influencers, radio stations, and labels.

**Top Platforms:**

* SubmitHub
* Groover
* OneSubmit
* [**The Buzz Network**](https://thebuzznetwork.net/submit-music) (curator access + review guarantee)

Benefits:

* Pitch to curators by genre or mood
* Receive feedback from real people
* Refund or re-credit if no response

Wir wohnen am Stadtrand einer deutschen Gro√üstadt in einem Komplex mit mehreren H√§usern bestehend aus 1 bis 6 Wohnungen pro Eingang. Alles Erstbezug, da 2022 neu. 

Unsere Wohnung befindet sich in der ersten Etage.
Jetzt im Sommer, wo man nat√ºrlich gerne die Fenster f√ºr frische Luft offen hat und auch den Balkon nutzen m√∂chte haben wir leider ein 
Problem.

Der Mann in der Wohnung unter uns ist reger Cannabis Konsument. Das an sich w√§re uns absolut egal, kann jeder machen was er m√∂chte. 
Allerdings leiden wir schon sehr unter der daraus resultierenden Geruchsbel√§stigung.
Es riecht einfach permanent bei uns wie im Coffee Shop, sobald wir die Fenster √∂ffnen oder uns raus setzen wollen. 

Nun ist es so, dass er seine Wohnung gekauft hat, wir in unserer nur zur Miete wohnen. 
Beim aktuellen Wohnungsmarkt ist ein schneller Auszug also nicht drin.

Wir m√∂chten logischerweise auch nicht gleich eskalieren, denn wir denken nicht, dass ihm die Problematik bewusst ist.
An sich ist der Typ auch nett, h√∂rt sich zwar gerne reden, aber ist sehr umg√§nglich. 
Daher m√∂chten wir selbstverst√§ndlich zun√§chst einmal das Gespr√§ch suchen. 

Und hier kommt ihr ins Spiel: Wie sprechen wir es am besten an ohne direkt zu konfrontieren? Wie gesagt, ob er kifft oder nicht ist uns herzlich egal, solange wir nicht unter dem Geruch leiden m√ºssen. 
Wir legen Wert auf gute Nachbarschaft und wollen niemanden vor den Kopf sto√üen. Daher suchen wir nach M√∂glichkeiten das Thema sensibel anzusprechen. ",13,1750142558.0,wohnen,87,0.63,False

Says it's just as fun if not more, at the fraction of the costly alcoholic drinks and midnight taxi fares in SG","Swaying to dance music and TikTok-fuelled pop under a disco ball, young punters are packed shoulder to shoulder while sipping on coffee, their energy powered by pour-overs rather than pints.

This is no underground rave, nor a brunch gone wild. It's a caffeine-powered daytime clubbing sesh ‚Äî- part of a growing wave of alcohol-free, Gen Z-driven events gaining traction in Singapore and elsewhere in the world.

At a recent event in Singapore's trendy Duxton district, the space was jammed by 4:00 pm, with baristas churning out fancy coffees and DJs spinning back-to-back sets.

The crowd grooved with energy, even without the usual liquid courage.

""A lot of people think alcohol gives you the high, but caffeine sometimes can do that too,"" said Aden Low, 21, co-founder of Beans and Beats which organises coffee raves at different venues.

""That's why the atmosphere at our events tends to be quite energetic.""

The parties blend curated music with specialty coffee served in white paper cups.

The vibe is light, friendly and very Gen Z.

""It's also the idea that this is a safe space,"" said Esther Low, 31, who was at the event in Duxton.

""When you go to a club setting, there's usually this underlying intention to hook up. So, for me, that's personally why I would prefer this.""

Ashley Chean, a Singaporean student who has been alcohol-free for a year, said she appreciates these sober gatherings.

""When I lived in Paris, I realised I had a lot of alcoholic tendencies and I didn't want that to be my lifestyle,"" the 20-year-old told AFP.

""More and more of my friends are sober or sober curious.""

The coffee clubbing events are usually held in cafes and other spaces such as rooftop bars -- as long as there's room for DJs and baristas to do their thing while people dance.

The parties typically end by late afternoon, just in time for golden hour selfies.

1ldg8b1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nothinghappeninghere/comments/1ldg8b1/what_happened_to_america/,What happened to America?,"People keep asking, ‚ÄúWhat happened to America?‚Äù
Did it stop standing for freedom and democracy?
It‚Äôs a real tragedy.
Because as everyone knows, America used to be the global supplier of freedom.

Just ask the Native Americans.
They were introduced to freedom through modern civilization, forced migration, and smallpox.
Then came slavery, to be fair, was a strong economic foundation.
So strong, in fact, that it eventually allowed America to afford abolition.
That‚Äôs called long-term planning.

In the Philippines, freedom was imported straight from Spain via American intervention.
And then held in a storage unit for a few decades,
just to make sure the locals didn't mess it up.

America helped end World War II by introducing nuclear liberty to Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Quick, efficient, unmistakably democratic.

Later, in Latin America, freedom showed up wearing sunglasses and a CIA badge.
Democracy might‚Äôve been elected,
but America knew what the region really needed:
military coups, death squads, and just enough capitalism to keep the coffee flowing.

Iran almost fell into socialism in 1953, but America saved the day,
by reinstalling a monarchy.
Because what screams ""people's freedom"" like a royal dictatorship?

Vietnam was another close call.
Millions died, but freedom almost made it.
A valiant effort.

Iraq?
Well, who wouldn‚Äôt want to be bombed into democracy?
Freedom came, saw, and destabilized.

And Libya,
Gaddafi was a brutal man, no doubt.
Luckily, freedom came again.
Today, Libya is a thriving hub of‚Ä¶ open-air slave markets.
Progress.

America also helps maintain peace by selling weapons to nearly every region on fire.
Yemen, Israel, Saudi Arabia -
it‚Äôs all part of the grand strategy called ‚Äúregional stability.‚Äù

At home, America defends liberty through mass incarceration, police militarization,
and choosing not to give people healthcare 
because true freedom means dying with options.

Global economic freedom?
That‚Äôs the IMF‚Äôs job.
Just lend poor nations money with strings attached,
cut public services, raise debt and boom.
Freedom via austerity.

And let‚Äôs not forget the great protector of liberty: Israel 
the Middle East‚Äôs only democracy*,
(*with caveats for occupation, checkpoints, walls, and stateless millions).
America ensures this beacon stays bright, with billions in annual aid,
advanced weapons, and ironclad veto power.

So when people say,
‚ÄúAmerica has changed. It doesn‚Äôt stand for freedom anymore,‚Äù
you have to wonder...

Did it change?
Or did we just stop believing the story?

Because the story never changed.
Only the mask got tired.

Now that the mask has slipped.
We have a choice:
Keep pretending -
or start rebuilding something real

This happened two months ago on my way to a new job in northern Oregon. I‚Äôd been hired at a small logistics firm, mostly remote work, but they wanted me to come in for onboarding. I decided to drive cross-country instead of flying; it felt like a fresh start.

That night, it was close to 1 AM, and I was somewhere deep in eastern Washington. I'd been driving for nearly ten hours straight. The gas stations had gotten sparse, and the road signs were barely readable through the fog and drizzle that started around midnight.

That‚Äôs when I saw a small green sign that read:

‚ÄúElber‚Äôs Hollow ‚Äì 3 miles‚Äù

Never heard of it. But I was dead tired and my eyes were doing that thing where everything doubles for a second before snapping back into focus. I told myself I‚Äôd just stop for the night. Grab a few hours of sleep in the car if nothing else.

I took the exit.

The road into Elber‚Äôs Hollow was narrow, lined with tall pines that swayed like they were whispering to each other. The fog thickened, but the town appeared suddenly like someone had dropped it right into the forest. Just a small main street, maybe six or seven buildings. Not a single car. Not a sound.

But it was beautiful, in a weird postcard kind of way. Old brick storefronts, flowers hanging in baskets, a church steeple just visible in the distance. It looked like it belonged in a snow globe perfect, preserved, and absolutely still.

The only light came from a place called ‚ÄúThe Elber Inn.‚Äù

I pulled in front, cut the engine, and stepped out. The air smelled like pine and rust. My boots echoed on the wet pavement as I walked inside.

The lobby was dimly lit, quiet. Wood-paneled walls. A fireplace burning low. In front of it, a man sat in an armchair watching an old black-and-white television. The glow flickered across his face, but he didn‚Äôt look up.

He had long fingers, draped over the sides of the chair like they were too heavy. Pale skin. Thin lips. Motionless.

I cleared my throat. ‚ÄúHey, uh, do you have a room available?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt turn to me. His eyes were fixed on the TV. Then he spoke.

‚ÄúYou drove in alone.‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt a question.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúJust needed to rest. Storm‚Äôs picking up.‚Äù

Still no movement. Then, finally, he shifted. Turned just his head, very slowly, and looked at me.

His eyes were gray; no whites, no color. Just‚Ä¶ washed out. I remember that vividly.

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt stay too long,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey wake up when it‚Äôs quiet.‚Äù

I tried to laugh, awkwardly. ‚ÄúYou mean like, raccoons or something?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt smile.

Behind him was a wooden key board. Eight keys, only one missing. He gestured toward it.
‚ÄúRoom Six. Take it.‚Äù

I hesitated. ‚ÄúDo I need to‚Ä¶ sign anything?‚Äù

His head turned back to the TV.

‚ÄúNo one else signs in anymore.‚Äù

The room was‚Ä¶ normal, if a little old. Twin bed, quilt with a faded pattern, nightstand with a lamp that flickered when I turned it on. The radiator clanked now and then like something inside was trying to get out. But I was exhausted, and honestly? I didn‚Äôt care.

I locked the door. Put the key on the nightstand. Collapsed onto the bed fully dressed.

I don‚Äôt know how long I was asleep, but I woke up to silence.

Not just quiet absence. No wind. No radiator. No TV static. Even my phone had lost service.

I threw on my jacket and stepped into the hallway.

The fire in the lobby was out. The chair was empty. The TV was off, screen reflecting only my own pale face. The key for Room 6 was back on the board.

I checked outside.

The fog had thickened to a wall, but I could still see the buildings. Every light in every window had gone dark. No footprints. No vehicles. It felt like the town had decided to die while I was sleeping.

I walked down the street, calling out a few times. Nothing.

Then I heard it.

A low mechanical noise, like an old power tool winding up. It came from a garage on the far end of town. One yellow bulb swung over the open door, barely cutting through the fog.

I should‚Äôve turned back. But I walked toward it.

The closer I got, the more I noticed something strange. The sound wasn‚Äôt mechanical it was wet. A dragging, slithering sound. Like a thick rope pulled across a soaked floor.

The bulb above the garage blinked as I stepped in.

There was a workbench. Old tires. Oil stains. And‚Ä¶ a shape.

It rose slowly from the far corner, unfolding like it had too many joints. At first I thought it was a bundle of hoses. Then it moved.

Long, twitching appendages, some covered in black scales, others raw and pink like exposed muscle. It shifted again and I saw a head elongated, reptilian. Four eye sockets, all empty, all black. Its mouth opened slightly and inside were rows of teeth like broken glass.

I couldn‚Äôt move. I was completely frozen my body, my breath, even my thoughts felt like they‚Äôd been paralyzed.

Then it spoke.

But not aloud. The voice echoed inside my head.

A woman‚Äôs voice. Warm. Gentle. Wrong.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not one of them.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you trespassed.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve seen too much.‚Äù

Tears rolled down my face. I don‚Äôt know why. It wasn‚Äôt just fear; it was like it was inside me, unspooling memories I didn‚Äôt even know I had.

I thought that was it. I thought I would die there, with my legs locked in place and my mind torn apart by this‚Ä¶ thing.

And then‚Äî

A car horn. Far off. Muffled by the fog. Real.

The tension snapped like a rubber band.

The creature hissed, its tentacles recoiling in a sharp, sickening snap. I stumbled back, then turned and ran barely seeing, just running. Through the street, past the inn, toward my car. My hands were shaking so bad I dropped the keys twice.

But I got in. I started the engine.

And I didn‚Äôt look back.

I drove for four straight hours. Didn‚Äôt stop until I saw an open diner just past Spokane. I must‚Äôve looked half insane when I walked in. Mud on my jeans, bleeding from one palm, shaking like I‚Äôd been pulled out of a freezer.

The waitress poured me coffee and didn‚Äôt ask questions.

I never found Elber‚Äôs Hollow on a map again. Even retracing my route with GPS, there‚Äôs no sign of the turn-off, no mention of a town by that name. Nothing.

But I know what I saw. I know what I felt.

And sometimes, late at night, I swear I still hear that voice in my head. Soft. Sweet. Inviting.

If you‚Äôre ever on Highway 16 and you see a sign for Elber‚Äôs Hollow‚Ä¶

Don‚Äôt stop.

Don‚Äôt look for it.

And if something speaks in your head that sounds like a memory, run.

It‚Äôs not you thinking.

She‚Äôs still looking.

We now run a small coffee shop together.,"About three years ago, I missed a flight home for the first time in my life. Total chaos. My phone died, the gate changed, I was stuck in the wrong terminal eating a $9 sandwich, and by the time I realized, my plane was somewhere over Ohio. I just stood there at the gate, holding my cold sandwich, trying not to cry in public. I failed.

So there I am, sitting on the floor like a 2000s indie movie protagonist, trying to figure out what to do next, when a guy sits down next to me. Doesn‚Äôt say anything for a while. Then he hands me a phone charger and says, *‚ÄúYou look like you‚Äôre one bad playlist away from losing it.‚Äù*

I laugh. A little. I thank him. He asks what happened. I tell him the sandwich betrayal story first. Then the rest. He nods like he totally gets it. Then says:

*‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm stuck here too. Wanna make bad decisions and go find the worst coffee in this airport?‚Äù*

We wandered the terminal. Talked about the worst movies we‚Äôve ever cried to. Tried airport espresso that tasted like wet cardboard. Shared playlists. Played 20 Questions. I told him I used to want to open a bookstore caf√©. He told me he once tried to run a bagel cart but set off the fire alarm on day two. By the time our rescheduled flights were boarding, we were already texting.

Over the next few months, we stayed in touch. First it was jokes. Then playlists. Then calls. Then visits. Then‚Ä¶ love.

We now live in a quiet town in upstate New York. Last year, we opened our own tiny caf√©-bookshop. There‚Äôs a sign above the counter that says:  
‚ÄúMissed Flights & Burnt Coffee: Est. 2023.‚Äù  
People think it‚Äôs a joke. It‚Äôs not.

We serve tea as an inside joke. But our coffee? Legendary. We kept the first burnt phone charger framed in the back office.

He still says, *‚ÄúYou looked like a disaster when we met.‚Äù*

Overthinking every step, and excessively talking led to her not moving fwd with us. Shit happens... How to improve? Dating is frustrating!

Want to get a woman's opinion as well here ...

1st date - week 1
I initiated drinks, went to 2 bars and called it a night. I paid for drinks, I always pay on first dates, my rule of thumb. Was raised too nice. She gave positive feedback after!

2nd date - week 2
I texted and initiated, she was excited, suggested a walk n coffee, and I said mini golf. Ended up doing both. I paid for mini golf, she never brought up paying but thanked me for it. She bought hot chocolate for us in return. She stated she had fun and I said let's do this again and she was on board.

3rd date - (wk 3)
Finally did dinner n drinks. I initiated again, she never texts till I do. Her texts are super short, but she does respond quickly when I plan something.

At dinner she stated she got laid off and obviously I picked up the check, she did want to split it. Suggested she could pay for drinks after. we never kissed yet and I was nervous, so I suggested casually we should make out later, she was like yeah we should. She is not flirty, pretty hard to read, no subtle touching either from her. I have initiated contact a few times but not too receptive. 

I got buzzed and talkative for once (otherwise she talks more) after the first bar. We tried to go bar hopping and sadly 2 of them had cover charge which was not expected, not much crowds. Went to a bar with no cover, and she walked out a minute later, she is picky and indecisive at times. Since other bars were charging, I refused to pay and she got turned off and said let's call it's a night. I was a bit taken back because we both were trying to actually have fun and I wanted to distract her from her work situation. She called herself an Uber, wasn't talkative, we kissed goodnight and that was it. 

I texted her today, 2 days after, asking if she is up for hanging out again, and she declined saying she needs time to heal and focus on herself so she is taking a step back from dating and stuff. Yes I know what this means. 


TLDR - after 2 fun dates, 3rd date didn't go as well, and she cut it off after I asked her out again. I recall sharing lots of stories and talking more on the 3rd date cuz I was buzzed and with ADHD I blabber more than usual. When bar hoping I refused to pay $10 or $20 cover for bars, which turned her off and she called it a night. She got laid off before our 3rd date and declined to go out again saying she needs time to heal and focus on herself, instead of dating. In other words ""It's not you, it's me""

The chill breeze carries all the memories of my childhood days. After got down from a bus I am still wondering what made me stand on that road under that tree! It might be the fast falling rain drops or her. Yes, it was her that funny looking young lady in blue t-shirt with perfectly fitted jeans, standing there under a big tree which bearing beautiful flowers. I have never seen her before, she wasn‚Äôt an extraordinary but exceptional. Her playful eyes twinkling with each drops of rain drop it catches on its gaze. Her dancing gestures moving along with the sound of rain water hitting the ground. It wasn‚Äôt just the two of us standing under the tree but some school kids and their parents too sheltered under that tree. What caught my attention towards her was her kind and friendly act of holding her umbrella above a little girl despite of her, being drenched. I know I am getting late to go but something was telling me to go and talk to her. It was not a common thing here that, you can directly approach and talk to any random girl. However, I didn‚Äôt want to go at least appreciating her kindness.
I said ‚Äúhi‚Äù and I was shocked to hear my own voice and guts.
She responded with a questioning smile ‚Äúyes‚Äù.
She responded to me my inner-boy dancing and summersaulting, this wasn‚Äôt a dream even if so god I didn‚Äôt want that to end at any cost. She was looking at my stupid face with enquiry look, her perfectly curved brows was telling me ‚ÄúI bet you, you would never see anything like me before‚Äù. It was so hard for me to focus while her face express lots of things on one go. I wanted to run away from there I didn‚Äôt want her to take me as some flirt or jerks loitering on the road to hit a beautiful girl on their way to somewhere. So I asked her this, ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam could you guide me towards the nearly IT Park, I have an interview there.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt say it was a relief or she saw my idiotic face, she was smiling wide. She told me that I have to go straight then take left, after gave the direction she was looking at me like scanning, then only I noticed that all the way I was drenched like a chick even though I had umbrella in my hand but unopened all the while I was standing under the rain and observing her. I supposed to admit that she must have cast a spell over me that I have never felt like this much mesmerized after seeing someone. Her brow slightly raised above, I confessed the truth that I was observing her from the very moment of we hopped down from a same bus and her gesture of kindness and all. Even that wasn‚Äôt my type, out of all the fear I confessed that she was amazing. She listened all my stupid confession patiently, but she started to give away the sign of irritation when I asked her for a coffee. She asked me ‚Äúaren‚Äôt you late to the interview?‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt just a question but a sign that she caught me red-handed there was no way of keep going with the lie so I told her, ‚Äúsorry I am not here for an interview but I am an employee of that company, after seeing you I don‚Äôt know what happened to me but, I am sure I don‚Äôt want to miss you. Coffee, please?‚Äù She just turned away from me and started to walk after few steps she turned towards me, a beautiful smile appeared on her face. I walked towards her each step weighed me tons tied on my leg. I was nervous as I was about to hear my board exam result. She said ‚Äúis this how you always do whenever you come across any female?‚Äù I was hurt, it was hurting like a piercing knife but, she was correct I supposed to be straight forward instead of being this much quire. What would be she thinking about me? When I was about to apologies, she smiled at me and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm impressed‚Äù.",6,1750141694.0,OmniscientReader,3,0.88,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. 

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. 

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. 

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. Nicotine is what‚Äôs called a vasoconstrictor, while nicotine itself is not a carcinogen, it can temporarily narrow your blood vessels, veins, and make them smaller while the nicotine is in your system. The nicotine can also raise your heart's pulse rate. 

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. 

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. 

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what‚Äôs called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. 

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead.

‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. 

‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. 

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. 

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

I‚Äôm a 22-year-old guy based in London, looking to build real, long-term friendships ‚Äî the kind that ideally involves meeting up in person eventually. I find it hard to build genuine bonds without shared experiences beyond a screen.

Who I‚Äôm hoping to connect with:

Based in the UK (even better if you‚Äôre in London or nearby)

Open to eventually meeting in person ‚Äî for coffee, gigs, or just to hang out


A bit about me:

‚öΩ Football fan ‚Äî I play weekly

ü§ò Big into rock & metal ‚Äî always up for gigs (would be great to have people to go with!)

üéÆ Gamer ‚Äî mostly into single-player games across genres

üé¨ Into Marvel and all things nerdy

üèéÔ∏è Love go-karting and theme parks (always looking for fellow thrill seekers)

1ldfw9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/glasgow/comments/1ldfw9f/southside_coffee_shops_not_open_before_9am/,Southside Coffee Shops Not Open Before 9am???,"I‚Äôve lived in southside for almost two years now. I work Monday to Friday, usual 9-5. 

What I can‚Äôt seem to grasp is, with the plethora  of coffee shops popping up here, why does a single one of them never open before 9am? I‚Äôve lived in other parts of the city and almost everywhere else has a decent coffee shop open at a normal time. I‚Äôve also worked in plenty coffee shops when I was a student and it almost seems idiotic from a business point of view to not open during what I would‚Äôve considered ‚Äúpeak times‚Äù (7/8am). 

It‚Äôs really frustrating as a commuter because with the amount of people that flood that train at Queens Park, I know for a fact coffee shops round here would make a killing in the morning.

Anyway, rant over - just seems really stupid to me, especially from certain business that moan about no one buying their coffee when they don‚Äôt open during commuting hours and are right next to a train station :))  ",44,1750141105.0,glasgow,47,0.86,False
