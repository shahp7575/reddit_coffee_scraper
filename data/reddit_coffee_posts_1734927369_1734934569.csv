Without giving out personal details also to not risk exposure. Ive had a crush on this woman since the day that we connected. My soul lights up Everytime she speaks. Just her smile gets me blushing. I haven't made it obvious that I like her and honestly don't know if I will at all ever. I did ask her to have coffee sometimes and she said yes to that and had kinda been saying very nice and sweet things to me lately and even gave me a hug and something else which I will not expose though but meant the world to me. I still can't tell if she is just being nice or showing interest in me like I to her. Im afraid of the rejection from this one for sure. Please anyone who responds please no hateful or mean comments. I'm not here for that. I really do actually like this woman on a soul level which hasn't happened since my ex wife. Id really like genuine thoughts.

We went for a coffee date, I showed up early and she showed up 5 minutes late (no big deal) but I had already gotten my coffee and was sitting at the table. We exchanged niceties and introductions before she went to grab a cup of coffee. 

On her way to the counter, she whipped out her phone and thought she was texting her friend and said

""(friend name), He's so ugly"" 

""He isn't even buying my coffee"" 

""I just want to Leave"" 

I stood up, tapped her on her shoulder, and said I had to leave, 

objectively it's pretty hilarious, like something out of a movie, but is that normal? Do people often text friends during dates? that seems quite disrespectful. 

I'm not a catfish, all my photos are current, but even when I've been on dates where I know quickly that I don't find them attractive I always still talk to and have a great conversation because it's fun getting to know people even if you don't believe there is anything. 

  
Additionally, who pays for coffee on a first date? 

I've always believed that if we arrived together from a walk, met in the parking lot, or by coincidence in the lineup you offered to pay or pay. But if you are already sitting down and they are late, logistically why would I get up and pay for your coffee? Like it's a three-dollar coffee?

1hkhi89,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1hkhi89/can_i_sue_my_old_job/,Can i sue my old job?,"Hi Reddit. I (23) got fired from my job as a cook at a higher rating hotel in the downtown Sacramento CA area. I started in May 2023 as a dishwasher and ended as a prep cook when I got fired in December 2024. I don't know how much relevance this has but I'm including it.

In the almost 2 years I worked here, I have witnessed a lot of things that could be plausible lawsuits, some of which happened to me and I was just wondering if it would be possible to build a case and win against them. I will include a list of things that I either have proof of or can get the proof of if I decide to seek legal action.

1. Almost a year ago, maybe a little less than a year, I had a pretty severe work injury that left a faint scar on my right arm, faint in the winter but more noticeable in the summer. I was rushed by my chefs (think of those as the kitchen management) to hurry up and make the family/break room food. I was making some kind of pasta and since they were rushing me, I decided to use the hot water function in the coffee maker (for those who don't know, that water can get around 212-230 degrees). Due to everyone rushing me, I also forgot a towel to carry the hot pot of water to the stove to finish boiling, which ended with me spilling said par-boiling water all down my arm. Rather than trying to help or even see if I was okay, the chef on duty (let's call her Heather) watched me spill it all over myself and proceeded to yell at me, and I quote ""Great. Now we have a mess to clean up. Fucking- someone get a dishwasher to mop up the water, i dont have time for this."" As I'm crying and clutching my arm. When I asked for a break, she denied it saying I could ""work through the pain"". She didn't even get me an incident report until one of my co workers yelled at upper management for a form.

When I finally got a break, I decided to just chill in the break room after filling out the forms. Someone asked me what happened, and I just explained everything, adding in what she did and said because I felt it was relevant, and because I was blatantly upset. I guess Heather was in the hallway next to the break room and heard me say that and decided I was ""talking shit"" about her and took it offensively. When I was finally done with my shift, as I was heading out of the kitchen to clock out, Heather stopped me and, in front of everyone in the kitchen, yelled at me and degraded me. Said how I had no right to ""shit talk"" about her and lie about the situation. Added in how she went to HR and reported me for, what i'm assuming because she didn't say what she reported me for, bullying or something. As well as ""Also, I filled out my incident report for being a witness, so good luck with that. Now get the fuck out of my kitchen."" I feel like I should reiterate that this was all in front of like 8-10 other cooks and room servers, rather than said in an office, in private.

2. I should also explain that I felt targeted by Heather ever since she got hired as a sous chef. And this next story should explain why. I worked here for almost 2 years, and didn't get my first disciplinary write up until around my year and 2 months (around the time heather started) and within about a month, I had around 2 verbal warnings and 3 written write ups. This story will go over one of those write ups.

In this kitchen, you were responsible for choosing a spot on one of the tables and setting up your ""station"" for your shift, as well as keeping it clean and putting everything away before taking any kind of break or clocking out. Now, i will say this, I'm not the best at keeping my areas clean, but i also didn't let it get that bad, I also had the tendency to forget to clean up everything before leaving for bathroom breaks or meal breaks. That being said, I was getting better at cleaning when this write up occured. It was right before i clocked out and Heather was getting mad at me and yelling about needing to leave on time. I hadn't cleaned up everything yet but after she yelled at me to leave, I decided to let another sous chef know (let's call him Zach) that I had to leave, and she was yelling at me and that I didn't have time to clean my station 100%. Zach told me it was fine and that he'll have someone else clean up after me and to go home for the day. I told him thanks and left. Fast forward a few days later and Zach tells me to go to the office where Heather was waiting for us. They told me i was getting written up for not cleaning up before i left a few days prior. When I tried to explain that I only didn't clean because zach told me it was okay because heather was yelling at me, they didn't let me talk. Told me I should've gotten better with time management and cleaned before it was to the point of being yelled at to leave. I ended up not signing that write up, even though Heather was peer pressuring me and saying I HAD to sign  it so they could put it in my files. I ended up just walking out and finishing my shift that day.

3. Remember how I said I had 3 write ups within a month or so? Well, I talked about one of them, let's talk about the other one that I believe was wrongful, and eventually led to my termination (my termination was due to getting my last write up, so if these 2 write ups didn't happen, I wouldn't have been fired).

This hotel operated under the general manager (let's call her Jackie). I had never interacted with Jackie, but I guess she saw me go up to the 3rd floor kitchen (this hotel had a main kitchen that dealt with in room dining services and banquet prep on the second floor and a restaurant and lounge on the third floor) to wish someone a happy birthday on my break. I am gonna preface by saying i had permission to keep one earbud in my ear due to mental reasons (adhd and oher neurodivergent things that caused me to get easily distracted and overwhelmed if there's too much noise and having one earbud in helped deafen the noise when it gets too bad). Well, she saw me coming back from that one third floor kitchen, and I was talking to myself (something I tend to do if I'm upset or anxious) and assumed I was on the phone. Instead of talking to me directly, she had a write up sent to the chefs for me talking on the phone. When I tried disputing it, the executive chef (let's call him Josh) straight up told me ""Well, I can't say my boss is lying so just sign it and get back to work"" and wouldn't let me say anything else. I tried getting a hold of Jackie, but right after that happened, she went on a personal leave of absence and said that the assistant manager and HR would run the place and all concerns can go to them, so I didn't even try talking to her.

4. Now here comes the reason I was fired, which I feel was also a wrongful write up/termination. I was the overnight cook for in room dining services (we were 24 hour room service) and one of my responsibilities was cooking employee meals during overnight. How we did those meals was this: we had tickets we gave to the housekeeping, engineering and front desk managers, who then signed them for their respective workers and then those workers filled the rest of the slip out and gave it to either me or the in room dining server. Once the server had the ticket, they would ring it in and print out a receipt before stapling the receipt and meal ticket together to prove it was an employee's overnight meal. Now the problem lies with the server. The main server I worked with would sometimes not ring in the tickets after they were given the slip of paper and would do it around 3:30-4 am. When I was terminated, they mentioned having the ticket times and that those times did not match when I would make food, because again, the server wouldn't ring in the tickets at the correct time, and because of that, it was considered ""making food without a corresponding ticket"". The thing is I had tickets, the server just didn't ring them in at the right time. I tried explaining that and Heather would not let me speak whatsoever. She never even gave me termination paperwork to give to  my caseworker to get unemployment. She gave me information about unemployment and instructions on how to change my address in case I needed to do so before telling me to get out.

Some extra bits of information in case it's relevant. Heather was promoted to Executive sous chef a few months prior to me being fired and got more and more aggressive. She also would get mad and bully and be borderline racist towards the non-English speakers in the kitchen. I had witnessed her yelling at one of them for ""being stupid and blind"" when she couldn't find something, after sending her in the wrong direction to find it. She also had the tendency to tell you to do something and then when you do it, get mad at you for doing it and denying she ever told you to do it in the first place (ie: i got in trouble for steaming brussel sprouts for the break room food and when i said she told me to do it, she laughed and denied it. Even said i was making up stories against her when i gave the word for word explanation of her telling me to do it). She is the main reason we have such a high quitting rate in the kitchen, and I'm not exaggerating.

  
One more thing I feel is worth mentioning is the fact that management doesn't look at the cameras themselves. They have the engineering team do it, even though I believe termination reasons are supposed to be kept between management and the staff that's being investigated.

1hkhgtx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hkhgtx,"Advice on dressing for my new unique proportions? Brands, layers, cuts, tailoring? During my wife’s pregnancy, I (M31) gained 130lbs in 9+ months, all in my belly—now stuck with a 67” gut, looking overdue with quadruplets. Doctors say it’s the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome they’ve ever seen. ","Over the past 9+ months, I’ve experienced a truly surreal transformation due to an extreme case of Couvade Syndrome, or “sympathetic pregnancy.” I (M31) have gained 130 pounds—all in my belly—during my wife’s pregnancy, leaving me with a 67-inch waistline and a silhouette that looks more overdue with quadruplets than any standard body type. While I’ve come to terms with the medical side of this condition, one of the most frustrating aspects of my transformation has been figuring out how to dress myself with any sense of style, comfort, or dignity.

My body has outgrown nearly every piece of clothing I own, and I’m at a loss for what to wear. Button-up shirts pull so tight that they gape open, and even the largest sizes I’ve tried seem to ride up over my belly whenever I move. Pants are just as difficult—they constantly dig into the underside of my belly or refuse to stay up without a belt, which only emphasizes how far my stomach pushes out. Most of the time, I feel like I’m one wardrobe malfunction away from total embarrassment, and it’s only added to the already overwhelming stares and comments I get in public.

I’m hoping this community can offer some guidance on how to dress for my unique proportions. Are there certain brands or cuts that might better accommodate a large, round belly? Should I prioritize oversized fits, stretchy materials, or specific types of tailoring? I’d also love tips on colors or layering techniques to downplay the size of my belly and create a more balanced look. Any advice on how to make my wardrobe functional, flattering, and comfortable would be incredibly appreciated.

———————————————————————

For context, I’ll include the details of my transformation and condition below. Feel free to AMA if you’re curious—thanks so much for your help:

I never thought I’d be writing this, but after what’s happened to my body over the past 9+ months, I feel like I’m living in a surreal medical case study. My wife and I (both 31) are expecting our first children—twins!—and her pregnancy has been going as smoothly as possible. But for me, things took a very bizarre turn. Early in her pregnancy, I began experiencing symptoms of what’s called Couvade Syndrome, or “sympathetic pregnancy,” where men mimic some of their partner’s pregnancy symptoms. At first, it was funny—me complaining about morning nausea and intense cravings while my wife teased me for being dramatic. But as the weeks went on, the symptoms became extreme.

[HERE](https://imgur.com/a/1XUx2qQ) are some photos and videos of me before versus me now in the last couple months of this transformation. 

Within 9+ months, I’ve gained over 130 pounds, and it’s all gone to my belly.  Doctors have tested me for every possible condition—Cushing’s syndrome, hypothyroidism, ascites, insulin resistance, and a laundry list of rare disorders. They ran metabolic panels, hormone tests, and even MRIs to rule out anything that could explain this transformation. Everything came back normal. After countless appointments with endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, and dietitians, the consensus is unanimous: this is the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome they’ve ever seen. My body has gone into a hyper-sympathetic state, mimicking my wife’s pregnancy so intensely that I now look more pregnant than she does.

Here’s the wildest part: my belly has grown to an unbelievable 67+ inches in circumference. It’s perfectly round, heavy, and tight—so much so that doctors have compared it to an overdue pregnancy with triplets or even quadruplets. I’ve been experiencing cravings, hormonal changes, and even bizarre moments of arousal that have made this entire experience surreal and difficult to process.

The public’s stares reactions to me have been nothing short of overwhelming. Everywhere I go, people treat me like a walking sideshow attraction. Strangers constantly stop me on the street to ask, “When are you due?” or “Are you having twins—or is it triplets?” Sometimes, people assume I’m joking when I say I’m not pregnant or assure them that my belly is real, even, and not a costume. One particularly embarrassing encounter happened when a man followed me in his car, yelling “Hey, heifer! How’d you get so huge, fatass!” and filming me as I struggled to walk. He kept shouting out the window, “When are the babies due?” and even taunted me to run, laughing as I awkwardly waddled down the street. 

Another time, a homeless man trailed me for blocks, loudly asking, “Are you sick? What happened to you? You can still fix this. You look like you’re about to pop!” His comments drew stares from others, and the whole experience left me humiliated. Once, at a grocery store, I reached for something on a high shelf, and the movement caused my shirt to ride up, exposing my belly. A woman nearby loudly gasped and asked if I was okay, or pregnant, and when I assured her I wasn’t pregnant, she looked me up and down in disbelief before walking away, shaking her head.  Thankfully, some guys are entertained or supportive, and say things like “Damn, bro, that’s the most impressive belly I’ve ever seen. Take care of yourself. That’s crazy.”

Our small town caught wind of what was happening to me and even ran a story in the local paper. They did a photo shoot with me and my wife, documenting what they called “the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome on record.” The article focused on the medical mystery and included photos of me standing next to my wife, both of us cradling our bellies. At one point, they measured my stomach circumference on camera, which was mortifying. The reporter joked that I looked more overdue than my wife, and the whole experience left me red-faced, especially when people in town started recognizing me from the article and stopping me to ask questions.

Family and friends have been equally baffled. My wife’s parents were initially concerned and suggested I get immediate medical attention, while my own family didn’t believe it at first and thought I was exaggerating. Now, it’s become a mix of humor and genuine concern. Even at work, my coworkers started a playful due date countdown for me, marking it on the office calendar alongside my wife’s.

Despite the jokes, I feel terrible that my transformation has overshadowed my wife’s pregnancy. What should have been a time focused on her and the excitement of our twins has turned into a community spectacle about my bizarre condition. She’s been incredibly supportive and laughs it off, joking that I’m taking some of the heat off her by becoming the bigger attraction. But I can’t help feeling guilty—this was supposed to be her moment, and instead, I’m the one everyone’s talking about.

Meanwhile, I’ve struggled to maintain a sense of normalcy. My shirts don’t fit anymore, riding up over my belly and exposing the lower half every time I move. I’ve tried buying larger sizes, but even those don’t last long before I outgrow them. Just the other day, I bent down to tie my shoe at work, and the strain caused a button to pop off my shirt, shooting across the office like a missile. Everyone heard it, and I had to awkwardly laugh it off while turning red. Another time, I stretched to grab something at a 711, and the seam of my shirt tore open right down the side, leaving me scrambling to cover myself. My pants aren’t any better—they’re so tight under the curve of my gut that I’ve split the seams more times than I care to admit.

At work, I’m required to wear a uniform—a button-up shirt, no less—and squeezing into it has become a nightmare. The buttons pull so tight that I’m sure they’ll pop, and they often do—sometimes in front of coworkers or even clients, which is humiliating. I’ve started bringing safety pins to hold my shirts together in emergencies, but even those can barely contain the strain. Each week, I’m outgrowing something else, to the point where I’m running out of options entirely.

Getting dressed in the morning has become a daily battle. Pulling my pants up under the massive curve of my belly feels like trying to fit into a sausage casing. The waistband digs into me so tightly that it makes my gut stick out even more, exaggerating its size and making me look even more absurdly pregnant. My belt creaks and groans whenever I sit down, and I constantly worry it’s going to snap. Even sitting in a chair has become a spectacle; I have to ease myself down slowly to avoid bursting buttons or causing the furniture to creak under my weight.

Movement is an entirely different challenge. I can barely bend over to tie my shoes without my belly pressing hard against my thighs, forcing me to hold my breath just to reach the laces. I’ve started wearing slip-ons to avoid the embarrassment. Getting in and out of my car is another ordeal—it feels like I’m wedging myself into a tight space, my belly brushing against the steering wheel no matter how far back I push the seat. Walking down the street, my belly bounces and jiggles with every step, drawing stares from passersby. Sometimes, I even catch people filming me.

Everyday tasks that used to be simple now feel monumental, and I’ve stopped pretending I can blend in. Despite my best efforts to maintain normalcy, my transformation has made me impossible to ignore.

Doctors have been fascinated by my condition, describing me as a medical anomaly. They’ve even suggested publishing my case in a medical journal, as they’ve never seen anything like it. While I understand their excitement from a scientific perspective, it’s hard not to feel like a sideshow. I’ve been poked, prodded, and measured so many times that I’ve lost count.

As for other symptoms/side effects, there’s a lot more to this experience than just the abdominal growth. Early on, we thought it was kind of adorable how in sync my wife and I were during her pregnancy. I’d wake up nauseous when she did, I’d have random cravings, and we joked about how empathetic I was being when I’d have morning sickness. But as things progressed, it became clear this wasn’t just harmless sympathy symptoms. My body’s hormonal changes went into overdrive. Alongside the weight gain, I’ve dealt with intense mood swings, exhaustion, and an unsettling sensitivity to smells. Even little things, like the scent of strong coffee, can send me running for fresh air.  The exhaustion hasn’t helped with me also not being very active during this time. 

Unlike my wife, I’m not growing two babies, so everything I eat is turning directly into fat, and unfortunately, it’s all going straight to my belly. The uncontrollable cravings have been a big part of this. I naturally eat more than her as it is, but the hormonal changes I’ve been experiencing—like elevated prolactin and cortisol levels—have completely derailed any sense of self-control. It’s as if my body is craving the transformation itself. There have been times I’ve gone on insane binges, eating until I physically couldn’t anymore… Even when I wanted to stop, it felt impossible, I was still hungry, like my body was demanding more fuel to keep growing.

Doctors think my body is in a kind of “hyper-storage mode,” where every calorie is being stored as fat, specifically in my abdomen, almost as if it’s mimicking a pregnancy. Some specialists believe my fat cells in this area might have become overly sensitive to insulin, leading to the rapid, disproportionate fat accumulation. Others suggest that elevated prolactin levels, typically associated with lactation and maternal behaviors, might be affecting how my body stores fat and retains fluid. Combined with some fluid retention in my belly, it’s created this bizarre, ballooning effect that feels completely out of my control. It’s crazy to outgrow a shirt in a matter of a couple weeks. 

One of the more difficult—and frankly embarrassing—symptoms has been this bizarre hormonal arousal.  Sorry if it is TMI to share all of this, but it’s such a large part of the psychological side effects I’ve been dealing with that it would be hard not to include it. My doctors have explained that the surges of prolactin, cortisol, and other pregnancy-related hormones in my system seem to be “confusing” my body, tricking it into thinking this transformation is something I’m meant to desire or enjoy. It’s almost as though my body is trying to gaslight me into embracing the changes so it can continue expanding. They’ve told me that this is likely part of a feedback loop—my body experiences embarrassment or awkwardness from how big I’ve gotten and the trouble I have maneuvering or drawing attention, and that stress triggers a hormonal response that leads to an unexpected surge of arousal. That sensation then clouds my judgment, making me crave situations where I feel even more self-conscious, which leads to choices—like overeating or not avoiding tight clothes—that exacerbate the growth.

This feedback loop is one of the hardest aspects to navigate. It’s created a cycle where I feel like I’m feeding into my own situation, literally and figuratively. The arousal itself feels like my body’s way of pushing me to keep going, even though I logically don’t want to get bigger or draw more attention. And yet, I’ve found myself leaning into these situations, almost unconsciously seeking out moments that leave me even more embarrassed or humiliated. It’s such a strange and difficult headspace to be in because I know it’s my hormones playing tricks on me, but in the moment, it’s hard to fight against. The doctors are optimistic that these reactions should subside once my wife gives birth and my hormones stabilize, but until then, I’m doing my best to stay mindful and not let this cycle get even more out of control.

At the end of the day, I’m still at a loss. My body feels alien to me, and every day brings new challenges. I’ve started wondering if this condition will reverse after my wife gives birth—or if this is something I’ll be living with for the rest of my life.

Tropical just glows in any type of light, it's even better in person if thats possible to believe. And the deep purple base with bright red shimmer of Doom is so moody and dramatic, they're  both  exactly like their swatch photos. 

Mojo is exactly as beautiful as the swatch photos too, I'm super excited to try it velvetized. Eccentric is pretty but doesn't have much of the color shifts that it has in the bottle/photos, it's basically just a shimmery purple, you can barely see the green, at least on me. (To be fair, it's been cloudy, maybe it shows up in the sun?)

He Loves Me Not looks like a coffee brown most of the time, the red shimmer only shows in bright light. It's pretty but def more subtle than I expected.

So, thoda context, I am an aspiring law student, who worked his ass off for a recent entrance exam of ours. Unfortunately the conducting body decided to screw us students over, and not take responsibility for their mistakes, this lead to me and countless others not getting an opportunity to enroll into their dream colleges since we were unable to score enough for them.


Now, this exam happened in the first week of december and 2 days back, My father tells me that I won’t be successful, because he doesn’t see skills of a lawyer in me???? Like, I haven’t even started my journey yet?? Wdym??? Now this exam and his comments really really affected me and I was unable to give my math prelims in my college. I was awake from 3:00 today trying to study but was unable to.


And keep in mind, I slept at 1:00. Nahi ho paaya lekin, kya karu? Now I was in my room sleeping, and I hear my mother outside telling my father ki voh, i.e. “me” toh bohot bada bol bacchan hai, kuch ukhaad nahi paayega zindagi mein. And this isn’t the first time they have done something like this. My mother also told me once, ki beta dhyaan rakhna, vakeel ban ne nikal rahe ho, munshi(clerk) banke vaapis mat aana.

There is also this girl that I liked in my classes, who I thought was a good friend of mine. So last sunday, I asked her to come try a new coffee flavour with me(We both are coffee enthusiasts and havw gone thrice before) and guess what, I was left on delivered for a bloody week, a full week!!! Then she has the audacity to message me yesterday, asking how life has been? Like, it hasn’t been good bruh!
Then I confronted her about this message and what she does is, tells me that she never got it. The only explanation I could reach was, she got the mesaage, deleted it and then sent me a screenshot of our chat.


I am very tired of this guys, and am sorry thoda zyaada likh diya, but just wanted to rant and have no one. Just wanted to get things off my mind.

Been using this entry level espresso set up for a few months now and really loving it so far.  This has been my experience so far:

Pros of this grinder:

-extremely small footprint for my limited counter top space
-LOW noise (even during those quiet early morning hours)
-Zero retention (bellow and knocker works quite well)
-Stepless adjustment
-Super affordable (dirt ""cheap"" open box prices)
-although not advertised as an espresso grinder, it can grind fine enough to clog my Bambino.  And I obviously daily it for my espresso beans (light/medium roasts)

Cons:
-looks like a microscope

Would love to hear any other owner's experiences and also if anyone has done any upgrades to their burrs?

So I notice I have a tendency to obsess over my mistakes, especially if it’s over something I care deeply about.

So for example, I recently had a meeting to see a friend I really like and care about, who I hadn’t seen in a long time and no longer live close to.

Unfortunately I was 43 minutes late. Originally I was only supposed to treat them to lunch (which I had pre prepared), but to apologize I also treated them and their significant other to coffee at a nice shop and dinner at a local cafe.

Personally I think they forgave me, but it’s been 2 days and I’m still obsessing over it.

I feel like I have a perfectionist streak and tend to want things to be a certain way and have a hard time accepting deviations.

It was my first job out of university, and I has worked for a year. The job itself was okay, albeit pretty high stress for me that had no previous experience in the field or system we developed. What made it unbearable was my boss. I very rarely have a problem with people, bosses included, and have both before and since always like my managers and have been appreciated by them. This guy however… he fucked me up for a while afterwards, as to where I got a physical reaction when my new boss (who never ever behaved badly) at new company called because I was so anxious about what I’d done wrong this time. He was manipulative, rude, played favorites and a bad teacher. This was his first time being a manager and I think he thought he needed to prove himself and has no clue how to be a leader. I’m sharing all this because I want to set the stage of how awful the work climate was, and how little respect he had for for some of us.    

Christmas time rolls around and we draw names out of a hat. I get one of my new female colleagues that I like - sweet. The limit is around 15-20$. It was optional I believe, but everyone was excited to do something that even resembled team building. There was some sharing of who got who - some wanted tips on what to buy. One of my fairly new coworkers got our boss. He shares with me that he’s pretty happy about his idea and was waiting for it to arrive from where he bought it online.    

Friday afternoon a week before Christmas comes around and we all sit down to have coffee and exchange gifts. I got a super cute plush toy of my favorite dog breed. I gave earrings. Everyone got nice stuff. People had made an effort, and it showed!   
My boss opens gift. And his face turns sour. It’s a tiny beanie with the company logo on. He pulls it up and holds it up; “what is this? I can’t wear this!” He puts it on to show how small it is, that it doesn’t fit. “Someone has been to the office storage and rummaged though the old shit we have given away at fairs… I believe we made hats like this a couple years ago.”  I can see that the gift giver looks taken aback. Them someone chimes in “Boss, don’t you think it could be a baby hat for your unborn child?” (that he has shared the news about a month earlier). He starts to look a little sheepish and I guess we move into other things.    

Later, before we head home, collecting our coats, my coworker is pissed. He tells me he deigned the hat himself and ordered it from website to be printed. He even shows me how he did it. For me, this whole thing reinforced my belief that I was working the the Shittiest Boss Ever. New coworker switched offices soon after. I think had already singed at my new company and resigned at that point, haha!    
Maybe it doesn’t sound as shitty and some other people’s horror story, but just the situation of a boss being demeaning towards his young employee about a gift he personalized was just, so, so bad. ",6,1734932449.0,coworkerstories,0,0.88,False

Losing weight is pretty easy if you think of it as a long term shift rather than a diet you do for a brief period of time. These are the habits I integrated into my daily life that let me lose weight easily. 

1. Cut out high added sugar foods out of your habitual diet: key word habitual. Cake at a birthday party or out with your friends for a special occasion doesn’t count. No body gained body fat from the monthly ice cream with friends, people gain body fat from consistently eating at a surplus day after day and it’s easy to do that with sugary stuff at home. The human body was not made for high calorie low satiety foods. We are built for berries, veggies, grains and meats so completely cut out high calorie sugary products from ur home. Do not buy them. Trust me there are healthy alternatives you can switch them out with like protein brownies, smoothies etc.

2. 0.8-1.2 grams of protein per lb of body weight. Pretty simple just eat protein. Fish eggs chicken etc. 

3. Fiber and generally Whole Foods. Eat generally healthy foods most of the time and make sure u get ur fiber

4. Drink plenty of water and before meals as well. One of the ways I ate less without feeling hungry was just drinking water. 

5. Walk 10k steps/ be active generally 

6. Be smart with hunger. Hunger signals to an extent are genetic but they can also be intelligently managed. The sad news if you want to lose weight, u will get a bit hungry at some point or another. How do we deal with that? Well stuff like coffee or tea or water or fasting can help. I personally times my hunger for night time and than just drank tea and went to sleep. I’m one of those people which caffeine supresses appetite hard while also not affecting my sleep too much for some reason. Again this is different for everyone but time ur hunger intelligently when u don’t need to think or be too active. 

7. Stop thinking you are fat. You as an individual are not fat spiritually or like on any personal level. You just have body fat on you. Depersonalize urself from ur body and do not moralize it. Because if you do and u slip up for a few days or eat an occasional unhealthy meal, u will think ur a bad person. All weight loss is a science problem, it’s not a moral prescription of you as a person. So stay positive and focus on the day! 

8. Enjoy urself. Ur not sacrificing big things on the long run to be healthier. In the year of our lord 2024, there are low calorie alternatives to everything . There are 0 sugar high protein brownies, zero calorie sodas, low calorie sauces. Modernity is awesome and u have more tools than ever! So get to a moderate deficit (never go more than 500 trust me) and enjoy urself! U got this!!

Before I leave I’m also leaving my goals now. My goal is to get 180lbs which is the low end for healthy weight range for 6’3” and than I will do a clean bulk upto 200 lbs. 

Edit : Also these suggestions are made to be easy, intuitive and integrate me into any lifestyle. I didn’t put any specific regiments but put a broad set of systems because everyone’s different and I’m giving suggestions anyone can follow . Also in terms of my background I’m 22 and I used to be an athlete in highschool but kinda got chubby in college and decided to lock in and drop weight and for me it came off very easily.

This motor doesnt have knock sensors. I have a 91 tow tune on it. I've been working on cars for over 15 years as a hobby and have never experienced what I describe below.

I was out in the mountains offroading 8 months ago on fuel from the middle of nowhere down in the desert. I defintely filled up with 91. I dont actually remember which station it was because the general area has a few no-name-brand gas stations and I dont keep track of every place I stop.

At some point the next day im going through a technical part of a trail. The engine wasnt at full operating temp yet, but it was warm. I come to a stop so I could shift into low range, but before I did, it felt like a bad random misfire or rough idle, but without the rpm jumping around. Almost felt like a heavy tennis ball bouncing around inside the engine/transmission. Rpm held steady at 600-700. It didnt feel like it wanted to die either. This only happened when my foot was off the gas. Didnt matter what gear I was in (545rfe). As soon as I revved it a bit, that feeling went away. No CEL. It freaked me out, but I didnt have any option but to keep going. I pressed on and it didnt show up again for the 150 mile drive home.

Fast forward to my last trip a month ago to the same area, and it happened again. I never thought about what if I have bad fuel, but I kept going and it went away.

Back in town, when Im driving to work the next day and stop for coffee, I noticed it again. Like last time, the engine is warm, but not at full op temp yet. I know that because I check all my gauges when this was going on. 

At this point the idea of lower octane fuel occurred to me. I was still running on the gas I filled up with on that trip so I figued to do a test and I dropped in a bottle of octane booster. I drove it for another day or two on that same fuel with the octane booster and it didnt act up even though I followed the same morning routine.

This seems to only happen when I fuel up somewhere along the 395 in CA between Mojave and Lone Pine. I never thought to keep track of which stations I went to so I cant tell you which one it was.

Was that detonation/knock? 

How much does octane booster actually raise the octane for 20 gallons?

Do you think this could be a different issue and the fuel thing is just a coincidence?

I posted my symptoms on GERD page, and someone suggested this page. Has anyone gone through anything like this, or recommended next steps??


Here's my story. 


Anyone else have off and on symptoms?

The ""it's GERD"" don't add up. Anyone else? Help it make sense. Seeking support & love. 


This might be a long read, so I apologize in advance. I’ve been reaching out to various support groups, but I feel like I’m getting nowhere and may even be singled out in some cases. Hoping the Reddit community can provide some insight or support.

I’ve been dealing with GI issues since early October and have seen six different doctors so far. I’ve been told it could be GERD, gastritis, or ulcers. While I understand the basics of each, I’d love to hear from people who’ve actually been diagnosed with these conditions.

Here’s what’s been going on:

My symptoms started with a persistent pressure in my upper left side, right below my rib cage, just under my breast area. Sometimes it caused pain, but the pressure was the most bothersome. It disappeared for a bit, but it came back in early October, followed by a host of new symptoms: indigestion, reflux, loss of appetite, vomiting bile, upper stomach pain, and nausea.

After about two weeks, things improved somewhat. Now my main symptoms are a persistent lack of appetite, occasional nausea, burping, and off-and-on stomach pains. I’ve undergone a CT scan, X-rays, a full blood panel, and tests for food allergies, H. pylori, liver and kidney function, thyroid, and hormone levels. Everything came back normal except for a mildly fatty liver (ALT 80).

Some other odd symptoms:
	•	My bowel habits have changed—softer, mushy stools once a day, sometimes with a yellowish hue (though this seems to be improving).
	•	My periods have been shorter, around 2-3 days instead of my usual 5.

As for my GI issues, I think I’m slowly getting better. The nausea happens less often, and I’ve gone days without stomach pain. But my loss of appetite hasn’t improved much. I haven’t been following a strict diet and eat things that GERD sufferers are told to avoid (fast food, soda, coffee, chocolate, alcohol). Most of the time, these don’t seem to make my symptoms worse, though I occasionally get indigestion or stomach pain after eating. It’s hit or miss.

Does anyone have similar experiences? Could this still be GERD or gastritis even if I’m able to eat these foods without consistent issues?

Everyone keeps saying it’s just stress, but I’ve been stressed my whole life and never dealt with symptoms like this.

Any help, advice, or similar stories would mean so much.  Thank you. ",1,1734932130.0,Candida,0,1.0,False

I(28f) met a (36m) 6 weeks ago who quickly used words I wanted to hear, asking for and promising exclusivity, validating my values and character, saying I’m exactly the kind of person he’d marry and have children with; said he believed we had what it took to make it long term;; slowly sprinkled info about living at home with his mom, quitting his part time gig, and not actually being in nursing school yet, has felonies he confesses to later that are going to prevent him from becoming a nurse; begins self deprecating and having trouble getting out of his bed, but sees me 1-2x a week. The first week we dated, he blew off loose plans made the day prior. He did the same the following 2 weekends, and promised he’d be more available after his last final.. at which point he proceeded to blow me off 2-3 more times. He tells me last weekend when I let him sleep over that the girl he saw prior to me broke up with him after seeing him daily for 2 weeks and was in the coffee shop on our first date. When he had his phone open, I noticed the tinder app.. I mentioned I saw it and he deleted it, then offered to let me see his phone. I declined. When he went home he told me he missed me already. Skip to Wednesday where he declines to join me for a date and is already in bed at 6pm, breaking things off Thursday. He cited a lack of feelings for me, while apologizing profusely and engaging me in conversation for the rest of the night. Primarily it was him putting himself down and glorifying what a “great person I was, best he’s ever dated, better than him in almost every way”. I was okay.. I knew for at least 4 of the 6 weeks that I was being an idiot allowing him to be in my life, but that parts of our relationship made me feel wonderful and briefly forget about the sickening feeling of being ditched- every time with a great excuse, and every time with some sulking that made me feel like I shouldn’t end things. 

Reddit, I’m writing to you because I know I chose poorly. I know I stayed when I should have left the first time I was blown off. I’ll tell you the truth- I thought his initial excuses were valid, and by the time they were obviously bullshit I was numb to it. I thought if he kept coming around he’d have a chance to fall in love, and that then he would put in the effort and want to see me more. I know I’m worthy, but I don’t act like it. This isn’t my first offense. I almost exclusively date losers and liars. I’m not 100% sure why. I don’t need advice, but I think it’s time I heard some brutally honest opinions.

Security Head Robert Dowle parked his jet black Corvega Atomic V8 in the parking garage directly adjacent to the  building and got out promptly. His light blue bulletproof vest hugged his solar plexus tightly, and his badge ID, tightly laminated in plastic, dangled from his neck -- only adding to a self perceived stoicism. 

The elevator hummed its way to the eleventh floor where the main security ""command"" node stood in the center of the floor controlling all computer terminals, monitoring inbound and outbound communications as well as phone calls made to and from the building, and conversations captured by hidden microphones dotted around the office space labyrinths. As Dowle stepped out of the elevator, his boots made a recognizable thumping sound as he walked upon the shined marble tiles below him. 

**""Hey Richards. How was the morning shift?""** He asked, placing his belongings next to the desk located at the command node. 

**""Oh man. We got some sketchy outbound comms coming from the fifth floor. Retail division. They're talking way above their pay grade.""** Richards responded with an eager smirk as he positioned the terminal towards Dowle, who was more than happy to quickly approach the terminal, his face squinting to read the text as a bright green glow amplified his natural green eyes.

Dowle made his usual rounds until close of business, to which he begrudgingly had to perform another walking circuit through all halls of the corporate labyrinth once more before settling down at his command desk, watching the eerily still frames of CCTV footage rolling on with nothing but the faint hum of AC units performing their overworked duties floor by floor.

After a few button presses and imputed terminal prompts, the Securitron pod on floor 20 opened, air pressure exhaust blew all over the optics of the CCTV camera, yet the securitron remained in an idle status within its pod. 

**""God fucking damn it. Useless trashcans.""** Dowle said, lazingly getting up from his worn chair, briefly adjusting his utility belt before making his way to the elevator bank. 

As the elevator smoothly brought him to the 20th floor, there was something different. Dowle noticed broken glass leading to the base of the Chief Researcher's office a mere ten feet away from the elevator bank. Dowle, with a steadfast sense of duty resembling that of a super market cop, unholstered his 10mm pistol and began to walk towards the sign of disturbance, his flashlight beaming a weak and unpolished battery life towards the glistening shards as they lay sprawled all over the crisp beige carpet that blanketed the entire floor. 

Creaking open the door, the terminal in the office was active, illuminating the dark office riddled with science notes and book shelves containing information on various weapon systems. Dowle approached and imputed a command prompt.

*/// LastActivePGM.Run ///*

The terminal clicked and sent pack an information packet that had Dowle screaming obscenities and hurrying towards the elevators to make it back to his command node on the 11th floor. Upon arrival, Dowle quickly picked up the red phone, a phone only to be used in matters of emergency, and rotated the dial frantically. 

**""Yes!? YES. It's Dowle, Chief. I hate to wake you up. We just had an external file transfer on the 20th floor. Yeah. The CRO. Clear breach. Roger that. I'll standby for the investigators.""** Dowle hung up the phone and began to scan his immediate surroundings before eying each floors CCTV footage feed. Something caught his eye on the 12th floor feed, the floor right above him belonging to the Office of Foreign Relations. Dowle squinted at the obvious movement and strained to try and identify the weird texture moving about the screen, quickly tapping away the movement notification bombarding his terminal. 

At that very instant, a Crimson Dragoon Chinese Stealth Suit came into focus, before the feed quickly cut to pure static. 

**""Well. Fuck.""** Dowle said.

He dumped me bc he finally decided we were “incompatible” (took him 1.5 years to figure that out) 

After the breakup he wanted to be friends and meet up for coffee once a month and catch up. Initially I was all for it bc I wanted to hold onto him a little longer but later I realized I cannot have someone in my life that clearly chose to not want me. 

I told him we need to go no contact and blocked him. A few weeks later somehow he was able to leave me a voicemail and I called him back bc I thought he was hurt. Turns out he just wanted to ask me how I was doing and I ended up cussing him off bc I was so mad he disrespected my boundaries. 

I’ve had a lot of time to think about and frankly everyone in my life later told after the breakup that he wasn’t the right guy for me. He was immature, didn’t know what he wanted from life and I doubt he really loved me. 

I provided an escape for him and there were a lot of time throughout the relationship where I thought I was being used for my body (I told him many times and nothing changed).  There’s more but I won’t harp on about it. 

My life instantly got better the moment he left but I’m still having trouble getting though the feelings that I let myself go in the relationship and didn’t advocate for myself. 

I like to see the best in people and thats why I primarily stayed. It hurts knowing I did so many things for him and this is how he treated me? Even during the relationship I was so dumb to believe every critic he had of me no matter how small. 


It’s all a clusterfuck and I know I’m gonna be ok in the end but it just sucks as I don’t want to let these feelings negatively impact other areas of my life. 

Any advice?

I pulled up for my regular oil change and fluids fill up service at the mechanic shop like normal. 

After talking to the dude and asking him what i wanted to be done (i wanted oil flush and oil service of 10,000 km and all my fluids filled) they opened the hood.

They told me there was a head gasket leak, and gave me details for that. 

So my head gasket was not broken nor cracked at all maybe it became a bit bent or of some sort.

But i am really confused since head gaskets normally get damaged when there is overheating, and i haven't drivin the car rough for a while and didn't drive very fast as well for a while, maximum maybe up to 110kmph.

Its a Toyota Prado 2008 with 217,000 km on the odo.

I want to know other possibilities of the head gasket blow, since i want to avoid it in the future at all costs. And i assume it wasn't due to over heating.

There were no warning lights on the dash, the temperature was normal, and i have already checked all my sensors and electronics and the fuse box in the car.

This experience has left me very confused.

Also, there is a possibility of the head gasket issue due to less oil, because when they checked my oil stick it was right on the part where the low line is, but the mechanics told me that low oil cannot be the issue since the engine was still running smoothly.

Also to note my oil colour was dark like it always is when i do my oil change, it wasn't chocolate milky or milk coffee colour.

It is running well so far, this happened yesterday.

Google and YouTube isn't helping me very much.

Any suggestions or tips are welcome.
Thank you in advance.
Have a nice day.

---------------------------------------------------

When it comes to staying healthy, one of the simplest things you can do is to stay hydrated. You might be wondering, ""How much water should I drink daily?"" The answer can vary based on several factors, including your age, activity level, and overall health. Understanding your hydration needs can lead you to many benefits that enhance your daily life.

One of the most common recommendations is to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily, often called the ""8x8 rule."" This guideline is easy to remember, but your individual requirements may differ. Here are some significant factors that influence how much water you should drink:

- **Body Weight:** Heavier individuals generally need more water. A common rule is to drink half your body weight in ounces. For example, if you weigh 150 pounds, aim for 75 ounces of water.
- **Activity Level:** If you're very active or exercise regularly, you’ll likely require more fluids. Consider sipping water before, during, and after your workouts.
- **Climate:** Hot or humid weather can cause you to sweat more, requiring you to increase your water intake.
- **Diet:** Foods high in sodium or protein may need you to consume extra water to help your kidneys process these nutrients.
- **Health Conditions:** Certain health conditions, such as fever, diarrhea, or urinary tract infections, can lead to increased fluid needs.

Staying well-hydrated comes with numerous advantages. If you're asking yourself how much water you should drink, keep these benefits in mind:

### Aids Digestion and Prevents Constipation

Water plays a key role in digestion. It helps break down food, making it easier for your body to absorb the nutrients. Drinking enough water also helps prevent constipation, as it keeps your stool soft and aids regular bowel movements.

#### Weight Management

If you're looking to lose weight, increasing your water intake may help. Water is calorie-free and can help you feel full, reducing hunger and preventing overeating. Drinking water before meals might help you consume fewer calories.

### Enhances Skin Health

Hydration has a direct impact on your skin's appearance. Drinking adequate water can help your skin stay supple and may even reduce the appearance of fine lines. Well-hydrated skin may also look more vibrant and less saggy.

### Supports Kidney Function

Your kidneys filter waste from your blood and require enough water to function effectively. Drinking sufficient water helps dilute your urine, thus reducing the risk of kidney stones and urinary tract infections.

### How to Increase Water Intake

Now that you know the importance of hydration, here are some simple strategies to ensure that you're drinking enough water:

- **Carry a Water Bottle:** Keeping a reusable water bottle with you can remind you to drink throughout the day.
- **Set Reminders:** Use your phone or an app to set reminders to drink water at regular intervals.
- **Infuse Your Water:** Enhance the flavor of your water by adding fresh fruits, herbs, or a splash of lemon to make it more appealing.
- **Drink Before Meals:** Make it a habit to drink a glass of water before each meal.

Remember, while the general guidelines can help, it’s best to listen to your body. Consider your circumstances and individual needs to determine how much water you should drink daily. By incorporating this simple habit into your routine, you can reap numerous health benefits that enhance your daily life.

The Impact of Hydration on Physical Performance
-----------------------------------------------

Hydration plays a crucial role in overall physical performance. Your body is composed of about 60% water, and staying hydrated is essential for various bodily functions. Not only does drinking enough water support your general health, but it also significantly impacts your athletic abilities. Let’s explore how proper hydration can enhance your physical performance.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Why Hydration Matters

Water serves several critical functions when it comes to physical activity:

- **Temperature Regulation:** During exercise, your body generates heat. Sweating helps cool you down, but you must replace the lost fluids. Adequate hydration ensures your body can efficiently manage its temperature.
- **Nutrient Transport:** Water helps transport essential nutrients to cells. When you're well hydrated, nutrients and oxygen can reach your muscles more effectively, promoting better performance.
- **Joint Lubrication:** Proper hydration keeps the cartilage in your joints lubricated. This lubrication helps reduce friction and wear during physical activity, leading to improved mobility and reduced injury risk.

### Effects of Dehydration on Performance

Even mild dehydration can have adverse effects on your physical performance. Some signs of dehydration include:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Thirst and dry mouth
- Fatigue and decreased energy levels
- Dizziness and lightheadedness
- Headaches
- Decreased coordination and cognitive function

When you're dehydrated, your endurance, strength, and coordination can suffer. A study found that even losing just 2% of your body weight in fluids can lead to notable declines in performance. For athletes, this can mean the difference between winning and losing.

### How Much Water Should You Drink?

Many people wonder how much water they should consume daily to stay properly hydrated. While individual needs vary, a common recommendation is:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- About 3.7 liters (or 13 cups) for men
- About 2.7 liters (or 9 cups) for women

These guidelines include all fluids consumed throughout the day, including from food sources. However, if you're physically active, you may need to increase your water intake based on the intensity and duration of your workout.

### Timing Your Hydration

Effective hydration isn’t just about how much you drink, but also when you drink. Here are some tips to stay hydrated:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Before Exercise:** Drink 16-20 ounces of water at least an hour before you work out. This ensures you start off hydrated.
- **During Exercise:** Sip on 7-10 ounces of water every 10-20 minutes while exercising. If your workout lasts longer than an hour, consider a sports drink with electrolytes.
- **After Exercise:** Rehydrate with 16-24 ounces of water for every pound lost during your workout. This helps replenish lost fluids and supports recovery.

### Hydration and Endurance Sports

For endurance athletes, maintaining hydration is even more critical. In sports like running, cycling, or swimming, losing too much fluid can lead to a decline in performance. Studies indicate that endurance performance can be impaired by a loss of just 2% of body weight due to sweating.

By developing a personalized hydration strategy, endurance athletes can improve stamina and overall performance. Keeping track of your fluid intake can be beneficial in maintaining peak performance levels.

Common Myths About Water Intake and Hydration
---------------------------------------------

When it comes to staying hydrated, there are many beliefs about water intake that can often be misleading. Clearing up these myths can help you understand how much water you should actually drink. Let’s explore some common misunderstandings about hydration that can impact your health.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 1: You Need to Drink Eight Glasses of Water a Day

While the widely cited advice of drinking eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily, known as the ""8x8 rule,"" serves as a useful guideline, it isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. Your individual hydration needs can vary significantly based on factors such as:

- **Your Activity Level:** If you are active, you may need more fluid to compensate for sweat loss.
- **Climate:** Hot and humid weather can increase your need for water.
- **Aging:** Older adults may have a reduced sense of thirst and may need to drink more consciously.

Listening to your body and paying attention to signs of thirst will help you better gauge your hydration needs.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 2: All Beverages Hydrate You Equally

While all beverages contribute to hydration, not all are created equal. Coffee, tea, and certain sugary drinks may have diuretic effects, leading some to believe they contribute little to hydration. In reality, moderate consumption of these beverages can still help with hydration. However, plain water is always the best choice when it comes to optimal hydration.

### Myth 3: You Should Wait Until You're Thirsty to Drink Water

Thirst is an important signal that your body needs hydration, but relying solely on it can be misleading. By the time you feel thirsty, you may already be mildly dehydrated. To stay ahead, consider drinking water regularly throughout the day, even if you are not feeling particularly thirsty.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 4: Drinking Water Can Help with Weight Loss

While water itself doesn’t directly burn fat, drinking water can play a supportive role in weight loss. Staying hydrated can help you feel fuller, which may prevent overeating. Additionally, choosing water over sugary drinks reduces calorie intake. Remember, it’s not just about drinking more water; it’s about making healthier choices as well.

### Myth 5: Clear Urine Means You Are Completely Hydrated

While clear urine can be an indication of good hydration, it doesn’t always mean you’re perfectly hydrated. Certain factors, like what you've eaten and any medications you’re taking, can also influence urine color. A more nuanced approach is to note the color of your urine and consider it alongside how you feel overall. Light straw color is generally considered an ideal indicator of hydration.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 6: If You're Not Thirsty, You Don't Need Water

Many people think that if they don’t feel thirsty, they don’t need to drink water. However, factors like environmental conditions, physical activity, and health can affect your hydration levels. It's crucial to take a proactive approach to hydration by incorporating regular water intake into your routine, regardless of immediate thirst signals.

### Myth 7: Sports Drinks are the Best Choice for Hydration

Sports drinks are often marketed as superior for hydration, but they’re mostly beneficial for athletes engaged in prolonged and intense activities. For routine hydration, plain water is usually sufficient. If you're doing moderate exercise or daily activities, water should be your go-to. It’s always wise to read labels since many sports drinks contain high levels of sugar and calories.

### Myth 8: Drinking Water in Large Amounts Aids in Detoxing

Some people believe that drinking excessive water can flush out toxins, but your kidneys do an excellent job of this naturally. Overhydration can lead to a dangerous condition known as water intoxication, disrupting electrolyte balance in the body. Instead, consume water in moderation to support your body's natural detoxification processes.

By debunking these myths, you can better understand how to optimize your hydration. Aim to drink water consistently throughout the day, listen to your body’s cues, and make choices that support your health.

### Conclusion

Staying properly hydrated is an essential part of a healthy lifestyle. Understanding how much water you should drink daily lays the foundation for achieving optimal health. Remember, hydration impacts not only your physical performance but also your mental clarity. Improved focus and cognitive function can stem from simply drinking enough water throughout the day.

Anyone else feel like society is losing it? I know social media is optional, but it’s wild how little control we have over what’s thrown at us. I’m so over it.

We’ve had five fun, eventful dates lasting 4-10 hours, with activities, dinner, and chilling at my place after. We've hooked up on the 2nd date. I've tried my best to treat her really well including giving her some of her favourite snacks she mentioned on our first date, picked up some smoothies when she's sick, buying her and her family coffee and pastries when she had a busy week. I also taught her how to budget and invest since I do fee based consulting for this on the side. 

After our 5th date on Dec 3rd, I’ve tried making plans 3 times. The first two she said she was busy and didn't offer any days where she was free. On the 3rd attempt, which was going to be my final attempt and I will humbly take it as she's not interested. She responded this time that she's busy for the remaining 2 weeks of December, even though she has 2 weeks off work for the holidays, but mentioned she’d be more free in January. While I get the holidays can be hectic, having a 3-5 week gap early in dating feels like it could kill the momentum.

I’m torn between giving up on something good but I'm very proactive in weeding out low-interest behaviors that will end up wasting my time and resources in a ""If she wanted to, she would"" type of situation. 

Here's a list of low-interest behaviours 
- Text replies take 10-48 hours, except for 1-2 days a week when she’ll respond instantly.
- Sometimes ignores 2-3 parts of my messages asking her about her interest / plans / question she asked me about and replies to a 3-4 part message with a short 1 liner to the least important part
- When she said she's busy, I said let me know when you'll be free and we can set something up but she didn't follow up for over a week. 
- Stopped sending/responding to IG Reels.
- Never asks about me or makes any efforts to plan dates through text 
- Only messages me first about her life if I go distant for a week.
- Didn’t ask to hang out in December, which is also my birthday month.

She mentioned during the early dates that her texting will suck and her friends noted this as well. However, if I had plans for another date set-up I can go handle minimal conversation until the day comes and save it for in-person.

Here's his usual food routine (He is going to the gym and trying to lose weight, so he is very conscious about calorie density. He won't even drink whole milk);

Breakfast: 3 eggs, usually boiled, with sugar free yogurt and granola. Also a fruit, either an apple or banana, with black coffee. He only drinks water and coffee, no soft drinks ever and he HATES tea
(If I'm with him, very occasionally I'll make him some cinnamon banana and protein powder pancakes which he loves)

Sometimes he'll have ""lunch"" in between, which is usually a can of tuna and some mayo, but not often

Dinner: 1/3ish lb of ground beef, 1/2-3/4 cup of white rice, a couple of tortillas and half of a salad mix bag. Sometimes he mixes it up with chicken wings but not often

He loves peanut butter, coleslaw, wings, coconut water, eggs benedict, plums, cheetos, raw broccoli, hashbrowns, alfredo, mushrooms, and for restaurants Wingstop and Chick-Fil-A :) and just loves moderately spicy food in general

He hates tomatoes, bell peppers, honey, fries, olives, sweet potatoes, tea, raisins, siracha and cheedar cheese. Tonatoes, sweet potatoes and tea being the biggest hates.

This is a long one so buckle up. 
Back story: My mom and I were very close growing up since her and my dad got a divorce when I was young and I lived with her. Through college, she was my rock and my saving grace. I called her for everything. Breakups, friend drama, money trouble, everything. 
In 2020 i got engaged to my now husband and I noticed changes…
My mom started being a mentor to a young girl in high school that was in foster care. She takes this girl on lunch dates, coffee, shopping sprees, etc. 
She sees this girl more than me. 
Every-time my mom invites me to go somewhere, its always on her time and when Im busy. She will text me the day of “hey come over for dinner” when my husband and I already have plans. Or she will say “the whole family is getting together and doing ___ activity this week you should come” when she knows I’m out of town. 
She guilt trips me when we talk on the phone saying, “you make time for the people you love” and “well i dont even know what you look like because I haven’t seen you” or “when are you going to come see me?” (For context she lives an hour away from me and I work M-F 7-5) 
Today though, we had an hour long conversation and it went well, or so i thought.I am off work for the next 2 weeks and She failed to mention the whole family was coming over to her house tonight. I had no idea about it. I facetimed my brother randomly to ask about Christmas plans. I saw he wasnt at his apartment and asked where he was. He was at my moms. Okay cool, he goes there all the time. I heard a bunch of laughter in the background. I asked, who is all there? And he said “oh just all the siblings”…. What? 
I said, “what? Why did I not know”
He said, “well mom said that you wouldn’t come anyways if she invited you since you never see her”
I was shocked. I told her on the phone I wasn’t doing anything today besides going to the gym. I feel like she is outcasting me because I am married and have a life now.

She is scheduled to come visit us over Christmas for three nights (Monday-Wednesday). My husband (57) is her only child. He is retired and planned to pick her up toward the end of the day tomorrow. He has two appointments and an errand to do during the day. Today (Sunday), she started complaining about how bored and neglected she is. She demanded he change his day around to pick her up early, but these are not things he can change. When he said he would text her after his last appointment, she kept demanding until finally he stopped answering her texts. Now she has said “Fine. Don’t pick me up. I’ll find someone to do it who really loves me.” AITAH for telling him he should reply “Let me know how that works out for you.” (Not that he did; he just didn’t reply.)

Background: Like most facilities like this (at least in the San Antonio area), they have trouble keeping good caretakers. None pay well and the hours can be bad, plus you have to have the right mentality to work with the elderly. And the food is never that great because they have so many dietary restrictions. She is constantly complaining about the workers. She has managed to get a lot of special treatment, such as they bring her meals to her room, even though she is able to go to the dining room with a rolling walker. They bring her coffee in the morning and the cooks sometimes even make special meals just for her. Most of these perks likely came because of her constant criticism and demands. 

My husband visits every Tuesday, plus takes her to all her doctor, hair and nail appointment, etc., on other days. She complains constantly about being bored because she’s “the only one there in her right mind,” even though she is not in memory care and we’ve had meals there several times for holidays and had good conversations with other residents, some at length. I’m sure she is lonely and bored, because none of the activities they do seem to appeal to her. 

We try to take her on outings once a month and she comes over for several days every holiday. She spent three nights with us over Thanksgiving. She refuses to sleep in a bed we offered to set up for her in our downstairs study and instead sleeps in a recliner outside our bedroom door. She really would like to live there in that chair, but we don’t have the capacity to cater to her and she has no respect for boundaries. She even opened our door at 6 am one of those days to ask us to give her another blanket from the stack that was right by her chair. She has ruined holidays for us on more than one occasion with her narcissistic behavior, but we always work to include her. 

We are dreading this week. Sorry for the verbal dump.

I had posted here before about whether selling coffee holders and litter box accessories in the same shop was a bad idea. The takeaway from that post was it shouldn't matter because buyers would click on a link that'd bring them directly to a listing, rather than to your shop...

So this buyer of a litter robot accessory just left me a review and also attached a photo of a little box. Now that photo is showing up in the ""Photos from reviews"" section. I can only see more people leaving photos of litter box as this product becomes more popular.

I wonder if that'd potentially drive buyers away when they are shopping for my coffee holder?

Am I worrying too much as it's not really a big deal?

Budget is under $1000 USD

I did a search…and of course, since I am an American Male…I think that my post is different than all of the things I found already..so I’m going to post a new post…with hope that it will help me…and maybe even help someone else in my boat.

I’m embarrassed to say….the wife and I have spent $1800 total on Nespresso pods this year…yes I did the math….not to mention untold amounts of metal and plastic put into the “landfill”…although we did recycle 99% of the pods…so hopefully those don’t go to the landfill.

We are not using Nespresso Classic, but the Vertuo line…in case that changes anyone’s thoughts. 

We both do espresso or the larger version double espresso….2 each per day, maybe 3 for my wife….I do the exact same coffee ever time every day.  My wife does use the half caf and the decaf so that may be one of the issues we would have in switching.

Looking for a machine that just makes espresso….maybe with the flexibility to make a double espresso…for the extra fluid ounces mostly…but we do not need a machine to make anything fancy or even use a steam wand.  We use a frother now and would likely continue to do so…I actually pour cold milk into my cup first before I brew…so I’m even less picky, my wife likes the foamy milk.


Can I get away with a Barastina perhaps..or something simple like that?  Will the quality of coffee be “at least” as good as the quality I get with a Melozio Nespresso?  

My reason for this is the waste honestly…and the fact that 1800 bucks seems like a shit ton of money to spend on coffee…at home…cheaper than a Coffee Shop fix….but still seems a little spendy.

Do any of the machines have the ability to remove a bean hopper easily to use different beans throughout the morning (decaf/non decaf)?  Or would we just not fill the hopper completely to switch from caf to decaf

Any advice would be excellent.  

We came from the pour over scene….got tired of the extra work…”graduated” to Nespresso land….ready to make another move.

This was not what Sil had expected out of their return.

They were at the Twins, and had ran straight inside the Rock of Mourning of all possible places. It had to be a joke. A grand, cosmically designed joke on their behalf. They’d escaped one deathtrap place filled with unimaginable horrors, only to end up somewhere worse.

It had to be a test of some kind from the goddess herself. The portal had sent them thousands of leagues away. It wasn’t supposed to do that. No portals could travel that far. They were all anchored to the nearest illum hearth and would pull their destination along the ley line. But, then again, nothing about the day had seemed any sort of normal.

Luna sat on the table next to her, faded from view, colour matching the old wood. Vergil had gone back out into the killing field to help the wounded. Good lad. She felt proud of the man he was becoming, even if it was happening in spite of her and Tallah’s influence.

A haggard-looking healer approached her from one of the operating rooms.

“What is your calling?” he asked without preamble. By the bags under his eyes and the stoop of his shoulder, the old man had been working for days without rest.

“Iluna,” Sil answered.

“What’s your allotment?”

“Full. I can deal with the worst cases.”

He nodded and pressed a hand to his face. “Finally, on the last breath, we receive an answer to our prayers. Thank the Goddess to have sent you.” He gestured to the side and showed her into a room filled with makeshift beds. They were all occupied with the dying, cases where only the goddess could intervene.

“Do you have experience in triage?” he went on as he gestured for several other younger healers to approach.

“Yes,” she said, already looking at the nearest wounded. Amputations were plentiful. Those didn’t need the goddess’s touch unless they went septic. “I’ve been to battlefields before.”

“Good. Good. You don’t need me telling your job. Use your allotment quickly.” He gestured vaguely in the direction of the gates. “More will come. The Rock is bleeding to death.”

She set to work, the two younger healers—Adanas both if she were any guess—trailing her and doing their own inspection.

Soldiers cried out in pain as she checked their wounds and assessed their chances. To some she granted the goddess’s healing. Others she left to the bonesaws and to mundane medicine. Her store was empty of accelerants and she hadn’t had the resources to brew more after the mishaps in Grefe. It seemed like the Rock was also in crisis.

Bandages were old rags stained with old blood, washed and repurposed. The beds were mostly just pails of straw on the hard, stone floor. This was a despairing place.

She’d heard the daemon sieges got bad in thaw. But this bad? It seemed impossible. Tallah had been right to ask about the cadre. There was supposed to be an entire cadre of mages manning the twin fortresses and providing their support in dealing with the monsters at the gates. Tallah wouldn’t be enough on her own, but already the cheers from outside meant she was making a difference.

Still, she turned her focus to the work. Amputation. Clean cut. Bone saw. Gut puncture. Healing. Daemon bite. Face area. Hopeless. Administered some of her last poppy. And on and on the wounded went. Vergil brought in more. She showed him the beds and he obliged. Went out immediately after setting down his load. She made the effort of maintaining the helmet’s effect, but the draw wore on her.

Ink nettle helped. They had precious little of that left as well. She used a bag as Vergil brought in his fourth wounded. Blood dripped off his armour, but he gestured her away when she came to check.

“Not mine,” he explained as he rushed back out. “There are more coming.”

*Of course there are more coming,* she thought glumly. Most of those she couldn’t heal would be dead by morning. Her aides already dragged corpses out the other side of the room and laid them out in a courtyard. Their healing allotments were spent, so all they could do was either help her, or see to the dying and their last rites.

“*I require this one be mended,*” she intoned the prayer. Nothing happened. “Blast.” She grabbed one of the girls and asked for needle and thread. “My allotment’s gone. How long to midnight.”

The girl stared at her, eyes wide in terror. Sil shook her. “How long, girl?”

“T-t-two b-b-bells,” she stammered.

“Good. Take the bandages off the dead. Boil them. Report to me once you’re done with that. Do you understand?”

“Y-y-yes, lady.”

She walked away as if in a daze, setting to the work. The other one was made of sterner stuff. She drifted closer and handed over her needles. “I’ll get more,” she said. “We don’t have any antiseptics left. Medicine is low to nothing. We do what we can.”

Sil nodded and set to cleaning wounds. She’d barely made it past the first row of wounded with her initial allotment of healing.

“Is it nightly,” she asked as she worked in tandem with the girl.

“And daily. We’ve had no reprieve for more than a tenday.”

*Goddess’s blood, what’s Aztroa doing?* Normally there was always supposed to be a full garrison at the Twins. Aztroa was supposed to have an army at the two fortresses, to stem the tide of monsters boiling out from beneath the mountain. There were supposed to be mages present, a whole cadre of the empress’s best. Where were they?

Vergil nearly collapsed after his tenth load. He looked pleadingly to her but she shook her head. The draw drained her, as did the constant healing. It was a low cost to invoke the goddess, but it was a cost nonetheless. When he pushed himself off the floor to stagger out, she relented and used another bag of nettle dust. Two more remained. There would be no other supplies in this place.

Soon the midnight bell sounded. The room filled with a gaggle of exhausted healers. Fewer than Sil expected to be manning a place like the Rock. Most of them were Adanas, some barely more than initiates. The old man from earlier took over some of the triage work, guiding the younger ones on who to heal.

Sil guided the two girls—they’d said their names at one point but she hadn’t been paying attention—until their allotment was spent.

She looked about as people began filing out of the room, less than a bell later, trailing the soldiers that were well enough to walk. It was little surprise that the demon armies outside maimed first and killed second. Maiming cost them healing and still sidelined the warriors.

There were no Gerras available. It shook her. A place like the Rock should have had at least a dozen of the chosen to impart near endless healing. That there were none spoke of dire times indeed.

She took over and began the triage again just as Vergil and the other man with him brought over another two patients. Both had been bit and were, likely, beyond help. She didn’t say so while the boy was still there.

The flow of wounded slowed to a trickle in the following bells. Then stopped altogether. She reached the end of the ward and began anew with more than half of allotment left. Her assistants watched the door and shared looks. Then they looked to her, as if she had the answer.

“Did… did the cadre come at last? Were you with them?” the stern one asked.

“No,” Sil answered candidly. So, they’d been waiting for relief from Aztroa. “It’s just me and two friends. One’s a pyromancer.”

Their eyes widened at once but their shoulders slumped. “Just one?” They looked at the room and then back at the door. “Just one…”

“Don’t gawk. Night’s not over.” Sil clapped her hands. “Boil water. Clean bandage.” She dug into her rend and extracted several vials of disinfectant alcohol. “Use these. Dilute to a ten-to-one ratio. Clean whatever wound we haven’t yet. Let’s not get infection running rampant.”

The two jumped to obey. Morning light streamed in through one of the windows. She only now realised, surrounded by the moans of the surviving wounded, that it had grown quiet out there. Distant cheering filled the air, coming as if from a great distance.

“They’ve pushed them back tonight,” someone called from the courtyard outside.

“The line held. The line held,” another voice echoed. More people cheered, closer now.

Where had Vergil gotten to? The tether was still drawing on her, just not as acutely. He was resting. She gritted her teeth and kept it up, just in case.

“Cinder! Cinder’s here!” a voice called from atop the walls. “Gods be praised, that’s Cinder out there!”

And she heard what she’d never thought possible: the entire building shook with people chanting Tallah’s old name. Her back tightened in worry and she considered running out, finding Vergil and doing as Tallah had instructed. But her hands refused to stop working.

Men and women here needed her help. The two aides came back with buckets of scalding water and freshly cleaned linen. They came to work side by side with her, sewing and wrapping up wounds the best they could in the small, miserable space.

“They’ll live,” the quiet one sobbed. Thick purple bag hung under her eyes. “Goddess be praised, we won’t lose more.” She let out a soft whimper that could have meant anything. Sil understood.

There would be no more dead in this room, at least not on this morning.

“Adella. Castien. Go rest,” the old healer ordered as they finished sewing up the last soldier. The others that came in on their own two feet weren’t in any danger now, and were taken under care by the mundanes.

The old healer walked into the room, took a long look at the work done, and let out a pleased harrumph. Sil nodded to the two girls, finishing the work on her own. They wouldn’t be far, maybe just in the next room, sleeping on whatever proved softer than a rock, waiting for the next crisis.

“I need your name,” the old man said.

“Silestra Iluna.”

“I’m Kor Iluna. I’ve never heard your name.”

Before she could answer the lie—it had been much easier to be an Adana, but the goddess would brand her again if she lied now—Kor went on. “Mighty fine work. Mighty fine. You came in the darkest hour of our fortress. Are you Cinder’s friend?”

The question was casual. The interest polite. The implications would guarantee her the noose. Surrounded by soldiers, some of them awake and staring, she felt cornered. If she admitted, Silestra Iluna would forever be an enemy of the Eternal Empire. But to lie would be stupid.

She swallowed and admitted to her betrayal of the empire. “Yes. Tallah’s my friend.”

Kor nodded solemnly and held out his hand. “May you be welcome here, Silestra. Thank you for all you’ve done thus far.”

They shook hands and she could see no lie on the man’s face. He was as exhausted as everyone else she’d met since arriving, if not more so.

“How long since the siege began?” she asked. “Where are the mages? Where’s the other army? We only saw one in the field.”

Kor held her hand for a time, then released it and looked around. “This is the army. The only one left. As for the mages, they’re all dead.”

*A whole cadre… dead?* She reeled at this, the idea too preposterous to consider. There had always been mages at the Rock. Twenty to thirty at least. This was where the empress sent some of her best and most well trained channellers, to defend the realm from daemons. That they were all dead spoke of terrifying possibilities.

“Since when?” she found herself asking.

“End of wither, give or take some days. It was betrayal within the walls. Assassins.” Kor spat on the floor. “Fools. Bloody, thrice-damned fools. We’ve held off the worst of it, but the siege bled us dry. We weren’t expecting to see this dawn. And here you are, you and Cinder. The goddess heard our cries at last.”

Had she?

The portal had behaved oddly. Had they been her instrument in truth? Or was there something else at work?

Sil chose not to think on it, not now. She could hear the cheering drawing closer.

“Seem your friend’s coming back,” Kor said. “You go and meet up. I’m sure Vilfor’ll want to see both.”

She shook her head and pulled back the sleeve of her shirt. Kor’s eyes widened at the scars on her forearm.

“Leave the freshest with me,” Sil said. “Take the others and go rest. I’ll handle whoever’s left. I give my word.”

His eyes darted from the red marking’s scars to her face, then back again, distrust in his eyes. She hadn’t hidden her marking, so she wasn’t ashamed of it like most would be. And in truth she had no reason to be. Panacea hadn’t punished her for anything, simply used the marking to warn of her arrival. Telling that to Kor would make him far more suspicious of her—and think her either an audacious liar, or insane—than would just revealing the scar.

In the end, he shook his head and called out to several others. From everywhere in the hospital people gathered and drifted away to rest wherever they could. Sil was left with three healers and several young girls and boys that were helping with mundane tasks. She set them all to work after a cursory inspection of the operating room. Her own fatigue stung at the corners of her eyes, already a full day awake and running around, but she refused to rest.

Someone pushed a mug of coffee into her hands. It tasted bitter. She didn’t ask for sugar. There would likely be none left after a season’s desperate siege.

A change drifted in the air by midday. They couldn’t save everyone and the pile of bodies in the courtyard only grew. But there was this inkling of cheerfulness now. Waking soldiers talked and jested. They asked after friends. They asked for news that Sil couldn’t give them. All of them were hungry for news of the outside world after an entire season spent fighting and isolated.

Those awake were eager to ask about reinforcements.

Was Cinder back with the empire? Had she been forgiven?

Were they the advance force of a fresh cadre?

Was the empress herself coming?

Was Ria marshalling to help?

Had it been a good winter in Aztroa? Had there been more earthquakes? Were people safe?

They all thought her and Tallah emissaries of the empire. Even when she refuted, they still kept their optimism. At least they now had Cinder fighting on their side. There was a chance now that they weren’t alone against the starving daemon armies. There would be hope at long last.

Luna kept out of sight, hidden under beds and tables, providing silk for the needle. None of the other helpers noticed that Sil’s own thread never seemed to run out and she was thankful for the spider’s relentless help. It didn’t owe any of these humans anything, but it had willingly stood by her side and did what it could.

“Go and find Vergil,” she whispered at it when the din outside calmed down. “Be careful.”

It hesitated for a moment. “Is friend Sil sure?” it asked, voice low.

“I’m sure. Go on. I’ll be fine here. Come back to me if he’s in trouble.” She was drinking her fourth cup of bitter coffee. It barely tasted any different from mud, but it would do.

Luna went and did as told. If Sil hadn’t known what to look for, she wouldn’t have noticed the slight discoloration moving across the red-brick wall and how it disappeared through the door leading outside. The spider had a nearly supernatural sense in finding the boy.

It was late afternoon before the other healers returned to relieve her. No more of the soldiers in the ward had died. Part of Sil was proud of this, of more good achieved. Even so, she wasn’t surprised to see fresh soldiers accompanying Kor. At least they had their weapons sheathed.

“Commander Vilfor wants to see you too,” Kor said without preamble. “Carin and Albert will take you to him.” To her raised eyebrow, he added, “You are not being detained. We are not fools here. Not all of us.”

She let out a short laugh and slowly rose to her feet. Her back ached from working hunched over. Her white clothes were… well, the less said, the better. “I don’t think I’m in a fit state to meet with anyone at this time,” she said without much conviction. “If he won’t baulk at the sight of me, let’s go.”

“We’ve been rationing fresh water,” Kor said as she walked past. He grinned. “You’ll be hard pressed to find anyone smelling of roses here.” They shared a short chuckle.

The trip was unpleasant. After running through the forest and snow, working all night and day hunched over the wounded, to be made to climb stairs all the way up onto the wall was a kind of punishment she didn’t feel she deserved.

“May I?” one of the soldiers asked.

She raised an eyebrow, already two flights up.

“May you what, kind sir?” she asked, tone dripping sarcasm.

Without answering the question, the knight scooped her up into his arms and took the stairs two at a time. For a moment, Sil wanted to protest but thought better of it. It was nice to be carried for once in a way that didn’t bruise, shake, or make her sick. Given the effort of the day, she allowed it to happen.

The man—she thought this was Carin—took her up to the top of the stairs, then down a winding network of corridors and galleries leading up to a small room filled with maps and absolutely packed with people.

“I see you’ve arrived in grand style.” Tallah raised her eyes from the map she’d been studying and barely concealed a grin.

All the other men in the room turned and stared at her. Vergil was also there, fast asleep on a chair, helmeted head at a peculiar angle. It took a small effort of focus to recognise Luna’s shape acting as a pillow for the boy.

“And I assume this is the healer that’s cut our losses in half.” The speaker was the tallest, most scarred vanadal Sil had ever laid eyes upon. His head scraped the lowest beam of the room and he stood with a stoop, all hands balled into fists, resting on their knuckles on the table. “I, and the garrison here, owes you a great debt of gratitude. Be welcomed here, if nowhere else in the entire gods-forsaken empire.” He nodded and turned his attention back to the maps.

The knight put her down and the other produced a chair from somewhere. It felt indulgent to sit, given what she’d seen in the ward below, but her feet were grateful.

“What did I miss?” she asked, looking at the assembled council of war. It could be nothing else.

All around were scarred men dressed in battered, bloodied suits of armour. In places, the blood had dried to brown crusts. Long fighting and its toll were evident on all their faces, one more worn than the other. The vanadal himself looked to have faced a whole army of beastmen himself, and carried the scars of a thousand duels.

“Well, we’re in deep dark crap,” Tallah said without looking up. “The ravine out of here has been collapsed to seal the Cauldron. All the mages are dead. Aztroa is quiet. And the second fortress has either been conquered, or has been isolated entirely.” She tutted. “This is the worst situation here since Catharina came down from Aztroa Magnor the first time.”

“Except it’s even worse,” the vanadal said and raised his head. “Catharina brought the might of the empire with her back then. We’ve only got you.”

“And you’re bloody lucky for it. Someone’s been listening to your bleating, Vilfor,” Tallah said. She gave Sil a wink. “Or else why would the goddess of healing herself have sent us all the way here? I was supposed to be a thousand leagues away.”

Sil sighed and rubbed at her eyes as Tallah’s words ignited the room. Where there had been dour resignation now bloomed the excitement of hope. Plans were formed. Orders issued.

And she… she nearly fell asleep on the chair. She was just about ready to scoot her chair closer to Vergil’s and rest her head on his shoulder, when Tallah spoke.

“There’s a bloody dragon out there. How active is it?”

“Very,” Vilfor said. “Swoops down and snaps up a good number of soldiers in every engagement. It’s a new development. Only came out once the snows began clearing.”

“Bloody lovely. It’s on the daemons’ side?”

“I haven’t the bloodiest. Seen it eating just about anything. We can only hope it’s neutral.”

Tallah looked at Sil and they grinned at one another. “Good news is that I’m here,” Tallah went on. She stretched and rolled her shoulders.

“And what’s the fresh bad news?” Vilfor crossed his upper arms and straigthened as well, towering over the sorceress.

“The bad news is that my luck’s been absolutely abysmal for the past couple of seasons. Get ready for hard times ahead. I seem to drag them around.”",2,1734929997.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

In any case, let me share my story.

Once upon a time, there was a tall, nerd, and not-much attractive guy *pero pwede na* who woke up one morning, looked at the sky, and thought, ""Well, this sucks."" He knew there was only one solution - to turn to the all-knowing oracle of modern dating: T̶i̶n̶d̶e̶r̶ Reddit lol.

With his trusty cup of spanish latte coffee in hand, he set out to find someone who shared his thirst for knowledge, someone who could keep up with his quirks, and someone who he could eventually take on 'friendly' and ‘wholesome’ dates (whatever that means). He wasn't in a rush to jump into anything too serious too soon, but he knew that someday, he wanted to find someone he could build a meaningful and caring partnership.

So if you're a fellow lover of specialty coffee, learning, and all things nerdy, this tall drink of water might just be the partner in crime you've been looking for. Dating at times feel like a job hunt doesn't it? You either get guys who sends nsfw stuff right away or you get a friendly ones so I thought it’d be fun to write it in a mock format just like a resume! LOL

##About me

An old soul as older people I spoke with would say, into small business and investments, 2nd year law student (took a LOA this year), can drive a fucking 10 wheeler truck (sarcasm towards people looking for someone with wheels), no ex issues or sabit, can provide a certificate of no jowa (kahit wala naman talagang ganon haha). Last relationship (6 years) was 3 years ago.

- I'm 5'10"", physically fit and active, resides in quezon city. I would say that average level attractive yet clean and hygienic

- I'm an INTJ-T Architect, Aries, if you’re into MBTI and believes in that people have 12 personalities (horoscope).

- Loves to read self-help books as I love to learn and motivate myself along the way.

-  I'm the kind of person who doesn't follow the herd blindly, even if it means standing alone in a field of conformity. My principles are like a compass, always pointing me in the right direction, even if it's not the most popular route. In short, I'm not afraid to swim against the current, as long as it's in line with my beliefs.

-  You could say that my communication style is like a triple-layered cake: serious, meaningful, and sprinkled with a healthy dose of humor. Sure, I may come off as really awkward at times, but that's just my way of keeping things interesting. After all, who wants a bland and flavorless conversation when you can have a deliciously complex one? So, if you're looking for someone who can engage in a thoughtful discussion, crack a few jokes, and still leave you with something to ponder, then look no further.

- I'm what you might call a clean freak with a creative streak. As someone who's a bit OC (okay, maybe more than a bit), I can't stand to see a messy or cluttered home. But don't worry, I'm not the type to wait around for someone else to do the dirty work. I take pride in noticing when something needs to be done and taking care of it without being asked - it's like a satisfying little victory every time. And when it comes to interior design and home decor, I'm practically a pro. I'm always on the hunt for the latest and greatest tools and gadgets to keep things looking fresh and stylish. So if you're looking for someone to spruce up your space and keep things sparkling clean, I'm your go-to guy.

- I'm not in the business of putting people down - unless we're talking about the volume on the stereo (badum-tss!). But seriously, I believe in treating others with kindness and respect, even when it's not the easiest thing to do. After all, life is hard enough without having to deal with someone else's negativity. So let's lift each other up instead of tearing each other down, shall we?

- I set long-term feasible goals and actively pursue them.

##Here's a list of my favorites:
Movies/Series | Music | Places | Activities | Books
:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|--:
Godfather | Radiohead | Paris | Cycling | The Daily Stoic by Ryan Holiday
Sherlock | Eraserheads | Coffee Shops | Painting | How to Win Friends & Influence People
Castaway | Nirvana  | Cebu | Muay Thai | Meditation s by Marcus Aurelius
Forrest Gump | Ebe Dancel | Japan | Scuba/Freediving | Start with Why by Simon Sinek
Homeland | Urbandub | Rome | Piano | Atomic Habits by James Clear
Before Sunset | Frederic Chopin | Canada | Running | How to think like a Roman Emperor
The Office | Eminem | New York | Cooking | Letters from Stoic
Big Bang Theory | John Mayer | Maldives | Film & Photography | 48 Laws of Power
Breaking Bad | Elton John | Marrakesh | Badminton | The Intelligent Investor

##Pros:

- Respoņsible (Good credit score, no debts, no criminal records, and self-reliant)

- Curious type of person, who's ready to listen and craves to learn a lot of things

- Doesn't do drugs and is not a heavy drinker/alcoholic.

- Respects your views and accept healthy criticism. Respects personal space and time

- Actually appreciating the things you'll do for me, and showing it. If you cooked a big dinner, saying thank you is nice. Doing the dishes and cleaning the kitchen is even nicer, and in my opinion, should be the norm. The cook doesn't clean. If someone does something for me, I'll show them that their effort was appreciated instead of just accepting their generosity and then running off back to whatever I'm doing.

- Accepts respònsibility or has accountability for one's own action and does not try to blame everything or everyone else. 

- No addiction/s, tattoos and not into online games

##My preference:

- Someone who has a strong passion for accurate and comprehensive learning, maintains a normal BMI, physically active and is beautiful and easy on the eyes - I believe that beauty comes in all shapes and sizes (no offense intended towards plus-size women!).

- High standards for what she wants and is not afraid to communicate it.

- Craves knowledge too. Love and isn't afraid to try new things

- Passionate and proud about something they've been working on/have done/are planning to do

- Confident about what they want but isn't in-your-face about it.

Let's take a break from stressing over the mundane and focus on the important stuff - like what will make us happy for the rest of our lives!

Hi everybody, It’s Markus. I know I’m not the best writer compared to her, but Billie asked me to come on here this time, she told me this story was “best told first person”, so you're stuck with me for now. Sorry, not sorry. ;)

The next day I woke up later in the afternoon, I was exhausted from packing with Billie’s family and really needed those extra hours of sleep. I texted Billie, replying to her 8 million worried messages before walking downstairs. My mom and I were sitting on the couch, she was reading and I was looking out the window watching my neighbors walk by, walking their dogs, drinking coffee on their porch, all that stuff. My mom sighed and put her book down, reading something on her phone. I asked her what was wrong to which she replied she forgot to text Billie's mom back. I assured her it was fine, and so she sent a quick text before running upstairs to change or something. 

I laid back on the couch looking at the ceiling, there was a small mark right above me. I couldn't tell if it was a scratch or a bug, either way, I didn’t want to find out and moved to the kitchen for a cup of water. My mom walked downstairs and told me she was going to clean out the shed before it rained again. I wished her luck and reminded her that I would be in the garage working on the car. She smiled at me warmly and went outside. I sat in the quiet for a little before I changed my clothes to work.

I walked into the garage, it was dark and dusty. Every time I walked into the garage I always felt this knot in my stomach. I wasn't the biggest car guy,  I mean hell if you were to ask me a question about cars when I was younger I would tell you to get a life and tell you five million monster facts or something. I just never was into cars, but my dad, he loved ‘em, older cars a least. He would take me to the garage to work on this damn car almost every other day, all he wanted was to get this thing running, but it never was ready, always a new problem to fix. 

I flipped on the lights and closed the door behind me. An old 1956 Mercury Turnpike Cruiser, originally a bright orange, but now the paints just faded to a gross yellow. I tried my best for the better half of 8 years to get this thing going, and I felt I was nearly there. Every time I look at it all I see is my dad staring back at me. I wish I tried harder when I was younger. I wish I could've had the reality of us driving together in it, but I didn’t.

I walked over to the small shelf with all my stuff and grabbed the shit I needed. I worked on it for a few hours before I came out and made myself a sandwich. I was sitting at the table when my mom came downstairs. She looked at me, before asking me why I didn’t make her one as well, I looked at her with a smug smile before pointing at her plate that was sitting on the counter. She laughed and walked into the kitchen, grabbing her sandwich, and sitting next to me. We talked for a little while longer before I went back to work. I was trying to find my safety glasses when I saw Billie's mom walk past the garage. I was going to say hi, but I figured they were just going to leave, so I just let her be.

I heard the door open and shut before I threw my headphones on. I sat for a while, looking for another thing to fix when I thought I heard something outside the garage. I took my headphones off and I heard something break. I stood up and ran to the door, I grabbed at the knob, but it wouldn’t open. I threw myself against it but It wouldn’t move. I could hear my mom yelling, I yelled trying to get through, begging my mom to open the door, begging to know what was wrong,  but I just couldn’t get to her. I pulled the garage door open and ran to the front, it was locked. I turned to my neighbors all around me and yelled for help, but they just looked like I was crazy. I clenched my fist in frustration and shoved my elbow through the door's window, cutting my arm against the broken glass as I reached for the knob. I swung the door open and expected to see the worst to hear the worst, but there was absolute silence.

I got into the house and looked around, it looked untouched. I grabbed a kitchen knife and walked in further. My mom was nowhere in sight. I stood there, my hands shaking. I didn't know what to do. I just looked around, until I heard slamming from upstairs, and I yelled for whoever was there to get out of my house, then it was quiet again. I heard my bedroom door open slowly.  I could hear its voice. It growled.

 Like a fucking animal.

Though it didn’t sound right, it sounded like somebody screamed all day and then tried to imitate an animal. I couldn't see anything, the top of the stairs was shrouded in darkness. I screamed at it again then I heard it cough, a painful dry cough. It was quiet for a while before it called my name. It was my mom, at least, my brain wanted to believe it was her. My whole body screamed at me to believe it was her, but I knew better than to believe this thing. I clenched my jaw, waiting for it to move but it just stood there. 

I could hear it breathing, its voice may have sounded like hers, but Its breath showed the truth, it was heavy and low like a man’s. Then I heard the sirens, and so did it. I waited there staring up the stairs, I can only imagine it was staring right back at me. I slowly backed up, walking to the light switch behind me. I put my hand against the wall and slowly reached for it. I flipped on the light, but I could only see its eyes peeking from my door in the hallway.

It was my mother's eyes. 

“What do you do, where is my mom?!” I screamed.

“Her” eyes widened and said, “Markus, don’t be silly, why don’t you come up here and help me?”

I just looked at it and told it to come out. It started to open the door. I expected to see its long discolored fingers wrap around the door, to see it begin to stand up, rising to the top of the door, but that wasn't what I saw.

What I saw was my mother.

Its eyes, warm. Its smile, comforting. Half its body showing in the light.

“Markus, why don’t you come up here.” It said, much lower than before.

I looked at it, really looked at it. It looked like her yet so different, the skin, the mouth, the hands, the eyes. It was as if my mother had a twin, its complexion looked softer than my mother's, and it had a wider face and a comforting expression. I felt as if my brain was tricking my body, my shoulders relaxed and I lowered the kitchen knife slowly. I knew this wasn’t my mom yet I felt comfort in this thing's presence, I closed my eyes before looking back up at it.

This fucking thing, it ruined my life, I have spent so many years of my life trying to pretend this thing never existed, but it’s impossible to deny now. It opened the door wide, exposing its entire body, looking at me with a twisted smile. Its eyes widened with each second. It looked down at me with a twisted expression of pure happiness. I could see its jaw was hanging wide open. It took a step forward. I heard cars pull up infront of my house and I quickly glanced behind me.

I looked up the stairs, its face was filled with anger and frustration, but it just shut the door violently, sending a strong vibration through my body. I ran upstairs to search for my mom, she was lying upstairs in her room. She had glass sticking from her side, I hovered my hands over her not knowing what to do. I heard the door open and I begged for help. When police searched the house, it was gone. 

That thing nearly killed her and It would have killed me if I had been inside. When we made it to the hospital they rushed her away from me and I was left alone waiting in that cold hallway not knowing what would happen next. I sat in silence waiting for hours until they got her to a room. I walked in slowly and sat myself next to her. I tried to talk with her but she was coming in and out of consciousness. She was just in so much pain, all because of me, because I wanted to live my life like a normal person. 

I felt like a failure, I couldn’t protect her. I failed her, my dad, Billie, all because I wanted to play pretend. I felt so ashamed. My hands were shaking so badly, I couldn’t tell if it was from fear or hatred. I looked down at my hands.

It took me 8 DAYS to get a no. i then told my mom i finally got a straight answer and she complained to me in front of him that i should have expected it and he got angry too because i ""complained to her"" and told me i was definitely not playing on it because i was bugging them and said hes going to sell it or put it back in storage. most likely just so i cant use it (we are on very bad terms)



now keep in mind i have been going up and beyond for him, making him breakfast and coffee, i have been doing tons of chores without being asked, i even spent 2 hrs scrubbing the hard water that was caked onto the toilet with a steel sponge and no gloves. also keep in mind he NEVER uses the laptop its over 1000 dollars (i checked) and when he does, he plays games that Hardley utilize the laptop or watches anime and the last time he used it was 1-2 years ago. and i mostly asked to play on it to play games with my siblings. like i said i worked more than often for 8 days waiting for a yes or no and i got a no even tho he got the pc out of storage, charged it and updated it just to say no to me and get me in trouble after i was upset after he said no (yes i was sulking) but he was pretty much dangling in my face like a kitty treat so obviously i was upset after he made it seem like i would be able to play when he knew he wouldn't let me. maybe he will let me play on Christmas idk. 

  
i get i was annoying and i was sulking and its his pc but i did so much and was very patient and asked very nicely. i just wanted to play with my siblings. AITA",0,1734929389.0,AmItheAsshole,4,0.5,False

(F18, M18, M20)","Phew. Okay, I F18 have been seeing this guy, M20 for about a month now. Things have been going okay but I'm not sure a committed relationship is what I am looking for from him. Anyways, I messaged my friend last night, F18, because recently I've been having a lot of thoughts about my crush from high school, M18. I had a crush on him for three years in high school, we're still pretty good friends but don't see each other much since graduation six months ago. I asked her to find out if he had ever had any sort of feelings for me at any point, because I was dying of curiosity and truthfully just haven't gotten over it. For context, nothing ever happened between us in high school. Just a silly crush I had and never could seem to shake.

This morning, I woke up to a text from my best friend, saying she needed to meet up with me. We go grab coffee, and she shows me a series of messages between her and HS guy. Turns out, he liked me the entire time that I have liked him- nearly four years now. I was absolutely astonished, because I had never expected reciprocation in feelings. 

This leaves me with a small issue. I started seeing this other guy like I said about a month ago. It's nothing official, although we do hangout a lot and he has made it clear he's looking for something more than we have. I am more than tempted to break things off with him to pursue the boy from HS. But some part of it feels wrong, like I'm doing both of them wrong in a way? I don't want to leave one guy and jump right to the next, but this is soewmting that I have wanted for such a long time and it feels unreal that it actually could happen. I'm torn and not sure what I should do. I feel I know what's right, but an outside opinion is always nice.

  
TLDR: My crush from HS likes me and I'm not sure if I should break things off with my current date. ",1,1734929374.0,relationship_advice,1,0.66,False

👔 Motion Graphics Off the Rack? Nah, Not for You!
You know those one-size-fits-all motion graphics? They’re like buying a tuxedo from the bargain bin and expecting it to make you look like James Bond. Spoiler alert: It won’t. Your brand deserves better—motion graphics tailored to its unique personality, vibe, and pizzazz. Because, let’s face it, your brand is not a copy-paste job.


---

🖌️ Why Settle for Generic When You Can Go Picasso?
Imagine explaining to your designer, “I need something bold, but also friendly, with a dash of sleek professionalism—and maybe a sprinkle of fun.” Boom! Custom motion graphics are your answer. They take your brand’s identity and paint it into every transition, animation, and visual. It’s your story brought to life—without looking like it borrowed someone else’s crayons.


---

🎢 The “Wow!” Factor That Makes Heads Turn
Here’s the thing: motion graphics aren’t just decorations—they’re experiences. Customizing them means creating visuals that make your audience stop mid-scroll and say, “Wait, what?!” It’s like building a rollercoaster ride for your brand—every loop and twist perfectly designed to leave an impression. And the best part? No lines, just results.


---

💼 Tailored Graphics: The Business Case
“But isn’t customizing more expensive?” Sure, but so are tailored suits, and nobody regrets looking sharp. Custom motion graphics aren’t a cost—they’re an investment in your brand’s wow-factor. Plus, you avoid the dreaded “Wait, isn’t that the same animation from our competitor?” moment. Awkward.


---

🤝 Your Brand, Your Rules
With custom motion graphics, you’re not just getting animations; you’re getting a handshake, a wink, and a knowing nod from your audience. They’ll see your visuals and think, “This brand gets me.” And let’s be honest, isn’t that the ultimate goal?


---

🎬 Ready to Go Custom? Let’s Animate That Dream!
Whether you’re selling artisanal coffee or high-tech gadgets, your story deserves a stage. And that stage? Custom motion graphics. Let’s ditch the templates and start designing something that screams you. So, what are you waiting for? Let’s get moving—literally!

1hkg7lh,https://www.reddit.com/r/vagabond/comments/1hkg7lh/i_guess_it_was_about_time/,I guess it was about time.,"After sometime in the southeast of the United States, I found that my time here is finished I think. I ended up moving to West Tennessee for a relationship that has now ended and I'm heading back out on the road. 
I only decided this less than a week ago and I've already started to get rid of the small amount of goods I've acquired in the past for years. I'm going to be in a 97 Acura Integra. Got to love Honda engines they're not broken in until 300,000 mi. I got some odds and ends to tidy up. 
I have found though that being housed up like this makes me feel really unhealthy. A resort to negative copping mechanisms to manage myself in a way that to the outside world it seems productive. But it kills me a little more everyday getting up and going to work and giving the perception of being responsible. 
That's not who I am though. I need the road just as much as it needs me. It's not that I dislike the creature comforts of modern living. They are nice but I don't feel like this is what I'm supposed to be doing, at the very least here. 

Now I'm trying to figure out where to go, what to do. Nothing about it is scary or unsettling. I know how to do all the bum stuff and be able to survive somewhat comfortably. I prefer not flying a sign but, you got to do what you got to do sometimes. I get it and I don't frown on it one bit. 
I've kind of thought about having a female companion with me to balance out the energy. I don't want too much masculine not enough feminine. While it would be great to have a road dog, I still don't know though. 

The only thing I'm sure of is it my time here is done and I got to get the hell out of here. I don't know what I've become but it certainly hasn't been an improvement for what I call being a good person. I kind of think the most authentic and genuine part of me is being on the road. 

I miss seeing new people and places. Morning coffee over a fire or Coleman burner made with a French press. I've missed so much by intentionally blinding myself. I'm just trying to get back to who I really am.

1hkg1bn,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1hkg1bn/ive_been_stuck_at_the_youth_with_psychic/,"I've been stuck at the Youth With Psychic Abilities Institute since I was twelve. Today is Christmas eve, and I'm getting out.","I was playing cards with Ethan, a pyrokinetic and a sore loser.

That asshole kept burning the cards to ashes every time I won. 

Ethan, designated as category red, was the closest thing I had to a friend. 

He was a big dude with a surprisingly bigger heart; an ex-high school jock who had become my roomie two years prior. 

I could tell he’d been popular—probably from an affluent family—so he likely wasn’t staying long. 

They brought him in one night, kicking and screaming, and strapped him to the bed opposite mine.

For the first few weeks, Ethan wasn’t allowed to use his hands. 

He sat cross-legged on his bed and told me how he’d set his entire town alight. 

Sitting in the cremated remnants of his letterman jacket, with his thick brown hair and freckles, he looked like the textbook boy-next-door. I thought he’d be harder to talk to, but he was oddly talkative. 

At first, I thought it was the drugs they force-fed him, but then he became obsessed with telling me his life story.

And with telling me how he’d accidentally burnt his girlfriend’s eyes out, which somehow led to him attempting to torch his entire town? I know, I told him it was extra. 

Ethan insisted it wasn’t his fault, that there was a “voice” inside his head telling him to do it, but I already knew I was talking to a category red—and that was before they even brought in his collar, which mediated his emotions, and was as dehumanising as you would think. 

I admit, I was initially pretty fucking scared of the guy. 

—

It’s not exactly brainwashing, but the moment we’re brought into the institute and categorized as lower levels (blue, indigo, and violet), we’re taught to steer clear of kids categorized at higher levels. 

Those are the ones who need to be muzzled and collared: pyros like Ethan and kids like Carlisle, the girl in the room next to mine. 

Carlisle was a Speaker, capable of bringing her own words to life, and super powerful for all of her 17 years on earth. 

She told her guard he was suffering from a brain hemorrhage, and seconds later, he was. Carlisle wasn’t just being held at the YWPA because of her ability. She was being protected from world leaders and other ne'er-do-wells who could easily use her for their own personal gain. 

Kids like Carlisle and Ethan were the lost causes. Here one minute, gone the next. 

I half-expected Ethan to disappear one day while I was being tested on, or forcing down mystery meat that passed as cafeteria food.

But it had been almost two years, and pyro boy was still my roommate.

I was category blue, a high-level telekinetic, so it’s not like we could relate to each other. 

Ethan was more likely to be executed at eighteen due to the severity of his case.

But weirdly enough, I enjoyed his company.

Just like school, the YWPA had a social hierarchy. Blues, who were most likely to be recruited for some shady government program, were at the top. JJ Walker and Alex Simons, lower-level blues, had already invited me to join their little gang, but I wasn’t interested in their weird obsession with becoming soldiers. 

I’d been brought in at twelve: those kids had been at the YWPA since birth, never seeing sunlight and being subtly conditioned to enjoy the idea of becoming mindless drones for some higher power.

Those types of kids were noticeably more feral and animal-like, baring their teeth when guards grabbed them for daily testing. JJ was already giving me cult-leader vibes. Instead of being scared of his ability, he embraced it. 

Meanwhile, I had a feeling the mandatory Friday classes for low-level blues were screwing with their brains—maybe even prepping them for recruitment. Luckily, I was able to avoid it.

It wasn't easy at first. But the second I was dragged into a classroom-like setting, with an ancient analogue television at the front, I knew my fate. It was part of being recruited, after all. 

People in the real world weren’t interested in noncompliant telekinetics. 

They wanted brainless shells. 

There was only one way of getting out of mandatory classes, which were either life lessons for the rare occasion that you would be released, or plain fucking brainwashing. I had no choice but to play the unhinged card—which was risky and could either end with me getting executed or sent to therapy.

So in the cafeteria, I staged a breakdown, pinning several kids to the ceiling. I was taken down almost immediately, of course, and thankfully, instead of “military training” in my schedule, I had “Psychokinetic Therapy.” 

So, instead of being subjected to what I could only guess was some seriously messed up shit (judging by the rapid decline in the blue’s humanity), I sat in a room with my personal therapist, who taught me how to manage my power and not abuse it.

Speaking of the other blues, they started being more annoying than usual, sitting at their usual table embedded in a game of silent chess. Which was chess, but nobody talked, and each member used their ability instead of their hands. 

This kind of information has been nailed into my brain since my imprisonment inside the YWPA, so I know the nitty gritty of the category blue. 

When you're categorised as blue, you can either be a low level or a high level. 

Low levels can do simple telekinesis, which is moving or controlling an object or organic matter with their mind. 

High levels, however, can extend their ability to the brain. 

That's one of the reasons why blues are so popular in recruitment. 

Whereas low levels are wanted for their simple ability to move objects, high levels are in demand for their ability to control minds, like influencing or erasing memories, and in some cases, managing a complete take-over of the original organic personality. As a high level, I knew my day was coming sooner or later. 

I couldn't fully master what we called 
Influence yet, but I did successfully manage to push my instructor to punch me in the face, and then erase his memory of performing that action. 

Which meant I was extremely close to being recategorized at a higher level. 

It was Saturday night, which was a free day. Nepo babies were allowed monitored time with their parents, while the rest of us had to keep up appearances in front of the elites, pretending we were having the best time ever and definitely weren’t being abused and tested on. 

I mean, if these people were as perceptive as they thought, they’d notice the blood stains. Right?

The Velcro straps on every bed. The execution room, which was just one big industrial furnace.

Every time a kid was burned alive, the YWPA played Taylor Swift at full volume.

When I was thirteen, I was being dragged back to my room in cuffs after standardized testing. I remember the right side of my body was numb and my nose was bleeding, beads of warm red dripping down my chin. It itched as it dried, but I couldn't do much about it. 

The drugs were already destabilizing my limbs, making it impossible to run, my vision swimming in and out of focus. All I could see were clinical white walls crashing into me like ocean waves.

I wasn’t expecting to hear Taylor Swift. I can’t remember what song it was, just the same lyrics repeating as I was dragged down the hallway toward a bright orange blur.

You found me, 

You found me,

You found me-e-e-e.

“Move,” my guard ordered, shoving me forward. 

That song followed me all the way back to my room. 

When I was freed from my cuffs and shoved inside, I layed down and pretended I couldn't hear the agonizing screams from adjacent cells slicing through those lyrics. 

I had pretty much accepted my fate as either ending up in there, being fucking barbecued to an upbeat pop song, or joining my fellow blues as a military drone. 

I didn't even fucking dream of walking out of the YWPA on my own two feet. 

With my mind intact, at least.

Christmas in the YWPA was about as fun as you would expect. There was a single Christmas tree themed sticker on the wall for a “decoration.” 

But I wasn't even sure if some kids even knew what Christmas was. Jessa Harley, who was executed three days after her arrival, asked JJ if he wanted to do a secret Santa, and the boy looked at her like she'd grown a second head. Jessa was another scary one, a category white. 

Her ability was similar to a Speaker, but on a mass scale. So, you can imagine how fucking terrifying she was. 

But she didn't look scary, she looked harmless! Jessa was tiny with orange pigtails and a gentle smile.

As cute and innocent as she looked though, Jessa could obliterate our universe if she wanted to. 

She could also prevent war if she wanted to. The rumor mill churned, and I heard from an Indigo, that Jessa had snapped her own family out of existence. 

But Jessa used her power for small things. She wanted a puppy, and bam, there was one in her lap. 

She wanted a swimming pool, and suddenly, a whole new indoor pool hall just appeared at the end of the first floor. 

She was both a miracle and a curse, and I don't think the YWPA trusted her– and others were out there hunting her down. 

Jessa was only there for three days, but had left an impression. 

The swimming pool, for example. It's not like we could use it, but it was still there. 

The white plastic seat where she'd sat cross-legged, eagerly asking people's names, sat sadly empty. 

—

I was losing patience with Ethan, who thought burning my cards would make him a winner. 

The worst part is, he was actually making me laugh, shooting me a grin every time my Queen burst into flames. 

It was funny the first few times, but was getting progressively less entertaining. 

I found myself smiling through gritted teeth just as the large metal door flew open, making me jump. Ethan flinched, his gaze glued to his deck of cards. 

He was about to turn the big one eight, which meant his evaluation was soon.

Execution, or, if they were feeling merciful, maybe a re-sentencing until he was twenty five.

I kicked him under the table when he didn't lay down his cards. 

Ethan kicked me back, his eyes growing frenzied. 

“Fuck.” He whispered, his gaze dropping to the table. “I bet they've come for me.”

I kicked him again, this time reassuringly. “You're still seventeen, dumbass.”

“Yeah, but not for long.”

I raised a brow. “Why would they kill you at seventeen?”

“Because they're fucking assholes.”

Leaning across the shitty fold out table, I fixed him with a smile. “What if you're fire-proof?”

“All right, listen up!”

The voice snapped me out of it. Twisting around, Warden Carrington stood in the doorway, twirling a pair of metal cuffs. 

She was a stiff, narrow bodied woman with a blonde top-knot and a permanent grin. She took pleasure in escorting kids to be executed. Bile crept up my throat. 

Is that what this was? No, executions were usually private. 

Tests, maybe? 

I was used to mandatory ones every Friday. That's what the cuffs were usually for. We were taken from the rec room individually, cuffed, and dragged to the testing rooms. But it wasn’t Friday. 

The floors were too clean. I was used to blood seeping across tiles on a testing day. 

I wasn't allowed to look the warden in the eye as a Blue, but I managed a risqué glance. She was smiling suggestively, so it had to be an execution. Realization crept in then, that the slight curl on her lip suggested exactly the opposite. 

Recruitment.

I scanned the room.  Fifteen fearful faces staring at her.  

A willowy blonde who had previously been reading a dog eared paperback, was now sitting up straight, her half-lidded eyes wide, almost awake. She caught my gaze, lips pricking into a smile. 

Slowly, the girl inclined her head, a single blonde curl falling into her eyes. She ran her index finger across her throat, mouthing, “We’re fucked.”

Could it be Matthews? 

My gaze flicked to the brunette curled up in the corner of the room. Carlisle? I used to talk to her. We were from the same town, so we had that mutual connection. 

But something happened to her after a testing session, and since then, Carlisle shut everyone else out and isolated herself. 

Matthews was immortal, and Carlisle had the power to end the world. 

I doubted either of them were being recruited.

Unless world leaders needed Carlisle, which wasn't entirely out of the realm of possibility. 

“The holidays came early, kids!” Warden Carrington mocked, and I sensed the group of us all holding a collective breath. 

“Johnson!” she boomed. “You’re getting out of here!”

There was an awkward silence before Ethan kicked me. 

“Bro, that's you!”

He was right. Slowly, I got to my feet, my heart pounding in my chest. 

I was Johnson. 

Which was crazy, because the only kids who made it out of the YWPA alive were either nepo babies or… 

My excitement started to wither once I'd hugged Ethan a quick goodbye, and offered Carlisle a sympathetic smile. 

I thought, just for a moment, that maybe my Mom had come to get me– finally, after five years. But my mother was dead. 

I watched a man who called himself Mr. Yellow blow her brains out with a smile, before kneeling in front of me. 

I was standing in my mother’s blood, watching slow-spreading crimson seeping across her favorite rug.  

“Hey, there, little boy,” he said, his eyes maniacal, grin widening. “Do you want to come to a super special place?”

The ‘super special’ place was obviously the YWPA.

I didn't even get to fucking mourn my mother. 

And to everyone in the outside world, twelve year old Johnson had murdered his Mom. 

There were only three ways to get out of YWPA: in a body bag, or the other way—the one I dreaded.

Warden Carrington was smiling with way too many teeth when I slowly made my way over to her. She grabbed my arms, linking them behind my back and cuffing me. 

“You’ve been… recruited!”

I was dragged out the door and down the hallway. 

At the end, surprisingly, stood a guy my age. He was tall, a pair of raybans pinning back dark blonde hair, wearing a long trench coat that hung off his slim frame.

In his hand was a small paper bag he was swinging excitedly. 

The closer I was getting, being unceremoniously pushed forward by the warden, the guy’s swinging became more and more eager. I was convinced he was going to accidentally fling the bag in my face. I wasn't expecting to be recruited by a teenager resembling a teen Sherlock Holmes.

“Hi!” He greeted me, genuinely excited to see me. The boy motioned for the warden to uncuff me, and she did, making sure to keep hold of my arms, her bony fingers pricking into my flesh. “It's great to finally see you in person! I’ve been trying to get you out of here for weeks! But there's so much paperwork, and blah, blah, blah, it was a whole mess,” he rolled his eyes. 

“But here you are!” His southern accent was already irritating. He grabbed my shoulders with teary eyes like I was a stray fucking cat he had just adopted. 

“You're Johnson, right? I'm Nathanial!” he held out the bag, and I caught the unmistakable smell of fried food. “Do you want Five Guys?”

Warden Carrington cleared her throat. “Not in here,” she drawled, “The smell will wake up Will.”

Will was a higher level category yellow (a shifter). But I fully understood why. 

Werewolf. 

Apparently, he'd been sacrificed to the moon during his frat’s hazing ritual, gaining the ability to shift his flesh to a dog-like beast. As well as adapting a liking for human flesh. There were two incidents with Will, and both of them ended in him cannibalizing at least three inmates. 

Nathaniel looked intrigued, but he kept his mouth shut. I was handed a fresh set of clothes to change into, before being shoved through the main doors. 

I couldn't believe I was actually breathing in real, ice-cold air.

I could feel it tickling my cheeks, blowing my hair out of my eyes.

In the real world, I stuck out like an anomaly in my clinical white shorts and tee.

I was standing on concrete, uneven and gritty beneath my shitty Converse. 

Twisting around, I stared up at the YWPA—a looming glass building. 

We were in the middle of nowhere. 

I hadn’t noticed on my way into YWPA because I was blindfolded. Nathanial pointed across the parking lot. There was only one car, and it was his: an expensive, sleek-looking Range Rover. 

I tried to jump into the back, but he patted the passenger seat. 

Nathanial slid into the driver's side. “So, there are, like, actual werewolves in that place?”

I shot him a look, resisting the urge to roll my eyes. I didn’t know why he was fascinated with werewolves when there were kids in there who could snap us out of existence if they were slightly annoyed. 

Slipping onto the warm leather seats, my muscles started to relax. I was so used to the harsh, shitty plastic chairs in the YWPA rec room.

And then there were the blood-stained metal gurneys I had to sit on during testing.

But this—this was an actual *seat.* I had missed cars. I’d missed being able to sink into cushions.

To relax.

Nathanial started the car, cranking up the radio.

Taylor Swift.

Not just Taylor Swift, but that exact same fucking song.

He shot me a grin, reaching into the back and grabbing the bag of Five Guys.

“Hungry?”

I was.

I ate the burger in two bites and almost choked on the soda.

“Dude,” Nathanial chuckled, side-eyeing me. “The food isn’t going to run away.”

Asshole.

I started inhaling the fries, ignoring his little jab.

“I can understand, though. Of course you’re fucking hungry,” Nathanial said, his gaze flicking to the road ahead. 

I couldn’t resist pressing my head against the window, slurping my Coke. 

The vivid red and orange blur of traffic flying past was making me carsick. 

“I know what goes on inside that place, and the inhumane shit they do to kids like you makes me enraged.”

“Kids like me.” I stopped chugging, a sour bite to my tone.

He sighed. “You know that's not what I meant.”

“Sounded like it.”

I caught his expression darken significantly, his fingers tightening around the wheel.

“I’m sorry, Johnson,” he said, his tone cracking slightly. “For what those fucks did to you. I fought to get you out of that place.” he scoffed. “They kept trying to shove another kid in my face, but I told them it was either you, or I was out.”

“Why me?” I didn't turn around to look at him, my gaze stuck to blurry holiday lights flying past us. 

They were too bright in contrast to the darkening sky. 

Nathanial didn't respond, cranking up the radio. 

I wasn't buying this guy’s friendly act. I had a hard time believing his ‘save the children’ bullshit.  “So, what do you need me for?” I asked, making myself comfy. “Construction? Did your cat get stuck up a tree?”

“Nope.” His lips curled into a smirk. “Do you know what day it is?”

I gestured to an illuminated snowman outside. 

“Easter.” I deadpanned, and he let out a hyena laugh. 

“I'm sorry, how old are you?”

“Seventeen.”

“You're funny, Johnson,” he chuckled, like we were best friends. 

This guy was making it hard for me to not like him. 

I admit, I was taken off guard when he drove me to the airport. 

Nathanial threw his jacket over my shoulders, looking me up and down. “All right, you're good,” he ruffled my hair. “Luckily for you, kids our age literally wear anything. So, yes, you may look like you've been institutionalised, but my coat gives you a hipster vibe, y’know?”

I had no idea what he was talking about. He sounded like an Animal Crossing character. 

“I don't have an ID,” I managed to hiss out when he pulled me into the airport. It was surprisingly quiet for Christmas Eve. 

I expected to be questioned about my lack of passport and identity,  but Nathaniel, despite his age and lack of maturity, could easily pull me right through security with a flash of his badge. 

He gestured to a nearby coffee store, handing over way too many bills for a drink. 

“Flat white, and a bottle of water,” he said hurriedly, swiping through his phone. “Feel free to go crazy. Get as much as you want.”

I had almost 500 dollars pressed into my palm. 

So, yes, I went crazy. 

I almost turned and ran, taking the cash with me. 

But my Mom was dead. There was no home to go back to. 

I bought a double chocolate brownie hot cocoa to go, and turkey and stuffing sub, devouring both of them before I even left the store. Nathanial was waiting for me. 

He sipped his flag-white, leading me straight past the gate. When a guard stepped in front of us, he shot them a smile. “It's cool, we’re exceptions,” he said. 

The guard paused before nodding and stepping aside. 

“Have a good flight,  boys,” his lips broke out into a grin, “Oh, and happy holidays!”

Nathaniel winked at the man, smirking. “You too, Bobby!”

I was expecting first class seats, but instead, I was ushered onto a private jet. 

So, Nathanial was riiiiiich, rich. I had a bed as a seat. 

I slept for most of the flight, dreaming I was back in the YWPA, back on my blood stained mattress counting ceiling tiles. 

“So, how is it?”

Ethan loomed over me with his arms folded. The startling white of his shorts and tee made my eyes hurt. 

I didn't blink, stretching out my stiff legs. His voice was kind of muffled. 

“It's okay, I guess,” I said, “I had Five Guys.”

Ethan pulled a face, tipping his head back. 

“Ugh. Don't. I’m pretty sure they gave us recycled slop for dinner.”

I rolled onto my side. “Was it the chef's special macaroni and cheese?”

“Yep.” Ethan curled his lip. “They're trying to fucking kill us with the food.”

I nodded, enjoying my ex roommate’s company. Though I wasn't sure why he was pacing up and down. “The second I’ve built up this guy’s trust, I’ll get you guys out of there.”

I felt my heart squeeze, and I swallowed sour tasting puke. “Before you turn eighteen. I'll get you the fuck out of there.”

Ethan frowned, leaning closer, his brows furrowed like bugs. 

I blinked rapidly. 

Like tiny wiggling little furry bugs. 

“Dude.” I was pretty sure there weren't supposed to be two Ethan’s. The two Ethans leaned forward. “Can't you smell that?”

I could. 

It was potent, like bleach, suffocating my throat. 

Ethan jerked back, his eyes were wide. “That smells like–”

Reality slammed into me, but my eyes were glued shut. 

I knew exactly what it smelled like. 

I didn't even remember getting off of the plane. 

I  woke up, groggy, in the back of an SUV, my mouth full of metallic ick. 

I tried to move, and I couldn't, my arms reduced to sausages. 

I thought back to the water I sipped on the plane. How it tasted a little too bitter. 

“Did you fucking drug me?” I managed to get out in a hiss. 

I couldn't even panic, my body was paralyzed, my chest heaving, my heavy pants into thick leather seats were suffocating me. 

Nathanial’s laugh sounded like waves crashing into my skull. 

The car took a sharp turn, and I almost tumbled off of the seat. 

“It's just a small job, Johnson,” he said, “We’re counting on you.”

It took all my strength to drag myself to the window. 

I could see my breath coming out in clouds of white, tiny white flurries dancing across the pane. 

Snow. 

The drugs were fucking with my head. I slipped in and out of consciousness, dancing between the living and the dead. Ethan was sitting next to me, his head pressed against the window. “How do you even get out of shit like this?” he tried the door, slamming his fists against the door. 

“Locked,” he said. 

I managed a spluttered laugh. “No shit.” I caught myself. “What the fuck do I do?”

Ethan shrugged, his gaze glued to the snowstorm. “Maybe try diving out of the car?”

“When it's locked?!”

Before I could lecture Ethan on basic common sense, the real world slammed into me in waves of ice water– literally. 

Someone had opened my door, and I could feel the wind chill grazing the back of my neck. 

I opened my eyes when two muscled arms wrapped around me and yanked me out of the car. I couldn't stand, immediately falling limp in his grasp. 

“Come on, Johnson,” Nathanial’s voice tickled my ear. “We’re nearly there.”

I wasn't sure were ‘there’ was. I was up to my knees in snow, blurred white closing in on me from every angle. With my body immobile, Nathanial dragging me felt fucking dehumanising. He forced my head up, but it kept hanging, my thoughts dancing, my eyes flickering. 

“It's a simple job,” he said when I was more awake. 

In front of me was… something. 

It reminded me of a warehouse, a towering structure that almost looked like it was part of the storm. Nathanial pulled me further, chuckling. When I parted my lips to cry out, he promptly slammed his hand over my mouth. 

“Do the job well, Johnson, and we’ll think about taking you on full time.”

We reached a garage-like door, and with the click of a button, it was slowly gliding upwards. 

To my surprise, this place reminded me of a reception area inside a dentist. The floor was carpeted, a cosy lounging area filled with expensive looking sofas, and a TV playing what looked like an old cartoon. 

There was a desk, a short blonde wearing a Christmas hat sitting behind a laptop. 

“Nate.” she deadpanned, her gaze stuck to the laptop screen. “Did you get him?”

“No, Stella,” Nathanial’s tone pricked with sarcasm. “As you can see, I definitely don't have him.”

The girl nodded slowly. “Cooooooool.” she said. “Good talk.”

Ignoring Stella, Nathanial pulled me into an elevator. 

When the doors slid shut, I found my voice, pulling from his grasp, but my body was stiff and wrong. I dropped to my knees, shuffling back. “What the fuck is this place?”

The boy didn't answer, leaning against the door, his lips curled into a smirk. 

“It's a super special place.”

Something sickly crept up my throat. He was mimicking Mr Yellow’s words. 

My mother’s murderer. 

When the elevator slid open with a loud groan, the first thing I saw was intense clinical white light. 

The room reminded me of a surgical theatre that had long since been abandoned, flickering lights swinging overhead. I saw the first splatter of blood on the floor right in front of my feet. 

I've grown desensitised to blood over the years, but this was more than a splatter,  a dark crimson streak trailing all the way to the center of the room. There were four plastic chairs positioned in a circle. 

When I glimpsed velcro restraints hanging off of the arm rests, I felt my body start to twist and contort in a desperate attempt to escape. 

Two chairs were occupied by kids my age, metal helmets strapped to their heads; a strawberry blonde girl with her head bowed, her lips and chin stained scarlet. She was limp in the restraints, her body hanging forward. Opposite her was a guy, slumped over, hiding behind thick brown curls. 

There was a growing pool of red stemming around him. 

When he lifted his head, I had to fight back a cry. 

The guy’s eyes were pearly white, half lidded, all of the color drained from his iris. I recognized it. I had only ever heard of a kid’s power burning out through word of mouth. I had been taught that our abilities were like a muscle, and like a muscle, you could strain it. The first symptom of burnout was losing all the color in your eyes, but this guy was in the later stages. 

Judging by seeping red oozing from every orifice, he had already suffered multiple haemorrhages. 

My gaze found the helmet on his head. 

They kept bringing him back, forcing his body to revive again and again, purging his power for all it had. His lips were cracked, slick scarlet. I couldn't tell what his ability he possessed, or his level. Just that he was suffering. “You've gotta be… fucking… kidding me,” he sobbed. 

“Lucas, it's Christmas.” Nathanial mockingly scolded. “I told you about profanity.”

“Go fuck yourself.”

Nathanial forced me to stand. “All right, introductions!” he said cheerfully. “Guys, this is Johnson.” The strawberry blonde jolted in her chair, but she couldn't lift her head. “He's going to be helping us today.”

I cringed away when he patted me on the back. “Johnson! This is Luke and Tory! High level blues, and my favorite little helpers.”

Nathaniel shoved me into a chair, a metal helmet forced onto my head. Nathanial knelt in front of me, his eyes sparkling. 

Insanity, I thought dizzily. But there was something beyond that, a darkness shrouded in his eyes that he didn't want me to see. He pinned my wrists to the armrests, offering me a smile. “Your job,” he murmured in my ear. “Is *my* old job.”

He straightened up. “You see, we kept failing,” his expression twisted. “Every fucking year we failed, and more of us died. We couldn't do it. No matter how hard we tried, none of us were strong enough.”

I fought back, and with a simple twist of his wrist, my body was paralyzed. 

He was strong. 

“I was the best we had,” Nathanial sighed. “They took me from the YWPA in Vancouver. I was just a kid. Eight, maybe? I was dragged inside this room, forced into one of these fucking chairs, and my brain was fried over and over again, until I was numb,” he choked out a hysterical giggle. 

“I stopped feeling pain around the tenth or twelvth time those fuckers brought me back. But it was okay, because I could do it. I was the only one who COULD fucking do it, so why not use me for all I have?”

Was he… crying? 

Nathaniel swiped at his eyes with his sleeve, forcing a smile. “Anyway, then the demand grew, and it was suddenly so much fucking harder to control, or even lift off the ground. I was tortured in an attempt to strengthen my power, but I couldn't do it.”

His smile widened. “But you guys are,” he started to clap. “So much stronger than me! I mean, you're fucking amazing. Sooo much better than little old me. Luke, who turned his entire town into his personal minions, and Tory! Who went one step further, and expanded her power across an entire country! Making herself Queen!”

The blonde let out a whimper, her bound hands jerking. 

Nathanial laughed. “It's charmed rope, you fucking idiot,” he rolled his eyes. “Developed by the CIA in the early 2010’s when they realized a certain generation were gaining abilities they didn't understand and couldn't control.”

His eyes found mine. 

“Johnson.” He said. “What you did to get yourself in the YWPA was quite remarkable! Honestly, I bow down to you.”

“Please.” Luke  whispered, spitting blood on the floor. “I… I *can't* do…it.”

“Well, guess what? It's your lucky day, Lucas, because you have help now!” Nathaniel danced over to him, patting his helmet. When the boy lunged at him, he spluttered. “Ooh, bad dog! What did I fucking say about using your teeth?”

Lucas didn't respond, and I noticed the glint in Nathanial’s eyes. He wasn't just crazy. This asshole revelled in being in  control. “Soo, over the last few years, we’ve always focused on movement,” he twisted around, winking at me. “Now that, my fellow freakish children, was a mistake.”

A large wooden contraption was dragged in.

“Because why focus on movement?” Nathanial continued. “When we have something even better?”

I recognized what it was. 

The holiday lights strung across the back seat.  

The back, filled with sacks overflowing with wrapped gifts and toys. 

“Okay!” Nathanial shouted to someone above us. “Let's do a test run, all right? Everyone in position?”

“Nate.” Tory’s strangled cry sliced through the silence. She whipped her head back, her eyes rolling back to pearly whites. “You're going to kill us!”

Ignoring her, he turned to me. “How many people have you taken over, Johnson?” Nathaniel came closer, his eyes narrowing, lips curving into a spiteful smile. “How many minds can you force yourself inside?”

His question sent prickles of ice slipping down my spine. 

I hadn't answered that question in a long time. I was too scared to. 

“I don't know,” I managed to get out. 

“Aww, come on!” Nathanial cocked his head. “Maybe… a million?” he wagged his brows. “Two million?”

“I didn't mean to,” the words were choking my throat before I could stop them. I didn't realize how right the chair felt, the restraints, until I was reminded that I really was a fucking monster. “I was just a kid.”

Nathaniel’s expression softened, his lip twisting. “I know you were,” he said. “So was I when I told my pops to off himself.” he frowned. “Which begs the question,” he hummed. “You're a category blue at one of the highest levels, and yet the fuck faces back at YWPA decided not to toast you.”

It looked like he might continue, before a yell cut him off. 

“Nate, we’re all ready!” It sounded like Stella, from upstairs. “I just need your go ahead!”

Nathanial didn't respond for a moment. He slowly made his way over to me, fixing my helmet on my head, and checking my restraints. I thought he was sympathetic, or maybe he was, in his own fucked up way. But then he was running his hands through my hair, grabbing a fistful, and forcing me to look at him. 

His eyes terrified me. Not because of his ability, or his descent into madness. 

But because somewhere, deep, deep down, twisted in traumatised eyes filled with agony, I think part of him didn't even want to do this. 

“What you did, Johnson,” he whispered, “Fifteen years ago. I want you to do it again.” 

Turning to the others, the boy grinned. 

“How many children are on the planet, hmm? How many of those little fuckers believe in the big guy?”

I didn't notice it at first. 

The pain. It was numb first, dull, like a phantom nothing dancing across my skull. 

It was like being hit by lightning an infinite number of times. 

Each one hit the back of my head, burning a hole inside it. 

I didn't realize I was screaming, crying, choking on my blood  begging for mercy. 

When I was a kid, it almost felt like drowning. I didn't feel pain, instead, a stark numbness taking hold of me, and the crushing weight of names, wishes, memories, thoughts, bleeding inside me. 

Back then, I barely grazed their minds. I just gave them an order, and they did it. 

Then I let go, plunging down, down, down, and awakening in my mother’s arms. 

This time, I found each and every one. Ones that had grown up with me, and ones that were much younger, entangling myself with them. I could feel my brain coming apart, bleeding, running down my temples, and seeping down the back of my neck. “2.4 billion,” Nathanial said. “That's 2.4 billion minds to give one simple order.”

Fly. 

The word twisted on my lips, but that was more prominent inside my mind. 

Whatever was on my head, the helmet strapped to my skull, I could feel it moulding itself to my spinal chord, a screech ripping from my lips. 

I was burning, suddenly, my brain igniting, my body jerking left and right. 

I could already feel wet warmth running from my nose, my lips, my ears, every vessel inside me coming apart, a neutron star collision dancing across the backs of my eyes. The command was already inside my head. 

Our heads. 

I could sense and feel, almost touch Luke’s mind. 

Tory was harder, fading in and out, her body was already failing, already rejecting it. 

In front of me, the wooden contraption moved slightly, and Lucas’s head dropped. When it started to hover, Tory’s scream grew feral, animalistic, her cries growing into pleads, begging for death. 

The sleigh had taken flight, hovering above us. 

But I couldn't sense Luke anymore. That entangled string binding us together, had been cut. Through half lidded eyes, I think he was moving, his fingers still twitching under velcro straps. 

There was a gaping cavern of glistening gore where Tory’s brain was supposed to be, slimy pinkish grey splattering the ground around her chair. 

But the sleigh was flying, and despite the agony ripping through me, my body slowly shutting down, my mouth became a smile. 

I was aware of my head going limp, all of me slumping, my head tipping back. 

“That's right!” Nathanial’s voice was fading. “Make Santa flyyyyyyyyyy.”

Yeah, I thought, unable to resist a spluttered giggle. 

I was making Santa fly.

After three test runs, and then the real thing, spluttering on my last gasps of air. 

But, with the children's help, we really had saved Christmas. 

I was partially aware of Nathanial lifting me from the chair and dumping my body somewhere cold, somewhere where the ice cold chill was merciful on my soul. 

Dying felt weirdly comfortable, kind of like falling asleep. 

I always thought I would die on a surgical table, my body used for research. 

Or burned to ashes in the incinerator. 

Almost death was… cozy. 

“I'm, like, really fucking warm.”

Ethan’s voice pricked into my mind, and I found myself side by side with him. He was lying on something ice cold, his wrists strapped down. I didn't know what to say, so I rolled onto my back, “Well, I'm pretty sure I'm dying.” 

“But you're dying in a cool way.” Ethan chuckled. “Driving freakin’ Santa's sleigh. That's one hell of a way to go out, right?”

“Mmm.” I said. “Also, of hypothermia.”

I noticed where we were, sitting up, my head hitting the ceiling. 

Wherever we were was too narrow and claustrophobic. 

“Fuck.” I hissed, kicking the ceiling. “Where are you?”

“I’d… rather not answer that,” Ethan said, shooting me a sickly smile. “Can we just… talk?”

I pretended not to see the ignition of oranges getting brighter and brighter. 

Closer and closer. 

“Sure.” I said, swallowing a cry. “We can… talk.” 

‘Carlisle escaped today,” he murmured, after a moment. “So, expect the world to get a whole lot fucking crazier with her free.”

Those were words I really did not want to hear. 

Still, though. With Carlisle free, maybe anything was possible. 

The orange blur was growing bigger, and I squeezed my eyes shut. 

I had to wake up, to get out the snow. To live. Because I was going to freeze to death. 

But I didn't want to leave him. 

“Merry Christmas, Johnson,” Ethan murmured, his wide smile erupting into raging fire melting the flesh from his bones. “And happy fucking birthday to me.""",5,1734928122.0,TheCrypticCompendium,1,0.86,False

Or just being a “true” friends?,"Hellooo, it’s been a while since I last post on reddit and while im in the middle of job hunting, my adhd got the best of me. (Got distracted)

Anyway, let me start by saying, im not looking for advice or whatever, just posting coz again- these thoughts wont leave my mind alone. Feel free to say what you want though.

Hmmm. So I have these 2 cousins who happens to be in the same group of friends of mine. Lately feeling ko sobrang “observant” nila in everything I do. Im known to be a nonchalant friend so I didn’t notice it at first pero napaisip ako nung nag kwento ako sa other cousins ko and they said na they copy me a lot.

So naturally I asked what do they mean? Then nag site sila ng example and to my surprise- totoo din naman. Mind you, yung dalawang cousin/friend ko na yon is lowkey bullying me. I just dont care or give it much thought coz….idk, I just dont.

So eto nga, many months ago, I made a big girl purchase and bought and ip15pro - for work talaga coz my phone is lowkey dying (had ip11 for 3 years) and I used my phone a lot for phone calls and all. So after that purchase, nung next na coffee sesh namin ng circle ko, they saw I it. So naturally nag ask sila kung san nabili or hm and all. A week later they both have the same exact model. And lowkey I was shocked coz they said they do not have money pa. I found out that they used my friends cc. So ako naman wala lang sakin coz I cant be the only one using that model.

So ako naman nag try na itest talaga kung tama yung other cousins ko about copying me. (Spoiler alert- they are right)

From my hair color, hanggang sa pag papaayos ko ng kilay and pag papa whiten ko ng ngipin- lahat napansin nila talaga. Mind you, di ako nag popost ng kahit ano sa socmed about it pero yun ang unang comment nila pag nagkikita kita kame.
Sabi ko nga they are lowkey bully - one time nag comment yung isa sabi “nag ayos ka ng kilay pero di naman bagay sayo.” Then yung isa naman “ang baho naman ng perfume mo.” (I was using blck opium or santal33 that time) and they would say it front of other people. I really dont care tbh, I still continue using and doing whatever I want.

They are the same people who would invite me to their family trips and gatherings. And since pinsan ko sila sometimes I would give in coz they are so persistent. Then they would act like a saint in front of our relatives na binagbackstab nila pag di nila kaharap. In our relatives eyes they are a perfect pamangkin and apo, very courteous and all. While me, I dont really care about that “mano or beso beso act.” When they do it I would just stand in the corner and not do anything. Sometimes my grandma would forced one out of me.

 And they are the same people who would give me something coz I said it was cute. One time nasa mall kame and I saw a cute item but it was crazily overpriced- they bought it for me without any hesitations. Sometimes pag nagshare ako ng tiktok vids about food they would have it delivered in my house. Like wth. It was not my intention.

So yeah, im confused on how they act. There are a lot more I just got tired of typing. Like outfits and all, their mother is a bully as well, and a lot of plastikan moments in family gatherings. And even plastikan in my own circle.


So yeah, just sharing..

I am absolutely sure I did that because I coffee table just beside my bed (my bed is in the living room) and I remember specifically putting there because my laptop is kinda broken and I cannot really close it and I remember the struggle putting it on table very vividly. I wake up this morning ( I slept at 2:30 and woke up at around 6, so only 3-4 hour period). I see my laptop is in a couch a 3 feet away from the table. I asked around the house no moved it. no reason anyone would do it either. it would be so random and pointless thing to do. they aren't the type to play prank at all. so it's between me doing this on my sleep although I have no history of doing things in my sleep or literal ghost doing it. its so freaking weird man. Anyway just wanted share. what do you guys think? do you guys believe in ghosts?",1,1734928042.0,entp,3,1.0,False
