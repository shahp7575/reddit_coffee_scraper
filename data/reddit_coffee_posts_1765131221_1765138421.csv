1pgs9r7,https://i.redd.it/sp5ns9zdau5g1.jpeg,My dog passed away today,"I don’t know where to begin. This is the first time i’ve ever dealt with something like this and It’s the worst feeling in the world. His name was Oreo, he was 1 year old, 4 months before he turned two. Yesterday he was having an upset stomach so we decided to help him out and take him to the vet. We were giving him what they prescribed us and we thought everything was going to be fine. Today, I woke up at around 6 in the morning to my mom crying and I asked what had happened, and I saw my dog’s back legs curled up and he looked so fragile. I couldn’t believe what I was looking at. We took him to an emergency vet and that’s when they started telling us what they could do to him, X-rays, ultrasounds, etc. We were willing to do whatever it took to help him out. We asked if we could do an X-ray first because they started telling us we had to pay first so we can reimburse with our insurance. So we decided to pay with what ever we could so it could help us out even if it was a little. We went to Wawa because we wanted coffee until they called my mom saying he was feeling worse, and that surgery was something he needed immediately, we didn’t even know what had happened. We left everything and went to the hospital and they started explaining to us how something was wrong with his intestines because he possibly ate something he shouldn’t have. The problem is, he had surgery around May because he had a foreign body and that surgery costed us mostly everything. And even then he barely managed to survive. We started debating what we should do because supposedly for every surgery he has, the chances of survival slim down for him. 

We decided it was best to put him down, even if it would hurt us. I found it more relieving that he wouldn’t be in pain now. But I just can’t bear the fact that he’s gone. I feel so alone and he was the only one who looked at me with such love. Rest in peace, Oreo. I love and miss you so much. I wish I could forget this but I don’t think I ever will, how could I ever forget you? How do you get rid of this feeling?

It wound through groves of genetically engineered olive trees, symmetrical and silent. The gates—twenty feet high, matte black, forged from submarine steel—Vaulted ceilings framed by frescoes painted by men whose signatures had been erased from history. Silk curtains thick enough to stop bullets. Floors polished to mirror shine. No gold in sight—too vulgar. The wealth here was in silence, in stillness, in the air itself, which smelled faintly of orange blossom and old paper.On the second floor, behind six biometric checkpoints, a man stood barefoot on a Persian rug woven in the 14th century.He was known only as Matteo Bellandi.Matteo was seventy-eight.though He did not look it.His frame was lean but regal, every movement deliberate, economical. He wore cream-colored slacks and a hand-stitched Neapolitan blazer over a black silk shirt, unbuttoned at the throat. No jewelry. No watch. His skin was the color of antique bronze. Hair pure white, thick, combed back like a war general preparing for a final campaign. His eyes were black—not brown, not hazel, but obsidian—and impossibly still.A servant approached with a silver tray holding a porcelain demitasse.Matteo nodded.The servant bowed—lower than necessary—and vanished behind one of the silent-moving walls.Matteo sipped. The coffee had been harvested from a private hillside in Yemen, dried in the stomachs of civets fed only saffron and dates, brewed through spring water drawn from an aquifer below Mt. Fuji.

The air was cool, dry, and smelled faintly of vetiver and blood ink.One by one, the others arrived.A Chinese industrialist with teeth made of synthetic diamond.A Moroccan arms dealer in flowing white robes and lambskin slippers.A Balkan billionaire wearing the same suit as Matteo—same tailor, different posture.A Brazilian woman with fire-opal nails, rumored to have drowned her predecessor in a hydrotherapy pool.They spoke in murmurs. French, Russian, Urdu, Japanese. But when Matteo entered, the room fell into silence.He sat.And without raising his voice, said:""It begins.""Below the villa, in what appeared to be a wine cellar but was in fact a tactical crypt, a team of masked agents activated a system unseen since the last Tournament.Each invitation was handwritten—never printed.

Each envelope bore a seal in black wax pressed with a signet forged from meteorite.Thirty-two envelopes. Thirty-two destinies.They left the villa in velvet cases, loaded into armored Bentleys and nondescript jets, carried by emissaries who swore oaths in twelve languages. Some rode horseback through valleys. Some dived into frozen rivers to reach submarines.

1pgs0ey,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Cultural-Ad7385/comments/1pgs0ey/chapter_2/,Chapter 2,"**The city remembers him before he arrives.**

The city had a strange way of reacting to Hao.  
Streetlights flickered when he walked under them,  
as if the electricity hesitated,  
as if it needed an extra heartbeat  
to adjust to his presence.

People noticed him without realizing it.  
Their conversations thinned out just a little.  
Their eyes drifted.  
Their footsteps slowed.  
Like something in the air shifted  
whenever he stepped into a room.

But he didn’t notice any of it.  
Or maybe he did  
and simply refused to acknowledge it  
as if accepting his gravity  
would make him responsible for the way people orbited him.

I saw it, though.  
I saw the way waiters paused  
when he ordered coffee  
in that soft, low voice of his,  
as if they needed a second to remember  
how to breathe again.

I saw the way strangers looked at him  
like they recognized something in him  
that he didn’t want the world to see.

And I wondered  
was that how he looked at me?

We didn’t plan to see each other again after that rooftop.  
But some things don’t need planning.  
They just happen,  
like sunlight sneaking under a curtain  
or a song you forgot you loved  
playing in a store you don’t remember walking into.

It started small.  
A message at midnight:

“You awake?”

I was.  
He knew I was.

Then a picture  
a blurry shot of the city lights outside his window,  
the kind of picture someone sends  
when they’re trying to say something  
but don’t know the words yet.

So I replied:

“Where are you?”

And somehow, like gravity pulling two planets  
closer than physics recommends,  
we met again.

That night, Hao wore a hoodie  
that looked like it had survived more than he had.  
There were paint stains and frayed seams  
and a small burn hole near the wrist  
that he kept tracing with his thumb.

He didn’t talk much at first.  
He rarely did.  
Silence was his native language.  
Words were something he borrowed  
only when necessary.

But I learned to read the pauses.  
The way he looked down  
meant he was hiding something.  
The way he looked away  
meant he didn’t think he deserved to say it out loud.

So I asked softly,  
“What happened to your hand?”

He froze.  
Not like fear  
more like memory.

“Oh,” he said,  
barely audible.  
“It’s old.”

But I could see him reliving it,  
that burn mark carrying a story  
he wasn’t ready to tell yet.

After a long moment, he changed the subject.

“Do you ever feel,” he said, staring at the skyline,  
“like the city is too loud for your head  
and too quiet for your heart at the same time?”

I didn’t answer right away.  
Because that wasn’t a question.  
It was a confession.

So I said the only thing that felt honest:

“Only when you’re not around.”

He blinked  
once, slow, like he wasn’t expecting that,  
like the idea of someone finding him  
could actually be real.

And for a second,  
he almost smiled.

Almost.

We spent hours walking nowhere.  
Neon lights reflected in puddles like parallel worlds.  
Cars honked in the distance.  
A siren painted the walls red for three seconds,  
blue for three more.

“Why do you always look so tired?” I asked  
as we stopped by a convenience store  
with buzzing fluorescent lights.

He didn’t answer.  
Not directly.

Instead, he whispered,  
“I don’t sleep well.”

And then, after a beat:

“I dream too much.”

The kind of dreams that don’t go away  
when you wake up.

He didn’t say that part,  
but I heard it anyway.

It wasn’t until later  
much later  
that I learned what his dreams were about.

But in that moment,  
I just nodded  
and stood a little closer  
as we crossed the street.

The city carried us forward.  
The night didn’t judge.  
The lights didn’t ask questions.

But somewhere behind his eyes,  
something did.

Something dark,  
restless,  
and waiting.

Something that would eventually  
catch up to both of us.

But for now  
we were still walking.

Still breathing.  
Still pretending  
that the world couldn’t break things  
that hadn’t fully formed yet.

We were wrong.

And the night  
knew it before we did.

Rin

Her husband of three years, Cal, was home for the night. He only came home from the city once or twice a week. He’d crawled into their marital bed and pulled her right towards him, his hands sliding down her body caressively and his mouth hot on her n\*\*k.

“I’m home.” He murmured as he tugged at her sleepwear till it was gone. And then his mouth was moving down her body in heated kisses. Kissing both her brests in turn, tugging at her hardening nuts.

She sighed at first and then m\*\*\*\*d softly as his heated, hungry kisses turned her on. It never took him long to be all hard and wanting of her body. His mouth hit her core and she gasped out in pleasure in their darkened bedroom. Rin slid her hands into his hair and pushed her h\*\*s up to get more of him. She loved him and he was tasting her hungrily. And she gasped as he moved up to tease her cl1t “Do you want me, Rin?” he asked, even though he knew dаmed well she did want him. She was all hot and wet and well on her way to cu'mming for him.

He was dаmed go'od in bed, and she often slept exhausted afterwards. “Yes.” She m\*\*\*\*d without hesitation and felt his mouth move up her body in soft little nips to her skin. He bit gently at her n\*\*k just below her ear, something she loved; and he knew it, as he pushed himself inside of her, and she m\*\*\*\*d as he did so. She could even feel the curve of his smile against her n\*\*k as he took her in a long slow push, something he loved to do never rushed that first moment of taking her for himself.

He was not going to be in a rush tonight and she knew it. The man liked to take his time, and she would take all of him for as long as he wanted to have her. She moved with him, slowly and easily. Their bodies worked well together, three years of marriage and they both knew how to please each other. Take their own pleasure and increase it for the other.

He’d never been shy about sx, and she’d learned a lot from him. She was crying out for God later as she came, and he pushed himself up and looked down at her, smiled at her. “You know it’s not God giving you that or'gаsm.” He shook his head a little as he slipped from her body and tugged her over onto her stomach.

Rin smiled, she knew he wasn’t done and let him grab her wrists and push them up the bed to grab the edge. She was turned on just thinking about what he was going to do. Hold her down and take her all eagerly from behind. She just let him move her about the bed until he had her in the position he wanted, tucked under him like a little frog. “You ready, Rin?” He asked, and she could hear the smile with his murmured words, and she looked over her shoulder at him, her gorgeous husband and nodded at him.

“Yes.” She told him as he slid himself against her, and she heard him sigh, something else he liked sliding through her w\*\*\*\*\*\*\*s, half a dozen slides against her, and then he thrvst hard into her. He gripped her h\*\*s and pulled her hard back against him, and she pushed her h\*\*s up a little more and heard him g\*\*\*n “That’s it,” and he was then just taking her all eagerly, until she was once again crying out in or'gаsm.

She felt him cvm, and heard his grunt of satisfaction, before he slipped from her body and lay on the bed next to her. She shifted herself to lay down comfortably on her stomach, and turned her face to look at his profile, in the darkness of the room. It was perfect, she thought to herself absently.

“Sleep.” He murmured and smacked her on her b\*\*e backside.

She chuckled softly and closed her eyes, loved this man, her husband, and sometimes she could almost believe he loved her back. He could be playful in this bedroom of theirs at times. And it made her heart flutter, like it was doing right now. That little playful swat to her backside extended the intimacy between them.

It was hard for her to stay grounded when he was in this bed, or she was on his arm at some business or charity event. But that was why she was here. He’d married her to be on his arm, told her she was beautiful and would look good next to him. They had a marriage contract with no expiry date. He’d told her that one day he’d ask for a divorce, and she’d get a decent settlement from him.

All she had to do was stand next to him when it was required. She’d done that, worn many a beautiful dress while on his arm, and heard a few jealous comments from other women around them. Murmuring that she was a nobody and didn’t deserve to be by his side. They thought only someone from high society should be on Calvin Reeves' arm. They didn’t think she suited the position.

But she wasn’t some dumb bimbo that didn’t have a degree. She worked from home was all, just needed her laptop and an internet connection. Cal knew this had been the one to approach her, in fact, not the other way around. She’d been talking to a few of those in her field asking about living arrangements. Her lease was up, and she needed to find a new place to live. The owner was kicking her out of the apartment she’d lived in for three years.

Cal had offered her a home, this very house, in fact. She looked at him sleeping in the bed next to her and wondered, not for the first time, how she was going to handle the day he asked for a divorce, though she knew it wasn’t going to be anytime soon. He’d stated once when she’d been at his family home playing with his nieces and nephews ‘not until after at least three years of marriage.’ To his mother when she'd asked about them having children.

She’d looked at him. They’d only been together for a year at the time, and she’d not expected him to state anything about children ever. He’d smiled at her and stated “You can ask after our third anniversary. She’d turned away from him and not known what to say.

She wasn’t even allowed to k\*\*s that man. Not ever. It was the one thing he had demanded in their marriage agreement, that there would be no kissing during their entire marriage, no mouth-to-mouth kissing. Though he had expected it to be a proper marriage other than that. Marital sx was a yes as far as he was concerned, he’d told her simply ‘I like sx, I’ll want it, and you’re a grown woman who has needs. We can sort each other out.’

They’d been married three years now and still he’d kept to that rule. The one time she’d tried to k\*\*s him, pull his mouth to hers during sx, he’d actually stopped and gotten out of their bed and stated “we have rules about that Rin.” And to her complete shock he’d gotten dressed and left the house altogether, she’d tried to apologise told him she’d gotten carried away in the heat of the moment was all. He’d not seemed to care for her apology at the time, and so she’d just dropped the subject.

It had been a year and a half into their marriage, and she’d already fallen in love with him. That was why she’d wanted to k\*\*s him, to know what it was like to k\*\*s the man she loved. He was always nice to her, charming and gracious, very attentive when they were out together at a function, smiled at her and danced with her.

She’d stupidly fallen into that web he’d woven for the people he socialised with and worked alongside, and had also thought he was in love with her. How wrong she had been. She’d heard him not long after their second anniversary on the phone to his best friend Wil, also his lawyer.

‘The marriage suits me. I’ll divorce Rin when I find Mrs Right.’ It had hurt to hear those words, and she’d had to remind herself she wasn’t the love of his life, and that really good sx did not denote love; but it was so very hard sometimes. When he was here at the house, because he was all hands on with her when he was.

Every night was like tonight; when he’d crawled right into their bed and wanted her, know just how to please her and had done so twice, extended that intimacy just a little afterward even. She closed her eyes and sighed softly. It had been three years; their anniversary had been a week ago, and he’d wined and dined her, just like he had their first two wedding anniversaries, and a part of her knew it was all for show. But another part of her had loved every second of it, as she bought into her own lies about the type of marriage they had.
CH 2
Rin

She woke up alone in their bed, and she sighed to herself as she rolled over onto her back and looked up at the ceiling. Sometimes they had morning sx as well, and she kind of wanted that right now, as much as she knew she shouldn’t ever really want anything from her husband. She never asked for anything other than here in this bedroom, when he had his hands on her.

This house was more than enough: it was large and impressive and there was a housekeeper that came every Monday and Friday, before the weekend and after the weekend. She maintained the house every other day. It wasn’t that hard to do, it was just her that lived here.

Cal lived in the city in a penthouse apartment that was just over an hour away. She lay there in their bed and wondered if he’d left already. She glanced at the clock; it was just after seven, he had likely already gone. She always slept like the dead after sx. It relaxed her completely, though she too knew that Cal slept well after sx. Though he never bothered to wake her when he got up in the morning, nope, he'd shower, dress and leave, and she'd wake up alone 50% of the time.

She sat up and then got out of bed, showered and dressed for the day. Pulled on a pair of soft cream slacks and a simple silk singlet top in a soft purple, her wardrobe was a far cry from what it had been when she’d moved into this house. Even her u\*\*\*\*\*\*\*r was expensive, because Cal bought most of it. He would occasionally stroll through the door and hand her a bag, smile at her and say “I bought you something. Wear it for me.”

She pulled her long thick dark hair up into an easy ponytail and trotted down the stairs, and nearly came to a standstill upon seeing Cal sitting at the dining room table, reading the paper and а-'cup of coffee next to him. He looked at her briefly. “What?” he asked.

“Nothing,” she shook her head and went to make coffee for herself. “Do you want breakfast?” she offered. He rarely stayed for meals there with her.

“No, I’ll be off shortly. Got a legal appointment at nine,” he stated simply.

“Alright.” She nodded and made herself some toast to go with her coffee. Then she debated if today was the day to ask him. She was looking at him while he read the paper, as she held her coffee cup to herself. She didn’t have any family; she had been an orphan for as long as she could remember, moving from one foster home to another.

She enjoyed being married even though he wasn’t really here, if she was sick or injured, his name was there as her Next of Kin. She’d never had that before, not until they'd been married. She liked knowing that she could write his name there on those forms that required her to fill it in.

“What is it Rin? You're burning a hole in me,” he stated.

“Oh, sorry.” She took her toast and walked over to sit at the table. “I didn’t mean to stare.” She knew that was something he considered rude, but she couldn’t stop thinking about the fact that they’d just had their three-year anniversary. She could ask for a baby, and his child would be adorable.

“Rin?” he huffed and looked at her, folding the newspaper and getting up after another minute of her just staring at him. “Just tell me what you’re thinking. Do you want something?” he asked.

“N…no, nothing like that. I just, well, we’ve been married for three years now.” she kind of stammered a bit.

“Yes.” He nodded and drank the remainder of his coffee.

“You once told me, I, we, could have a baby after three years of marriage.” She bit the bullet and told him what she was thinking.

“Did I, I don’t recall that.” He frowned right at her.

“Yes, it was just after our first anniversary at your mother's house,” she told him. She recalled it very vividly.

“For mothers' benefit only then… Did you try and get pregnant last night?” he was suddenly frowning right at her now.

“No, I’m still on birth control.” She shook her head and looked at her watch. It was almost time to go and take it, she realised.

“Good, stay on it,” Cal stated and headed for the door. “There will be no baby inside this marriage.” He looked right at her. “I mean that, not inside this marriage, am I clear.”

“Yes.” She murmured as pain touched her chest. She watched him leave the room and thought about those very words ‘there will be no baby inside this marriage.’ ‘For his mother's benefit,’ but he’d looked at her that day and nodded at her, as if to tell her yes he meant it. They could have a baby together if their marriage lasted that long.

The man she loved, her husband, didn’t want to have a baby with her. When she left this marriage she would once again be alone. A part of her she knew, was so freaking stubid as to think he would want that with her. She was just a contract wife. A convenience for him to show he was a family man was all.

She got up and walked outside. Maybe it was time to ask for a divorce herself, either one of them could ask for it. There was an exit clause, though if she asked for it, she had to give up everything and leave with nothing. Her whole life was here now, revolved around that man.

She’d learned how to eat correctly, dance properly, and had etiquette lessons that first year as well. She even learned how to apply make-up and do her hair. All things that were needed to be his wife, to be seen on his arm. The only things she didn’t get in this marriage was an actual wedding, his heart, and to k\*\*s the man she loved. Everything else was hers until they got divorced.

She walked up to the cliff at the end of the property and sat down on the seat that was there. It was her favourite place to go and think. The wind would whip away her thoughts and clear her mind, and she liked the smell of the salty sea breeze as well. She felt more than a little stubid right at the moment; she should have held her tongue and she knew it. Should have known better than to ask to have a family.

She, and family; those two things she didn't think really mixed. Though his family liked her, and she got along with his mother and father, his sister all quite well. They were nice normal people, everyday average people like she was. Cal had not been born wealthy, he had created his own wealth at 25, made a name for himself and continued to do so to this day.

He ran his own company, enjoyed buying smaller companies and absorbing them, growing them, head-hunting the top computer programmers. She knew who they all were. That was her world. Though she worked remotely now, she could work anywhere in the world. She sat up there and looked over the ocean as she wondered where she would go when she got that divorce, and wondered if she should start looking now. He'd been unhappy with her question and she knew it; she recognised that expression on his face.

That one question could well be her undoing in this marriage. She sighed softly and looked out there at the ocean and wondered if one day she would have someone to call, son or daughter. Though she knew right now that it wasn’t going to be with Cal, that was now a given. “There will be no baby in this marriage.” She mimicked his words. But then she huffed at herself and got up. She wanted a baby, and she wasn’t getting any younger; She was already 28. Maybe it was time to move on, away from him and this life he gave her, but also at the same time, how could she? When she loved him.
CH 3
Calvin

He stood prowling around in Wil’s office. The man was on the phone, and it wasn’t even 9am yet. Cal was annoyed right this minute, his plan to ask for a divorce this morning had not happened. Rin had just completely blindsided him with that question about her wanting a baby with him.

“What’s got you all worked up?” Wil finally asked when he ended the call. The man had been watching him prowl around the room. “Did Rin lose it when you asked for the divorce?”

“No, I didn’t ask her for one,” he muttered.

“What? Why not? That was the plan,” Wil stated with a frown.

“I just couldn’t. She was happy last night, giggled at me and then this morning…” he sighed. “She asked me about having a baby.”

“What!” Wil stared at him now.

“Yeah, that was my reaction.” Calvin stated, “How could I ask for a divorce on the back of that conversation? She would think it was because she had asked for a baby. That’s just wrong, I’m not that cruel.”

“You say that, but that girl is in love with you, Calvin, you said so yourself. Told me she was all curled into you after your second wedding anniversary and murmured she loved you in her half-addled sleep state.”

“I know,” he muttered, and a slight smile touched his face at the memory of it. She’d been so cute, hugged into him patted his chest a little and sighed all softly, kind of dreamily murmured ‘I love you, Cal.’ She was the only one allowed to call him Cal. Everyone else called him Calvin or Mr Reeves.

“You should have asked for a divorce back then,” Wil muttered, ""now look at what you’ve got yourself into.""

“I wasn’t ready then.” He sighed and sat down on the man’s couch, and he hadn’t been. Yes, she was his wife, but it was contract marriage and he’d never looked at her in any other way than that. “I have to ask for it now, I just couldn’t do it today as planned.”

“Well, the sooner, the better, you know this. Even a no-contest divorce, which it will be, will take six weeks to settle and be finalized, so I suggest you start making those plans of yours come to light. Or she might just ask for it herself. Do you really want that?”

“No,” he muttered. “It has to come from me,” he nodded. “I’ll sort my end out today. I know where she dreams of going on holiday. It’s not half obvious her screen saver is the place she wants to go.”

“Then make the plans, you keep her passport, right?” Wil stated.

“Yes, it’s with mine. I’ll get it all sorted out, the flights and accommodation, the tours I know she’ll want to go on.” he nodded decisively. His mind was made up.

“It’s a lot of effort for a divorce, you know that right.” Wil shook his head.

“Mm, I’m the good guy, remember.” Though he didn’t feel like it right now, that girl had nobody, dumped in an orphanage and then raised in the foster system. He was surprised she was so well-adjusted. He shook that off and stood up. “When will the papers be drawn up?”

“When you list off what you want in them, I’ll draw it up today I got the time, no court today myself. What is she getting?”

“The house we share, and four million dollars should do it. Then that holiday all paid to her dream destination. I’ll make it first class, as well.” He would spoil her a little, she deserved it.

“Are you sure you want to do it this way, Calvin. You could simply...”

“No, it has to be this way. We have to get divorced, it’s the only way I see her being happy. She’ll understand my intent is to let her go, so she can be happy in the future.”

“It could backfire, you know, I’d be willing to bet there is a temper in that wife of yours.”

“Hmm, I’ve never seen it,” he shook his head. “She’s too sweet to yell and scream and pitch a fit. Likely just stare at me and mutter ‘right where are the papers.’” Or that was what he was hoping for. “I don’t want a big scene made out of this, keep it low-key and out of the papers.”

“So when are you going to do it? Will you be delivering the papers yourself? Or will I be the bad guy for your sweet-natured, loving wife?” Wil muttered.

“I understand you don’t like it, Wil, but we can’t go on in our marriage as it is. It’s not right and you know it. I can never tell her I love her back, so it’s time to get divorced.” He stated “If you can get everything drawn up by tomorrow, we’ll both go to the Cliffside Estate, and I’ll tell her I want a divorce and you, my friend, can hand her the papers.”

“Yay, I ain’t getting in the way if she tries to smack you one.”

“She won’t,” Cal stated, and she wouldn’t. She wasn’t that kind of woman.

“Getting her heart broken, she just might. I’ll have them ready to go in the morning. Best you sign them prior to going out there, so I can file them on the day, so that six-week wait starts right away.

Cal nodded and headed off to his own office. It was going to be a long and infuriatingly frustrating day, and he knew it. His mind was going to be distracted with those words she’d uttered this morning. A baby, she wanted to have a baby with him, inside a contract marriage. It was not the right thing to do, to bring a child into a marriage like they had.

So, no, he would not only not have a baby with her, he would divorce her to make sure she would understand him. He spent the day sorting out airfares and accommodation, checked on tours of the area and booked several of them: a vineyard tour, a hot air balloon ride, horseback riding on the beach. A dinner cruise on a nice yacht and a spa day, he booked the best hotels and made sure there were luxury transfers.

All the things she’d talked about with his own mother, all the things his mother told him he should do with her,” take your wife on vacation son, make it romantic and relax, enjoy each other.” He knew what that meant. She wanted him to have a baby with his wife. Come home pregnant is what she meant.

He looked at the list of things, and printed out the itinerary. It was quite extensive, a full month-long holiday in Italy. She would really like that, she would see he’d made the effort to give her something she was interested in, her dream destination. She’d not had a holiday in the three years they’d been married, his schedule kind of hindered that. He always had events, whether they be business or charity, here or in other states or outside the country.

He put it all together and got her passport from the safe, flipped through it. She’d been on two business trips with him, and he’d bedded her relentlessly those days they’d stayed together. His wife was beautiful and had a smile that could melt any man's heart. That was why he needed a divorce.

He wanted her to be truly happy, and she could not be that inside their contract marriage, something that was full of rules and stipulations, things he kept in place to protect her and himself. Not that it had seemed to help protect her, she’d still managed to fall in love with him. It was time to end their sham of a marriage in favour of happiness and contentment.

She wasn’t going to like it, be heartbroken, but it was for the best. He couldn’t stay in that contract marriage if he couldn’t give her what she truly wanted, and he could not.
CH 4
Rin

She was out the back of the house, sitting in the shade of a large tree on a blanket. The morning was sunny, but cool, and the breeze coming off the ocean was gentle. She was working outside this morning, being cooped up in that big house for the past two days without so much as a single word from Cal, had kind of felt suffocating.

She understood he was mad at her, and that those words he’d spoken were in fact the truth. The manuscript she was working on had turned dark and emotional, to match her mood. Though she had used those feelings she’d had of heartache and loneliness to add a new twist to the tale she was weaving.

Even now she was typing away out here, she’d not really slept all that much last night, she had tossed and turned and, in the end gotten herself up to write, because it was the one thing that could shut her own emotions off or pour them into her writing. She turned her head at the sound of a car coming up the driveway and frowned instantly.

Cal never came home at this time of the day. She wasn’t even dressed appropriately, she was just sitting out here in an old pair of shorts and a tee-shirt. She did always try to dress nicely when he was around. These were clothes from her old days. She’d been feeling nostalgic and so had rummaged through her old clothes, to be her old self. She had a feeling she was about to be shoved back into her old life, and so she was dressed to match her mood.

She turned back to her work. It was unlikely he was there to see her. At this time of the day, he likely needed something from his office; he did have one here, though she never went in there. He’d told her once not to, and had also pointed out the camera that was in there. It was motion activated and would alert his phone if she did go in there.

She’d not really cared about it, didn’t work in his industry, though she knew a fair few of those that worked in his tech department. She had a computer science degree and could, if she so chose to, could go and sit in her office inside his building in the city and work all day long. She and the team she worked for, had been absorbed by C.R. Technology just before he and she had gotten into the marriage contract; that was how he’d come across her. She was the one that checked for bugs and glitches in the gaming programmes they made.

She was smart technology-wise, just not so smart in the emotional department. She had given her heart to the man she was married to, and she shouldn't have. She caught movement in her peripheral vision and turned to look, to see not only Cal coming this way but his friend and lawyer, Wil, as well. Her eyes moved to the envelope in Wil's hand; It was large. Denoting a contract of some sort.

Here it comes she told herself, and wondered how she was going to explain herself to the team, that she’d gotten divorced, when everything in her life looked wonderful, and that she had an amazing husband. They were a team of girls, and they all thought she was so very lucky to have the love of a man like Calvin Reeves.

Little did they know she did not have his heart, and as she watched him walk towards her, Rin finally realised it was true. He may have hers, but she would never have his. It was all just a show for the public, something to keep his public image clean and family-orientated.

She closed her laptop so that no prying eyes would see what she was working on. It was nothing to do with his company. Not even Cal knew she had a second career. She'd needed to keep that part of her life solely for herself, for the day she got divorced and she was once again all alone.

She’d never told anyone, she'd always worried it would be a complete and utter failure. Though it was not, it had taken off really well a year and a half ago, and if she was completely honest with herself, she’d kept it from Cal on purpose, because she knew this day would come, and she needed something to fall back on.

She had a secret career under her pen name Marilyn Riddley. Her romance novels sold quite well, and she now had two books in print. The rest were all online, but she had made it, and could actually earn a living from it. Not be super wealthy, but enough to sit at home and work on the next one, instead of having to go into the office and work in the computer lab.

When their divorce was finalised, she would leave her life as Marrin Reeves and become Marilyn Riddley, move away from this city, where everyone would know her as the ex-wife of Calvin Reeves. She would move to some place where no one would know her and she could live her life small and peacefully, and never have to hear his name or see him with another woman on his arm, because she knew that would just be painful for her to look at, read about in the papers or see online.

She was going to have to leave his company, it was part of the marriage contract. When they divorced, she would move on from the company so as not to cause gossip or awkwardness for him. Though he had told her he’d personally write her a glowing reference for the work she’d participated in within his company. So it would be easy for her to get another job in her field.

He might be able to see her in her field at those conferences without issue, but she doubted she’d be able to look at him with some other woman on his arm, and not feel uncomfortable inside her chest. If he had the audacity to k\*\*s another woman in front of her, she’d likely lose it completely, even though those l\*\*s of his were never to be hers, not for a single second. That didn’t mean she didn’t think about how it would feel to have him k\*\*s her.

Would it be all soft and sensual? Or would it be all hard and demanding? Or would it be light and playful even? She wanted to experience it all, but would never get to. No, that was only for the woman he would love, Mrs Right.

Her heart ached as she looked at him. He was dressed as immaculately as always; a dark blue suit, white dress shirt and a blue and gold tie. He had a hand in his pants' pocket as he walked across the lawn towards hers with Wil next to him. She saw him chuckle softly and even Wil chuckled right after him.

A small part of her clung to the hope that she was wrong. This was not about them getting divorced at all, because how could he be smiling and laughing with Wil? If they were here to serve her with divorce papers. That was not a funny matter, but a serious matter.

She stood up to greet them, and she saw his eyes look over her outfit, and a frown marred his handsome face; he didn’t like her wearing this type of clothing. It was not something he’d bought for her or approved of her wearing. She smiled at him like she always did. “Cal, you’re not normally here at this time of the day.” She stated.

“Is that why you’re dressed like that?” he asked right back, and she could hear the disapproval in his voice. “Didn’t I purchase you proper summer clothing?”

She looked down at her old clothes and half smiled. “I’m going to do some gardening. These are appropriate wear for that.” She looked back to him.

“Hmm, I suppose they are only good for getting dirty.” He nodded and looked right at her. “It’s time to get divorced, Rin,” he told her. There was no hesitation in his words. “If you could sign the papers today, I’d appreciate it. It will take six weeks for the finality of it to come through.”

And there it was. She’d not been wrong, and she just knew that one question she’d stupidly asked him had brought this about. Why oh why couldn’t she have kept it to herself? Said nothing and ignored her need to have a baby with the man she loved. Monumentally stubid, she told herself as she stood there staring at him. Wondering if telling him she was sorry and hadn’t meant it would work to keep him by her side. Though it was only a fleeting thought, she knew he'd made up his mind.

Her eyes moved to Wil as he opened the envelope he was carrying and pulled out the documents inside it. It wasn’t just a simple piece of paper, it looked to be quite extensive. She could well imagine there was a non-disclosure agreement there as well, for her not to ever talk about their marriage contract.

“It’s a no-contest divorce as per our marriage contract,” Cal stated. “I have also organised for you to go overseas on a holiday. You’ve not been able to take a vacation in the past three years, that we were married. I’ve accounted for that and an all-expenses paid trip has been organised for you, as part of the divorce agreement.”

1pgrrnu,https://i.redd.it/edad0cos6u5g1.jpeg,Seven Years a Mistress,"The last night Arabelle Greyle spent with Benjamin Chantler, he lost control more than ever.
Her fingers brushed against the ring on his hand—and in that instant, memories came flooding back.
Just a few days ago, she'd seen the gossip online: Benjamin was about to marry the daughter of the Shelton Group's CEO.
Noticing she was distracted, he leaned down and gave her a long, intense kiss.
With her mind all foggy from passion, he slipped a bank card into her bra.
""Just be good for me. I'm getting married next month. Let's end this.""
Arabelle nodded obediently. ""Okay.""
Seeing that she didn't cry or make a scene, Benjamin frowned instead. ""You okay?""
Arabelle gave him a light and comforting laugh. ""I'm good.""
She had long moved past the point where his actions could hurt her.
Everyone who knew them could see that Arabelle was crazy about Benjamin, almost to the point of obsession.
She'd been chasing him since she was 18.
Right after graduation, she joined the Chantler Group and became his secretary.
During the day, she helped him out at work without a hitch. At night, she was right there in bed with him.
Whenever trouble came up, she'd jump in front of him like a shield. When it came to parties and drinks, she'd step up to take shots for him.
She always carried three notebooks in her bag filled with all his likes and dislikes. The moment he gave her a look, she knew exactly what he needed.
For seven years, she followed him—without a title, without a promise. Only recently had people begun to change their tone.
Instead of calling her foolish, they'd smile and ask when the wedding news would come.
No one could believe she'd just sit back and watch him marry someone else. Not even Benjamin.
What they didn't know, though, was that a week earlier, Arabelle had already said yes to her parents' request to head back to her hometown for a blind date.
\*\*\*
She first met Benjamin when she was 18.
One day, she got a call from her mother.
""Belle! Your dad was in a car crash. He's in the ER— it's bad. You need to come home right now... before it's too late.""
Arabelle's mind went completely blank.
In a panic, she rushed out and accidentally crashed into Benjamin's car.
Luckily, he hit the brakes just in time. She wasn't hurt too badly. After getting up, she limped toward the hospital as fast as she could.
Benjamin stopped her. After asking what happened, he made a quick phone call and then drove her there himself.
When they got there, the hospital director quickly led in the best team for surgery—and somehow managed to bring her dad back from the brink of death.
Arabelle and her mother held each other tight, their faces wet with tears of joy.
Through her blurry eyes, she spotted Benjamin standing a little way off, quietly thanking the hospital director.
That was when she realized he was the one who'd asked the director to come.
At that moment, the young man in the light, calm and serious, felt like a god who'd appeared in her life.
At first, all Arabelle wanted to do was thank him.
That was why she'd been by his side, trying to find small ways to show her appreciation for what he'd done.
After graduation, she joined the Chantler Group and somehow ended up sleeping with him one night. Then she became his personal secretary.
Over time, her feelings changed.
During those rare moments when he showed her kindness, she found herself having desires that felt a bit too greedy for comfort.
It was only a month ago that Benjamin suddenly started acting really cold toward her.
Feeling uneasy, she hesitated for quite a while.
After one close moment together, she finally gathered the courage to ask carefully, ""Mr. Chantler, did I do something wrong?""
Benjamin's icy, serious eyes narrowed at her.
After what felt like forever in silence, he replied, ""I'm just kind of tired of this.""
Arabelle's face went pale. Under his indifferent stare, she hurried away in embarrassment.
That same day, Benjamin left for a business trip overseas. For the first time, he didn't take her—his personal secretary—along with him.
The next day, she stumbled upon the news that he was engaged to Adelina Shelton.
When he returned a week later, there was an extra wedding ring on his finger.
That was when it hit her.
All good things have to come to an end, and it was time for her to say goodbye to Benjamin.
Benjamin had already moved out, leaving her the apartment where she'd lived for seven years.
Arabelle quickly reached out to a real estate agent to put it up for sale.
The apartment was in a great location, and she priced it way lower than what others were asking. The agent marketed it as a top listing, and that very night, someone came by to check it out and put down a deposit.
After signing the contract, the agent beamed at her. ""Ms. Greyle, the buyer is paying in full! We should wrap everything up in about a week.""
Arabelle paused for a second, then smiled and nodded.
""Alright, thanks!""
After the agent left, she started packing up the apartment.
The little lucky cat figurine on the shoe cabinet had been there since her first day moving in.
Benjamin used to joke about that cat figurine. But as soon as she turned around, he pushed her against the shoe cabinet and kissed her like he couldn't get enough.
He playfully nibbled on her earlobe while his deep voice rumbled with laughter.
""You believe this little thing can bring you luck? I can do a better job than it.""
The living room carpet was something he'd spotted at a mall during one of their overseas trips together.
He just whipped out his card and bought it right then and there. It took over half a month to arrive from across the ocean.
Once she unpacked it, he started unbuttoning her clothes with a mischievous glint in his eyes.
""When I first saw this carpet, I thought it looked very comfy to lie on.""
On the single-seat couch in the corner, he had a rare moment of softness. Once, he held her in his arms when she was sick and comforted her gently.
The razor in the bathroom was the first gift she ever gave him, and he used it for years.
On the title page of ""Business Warfare Strategies,"" the book on the far left of the shelf, there was a quick sketch of her that he drew on a whim. It was not perfect but really captures her essence.
Seven years felt like such a long time.
Long enough that even someone as proud and distant as Benjamin made unforgettable memories with her all over this place.
Arabelle went through her things, keeping some and discarding others.
But eventually, she just collapsed into the mess of scattered items, crying uncontrollably.
Chapter 2
She cried all night.
The next morning, she put some ice on her eyes for half an hour and then slathered on a thick layer of foundation. It was only then did her eyelids finally stop looking so puffy and red.
She pulled out the resignation letter she had written ages ago and headed straight to the office.
As soon as she sat down at her desk, she noticed all her coworkers in the department giving her those subtle, sympathetic looks.
Before Arabelle could ask what was up, Benjamin's office door swung open.
Adelina stepped out.
She was rocking a fancy custom dress with flawless makeup. She carried herself with that effortless elegance of someone from a wealthy family, moving around the office like she owned the place.
Arabelle finally figured out why her coworkers were giving her those sideways looks.
Everyone thought she was going to be the future wife of their boss.
But just like that, Benjamin got engaged, and her situation became awkward.
When Adelina spotted her, though, she didn't seem upset at all.
With a sweet smile on her face, she handed over an invitation to Arabelle and warmly invited her.
""Good morning, Ms. Greyle! Benjamin and I are having our engagement party in a week. I came here just to hand out invitations.
""You've worked with Benjamin the longest. We'd love for you to join us!""
Arabelle quickly put on a polite smile and took the invitation from Adelina with both hands.
""Congratulations to you, Ms. Shelton, and Mr. Chantler.""
Adelina kept her smile as she leaned in a bit closer, lowering her voice to a whisper just for the two of them.
""I heard you thought you could marry into the Chantler family? How ridiculous.
""Benjamin was just using you to practice. Otherwise, how would he keep me happy after we're married?
""Open your eyes and see how big the gap is between us. Just give up on this silly dream already.""
She maintained that smile throughout, acting all friendly. Anyone who didn't catch their chat would have thought they were just sharing some light gossip.
Arabelle stayed calm on the outside, but her fingers tightened around the invitation until her knuckles turned white.
She understood why Adelina was acting like this—who would want their husband's ex hanging around? Still, there was an uncomfortable knot tightening in her chest.
Arabelle pressed her lips together and decided to lower herself even more.
""Don't worry, Ms. Shelton. I know my place.""
There was a cold edge behind Adelina's smile.
""I hope so. But honestly, I've never been one to bet on whether people know how to behave.""
In the next moment, she grabbed Arabelle's hand and suddenly stumbled backward. Before Arabelle could react, Adelina fell straight to the floor.
After letting out a sharp cry of pain, she looked up at Arabelle with wide eyes.
""Ms. Greyle, I invited you to our engagement party. Why did you just push me down?""
The office door swung open, and Benjamin stepped out with long strides.
When he saw Adelina lying on the ground, he rushed over to help her up.
""Adelina, what happened?""
Adelina looked up at him, her eyes red and puffy. ""I was just giving Ms. Greyle the invitation for our engagement party and asking if she could come. But out of nowhere, she got upset, pushed me away, and told me to leave.""
Benjamin shot a glance at Arabelle, his eyes cold.
Arabelle frowned and quickly tried to explain, ""I didn't...""
But Benjamin cut her off sharply.
Turning back to Adelina, he asked, ""What kind of status does she even have? Is it really worth you coming all this way just to invite her?""
The room went silent. His harsh words hit Arabelle like a punch in the gut for a moment.
Adelina paused for a second but then quickly put on a smile and playfully whined at Benjamin.
""But she's your chief secretary! I just thought I'd help you keep talented people around.""
Benjamin scooped her up into his arms and headed toward the office.
As he walked, he said with a bit of authority, ""You're the future wife of this company's boss. No one's more important than you.
""Where did you twist your ankle? Let me take a look.""
Arabelle stood there, frozen with a blank look on her face, watching them walk away.
Adelina was really rushing. She couldn't even wait for Arabelle to hand in her resignation letter. But honestly, with such clumsy acting, how could Benjamin not see through it?
Still, he chose to have her back.
They were all adults here. Fairness couldn't be obtained just by throwing fits or crying about it.
A heavy feeling settled in Arabelle's chest as she calmly pulled out her resignation letter.
Just when she was about to go in and ask Benjamin to sign it, he suddenly walked out.
He stood tall and straight, his clothes fluttering a bit as he moved. His long fingers tapped lightly on her desk, and he said bluntly, ""Adelina doesn't want to see you. So just resign.
Benjamin's cold, hard gaze showed no emotion at all.
Arabelle's heart raced for a moment, and she tightened her grip on the resignation letter she'd prepared that morning.
After seven years of working hard at the Chantler Group, she never thought she'd be leaving like this in such a humiliating way.
A bitter smile crept onto her face as she nodded slowly.
""Alright.""
Her calm acceptance with no tears and no shouting, sparked a surprising bit of annoyance in Benjamin's chest.
He frowned. ""Just leave today. I'll have the finance team give you double what you're owed.""
Arabelle smiled faintly. ""Got it. Thanks, Mr. Chantler.""
Benjamin turned and walked away without looking back.
Chapter 3
Arabelle sat back down at her desk, ripped up the resignation letter she no longer needed, and submitted her resignation through the company system.
Maybe Benjamin had already given HR a heads-up. Her resignation got approved almost right away, and it was quickly sent over to Benjamin for his final confirmation.
Not long after that, a notification popped up on Arabelle's screen. ""Your resignation application has been approved.""
At the same time, a large sum of severance pay landed in her bank account.
She hurriedly packed up her stuff. As she walked out with her things in hand, she passed by Benjamin's office.
The door wasn't fully shut. There was just a little crack.
Through that gap, she spotted Benjamin inside, head down as he looked over some papers. Adelina was sitting next to him, enjoying a dessert.
She took a bite herself and then scooped another spoonful of dessert and offered it to Benjamin. ""You've gotta try this. It's so good!""
Benjamin took a bite of the cake with the spoon that Adelina had used without hesitation. ""It's pretty good.""
Arabelle glanced at his face and gave a wry smile.
On her first day at work, she found out that Benjamin had two hard-and-fast rules.
First off, he was a germaphobe and never shared utensils with anyone.
At first, he wouldn't even kiss her in bed.
Their first kiss only happened because she was running a high fever. Her mind was all foggy from it, and when she talked to him, their lips accidentally brushed against each other. She went pale with shock, but he just leaned down casually and kissed her.
Back then, Arabelle thought she was special to him.
Secondly, he really didn't like sweet stuff.
After being with him for seven years, she had never seen him touch anything sugary. Even when she treated herself to some cakes now and then, he wouldn't even look at them.
She had memorized all his likes and dislikes. She filled up three thick notebooks with notes because she was scared that even the tiniest mistake would annoy him.
But it turned out her ""secret rulebook"" was just a big joke.
When he met the right person, he was willing to tolerate everything.
So, pulling out that heavy notebook, Arabelle let out a laugh at herself before tossing it in the trash without thinking twice and walked away.
Benjamin looked up from his papers. Through the crack in the door, he caught a quick glimpse of someone familiar rushing by, and for a moment, it threw him off.
When Arabelle got home, she told a few friends that she had decided to quit her job and head back to her hometown. They made plans to grab dinner the next day.
She thought she'd never see Benjamin again in her life. But surprisingly, as she followed the waiter toward their private room, she spotted someone familiar on the second floor out of the corner of her eye.
It was Benjamin and his friend leaning against the railing, smoking away.
With his back turned to her and a faint red glow from the cigarette between his fingers, there was an unexpected touch of loneliness about him.
Arabelle only stole a glance at him before looking down quickly, pretending not to notice him.
But then she heard Benjamin talking to someone else carried over by the wind.
She could make out his friend's voice asking, ""Are you really thinking about marrying Adelina? Ms. Greyle has been around for so long. We all figured you'd end up with her.""
Benjamin's tone was flat. ""I never thought about it.""
His friend chuckled and teased, ""Well, aside from her family not being the best, Ms. Greyle is gorgeous, knows how to handle things, and has been totally devoted to you. After all this time, you've never felt anything for her?""
Benjamin went quiet for a couple of seconds. Then his cold, indifferent voice floated over to her on the breeze.
""How could I ever let myself catch feelings for a plaything?""
Arabelle froze. The blood drained from her face.
When she caught the waiter's curious gaze on her, she dug her nails into her palm and slowly followed along.
She ate without tasting a thing. Her friends were all college roommates who knew about her feelings for Benjamin over the years.
When they found out she was heading back home, they felt both happy for her and sorry for what she'd gone through. The group hugged each other tightly and cried together.
After the lively crowd thinned out, Arabelle watched as her friends got picked up one by one by their husbands or boyfriends. Once again, she was left all alone.
She tightened her grip on her bag strap and was about to head out when her phone suddenly rang.
Glancing at the screen, she saw it was Benjamin calling. She reached to hang up, but accidentally hit ""answer"" instead.
Frowning and ready to end the call right away, she heard a voice on the other end that she didn't recognize.
""Hi there, is this Ms. Arabelle Greyle?""
Arabelle paused for a second. ""Yes, this is her.""
The caller replied politely, ""Ms. Greyle, Mr. Chantler has had too much to drink. Could you come pick him up? We're at...""
Benjamin was never the type to go overboard with drinking. Given his status, not many would even think about pushing him to drink more.
""So how did he end up drunk?""
Arabelle didn't really question why the waiter called her. She just replied in a distant voice, ""Sorry, but I can't come right now. Please get in touch with his fiancée to pick him up.""
As soon as she hung up, she heard the waiter on the other end gasp in shock.
""Mr. Chantler! Mr. Chantler, what's wrong? Mr. Chantler!""
The call ended abruptly.
Arabelle's expression changed instantly, and panic washed over her like a wave. Before she could fully wrap her head around what was going on, her body had already taken off toward the second floor.
She burst into the private room and shouted anxiously, ""Benjamin!""
When the door to the private room swung open, Benjamin was slouched in his chair, looking all dark and moody. His right hand was covered in blood, bright red and shiny.
Broken glass was scattered all over the table and around his feet.
The waiter stood nearby, fidgeting with worry on his face.
But Benjamin seemed completely unfazed, like he wasn't even the one hurt.
When he heard her voice, he turned to look at her, his eyes deep and shadowy.
His voice came out rough, with a hint of something almost like grievance.
""Didn't you say you weren't coming?""
Chapter 4
Arabelle let out a quiet sigh. ""Let me take care of your wound first.""
Benjamin didn't say yes or no.
He was acting a bit strange. As Arabelle got closer, she caught a strong smell of alcohol on him and figured he must have been pretty drunk.
He probably forgot that she wasn't his secretary anymore.
The waiter, looking relieved, quickly went to fetch the restaurant's first-aid kit.
Having been by Benjamin's side for years, Arabelle had made it a point to learn quite a bit about first aid for all sorts of unexpected situations, so she knew what she was doing.
She leaned in closer and when she saw his palm—a messy mix of blood and flesh—her brows knitted together instinctively.
""It might sting a little, just hang in there.""
""Okay.""
Arabelle carefully pulled out the pieces of glass stuck in his palm, put some medicine on the cut, and then, almost like she was calming a child, instinctively leaned down and blew gently on it.
The man sitting at the head of the table watched her gentle profile with focus, his throat gulped.
When she finished wrapping his hand neatly, she tied a small, careful bow to hold it all together.
She looked up at him with a smile. ""Mr. Chantler, all done with the bandaging...""
But before she could finish her sentence, Benjamin suddenly reached out with his good hand, grabbed her jaw, and leaned down to kiss her.
His kiss was hot and intense, full of emotions that were hard to explain.
Arabelle's eyes went wide, and she stared at him in shock.
In the next second, she didn't think twice before shoving at his chest with both hands.
But it was her who ended up losing her balance and falling to the floor. Her gaze stayed locked on him, filled with panic.
""Benjamin...""
He looked down at her, his voice rough. ""Arabelle, you know... you don't have to go.""
A sudden sharp pain shot through her chest.
He had pushed her away just yesterday, and now he was saying she could stay?
Just a moment ago, he even told someone else that she was just a toy for him to play with.
She could see the desire in his eyes clearly, which only made this whole situation feel totally absurd and ridiculous.
""Benjamin, we're done. You said so yourself.
""If you keep hanging onto me like this... I might start thinking you've actually fallen for me.""
Benjamin's pupils shrank suddenly, and the emotions in his eyes vanished right away, turning icy cold.
Out of nowhere, a phone rang.
Arabelle glanced over and saw Adelina's name pop up on the screen.
She raised her voice a bit. ""Mr. Chantler, your fiancée is trying to reach you.""
Benjamin looked down at the phone screen, his face going completely stone-cold.
""Get out.""
Arabelle quickly got up from the floor and rushed out of the private room.
As soon as she stepped through the door, she heard what sounded like a phone being smashed behind her. She hesitated for just a moment but didn't look back and just kept walking straight ahead.
Outside the restaurant, she quickly flagged down a taxi and hopped in.
As the car pulled away, she caught sight of the driver's unsure glance in the rearview mirror.
Arabelle blankly pulled out a mirror and took a look at herself—only then did she notice that Benjamin's kiss had smudged her lipstick, leaving marks on the corners of her mouth. She looked completely disheveled.
In a daze, she remembered that one time when Benjamin hardly ever stayed over at her place.
The next morning, they got up together to head to work. Arabelle was huddled by the vanity, rushing through her makeup to save some time. It wasn't until she was almost done that she realized Benjamin had been standing right behind her without her even noticing.
Feeling playful, he picked out a tube of lipstick for her and gestured like he wanted to put it on for her.
Worried about being late, Arabelle didn't think twice. She pouted her lips and went along with him as he traced the shape of them.
With two fingers from one hand, he lifted her chin to get her to look up at him. With his other hand, he held the lipstick and carefully applied it to her lips.
Even after he was done putting on the lipstick, he didn't let go of her jaw.
A bit of confusion flickered in her eyes as she met his gaze. She noticed that his expression was serious and intense, and he was looking right at her.
""What's up? Is it not finished yet?""
As soon as she said that, he kissed her, cutting off any further words.
When Benjamin finally pulled back, the lipstick he'd just put on had smudged all over—messy but somehow still sweet and tempting.
Arabelle let out a quick gasp and rushed to fix her swollen lips.
In the same mirror, the guy who caused it all was grinning like he found it hilarious.
As he casually wiped away the red lipstick smudge from the corner of his mouth, he chuckled in a deep voice.
""Weren't you the one who made that pouty face first, asking for a kiss?""
When she finally snapped back to reality, Arabelle looked at her reflection in the mirror—tears were already streaming down her cheeks.
Chapter 5
The next day, as soon as Arabelle woke up, she got a message from an old coworker.
""Arabelle, I found a necklace at your old desk. Do you still want it?""
Her colleague even sent a photo with the message.
Arabelle clicked on the picture and realized it was the birthday gift her mother had given her two years ago—a piece she had always loved.
She figured she must have left it behind in her rush to leave when she quit. So, she quickly made plans to meet her former coworker for lunch.
Arabelle got there early. She just arrived at the restaurant she used to go to during workdays and ordered some food when suddenly, out of nowhere, she spotted Adelina walking over from not too far away.
Gone was the sweet smile that Adelina usually wore. Instead, her face looked cold as she headed straight for Arabelle.
Arabelle couldn't help but frown. ""You...""
Before she could finish her sentence, Adelina suddenly raised her hand and slapped Arabelle hard across the face.
Along with the slap, Adelina shouted at the top of her lungs, ""You bitch! You've already been kicked out of the company. How dare you still try to steal my fiancé!""
The restaurant went completely silent in an instant, and everyone turned to stare at them in shock.
Arabelle was knocked sideways by the force of the slap. When she finally came back to reality, she realized that Adelina was just taking out her anger on her because of what had happened last night.
A sharp, stinging pain shot across her cheek. Around them, whispers quickly spread among the crowd.
""Is this a showdown with a home-wrecker? So dramatic!""
""Good for her! She's so pretty. Why would she want to be someone's mistress?""
""Aren't those Ms. Shelton from the Shelton family and Ms. Greyle, the ex-secretary? I heard Ms. Greyle was Mr. Chantler's girlfriend for years. Now that she's out of favor, the real girlfriend is coming after her. How sad!""
""Sad? What does she even have compared to Adelina? Does she really think she can compete with a Shelton heiress for a guy?""
Arabelle felt her whole body tremble as she locked eyes with Adelina, who looked ready to pounce. She bit down on her lip hard, bent down to grab her bag, and turned to walk away.
But Adelina wasn't having any of it. She looked super smug as she shot back with a cold warning.
""Arabelle, girls like you are everywhere. I could easily grab a bunch of you!
""Don't fool yourself into thinking you're special just because you've been with Benjamin for seven years! Back in the day, you'd just be another servant warming his feet!
""Let me give you a heads-up. Stay out of my way and Benjamin's. If not, I can make sure you're out of the Chantler Group in no time, and I'll also see to it that you can't stick around New York for even one more day!""
Arabelle's face went completely icy. She turned to look straight at Adelina.
""Ms. Shelton, don't worry about me. Benjamin and I haven't been tied together for ages now. I've already agreed to go back home for a blind date since my parents asked me to.
""Instead of coming here to throw threats at me, maybe focus on keeping your man in check and tell him to stop bothering me!""
She casually brought up her plan to leave, but when Adelina heard it, she totally misinterpreted it as Arabelle bragging about how Benjamin had reached out to her first.
Adelina's expression got even worse, a nasty look flashing across her face.
""Going back home for a blind date? Sounds more like you're heading back to pick up some tricks from your mom on how to snag guys!
""I heard your dad got into a car accident and now he can't use one of his legs. What a shame.
""How did your single mom manage to raise you? I bet she had to sell herself just to make ends meet.
""You grew up around that kind of stuff, which is why you think it's okay to go after someone else's fiancé. Like mother, like daughter!""
Adelina's voice was sharp and grating. Arabelle couldn't take it anymore.
""Shut up!""
She grabbed the coffee cup in front of her and splashed it right onto Adelina's face.
Coffee stains were all over Adelina, from her head to her toes. She looked at Arabelle in shock, yelled out loud, and shook with anger.
""Arabelle, how could you splash me like that? You're such a jerk. I won't let you get away with this!""
Arabelle's expression was icy and serious. ""If you keep talking trash, I won't just splash you. I'll hit you too!""
Just as she finished saying that, Benjamin walked in through the restaurant door.
He took one look at what was happening inside and headed straight for them.
Adelina immediately started crying and complained to him. ""Benjamin, I was just having a little chat with her when she threw coffee all over me.""
Arabelle's face turned bright red with rage. ""You were the one who insulted my family first—
Before she could finish her sentence, Benjamin grabbed a glass of iced water from a passing waiter.
With one quick motion, he poured the iced water right over Arabelle's head.
That cut off whatever else Arabelle wanted to say and completely snuffed out any last bit of affection she had for him in that moment.
Chapter 6
The cold water dripped down from her hair and soaked into her clothes, making her shiver.
Her hair stuck to her face, and the wet fabric of her outfit showed the outline of her underwear. She looked like a total mess.
Benjamin stared into Arabelle's eyes, which were filled with tears but she was holding back how she really felt.
""Just apologize to Adelina.""
That was always Benjamin's way.
He didn't care about what was right or wrong. He just wanted to protect whoever he chose.
After a moment of surprise, Adelina next to them quickly put on a smug look. She shot a challenging glare at Arabelle, waiting for an apology.
Arabelle spoke in a daze. ""What if... I don't?""
Benjamin's face was cold and hard. ""If you mess with my fiancée, I'll make sure you can never stay in New York again. And good luck trying to use that card of yours.""
Arabelle let out a bitter laugh.
They all thought she was with him for the money. They figured she couldn't bear to leave behind the glitz of this big city and would hang on no matter how tough it got. But they had no clue that she stuck around here just because of him.
And about that money...
Her hands shook as she dug into her bag. She pulled out the card Benjamin had given her once and set it down on the table.
""Here's your money back.
""I'm not sticking around in New York anymore.
""Anyway, I'm heading back to my hometown soon for a blind date.""
When Benjamin heard the words ""blind date,"" his eyes widened in shock.
Arabelle turned around and started to walk away. But just a couple of steps in, everything went dark for her, and she stumbled forward, nearly falling over.
In her ears, she could faintly hear Benjamin's worried voice.
""Arabelle!""
When Arabelle came to again, she found herself in a hospital room.
Benjamin was sitting by her bedside, his gaze as deep and cold as an icy lake, filled with mixed emotions as he stared at her.
As soon as he noticed she was awake, he tossed a medical report right at her.
Arabelle picked up the report, feeling totally confused, but her face went pale as soon as she saw ""6 weeks pregnant"" printed on it.
Lately, she hadn't been hungry at all, and her period was late.
She thought it was just some hormonal stuff from stress and didn't really think much of it. Never in a million years did she imagine... that it would turn out to be a pregnancy.
Next to her, Benjamin's voice was icy and sarcastic, filled with anger like he felt tricked.
""Arabelle, I thought you were at least somewhat decent. I never expected you to be bolder than anyone else, keeping something this huge from me behind my back.""
He leaned in closer to look at her, his sharp gaze putting a lot of pressure on her, and there was a smirk on his lips that dripped with sarcasm.
""Are you really going back for a blind date... or are you secretly planning to have my baby?""
Arabelle clutched the medical report in her hand, feeling completely helpless no matter what she said, ""I just found out too...""
She went quiet as soon as those words slipped out.
The cold sarcasm in Benjamin's eyes made it clear. He didn't buy it.
He stood tall and looked down at her pale face, his presence looming over her.
""Arabelle, my child can only come from my wife.
""Any kid carried by another woman is just an unwanted mistake that shouldn't even be here.
""I've set up the abortion for tomorrow.""
With that, he turned and walked out of the room without looking back.
She had never really had a choice.
Arabelle stared blankly at his disappearing figure, tears blurring her vision.
She curled up tight around herself and buried under the quilt, sobbing hard.
After Benjamin left, probably worried that she might try to escape, he had two bodyguards posted at the door.
When Arabelle followed the nurse for her pre-op checks, those bodyguards were right there with her every step of the way.
Arabelle stayed up all night.
The next day, while waiting for the abortion, she got a bunch of videos from Adelina on her phone.
Arabelle took a quick look and realized they were clips from Adelina and Benjamin's engagement ceremony.
Benjamin was in a black suit, looking tall and sharp, giving off a gentle and classy vibe.
A slight smile was on his face as he wrapped his arm around Adelina, accepting congratulations from guests one after another.
Adelina's face lit up with a big smile as she snuggled in his arms, stealing affectionate glances at him every now and then.
Just then, a young nurse knocked on the door to remind her.
""Ms. Greyle, it's almost time for your surgery.""
Arabelle put down her phone and nodded slowly.
""Okay.""
Not too far away in a fancy banquet hall, he was grinning like it was springtime while getting engaged to someone else. Meanwhile, she found herself in the cold, quiet hospital being led into the operating room.
With a heavy heart, she spread her legs and let the cold scalpel cut through the last connection they had left.
An hour later, Arabelle was rolled out of the operating room, her face as pale as a ghost.
She lightly touched her flat stomach. There was nothing there to feel, but it felt like something really painful, something that had sunk deep into her bones, was being ripped away from her.
Every breath she took sent a jolt of pain through her body.
Back in her ward, she changed into her own clothes and headed straight for the hospital exit.
The bodyguards raised their hands to stop her.
Arabelle said calmly, ""Benjamin told you to keep an eye on me because he thought I might try to run away before the surgery. Now that your job is done, you can go back and report.""
The two bodyguards exchanged glances and then called Benjamin. But it was Adelina who picked up the phone.
Her voice dripped with annoyance, ""Why are you talking about her right now? This is so irritating, just let her go.""
After leaving the hospital, Arabelle headed straight home.
She handed over the apartment to the buyer, grabbed her packed luggage from earlier that morning, and made a beeline for the airport.
Her old colleague, who had tricked her into going to that restaurant, sent an apologetic text.
""I'm really sorry. Adelina forced me into it.""
Arabelle didn't hold it against her but chose not to reply. She just tapped to block and delete the contact.
She did the same for Adelina, who kept sending videos of the engagement ceremony just to get under her skin.
Finally, she blocked Benjamin too. Ever since she added him as a contact, she just couldn't bring herself to delete any of his messages, no matter how many times she switched phones.
As soon as the plane took off, Arabelle let a faint smile creep onto her face.
""Benjamin, you saved my dad's life, and now I've given one back to you. From here on out, I don't owe you anything.
""Goodbye... and hopefully, never again.""

**Restitution**

We sat around the fire. Nyla and I discussed how we would handle the Mayor, remembering we strictly weren't required to kill anything. When we formulated a plan, we got some sleep before morning. Although we had the room at the Inn, we've been sleeping out in our packs this whole time. We decided to just stay and sleep under the stars.

The next morning, Nyla went into town while Skia and I kept Sweet company. Sweet took to her new name instantly. You could tell she was savoring the novelty of finally having something to call her own. We had camped in a small grove of trees, and that's where we waited for the Mayor.

Skia perked up and said, ""Nyla is back. And the Mayor is with her.""

I no longer asked how she did it. I just knew she would be right.

Nyla walked through the trees, the Mayor in tow.

Sweet, who had been pacing back and forth worried about meeting the Mayor, came to a complete stop, fear freezing her in place.

The Mayor, who had been chattering with Nyla, froze himself when he saw Sweet. After a moment of standing with his mouth open, he said, ""Skinwalker.""

I stepped in front of the Mayor to get his attention off of Sweet and onto me. ""Mr. Mayor, she's harmless. She's not going to hurt you or anyone else. She wanted to explain what happened and make amends.""

The Mayor, coming to his senses, said, ""Explain? Oh. Yeah. Yes, please explain.""

Sweet explained how she was unable to hunt in the area due to the overhunting by farmers. When she realized she would have to take livestock, she had heard that humans liked rocks, and that's why she made piles of them. Not realizing that different rocks had different values.

""Mayor, I am sincerely sorry for having caused any hardship. It was not my intent. I was just so hungry. I will do whatever is required to repay for the livestock I've taken,"" Sweet said with her head hung low.

The Mayor's expression softened. ""I understand. And I understand your reluctance to ask for help considering the bigotry your people have faced. As far as the cost, and you making restitution... well, technically you already have.""

We all looked confused, including Sweet. The Mayor smiled, reached into his pocket, and pulled out a small green gem.

""We found this stone amongst the rocks you had intended to pay with. This is one of the valuable stones. You don't remember where you got it from, do you?"" the Mayor asked.

Sweet, looking at the emerald, said, ""The pretty green ones? I found them next to the cliffs. They're just laying around. I didn't do anything wrong, did I?""

The Mayor reassured her. ""No, you did nothing wrong. Would you mind showing me where you found this one, and the rest you said were there?""

Sweet, looking both relieved and excited, agreed to show the Mayor. So we all took off towards the cliffs. Sweet explained it was only a few hours by foot.

When we reached the base of the cliff, it didn't take long for us to find the emeralds scattered among granite chips from the cliff face.

Amidst our excitement, the Mayor seemed stoic. When I asked him what was wrong, he explained.

""If word of this gets out, there will be nothing but trouble in our little town. First, scavengers will arrive to collect any of the emeralds they can find. Behind them will come the Mining Guilds. They will burn down the farms and enslave the farmers to work in the mines.""

The Mayor couldn't look more pensive.

""You're right,"" I said, looking at the stone. ""That's exactly what would happen.""

Nyla asked, ""But how will you keep this a secret?""

I suggested, ""Collect all of the emeralds you can find. Anything that's visible. Lock it in a box and hide it in City Hall. Then start a rumor about the Curse of the Cliffs. There never was a monster that took that livestock. It's part of the curse."" I smiled. ""That will keep people away from this area. Then sell the emeralds off a few at a time. Keep the money and build up the town's defenses. Once you can hold off the Mining Guilds, then you can break the curse and start your own mine.""

By this time the Mayor was smiling too. ""That might work. It's the long game, but other than simply abandoning our homes, I don't see a better option.""

Sweet asked, ""Does this mean I'm not in trouble?""

The Mayor chuckled. ""Most certainly not.""

We stayed another night near the cliffs after seeing the Mayor off. Skia showed Sweet her Shadow Hound form. Sweet seemed to be impressed but not particularly frightened. She explained that it's hard to hide from a Skinwalker. They can see things that can't be seen.

This later turned out to be quite useful.

Skia asked Nyla and myself if Sweet could join our family. We were happy to have her.

Skia asked, ""Sweet, would you like to be a part of our family? We travel together. We're going to find Paul's sister, Cindy. We beat slavers and watch out for each other.""

Sweet looked at us. ""You really want me to be a part of your family? I don't know... Skinwalkers are supposed to walk alone. I've never been around people for so long. But I really like you three. So yes. If you want me, I want you.""

**Providence Gate**

The Mayor was very thankful and showed it by loading us up. He provided everything we needed and threw in a little extra.

As we were traveling, we got to talking about Sanctuary, telling Sweet about it. Catching her up on our adventures. I was telling her about our first step to the Sanctuary gate.

I repeated myself, caught up in the story. ""Let's go.""

And once again, we were standing at the gate of Sanctuary. We all jumped.

Nyla glared at me. ""We could have been sleeping in Sanctuary this whole time? And you had me sleeping on the ground?""

I explained, ""I didn't know! How was I supposed to know?""

Nyla laughed and put her arms around me. ""I was only teasing you, my smelly wolf thingy.""

We explored Sanctuary, updating our map. Cindy was still in the same area.

""I wonder what Sanctuary looks like from the outside right now?"" I asked. ""Are we all the way back in the Gentle Place, or did the gate move?""

When we looked outside, it wasn't the Gentle Place. It was the road we had been walking on. But there was a transition—a shimmering distortion between the road and Sanctuary.

After more exploration and experimentation, we found that the gate disappeared from the outside world once we passed through it. And I could not make it go anyplace; I could only call it to myself.

It is Sanctuary, not transportation.

So we traveled by day, and called Sanctuary at night. After discussing our options, we decided that we should always be careful about calling Sanctuary. It was our secret, and we wanted to keep it.

**Heart Mending**

We continued on, working our way towards Cindy. Our daily routine was march all day, stopping briefly only to eat around midday.

When we stopped at night, I would call Sanctuary. I would head to the library, check on Cindy's position according to the map, and then join the rest in the armory to practice as a team. The armory was extensive, although Skia and Sweet needed no weapons.

We all practiced together, learning each other's strengths and weaknesses. We found that Skia could only sustain her Shadow Hound incarnation for a time. Shadow Hound and Skinwalker made an incredibly effective and fearsome team. Skia would advance as the Shadow Hound, laying waste to the practice dummies. Sweet would protect her back and advance when Skia needed to revert back, protecting Skia until she could re-emerge as the Shadow Hound.

Nyla and myself were like a cleaver and paring knife. I would rush in swinging *Chain Breaker*, clearing a path. Nyla, using her speed and acrobatic abilities, would come in for the kill.

We would train and cross-train for a few hours every night. And then bathe and sleep. The bath wasn't as good as back in the Prydia Solaris castle, but the water was always the perfect temperature, and like the rest of Sanctuary, self-cleaning.

A couple of nights of doing this, I heard a soft knock on the door of the room I had taken.

I opened the door to find Nyla standing there in a silky robe and a shy smile. ""May I come in?""

I jumped back from the door, not realizing I was blocking it as I stood staring at the woman I loved. ""Of course, my Princess.""

She stepped in and closed the door. Turning to face me, she said, ""I just found out that neither Sweet nor Skia can see through the walls or doors of Sanctuary.""

After that night, the two of us spent every night together. It only took a few mornings at breakfast for Skia to stop blushing and being embarrassed.

**Injustice Broken**

We were making our way through what the map called the Badlands. We stopped for a midday meal. The terrain was arid and hot. We found some shade to eat under.

""Sweet, what's wrong? You keep looking off to your left. I can't see anything but sand dunes,"" I asked.

Sweet turned and looked at me. ""There. The air is hurting.""

Nyla said, ""Well that sounds ominous. What do you mean the air is hurting?""

Sweet explained, ""You know the way tiny bugs sometimes fly around you? Well, around us all the time is life. I can see their life force. When the air is healthy, the air vibrates with life. Even in an inhospitable place like this, the air teems with life. But over there, the air hurts. Something is killing the life in the air.""

Skia said, ""No less ominous. I vote we check it out.""

Nyla looked at Skia like she had just asked to raid a wasp nest. But then her expression softened. ""Yes. I vote yes. If something's killing the air, I'd rather know what it was. Sweet, you're now part of the family. What do you say?""

Sweet beamed. ""I get a vote? Really? Then I vote yes. And I promise to watch for traps or hidden dangers.""

I hadn't stopped looking in the direction Sweet had indicated. ""Then it's unanimous. After we eat, we'll head that direction. Everybody stay alert.""

We finished eating in relative quiet and began to head towards the dead zone. Sweet was constantly sweeping her head, looking for any signs of danger. We came upon a shallow depression, and at the bottom was a cave.

Sweet, looking into the black mouth of the cave, said, ""Whatever it is, it's there.""

Nyla asked, ""Sweet, any sign of increased danger?""

Sweet answered without taking her eyes off the cave mouth. ""No. I can't see any increased danger. I don't see any poisons or gases that would kill the air. Whatever is doing it, it's definitely in the cave.""

With that, we headed towards the cave mouth, all of us on edge. A few feet in, and the blackness was broken by torches burning deeper in. We cautiously walked forward. That's when we saw the first of them.

Perfectly life-like statues of people. Statues dressed in armor tarnished with age, leather rotting away.

Nyla whispered, ""I've seen pictures of this style of armor. It's not been in fashion for a thousand years. What the hell is going on?""

It was then we heard crying. As we cautiously approached, we heard a voice.

""Please go away. I don't want to hurt you. I don't want to hurt anyone.""

""We don't want to hurt you either. We're just trying to figure out what's going on,"" I said. Then asked, ""Are you okay? You don't sound like you're okay.""

The disembodied voice called back. ""I'm lonely. I'm always lonely. I was born alone, and I must die alone. And then I will birth a child who will carry my curse.""

We had slowly been moving forward, but stopped at that declaration.

Nyla asked, ""Why? Why were you cursed? Why are your children cursed?""

""I am a Gorgon. A Medusa. Latest in a long line. When the original Medusa was raped by Poseidon in the Temple of Athena, she was cursed. Turning her beautiful hair into snakes and making anyone who looked upon her turn to stone. But Poseidon was a God, and so Medusa carried his seed. And when Medusa died, a child was born in this cave. A child who knew what had happened. And each time a mother passes, a daughter is born to continue the suffering of the curse.""

Skia was horrified. She was literally shaking with anger. ""We cannot stand for this to continue. Paul, this is wrong. This is more wrong than slavery. We must help her somehow.""

""I know. I agree. And we will,"" I said to my family. Then directing my voice back towards where we heard Medusa speaking, ""Medusa, I remember the stories from childhood about the original Medusa. Is it true that as long as you don't look on the person, that they will not be turned to stone?""

Medusa confirmed my suspicions, and I developed a plan.

Nyla smiled and said, ""I know that look. You have a plan, Paul.""

""Medusa, we're going to help you. Don't be afraid. You're not going to hurt us. I need you to close your eyes and turn your back to the entrance. You have to trust us. You're not alone anymore,"" I said, not waiting for confirmation. ""Sweet, I need you to go back and grab the helmet off of that big statue. You know, the brass one.""

Sweet didn't even ask. Just went back and got it and returned holding the helmet.

""Medusa, may we come in?"" I asked.

The reply was a heartbroken ""Yes.""

As we entered the main chamber, Medusa had arranged bits of trash and treasure into a place she could call home. Most of it ancient. She had sequestered herself here to protect others. The only things in here were things brought by others seeking treasure or her head. It was as tragic as her life.

Medusa was standing against the wall, her snake hair writhing but facing the wall, same as her. A tunic or robe of some sort covered her, but just barely as it had been old hundreds of years ago, time and deterioration taking its toll on it.

""Medusa, this is my plan. I too was cursed, and then I found Sanctuary. The magic of Sanctuary broke the curse. I'm hoping it will do the same for you. This is my plan: we're going to put this helmet over your head, but we're putting it on you backwards. So you won't be able to see anything. Then we will guide you out of the cave. When we're out, I will call on Sanctuary. And if I'm right, the curse will be broken. Are you willing to trust us?"" I explained.

Medusa said while crying, ""I have never looked at another person. I would do anything just to be able to look into the eyes of another person and know I wasn't killing them. Yes, I will trust you. Death would be better than this life. I only continue to live because I don't want to pass the curse on.""

We carefully slid the helmet over Medusa's head, her snake hair curling up underneath it. We took her arms and carefully guided her out of the cave. When we were in the open, I called Sanctuary. It appeared before us. Holding my breath, we guided Medusa past the gate.

As soon as we did, she shimmered.

Medusa said, ""I feel different. I think it worked. But how will we know?""

Sweet said, ""It worked. I know it did. Before, there was an aura of death around you. Now, I don't see it. Now I only see life.""

Medusa nearly collapsed. When I went to pull her helmet off, she stopped me. ""I'm scared. But if she's wrong... but if I'm still a monster...""

Before I could say anything, Sweet replied, ""You were never a monster. You are a hero. You hid yourself away, sacrificing your happiness to keep others safe. You are the hero, not the monster. The monster was the one who took advantage of the original Medusa and cursed your whole line to loneliness.""

Skia said, ""I trust Sweet. If she says the curse is broken, it's broken. Remove the helmet. We want to see you.""

Sweet stood in front of Medusa and helped her remove the helmet. As she pulled it off, the first face Medusa saw was that of Sweet. She looked into the eyes of the Skinwalker and said, ""You're more beautiful than I imagined.""

Sweet wrapped Medusa in a loving embrace. ""And you are more beautiful than I imagined.""

Skia threw her arms around both women, declaring, ""More family!""

I'd love to be able to play games like Stardew Valley, Civ 6, OSRS, etc.

I also watch a lot of movies/tv shows on my laptops, and enjoy sitting in coffee shops working on my writing for lengthy periods of time.

No refurbished, I want to get one that is brand new.

Preferably I'd like one that costs $1,000 or less. Anyone have any recommendations?",1,1765136776.0,laptops,0,1.0,False

I have my routines, my hobbies, and my whole life figured out. But lately, I've realized that having everything together alone just makes me want to share it with someone 🥹

A bit about me: I'm 25, a software engineer from India currently doing my masters. I'm 5'09"" and I work out regularly (gym is my therapy lol), so I have a pretty fit athletic build. I wear glasses and I've been told I have a warm smile, but you can be the judge of that 😊

Interest wise, I'm into gaming, anime, k-dramas that destroy me emotionally, and hiking/trekking when I can. Also, I absolutely love cooking. Like, it's genuinely my happy place.

What I'm actually like:

I remember random things people tell me and bring them up weeks later (is this a superpower or am I just obsessive? unclear). I get genuinely excited about small things like perfecting a new recipe or finding the perfect song for a moment.

I'm the good morning how'd you sleep and did you eat today type of person. My love language is acts of service mixed with quality time, like I will cook your favorite meal while we watch something together. I'm emotionally available and actually want to talk about real stuff, not just surface level memes (though I love those too)

What I'm looking for:

Someone I can text first thing in the morning and last thing at night without it feeling forced. Someone who wants to share the small mundane stuff, like I saw this weird bird today or my coffee was perfect this morning.

I want someone I can be silly with but also have those deep late night convos about life and dreams and fears. Someone who appreciates effort and consistency and is okay with me getting attached and caring deeply because that's just how I'm wired.

What dating me looks like:

Imagine having someone who's genuinely invested in your day, who asks follow up questions about that thing you mentioned last week, who sends you songs saying this made me think of you.

Cozy nights where I cook us dinner (maybe in an apron because why not) and we just exist together watching shows or talking about everything and nothing. Having someone who's your biggest hype person but also your safe space when things get rough.

I'm open to long distance because honestly if we genuinely connect I don't care if you're across the world. I can travel and I'm willing to work towards eventually closing the gap if we build something real.

You don't need to be perfect (neither am I) or into all my hobbies. You just need to actually want something long term, put in effort because relationships are a two way street, and communicate when something's wrong instead of just disappearing.

If this resonates with you, tell me about the last thing that genuinely made you happy or your comfort show that you rewatch constantly. Let's see if we vibe and maybe turn this whole forever alone thing into a we found each other thing ✨

Fair warning: I will send you reels and memes at random hours, I will get excited about dumb things and I will probably care about you way more than socially acceptable, you've been warned 💕

Looking forward to meeting you whoever you are 😊",2,1765136715.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

I’m 34yrs old Georgian, and I want to be honest here. For years my life revolved around clubs, drinking, and drugs. I’m not proud of it — it’s just the truth.
Recently I realized that I don’t want that lifestyle anymore. I’ve been sober for a little while now, and I’m trying to take better care of myself. It feels good… but also a bit lonely sometimes. And that’s one of the big reasons I’m writing this post.

I’m in a new chapter of my life, and I’d love to meet friendly, grounded people. People you can grab a coffee with, take a walk, share a hobby, or just have a real conversation without needing to get wasted.

So I wanted to ask:
Where in Tbilisi can I go, what groups or activities can I join, to meet people in a sober, healthy environment?
If you’ve been through something similar — I’d really appreciate hearing what helped you.

Thanks to anyone who reads or replies 🙏

It has been 33 long years since the day my mother died from pushing me out of the womb. I can still feel her pain as if it were my own. I chose to run away from that pain for so many years, trying desperately to feel anything else. I'd spent every cent I had ever earned on drugs, cheap booze, and fuel for the road. I couldn't stop. I'd been running for so long, but always had this voice gnawing at me, telling me to slow down. It kept saying that there was a place for me out there somewhere. I was just so tired and beaten down. I was almost ready to give up before I actually listened to it, but once I did, everything seemed to fall right in place. A quick Google search was all it took to find my way out.

Nestled in the rolling hills of Northern West Virginia was a small log cabin for sale. The listing offered beautiful landscapes and a quiet 10-acre lot for the ridiculously low price of $115,000. For that much of a deal, I could not pass it up. I gathered the money I had left in my account from my inheritance, loaded up my ’79 Bronco, and headed toward my new home.

The gravel crunched under the tires as I pulled into the driveway. My old Bronco rattled over the uneven ground as I glanced up at the place I hoped would be my salvation. True to the listing, a log cabin, weathered by time and the harsh northern winters, stood quietly at the edge of a dense forest. When I saw it online, I could not have dreamt a more perfect place for my tired soul. Now that I was here, it seemed less appealing than I had imagined. Moss climbed the stairs. Tree roots tangled around the foundation like veins. I ran my hand over the cracked wood of the porch railing, feeling its roughness beneath my fingertips. No matter how dilapidated the house looked, it was already a big improvement compared to the savage streets of Detroit.

This was it. This was my chance to escape, to bury my past, and to breathe finally.

I’d spent years on the road, mainly filled with nights spent in cheap motels and days filled with regret and a numbness I couldn’t shake. But this place, this wild patch of land surrounded by towering pines and ancient oaks, felt different. Raw and untouched. Alive.

The air was sharp with pine and earth, the scent of rain lingering on the breeze. I inhaled deeply, chest tightening against the clean air. It was fresh and calm, but seemed to have something attached to it. Something I couldn’t quite make out. I eventually settled my nerves by telling myself it was all just the jitters of finally slowing down. My body still felt like it needed to be moving a hundred miles an hour to be safe. 

I unloaded my bags from the Bronco, the last material thing I owned from a past life... a life that I wanted to forget... and stepped inside.

The quaint little cabin sat just beyond the town of Indigo Falls, a small dot on the map that seemed to blend in with the surrounding trees. The sleepy little West Virginia town boasted only a small cluster of buildings that were barely visible from the highway. There were a few trucks, a general store, and a diner with a flickering neon sign out front that spelled “Harlan’s” in tired pink letters.

The first three days blurred into quiet routines, time spent unpacking boxes, stacking firewood, and exploring the thick woods that surrounded the cabin became the norm. The forest was both comforting and unsettling. Every crack of a branch underfoot echoed in the silence of the meadows and clearings. Shadows shifted just beyond the edge of the trees, as if someone was always with you. The wind blew through the canopy like whispers of the dead. If I listened hard enough, I could almost hear words on the breeze.

At night, the forest pulsed with life. Owls hooted, insects droned, but something deeper stirred as well. Long after the sun went down, something strange called the woods home. I didn’t understand it, and yet, I didn’t care to. This place was paradise from what I had come from and endured. A little oddity here and there wasn’t going to scare me off.

On my fourth day in town, after a vigorous morning of chores, hunger and curiosity led me to the diner. I drove down the hill and across the covered bridge that connects the rolling hills with the center of town. Crossing the small speed bump that separated dirt from asphalt, I spotted a sign that read:

'Indigo Falls – Population: 68'

This place was amazing. The roads had no red lights or even stop signs. The only cautionary measure was a yellow caution light that blinked intermittently at the center of town.

I pulled into the diner’s parking lot and secured a spot. Harlan’s Diner was a squat brick building with chipped paint and windows fogged by steam. The place was packed. It looked like every person in town was having breakfast at the same time. The bell above the door jingled as I stepped inside. The smell hit me instantly. Bacon grease, strong coffee, and the faint scent of stale cigarette smoke permeated the air, the griddle sizzling with eggs and bacon that covered every inch.

The diner was full, aside from an open seat here and there. Old men and women occupied the creaking metal barstools that lined the counter. They sat nursing their black coffee and folded newspapers, occasionally chatting with one another. Their conversations were low, punctuated by laughter that didn’t quite sound right.

As the door closed behind me, ringing the bell once more, all heads turned. It wasn't in hostility, but in awareness. They didn’t know me, and they wanted me to feel that. The silence was deafening as my feet froze to the sticky linoleum floor. I could feel every set of eyes on me like red-hot fire pokers jabbing at my soul.

Behind the counter was a woman. Her red hair was pulled back in a loose knot, strands falling over her face. She looked up and smiled, the kind of smile that someone gives as forced pleasantry.

“Don’t just stand there, come on in,” she said in a sweet, inviting tone.

I stumbled awkwardly as I turned in her direction and shuffled over to an open stool.

“New in town?” she asked, her voice warm but tired.

“Yeah,” I said, sliding onto the stool. “Moved into the cabin outside town a few days ago.”

She nodded. “I’m Clarice, but everybody here calls me Clara, hence the nametag.”

She pointed to her shirt at a patch that had “Clara” stitched in black thread.

“My name’s Elias.”

She wiped her hands on a rag and poured me a black coffee.

“Well… Elias…” She said in a playful, teasing way. “You’ll find it’s quiet here. Too quiet, some say.”

I let out a small laugh.

“Why do you say that?” I asked as I took a sip of my coffee.

“Well, some folks don’t like to be bothered… especially around here.”

She shot a glance over at an old man who was peering across the top of his newspaper at us. I glanced, following her eyes over to the man. As my eyes met his, he ducked behind his newspaper once more.

“Hmmm… Well, I guess I can’t say I blame them.” I responded, turning my head back around to meet Clara’s eyes.

“Don’t worry about that old grouch.” She said playfully. “He just needs another cup of coffee.”

She shot another glance at the man, yet he didn’t reveal his face from behind the paper this time. She focused back on my face as she spoke to me,

“So, whatcha want for breakfast, hon?”

The rest of the morning was spent in playful conversation with Clara, the cute, red-haired woman who seemed to be sent here just for me.

Clara felt completely different from the people in town. She was kind and warm. A person who was gentle and understanding in such a way that you could talk to her about anything. Over the next few days, I finished the arduous move-in process. My reward was enjoying Clara’s company at Harlan’s with a strong cup of coffee and a hearty breakfast.

I had been in town for only a week, but it felt like I had been here for decades with Clara behind the counter. She had become my beacon of hope in a place that I still wasn’t sure of yet.

“So…. You never told me where you were originally from.” Clara said with a curious look.

“Hmph… yeah, that is a story too long to tell over just a coffee.” I half-chuckled in response.

She leaned over the counter close to me, almost touching my ear with her lips, and in a half-whisper said,

“Well, I keep a bottle of Four Roses back here for when things get slow. Ya wanna get loaded and do naughty stuff behind the dumpsters out back?”

I choked on my coffee, my face immediately turning red. She giggled, knowing that she had tripped me up with that comment.

“Hahaha, just messing... but seriously... I want to know more about you, Elias.”

“Ok… well, you can come up to my cabin if you’d like. It’s just outside of town, across the covered bridge, up past Grist Mill Road.” I responded confidently. “I can give you the address, and you can come by when you get off… if that’s ok, of course…”

“Haha, that sounds perfect, honey.” She said with a smile.

Looking into her beautiful green eyes, I was captured… mesmerized by her beauty. I couldn’t believe where I had found myself. I found this place by accident… It was a pipedream I thought would never be achieved… and yet, another part of me felt like I was owed this life. I had been through hell to get here, and it was time for a change.

From the moment I met Clara, time seemed to fly by. Over the next week, Clara and I settled into a rhythm. Mornings at Harlan’s, sharing late breakfasts. Sometimes she’d take me on slow walks near the edge of the woods, pointing out plants and telling stories about the town’s history. Over that time, I told her all about my mom and her side of the family. I told her about the times I shared with people on the road and what city life was like back in Detroit. We talked freely with one another, but we both felt like the other was holding something back… hiding something.

At the beginning of my third week in town, Clara got off early and met me outside my cabin for a hike. We had become remarkably close over the last couple of weeks. As usual, this was our time to talk and decompress in the beautiful West Virginia hills. We walked down the forest trails, combing through the ins and outs of small-town life. As we walked, Clara grabbed my arm and snuggled in close to my side.

“So, tell me about your dad. You’ve told me all about your mom and her side, but you haven’t mentioned your dad much at all,” she said, giving me a confused look.

“Yeah, that’s a sore subject. It’s one of those things that I would like to just lock away and forget, you know what I mean?”

“I do… but you know we talk about everything, Eli. I want to know everything about you.” She said, smiling at me and pushing her cheek into my shoulder.

“I guess so…” I muttered in return.

“Well… are you gonna tell me?” she asked, pressing a little further.

I couldn’t resist Clara’s charm. She was my kryptonite. I had only known her for a few weeks, but it felt like so much more.

 “Ahem…” I choked up a little as I started to talk, “Well, it starts back when I was just a baby.” 

I paused, knowing that this part of my life was so traumatic, so intense that I had literally compressed it into a little ball and pushed it as far back into my mind as I could, hoping that it would die and rot away without ever resurfacing again. I continued, fighting the urge to bury it again, 

“My dad was a heavy drinker and a very mean person… As a child, my brother and I only knew beatings and pain. We would get beat for being late to school… beat for being late to dinner… hell, we even got beat for not crying when we got beat.”

“Oh my God, that is awful! I am so sorry, Elias. I didn’t know it was like that for you.” She said, sounding troubled.

“It’s ok. That drunk bastard killed himself with a 12-gauge during the Super Bowl about 16 years ago, so he got what was coming to him.” I said coldly.

“Jesus! He committed suicide in front of you!?” she asked, searching my face intently for the answer.

“No… my brother and I weren’t home, and it wasn’t a suicide. He was trying to shoot the neighbor's cat in our yard and dropped the gun while trying to open the window. Boom… just like that, he ended my nightmare… and my brother’s.”

She paused, not yet knowing what to say. Feeling the tension from the moment, I tried to lighten it by adding what I considered 'the good part.'

“Well… It wasn’t all bad. My grandpa made a lot of money in the stock market before the dotcom crash in 2000. He died a couple of years later and left it to my dad. Since he didn’t have a will, my brother Josh and I received it as an inheritance when he died and split it. So, I guess the good thing about it is that I don’t have to worry about money anymore.” I gave a slight chuckle, trying to relax the mood.

“Where is your brother now?” she asked.

“Last I heard, he had joined the army and was stationed in Fort Benning. He always wanted to be in the army. He was always talking about how he wanted to make a difference and jump out of planes. I never really understood it, but it made him happy.”

“At least he is doing something that he likes.” She responded.

“Yeah… I guess so.”

We walked a little further down the trail, silent. The conversation weighed heavily in the air between us. As the sun started to fall, she finally spoke up again.

“The Harvest Festival is coming up soon,” she said, kicking at the gravel on the trailside. “It’s the biggest event Indigo Falls has. Everyone will be there. It’s a... tradition.”

“What kind of tradition?” I asked.

She hesitated, eyes flicking to the woods.

“Old stories. Old songs. You’ll see… Will you go with me?” she asked, looking up at me with her intoxicating green eyes.

“Of course I will!” I responded quickly.

The walks I had with Clara were renewing my soul little by little. Each time we were together, I could feel a powerful warmth wash over me, and then I became calm. The townsfolk, however, weren’t as welcoming as she was. I stopped by the grocery store after mine and Clara’s hike to grab a few things for dinner. When I came through the door, I could see Jimmy, the clerk, standing behind the counter.

Since I had moved in, he was always there, no matter the time of day. It seemed like all Jimmy did was work. As I walked by him, I nodded in his direction with a half-smile. He barely looked at me. He was a nice guy, by my estimation. The times I had come in before, he was pleasant and helpful. Something was different this time… something was wrong.

“Whatcha need?” he said with a monotonous groan.

“A few things,” I said. “Just a few essentials for next week.”

He shoved the items across the counter, making no eye contact. When I tried to make conversation, he would cut me off or ask an abrupt question.

“That all?” he asked, his expression becoming more irritated.

“Y...Yeah, I guess so...” I replied.

“Good, that’ll be $36.78. Cash only.”

Caught off guard by this, I quickly reached into my pocket, fumbling for the bills. He had never done this before. He always lets me use my debit card. Why was he asking for cash only? When I pulled my hand out, all I had was a 20 and a 10, accompanied by a wad of matted pocket lint. I held the money up toward Jimmy, mouth slightly agape, as if I were a mute asking if this would be enough with just my facial expression. His brow furrowed. With a violent rush, he sprang toward me and grabbed my jacket, pulling me close to him.

“Is this some kind of sick joke, buddy?” he snarled in my face.

“Wh...What do you mean? I...I’m just trying to pay for my groceries. Look, here’s cash. It’s all I have on me right now.”

“Ha! You know damn well that ain’t what I said. I said, Thirty-six dollars and seventy-eight cents, not thirty, you fucking idiot!” He screamed in my face. ""If you don't have the money, then get the fuck out of my store!”

He pushed me away from him as he released my jacket. I stood stunned for a moment. I had never had anyone in town act like this toward me, especially not Jimmy. He stared at me, red-faced, veins popping from his neck, fuming over the audacity of my ignorance. The fact that I came in to buy groceries without exact change was inconceivable to him. As I stumbled out of the store empty-handed, all I could do was think about how this place felt different… changed in some way.

The air in town felt charged, like I’d walked into a spider’s web and the spiders were watching me, waiting. I noticed people stopping their conversations when I approached. The few kids on the playground would fall silent and glance away. Older women eyed me over knitting needles, their fingers tightening involuntarily, knuckles turning white from the force. It felt like I was becoming an outcast in a place that just weeks ago was my refuge. It felt like everybody was starting to hate me for some reason.

The next night, after Clara closed the diner, I invited her to my porch for a few drinks. The sky was a patchwork of stars behind the dark silhouettes of trees. The crickets provided the perfect ambience for her pleasant company.

“Did you hear how Jimmy acted toward me yesterday?” I asked.

“Yeah, it was all he could talk about when he came in for dinner last night.” She responded.

“I had some weird encounters with the folks in town as well… it’s been… strange lately.”

She lowered her head, staring at her glass. She ran her finger around the edge slowly as if she were in a trance.

“Why do you think they act like that?” I asked, taking a sip of a beer.

She looked out into the woods, tracing a pattern on the weathered trees.

“Because they’re scared,” she said softly. “Scared of change… of outsiders. Indigo Falls likes its secrets. It’s how they keep the town... safe and healthy.”

“Safe from what?”

Her eyes met mine, filled with sadness I couldn’t place.

“From what’s in these hills.”

These hills? I pondered... my eyes slowly scanning the darkness.

The more I stared into them, the more they felt alive. I could feel them watching and breathing. Strange sounds echoed in the distance. Low humming and the snap of twigs rose from the dark, not from animals, but something else. The mystery of the hills around me had become front and center in my mind. I couldn’t place it, but something had shifted in the air, and it was starting to cause my little piece of heaven to crumble right in front of me.

“Is there anything I can do to stop it?” I asked.

“No… these folks have been here a long time… and I do mean a very long time… They don’t like anybody coming in that they don’t know.” She continued. “Every year around the harvest festival, it gets this way. It will pass, and they will get back to normal. It’s just an old tradition that started a long time ago, and people never really let it go.”

My eyes searched her face as she spoke. Her words reassured me. There was nothing that Clara couldn’t fix in my mind. I just had to endure this weird “tradition” of outsider hazing or whatever they wanted to call it, and then hopefully we could get back to normal.

The rest of the night after our conversation was routine. Clara and I spent the evening swapping stories and laughing with one another well into the night. The idea of the hills having secrets stuck with me, however. My mind couldn’t erase the look on Jimmy’s face when he grabbed me. He had true hate in his eyes. I hadn’t seen that look since my dad was alive. I needed to focus on more important things to get my mind off it.

The next day, I made my way down to Gene’s general store to purchase some nails and boards for the cabin. The railing was getting on my nerves and would give me a nasty splinter every time I tried to grab it. Entering the store for the first time, I could hear the tired, old speaker behind the counter playing old music. It sounded like slow jazz… something old. I grabbed my items and approached the counter.

“Good morning, sir. I hope you found what you were looking for.” The man said in an upbeat and jolly tone.

“Umm… Yeah… I did. Do you—”

He cut me off before I could finish asking my question.

“That’ll be $16.25, sir.” He announced with a wide smile.

 “Uh…. Ok… Do you take debit cards?” I asked.

“Tsk… No, I’m afraid not, sir. Cash only here. Sorry about that.” The man responded, clicking his tongue against his teeth.

“No worries, I have some cash on me.” I quickly responded. I had prepared for this scenario ever since the Jimmy situation happened.

I pulled out a handful of bills and began counting the total on the counter. As I counted the bills in front of him, his eyes left my face and slowly rolled down to the counter below. Still smiling, his face started turning pink… and then red… his eyes started bulging from their sockets, and he began gritting his teeth so hard that I could hear them grinding behind his smile. Suddenly, he slammed his hand down against the counter, rattling the coins and flattening the bills I had placed.

“This isn’t a bank… sir.” The man said through gritted teeth, still trying to hold his smile.

“I’m just trying to count exact change for you. I know you need exac...”

He cut me off again before I could finish.

“Like I said… This is not a bank, sir!” His face was now blood-red, and his eyes stared at me with pure vitriol.

“Ok, ok, no problem, man, easy. I don’t want any issues here.”

He stared at me, his hand shaking with anger, clenching the bills on the counter. Then, as quickly as the anger flared, it vanished, replaced by a chilling silence. The old radio had become more apparent now. An old jazz tune had become the background of our staring contest. A slow, almost predatory smile spread across his face before he spoke.

""You know too much,"" he remarked, his voice dangerously gleeful.

“What? What do you mean, I know too much?” I asked, full of confusion.

“Have a wonderful day, sir, and remember, don’t nix it, Gene can fix it!” He answered, not acknowledging my question.

I turned to leave, and as I made my way outside, I looked back through the window. There, I saw Gene still standing behind the counter, that same smile plastered on his face, staring at me as I walked down the steps.

The next night, just after midnight, I heard footsteps crunching outside my window. I grabbed a flashlight and my revolver from the bedside drawer. I was in bear country, and I did not want to become dinner for whatever was out there. My heart pounded in my chest. I crept through the cabin, following the sound of the footsteps, which were slowly inching toward the front door.

The more I listened, the more they sounded like someone walking. This was no bear. It was a person. The sounds were now coming from right outside. Heavy footsteps creaked across the slats on the front porch. I grabbed the door handle and, with a deep breath, swung the door open. As the door opened, I clicked the flashlight on and leveled the revolver in the middle of the beam. I scanned the porch and the surrounding area, but saw nothing. Nothing but shadows and silence filled the air. I closed the door behind me and pushed my back against it, taking a deep, calming breath. The idea of a person skulking around my cabin did not sit too well with me, especially in these hills, especially with how everyone had been acting.

The next couple of nights were more of the same. I would hear footsteps approach my window at midnight, creeping their way around the cabin until they drew me to the front door. I foolishly took the bait every time, looking like an idiot standing on my porch with nothing but boxers, a Maglite, and my dad’s old .38 revolver.

That Friday, I headed back into town to do my weekly grocery run, no matter how much I dreaded it. I knew Jimmy was going to give me shit, no matter if I had exact change or not. I learned my lesson quickly on the cash-only request. I received my groceries and endured Jimmy’s hate-filled eyes as I paid and made my way out to my truck. I loaded the groceries into the Bronco and started to hop into the driver’s seat when a wild thought struck me. I decided that, instead of getting in the Bronco and driving straight home, I was going to take a walk around town and take in the cool weather that was starting to roll in. I needed some time away from the cabin.

I walked down toward the center of town, where the town hall sat. I rounded the turn on Quincy Street, head down, pondering the curiosity of this place, when suddenly, I was struck hard in the shoulder by what felt like a semi. I was sent flying, eventually crashing to the ground in a heap. As I lay on the ground trying to get my bearings, I heard a deep, raspy voice ask,

“Whoa there, boy! You ok?”

Still dazed, I couldn’t respond to the question yet.

“Sorry bout that, son… Don’t see as well as I used to. Sometimes I just run right into shit and not even know it... hehehe.”

I finally gathered my wits about me and looked up at the man. He was tall and lean, his face weathered like bark, eyes sharp but cloudy, like they had seen things no human should ever see. He wore an old pair of overalls with a red shirt underneath and a straw hat that looked like it had seen better days.

“Yeah, I’m ok. I should’ve been looking when I came around that corner.” I replied.

“Heh, no worries, son. These days, everybody is on that damn phone looking at stupid shit nobody cares about. It happens more times than you think.”

I laughed as the old man helped me up. His lips and skin looked parched and worn, like an old leather satchel, and he had one brown tooth that stuck out when he spoke.

“The name’s Tom.” He boomed. “And you are?”

He stuck out his hand for a handshake.

“El...Elias, sir.” I responded, grabbing the man’s calloused hand.

With a firm grip, he shook my hand and shot me a half-smile.

“Nice to meet ya, Elias. Where ya headed, son?” He asked.

“Well, I was just walking around a bit, but I guess I’m gonna head on back to my truck,” I responded.

“Well, good, I’ll walk with ya. It ain’t every day I get to talk to someone new, ya know?”

“Ehh… That’s ok, I don’t want to interrupt your day.” I said in return.

“Nonsense, I need to stretch out the ol’ legs anyway.”

Tom walked with me back to my truck even as I protested. I was already on the bad side of most people in town for reasons I didn’t understand. I didn’t need to owe anybody any favors or piss anybody off. As we walked, he kept a happy and carefree demeanor. We talked the entire way back.

“When’d you move to town?” he asked, his smile slightly fading from his face.

“I’ve been here about a month or so. I like the place, but some of these people are just strange.” I replied.

He gave a slight nod and looked forward as if he knew exactly what I was talking about. As we approached my truck, he pulled out a pack of cigarettes and stuck one between his weathered lips and spoke.

“Well, son, this town has some strange history. Hell, I live here and still don’t understand it.”

He took a long drag on his cigarette.

“I lived close to here as a boy ‘til I got sent to Vietnam. I wasn’t much the same after I came back from that. I had some… issues at home when I got back and had to move out here. I never felt like this place was home for me. I’ve only lived here for ten years myself.”

He took another drag, squinting his eyes as the smoke encircled the brim of his hat.

“This town’s got its layers,” he said, voice rough. “People like to keep the surface smooth, but underneath, things aren’t so simple.”

“What kind of things?” I asked.

He flicked ash onto the ground.

“Things that people don’t like to talk about.” He answered. “Now you get your gear and head on home before it gets dark. These roads get dangerous at night.”

He took one more long drag off his cigarette and flicked it to the ground, stamping it out with his boot.

“You take care now, ya hear? Nice meetin’ you, Elias. I’ll be seein’ ya.”

The man walked back the way he came, leaving me with more questions than answers. Confused, I climbed into the Bronco and made my way back home.

That night, I lay awake, listening to the wind twisting through the trees. Tom’s words swirled in my mind.

“What did he mean by layers?” I asked myself. “And what don’t these people want to talk about? What is so secretive?”

The thoughts raced through my skull as I lay in bed, trying not to think about the footsteps actively crunching around the cabin’s perimeter. Indigo Falls was no longer my safe haven. It had become a cage.",2,1765136366.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,0,1.0,False
1pgrfne,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1pgrfne/help_with_choosing_setup_no_budget/,Help with choosing setup [no budget],"Hi all!
Would love some advice on my situation from y’all fine grinders.

I want to dive deeper in the hobby and upgrade my automatic machine.
I don’t mind investing in really expensive gear but the problem I have with those high tier machines is that I see what is the heat up time and it seems to be minimum of 15 mins to be ready for use and like 30+ for ideal temps and consistency. I don’t mind waiting, but like 10 mins at most. A common use case is that a friend pays a short visit in short notice and unfortunately I won’t wait for 20+ mins just to make him some coffee. (So solutions like smart switch, as effective as they are, are not applicable here).

So I started looking on the breville barista pro which was also attractive due to its price. But then I know the shortcomings of its grinder.
So I have couple questions about this. First some assumptions:

1. My tastes buds are decent and I know to distinguish between different quality levels of coffee. 
2. I really like and want to some extent a single dose experience.

The questions:
1. I saw the single dose hopper mods. I know they won’t help with grind consistency but do they really help with retention to almost single dose level?
2. How bad is the grind consistency of the barista pro?
3. How good is the temp control and consistency of the barista pro?
4. Is getting the barista pro with dedicated grinder reasonable considering all of this?
5. If you have any additional insights for my situation please share!

Thanks 🙏🏻 ",0,1765136318.0,espresso,1,0.5,False

In return, I offer everything I have. Materially, it is not much. Emotionally, I offer listening ears, admiring eyes and almost the entirety of my heart. Small words with promises behind them. Kindness, empathy, commitment, mutual respect and fair power dynamics matter deeply to me. My humour is a little twisted and not always everyone’s cup of tea.

I am on my journey to find my Ikigai, the idea of living a balanced and meaningful life. Come help me find mine and I will try my best to find yours.

⸻

1. Age, Gender and Height

Male, born 1990. Height: 5’8”.

2. Age Range I Prefer

Around 28-ish to somewhere in the mid or late 30s. Maturity appreciated.

3. Location and Relocation

Open to someone from anywhere, as long as relocating to Australia is not a dealbreaker and you do not mind sharing the usual sunlight, sunscreen, stress and a steady stream of silliness.

4. Nationality

Bangladeshi-born, now an Australian citizen.

5. Marital Status

Divorced, with clarity on what I want moving forward.

6. Ideal Marriage Timeline

Preferably within 8 to 12 months. I think that is enough time to build understanding, chemistry and shared direction.

⸻

7. About Me

I work as an engineer and spend whatever time remains trying to behave like a functional adult.
I left Bangladesh young, came here to study and lived through the familiar first-gen immigrant experience: strange jobs, stranger meals, tight money and slowly piecing together something steady. I am grateful for the road that carried me here. Some days I look steady; most days I am just afloat and pretending I meant to be.

I am laid back, chaotic under pressure, gifted at procrastination, dependable when cleaning and hopeless in the kitchen. I try to stay grounded and take responsibility for my choices, even the questionable ones. My favourite ending to a day is a quiet conscience, and my favourite beginning is the smell of freshly ground coffee drifting through a still morning.

⸻

8. Five Important Characteristics I Look For

1. Someone who understands respect and practices it consistently. Maintains healthy boundaries for themselves and others, and treats people with consideration in daily interactions.

2. Emotionally aware, kind and able to hold space for both silence and conversation, and willing to build an emotionally safe relationship where vulnerability is treated with care.

3. Progressive thinker with flexible beliefs.
Not rigid or dogmatic. Able to communicate strong opinions clearly and open to evolving when presented with new perspectives.

4. Communicates with maturity and understands that words, tone and body language all matter. Can give and receive feedback and values emotional transparency.

5. Someone who cares about the world they live in. Thoughtful about charity, sustainability and making choices that minimise harm.

⸻

9. Religiosity

Atheist and respectful of beliefs, with a culturally Muslim upbringing. I have learned from experience that I am most compatible with someone who is not guided by rigid religious expectations, especially when it comes to shared values, decision-making and raising future children.

⸻

10. Education and What I Am Looking For

Bachelor’s in Engineering, completed in 2015 in Sydney. I hope to study further in the future. 

I am looking for someone who has completed their bachelor’s and is progressing in their career or pursuing higher education.

⸻

11. Current Job Status

Full-time engineer in MAANG. Career is stable and predictable, which is both comforting and slightly dull.

⸻

12. Do I Want Kids

Open to the idea of kids, but only if we are not passing down the generational trauma that came with us.

⸻

13. Hobbies and Spare-Time Joys

Most of my free time goes straight to sleep.
Indoor rowing with a podcast or audiobook is how I switch my brain off.
I am strangely obsessed with coffee and moka pots; I own five moka pots and two grinders for reasons I cannot fully explain.
If a problem at work is interesting enough, I bring it home and tinker through the night, then turn up to work again with barely any sleep.
I have not travelled much yet, but I imagine it would be a lot more fun with the right person beside me.

⸻

14. Something Interesting About Me

I grew up in a Bangladeshi household where authority sat with the father and respect travelled mostly in one direction. I carried some of those ideas into adulthood until life and distance made me question them. I have been unlearning old patterns ever since and trying to make room for something healthier, where both people feel heard and valued.

I find comfort in misty mountain ridges, in old pages of heartache-filled poetry, in the quiet just before rain and the bite of wet grass beneath my feet. Cannabis, used responsibly, deepens that calm. A simple and rustic life appeals to the version of me that still daydreams, though suburban comfort has a way of pulling me back into familiar routines. I often imagine myself in a small treehouse in the forest with hot water, a reliable roof and just enough internet to check whether the world has coped with my short-lived disappearance.

I was briefly married once. We walked into something we were not ready for and the path did not hold. It left me with a better sense of what it means to choose the right person with intention and clarity.

⸻

15. What I Am Looking For in a Woman

Kindness and clarity in thought draw me more than anything else. A woman with a progressive mind and the maturity to navigate difficult moments with steadiness. Someone who believes in honest communication and a life that feels balanced rather than frantic.

Partnership, for me, is two people choosing to stand beside each other through storms and resolving issues with patience and an open heart. Someone who can forgive without keeping score and who understands that sacrifices made with care strengthen the bond.

What matters most is a person who feels comfortable in her own presence and takes care of herself without chasing perfection. A little tolerance for my sometimes questionable fashion sense is welcomed.

A simple celebration over a lavish wedding and a shared intention to live gently with the world around us would make the journey feel aligned.

⸻

16. Preferred Method of Contact

You can reach me at the famously self-aware address: iamnotacatch@gmail.com

DMs are welcome too if that feels easier. A short note about who you are and how you see the world would be lovely.",1,1765136259.0,BangladeshMarriage,0,1.0,False

1pgre9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pgre9p/my_work_for_the_government/,My Work For The Government,"With recent disagreements between me and the government over my pension I’ve decided to upload my reports for two cases of my work as a Senior Agent for Project Roanoke. I will be posting this to message boards on the dark, deep and ARC net for efficient archivers to do their best. I will also be uploading an abbreviated version of these reports- excluding names, locations, and titles that would impact how long these posts stay under the radar of the government- to sites like reddit on story boards to frame this story as fictional, once again to buy time. 



A foreword to provide marginal context: Project Roanoke is the oldest of all American Covert-Operations. The Program was originally intended to wipe out the colony of Roanoke after they made peace with surrounding indigenous tribes that other colonies were warring with. This led to the termination of Roanoke so that the tribe would have as few allies as possible and be properly exterminated. It was revived during the Civil War and WW1 to relieve humanity of certain person’s or place’s existence.



I was hired out of a pool of Delta Force soldiers who showed great aptitude for either natural or acquired psychopathy. The government needed people who didn't feel, they got about 15. I started in a crew of 4 guys but was quickly moved to a solo unit with 700 billion tax payer dollars as my budget. 



The missions described here are just a few from my 30 year career and more may come with time. 



\*\*\*



The town formerly known as Camp Freely, Missouri was ransacked and taken over by the Nigh-All Callers Of Heaven cult in May. An incendiary option was considered but with the cult members being so diverse in homeland, it would just be messy. I was dispatched to replace the nuke. 



Being a larger town it required a more invested effort, but would be relatively hands off till the end. 



The procedure was- initially- by the book. Find the family members of every target and kill them or introduce a vegetative-neurotoxin into their morning coffee. This was dependent on age- most elderly people were vegetabilized, but children and adults were killed and framed as random murders, pinned on local youth minorities with a record of violence. Once having the town rendered cut-off from the world began the Infertilenization. 



Adults have slower, but far sturdier metabolisms than children. A dose of fortified-Warfarin to the water supply to the town made the water undrinkable to adults. To the children it would burn off their taste buds- helpful as it meant they wouldn’t be able to taste their own blood- then work through their throat until it reached their stomach. Once in the stomach  it would burn out the stomach lining allowing the stomach acid to do the rest of the dirty work burning out their internals. Sure, it's sad to see children die with their mother’s tears staining their little pale faces, but children are the craftiest and I have no room for craftiness. 



The final portion of this stage is lacing the food with lead. The men would be ill for a day or two, but the women would become infertile. Can’t be having a Moses situation.



Then there was a short period of waiting. This is standard. It gives time for the population to kill themselves or try to leave the town borders. For their gumption- it takes a lot to abandon a cult you’ve been thoroughly indoctrinated in- they are rewarded with a .338 Lapua Magnum round through centermass. Fortunately I only had to kill three runners, and a large portion of the cult either hung themselves or jumped from the water tower. 



This brought me to the final stage of the process. Extermination.



I packed a M4 Beneli shotgun with a backpack full of steel slugs and strapped on a suppressor to the barrel. Sure, it wouldn’t silence the repeated slug-fire, but it would stall any alarm marginally. This, extermination, has a nickname: Door-to-door sales. Each door is usually unlocked in these cult-towns- trust runs deep in them- so it's easy work but boring work. Sometimes they hear you enter and try to defend themselves and die, other times they hear you and welcome the bullet. After about 50 men and women and a few unlucky toddlers, the alarms finally rose. 



They loaded their guns with ammunition I had sabotaged the night before,they tried to run out of the town but couldn’t bring their weak bodies over the razor wire I tied up; cut my finger something nasty while wrapping it up around a bush.



The ones who survived a sabotaged bullet exploding the gun in their hands, didn’t have much fight left and accepted the slug to the head. Once everyone was dead all that remained was the clean up. This part of the job was no longer my problem but I always supervised the process just for certainty’s sake. 



Sure enough, as the Torchers were burning down the homes they found a small crop of new borns the lone fertile mother had birthed during the mass suicides. Torchers don’t have the resolve of Agents, so most began to violently vomit when I used an extra flame thrower to incinerate the mother and her spawn.



Once the homes and structures were ash in the wind, Landscapers came in and laid fresh soil over the burnt land while dogs sniffed out the bones. In 13 short months, all knowledge these people existed was completely erased.



\*\*\*



Most of the times I’ve had people write out their suicide notes they cry and beg but eventully manage to squeeze out some drivel blaming it on a touchy Uncle or something stupid. Other times they’re so emotional they can’t write clearly so I have to learn and copy their handwriting which is a bitch and a half. This guy, however, was relatively understanding. He had blown the whistle on Project Roanoke in June of 1999, but was slow on the draw- put too much thought into which news agency to trust; none of them was the correct answer- so I knocked on his door.



“\*\*\*\*\*\*.” He quivered but still held open the door kindly. He recognized me from the files he had ripped from our servers.



“May I come in?”



“Um… Yes.” I entered and he shut the door; meekly staring at me with some form of desperation I almost accepted.



“How was your day?” 



“Good. I had… dinner with my mom.”



“That’s sweet. What did you guys get?” I asked as I pulled on a beam that divided the roof of his room. 



“Tacos.”



“You prefer tacos or burritos?” I asked as I tossed the rope- purchased on his credit card- over the beam. 



“Tacos.”



“Same. Here.” I passed him a pen and paper. “Write out your suicide note while I tie the noose.”



He hesitated, but eventually took the stationary and sat silently at his desk where he began writing. I heard him come to the realization I had cut his internet connection and wouldn’t be able to upload the documents he had unearthed, sigh with the understanding of why dead-man switches exist, and then watched as he continued writing. 



“Dammit… Hey, I know this is unprofessional but the knot won’t take,” The store had been out of the standard 3-strand braided rope I used to have people hang themselves with, so I bought a ¼ inch 16-strand which refused to knot properly. “Can you hold your finger here?” He stood and pressed his index finger against the cross of the knot. I tied off the knot and he removed his finger, sitting back down silently. 



His note was short, didn’t blame anyone but instead a burdening depression gone unmedicated.

Stepping on to the chair caused the first tears to break out on his face, he pulled the noose on and wiped off the tears as he psyched himself up. “Any questions before you go?”



“Anyway you could just… put me in a cell somewhere?”



“I could, but then I’d have to pass it on to my boss and he’ll have your family and friends killed and all knowledge of your existence erased.” He sighed and nodded.



“Any chance you have some government intel on if God is real?”



“He is, but I doubt the one you want.”

“That’s worse.”

1pgrdfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pgrdfz/the_pit_and_the_owl_part_1/,The Pit and The Owl (part 1),"Richard Carter was a Somerset man through and through, for although he had read many of the books in his local library, he knew no other land than the old county of Somerset, except for a singular trip to the strange—and often peculiar—Cornish countryside. It was on this one-off journey, in his more vigorous and active youth, accompanied by his Jack Russell friend named Biscuit, that Richard encountered a soul-crushing and shocking horror. One which the ordinary human mind, that Richard possessed, could never hope to wholly contain. He witnessed a behemoth so large, and dripping in primordial substance, that poor Richard Carter was forever muted by the terrible experience. And so, for the following pitiful decades of his life, he has not spoken a single word in any language, except for the mumbling machinations of a now mad man, reduced to living in an asylum.

It was on the 23rd of June, in the year of our Lord 1921, that Richard Carter arrived in the Cornish town of St Stephen. And on that day, the air was mild, yet within it, the weight of granite dust hung heavy; the low hills about the place seemed to brood in silence beneath the clear evening sky. St Stephen's, though a modest town, carried a strange dignity in its streets of stone and slate. The cottages leaned together, as long comrades do, and from almost every chimney rose a faint, wavering smoke, that danced in the air. The town’s heart was the venerable Church of St Stephen, its granite tower rising above all other structures like a sentinel from forgotten centuries.

To the northeast of the town, along Trevear Road, is where the land dips into the forested valley of Tregargus. Old folk whisper that the stone of the church must have been quarried from the valley of Tregargus, where ancient mines of unfathomable depth lay buried beneath the moss, yawning like colossal mouths into the underworld. The place, even today, is thick with oaks, whose roots entangle the remnants of the long-deserted dig sites and pits. Footpaths, overgrown and treacherous, twisted towards, and over the Barn river, which had once powered the water wheels of old mills and ore crushers. And to the southwest, across farmland and fields, stood the South Terras Mine—which at the time, was one of the only working mines in all of Britain, where men wrestled with the strange, luminous ore, that the learned call uranium.

Richard took lodging at the Dragonfly Cottage Inn, a squat building of rough stone with ivy clinging to its roof. The front clerk, a gaunt and pale fellow whose eyes seemed to shift uneasily, greeted him with an eerily soft voice. “Good evening, Mr. Carter, correct? Here for room 4 in the attic?” There was, in the man’s manner, a curious disposition, a faint, almost imperceptible agitation, as though he carried some inward knowledge which pressed strongly against his composure.

“Yes, that’s me, and this is Biscuit,” Richard spoke jovially, while lifting up Biscuit to show to the none-too-impressed clerk.

“Sign the ledger and take your key from the rack,” said the clerk, again in an eerily soft voice, while pointing at the open ledger, and then at the wall of keys to his left. Richard signed his name, took his key, and thought little of the interaction, save for a sense of mild unease that lingered as he ascended the narrow stairs to his garret room. There he found a single bed, a wardrobe, and a small desk with a chair facing a small window that looked towards the hills. He settled his bag, fed Biscuit from a tin of meat, and retired for the night.

When morning came, Richard descended into the brightness of the Cornish day, with Biscuit by his side, and headed for breakfast at The King’s Head; it was a modest pub and café situated near the marketplace centre of the town. Choosing a seat outside beneath a leaning oak, he ordered coffee and toast for himself, and a small bowl of dry food for Biscuit, who waited with an eager tail upon the cobbles. The morning was peaceful, yet the townsfolk who passed seemed strangely incurious of Richard—an obvious Englishman in a Celtic land, offering no nod nor greeting. Another man was seated nearby—a broad-shouldered labourer, dressed in worn corduroy, and a linen shirt; he wore a face made coarse by many years, and remarked upon Biscuit’s lively nature. Conversation followed, light at first, until Richard, in that guileless tone unique to travellers, mentioned his plan to take a walking excursion through the Tregargus valley that very afternoon. At this the man’s face altered. The colour fled from his cheeks, and his coarse hands tightened upon the table. He stared at Richard with an expression both alarmed and incredulous, then rose abruptly and began to mutter in a stern but low voice.

“You can’t go there, son. You just can't. No, there aren't any laws or ordinances forbidding it, and I doubt anyone would bother to stop you, but it's...it’s just common sense 'round here, you see. Nobody just goes for a stroll in the valley of Tregargus... especially when daylight's waning. We don’t get many visitors, and not many towns folk ever leave, so, I understand that you wouldn’t know, that you aren’t supposed to go through the valley, unless you are at the end or nearing the end of your life… its, well its, a local tradition of sorts ‘round here. The valley is for the dying.”

After saying his protest to Richard's plan, the man disappeared into the tavern. The silence that followed was deep and peculiar, and Richard, though puzzled by this strange tradition, finished his meal with forced calm, and then left The King's Head, even more interested in going for a walk through the valley.

By late morning, Richard had made his way to the Church of St Stephen-in-Brannel, it was one of the few things of note about the town with any literature written about it, and which Richard had read about back in his hometown’s library. The structure loomed solemn and enduring, its granite walls flecked with lichen and time; within, the air was cool and smelled of age—of candle wax and stone. The nave, with its two aisles supported by heavy arches, and in the dim, half-light, filtered through stained glass, Richard discerned the sturdy Norman font, worn smooth by centuries of baptismal use. Yet what held his gaze the longest was not the font nor the carvings of saints, but a curious symbol etched upon one of the beams—a circular pattern of remarkable intricacy, depicting, or so it seemed, a pit or void into the very depth of the earth, from which lines radiated outward like tendrils, grasping onto the surrounding landscape and trees, dragging them into the depths. It conveyed a sensation of falling, and ingestion, that disturbed Richard’s mind; and as he studied this strange mark, Biscuit began to bark sharply, his gaze fixed upon the rafters of the church. The echoes of Biscuit's voice rose and shivered through the silent church until Richard, feeling suddenly unwelcome and wishing to calm his canine friend, hastily led his companion out into the daylight once more.

Richard then decided that his best course of action would be to wander through the lanes of St Stephens, in hopes of finding a familiar site, that is, a place not short of books. And soon, Richard found himself passing a small bookshop, whose window displayed a disorderly array of faded volumes, some old some new, and which thankfully had a pet’s welcome sign neatly attached to the door; he entered, seeking some volumes of the antiquarian vein. The shop was dim and cramped, the shelves crowded near to collapse, a small desk placed in the far corner, behind which sat a woman, who wore a subtle smile, awaited to make a sale. Taking a book at random, he blew the dust from its cover and read the title: *A History of Mining and Excavations in Cornwall*.

“That’s a good one,” spoke the woman, in a surprisingly shrill voice, provoking both Richard and Biscuit to flinch, then turn to face the woman. “It’s an old volume, printed in 1724. It covers the long history of mining here in Cornwall, from the ancient tin mines to the use of early hard rock mining, even has a short chapter on St Stephen itself.” At this Richard begin to turn the pages idly and shortly came upon the chapter devoted to the parish of St Stephen-in-Brannel. There he read of the deep mines of Tregargus—how men had begun to use dynamite to delve far below the Earth’s surface, until strange lights were seen in the tunnels, and workers began to vanish without trace. By 1715, it said, the shafts were sealed, and a rumour spread among the locals of rocks that glowed faintly in the dark, as if some unholy fire burned deep within the stone. Richard closed the book slowly, checked his watch and saw it had just passed noon, prompting him to return the book to its place on the shelf and head outside.

The sun was high in the sky, and the bells of St Stephen’s church began to toll their ancient and solemn call for worship. Not being a particular religious man, and now feeling quite hungry since his light breakfast, Richard decided to return to The Kings Head. He took a seat inside and ordered his lunch—a hearty steak pie with mashed potato and a pint of ale—he offered a few morsels of meat to Biscuit beneath the table. Yet as he ate, he became aware of voices from the bar, the same man from that morning, now in the company of several others. They spoke low, and when Richard approached in friendly a manner, all conversation ceased. One by one, the men turned to him, their expressions blank and unwelcoming. The silence was total. Feeling the full weight of their stares, Richard muttered some apology and left. But he couldn’t shake the feeling they had impressed upon him, and he thought “was to walk into Tregargus while healthy and able, really such a terrible violation of local custom?” then an incredulous feeling overcame such a thought “it was public woodlands, no laws or ordinances prevented me from sauntering through, so why should I not?”

And so, Richard and Biscuit made their way to Trevaer road the road to Tregargus. It proceeded gently upward and passed the church for some 20 minutes, then dipped into the wooded valley. It was a place of sombre beauty: shafts of sunlight piercing the foliage, moss-covered stones, the hum of unseen woodland creatures, and the soft gurgle of water, of streams and the Barn river. Midway across a narrow bridge that spanned one such stream, Biscuit again began barking furiously, twisting and turning his head in all directions, then turning his eyes to gaze up at the canopy above. Richard glanced upwards and attempted to ascertain even a fleeting shadow of what had stirred Biscuit to such fury, then something glided swiftly between the trees and vanished into the higher branches, but still Richard could not see and identify what the creature was, leaving him with an unease he could not name. The stillness of the valley seemed to deepen thereafter, and with it came an inexplicable dread, not wishing to linger, or cause Biscuit any more trouble, Richard turned back toward the town, towards the Dragonfly Cottage Inn for rest.

And so ended Richards first proper day in St Stephens—seemingly uneventful for Richard Carter, who, in the half-forgotten hours of the day, had just first felt the shadow of that which was to come; and the creature which had provoked such a frenzy in Biscuit, which had alluded Richards eyes, was a humble tawny owl. This owl would be the thing to bring doom to poor Richard Carter.",3,1765136174.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

1pgr9xv,https://i.redd.it/vika100b3u5g1.jpeg,"CraftCFO Week 24 | Every Board Meeting Has a Job (And It's Not ""Update the Board"")","***I'm writing this from a new arabic coffee shop, staring at what might be the most beautiful cup of coffee I've ever been served.*** *Golden tray, intricate cezve, the whole ceremony. The barista placed it down like she was presenting something sacred. Whoever designed this experience, they clearly cared about something.*

*Just not the coffee.*

*Because the coffee is bad, watered down, lukewarm. I peeked into the kitchen, omg they're boiling it in a kettle and pouring it into the pretty pot. The cezve is just a prop.*

*And I'm not even mad. I'm just sitting here thinking.*

___

Because I've done exactly what this coffee shop did.

I've built the beautiful vessel. I've assembled the ceremony. I've placed the tray down in front of a board and watched them receive it: politely, respectfully, the way you receive something that looks like it matters.

Sixty-two slides, that was my first real board deck. I remember the CFO and I asking our sponsor for a template, someone else's structure, we filled it in like a coloring book. Marketing, sales, finance, product updates. Appendix. Appendix to the appendix.

The meeting went fine. Which is another way of saying it wasn't.

""Fine"" means no one got what they needed. ""Fine"" means everyone performed their role. The board performed listening. We performed updating. And then everyone went home and nothing changed.

Two weeks later, our CEO told us the board had asked her the same three questions we'd spent an hour on. ""We gave them a report,"" she said. ""We didn't give them a point of view.""

___

I think about that a lot, actually. The difference between a report and a point of view.

A report is: here's what happened. A point of view is: here's what we believe, and here's what we're asking you to believe with us.

A report asks the board to receive. A point of view asks them to engage.

And engagement is uncomfortable. It means they might disagree, push back, poke holes. It means you might be wrong in public, in front of the people whose money you're spending.

So we hide, we hide behind comprehensiveness, behind templates. Behind forty slides that say ""we're on top of things"" without ever saying what we actually think.

___

A board member told me once (we were grabbing coffee, which is funny now, sitting here) he said: ""I sit on six boards. Every deck looks the same. I retain maybe 10% of what I see.""

I asked which decks he remembered.

""The ones where I walk out thinking about one thing,"" he said. ""Not forty.""

Then he asked me what I actually needed from the last board meeting. And I didn't have an answer. I'd never asked what the meeting was *for*. I'd only asked what the deck was supposed to contain. Those are different questions. I didn't know that then.

___

**EVERY BOARD MEETING HAS A JOB TO DO**

Here's what I've learned: **every board meeting has a job to do.** Not ""update the board."" An actual job.

When investors wrote the check, they underwrote a thesis. Maybe ""this team can crack enterprise sales."" Or ""this model has 70% margins at scale."" Or ""geographic density unlocks unit economics."" Whatever it was, that's the bet they made.

Every board meeting is an update on that thesis, validating it, stress-testing it, evolving it, or admitting it was wrong.

Now I do this thing, it's almost embarrassing how simple it is, I write one sentence before I open any template:

**""The job of this meeting is to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.""**

Not ""provide a Q4 update."" That's a calendar invite, not a job.

Something that *shapes* the company:

* _...build confidence we can expand regionally without breaking unit economics.""_
* _...get alignment that the pivot is worth the short-term margin hit.""_
* _...decide whether to extend runway or double down._

If I can't finish the sentence, I don't build slides. Because if I don't know the job, I'm just putting on decoration.

___

**THE JOB CHANGES, IT'S NOT STATIC**

Early stage, you're proving the thesis is playing out. Customer signals, early wins, leading indicators. The board walks in asking: *Was our bet right?*

Scaling, you're building confidence in execution. Systems under stress, hiring velocity, ops capacity. The board walks in asking: *Can they actually pull this off?*

Pre-fundraise, you're setting up the next narrative. What's de-risked, what's next, why now. The board walks in asking: *What's the story for new investors?*

(Book rec: Damodaran's *Narrative and Numbers*)

___

**I LIVED THROUGH THAT**

I lived through a market pivot at previous company. We'd built a solid wellness business, think early Talkspace or Noom, that had an explosive growth, but then quickly hit a ceiling. The market was more niche than we'd hoped. But we'd built solid clinical infrastructure, and we saw an adjacent market exploding.

The board meeting where we made the pivot, our CEO opened cold: ""The thesis you underwrote is dead. Here's the new one.""

The room went quiet. And then, for the first time in my career, I watched a board actually engage. They argued, they pushed back, and we ended up stress-testing every assumption. Because we'd given them something to engage with. A point of view. An argument for a new future.

The deck had no department headers. Every slide answered one question: *can we win in this new market?*

They got on board (heh). Not because we'd convinced them, but because we'd invited them to think alongside us.

___

*I'm still sitting here. Coffee's cold now. Not that it was ever hot.*

*I keep looking at this cezve. It really is beautiful. Someone designed it with care. Someone thought about the curves, the weight, the way light catches the engraving.*

*They just forgot what it was for.*

___

**ONE THING TO TRY**

It's Q4. You're probably building a deck right now, or will be soon.

Before you add another slide, try this once. Just once. Write the sentence:

**""The job of this meeting is to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.""**

See what happens to the deck. If you can finish it with something specific, every slide either advances that job or doesn't belong.

If you can't...

Well, you've seen what happens. Beautiful vessel, nothing inside.

Three days before the wedding, I went to try on my gown. It was a white dress with an elaborate design with lots of laces and le on the skirt. As the seamstress pinned the sides and adjusted the length. I looked in the mirror and felt excited. I anted to show it to Craig, and see his face light up when he saw it. There was nothing I didn’t share with him.

1pgr5b6,https://harvee.app/blog/what-your-sleep-data-really-means-for-stress,What Sleep Data Really Means for Stress,"Most of us wake up, glance at our sleep score, and immediately decide how to feel about the day.

“78? I guess I’m… moderately functional.”

“62? Cancel everything.”

“91? Today I will accomplish things.”

Sleep data is everywhere now: smartwatches, rings, apps and it creates this illusion that a simple number can summarize your entire night. But here’s the strange truth: the relationship between sleep and stress is way more interesting, way more annoying, and way more useful than a single score can show.

If you want to understand your stress, you have to understand what your sleep data is actually telling you. And what it isn’t. Let’s unpack it without the usual wellness buzzwords or doom-and-gloom.

1. You Don’t Sleep in “Quality” or “Not Quality”

Sleep trackers love categories like deep sleep, REM, light, “you moved too much,” “you breathed weird,” and so on. But the science is messier. These stages aren’t neat boxes. They’re more like a fluid cycle your brain drifts through for recovery, memory consolidation, and emotional processing. Your device is making very educated guesses about these stages based on movement and heart rate patterns, not scanning your brain waves in real time.

So if your app says you got 14 minutes of deep sleep and you suddenly think you’re dying… relax. Deep sleep estimates from wearables can be off by quite a bit. What is reliable is the overall pattern:

• How long you slept

• How consistent your nights are

• How your heart rate and HRV behaved

• How rested you actually feel

Your stress lives in that pattern not in one number.

2. The Real Stress Signal Often Shows Up Before You Even Wake Up

Nighttime is when your system does its quiet housekeeping: repairing tissues, balancing hormones, clearing metabolic junk, and sorting out emotional residue from the day. If stress is building in the background, even the kind you’re “too busy to notice”, it shows up in your sleep long before it shows up in your mood.

A few examples researchers consistently find:

• Lower HRV at night

This often means your system is still stuck in “go mode.” The brakes never fully engaged.

• Elevated overnight heart rate

Your body might still be processing stimulation: caffeine, alcohol, big training day, late-night coding sprint, or a spiral of worrying about your future taxes.

• More restlessness

This is your nervous system leaking tension. You’re not awake, but you’re not settled either.

These signals often appear before you feel stressed. Which is simultaneously helpful and rude.

3. Stress Doesn’t Just Disrupt Sleep. Sleep Disrupts Stress

Most people think stress → bad sleep. But lack of sleep also amplifies stress the next day. It hits your amygdala (your threat-scanning center) and reduces the communication between your prefrontal cortex and your emotional regulation system.

Translation:

Poor sleep makes normal challenges feel like personal attacks. You know those days where the coffee machine drips wrong and you question every life choice? Yeah, that’s insufficient sleep talking.

The cycle works like this:

Bad sleep → reduced resilience → more stress → another bad night → more reduced resilience → repeat until you explode or take a nap.

Breaking that loop isn’t about perfection; it’s about recognizing when you’re in it.

4. The Most Helpful Sleep Metrics for Stress (And the Ones You Can Ignore)

Useful

• Resting heart rate (RHR)

Lower overnight RHR usually means your body recovered well.

• Heart rate variability (HRV)

Think of HRV as your recovery bandwidth. Higher overnight HRV usually means you’re ready for more load—mental, emotional, or physical.

• Sleep regularity

The time you go to bed often matters more than how long you sleep. The brain loves consistency.

• Total sleep time

Quantity still matters. Adults aren’t special; we need 7–9 hours.

Not worth obsessing over

• Exact minutes of each sleep stage

Fun to look at, unreliable to interpret.

• “Sleep efficiency” down to the decimal

Being up for 9 minutes versus 14 minutes is not a sign of your life falling apart.

• One bad night

Single nights don’t matter. Trends do.

5. What to Actually Do With Your Sleep Data

You don’t need to become a sleep scientist. But these few habits can help you understand your stress through the lens of sleep:

Check your trend, not your last night.
Two weeks of slight decline tells you far more than one terrible Tuesday.

Pair your data with your lived experience.
Did you feel tired? Wired? Calm? Your interpretation + the data = the real picture.

Notice early patterns.
If your HRV keeps dipping and your resting heart rate keeps rising, that’s your system whispering, “Hey, slow down.” You can still ignore it, of course. Humans are great at that.

Give your body conditions it responds well to:
• A consistent bedtime

• A wind-down routine that doesn’t involve doom scrolling

• Less late-night caffeine

• More daylight during the morning

• Actual breaks during the day so your nervous system isn’t doing all its recovery at 2 a.m.

Small things matter a lot because your nervous system cares about patterns, not perfection.

6. Sleep Data Isn’t a Scorecard. It’s a Conversation

The most important point is this:

Your sleep data isn’t judging you. It’s trying to help you understand the story your body is telling. If your nights are getting lighter, choppier, or more restless, it doesn’t mean you’re failing. It means stress is showing up somewhere, maybe mentally, maybe physically, maybe both.

And if your sleep starts stabilizing and your HRV climbs, that’s your body saying, “Hey, whatever you’re doing… keep doing it.”

Your sleep isn’t a grade. It’s feedback. And once you understand that, you can respond instead of react.",4,1765135637.0,HarveeApp,0,1.0,False

I’m not sure where the feature wall should end. Should it stop at the pony wall, continue to the fireplace, or run along the entire length of the wall?

INSULA STREET

A plastic rose placed in a vase of fresh flowers

JULY 21ST

“Alright ben, goodnight”  I said as I slung my backpack over my shoulder and checked my phone. Nothing but a spam text notification. 8 hour shift and not a single text, nice. Starting my classy 03 Altima up, I slid out a cigarette from the carton. 3 left, wonderful. I started the drive home with the radio on at first, but quickly turned it off, I wanted some silence after 8 hours of listening to customers yap about the sodium content in guacamole. It’s only been 3 weeks working at Filthy Phils and i already felt like I was capped out. I wanted to quit, but I couldn’t. It was my fifth job this year, and I had to stop my habit of quitting jobs just because I was bored. It’s not like making burritos is exciting but at least it’s better than cleaning an old geezers watery diarrhea off the floor at a nursing home. If I made it 3 weeks at Anne Rosemary Nursing Home., I could at least double it making some damn tacos. While trying to get that sickening memory out of my head, I noticed a dog walking along the street. Probably a stray I thought as I slowed down. I rolled my window down and called at it. The mutt paused and turned towards me. Its face was full of scabs and puss, and it had a red plastic Clifford looking dog toy in its mouth. Jeez somebodies gotta put that thing down I thought as I rolled my window back up and started chugging along. I glanced at the rearview out of a sick curiosity. The dog, now sitting with his brittle hind legs folded up under him, was biting into the plastic toy, ragging its head around, cracking the plastic into sharp pieces. Red daggers flying everywhere, splatting his own blood all over its snout and the dying grass surrounding it. Fucking sick, must be rabies or something. By the time I pulled into my driveway, the sky was fading into evening. I kicked off my shoes and poured a beer into a mug. The TV flickered with a half forgotten movie. I sank into the couch, letting the hum of the fridge and the soft ticking of the clock fill the room. I shot up to the sound of the mug hitting my floor. I felt a deep pump of blood from my heart. I must have knocked out with it in my hand, scared the shit out of myself like an idiot. The TV was playing some cartoon with a guy with a huge head. Looks like Pete from work I thought, laughing to myself. Shutting it off and grabbing the somehow unbroken mug from the floor, rinsing it off and leaving it on my countertop, I made my way upstairs to get ready for bed. I must’ve laid in bed for 3 or 4 hours staring at the ceiling fan  as it traced slow, lazy circles, drifting in and out of slumber . As I was finally beginning to feel the weight of sleep in the back  my eyes I heard a shuffling sound coming from what sounded like my attic. Peeling my eye lids open I lifted my head off my pillow to listen in. “Pat, Pat…. Shuffle… Pat.. Pat, Pat...” It must be some squirrels or a raccoon I thought. Annoyed, I took another 4 melatonin pills and shoved my face back into my pillow trying to drown the sound out by focusing on the sound of my ceiling fan. 



JULY 23RD

Another slow, dragging 8 hour shift had gone by, and I was heading my way back home again, with a shooting headache. Turning on the stop sign I saw something that made the back of my neck itch. It was the dog. Now kicked over to the side of the road against the curb. Its chest looked like it had popped open like a balloon. The asphalt around it painted a now muddy red. One of its forelegs pointed forward, the other one snapped back under its torso almost touching its hip. I was sick. I stomped the accelerator, not wanting to be anywhere near, or accidentally taking another look.



JULY 26TH

 The jingle of my alarm shot me awake. 1:00PM… Damn I’m a loser. I had today off so I started my morning slow. I Sat around in my underwear for a bit scrolling on my phone. Brushed my teeth in the shower and made a cup of coffee while watching a few minutes of whatever was on the TV. After I finished my coffee I went over to grab the papers from my mailbox. Flipping through the first one, I noticed the headlines were gone. Every word, every number, every little blurb, blank. Boxes, borders, photos, all still there. Just… empty. I dropped it back down, checking the next one. Same thing. It must’ve been a printing error I thought, but it gave me a faint feeling in my gut. Tossing them onto my countertop I fixed myself a pot of fresh coffee for today and tomorrow. I couldn’t shake the thought of that dog. Ive seen road kill before but never that close. That… visceral. I pushed the image to the back of my brain as I poured myself another cup. I spent the rest of the evening dwindling around switching from watching TV, scrolling on my phone and playing video games. The sky was blended into darkness as I did the rounds shutting off the lights outside my house, closing blinds and locking the front door. As I was making my way up the stairs to go to bed I heard it again. “Pat, Pat…. Shuffle… Pat.. Pat, Pat…” This time it sounded like it was coming from the wall, or maybe in gutter. I made a note to myself to grab some rodent repellent as I angrily brushed my teeth and slipped into bed. For what felt like hours the sound repeated:  “Pat, Pat…. Shuffle… Pat.. Pat, Pat…” a break of silence “Pat, Pat…. Shuffle… Pat.. Pat, Pat…” over and over until I couldn’t take it. I shot up out of bed pushing the blinds aside and popping open my rarely opened window and pushed my head out looking up towards the gutter. Saw nothing, heard nothing. I slapped my hand against the siding of the house a few times hoping to scare them off. As I was twisting the crank handle to shut the window something caught my attention, My neighbours lights were on. Adjusting my eyes, I saw my him... closely pressed up against a wall, his face just barely an inch from it, thighs squeezing tightly against it. I bent down, just peering my eyes above the window sill. “Pat, Pat…. Shuffle… Pat.. Pat, Pat…” He was walking into the wall. His knees hitting it each time he lifted a leg. The tip of his nose and forehead brushing the wall. I felt like throwing up. My eyes watered, heat crept up from the bottom of my stomach to my face. “Pat, Pat…. Shuffle… Pat.. Pat, Pat…” I backed way on all fours till I reached my stairs with my mind racing, feeling like an animal who just saw its mother eaten. I walked down my stairs, weak-footed, panicked. What was he doing? Is he sick? He’s an old man but is that something old men do when they’re sick? I paced around, wired, not knowing if I’m overreacting or if the dread I’m feeling was justified. I paced for what could have been an hour. Until my brain shut down, I couldn’t think anymore. I settled on the couch. I laid there blank finally falling asleep when the night was starting to merge with the morning.



JULY 27TH

My house was cold. I must have left my bedside window open after what happened last night. I was still shaken, but I was starting to calm down. I was being unreasonable. He was a dementia stricken old man. It was the light playing tricks on me. I rationalized with myself while making myself a bowl of cereal. His name was Robert, my neighbour. I never really spoke to him; didn’t know much about him. Just a cordial nod or a good morning. He was forgettable, not the type of guy to leave a big impression.  After finishing my cereal, angry with my self for being such a pussy I finally decided to go upstairs to shut the window.  Roberts blinds were closed. He had no car. I guess when you get that old you kinda enjoy getting around on your feet. Not much else to do.



JULY 31ST 

I got fired. I guess I’ve been noticeably drudging around work the past few days because I got a call this morning telling me not to come in and that I’ll get my pay check in the mail sometime this week. I wasn’t even upset. Ive been on this on and off cycle of work for years now. I’m confident I’ll be washing dishes or restocking shelves somewhere in a few weeks anyway, it’s all the same to me. I drove down to a pub for a few drinks. After a few hours of staring into my cold glass and some short conversations with some fat truckers, I left. With a little buzz, driving home, I accidentally took the route I’ve been avoiding the past week. Some kid was poking the dead mutt with a stick. I slowed down and pressed on my horn trying to scare the kid off. He just looked at me all bewildered, like I walked in on him taking a piss. He broke his gaze off me and stared back down at the dead thing. Pushing the stick into its flayed out chest, a brown chunk sliding out of its torso onto the road. I just kept driving, shaking my head. What the fuck is wrong with kids these days?

By the time I twisted the key and popped open my front door, the sky was fuligin. As I was stepping in I kicked aside the stack of papers I forgot to pick up this morning. I gathered them and flipped through them. Regular. Some dumb, grinning realtor in a blazer talking about  new condos. Toilet paper on sale. 



AUGUST 1ST

Id just finishing mowing my backyard when I noticed a soccer ball bounce on the top of my fence and land in my yard. I saw the kid peep over the fence giving me a look. “You sent that pretty high up buddy” I said walking over. I grabbed the ball, gave it a brush and tossed it back over. “There you go.” The boy didn’t reply, he just stared at me like I was some unicorn. Weird kid, I thought as I started the walk down the narrow alley between our houses. That’s when I caught the low hum of voices from an open window. I wasn’t trying to listen, but the words brushed past me anyway, thin as threads. “He’s getting very good,” the mother said, her voice dipping into something I couldn’t catch. A soft answer from the dad, swallowed by the room.  “I just want to clap,” he said. “You know he held his breath all night. He’s such a good boy.” Another muffled reply. I couldn’t make it out. Something about it slid right under my skin. I eased the fence gate shut behind me, quieter than I meant to. I don’t know why. It felt wrong to let anything make noise, like they’d hear me, like it mattered. What were they talking about? Holding his breath all night? Maybe I misheard. But the words carried a strange weight. Getting ready for bed I kept replaying them, that little electric sting at the base of my spine. I must have heard it wrong.

1pgqxqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pgqxqr/no_one_gets_out_alive/,No One Gets Out Alive,"A deep darkness surrounded him, suffocating in its solidity. Headlights created a slight reprieve, illuminating the road before him, yellow beams casting the visible world in an unnatural hue. Cracked and deserted asphalt lay ahead of him, traveled only by those who knew what a long drive really *meant*. 

Cool air rushed past his face, banishing the stuffy desert heat creeping into his cabin. The sun had just gone down, so the temperature was still uncomfortably hot. Yet soon, he’d have to turn the heaters on instead as the night chill set in. 

He sang along to the music that filled the cabin, mouthing the lyrics with ease.

“*No stop signs, speed limit, nobody’s gonna slow me down.*”

His lukewarm cup of coffee was almost empty now as he took another sip. He shifted in his seat, settling further into the hypnotic frequency of tires hitting the road. He knew he’d fall asleep at the wheel listening to it if he let himself. 

His phone buzzed again, adding to the long list of missed calls and texts. He sighed and turned it off. The fallout was worse than he thought it would be. His breakup had been messy, and he sported a few new bruises as penance. He had run away once again. He never faced the problem, always turned his back and let it happen. Never listening to his friend's warnings. 

His RV was his safe space. It was a sanctuary, a bubble all to himself that could take him away from reality. His destination was not predetermined; he just wanted to be as far away from his home as possible. The highway he was on now was his salvation. 

Taking the last sip of his coffee, he fumbled with the empty cup, sending it down to the passenger seat floor. Grumbling, trying to keep his eyes on the road, he bent over to fish around for the cup. Instead, he almost impaled his eye on the straw sticking out of the other cup in the holder. 

“Fuck” He muttered while jerking away. *That could have been bad.* Foregoing the cup–he planned to get it when he was parked–he steeled himself and focused on his music.

“*Nobody’s gonna mess me around\~”* 

The light warbled and flickered before him as he passed over uneven ground, creating an unnerving atmosphere. His eyes followed the dull images of indiscernible shadows dancing about, his brain determined to make something out of them. 

He was used to this. He had often run away from his problems, getting on the road and driving well into dusk. He had become accustomed to his mind's tendency to create fake fantasies and ideas out of the shadows. Glancing up at the sky, the best part of night drives reveals itself: the sky alight with countless stars, painting a beautiful portrait of the universe. 

He looked back down, glancing at his gas gauge. He grimaced. It was much lower than he had thought when he took off. He had no real idea of where a gas station would be, so he prayed one would show up soon.

He sighed deeply, returning to the monotonous drive.



\*\*\*



His gauge confirmed his fears; his fuel was now dangerously low. But fate was on his side. An oasis appeared, cutting through the darkness. The bright sign of a truck stop illuminated the air around it down the road, practically glowing with promise. His nerves were starting to fray because of the amount of caffeine he had consumed, and the stress of gas problems only added to them.  

He reached into the glove box, pulled out a container of Advil, and popped two into his mouth, swallowing them dry. *I need to fill up on them again.* 

As he got closer, he saw a small building. The roof above the gas pumps was attached to it, and fluorescent lights blanketed the dull concrete and metal of the station. Surprisingly, around the back, he could see a large parking lot with many spaces occupied. 

He wondered why there were so many cars out here at this time of night, at this seemingly random location. Pulling up to the station, he saw that the small store was empty save for an older woman reading a book behind the counter, not looking up as his loud RV pulled up next to one of the gas pumps. 

Shutting off the engine brought a deathly silence. After hours of driving, the lack of engine hum was disconcerting. Every other noise seemed louder like his keys jingling and the locks disengaging. They now sounded like gunshots in this silence. 

His surroundings were unnaturally white. The harsh fluorescent lights hurt his eyes, making his headache worse. The hum of electricity in the air was quiet but constant. He took a deep breath in, happy to finally stretch his legs. The sharp smell of gasoline filled his nose, and it permeated throughout the station. 

A glint in the corner of his eye caught his attention. Lying on the floor next to the pump was a battered driver's license. He bent over and picked it up. The name and address had been crudely scratched out, and a giant wall of a man filled the top right frame. As he was bent over inspecting the license a small shift in his periphery made him look towards his RV. A shadow moved on the other side of his RV, he barely caught the edge of it as he looked under his car. 

It looked like a pair of shoes. His heartbeat sped up slightly; *where did this guy come from?* 

“Hello?” No answer was received; his lone voice echoing through the station. 

He tried again.

Silence.

 He carefully moved towards the front of his car, keeping his eye on the shadowy feet peeking underneath. The shadows moved, taking a step towards the rear of the car mirroring his movements. He took a step forward, the shadow took one back. 

“Hey what is your problem man!” He shouted. *What the hell kind of game is this!* He kept his head where he could see under the car as he got closer to the hood, getting ready to bolt around the front and catch the interloper before they could round the back and escape his sight. 

Once he was close enough he bent his legs and dashed around the front. 

“Hey!” 

There was just empty air. He dropped to the ground looking under the car to find where the interloper went. Scanning the lot from his position on the floor he found nothing amiss throughout the station. 

“What the…” he muttered to himself.

Getting up he ran around the back to check the other side again. Only an empty station met him. *God dammit, am I seeing things?* He took a deep breath, grounding himself. A throbbing beat filled his ears. Pressing the palms of his callused hands to his eye sockets he tried to will away the pounding in his head.

He stalked over to the entrance, the clear glass sliding doors squealing in protest as they opened; a garbled chime announced his arrival. Ratty, yellowed, linoleum-lined floors with the corners peeling up near the walls. The small shop looked like any old gas stop, with junk food high in calories, a coffee machine, cigarettes lining the wall behind the counter, chips galore, and some dubious packaged sushi. Fridges lined the wall directly across from him, and sodas, energy drinks, beers, and alcohol were at the far end.

To his left, the wiry old woman he saw through the glass still had her nose in her book, not even glancing up when he walked in. She looked like a ghost, with sallow skin drenched in white light, and the bags under her drooping eyes were deep with fatigue. Her hair was thinning with fading brown streaks that were swallowed by the sea of grey. A well-worn flannel was draped over her shoulders, the seams starting to come apart at the edges. 

Her presence was almost negligible, her form blending in like a part of the station. Taking a breath and pulling out his wallet, he stared at the lack of bills. A thinning twenty and a few loose ones were all that was left. Grabbing the lost license and his last bill, he walked over to the counter. His shoes click, echoing in the silence.  

“I found this outside on the floor next to pump one,” he slid over the license. “Oh, also, can I get pump one? I promise not to drop *my* license while I'm out there,” he chuckled, placing the bill on the decrepit counter and shifting awkwardly at the silence. Lottery tickets that looked like relics collected dust under the glass, their fading colors dull and lifeless. The woman slowly raised her head, putting a finger between the pages and closing the book. Her sharp blue eyes bore into him and were full of life and vigor. 

As her eyes passed over the license, her body froze for a moment, her knuckles gripping the book turning white, and she looked up at him with tired eyes.

“Another new face, huh?” She asked with a slight sniffle. 

“Uh, yeah, never been around here before.” 

The woman scoffed and looked at him sorrowfully before steeling her expression to a neutral one. 

“Then let me tell you the rules.” She took an old used lottery ticket, stuck it into the saved space in her book, and put it off to the side. She folded her arms on the counter and leaned forward. 

“The rules?” He asked incredulously.

“Take it as ya will. I'm just givin’ ya the information to survive.” Her tone was even, the content of her words and inflection clashing. 

“Survive?” 

The old woman leaned back, her chair squeaking and groaning. She breathed deeply, “Just listen, alright, don't interrupt me.” The old woman looked at him, waiting for a response.

“Okay…” he drew out the word in a questioning manner. “Whatever passes the hours, I guess, but I need to head out, busy night and all that.” He said while gesturing vaguely with his hand. The uneasiness he had been feeling was now creeping back, stronger, and he wanted to get out of there quickly. 

“There's gonna be a hitchhiker on the road outta here. You *have* to pick him up. It's not an if. You *will* pick him up. Do not under any circumstances talk to him.” Her voice became stern and powerful, showing a seriousness she had not before. “Don't look at him too much either. He doesn't like that. If he tells ya he's at his destination, stop immediately and let him out. If he talks to ya outside of tellin' ya his drop-off point, don't respond.” Her face was serious, her brow furrowed while her blue eyes drilled into him. 

“Okay.” He looked at the old woman, his eyebrow quirked up. He didn't know what the hell she was talking about, chalking it up to the crazed ramblings of an old woman. “Can I just get this on pump one, please?” He said, tapping the bill on the counter.

The old woman scoffed and took the bill from him. Spinning around in her chair to open the register, she said with an even voice again, “Don't say I didn't warn ya, just tryna help.” 

“Yea. Thanks.” He said with a hint of sarcasm. The old woman grumbled as she busied herself with the register and computer. 

“Alright, pumps ready.” The old woman looked back into his eyes. There was something there—fear? Sadness? Pity? He couldn't tell; this situation worsened his headache, and the pounding in his ears became louder. 

The cool night air hit him in full force when he stepped outside. The day's residual heat was gone, and the wind now had a sharp edge as he walked to the pump. 

Opening the door to the RV, he pulled the gas tank switch and shut the driver's side door. The loud bang of its closing startled him as the sound echoed through the station like a beacon, alerting any horrors that may lay beyond the lights. He unrooted himself from the floor and trudged over to the nozzle. Picking it up, he took a calming breath, the scent of gasoline stronger now, making him wince. 

Shaking his head, he inserted the nozzle into the tank and pressed the cheapest option. The machine whirred, and the flow of liquid could be heard faintly filling the tank.  

Shadows danced around him as he waited, insect silhouettes creating images on the station's floor, making him uneasy. He kept scanning the station as he waited, feeling like someone was watching him. The pump clicked, snapping him from his stupor, signaling that his meager twenty had been used up. Putting the pump back, he beelined it for his cabin, shutting the door quickly behind him.

*What is with this place? That shadow–and that woman! I've had some weird clerks before, but that one took the cake. What was with the odd rules? You're gonna pick up a hitchhiker? Yeah, I'm not doin' that. I don't need your cryptic nonsense, lady. God, this place is weirding me out.* With shaky hands, he fumbled the key into the ignition, putting the car into drive. 

He pushed down harder than he meant to on the gas, jerking him back into his seat. He sped out of there, happy to leave the place behind. Looking in the side mirror, he saw the lot full of cars again. He hadn't even thought about it while in the station. *Where were all of those people? Surely they didn’t leave their cars there and walk away, right?*

As he drove, his mind kept returning to what the old woman had said, like a song stuck in his head.

*“No stop signs, speed limit\~”*

He scoffed as he remembered the song's name. 

*Huh. This really does feel like a highway to hell.* 

The warnings repeated. 

*Pick him up. Don't talk to him. Don't look at him. Drop him off when he tells you.*

The car was utterly silent, besides the engine hum. The air was stagnant and dry. His eyes were red and uncomfortable as the road moved underneath him. 

Movement down the road caught his attention, his eyes locking onto the object that stuck out in its surroundings. His whole body clenched. *No way. Right?* He slowed the car down, unable to determine what caught his attention. The car was at a crawl as the headlight's edges crept closer and closer to the shadowy movement. Leaning forward, he squinted, trying to make any details out. The lights crept up the silhouette as he got closer.

And closer.

And closer.

He saw a degraded mannequin standing upright, its arms missing with colorful spray paint and myriad stickers covering it. 

He let out a breath he hadn't known he'd been holding. He laughed hysterically at his gullibility for falling for this little prank. Someone had set up a fake hitchhiker down the road, and judging by how vandalized it was, this had happened before. *God, why did I get so scared over this? What a fucking joke!*

He didn't look back as he passed it. 

Continuing his drive, he tried to forget about the little prank. Still, his mind kept returning to it. His mind was determined to make something out of every little movement and shadow he saw. He tried to tell himself that it was just a joke, it wasnt real. He saw the proof: the mannequin purposefully placed down from the gas reason enough. It was made to do one thing.

To scare him. 

He wouldn't let it.

Another flash of movement caught his attention. He didn't look at it, willing his mind to stop making up possibilities of what it could be. As the lights passed over it, his whole body froze.

A man with his arm extended, thumb up, and smile on his face.

He was emaciated, his white skin seemingly transparent in the glow of the headlights. He had a worn denim jacket with a white shirt underneath. The shirt was thin and stained, while the coat had multiple embroidered patches running down the side of the sleeve. A pair of black slacks and black shoes finished off his nondescript outfit. 

His face looked like everyone and no one simultaneously, and he couldn't pin down his features as if they had moved and shifted with the light. His eyes were black as he stared at the RV, tracking its approach. He wore an ear-to-ear grin, making them crinkle at the edges. His yellowing teeth on full display. Greasy brown hair stuck to his forehead and around his ears. 

His skin prickled at the sight of him, his breath hitching. The man kept smiling and holding up his thumb as he got closer. Ignoring him, he looked back to the road ahead, pressing harder on the gas pedal. He couldn't help but glance as the hitchhiker passed his window, his smile still agonizingly wide. It looked like an imitation, with no real emotion or kindness behind it, just an empty shell. He watched as the hitchhiker grew smaller and smaller in the rearview mirror, finally letting out a deep breath and easing up on the gas when the darkness swallowed him up. The man had made no moves besides the slow turning of his head as he watched the RV pass.

He let out a hysterical chuckle as his heart pounded in his chest, pushing the fear and uneasiness behind him. *Wow, what a fucking coincidence, that scared the shit outta me! God, if that woman saw how bad that got me, she probably be laughing her ass off.* He clenched his hands, and anger started to build up. He didn't need this extra stress. Steadying his mind, he continued driving, the road wobbling and the engine firing. 

A figure lit up down the road. His blood ran cold when he realized it was a hitchhiker with his arm out, thumb up, and a smile on his face—the same person he had just passed. *How in the hell did he get back in front of me?* 

A feeling of dread washed over him as he crept closer to the hitchhiker. He pressed the gas pedal down as he got closer, avoiding looking at the man. *It could be a coincidence; some guy that looked like the other one, and it was not like his clothes were anything special. On the contrary, they were pretty ordinary.* Except it wasn't. The patches were there, and his face had the same qualities that made him squirm. 

He dared not look as he saw the blur of the man pass in his periphery. He focused on getting the horrible dread out of his mind. His chest tightened as the world went dim around him, his hearing dulling and his eyes shaking. His hands gripped the wheel for support as he forcefully shut his eyes. Taking deep breaths, he steadied himself. Opening his eyes, he saw an alarming scene playing in front of him. A man with an arm pointed towards him, thumbs up, smiling, was in the middle of the road, the lights bleaching out any color from his skin as he barreled towards him. 

Slamming on the brakes, his body snapped forward, and he hit his head on the steering wheel, stars flashing in his vision. The screeching of tires filled his ears as he tried to turn the car to avoid ramming into the man. 

He was sure he had hit the man with how long his RV took to stop. He settled into place, his body falling back into the seat as the car halted completely. His head was down, and his eyes were closed as he collected himself. With bated breath, he opened his eyes, vision swimming slightly, and looked at what gruesome scene would surely lie before him. 

It was him. The man with his arm extended, thumb up, smile on his face.

He was unharmed and stood stalk still. As soon as he laid eyes upon the man, he walked around the side of his RV, going to the back passenger side door. Fumbling to engage the locks, his vision swam as he wiped his head around to the door panel, making it impossible to steady himself to press the small button. 

The car door clicked open.

His entire body completely stilled as the shuffling of clothes and quiet breaths filled the eerie silence. The man shut the door softly, and a click signaled his seatbelt was on. Looking up from where his hand was hovering above the lock button, he stared into the rearview mirror. The hitchhiker's smiling face stared back. 

His hand white-knuckled the steering wheel as he stared into the man's deep black eyes, a soulless orb that let no light in, a true darkness. He slowly turned his head around to look directly at the man. His whole body shook as he looked at the hitchhiker, a smile deceptively wide. His entire persona was just *off.*  His posture made his head sag too low. His body pressed uncomfortably into the seat, with his arms hanging limply by his sides. His neck was too long, and his shoulders were too broad, making his jacket stretch against them. 

His fear turned into panic. He wanted him out of his car. *Now.*

“Get the fuck out of my car!” his voice betrayed him. It shook, revealing his fear. 

The hitchhiker stared back and said with an air of calmness. “This isn't my stop.”

“W-wha? Who the fuck are you?!” His breathing hitched as the man's face dropped, his smile gone, and a visage of calm anger took its place, a deep, unnerving projection of his impatience. He whipped his head back around to the road, making his head spin slightly. That face made him pale, and a deep shaking rocked his body. The air was eerily still, and no noises were coming from either man, like time had stopped, waiting for them to do something.  

The old woman’s warning rang in his head: *You will pick him up.*

*Don't talk to him. Don't look at him. Drop him off when he tells you.*

She was right. 

Some power made this man get into his car. Something unnatural, his subconscious screamed to get as far away as he could. 

*He had fucked up.*

He had to drive him. The rules the old woman told him were real. The man was proof of that. He steeled himself as he put the RV into drive and continued down the road. He didn't want to open himself to the man. He didn't want the man to hear him for fear of revealing something he was scared of. He dared not speak to the man anymore.

As the car's engine awoke, its hum was muffled and distorted. Like a corrupted recording, it stuttered and shook. As the car came up to speed, he looked back into the rearview mirror. The man's fake smile was back, plastered on, wider than any normal smile should be. 

It made him want to crumple in on himself. His breath was quick and shallow, head pounding louder with every passing second. The car churned through the darkness. He pushed the engine to the limit as he floored the gas pedal. 

It wasnt fast enough to escape the dread that filled the cabin. 

The thing made no moves, and with every glance at the mirror, its eyes bored into him. 

He couldn't stop meeting the man's eyes in the rearview. He tried to fight it, but like a trainwreck, he had to watch it. It pulled him in.

He looked at it once again, and this time its face was gone. A nothingness was in its place, a deep pit of darkness that no light could penetrate. His whole body paled as he stared into the void. It was pulling him in like a black hole. Tears forced themselves from his eyes. They ran down his face, and a feeling of total helplessness washed over him. He couldn't look away, and with every moment that passed, he could feel his mind warping, his very being shook.

His eyes would not close. He could not blink. He could not turn away. He *had* to look at it.

He took a shaking hand, feeling around, and found the straw of the empty drink in the cupholder. He picked it up, knowing what he had to do. 

He *had* to look away. 

With his fading willpower, he plunged the straw into his eye. The pain brought him back. Blood and viscera descended his face as his eye tore apart in its socket. His guttural scream filled the silence. He kept screaming as the pain bored into his head. His vocal cords became raw and broken. His rasping breaths were all that was left. 

But he had looked away.

The straw was impaled in him, blood coming out of the end like it was being sucked through. It poured down onto the floor as he hung his head. His remaining vision swam as his stomach heaved. He needed to look back to the road. He needed to keep driving. 

*Pick him up. Don't talk to him. Don't look at him. Drop him off when he tells you.*

His rasping breaths came shorter and quicker as the pain started to get worse, his mind catching up, the initial shock wearing off. He didn't know how he had stayed on the road, but he was still perfectly in his lane, never deviating. 

Time seemed irrelevant as his head swam. The road ahead was straightforward, as it had been for–who knows how long. His breathing was deep and ragged now, tiredness washing over him as his eye throbbed in deep pain. 

A small light down the road caught his attention, a small structure illuminated by a streetlight above it. As he got closer, he saw it was a small bus stop. 

In the middle of nowhere. 

As he drew closer, a voice broke the silence.

“This is my stop.”

\*\*\*

The telltale sound of an engine told her a car had rolled into the station. She read her book, the same one she reads every day. She waits for the door's shrill chime, but it doesn't sound as time passes. 

Looking up from her book, she sees the same RV that left a few hours ago. Taking a deep breath, she readies and walks out into the brisk night. Striding up to the RV, she pulls the door handle, and it opens without pause. The inside is empty, and the engine is still running.

A small pool of blood stained the carpet, droplets splattering the seat. She looks at the scene with indifference and hops into the driver's seat. The keys were still in the ignition; the cabin was warm, and the residual body heat could still be felt on the seat as she settled in.

Forgoing the seatbelt, she put the car in drive and rounded the corner of the gas station, moving it to the parking lot full of cars. Pulling into the closest space, she parked, took the keys out, and locked its doors for the last time. Walking back, her heavy steps echoed throughout the station.

She sighed as he opened the backdoor, tossing the keys into the bucket with the rest of them. The small clink of the keys was muffled by the others filling the bucket. She closed the door, not bothering to lock it. Walking back to the front, she sank back into her tattered chair and picked up her book. Waiting for the doors to chime once again.

I blew into the valve for the water inlet, with a bubble tea straw, no luck :' I tried the ziplock bag method.. Nada! I'm about to give up on this machine, but I wanted one genius idea that could save it.. 

PS: I called a few coffee machine repair shops, but they want to charge me half the price of the machine to repair it!! So unless there are some cheaper options out there, I'm not going to try that route.

Prior to that we argued over scissors this morning. We were opening those small to go cereal boxes to which I opened mine with my hands and he was so desperately looking for the scissors we had in the kitchen. But with the moving process we tend to misplace things, anyways he’s looking for the scissors, opens the kitchen draws looking for the Kitchen Scissors. 
I’ve told him before to not use because they’ll end up getting dull. I tell him “don’t use my kitchen scissors you’re going to dull them” he goes to respond “I’ll get you a glass case for them since you love your little scissors so much” I told him I use those to cut vegetables and any other things I use in the kitchen and here’s the other thing because he’s done it before. He’ll use my kitchen scissors for something like construction paper, boxes and this time he wanted to use them for his plastic bag. 
He’ll then just leave them placed on the counter without cleaning them leaving me to wash them myself. So I go up stairs, get the pair of scissors I told him we had there multiple times and bring it to our kitchen pencil holder and tell him “next time you pick up something put it back where you found it” that starts another argument about how I’m one the who grabbed them, I’m the one who took them up stairs blahblahblah. 
So we end up leaving to get coffee i order my own since normally he’ll order a large for the both of us and my plan was to do that and tell him to drop me off at home while he ran the other errands and I did what needed to be done at home. 
I go to change use the bathroom and here he is in the bathroom peeping in and obviously I’m not in the mood so I tell him to let me be. Afterwards he comes to comfort me wanting a hug and to apologize, im still not in the mood and tell him I need time to myself I’m going to work on the garden. He’s then upset, I can hear it in his voice so I go back to his open arms and stand there. He’s kissing me check to check then lips and I’m still not there. He’s tells me to stop being so emotional and to stop crying to which I respond to him, go do what you have to do I’m working on the front yard I need time to myself right now. He says he doesn’t feel like doing anything anymore to which I reply “well I’m going outside”. 
We’re re talking now and I just made him lunch. So aitah or did I just need to vent? ",0,1765134676.0,AITAH,7,0.25,False

A couple of months ago I left that job to start something of my own, so now my mornings are free and I'm shifting my workouts to early morning.

I don't drink coffee or take caffeine at all. No pre-workouts, no energy drinks, not even tea. The idea of having a morning coffee feels nice for two reasons:

1. it seems like a good lifestyle habit and a social thing,
2. it might give me a small boost for my workouts.

But I'm also thinking... am I just being stupid here? I worry I'll create a dependence I don't really need, and it will become another small daily cost for no real reason.

If you were in my place, would you start? Is the performance boost worth it for someone who has never used caffeine? Or should I skip it and keep things simple?

So, I actually wrote this one before the first part. I was reminded of a few yandere ASMR audios I'd stumbled upon years ago. Like, years and years ago. There was rain, distorted television static, faint notes of some sweet, unfamiliar piece of music, and a positively unhinged psychopath who had kidnapped you and may or may not have killed all your friends and family.

Right.

Well, I'm not comfortable with the last part- this storyline doesn't have any gruesome murders, sorry to disappoint- but I guess I was going for that vintage, difficult-to-describe aesthetic for which I felt this sudden surge of nostalgia. And at its very heart, of course, is her. Chloe.

Hey, baby. I’m home.

Ssshhh. It’s me. Chloe. Your loving girlfriend. I’m....(as if trying out a new word that pleases her) I’m your *girlfriend.*

(A lingering pause)

I’m sorry I had to leave you for a while. I really wanted to be here when you woke up. If I could, then I’d never- *ever-* leave your side. (Whispering) Never let you out of my sight....out of my arms....but I-

(Sighing) I have to work.

(Pouting, muttering softly) Can’t take care of you if I don’t work....and can’t stay with you when I do have to work....being a girl is so difficult sometimes.

Hey. It’s okay, sweetheart. Don’t try to speak. You can’t move most of your muscles. It’s because of that very special, um, *concoction* I gave you earlier. (Giggling lightly)

Don’t look at me all betrayed, babe. I wouldn’t have had to inject it into your arm if you’d have drunk it like a good little darling. But no, you always have to make things difficult.

It didn’t hurt too much, did it? I know you don’t like syringes. I was extra careful, and extra gentle with you. I don’t want my baby to be in discomfort.

(Breathing audibly, intensely, whispering up close) I didn’t hurt you, right?

Babe? Tell me I didn’t hurt you. Can- Can you please blink your eyes twice if you’re not in pain?

(A longer pause)

(Sighing with genuine relief) Thank you. I can tell you’re being honest. Always can, with you. I- I really do appreciate your cooperation, my dear. Despite our new....circumstances....our relationship is still the same as it has always been. Right?

We’re still best friends. Right....?

Babe?

*(SFX: Soft rustling of blankets)*

You know, I’m impressed you managed to find the remote and turn on the telly, in your sluggish, mostly immobilized state. Guess boredom’s your biggest enemy when you’re kidnapped and your owner is gone, huh?

Did I say “owner”?

I’m sorry, honey. I’m not your owner. I’m just your girlfriend. Your very concerned, very worried girlfriend. You know how pets sometimes leave the house when you keep the door unlocked? It’s kinda like that, yeah, though I did make sure to lock every door.

What sort of pet are you? Oh, babe- that was just an analogy! You’re not a pet. You’re my sweet, sweet treasure (pecking his cheek). The light of my life.

I’m sorry for having to....to keep you like this, but I- I just can’t risk it, you know? (Whispering) I can’t lose you so soon, right after I found you again.

You sound so cute when you’re trying to speak. But I can’t really understand you, baby. I’m sorry.

Hm?

Oh, you are *cute!* Yes, you are. But I’m not making the mistake of trusting your words- your rosy promises- not doing that again. I trusted you four years ago, to keep in touch, but you just....

(Sighing) No, no. We don’t have to talk about this. I just want to spend some time with you. *(SFX: More rustling, as she cuddles up to the listener)* I missed you. Been thinking about you for hours, my love. You’re living rent free inside my head at this point. And I don’t like it. (Whispering) Would very much prefer it if you just applied for permanent residence. (Giggling at her own joke)

Mind if I play with your hair?

Awww, you’re just the sweetest ever! Alright, time for some scritches!

*(SFX: ASMR-esque hair brushing)*

(Soft, whimsical, almost sing-song) Scritch....scritch....scritch....pat, pat, pat, and scritch....all the headpats and head scritches in the world for my cute little pet. (Faint giggle)

(Reverie) You’re not a pet. I’m not....not going to collar you, or treat you like you’re under me. (Rambly) Well- you are definitely *under* me since I’m, you know, I’m on top of you right now and all, but like- (Solemn) I don’t think you’re inferior to me. Not at all. I just....feel this *need,* to take care of you, you know?

You’ve been all alone in the world for so long. Fending away the nightmares. Trying to outrun the hounds at your heels. (Whispering) You’re not used to feeling safe, and secure, and cared for. You’re not used to being held close, and feeling loved. And that- that’s not okay. (Pouting) I’m not going to let you feel that way anymore.

I’ll show you you’re not unlovable. Or unworthy. Or unimportant. You....you’re as far away from those things, as the edge of the universe from that window. Can you see the streams and rivulets of rain, sliding down the glass?

My darling, I....I have loved you since the beginning. Because you’re special. (Sighing, whispering) To me.

(A longer pause)

What were you watching, hon? Anything particularly interesting on the news?

(Faintly surprised) Hey....hold on a minute. That’s....

Is that your missing person report?

*(Faint television programme continues, as the seconds trickle by)*

....Huh. The woman on the news channel is saying you were last seen in your house by the neighbours. (Stroking listener’s hair) Did you not tell anyone you were coming to my show?

Oh, sweetie. You’ve always been hard to get a hold of. Always so elusive and mysterious, like a baby unicorn. Or maybe a magical slug, because your movements are kinda sluggish right now. Get it? (Snickering quietly)

Ssshh. It’s okay, hon. I know. (Pecking him, crooning lovingly) I know. You just....you really wanted to see me. And, in your excitement, you forgot to tell anyone about where you would be. I read your chats and socials. (Whispering) I don’t think anyone’s going to start finding any clues about your current *situation.* Not anytime soon. (Kissing the listener possessively)

Oh, would you look at that? The authorities think you’re the latest victim in a- a “recent string of deaths and disappearances”, tied to the....huh, to the “resurgence” of some local mob in the city.

They think I’m some two-bit thug, do they? And all this talk of *criminal* activity- (sighing dramatically) what’s my crime, ‘sides falling in love?

*(SFX: Turning off the television)*

(Pouting) It’s not fair.

I’m sorry, love. Did you say something?

(Matter of fact) *Darling*. I did not “technically” kidnap you. Please. I- I’d hardly call it a kidnapping (laughing breathily). I mean, you’re not a kid. *Boop*. You’re my baby. (Giggling)

*(SFX: Shifting blankets)*

I only hastened what was going to happen anyway. You had it coming. And besides....(low, smooth, silky) you chose to come to my show, did you not?

(Whispering) I wasn’t the only one suffering from the pangs of....of loneliness. All alone. You wanted to see me as well.

Well, you are seeing me now.

Oh, honey. No, I can’t let you go. Naughty, naughty, naughty. Such a mischievous and cunning little thing you are. *Boop.*

If I let you go, where would that leave me? Alone, and neglected, and cold. Again. So....very.....cold.

Hm? I couldn’t quite hear you, my dear. Could you please say that a little louder?

(Waiting patiently)

Oh, babe. (Sighing) No, you can’t skip the special medicine. The one which makes you so relaxed. It’s....it’s necessary, my dear.

Because, (leaning in, whisper-talking) without it, I’d have to tie you to my bed with cuffs. And I don’t wanna do that. Your wrists would chafe, and your arms would get all sore.

I don’t want my baby to be in discomfort. That.....(troubled, almost in pain) that just won’t do. I won’t stand for it.

Darling, please don’t say it like that. I do trust you. Of course I do. Just not with- not with choosing to stay. I do want you to be able to move around, hold me in your arms. Cuddle me. (Swooning, giggling like a teenage girl).

(Sighing, bitter) But my manager says I can’t risk it. She says if I want to keep you, then this....this is just how it’s going to be for now.

Miss Hathaway is clever. When I told her I wanted you- *needed* you- she was doubtful at first. She wouldn’t let me be seen in public with a partner. I guess it’s better for my ratings that way- my fans seem to adore me not just for my music, but also because they think I’m single. And that I could pick any one of them to be my lover.

(Frowning softly) Although, I don’t think many of them would sign up if they could see what being my lover *really* means.

(Raising an eyebrow) Oh? You think most guys would gladly trade places with you right now?

Well, too bad. No one’s going to be trading with you. I want you, and that is non-negotiable. Miss Hathaway is clever, but she’s also really nice. To me. She always gives me what I want, in the end. She’s almost like a mother to me, you know? (Quietly) The mother I never had in my life.

This was her idea. She said I could keep you all to myself, as long as you were my little secret. My little ray of sunshine, tucked away in my bedroom. (Pecking him possessively)

I do trust you, my darling, but I....I just can’t give you a chance to run away. I’m sorry.

The medicine’s effects only last for about 12 hours. Please open your mouth. It’s time for another little dose.

(Firmly) No, pet. You’re not wiggling your way out of this one. Don’t try to take advantage of my affections for you. Open your mouth.

I can always get the syringe if you’d prefer that.

Mhmn. Thought so. Hold on to this pill. Don’t swallow. I’ll get you some water.

*(SFX: Pouring water into a glass)*

There we go. I’ll hold it to your lips so you can drink.

(Soft, soothing, full of affection) There we are. Good boy. So good for me. Drink as much as you want. You must have been thirsty. The decanter on your nightstand is mostly full. I know you have just enough slack to reach for it, but you didn’t drink much at all. Were you asleep all day?

I’m sorry I left you alone for so long. I’m currently on tour, so most of my days are packed full. Today was my last concert in this city. I won’t be returning until, like, next year I guess. We’ll be travelling soon. The next leg of the tour will kick off several hundred miles away.

Anyway, I’m taking tomorrow off so I can spend the whole day with you. (Suggestive, sultry) We have so much catching up to do, babe. Trust me, you’ll be glad for *any* reprieve you get due to the meds.

*(SFX: Playing with his hair)*

And the day after tomorrow, we’ll be travelling. We’ll have to pretend you’re part of my staff- maybe a sound design tech or something- in case anybody asks. And I- I’ll have to keep you under wraps most of the time. (Frowning) I don’t like it. I’d much rather show you off to the world. Make them know we’re together. But that....(cryptically) hmmnn, maybe someday in the future. (Whispering) If things go according to plan.

I think Miss Hathaway’s been left quite jaded by men over the years, you know?She’s um, she’s used to men disappointing her. Running away from her. I think she’s just looking out for me, in her own way. (Caressing listener’s cheek, whispering) She doesn’t want me to go through the pain, of losing the person I love.

This is for the best, my darling. I’m not going to lose you. I already spent four years without you. (Muttering quietly) Not going to let you out in the world again.

(Whispering, fanatically) I’m not going to lose you. I’m not, I’m not, I’m not!

You’re not my captive. You- you’re not some kind of possession. (Lost in thought) The prettiest, most precious jewel in my drawer. (Reassuring again) Of course not. You’re my soulmate. My....(smiling faintly) my dreamer boy, my sanctuary. But even then....if you had to- to pretend, that you were my possession, my little secret....only for my eyes to see, my fingers to caress, my lips to kiss....(kissing him, speaking ever so softly, fervently) then would I not be worth it?

(Whispering) You’re still in love with me, aren’t you?

*(Lingering silence and rainfall)*

Wrap your arms around me.

I know you can do it, my little slug. I’m just going to lie on top of you like this, tuck my head under your chin. Press my ear right up against your heart, which seems to be quickening ever so slowly. And I’m going to wait for you.

Hold me in your arms. Please.

(A longer pause)

Baby?

(Pouting, muttering softly) You managed to reach for the TV remote just fine.

(Another pause)

(Sighing happily) Thank you, my sweet. You really are the sweetest. I....(serious, steadfast) I love you, okay?

Yes. Deal with it. In fact, I love you so much, I give you full permission. You can hold me as tightly as you want, hold me *wherever* you want. You can play with my hair, and stroke my back as if I were a cat girl in one of your comics. Meow. (Laughing a bit) And you can kiss me all you want, and you can- oh, you can basically have your way with me. Yeah.

(Coyly, mischievously) It’s just a shame you can’t move around all that much, because of the medicine. Your arms feel so heavy, so relaxed. Your whole body does. Every bit of movement seems to take so much effort, doesn’t it? (Sighing dramatically) Here I am, happily giving you permission to do whatever you like with me, and all you can do is cuddle me and sniff the lavender shampoo in my hair. (Whispering) I think it’s quite the tease.

*(Brushing his hair again)*

You know, I checked the weather forecast earlier. It’s going to rain for most of tomorrow. More reason to spend the day in.

Mmnnn, keep holding me. Just like that. This....this is just perfect.

(Soft, slow breathing. No dialogue for a few seconds.)

Hey. Pet.

Dream of me, alright? (Soft, musical laughter)

•	What are the biggest hidden costs or mistakes people make in this category?
•	Any tips on sourcing good instant materials without getting ripped off?
•	How important is branding/packaging vs. taste vs. price in this segment?

There's some good history in the article and It's nice to see the author land some solid burns in the process:

>Responding to Sultana’s suggestion that the working class should govern society, **\[Owen\] Jones** was unnerved. His thoughts turned to those things most dear to him, with visions of his local coffee shop being seized by workers’ councils....

>**Corbyn**’s manifestos pledged to “make Britain a better place to do business”, invoked immigration quotas, and committed to NATO spending targets and retention of the Trident nuclear weapons programme.""...

>The working class, which came forward last century in their millions to put an end to the capitalist order, were betrayed by social democracy and Stalinism. For **\[Tariq\] Ali**, a lifelong anti-Trotskyist, this history is anathema. He now “groans” at the mere mention of nationalisation, and why wouldn’t he? Ali sold his six-bedroom mansion in north London’s Highgate a decade ago for shy of £5 million and is the embodiment of today’s affluent pseudo-left....  
  
Demanding that Sultana “put away childish things”, **\[George\] Galloway** speaks as a lifetime member of Britain’s Labour and Stalinist milieu, and as the leading proponent of “left-right” unity. Galloway allied with Nigel Farage and the Tory Party right-wing during the Brexit referendum and subsequently courted an electoral agreement with Farage’s Brexit Party, the immediate precursor to Reform UK.

1pgqh5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pgqh5l/of_after/,Of After,"I think we’d have fared better if we’d never come back from that way gone side of the coin. Some people got lucky, mostly those in planes; that one group of lottery winners on the space shuttle most certainly. I hadn’t even been awake, sleeping half naked on the coffee table after a belligerent night of shots and pot. Two of my teeth had been cracked by some apoplectic drunk, and the distinct absence of that pain juxtaposed by its violent return had startled me awake just after coming back to life.



December 25, 2028, all members of the human race died for 7 minutes and 41 seconds. For 7 minutes and 41 seconds, each member of the human race joined the choir in Heaven or the gulag of Hell. Some stayed there, their cars burned out with their corpses inside; planes fell like rain, keeping a combined 40 million people, if you count what the planes hit, dead. 20 some planes managed to return in time to secure the controls, but as of now- 50 days later- only 1 person from such flights is still alive. 



If you’d had statistics of our present a decade ago, you’d be lead to believe some disaster hither-to mad max must’ve occurred to motivate 2.3 billion people to commit harmonized suicide; a desperate plea to escape the condition of the new world. True, it was a new world and quite a wicked one in contrast to the golden streets and flitting pearl gates, and true people were escaping it- so in principle I suppose you’d be right, apart from the Mel Gibson or Skull-Mincer of a diesel punk disaster.



Zealots called this an act of God, scientists claimed a sudden flip in the poles of Earth’s magnetic field inverted the flow of neuron firings in our brains, dislodging our consciousnesses and plunging us into a wild hallucination which- paired with mass hysteria- was unified in image; that we hadn’t died but merely taken a magnetic, hypnagogic sleep. 



Neither was convincing to me. I was of the few who claimed this was nothing but the tangential effect of some ineffable anomaly of cosmic grandeur whose non-Euclidean essence grazed our rock and never looked back. Why so specific? Because some of us who died didn’t go up or down. Some of us wandered a dead world. Some of us saw, for but fleeting seconds, that the Sun had a wander standing up to it, silhouetted by the radiance. Some of us think we can join it. Some of us will take as with us as we can.

1pgqewv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pgqewv/aitah_for_condemning_my_coworker_during_a_rush/,AITAH for condemning my co-worker during a rush?,"I (19F) work at a local coffee shop. I've been working there a little over a year, but besides my manager I have been working there the longest out of everyone at the location I work at. A couple months ago, they hired a bunch of new people, but my location only got 3 new people. One of them is Poppy (17F), she is a senior in highschool who has been working with us for 4 months. Poppy is very nice on the surface, however she is not a good barista, and does not have a professional bone in her body. She likes to yell at things that frustrate her, and that is most things. She also will yell at her friends that come in the shop, and threaten them. This would be one thing if she did this when the shop is empty, but she does this when the shop is full of people, and we know she drives customers away because we have had regulars come in and tell us they will not come in if Poppy is working. A lot of my coworkers hate Poppy, but I didn't because I understood what it was like to be the new person who didn't immediately remember all the recipes, wasn't the best at steaming milk, etc.

With that backstory out of the way let's get to what happened. I recently covered a parade shift for my coworker. In small towns, people really show out for most parades, especially the Christmas one. The only people working were me and Poppy, and for the first hour it was dead. Our boss had texted Poppy telling her to deep clean the fridge, and I learned later that it was in her shift notes to deep clean when it was dead. She tried to convince me to do it, saying that she ""doesn't know how to deep clean"" and said that our boss probably wants me to clean since I'm more experienced. I told her that I think she should clean since I'm the more experienced one, so that if someone comes in I can make their order. She pouted about it, and kept asking me how to clean it. I told her how and in the end even helped her by washing containers that were in the fridge as I did feel bad for making her do it by herself. My manager later told me she did an awful job and the only part thing she did right was the dishes.

Then from 5-7 we were absolutely slammed. We had a line out the door that entire time, and all of the customers were freezing from the cold so they all wanted hot lattes, which take the longest to make. Poppy had immediately started taking orders and I started making all the drinks, by myself. This was fine for like 5 minutes before their were 10 cups (for context when we take an order we write what the drink is on the cup) all in a huge pile, so I had no idea which drinks I was supposed to make first. I asked Poppy who's drink was first, and she turned around and just tried to tell me. I told her that she needed to put the cups in a line, and that since she's not helping me she needs to prep them. (Preping is when you put the flavors in the cup, so that the only thing you need to do is put the espresso shot in and the milk). She just said okay and went back to taking more orders, so I prepped those cups that were already there. About 30 minutes later, this guy ordered food and Poppy did not tell me. We were so behind that between this guy ordering to when he got his drinks, it was about a 15 minute wait. This doesn't sound like a long time, but our average wait time is 5 minutes. This man also shouldn't have had to wait that long as he only got a bagel with cream cheese. As I give him his drinks, he said he had food as well. I just stood there for a second, asked him what he got, and then took a deep breath. This is where I might be the asshole. I turn to Poppy infont of everyone and go ""Poppy there's food?"" Which doesn't sound bad, but I was really pissed off so there was a tone to it. I did not yell, as I am not a yeller, that is important for later. She, still taking another order, said ""yeah just give me a second-"" I interrupted her and said ""after you finish this order stop taking them until we catch up. We are drowning because I'm the only one making anything, and all your doing is taking orders. Go make the food"" she didn't say anything to me and did it.

When the last person left the shop I closed the door behind them and locked it, as we were supposed to close 30 minutes earlier. I asked Poppy if she wanted to do the dishes or clean the shop. This felt even to me as none of the dishes were done at all that day, so the sink was literally full. Even if it wasn't, she picked to clean the shop. That was fine with me so I went and did the dishes. Before I finished the dishes, I told Poppy since we were the first ones to be there in the morning, she could put the trash in the back of the shop and we'll take it out in the morning since it's dark out. She just said ""okay"" When I went out back to the shop I noticed that she had not wiped down the counters, bagged the trash, or properly cleaned the espresso machine as there was so many grounds in they tray that you could barely see that it was a silver tray. I thought that she might have misunderstood me about the trash, but I had said to her ""Poppy this tray is filthy man"" and she just cut me a look. I said ""I guess I'll clean it"" and I did. I also bagged the trash and put it in the back for the morning then I left.

I was going to let this go as everyone has bad shifts, and that was Poppy's first real rush. However, when we came in the next morning she barely talked to me. She just sat there on her phone. This is very strange for her as she is very talkative, even when you don't want to talk. I had mentioned the trash to her, as it was still sitting back there. She just looked at me. The person who came in to close that day was my manager, so before I left I took the trash out so my manager wouldn't have to do it, since it was clear Poppy wasn't going to. 
A couple hours after my shift ended I got a text from my manager telling me I needed to come into the shop because she had something to tell me. Something to note is that my manager and I were friends before her promotion, and we still remain great friends. I came in and she told me that Poppy was talking shit about me. Saying that I yelled at her in front of everyone, and the reason we were behind is because I went to the bathroom for 10 minutes in the middle of the rush. I did go to the bathroom during the rush because I couldn't hold it, however it was not 10 minutes because the same song that played when I left was still playing when I came back. Also I asked her to cover for me while I went to the bathroom, so if I was gone for 10 minutes then she should be the one in trouble as when I got back she hadn't even finished one of the 7 drinks on the table. She also said that I didn't do anything to help with the close, just dishes. And that I didn't want to take the trash out. This made me livid as I was literally telling my roommate that I wasn't going to hold that experience against her, and her she is talking shit about me to everyone. I know the only coworkers I care about believe me, and I also went to the owners about this so that if Poppy tried to tell them any of that, they would have my side of the story. I didn't think that I was the asshole, but a couple of my coworkers say that even if I didn't yell at her I shouldn't have gotten onto her like she was a kid in front of the customers, as that's rude.

Ever since Lance broke down the science of laminar vs turbulent flow, I've been chasing that clean, controlled extraction. Built a free tool to help nail it every time.

**Lance Hedrick's V60 Recipe with Timer**

https://preview.redd.it/edg37mqhwt5g1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=5983951485bdef8c1c59b7b6d991622e4f6ac4f6

The timer auto-calculates everything based on your dose:

* Bloom (3× coffee weight) - pour at 6-8 g/s
* 0:40 check - is your bed dry and cracked? Tool reminds you to add a second mini-bloom (20-35g)
* Main pour - single laminar flow pour, maintaining that 6-8 g/s flow rate
* Swirl and drawdown - target 2:30-3:00 total

The whole philosophy here is fewer interventions, more intention. No pulse pouring chaos - just one controlled pour that lets the coffee extract evenly.

But I kept building...



**Extraction Compass**

https://preview.redd.it/8wk3gwtjwt5g1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=4016828a589520e8e4e044bffa7ed6d92a7d402f

This is where it gets nerdy. Click where your brew lands on a grid:

* Sour ↔ Bitter (x-axis)
* Weak ↔ Strong (y-axis)

https://preview.redd.it/2ff0mpymwt5g1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a88ac84515c5ccc8d2403e50a5ec8cc1a0976d6

Get specific adjustments based on what you're brewing. A washed Ethiopian at light roast gets completely different advice than a natural Brazilian at medium. The tool factors in:

* Origin characteristics
* Processing method
* Roast level
* Your current parameters

Because ""just grind finer"" isn't always the answer.  


**Interactive WCR Flavor Wheel**

https://preview.redd.it/3wqrx2cowt5g1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcaa92abf34eca2666f5119245f95cce5ab8afc1

Based on World Coffee Research Sensory Lexicon 2.0. This isn't just a pretty wheel - click any flavor and it tells you:

* The chemistry - why does this coffee taste like jasmine? (hint: linalool)
* Origins that typically express this flavor
* Processing methods that produce it
* Varieties to look for
* Defect check - is this flavor intentional or a sign something went wrong?

It's basically a reverse-lookup for ""I want my coffee to taste like X, what should I buy?""

* 30+ origins - flavor profiles, altitude info, harvest seasons
* 60+ varieties - Gesha, SL-28, Eugenioides, Pink Bourbon, and everything in between
* 20+ processing methods - from classic washed to experimental carbonic maceration and anaerobic fermentation
* Roast level guide - including recommended rest times (light roasts need 2-4 weeks, fight me)

I recently went to Korea and origanally he said he didn't have time to meet but then I attended a marothon to support him and he asked if I will be coming or going straight back to my friend.

When I got into the taxi I turned toward the window and he waved happily goodbye and stayed until the taxi left.

It takes me about 15 minutes total—during my morning coffee, on my lunch break, and while waiting for dinner to cook.

Here’s the magic: consistency is KEY. The app seems to reward active users with better, higher-paying surveys over time. By sticking to my rule, I went from earning maybe $5 a week to a steady **$35-40 a month**. The trick is to just show up daily. The surveys start coming to *you*.

**Pro Tip:** Start with a referral link (like mine: [**https://attapoll.app/join/vtfql**](https://attapoll.app/join/vtfql)). It gives you a small bonus that gets you to your first cashout faster, which is super motivating to stick with the habit. Seriously, try the 'Three a Day' rule for two weeks.

I hope you’re having a cozy, calm, or at least slightly sweet kind of day. I’m reaching out with an open heart, looking for a cuddle buddy and maybe a new friend here in the Netherlands. ideally near Amsterdam or within 30 mins commuting!

A little about me:

• I'm 35 years old guy working as an executive and happily calling Amsterdam home for over 3 years now.
• I live alone, take care of myself, and try to stay fit, but also never say no to dessert.
• I’d be happy to host or come to you, whatever makes you feel safe and comfortable.
• I love being outside, especially in the summer… picnics, strolls, a lazy lunch on a sunny terrace… simple things, really.
• Traveling is a big part of my life and dream. I’d love to see the whole world, one new place (and snack) at a time.
• I’m a good listener. My friends often say I make them feel calm and heard. You’ll get lots of warm, respectful hugs and cozy company if that’s what you need 🤗
• Cleanliness and kindness go hand in hand for me. I value both deeply.
• I'm 183 cm tall, 80 kg, have broad shoulders, little muscular, tanned skin, black hair, brown eyes.

What I’m looking for:

Someone to share gentle and genuine connection with. Whether that’s cuddling up on the couch, sharing a quiet moment over coffee, or just chatting about our days.

I’m also open to making new friends… movie nights, cooking together, mini-adventures nearby… whatever brings joy without pressure.

And of course, if you’d prefer to meet in a public space first, that’s absolutely fine. Your comfort always comes first.

So if you’re someone who values kindness, closeness, and maybe the occasional silly laugh. I’d really love to hear from you. 💛

Let’s make a little space in this busy world for warmth and connection.

Someone warm, genuine, and open to seeing where things go. Ideally, our connection becomes a relationship, because that’s ultimately what I’m looking for.

I can host, drive, or pick you up if you’re comfortable with that. I’d love to chat on here first, and if we vibe, meet for a coffee, dinner or even a fun little pool date.

A bit about me: I recently opened a business, and between that and school I’m pretty driven and stay busy but would absolutely make time for the right person. I’ve also got a new dog I’m training myself but when I do get a free moment I enjoy gaming, building/crafting/working with my hands, playing piano, writing music, cooking, plants and gardening. In warmer weather I skateboard and play tennis, and this winter I’m hoping to finally try snowboarding. As of recent I’ve quit smoking weed and have no intentions of going back but wouldn’t mind some good conversation over a few drinks.

You: 21+ who’s in or near Vaughan/GTA. You communicate well, enjoy good conversation, appreciate honesty, and don’t mind some playful banter. You’re comfortable with closeness and affection that isn’t overly sexual in the beginning, and you like the idea of letting things build naturally. I’m open to any race or body type as I care far more about your personality, and the energy you bring than any specific look or shape. Bonus points if you enjoy dogs, cozy nights, laughter, or just having someone steady and supportive around.

What I’m like: I want something that flows naturally. The kind of connection where effort feels effortless. I’m the type of guy who checks in, listens attentively, and makes you laugh until your stomach feels like you just finished an ab workout. I’m honest. Sometimes brutally so.. because I’d rather tell the truth and deal with a moment of discomfort than lie and deal with the mess that comes after. Transparency and communication are very important to me.

I’m patient, emotionally intelligent, and financially independent. I value constructive criticism and have thick skin.  I enjoy banter, especially when the teasing builds on itself and becomes something original to us.

As for affection: I like to pamper and be pampered. Like hair play, head and back scratches, cuddles, kissing, making out — nothing overly sexual in the beginning. I just enjoy closeness, comfort, and warmth.

I’ve got a lot of affection and care to give, and I’m hoping to find someone who’s looking for the same.",1,1765133378.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,1.0,False

1pgq0v4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1pgq0v4/im_so_damn_done/,I'm so damn done.,"I can't do this shit anymore. I'm so, so tired. 

I'm a married father of 3. I'm out of the house for work for 50ish hours a week, closer to 60 when you factor in travel. 

Let me preface this by saying I've done all the things you're all gonna tell me to do. I've had the chats with the wife. I already do almost everything around the house. 

I work, she doesn't. All of our kids are at school, and she still hasn't got a job. If she was keeping the house in order, I probably wouldn't be as bothered. But. She doesn't do a damn thing. 

My routine for the last 6 months, give or take, has been the following: 

Wake up at 5.
Get dressed, grab coffee. Usual morning crap. 
Head to work. 
Get home around 7 or 8. 
Cook dinner for myself, they've usually eaten. 
Wash up everyone's dinner things, plus pots and pans from the day. 
Tidy the lounge, toys away, hoover etc. 
Sit in tired silence, usually fall asleep. 
Shower, then bed. 

Rinse and repeat. All she does is the school run, and maybe a bit of tidying during the day. 

I've asked her if she's okay. I've asked her if her medication is still working (we're both on sertraline for depression, her 25mg, me 250mg). I've told her I need her to start helping out more. She ignores me for most of the time. She hasn't touched me in months. Not even a cuddle. And I honestly don't know what to do anymore! 

It seems obvious. If t was my best mate, id tell him to leave. But, I have nothing. No one. Every penny I earn goes into running the house. I can't leave my kids, and I feel trapped. 

My depression is the worst it's ever been. I fling wildly between wanting to end it all, to feeling nothing at all, to wanting to rip my own face off because I'm too much of a fucking coward to do anything about anything. 

Fuck I hate myself. 

Anyway, thanks for coming to my TED talk. I don't really know what to take from anybody this, I guess I just needed to write it down or something. ",19,1765133265.0,Vent,18,0.92,False
1pgq0me,https://i.redd.it/qrzngl9evt5g1.jpeg,The Flesh of Mr. Jackknife,"Beth pushes open the rusted metal doors of the warehouse and steps inside. Dark bruises cover her face and arms. She nervously hugs a dead flashlight to her chest. She walks down the corridor, stepping over shadowy shapes as she presses forward.

The door on the opposite end of the corridor flings open, allowing the dim fluorescent bulbs of the next room to provide light to the decrepit corridor. Beth notices the shapes she has been stepping over are bodies, brutalized and sliced into pieces. Another shape can be seen pushing itself through the doorway. At first it’s vaguely the shape of a man, but as it moves forward its silhouette betrays the guise of humanity. It’s soft and wet and undulates as it moves. Beth screams.

To a cameraman, it was a great shot. To some young theater goers, hiding their eyes in fear, it would be perfect. To Clark Harris, it would need a reshoot.

“CUT!”

I stopped the camera, and wiped the sweat from my brow. The heat in the warehouse was oppressive, and stepping out into the cool autumn air brought instant relief. I lit up a cigarette and watched the treeline surrounding the warehouse. I held the smoke in and allowed it to dance in my lungs.

I was deep in thought when the warehouse’s back door swung open, making me jump. I cleared my throat and shifted my weight back and forth anxiously. Michelle, with an air of attitude in her movements, sat on the steps just outside of the door. Her curly blonde hair was disheveled and covered with fake dirt and her skin was covered with cosmetic bruises and wounds. 

I turned around and tried to avoid acknowledging the awkward silence occurring between us. She was much younger than me. I couldn’t think of any common ground between us, no small talk ideas came to mind. 

A few moments passed and I turned around again to face her. Her blue eyes pierced into mine. She cradled her head in her hands and had a frustrated look on her face. Wordlessly, I pulled a smoke from the pack and held it out to her. She took it, and placed it in her mouth. She continued staring at me. I had never felt so intimidated by someone half my size. Then the realization hit me like a bag of bricks. 

“Shit, yeah… sorry,” I said, holding my lighter out to her, flame flickering in the autumn breeze.

***

“What do you think of that thing, man? Freaky, right?” Clark was beaming with energy, his eyes darting back and forth between me and the latex nightmare before me. “Here he is, our Mr. Jackknife,” he said excitedly, as if I might have missed it.

“Man, the detail is unreal. We should get some close ups,” I replied, my mind swimming with ideas. I would be lying if I said I fully understood Clark’s vision from the get go, but seeing our monster standing in front of us made this whole project feel more real.

It looked like a man wearing a long trench coat, standing a little over 7 feet tall. Long gangly arms hung at its sides, with rods connected to the wrists and elbows for the puppeteers to control them. Inside the trench coat was a glistening mass of fake flesh and slime. Gleaming blades of all different shapes and sizes protruded from all angles of the pile of gore. A fedora topped the head of the monstrosity, and a twisted, fleshy visage lay underneath it.

“Did a bang up job didn’t he?” Clark jabbed a thumb in the direction of a man who was hunched over mixing a bowl of slime with a paintbrush. He looked up from his work. I smiled and raised a hand in greeting.

“Nice to meet you. I assume you are Robert, I have heard a lot about you.” The man said. “I’m Steven, I have been working with puppetry and effects for many years. I have constructed a team of very talented individuals. Your project is in the right hands.”

“You can call me Rob if you’d like,” I replied. “I do the camera work. We filmed a short scene with your team last night, though I didn’t get to see him in the light.” I gestured towards Mr. Jackknife.

“He’s truly wonderful, isn’t he?” Steven mused. “My greatest creation yet.”

Once the puppet had been properly caked in slime, we could begin the filming. It was an outdoor scene, making the heat of the warehouse a distant memory. The scene would require Michelle to have a fight with Mr. Jackknife. It had all the makings of a fun shoot, and I was excited. We had choreographed the whole thing, and had practiced a bit with the puppet without the cameras rolling. Steven hadn’t lied, his team was immensely talented. The flesh under the monster’s coat seemed to ripple and breathe with each movement.

I began setting up the camera, dialing in the angle for the shot. I was peering through the viewfinder when a tap on my shoulder caused me to jump. It was Michelle, with a wide grin on her face, and an outstretched hand. She really had a knack for scaring me. When I realized what she was asking for, I started to laugh.

“You some kind of charity case now?” I asked, digging in my pocket for the box of smokes.

“C’mon, I need something to chill me out.” she replied, accepting the cigarette and lighter. “I’m probably gonna have to film this scene a hundred times.”

“Clark is a particular guy, I’m surprised he doesn’t come over here and get behind the camera,” I chuckled. “How did you end up on this project anyway?”

“I’m a barista at a coffee shop nearby. Clark came in and asked me if I wanted to get paid to be in a movie. I asked him if it was *that* kind of movie, and he said no.”

I thought about what a fool Clark was and laughed even harder. “No shit, and you said yes?”

“Mama always said I had a face for the pictures.” Michelle said with a shrug. I could barely believe what I was hearing. Michelle did great work, I thought for sure she was some actress Clark had found with a casting call. Before I could say anything else, she was bounding off to the set, and I went back to my camera.

The filming night dragged on, I listened to Clark shout out his revisions while the increasingly tired Michelle continued perfecting the scene. The puppeteers slid Mr. Jackknife across the floor, resetting him back to his starting position. I realized as I watched through the viewfinder that I had never spoken to either of them, even though they seemed to accompany Steven everywhere. They were constantly hooded and wearing all black, which made sense during filming, but not in between scenes.

I aimed the camera and zoomed in, attempting to spot the face of the puppeteer controlling Mr. Jackknife's arms. The camera slowly zoomed in and for a fleeting second I captured a motion blurred look at the puppeteer. He was extremely pale, his ghost white skin highly contrasting his black attire. He had sharp angular features, and had no visible eyebrows. I heard Clark yelling for the shoot to begin again, and I readied the camera.

Beth runs down a dark and damp alleyway before a brick wall blocks her path. She’s panting and begins to scramble for a way out. Behind her, a shape is closing in. It walks with slow and heavy footsteps and its body sways side to side. The shape stops in front of Beth, now illuminated by the lights nearby. Beth sees the face underneath the hulking monster’s hat and begins to panic. His hand pulls back a side of the trench coat and reveals a squirming mass of flesh and jagged blades. He reaches for the hilt of a knife that protrudes from his chest. With a sickening sound, the knife slowly exits the flesh, blood and bile eject from the now open hole. The knife, covered in viscera, rises above the creature’s head. Then the massive body of the beast collapses forward, crashing on top of Beth and onto the ground.

“CUT!” Clark says, flying out of his director's chair. “The fuck just happened?”

I shared in Clark’s confusion. That was not the way we had been rehearsing the scene for the past several hours. Beth was supposed to yank a blade of her own from Mr. Jackknife’s body, and start stabbing the puppet. Clark shoved the puppeteers out of the way and lifted the puppet from the ground. By this time I was already running over to them as well. When I finally reached the pair my heart sank.

Beth laid on the ground covered in fake blood and slime, but among the sea of bright red was a deep, darker crimson. Michelle had a large gash in her forehead, and blood poured down the left side of her face. 

“What the fuck man?!” I found myself shouting. “She’s hurt, man. We need to get her to a hospital now!” I tore off my overshirt and Clark used it to compress the wound. I looked around me and noticed Steven and his team were nowhere to be found. Marching off set, I spotted one of the puppeteers in his black clothing, standing still with his back towards me.

“Hey man, you need to tell me what just happened, that was not how that was supposed to go!” I couldn't hide my anger, and when I got no response, not even a turn in my direction, my anger bubbled over. 

“I’m talking to you, asshole!” I say, my palm landing hard on the puppeteer's shoulder and spinning him around. It was the pale man that I had spotted in the viewfinder. His eyes were unfocused, not looking in any particular direction. His mouth was partially open, like a cartoon character under hypnosis.

“Did he get the blood?” His words were slurred like a drunk man’s.

“What?”

“The blood, he smelled like flesh.”

The man’s eyes focused on mine while I stared at him in confusion. Then he walked past me, allowing his shoulder to collide with mine as he walked forward, almost robotically. Clark and Steven seemed to be in the middle of a frantic conversation, while the second puppeteer stood nearby.

“This was due to a mistake by my team, and I intend to make it right to the best of my ability,” Steven was saying as I approached. He helped the injured Michelle to her feet and they began to head to Steven’s station wagon. I felt strange about the situation, but if Michelle was getting medical attention then I figured it was for the best.

“Steven said he’s gonna take care of everything, Rob. He’s taking Michelle to the hospital. He said they used real blades in the puppet because it showed up better on camera, they never expected an accident like that to happen,” Clark explained, as if he was trying to convince himself more than me. 

I could feel my heart thumping in my ears, the adrenaline of the situation was wearing off and the panic was starting to set in. “Clark, man, this is all fucked! What if Michelle is really hurt, man? She's just some random girl you pulled off of the street.” My mind was spinning in circles. So many worst case scenarios were running through my head. What if we got sued? My mind selfishly wondered how Clark and I would deal with the repercussions of what had happened. Clark interrupted my manic pacing by grabbing my shoulders.

“Chill out Rob, chill!” He said, staring me in the eyes. I couldn’t return his gaze, my eyes were on my shoes. “Listen buddy, this has been our dream since school, remember? Nobody ever said it would be easy. This is what we always wanted man, think about it! Theatres full of scared kids watching our movie! Kids dressing up as Mr. Jackknife for Halloween! This is what we always wanted to do!” 

After a few minutes and some deep breaths I was more grounded than before. My mind went back to the strange way the puppeteer was acting. When I explained to Clark what happened, he said something that was even stranger.

“Yeah one of them was listening in on Steven and I when we were figuring out what to do with Michelle. Weird looking guy, super pale and totally hairless.”

How was that possible? The man that I had been talking to had the exact same appearance. Was I overthinking this? I had a massive pit in my stomach that I couldn’t ignore. 

Clark, unable to read the room, chose this time to tell me that we weren’t actually allowed to be filming in this alleyway. Apparently he hadn’t bothered to go through the proper channels to secure permission. We set to cleaning up the set and getting all of our equipment back in storage before deciding our next move. In the frantic mess that was the night's events I had failed to notice that Mr. Jackknife was nowhere to be found.

“Hey Clark, did Steven take the puppet with him?”

“I don’t know why he would, can you not find it?”

As Clark walked over I noticed the slimy, muddy footprints leading out of the alleyway out into the street. Logically it must have been from a crew member that had stepped in some slime while working on set. But why were the shoe prints so large?

Before we knew it, we were driving. We abandoned all of the film equipment and left. Something had felt wrong to both of us, and we decided that if there was a chance we could help, we should try. I looked out the window solemnly. Clark was right, it had always been a dream of ours to make a movie together. But the budget had grown out of control, the endless reshoots, and now our lead actress was hurt. With every passing moment the dream felt just a little bit further away. 

A few minutes passed and my thoughts were interrupted by the sounds of squealing tires as we lurched to a stop. A massive object slammed into the windshield and fell to the ground in front of the car. I couldn’t believe my eyes, Mr. Jackknife was laying face down in a heap in the middle of the road. Blood and slime was splattered everywhere.

We sat in silence, failing to understand what was happening. The car’s windshield was cracked and a side mirror dangled from its wires.  Mr. Jackknife slowly stood up, using his awkwardly long arms to pull himself up the road’s guard rail. He began walking again, his legs buckling and shaking like a newborn deer. Without so much as turning around, he continued walking the way he was heading. 

Our pursuit of the puppet was slow going, the car crawling behind him as he took each shaky step forward. Eventually, Mr. Jackknife took a hard turn off of the road, down a long gravel driveway, and towards a large industrial building. It looked like it was long abandoned, with overgrown vegetation and boards across the windows. 

Clark stopped the car and turned the headlights off. We waited under the cover of darkness to see what would happen. As the puppet approached the door, several puppeteers burst out and began to drag Mr. Jackknife through the threshold. 

There were at least ten of them. They all looked identical to the two that worked on our set. They worked quickly, piloting Mr. Jackknife through the door and out of sight.

“Shit, they probably have Michelle in there, should we find a phone and call someone?” Clark didn’t take his eyes off of the door as he spoke. Glancing up at the rearview mirror, he froze. 

Looking behind me, there were several puppeteers hiding in the woods behind us, their eyes glowing like a cat's in the moonlight. We had slowly crawled up the driveway and hadn’t realized how far we had come. Suddenly a shadow appeared next to the driver’s side window. A puppeteer had silently moved right next to us, and I watched as the other pairs of eyes in the distance drew closer. 

The puppeteer by the window wound up a punch and swung wildly at the window. As soon as its fist made contact, it exploded into a shower of blood. It appeared to have no bones, just skin, flesh and blood. I whipped around as another slammed its head into my window, causing it to crack. When it pulled its head from the window it had a gaping crater where the top half of its face used to be.

Soon, dozens of them had set upon the car. The roof was filled with dents as blood poured down the windows from above. They kicked the windows until their feet fell off and they were kicking with nothing but stumps. It didn’t take long for them to break the windows and reach in. The broken glass shredded their limbs into ribbons, but they didn’t stop grabbing. I kicked the car door open hard, caving in the chest of a puppeteer. I tried to make a run for it but was tackled to the ground. One of the horrible clones started to beat me, its fingers breaking off against my chest. I reached out in self defense and its face pulled off in one swift motion. I was able to escape the now eyeless creature as it felt around blindly in the grass.

As I ran I turned back to see the car completely covered in viscera and thrashing bodies. Clark was still inside somewhere. If I turned back now, I would be overrun by the puppeteers and killed. They were fragile enough to deal with alone, but if I was overrun by multiple of them I would have no chance of survival. I reached the door Mr. Jackknife had gone through and tugged at the handle. It was locked. My attempts to be quiet were foiled by crunching leaves as I circled the building's perimeter.

I reached a window and began tugging at the boards covering it. The first board released, clattering to the ground. I quickly checked behind myself to find the puppeteers were still busy with the car. The next board came loose. I turned around again. This time all of the puppeteers stood completely still, their broken bodies still dripping with blood. I heard footsteps behind me as I pulled the last board off with a tug and leapt through the window frame.

The room inside descended much further underground than I anticipated, and I tumbled down and crashed through a large cot. Pain shot through my shoulder as I stood up. The now broken cot looked like one from a hospital. As I squinted in the darkness I noticed several other identical beds scattered around the room. I slowly crept through the room, noticing that there were several unmoving puppeteers laid in some of the beds. Some of them were connected to IV drips that were filled with blood. Some of them moved their limbs or thrashed their heads back and forth. Others simply followed me with their eyes as I passed by. 

The door at the end of the room I was heading to swung open, causing me to take cover underneath a cot. In the darkness I recognized Steven. He was wearing a blood stained white coat over his button up and khaki pants. He started inspecting the cot that I had broken and noticed that the window above was no longer boarded. A flashlight clicked on and he began to search the room, the light stopping to inspect each bed. As I watched, I tried to decide my course of action. I could try to disable Steven, but if the puppets woke up I would be overrun. I resolved to try to find Michelle before anything found me. I pressed forward, hoping to make it to the door before I was discovered. I moved through the room on my stomach, trying my best to stifle the sounds of pain I wanted to make due to my aching shoulder. As I reached for the door handle, I was suddenly illuminated by the beam of the flashlight.

“Stop it, Robert. You’ve seen enough of this closet’s skeletons, I fear.” Steven made his way toward me as I sat paralyzed in fear. “You won’t make it out there. They are well trained to deal with outsiders.”

“Steven, I-I don’t understand man. Listen, I just want to take Michelle and Clark and go home, I don’t understand any of this.” 

Steven stared at me with an expression of pure apathy. “I wouldn’t expect you to understand, Robert, but you should have never come here. The affairs that take place under this roof are not only private, but sacred.” 

“The puppet, he was walking down the street.” I was desperate to understand. It all felt unreal, like I was trapped in a waking nightmare.

“I felt terrible having him make the journey on his own, but the situation called for it. I never intended for you to find out about this place. When Mr. Jackknife got a taste for blood, it forced my hand to action.”

The door slammed open, and pushing through it was a giant mass of body parts. It looked like several of the puppeteers had all been melted together. It drug itself forward with its many arms and legs, and its heads all frantically looked in different directions. 

“Gently now, take him to a donation chair, please.” Following orders, the hulking beast wrapped me in a bundle of squirming arms. They felt incredibly smooth and soft, like the skin of a newborn. I found myself unable to struggle as I was dragged through the doors and out of the room. As we passed through the corridor, I saw rows and rows of giant human shaped molds. Some were empty, and others were closed, with latex dripping from the cracks in between the two halves.

In the next room, there were lines of chairs with shackles for the hands and feet. I began to struggle harder, and as I thrashed and tore at the monster's body it began to leak blood and let out groans of misery. I was thrown into a chair, and the monsters' many hands made light work of my bindings. It then turned around, and exited from where it came. 

I waited several minutes in the chair, my hands quivering in pure terror as I imagined what would happen next. Sweat rolled down my forehead, stinging my eyes with no hands to wipe them. Then the doors opened again. I shouted in pure terror, an animalistic guttural scream of pure agony. 

Crossing the threshold was Mr. Jackknife himself. He was being guided by two puppeteers, like an old lady being helped across the street. They released his arms and he began to lumber towards me with shaking footsteps.

The puppet had looked impressively realistic before, but this was different. Mr. Jackknife’s beady eyes rolled around in different directions in the flesh mound underneath his hat. Saliva bubbled in the small slit where a mouth should be. The shivering mass under the trenchcoat dripped with mucus and pulsated with an irregular heartbeat. In a few unsteady strides, he was right in front of me. He smelled like spoiled meat. I wretched and closed my eyes. I could feel his hot breath against my face as he took shallow, wheezing breaths. I listened with my eyes still shut tightly as he dislodged a blade from his body. He groaned in pain and the blade escaped with a sickening pop. 

My eyes shot open as the blade was drug down my forearm to my wrist. Blood began to pour out as I tried desperately to stay conscious. Mr. Jackknife lowered his massive head to my arm and began to feed. I flailed and panicked in a desperate attempt to escape, but the shackles restricted my every movement. 

The puppet’s feeding was interrupted by a push that caused him to topple to the ground. Michelle leapt onto the creature and began pulling a blade from his body. She twisted and shook the blade until blood ran down her palms and it came loose. She was like an animal, viciously stabbing Mr. Jackknife over and over again. She moved from his body to his head, putting out an eye with her frantic stabbing. Mr. Jackknife swung an arm and knocked Michelle off of him. He had bloody tears running down his face. He crawled through the metal doors where he had come from and disappeared down the hall.

She looked incredibly pale and her wound was still open and bleeding. I began to cry from pure relief as she undid my restraints. She smiled weakly and handed me my blood covered overshirt, gesturing to my gushing arm.

“You look like you need it just as much as me.” I pointed to her wounded head. 

“I’m alright, let’s get to a hospital,” Michelle responded, her smile failing to conceal her pain.

“We need to get Clark, he’s out in the car… I hope.”

We made our way back through the corridor. All of the puppets stood completely still, unmoving and waiting for orders. Laying just a few steps past the doorway was Mr. Jackknife collapsed in a pool of blood. Steven kneeled over him, his hand clutching a bleeding wound on his stomach. Tears rolled down his cheeks. His face was pale and his eyes fluttered, as if calling him closer and closer towards eternal sleep. 

“It’s a shame really, how all of this turned out. I wish I wouldn’t have had to cause so much pain.” Steven was speaking to nobody in particular, caressing the head of the deceased. A coughing fit ensued that sounded like it was dragging Steven closer and closer to hell. 

“He stabbed you, didn’t he?” I asked, anger in my voice. “Bet you never wanted any of these monsters feeding on *your* blood?”

“He hugged me, Robert,” Steven said, choking back another onslaught of tears. “He chose me over himself. Isn’t that beautiful? It’s a wonderful feeling, to be loved. He never knew he was anything but a normal man.”

I started towards the exit, with Michelle right behind me. After the door closed, the sound of sobs echoed from the inside. I walked toward the car, my head spinning. The car sat lonely at the end of the gravel drive now, covered in blood and dented beyond conceivable repair. I opened the driver's side door and confronted the truth. Clark was dead. We had promised to make a film together, and that promise had killed him. The spoils of all of our efforts reduced to blood and flesh. 

I moved him from the driver’s seat, and laid him down in the back. I left my dream back there with him. I could make a film someday, but I could never make a film with him. Before I knew it I had begun to sob. The world turned into smears of light in my eyes. Michelle was turned away, looking out the window. In her reflection, I saw tears running down her cheeks.

The car started with a groan. Both of the headlights had been destroyed, and I made my way down the drive in the pitch blackness. The drive gave way to the freedom of the road, and we plunged into the darkness together.

Thanks for all the great suggestions. I just got back and had an amazing time! This is what I ended up doing. It seems like most or all of this will be known to you already but in case someone else is thinking of checking out the West Coast of PR:

Day 1:

Arrived in Aguadilla and picked up my rental. Stopped at a coffee shop near Colon Park and explored the park, the malecon,  and the treehouse, while I waited to check into my Airbnb, in the centro.

Day 2:

Went to Crashboat Beach (beautiful, all due respect--but kind of just OK compared to the places I was about to see.)

Playa Pena Blanca – Wow – smaller than I expected but very peaceful and stunning.

Made my way to Surfer’s Beach and then did the long attached hike to Survivor Beach. The trail through the woods/”jungle” to get to Survivor Beach and the beach itself were highlights. Survivor Beach ended up being my favorite beach. The relative difficulty in getting there makes it all the more worth it. You climb down the rocks out of the brush and you’re on a long strip of beach where you may not see another person. (Which reminds me, bring water.)

I saw Casa de Colores, probably on the way back too, which I took a bunch of pictures of and tried to sketch.

Day 3 (twists and turns):

Gozlandia Falls – a huge preserve with trails that surround two main falls that offer you the opportunity to swing overhead on a rope and jump right into natural pools of water.  It also involves a long hike, although if you don’t want to trek up to the top you can just walk into a low-lying part of it. There’s a parking area and a restaurant. If you want to pay for parking with a debit card you have to pay for it at the restaurant and bring a receipt back to the parking attendant.

A note about Gozlandia and the hike from Surfer’s Beach to Survivor Beach. I am not an athlete or anything but I‘m in decent shape (in my late 40s): Bring water, and look where you are walking at all times. There are a million ways to break your ankle (or worse) if you’re not careful. With Survivor’s Beach, unlike Gozlandia, pretty much the only way in or out is to do the 20-30 minute hike.

Also, the waves at Surfer’s Beach and at Survivor Beach are rough. I got cocky at Survivor beach on my last day there and, no exaggeration, came the closest I ever have to drowning and getting thrown against the rocks once I got close enough to shore to get out.

Isabela/Playa Montones – From Gozlandia I used Google Maps to get to Playa Montones. But first I wanted to find a coffee shop. I intended to go to what I thought was a coffee shop/roastery, but was more likely just a brand of coffee sold at a food truck. I say this because when I got there I found myself at Guajataca Tunnel, the site of an unfinished train tunnel but there was no such coffee shop, just food trucks. I never followed up on the coffee. The tunnel and the cliffs and beach they were on were pretty cool for photos and a walk but just a quick stop really.

From there, I headed for Playa Montones, but Google Maps had a surprise for me. What looked like an ordinary stretch of highway maybe four miles long, turned out to be a narrow, wooded road up and down and around and through mountains and hills, where you had to stop and wait for a car on the other side to pass and hope you didn’t accidentally drive off the side or force the other vehicle to roll off theirs. It seemed to keep going and going and I don’t remember seeing any guard rails. I was just glad it was daytime and not raining and that I was well-rested. 

Eventually I got where I wanted to be, which was Playa Montones, suggested by a Redditor in this thread. It did not disappoint. I only realized after getting there that it’s probably called this because there’s at least one rock formation that’s like a mini-island that you can climb up and take in the view from. Some people were fishing off it. It’s sharp and craggy though so don’t go barefoot after you swim across to it.

Food:

I had the obligatory mofongo for dinner one night, probably this night, and it was pretty good, but no offense … I don’t know…just alright…  Kinda like a casserole. In fairness only the second I’ve ever had. One thing I learned with this and other dinners, was that the food there isn’t cheap. It’s fairly priced but if you have to eat out for most meals it adds up. Maybe it was because I was there during Thanksgiving week but it took effort to find open supermarkets and small cafés. The desserts were great. Ice cream and/or frappes (coco limon) every night just about. If you don’t drink like me, know that they only have Heineken (no thanks) nonalcs for beer but they do have plenty of mocktails.    

On the other hand, I had probably the most mouthwatering pork sandwich I’ve ever tasted at a place that looks very unremarkable called Panaderia Rico Pan. Not just the pork but the bread itself, which tasted freshly made (I didn’t ask).

And on another day, I got a great cheap breakfast at a place called Breakfast & Pastries by Sunflower.

I wanted to try some seafood but it was quite pricey, I was by myself so I probably would have housed it in ten minutes – but maybe next time I’ll splurge.

Day 4:

I started out at the Museo de Arte de Aguadilla y del Caribe and really liked it. The woman managing it and the people working there with her were super friendly and showed me around. They have a lot of nice work hanging. I didn’t have time but sometimes they have painting and maybe other art classes and workshops. There was a history museum across the street on Calle Progresso but it was closed for renovations.

Rincon:

I took a snorkeling tour of a marine reserve. It was short and sweet. A good way to start the day.  No one else signed up so I had a private tour of the reef with Rincon Diving & Snorkeling.

I then visited the Faro de Rincon, a lighthouse that offered some stunning views of the ocean and surrounding areas.

Day 5:


Cabo Rojo/Playa Sucia/LaParguera:

On the advice of the woman who runs a combination coffee shop/laundromat in the center of Aguadilla and which serves really, really good coffee (Burbujas del Mar Laundromat & Café)* I hiked (more marsh than jungle) to the lighthouse at Cabo Rojo, which had far fewer people around then the one at rincon and sat on top of amazing cliffs you could look over at the ocean. (But don’t look too far because there’s no railing!) Then I walked to Playa Sucia which was almost entirely empty and its own version of paradise. Highly recommend the whole thing. Saw lots of iguanas, geckos, and birds you don’t get to see when you’re freezing your ass off in NY City.

*That coffee was so good I bought a bag of it to take home. It’s called El Coqui. Didn’t taste quite the same though. Probably because they steamed the milk, used whole milk, the psychological effect of being back in a place where everybody is pissed off most of the time and it’s cold out--not sure. I’ll keep experimenting.

At night I went to the port area at La Parguera. The drive down was beautiful. Very rural, lots of farmland, the occasional horse, very hilly. The Port itself was a “tourist trap,” but that’s where Parguera Water Sports is, and they’re the company that took a group of us out to the bioluminescent bay. I chose to just swim after reading that the kayaking wasn’t worth it. The moon was almost full, so we had to swim under the pontoon took get the full experience. The captain and his helper were great and put a black tarp down to make the bioluminescence that much more visible. It was definitely worth doing---but I would like to try it again on a much darker night. I’d also like to try it in Vieques and/or Culebra on a future trip.

 

Day 6:

I did the Surfer’s Beach-to-Survivor Beach hike a second time and spent the rest of the day there.

 

Reddit/ChatGPT/Google Observations

The drivers are crazy and don’t signal and someone followed someone because they signaled and marked themselves as a tourist: FALSE – many people don’t signal but some do, and I did---and I didn’t find the drivers to be particularly aggressive

My own observation but to people familiar with the island already this is probably obvious/dumb: It’s already Christmas in Puerto Rico.

Safety: Felt completely safe throughout my trip.

 

TLDR: Go to Aguadilla, rent a car, explore the West Coast.

1pgpu4u,https://elevatuscoach.com/realignment-and-transformational-resilience-the-quiet-phase-where-real-change-begins/,Transformational Resilience Realignment and New Beginnings - Elevatus Coaching,"There is a stage in every major life reset that almost no one talks about. It is the point where the crisis has passed, but the clarity has not arrived. You are not falling apart anymore, but you are not fully rising either. You are living in the space between what ended and what is beginning.

That space is called Realignment.

Realignment is quiet. It does not feel dramatic or motivational. It shows up in small routines that rebuild your inner world long before anything on the outside changes.

When I went through my own Realignment season, my life was stable enough, but I knew I was not operating at the level I wanted. So I returned to grounding habits. A slow morning coffee. Time at the gym to reset my mind. A few minutes each day to imagine the future I wanted to grow into. Nothing fancy. Just steady action that helped me shift from surviving to rebuilding.

Realignment sits between truth and action. Collapse shows you something needs to change. Confrontation reveals what that change is. Realignment gives you a path to start living it.

If you feel stuck in the in-between, start with something small. One tiny habit for seven days. It gives you a place to stand while your direction returns.

Real change starts quietly, long before anyone else can see it.",1,1765132811.0,ElevatusCoaching,0,1.0,False

But I'm not able to find any information about its product name or generation. I'm also uncertain what to buy and what work needs doing to get it functional. I'll need to get a portafilter obviously, but I'm uncertain which ones are compatible with a unit this old. All I see are [GC portafilters](https://us.rok.coffee/products/naked-portafilter) and [Smartshot portafilters](https://us.rok.coffee/products/presso-smartshot-portafilter), but neither model matches what I've got here (note the clear plastic chamber, rather than an opaque, ribbed black one.

One other concern I have is that when I attempt to suck water into the chamber by raising the arms, it doesn't stay in the chamber but rather pours out into what would be the portafilter. Is this a problem/defect, or is it how all ROKs work?

In addition to the pictures, here are some notes:

* there's a perforated silicon disc just above the socket for the portafilter. I'm wondering if this is basically the [Presso Smartshot silicon screen](https://us.rok.coffee/products/presso-smartshot-silicone-screen), indicating that this is an earlier version of the Smartshot and I need to buy accessories for that model instead of the GC.
* the base has the year `2002` stamped into the bottom

Any advice or information you can provide is welcome. Thanks in advance.

1pgpt1o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pgpt1o,Update: What I bought & ate at a U.S. Norweigan festival,"Hei hei! Since folks were interested in the follow up, here’s some pics from the Norweigan festival at a local “Sons of Norway” lodge here in the U.S. for your judging 😅 Thanks for your tips on what to buy!

This is a very small event the group hosts once a year to open up the lodge to guests and sell imported Norweigan or other Scandinavian goods and homemade treats.  “Lodges” in the U.S. are an interchangeable term both for a cultural group run by 2nd+ gen immigrants and expats, and the houses or buildings they’re run out of that are usually renovated with cultural flourishes. This one is a renovated house in a random neighborhood. There is no major Scandinavian population here but this is outside of Washington, DC, where there are expats and small pockets of ancestry from everywhere. 

Of course this is not going to be completely authentic because…this isn’t in Norway 😂 Yes, the almond cakes were there again but I didn’t get to ask anybody what they’re about since y’all said they’re not a thing in Norway! You learn something new everyday. 

Anyway — bought for home:
- Kransekake cookies
- Fattimann
- Solo sodas 
- Nuggati 
- Nora lingonberry jam
- Toro RømmeGrøt
- Gudbrand brown cheese 
- 2 giant bars of Freida melkesjokalde😃😃😃

Ate there:
- Waffles with lingonberry jam (no brown cheese at the cafe this year!)
- Lefse with butter and cinnamon
- Hot dog in lefse
- Cardamom hot chocolate
- Norweigan coffee

The highlight of this festival are the things for kids: rides with a Fjord horse and petting the lundehunds and forest cats.

it started as heartburn and i went to the gp and was put on PPi;s to help with that. it helped with the heartburn and it was suspected i had a hiatal hernia which made sense given my history of heavy lifting, BJJ and being 120kg/265lb bodyweight at 6'2 so not the smallest guy.

i was put on terbinfine at the same time for a fungal infection and after about 4 weeks i felt quite noticeably worse with feeling nauseous after any BJJ sparring unless i took a cyclizine to block it out.

around the time of this i noticed any time id eat my pre training meal that i had eaten for years of 2 tins of tuna on baked potato's i felt unusually bloated and queasy after eating it, id eat this a solid 5 hours before training every day so i changed to scambled eggs on toast and felt better on that. this was back in july 25'

i would even notice after taking some sips of my water when first waking up in would feel like it just sat in my stomach and bloated from just drinking water, meals would take 6-8+ hours to fully digest and for the bloating to dissipate. the bloating is noticably worse after eating meals with fat in them, for example toast and wheatabix will go down noticably easier than anything fatty which will take ages to digest and i have to keep my per meal volume low. i'd also get this gnawing sensation epigastically which has improved a bit since my diet adjustments but unless i eat the most bland foods or do a long walk after eating the bloating is still very persistent and the queasy/nauseous feeling has worsened and become more chornic over time. i get a lot of belching, indigestion, would have terrible heart burn if not for the ppis and feel full after eating nowhere near what i used to eat (i used to eat a lot of large meals with very high protein for years to build muscle etc. ive always had a very large appetite) 

i went back to the dr to explain this and we did a full bloods panel and renal tests which all came back normal. the bloating/abdominal cramps worsened and my gp suspected i might have been reacting badly to the PPI's so moved me to famotidine, not as strong but seemed to suit better for the time being.

after researching with no symptom alleviation i had to stop training bjj and can only do the gym with keeping the intensity lower, i went back to the dr and he suspected potentially a h pylori infection so ordered a FIT test to check for blood in my stool as well as a h pylori test and a calprotectin test. the h pylori came back negative.

the fit test came back positive of 23 and meant i was told to have a colonoscopy to check for crohns/ UC  and obviously just to check for colon cancer, the colonoscopy was completely normal. the surgeon suspected a hiatal hernia to be the cause too, at this time my calprotectin hadnt come back and once that came back a week or so after it was 600+ very high and although not the most accurate, a clear sign inflammation was high in my upper gi.

my gp contacted a gastroenterologist asking for the next best route given the high calprotected and clear colonoscopy and they responded by saying an endoscopy would be a sensible idea and the high calprotectin is rarely found in isolated upper GI pathology and the recent positive result is likely to be secondary to an infective gastroenteritis or even NSAID usage (i wasnt taking any nsaids at all)

at the time leading up to this test result i was under the impression i might have had SIBO, a lot of symptoms seemed to match so i decided to go onto a carnivore diet as i had read that carnivore was good for symptom relief, everything was worse on this. my bloating was terrible i needed to walk for 30 mins after every meal just to not feel extremely bloated and nauseous. my stools were pale and greasy, i was clearly not digesting fats from the diet at all, i lost a considerble amount of weight over the week i did the diet and felt like death, the fatigue was unbearable. as soon as i stopped and went back to carbs i felt an improvement and my weight went back up.

i definitely think another repeat calprotectin would show a much lower count given my upper gi symptoms are not nearly as bad as they were on the carnivore diet at the time that i took this test

i explained this to the gp but every time they just dont seem to care for the pale stools.

symtoms haven't improved at all and of the last week or so ive had this dull ache in my mid left/central back, my posture is bad but i havnt had this sensation before, and after increasing my fiber intake in my diet considerably my stools havnt been too bad but the pale colour is still there.

i eat a healthy, what i would call normal diet with just recently increasing my fiber dramatically to help my gut.

i even had 6 eggs the other night on toast and the next morning i noticed a considerably more greasy stool and a lot looser than normal just from that meal alone.

around that time my heartburn was terrible, even on 40mg famotidine per day it was bad so i had to move back to the omperazole and im taking 40mg currently to prevent the heartburn.

im spending a large portion of my day feeling a low level of nausea/queasiness that comes and goes in waves but is waking me up in the night at times and its really quite unpleasant. i mentioned the pale stool and almost coffee granule looking stool when i wipe to the gp 2 days ago and again she glossed over it without a care because i have the endoscopy in 10 days time, but im not sure if that will even show anything given the problem is so likely to be more bile duct/pancreas etc (at least thats where my head is at given my research on my symptoms)

i went back to the urgent dr when my heartburn was terrible because i couldn't sleep and she recommended i move back across, and i had another full bloods panel and renal done again 2 days ago so just waiting for the results to come back from that in the next couple of days where im assuming its not going to show the fat malabsorption

im still awaiting the endoscopy in 10 days time but im just concerned they arent looking in the right place and my anxiety is getting really bad around it all because im good at catastrophising and immediately worry its pancreatic cancer because thats how my brain works so I'm just looking for anyone anecdotally or much better educated than myself to offer some advice. i feel like im going through all the steps im being told to but the focus was first on my colon, then my stomach/small intestines but i feel like theyre looking in the wrong place and its affecting my mental health dramatically.

its got to the point that I've just been tempted to buy my own CT scan privately  to get answers but don't know whether its worth doing.

i know its a long one but the waiting around and trying to google things is leading me down a very dark path hence coming on here looking for any help or advice i can get. thankyou in advance.",1,1765132627.0,AskDocs,1,0.67,False

My roommate's and my neighbor has two Ring cameras. She's in a first floor apartment right by the building door, so we absolutely have to walk by her door and her cameras. We thought it was a good idea when they first went up, so we could ask for any footage if (God forbid) anything were to happen, but she's been using them to track other tenants' comings and goings. This morning it came to a head.

My roommate and I went out last night and came home; no issue, normal Saturday night. This morning, we left the building to go get some coffee and when we came back, she yelled at us through the door that we came home late and my roommate covered up her face when we walked by. We looked at each other and I said ""Excuse me?"" to her clearly seething through the door. She continued to yell at us and say that we covered our faces (obviously not well enough if she could tell who it was!). My roommate doesn't even remember doing that, so I'm not totally convinced she's not just making something up.

She also yelled at my roommate for having a dog, as it's allowed by our lease and property management company. She has yelled at me and other tenants for ""slamming"" the garbage bin door (read: closing it, her window is right above the garbage area). She's lonely and bored and definitely needs a hobby to keep her off the Ring app.

  
Total privacy violation IMO, but the lease language doesn't have anything regarding cameras. So annoyed and feeling like she's trying to make people uncomfortable in their own living space. ",30,1765132611.0,neighborsfromhell,55,0.82,False

the night before, I texted ""all set for tomorrow?""  next morning, she's all in & good to go. 

but once i board the train & reach the destination station i text her i reached and she says something came up and she'll be arriving late. and i was okay with it. and told her to take her time. 

i roamed here and there. and then reached the venue. she finally texted she's out for the venue and will be reaching soon and there was traffic, so she arrived late. and i went downstairs to get her. i embraced her with a hug first not too tight just a light one and told her ""madam finnally graced us with her presence"" in a teasing way (it's what we do , tease & banter). so anyways we sat, chill, and the ambiance was too good. we ordered fries and her elbow was slipping while she rested her arm.. again and again and, each time she says ""im so clumsy"". and later panner chilli and i accidentally chewed and swallowed a whole ass chilli and bhot teekha laga bc. 

""ill be back, teekha laga hai"", while i stood. so, she had also brought chocolates for me and gave me 5 star and says, i didn't expect to give you these chocolates this way. while she laughed. 😭 

so i gave her the first bite. and ate the chocolate and felt better afterwards. and we were talking about each other's interests, manifestations, she loved calligraphy, she has 11 cats and one of the reasons she was late was because her new cat was sick and she had to take care of it. and 2.5 hours had passed, and finally we revealed the gifts we got for each other. let's talk about hers, she had brought a soft toy for me - a MONKEY! she calls me that, sort of a nickname.

also, a set of cars which had all avengers logos and theme on it (the rip off ones) she knows i love cars & superhero stuff. she was sorry because she didn't pack and all as she didn't have time. 

thought i wouldn't like it but hell naah, i loved it. just not the avengers one (don't tell her this) but the MONKEY was a great touch from her end.

and there comes mine... i had specially got her one hot wheels car (FELINE LUCKY) that has a cat on it and she loves cats, but so do i. that's how we vibed. i had it packed with a red wrapper & fancy carry bag also.. a white rose. 🌹i was going for a red one, but thought it'd be too much for first date so i went for a white one instead. 

before leaving, we clicked selfies, goofed around. and exited the place as photos were not coming in clear and good. 

and the rest of the date.. was totally unplanned! 

the moment we were outside, she wanted to go inside a new store that was opened. and she wanted to check some clothes for her. she wants me to guess from which section she gets the clothes from.. KIDS SECTION, since she's so small in height, i keep poking her and tease , ""such a kid. choti bachi ho kya?"" and there were many mirrors so we clicked photos there.. there's that. and it was nothing she could find there. waha bhi timepass hi kiya for like 20 mins. but enjoyed each other's company. :)  she's not a walker. but, she chooses to walk with me :) the juice shop was 11 minutes away. so obviously she walks slowly and i walk fast because that is my normal speed. ""i hope im not going too fast"" yes you are, she replied. i then slow down.

and then we have our first physical touch. when crossing the road ; give me your hand, she held my hand but didn't interlock the fingers right away just grabbed the fingers, that's all.

she gets the menu, and asks me which juice i want.. i then tell her i'd like to have mango shake, but since it's not mango season he probably doesn't have it. and that's how i get told NO in every juice shop. you wanna hear it? i asked the owner, "" bhaiya mango shake ni hoga na? season to hai nai"". and the owner being savage, no words nothing just points his head towards those mangoes that were hanging. and she started teasing about this. 💀 so she says, let's have mango shake. we have 1 glass and 2 spoons while we finish it. and we then go for a long walk in the roadsides. she's terrible with the google maps she reveals, but i also tell her that i remember the place too well.. but if you'd ask me where that place is..i probably won't be able to tell you. 

so she trusted me with the road and route and i suck at this too.. but idk why and how i remembered the route back where we were at the juice shop. we took a walk for like half hour or more & my arm was on her shoulder - on/off. there were talking about, family, interests, her friend circle. how we both hate and feared of cockroaches also how i killed em in the childhood. 

the roadside was not proper, so i held her hand each time so she wouldn't fall or slip. we talked to randomly on stuff and we wouldn't stop at all. and we then sat on a random straight slab for 2 WHOLE HOURS. just the 2 of us.. cars passing by, people crossing.. random cats and dogs.. there conversations become deeper. i tell her i eat my lunch alone at work because sometimes i like being in my own space after such a stressful environment and tasks, being with the same people again i just don't like it. 

she knows it well that i don't talk with my colleagues unless there is work involved i don't joke or anything just focused on work, so i made this clear. and she agreed with me on this. and each time we got a phone call or some text from someone we kept apologising, that we'll be quick. because that's how it is picking up phone on a date and using it? not cool. then on this matter - i said, ""I don't even like to use my phone. ""yeah? will you survive without it then?"", she asks. 

i said i can 100% survive without my phone and internet but.. under one condition only if im with the right person during the time & she feels the same about it. 

we then shift to the work topic , how she gets along with almost everyone when it's not work. but me? total opposite. only talking when there's work involved. who's our favourite person in the office. (obviously excluding ourselves) because we like each other,  hence why we planned a date. so.. lots of talking was there, on deep and random topics. that lasted 2 hours. and it was like 11 PM and she was worried for me because my place is far from her place i may reach late and not get the train on time. 

this time when we crossed the road, we held hands.. but interlocked the fingers as well. 🙂‍↕️ for a brief 10 secs and she was the one to lose it, and it was okay for me. 

i told her i hadn't had tea for the evening. i am a chai person and she is a coffee person. 

so i get my phone and search for the nearby tea shop opened, she immediately grabs my phone and tells me don't put it on the map i will find it for you. she didn't know the place just like me , we take a small walk and she finally finds one.. but she stops and tells me she'll only enter the shop only if she'll pay i say c'mon yea fine. (she doesn't know ill pay this time as well) hehe..

our timing was quite right, because when we entered the shop it was about to close and the owner requested us to order all in once as the kitchen will be closed soon. I got chai and she asked me to pick one for her.. and i chose oreo milkshake. until it was getting ready. we were clicking photos of each other. and i asked her to me how to pose because i suck at it. she knows it well. 

i clicked hers too. and she liked those photos. 

i said : obviously the photos would come good, because the person in the frame is also good na. :p

our order arrives, and i ask her what type of romances do you like in movies? she tells where there's a happy ending. fair enough. okay. but she doesn't like if deaths are there in the movie. 

i come with another point, i agree a happy ending must be there. but i think if a certain character's death is involved and it is important for the other character's development and life, i will call it bittersweet. and it was finally time to leave. i pay the bill ofcourse. 
she booked a rickshaw, to the station where ill be going from so we could be together the last time and not part ways like that.

we are again together, this time.. close. i have my arm on her shoulder. not too close just a little. 

she tells me, text me when you reach home, if a stranger comes at you and gives you a chocolate don't take it. you run away. ""i say bol bhi kon raha hai. someone who's a shorty and choti bachi."" so anyways we arrive at the station, she tells me you can leave ill book the cab and go. i say nope. im not leaving until the cab arrives, you tell him the OTP, sit & go. 

we stay close because a random drunk beggar kept coming to us for money. i kindly say please jao yaha se. we change the place and he again comes to me, i hold her hand, keep her on my side & say, stay close to me and the man again approaches me. this time i got angry and said, ""arey bhai bola nai aao idhar waha dur jao kisi or se mangho!"" she was quite scared. and then.. she lets go of my hand when the man goes away. 

and after some time.. something happens which i did not expect at all... 

she suddenly, grabs my arm and holds it. very close to her & slightly squeezes it. during this whole time i was the one initiating the touch.. like poking, tickling, holding hand when crossing the road. and she giving it back. it was very real. and i felt quite good. never felt something like this ever before. 

and her cab arrived. i opened the door, and she sat .. and me just being me.. i hugged her when she sat.. it was an awkward side hug.

This is only in my right ankle when elevated. Noticed it while drinking my coffee. I did a lot of walking yesterday & have lower back pain, though that's pretty standard for me. Haven't walked much today. 

I have a physical soon, wondering if it is worth bringing up or if it’s considered normal. Not painful, feet aren't discolored or anything. I've had EMG a few times (bc of foot droop & stenosis), no nerve damage that would cause reduced sensation. I think that covers it? Lmk if I can provide additional info.

I then noticed a long line of people pouring out of a packed church parking lot. Peeped the clock and it was 1pm. I’ve already walked my dog and did all my errands for the day. Already home and sitting on my porch, relaxing and will have a nice lunch with my husband soon.

Maybe I’ll play some video games and watch some soccer. All things I never would have been allowed to do as a fundie child. Have a special drink/treat I wanted? Never. Pick out wrapping paper I liked? Never. Get to take a nap on a Sunday? Never. Wear a comfy hoodie and jeans AND no church??? Watch a sport I enjoyed instead of American football? Never. Play video games that have witches doing magic? Satan, get thee behind me! NEVER

Had a flash of resentment thinking about how my parents are at home relaxing today, because while they have remained fundies in their day to day speak, they both stopped going to church, as soon as I moved out of the house. So it was just a special brainwashing chore they used just for me. All to make me a submissive and obedient young lady. It was so important my entire life, until they didn’t have to force me to go anymore at 18.

But I’ll try to let that resentment go and hold on to the silver lining, which is my freedom. I’m going to decorate my tree today and maybe make myself a nice Christmas cocktail. Happy Holidays, everyone! You’re free too, and I hope you do something special for just yourself this season( since you don’t have to be sitting in a room for multiple days and hours a week feeling shame for doing nothing but existing)! You deserve to have a little something for yourself and life is beautiful and worth living and so are all of you! ",7,1765132256.0,exchristian,0,0.9,False

1pgplfu,https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningToBecome/comments/1pgplfu/neil_degrasse_tyson_do_this_every_morning_to_find/,Neil deGrasse Tyson: do THIS every morning to find happiness & meaning in your life,"Lately, I’ve noticed an alarming trend. People chasing happiness like it’s some hidden treasure they’ll unlock after perfecting their 5AM cold plunges, romanticizing burnout, or manifesting their dream life under a full moon. Instagram is packed with 20-second reels telling you that “positivity is a mindset” or “you just gotta vibe higher.” But most of that advice? It’s spiritual junk food, snappy, flashy, seductive, and totally lacking actual substance.

So I dug deep into actual research, books, long-form interviews, and lectures from real experts who understand humans, biology, and the science of fulfillment. And one name kept showing up: astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson.

He’s the last person you’d expect to give life advice. But his core message? A daily dose of cosmic perspective can literally rewire how you experience the world. And it’s not woo-woo. It’s backed by decades of research in psychology, evolutionary biology, and even mindfulness science. What Tyson suggests sounds simple but hits you existentially hard: every morning, remind yourself of your place in the universe.

So here’s how that one tiny mindset shift can change your entire approach to life.

- Neil deGrasse Tyson talks often about “cosmic humility”, a mindset where you realize you are both insignificant AND incredibly rare. You’re stardust that can think. That realization, he says, dissolves ego and brings more awe than any tropical vacation. This isn’t poetic, it’s factual. In his book “Astrophysics for People in a Hurry,” he explains how the atoms in your body were forged in collapsing stars. You’re not separate from the universe. You are it. Knowing that? Radical shift.

- Clinical psychologist Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett (author of “Seven and a Half Lessons About the Brain”) explains that so much of our stress and unhappiness comes from the brain trying to make meaning out of chaos. But when you zoom out, cosmically, it forces your brain to contextualize your problems. Suddenly, your late email reply or awkward date feels… less life-ending.

- Research published in Psychological Science (Keltner & Haidt, 2003) shows that experiences of awe increase wellbeing, prosocial behavior, and reduce anxiety. Awe is triggered when you feel connected to something vast and bigger than yourself. Cosmic reflection in the morning does exactly that. You don’t need a telescope. Just a few quiet minutes of universal context.

- Andrew Huberman (neuroscientist at Stanford) talks in multiple episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast about how your brain builds your reality through attention. If you start your day contemplating human existence on a planetary or galactic scale, your anxiety circuits actually calm down. Because you’re shifting your attention from me-centered rumination to universe-centered awareness.

- Behavioral psychologist Dr. Laurie Santos (The Happiness Lab podcast) mentions that one of the quickest shortcuts to meaning is stopping to reflect on your mortality and transience, without spiraling. She calls it “productive existentialism.” Tyson’s approach nails this. The fact that you exist at all should blow your mind.

If you want to try this daily cosmic shift, here are small tools that work:

- Insight Timer: Tons of free guided meditations, but there’s one category called “Perspective” that specifically includes lessons from physicists, philosophers, and psychologists to help reframe your place in the universe. Listening to one while you're brushing teeth = unexpected magic.

- theAsh.app: A lesser-known gem that pairs you with mini daily mental health nudges. One morning prompt literally said “You exist in a blink of cosmic time. What will you do today?” Wildly grounding. It’s basically cosmic therapy without being cringe.

- BeFreed: A personalized audio learning app like Duolingo x MasterClass that has a super cute avatar Freedia. It recently went viral on X (1M+ views) and is built by AI experts from Google and Columbia. You just type what you want to grow into, like “become more awe-aware” or “understand time and mortality”, and it pulls from top books, expert talks, and research papers to generate podcast-style lessons. You can even pick the voice (I use the calm one before bed) and switch between 10-minute summaries or 40-minute deep dives. I’ve replaced my morning scroll time with BeFreed and I’m way less foggy, more grounded, and actually retain what I learn.

- Kurzgesagt (YouTube): Their animated explainer videos, like “The Egg” or “How to Make Life Meaningful,” hit like existential sermons. Watch one in the morning instead of doomscrolling. The visuals plus narration = pure dopamine + awe spike.

- Lex Fridman Podcast episode 267 with Neil deGrasse Tyson: They discuss mortality, the wonder of science, and why understanding our smallness doesn’t depress us, it frees us. Watch it with coffee. Bet you’ll cry a little.

- Book rec: “The Order of Time” by Carlo Rovelli. This isn’t just a book, it’s a revelation. Written by one of Italy’s most respected theoretical physicists, it’s been a Sunday Times bestseller and is hauntingly poetic. Rovelli blends physics with philosophy to make you feel time in a completely new way. I literally clutched the book after finishing it. It’s the best book on time and meaning I’ve ever read. This book will make you question everything you think you know about your life.

- Meditation tip from Sam Harris’ Waking Up app: Begin your day by picturing the Earth from space. You, on a small dot of dust floating in blackness. He guides you through the exercise in “The Space of Consciousness” series. It’s not woo-woo. It’s pure existential clarity.

- Book rec: “Four Thousand Weeks” by Oliver Burkeman. New York Times bestseller. This is the time management book for people who are tired of optimizing their to-do lists and want to learn how to actually enjoy being alive. Burkeman blends philosophy, psychology, and dry British humor. This book is devastating in the best way. It’s the best book I’ve ever read about making peace with time and finitude.

- Podcast rec: The Happiness Lab with Dr. Laurie Santos. Her episode “Awe Walks” dives into how regular doses of awe reset your brain and boost daily joy. Most people chase stimulation in the morning. Try awe instead.

You don’t have to wake up and quote Carl Sagan. Just take one minute each morning to zoom out. Remember you’re atoms that can think. You’re alive on a floating rock. And that’s kind of insane.

Most influencers will tell you to “journal 3 things you’re grateful for.” Cool. But ask yourself this instead: “What do I do with a life I didn’t ask for, on a planet that’s 4.5 billion years old, inside a universe I barely understand?”

That one question can melt anxiety, kill ego, and spark action, all before breakfast.

1pgpl77,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipIndia/comments/1pgpl77/i_22m_just_had_my_first_ever_date_with_a/,I 22M just had my first ever date with a colleague 25F yesterday & here's how it went.,"TLDR - i had my first ever date and it went well. 80% of it was unplanned. 

the night before, I texted ""all set for tomorrow?""  next morning, she's all in & good to go. 

but once i board the train & reach the destination station i text her i reached and she says something came up and she'll be arriving late. and i was okay with it. and told her to take her time. 

i roamed here and there. and then reached the venue. she finally texted she's out for the venue and will be reaching soon and there was traffic, so she arrived late. and i went downstairs to get her. i embraced her with a hug first not too tight just a light one and told her ""madam finnally graced us with her presence"" in a teasing way (it's what we do , tease & banter). so anyways we sat, chill, and the ambiance was too good. we ordered fries and her elbow was slipping while she rested her arm.. again and again and, each time she says ""im so clumsy"". and later panner chilli and i accidentally chewed and swallowed a whole ass chilli and bhot teekha laga bc. 

""ill be back, teekha laga hai"", while i stood. so, she had also brought chocolates for me and gave me 5 star and says, i didn't expect to give you these chocolates this way. while she laughed. 😭 

so i gave her the first bite. and ate the chocolate and felt better afterwards. and we were talking about each other's interests, manifestations, she loved calligraphy, she has 11 cats and one of the reasons she was late was because her new cat was sick and she had to take care of it. and 2.5 hours had passed, and finally we revealed the gifts we got for each other. let's talk about hers, she had brought a soft toy for me - a MONKEY! she calls me that, sort of a nickname.

also, a set of cars which had all avengers logos and theme on it (the rip off ones) she knows i love cars & superhero stuff. she was sorry because she didn't pack and all as she didn't have time. 

thought i wouldn't like it but hell naah, i loved it. just not the avengers one (don't tell her this) but the MONKEY was a great touch from her end.

and there comes mine... i had specially got her one hot wheels car (FELINE LUCKY) that has a cat on it and she loves cats, but so do i. that's how we vibed. i had it packed with a red wrapper & fancy carry bag also.. a white rose. 🌹i was going for a red one, but thought it'd be too much for first date so i went for a white one instead. 

before leaving, we clicked selfies, goofed around. and exited the place as photos were not coming in clear and good. 

and the rest of the date.. was totally unplanned! 

the moment we were outside, she wanted to go inside a new store that was opened. and she wanted to check some clothes for her. she wants me to guess from which section she gets the clothes from.. KIDS SECTION, since she's so small in height, i keep poking her and tease , ""such a kid. choti bachi ho kya?"" and there were many mirrors so we clicked photos there.. there's that. and it was nothing she could find there. waha bhi timepass hi kiya for like 20 mins. but enjoyed each other's company. :)  she's not a walker. but, she chooses to walk with me :) the juice shop was 11 minutes away. so obviously she walks slowly and i walk fast because that is my normal speed. ""i hope im not going too fast"" yes you are, she replied. i then slow down.

and then we have our first physical touch. when crossing the road ; give me your hand, she held my hand but didn't interlock the fingers right away just grabbed the fingers, that's all.

she gets the menu, and asks me which juice i want.. i then tell her i'd like to have mango shake, but since it's not mango season he probably doesn't have it. and that's how i get told NO in every juice shop. you wanna hear it? i asked the owner, "" bhaiya mango shake ni hoga na? season to hai nai"". and the owner being savage, no words nothing just points his head towards those mangoes that were hanging. and she started teasing about this. 💀 so she says, let's have mango shake. we have 1 glass and 2 spoons while we finish it. and we then go for a long walk in the roadsides. she's terrible with the google maps she reveals, but i also tell her that i remember the place too well.. but if you'd ask me where that place is..i probably won't be able to tell you. 

so she trusted me with the road and route and i suck at this too.. but idk why and how i remembered the route back where we were at the juice shop. we took a walk for like half hour or more & my arm was on her shoulder - on/off. there were talking about, family, interests, her friend circle. how we both hate and feared of cockroaches also how i killed em in the childhood. 

the roadside was not proper, so i held her hand each time so she wouldn't fall or slip. we talked to randomly on stuff and we wouldn't stop at all. and we then sat on a random straight slab for 2 WHOLE HOURS. just the 2 of us.. cars passing by, people crossing.. random cats and dogs.. there conversations become deeper. i tell her i eat my lunch alone at work because sometimes i like being in my own space after such a stressful environment and tasks, being with the same people again i just don't like it. 

she knows it well that i don't talk with my colleagues unless there is work involved i don't joke or anything just focused on work, so i made this clear. and she agreed with me on this. and each time we got a phone call or some text from someone we kept apologising, that we'll be quick. because that's how it is picking up phone on a date and using it? not cool. then on this matter - i said, ""I don't even like to use my phone. ""yeah? will you survive without it then?"", she asks. 

i said i can 100% survive without my phone and internet but.. under one condition only if im with the right person during the time & she feels the same about it. 

we then shift to the work topic , how she gets along with almost everyone when it's not work. but me? total opposite. only talking when there's work involved. who's our favourite person in the office. (obviously excluding ourselves) because we like each other,  hence why we planned a date. so.. lots of talking was there, on deep and random topics. that lasted 2 hours. and it was like 11 PM and she was worried for me because my place is far from her place i may reach late and not get the train on time. 

this time when we crossed the road, we held hands.. but interlocked the fingers as well. 🙂‍↕️ for a brief 10 secs and she was the one to lose it, and it was okay for me. 

i told her i hadn't had tea for the evening. i am a chai person and she is a coffee person. 

so i get my phone and search for the nearby tea shop opened, she immediately grabs my phone and tells me don't put it on the map i will find it for you. she didn't know the place just like me , we take a small walk and she finally finds one.. but she stops and tells me she'll only enter the shop only if she'll pay i say c'mon yea fine. (she doesn't know ill pay this time as well) hehe..

our timing was quite right, because when we entered the shop it was about to close and the owner requested us to order all in once as the kitchen will be closed soon. I got chai and she asked me to pick one for her.. and i chose oreo milkshake. until it was getting ready. we were clicking photos of each other. and i asked her to me how to pose because i suck at it. she knows it well. 

i clicked hers too. and she liked those photos. 

i said : obviously the photos would come good, because the person in the frame is also good na. :p

our order arrives, and i ask her what type of romances do you like in movies? she tells where there's a happy ending. fair enough. okay. but she doesn't like if deaths are there in the movie. 

i come with another point, i agree a happy ending must be there. but i think if a certain character's death is involved and it is important for the other character's development and life, i will call it bittersweet. and it was finally time to leave. i pay the bill ofcourse. 
she booked a rickshaw, to the station where ill be going from so we could be together the last time and not part ways like that.

we are again together, this time.. close. i have my arm on her shoulder. not too close just a little. 

she tells me, text me when you reach home, if a stranger comes at you and gives you a chocolate don't take it. you run away. ""i say bol bhi kon raha hai. someone who's a shorty and choti bachi."" so anyways we arrive at the station, she tells me you can leave ill book the cab and go. i say nope. im not leaving until the cab arrives, you tell him the OTP, sit & go. 

we stay close because a random drunk beggar kept coming to us for money. i kindly say please jao yaha se. we change the place and he again comes to me, i hold her hand, keep her on my side & say, stay close to me and the man again approaches me. this time i got angry and said, ""arey bhai bola nai aao idhar waha dur jao kisi or se mangho!"" she was quite scared. and then.. she lets go of my hand when the man goes away. 

and after some time.. something happens which i did not expect at all... 

she suddenly, grabs my arm and holds it. very close to her & slightly squeezes it. during this whole time i was the one initiating the touch.. like poking, tickling, holding hand when crossing the road. and she giving it back. it was very real. and i felt quite good. never felt something like this ever before. 

and her cab arrived. i opened the door, and she sat .. and me just being me.. i hugged her when she sat.. it was an awkward side hug. ""step outside, we'll have a proper hug."" and i hugged her, gently. this time a lil closer. but not too long. and i tell her to text me when she reaches home. and.. that. was. it. this was the longest ive ever spent time alone with a girl. 7 HOURS!! i can't believe. i thought i would mess it up and was overthinking everything before the date. but everything went well.

I hadn’t touched a piano since Claire died six years ago.

She taught me everything. How to read sheet music. Where to loosen tension and where to hold it. How posture shapes sound and how patience shapes art. She played with this delicate, deliberate grace. It was like her fingers didn’t just press the keys, but also understood them. Music wasn’t just something she made, it was something she was.

I thought we would live a good life. Marriage, a house, maybe kids. We’d grow old together, hands still brushing as we played duets on some dusty upright in our living room.

But then came the diagnosis: brain cancer. Terminal. Sudden. She faded quickly. Her eyes lost their spark, her fingers their control. The music left her long before she left me.

Her final days were in a hospital bed, where tubes hummed in place of melodies. Just before the end, she made me promise I’d keep playing. For her. I gave her my word as I held her hand and felt her pulse disappear beneath my fingertips.

But I couldn’t do it. Every note sounded like her ghost.

I didn’t sell the piano. That would’ve been like discarding her soul. I just covered it, a white sheet draped over it like a shroud. It sat in silence, mourning with me.

Then, one morning, I found a letter on my kitchen table.

I didn’t hear anyone come in. Didn’t see the door move. At first, I thought nothing of it. But the envelope was thick and yellowed, like parchment pried from a tomb. My full name, *Liam Goodpray*, was written in fine, looping cursive. No stamp. No return address.

The first thing I noticed as I picked it up was the smell.

I must’ve been imagining it. How could I not be? It carried a faint trace of Claire’s favorite perfume. Lavender. Soft, calming. But there was something else beneath it now, something colder, sharper. Metallic, like old blood or a rusted key.

Maybe it was just the scent of memory decaying. Maybe it was grief finally finding new ways to haunt me.

I sat down at the table and turned the envelope over in my hands. The paper felt thick, almost damp, like it had been waiting somewhere dark for a very long time. My fingers hesitated at the flap. For a moment, I was afraid to open it, afraid of what it might say.

But curiosity is a quiet kind of hunger. And it always wins.

I broke the seal. Inside was a single sheet, folded twice. The handwriting matched the envelope: elegant, flowing script that looked carved more than written. Each letter precise. Familiar.

I began to read.

“To Mr. Liam Goodpray,

You are cordially invited to perform at the Bellmare Concert Hall, located in our old town of Dorset Hollow. One night, one recital.

Compensation: Solace

Mr. Wellers awaits you.”

That was all it said.

No instructions, no contact information. Just the offer—signed by a name I’d never heard before—and a faded, brittle map inked on the back. No phone number. No email. Just parchment and mystery.

I actually laughed out loud. *Solace?* What kind of payment is that?

But the laugh didn’t last long.

Something stirred in my memory, an old rumor about Dorset Hollow. A fire. Long ago. The kind of story whispered by locals too tired to care and too afraid to dig. They said the town was swallowed whole by flames no one could stop. Just gone. Vanished under smoke and ash.

No one ever talked about what came after. Whether it was rebuilt or left behind like a bad dream. Over time, it just faded from maps and minds. A ghost of a town, that no one cared about anymore. And now, here I was, standing in my kitchen, holding a letter summoning me back to it.

I won’t lie, it piqued my curiosity. But I didn’t make any decisions. Not then. I just folded the letter back up, placed it gently on the table where I’d found it, and walked away.

I dreamed of Claire that night. She was onstage, but not dressed for it. She wasn't in the blue dress she used to wear to her performances. She sat there barefoot in black jeans and a faded Nirvana shirt. Her black hair fell to her shoulders. And her eyes, those deep blue eyes. The kind you look into and can never see the bottom.

She was playing something I didn’t recognize. It was beautiful, yet impossible, like trying to comprehend the full scale of the universe. The music sounded like the concept of grief. Pure, unadulterated grief. Grief so deep it was sacred.

I stood there, unable to move, watching her hands glide over the keys like they still remembered everything this world had taken from her.

She simply looked at me and said, “Don’t go.” No fear or worry, just pleading.

I woke up shaking.

And there, on my nightstand, was the letter.

I went through my morning routine on autopilot. Coffee. Cold water to the face. Clothes. Keys.

Then I got in the car.

After the dream, after Claire’s voice in my head, I needed to see Dorset Hollow. I told myself I wasn’t going to perform. I wasn’t even going to touch its piano. I just wanted to *see* it. That’s what I told myself. Over, and over, and over again.

The drive took five hours. Back roads the whole way. Twisting ribbons of cracked asphalt, no signs, no traffic. Halfway there, the GPS gave out entirely. The screen just froze on a blank patch of nowhere. So I used the map from the back of the letter. It was nearly illegible, faded lines like veins on old skin, as if it was trying to vanish with time. Like it *didn’t want* to be followed. But I traced the path anyway.

The trees thickened as I drove deeper in. The road narrowed to a breath. The usual sounds of the forest—birds, wind, insects—began to fade, one by one, until there was only the hum of my engine. Even that started to feel distant, like it was being swallowed by the air around me. The further I drove, the more the light changed. The sky turned gray, like the world was slowly being drained of hue.

Then I saw the sign. A wooden plaque, rotted at the edges, carved in an old-fashioned serif:

**“Dorset Hollow: A Place for Quiet Reflection.”**

The town looked preserved, paused, as if time had decided to stop flowing here and never started again. It looked like someone had tried to restore it, faithfully and lovingly, back to what it might have been decades ago. Maybe the fire was real. Maybe they rebuilt it, but if they did, they rebuilt it too well.

The buildings stood upright and well-kept, their paint untouched by weather or age. But there was something hollow in their stance, like they were facades of real places.

The windows were especially strange. Clear as crystal, but dim, like they were reflecting moonlight instead of basking in the afternoon sun. I could see my car clock said 1:13 p.m., but everything around me felt like dusk.

The most intriguing thing, however, was that the streets were empty. I didn't see a single soul in sight.

And I don't know how to explain it, but I knew people were there. I could feel them, just out of view. Just around the corner, watching without watching.

Then I saw the diner.

Simple. Modest. It sat on the corner like a prop from an old TV show. Its neon sign buzzed softly, the “N” flickering every few seconds.

**DIN(N)ER.**  
Clever.

I hadn’t eaten all day, and despite the strangeness of it all, the place felt… comforting. Familiar, even. Like a memory from someone else’s life.

I pulled in.

The interior was straight out of 1965: black-and-white checkered floors, red vinyl booths, chrome fixtures that caught the dim light like they were polished just minutes ago. An old jukebox stood in the corner, humming faintly, waiting for coins. The whole diner smelled like hot coffee, bacon grease, and a hint of lemon floor polish.

Three customers were seated: an older couple in the corner booth, and a man about my age sitting alone by the window.

All three looked at me when I walked in, like they’d been expecting me.

I slid into an empty booth, the red vinyl squeaking under me. A moment later, the waitress approached. Her hair was pulled into a tight ponytail, not a strand out of place. Her lipstick was too red for a town this faded, like something from a poster instead of a person. She smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes. They looked hollow, like the windows outside. Clear, but distant.

“You headed to the concert hall?” she asked, handing me a menu.

“How’d you know?” I asked, more unsettled than curious.

She shrugged and glanced off toward some vague direction, “Not many folks come by here unless they’ve been invited.”

Alright, that made sense. I gave her my order, just coffee and something simple, but she didn’t write anything down.

A few minutes later, she brought over a feast fit for kings. Black coffee, scrambled eggs, perfectly-buttered toast, and a side of crispy bacon. It smelled like memory.

And when I took a bite, it tasted like childhood. Sunday mornings, cartoons humming from another room, someone humming a tune you forgot the name of. Warm. Familiar. A little *too* perfect.

Across the diner, the young man in the window booth looked up.

“You play?” he asked.

I paused, unsure if I wanted to answer.

“Used to,” I said finally.

He nodded, slow and solemn, like that was the only answer anyone ever gave.

“That’s good enough for Bellmare.”

I offered a weak smile. “You been?”

But he didn’t answer. Just lowered his gaze and stared back down at his food, suddenly uninterested.

I reached for my wallet, but before I could pull it out, the waitress was already there, hand out like a gentle warning.

“It’s covered,” she said.

“By who?”

She gave a small shrug. “Mr. Wellers. He takes care of his guests.”

“Nice guy,” I said, more to myself than to her, and left a five on the table anyway.

Bellmare Hall stood at the very edge of town, where the sidewalk gave way to dirt, and the dirt turned to forest.

It didn’t fit Dorset Hollow. Not even close. Where the town was quaint, Bellmare was monumental. Where the streets were quiet, Bellmare was imposing.

The structure was carved from pale stone streaked with veins of deep gray, like smoke frozen in marble. The surface was smooth in places and weathered in others, as if time had tried, and failed, to erode it.

Vines clung to the walls like veins on skin, winding up the facade toward tall iron lanterns that still flickered with open flame. The air smelled faintly of wax and old wood.

But it was the details that really impressed me.

Engraved into the walls and columns were figures, human figures, draped in flowing robes like Roman statues. Each of them were frozen in acts of music. Some held violins, others cellos or flutes, their hands positioned mid-note. Their faces were serene, solemn, or ecstatic. Captured expressions of people who had long since played their final piece. Along the trim and archways were the likenesses of instruments—violins, grand pianos, harps, even unfamiliar, archaic ones—woven into the architecture like sacred symbols.

The great doors stood twelve feet tall, made of dark-stained wood reinforced with iron bands, a knocker shaped like a curled treble clef hanging in the center.

It stood like a grand cathedral to music: solemn, sacred, and built not to echo prayers, but to cradle every note and melody like a holy relic. Every inch of the place radiated the feeling that something important had happened here, or was perhaps about to.

I wouldn't have known whether I was meant to walk in, or wait to be summoned.

But a man stood waiting on the stairs. He was unnaturally tall. Scarily thin. He wore a charcoal-gray suit that clung to him like it had been sewn on in another century. A black top hat perched neatly over a few stubborn tufts of white hair, as if it was clinging to his scalp out of habit more than life.

His skin was paper-white, thin enough to see faint blue veins beneath the surface. His eyes were glazed and colorless, like glass that had forgotten what it used to reflect. It looked like today was his funeral, and he’d forgotten to attend.

“Mr. Goodpray,” he said, voice smooth with a Southern drawl, low and slow. “Mr. Wellers welcomes you.”

His smile was polite. Inviting. Practiced.

“You’re Mr. Wellers?” I asked.

He nodded once, sharp and controlled. “Some call Wellers that.”

“Is that what *you* call you?”

He tilted his head slightly, letting a thin smirk crease one side of his mouth, like my question was an inside joke. “Mr. Wellers prefers to keep things proper.”

That didn’t answer anything. But I let it go.

“Wellers is glad you chose to perform in our humble town,” he said, almost offhandedly, as if we were discussing the weather.

I stopped walking.

“I didn’t say I came to perform,” I said, my eyes fixed on his. “I came to *look*. To see the hall. That’s it.”

Mr. Wellers turned back to face me fully, hands clasped gently in front of him. He tilted his head in a gesture that was either curiosity or condescension, it was hard to tell.

“No one ever says they came to perform,” he replied smoothly. “Not at first. They say they come to look. To remember. To pass through.”

“I mean it,” I said. “I haven’t touched a piano in six years.”

“Yes,” he said softly. “Wellers knows.”

That answer froze the words in my throat.

He smiled again.

“But something brought you here, didn’t it?” he continued. “Something more than curiosity. Grief, perhaps. Or hope. Or maybe... maybe you’re just looking for something to make the silence bearable again.”

“I didn’t agree to anything,” I said, slower now.

“But you came,” he replied, his voice dipped in certainty. “And *that*, Mr. Goodpray, means you’ve already begun to agree. The decision always starts with the arrival. Everything after that is just the song playing itself out.”

I stared at him, heart heavier than I wanted to admit.

He took a single step toward the doors and placed one long, pale hand on the iron handle.

“Shall we?”

I stepped forward into the building, and nearly stopped in my tracks.

The interior was breathtaking.

The lobby soared high above me. Crystal chandeliers dangled from the vaulted ceiling like constellations, scattering fractured light across the room like falling stars. The red velvet carpet beneath my feet was so thick, so plush, it swallowed my footsteps. Even the sound of my breath seemed to vanish into it.

The walls were paneled in dark, polished wood, every inch lacquered to a mirror sheen. They reflected the chandeliers too well, too brightly. Almost unnaturally so. It hurt to look at them for too long, like the reflections weren’t bouncing back light, but echoing something deeper.

But that was only the beginning.

Because then… we stepped into the concert hall.

And the world changed.

It was massive. Far larger than the exterior of the building could possibly allow. The space seemed to stretch endlessly upward and outward. A grand cathedral of music carved out of dream and impossibility. Tiered balconies climbed the walls like layers of an ancient colosseum. Rows upon rows of empty seats spread out before me in perfect symmetry, all facing the stage with quiet reverence.

And at the center of that stage, alone and waiting, was the piano.

It was a full grand. Black lacquered. It gleamed like obsidian under the soft glow of the footlights. It sat there like the crown jewel of Dorset Hollow. Untouched, yet eternal. As if it had been waiting not just for *someone* to play it, but for *me*, specifically.

But, other than that, something about it felt familiar. The shape. The shine. The stillness. It wrapped around me like a memory I hadn’t made yet. Comforting, and yet deeply wrong. It stirred something in me I couldn’t name. A kind of ache. A quiet, terrible longing.

The hairs on my arms stood on end. My heart skipped a beat. And still, without thinking, I stepped toward it. Slowly.

“She’s a piece of beauty,” Wellers said behind me. “Specially made for this hall.”

I nodded slowly, still watching the piano. “She looks…” I paused, trying to find the right word. “Hungry.”

He let out a soft chuckle, but there was nothing warm in it. “Music’s always been a hungry thing. Same with memory. Takes what you give it. Sometimes more.”

I glanced back at him. “That sounds less like admiration and more like a warning.”

“Well, admiration and warning are often siblings. Beauty isn’t gentle just because it’s lovely. And music…” he trailed off for a moment, eyes on the stage. “Music remembers. Even when we don’t want it to.”

There was something in his voice. A heaviness. A certainty. Maybe even grief. Like he was mourning something that hadn’t happened yet, but would.

I turned to face him. “You sound like you’re giving a eulogy.”

“Do I?” he asked, tone still smooth, but now with something like a leer beneath it.

I blinked. Something about that response landed wrong.

“You… usually refer to yourself in the third person,” I said slowly. “But just this moment, you didn’t.”

He paused. Just for a heartbeat.

“Mr. Wellers finds it… easier that way. Keeps things separate.”

“Separate from what?” I asked.

“From before,” he replied, almost too quickly. “Before doors like these opened. Before others started walking through them.”

I raised an eyebrow. “And what happens once they do?”

His eyes drifted to the piano, then to the empty seats.

“They play. Sometimes once. Sometimes forever.”

I was about to press him on that, but he lifted a hand, gently steering the conversation elsewhere.

“You’ll have time to prepare,” he said. “The recital is tomorrow.”

“Why have one anyway? There's barely anyone in town.” I turned towards the empty rows of seats. But out of the corner of my eye, I saw something. A flash of color. A flicker of blue in the far corner of the front row. But the instant I looked directly at it, there was nothing there. Just empty seats.",7,1765132144.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,0.89,False

1pgphg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pgphg2/dream_walker/,Dream walker,"Dream, dreamer, dream for it is but a glimpse beyond mortality.

Ever since I was a kid, I could not recall the dreams that came forth to me whilst in nocturnal's sweet embrace. Later in life, my father would tell me tales of my bouts of night terrors, to which he claimed I would wake up screaming so loudly as to awaken the entire town of Carthridge. I recall the years of sleepless nights he spoke of, when I'd wake up on the brink of midnight in sweats, screaming my voice hoarse. Those nights, when I would remain in bed, afraid to fall asleep. I could not recall my nightmares, but the pit in my stomach taught me to fear sleep.

I recall the worst and final night of my night terrors. I had once more woken up my father to anguished screams. This time, he found me in bed, lying in my own blood. He looked me over and found many deep scratch marks running the length of my back. The wounds required stitches and were ultimately dismissed as self-inflicted due to my nightmares. They didn't come again after that night. Not for many years.

They are back now, and so I find myself waking throughout the night drenched in sweat. I haven't properly slept in many nights and find myself wearing down. I called my father, who recommended to me the sleep therapist who'd treated me as a kid after my incident.

I walked up the narrow staircase to her office. I knocked on the door, and it thumped as it was pushed against its frame before being pulled open. An older woman with messy, wild, white hair stood there, in a neat, pressed beige suit jacket and dress.

“Hi, I'm Dr.Zakrowsky. It's nice to meet you. Sorry about the door, I haven't had my coffee yet this morning.”

 She led me into the room, making her way around a large desk. It was a neat room with the exception of a black and silver robe that was splayed across a plain white couch. Despite the neat appearance of the room and her clothes. The dirt under her fingernails and messy appearance were all too distracting.  

“So how can I help you today?” She asked as I sat in a chair before her desk.

“Same thing we spoke on the phone about. My night terrors are back.”

“Ah, yes, and when's the last time you had these night terrors?”

“When I last came to see you, when I was ten. Don't you have my file?”

“We lost some files while digitalizing everything. I'd like to try a new solution I've been hearing about. It'll seem a little fringe, but I've heard nothing but great things. I'd like to take a herbalist approach to this solution. You see, some cultures believe that some herbs can ease the consumer into sleep, allowing them to have a more relaxed sleep, reducing the chances of night terrors, and that's what I was hoping we could try today.” 

When she finished speaking, she opened the top drawer of her desk and pulled out a small pouch of herbs.

“You can make it into a tea and drink it before going to bed. Anywho, that'll be it for today. I'll be in contact with you in a couple of days to see how everything's coming along.”I thanked her as she hurried me out the door.

When dusk came, light retreated, and night's darkness fell upon the town. I made the sweet-smelling tincture, which smelled of roses and rosemary. As it came to my tongue, I was met with a sweet, silky smooth taste that slid its way down my gullet, warming me from the inside. The effects were immediate, and I flopped loosely onto my bed, as though I had been drugged. I looked out my window and saw the snow gently falling. I sank into my bed like quicksand, slowly sinking deeper and deeper, until all light was cut off. In the void, I saw a ray of light, growing closer and closer. The ground spat me out, and I found myself lying on a soft, cold bed of snow in Carthridge's town square. The night sky was a black ever ever-expanding void, empty of any light. The only light around me came from the street lights. The town was still and silent, the only sound was the whistling wind rushing through the empty streets. I looked around for any sign of life, but found none.

Months have passed, and the snow has gone.  I've walked the streets, searched homes, only to find them empty. Entire homes and apartment complexes were hollowed out like husks as though they served as nothing more than set dressing. My apartment complex was the only building that was normal. My room was the same as it had always been. Although I could open none of the other doors in the building, no matter how hard I bashed into them, the cheap doors would not budge. One day, out of desperation, I walked along the highway out of Carthridge. I walk for hours only to end up walking straight back towards town as though the road had looped around. I've tried so many times, but I just end up walking right back into town.

Still, I remain, and I am alone for this place is devoid of all life. I feel as though I am the first star in the night sky, stuck in an empty void, isolated and so far removed from all existence. This oblivion I find myself trapped in is stuck in perpetual darkness. I often find myself reminiscing on the sun's light, missing its warmth upon my skin. I've given up all hope. I have tried so hard to escape, but there is no way out. I'm tired, so very tired, and I see no other way. I look at the interior of the decrepit shack I found myself in after my last escape attempt. I kick the chair out from underneath me and feel the rope constrict around my neck like a boa. It digs into my skin harshly as I thrash, gasping for air to no avail. I feel the veins in my eyes pop as an intense pressure grows in my head. My head is hot as though it is on fire, as all the blood pools in my face. I flail for hours until I am weak and all energy has been sapped from my body. Death does not come for me, and a single tear rolls down my cheek as the wind gently rocks my body back and forth. 

I believe many more months have passed since. Months in complete isolated silence, staring at the door that stands right before me. Time feels as though it has stood still, if not for the snow that has come once more, blanketing the outside in a powdery, glistening white. The harsh cold has penetrated me down to the bone. It wasn't long before the cold turned into a burning heat, and my body felt as though it had been enveloped in flames. I had long since given up when the crunching sound of footsteps in the snow. A man walked in, his skin was smooth and unblemished, his eyes were brilliant marvels of starlight. Our eyes met, and I was at once filled with the hope of freedom, but the hope was soon crushed when he turned and walked out the door, leaving me to hang. The crushing feeling had been worse than any before to be so close to freedom, to have it dangle before me, only to be torn away. Left to my own fate. Tears froze on my cheeks as they came. 

The wind picked up, and the cabin groaned loudly. Within the hour, a blizzard had set upon me, moving the shack with every gust. It proved to be too much for the tired, old roof, the weight of the snow and my own caused it to collapse, releasing me but trapping me under rubble. Air rushed into my gasping lungs, filling them with the burning, bitter cold air they'd gone so long without. I cried, tears running coolly down my cheeks as I moaned painfully, my voice frail and raspy. I was shocked at the sound of my own voice. A million pins and needles spread through my body like wildfire, filling me with excruciating pain as blood circulated once more. The rubble insulated me from the frigid cold, and my body began to thaw.

Days passed before I had thawed enough to move. I brought my hands slowly up to my face and strangely found no trace of frostbite. I inched forward ever so slightly. Day by day, my unused muscles were weak and nearly useless. The cold had relented, and so after many days, I stood like a newborn standing on his own two feet for the first time. I was freed, and I wobbled my way out on unsteady legs that shook like jello. The pain was blinding, but I pushed forth until I reached my apartment and made it to my room, where I wrapped myself in blankets and felt a comforting warmth for the first time in many, many months. I stayed in my apartment recovering patiently.

When I felt well enough to leave again, another month had passed. As I left my building, I was made aware of many tracks in the deep snow that went to my window before stopping. Many were hardly visible and had been there a while. One set was deeper. They went to my window like the rest, then in the direction of the woods. Desperate to find anyone who may know a way out, I followed them deep into the looming forest. It led all the way to a strange clearing. There was a tall, smooth stone in the middle. I lost all train of thought, my attention was drawn to it, and I walked over. I put my hand on its smooth surface, and it was warm and humming beneath its surface. The incessant wind stood still. For the first time since I arrived here, I looked up and saw a mass of writhing constellations, clusters of bright, beautiful colors dancing inside the mass as it opened its many nebulous eyes and looked down upon me. I heard the crashing of trees and, like thunder before lightning, the deafening roar of hundreds of thousands of voices screaming all at once.

A writhing mass of flesh, limbs, cloths, silks, and leathers. The inorganic matter melding with the organic. It came crashing forth from the tree line. Hundreds and thousands of people all melted into one. A hundred thousand heads, their eyes glowing with the incandescence of the stars. Their voices screaming, groaning and moaning all at once in perfect unison. It was making its way over to me fast. It slammed into trees, sending them careening every which way. I ran, but the snow was so deep my legs moved through it like tar. It was reaching me, and no matter how much I tried, I could hardly run fast enough to get away. I could hear it reaching me, it was not but twenty feet away when I tripped. Closer and closer. It set upon me now inches away as I screamed.

“MICKEY, MICKEY”

My father was standing over me, shaking me. 

“Jesus Christ, kid, you scared the fuck out of me.” He looked completely out of breath, fear-laden in his pale face.

“What's going on?” I asked in a daze

“No one's seen you in two days, Mickey. Your work called me asking if I'd seen you. You're not answering your phone, so I came here, and I find you screaming like a fucking banshee in your sleep. You scared the shit out of me, kiddo.” His body seemed to be at ease when he saw I was alright. 

“Probably just another nightmare. Can I go back to bed?” I replied dismissively 

“Yeah, sure, kiddo. I'll be downstairs when you wake back up.”

Although I don't know why, I have the deepest sense of dread, like I shouldn't, but I think I will just go back to sleep.",9,1765131961.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,0,1.0,False

Because of its vast walking and biking trails, parks, and kayaking down the Red Deer River that cuts through it, Red Deer is the most ""active city"" in Canada. But its larger and more sensational title — ""Highest Crime Rate of Any City in Canada"" — would technically and probably make it the most anti-Canadian city in Canada, if that’s something possible. Mostly property crimes and auto theft, over proportionate to the stereotypical violent crime we also have, but my dad wanted out of there just the same.

I don't remember this happening, but my dad says someone stole his car while I was still strapped in my carseat. The guy drove at high speeds on the ice for five minutes before noticing me in the rearview mirror. To the guy's credit, he immediately pulled over, parked, cranked the heat (it was -40°), and ran. When the RCMP caught him eventually, he said stealing a kid wasn’t shit he signed up for. My dad always warned me that it could have been so much worse, that it could have been someone else not so nice. But that was his final straw.

My father was the first and only city-boy in his large and poor immigrant family to buy land, and on top of that, land in the remote peaceful countryside away from any chaos. The property was sold at a great discounted price, the only reason such a dream could be possible. The neighbor who sold it to us, Lucas Thompson, his mean father used to own our homestead. But after Mr. Thompson's father got drunk and attacked a coyote with his bare hands, it bit him and gave him something apparently similar to rabies, then he died. Mr. Thompson told us to never go near the coyotes or any of the animals within the property limits, but they're everywhere and it's never been an issue.

The homestead my dad bought and rebuilt — Coyote Ridge Ranch — was a 15 mile (or 24 kilometer) drive outside Red Deer. Alberta is miserable for most of the year, but driving home during the summertime is something I cherish. Once you escaped the confines of city limits, you soared past rolling hills of vibrantly yellow canola fields, broken up by spits of white quaking aspen and spruce forest (the trees too reedy for a proper tree-fort, unfortunately). At the end of your 15 mile cruise, you’d turn off Range Road 260 onto a single lane gravel road that stretched 3 miles. That was the place I was privileged to call home.

My earliest memory wasn't a car heist. My earliest memory was my father taking me into the woods one summer night as a four-year-old, gently shushing me, and pointing up. Above, clinging to a high tree limb, was a massive porcupine, the same one that we think later put a dozen quills into the muzzle of one of our dogs, Cocoa. That was just the beginning of my obsession with animals. Most of my memories formed in the summer. There was the tiny fawn I found in the tall grass, hiding with its head down and eyes closed until I passed. Or the foxes I would chase on my bike until I lost sight of them in the trees. Or the prairie dogs that always darted across the gravel as we drove up, and ducked down in the fields — though I haven’t seen one in almost fifteen years. My dad swore up and down he hadn’t drowned out a prairie dog from its tunnel since he was at least a teenager, when he used to trespass with his friends and pine over this area.

Dad never seemed protective of any wild animals, but his enthusiasm for birds was an exception. He was elated when I woke him up to tell him there was a nest of barn swallows outside my window. He was even more excited when a **ruby-throated hummingbird** hit our large living room window — he gently put the hummingbird in my hand while we waited for it to fly away again. My dad constantly pointed out yellow-warblers and Bohemian-wax-wings to me from the front porch, his binoculars and thumbed-through bird books always on the coffee table. Even when bird shit started to cake the porch because of the barn swallow’s nest, he wouldn’t let anyone touch them or move it. *“Took a lot of work for them to build, kid. They’re so cheerful with their chirps every morning, can't lose 'em.”* As much as my dad liked birds, I never liked our chickens. There were too many thoughts behind their eyes.

I had very few friends, only the animals. I chased away my older male cousins by becoming hysterical every time they shot a frog or bird with their pellet guns. The few friends I did have as a child, a couple sons of a few neighbors, stopped coming over once my father had his big falling-out with their parents. I hear one friend moved to big city Calgary and one moved to big city Edmonton when they grew up. It seems no one thought to stay here in Red Deer.

Despite the crime of the city we’d moved away from, my father never locked our doors. He always said *“If anyone’s ever gone so far out of their way to break into our house in the middle of the country, glass doors won’t stop them. Might as well let them take what they want, then have broken windows and doors and still lose our stuff anyway.”* When I asked him what would happen if we were home when someone broke in, he said *“That’s what dads and baseball bats under the bed are for.”* When I asked what would happen if it were ever just *me* home alone and someone tried to break in, he said *“Superman will always be here to protect you.”*

Ultimately, my childhood is what inspired me to also move away like my lost friends, to chase a doctorate in Zoology from the University of Florida. Before I moved, in my home-schooled isolation from any peers my age, I struggled to feel like a real Canadian; an identity crisis that increased as I became comfortable and acclimated to living in the United States. But I still told myself I felt like a proud Albertan, because the land itself was and would always be my home. The dirt just somehow smelled different. The sage and wildflowers were different. How the trees and grass and bugs rustled every night as the sun set was somehow different. I could tell it was, I listened. I didn’t know much about Canadian politics or music or history, or even much of the Metric system anymore. But I could tell you everything about how Alberta’s geology and paleontology was unique. Maybe I’d even lost the accent, but no one could take from me what was inside me. Maybe my dad didn’t always feel like he’d earned his spot as a real Canadian, but I would’t be him.

Every year that I come home to visit, I see the city expand more and more. The drive into town changed from a thirty minute drive to twenty-five. I feel a deep anxiety that someday the concrete expanse of Red Deer will overtake my peaceful shelter, which wasn’t helped by my own father’s push when I was a child to subdivide his own acreage. The neighbors, who shared a similar sentiment to mine, fought my father tooth and nail to preserve the sanctity of this cut of countryside and never bring in more strangers. They were real ranchers. My father was an outsider who tried to sneak in. Even with our neighbors a minimum of kilometers away, it was still somehow possible to feel even more alone.

There is some fraud to the picture I’m painting. Yes, we lived on an isolated homestead, but my father wasn’t running other men’s horses or ‘Berta beef cattle on our property for the sake of his livelihood like traditional Albertan ranchers, the yearly payment per head was menial. This lifestyle was a hobby to him, an appearance he enjoyed finally proving to his family he’d earned. But he’d drive into the city everyday and work like everyone else there. Maybe I’m a fraud too. Maybe I’m not really a rugged Canadian, maybe I’m really no one. Maybe I went to Florida to prove I’m an animal person, maybe I moved to the states to be the only Canadian in the room. Because when a second one shows up, suddenly the cracks in my story show.

Sometimes life out here with animals could be unsettling to a young child, though. Like the time I found deep footprints beside our stock pond, moose prints so large in the mud I thought at first glance they were made by grizzly paws. Nothing to a frost-bitten Canadian beats a grizzly bear in fear factor like an angry, horny bull moose.

Or, the time our barn cat, Herbie, her litter of newborn kittens suddenly completely vanished.

Or, the time I woke up in the middle of the night, startled, from the sudden ear piercing shriek of a dozen coyotes all at once right outside my window. The medley of howling was so close and so intense, it sounded like they were only on the other side of the glass. And as soon as the howling abruptly started — once I sat upright — it immediately and unnaturally stopped. As if it had never been there at all, as if I had only dreamt it in the last few seconds of sleep. I stayed awake and frozen, listening, panting in the stuffiness of my room. Then — now focused on the eerie silence, on the uncanny absence of yipping — a new noise came. It was faint, a faint crunch of gravel down the slope of our driveway. Something was walking up the drive, slowly and methodically. But it wasn’t a pack of scurrying animals. It was only one set of footsteps, staggering each lurch with a heavy pause. *Crunch.* Silence. *Crunch.* Silence. *Crunch.* Up the gravel towards the house, towards my window.

There was only once in my life I ever intentionally hurt an animal.

But I always thought, no matter the risks of rugged life out here (like the mother moose I surprised while picking wild raspberries and saskatoons in the deep brush, or the young bull that escaped from its pen and charged at me), any of it was safer than life in the city. As much danger large animals can be to people, *people would always be more dangerous than animals.*

I had taken a few weeks off this summer from my masters thesis research — studying the egg-laying habits of strawberry poison dart frogs — to see my dad. He waited until I was in the Jeep with him at arrivals to tell me that we wouldn’t really be camping again in a remote corner of the Yukon Territories after all. Dad was ill, very ill. It was an odd form of cancer that had rapidly developed in his throat and tonsils. But thankfully, despite the normal snail-pace of Canadian healthcare, he was being put through surgery extremely quickly. He'd already had so many appointments before I came that the preliminary work was over. Dad wouldn’t let me tell anyone in the family that he was sick, it just wasn’t the family’s culture. Out of embarrassment, Grandpa stopped going to church when he found out the congregation was praying for his colon cancer, and my dad wasn’t much better. Dad was determined to always be my invincible superman.

I asked him if I could come to the hospital with him in Calgary, to support him. But Dad each time said *“No thank you, Pearl.”* My dad didn’t want me to see him in pain, or struggling, or unable to talk or use his tongue in the immediate aftermath of the surgery. He said all he wanted was to be able to come home to me when he’d regained himself. All he needed to recover was the rare treat of being in my company, to sit on the couch with me, drink Prosecco, and watch our old shows together like *F Troop* and *Hogan’s Heroes*.

Once we parked in front of the house and I got out, I noticed a sizable dent in the front of his Jeep. But when I inquired about it, he acted like I hadn't asked.

Surgery on his throat was early the next morning, an hour and a half drive. That evening, I watched as he drove away in his old Wrangler Jeep, gravel kicking up behind him in a cloud of dust. I tried not to cry while still in his view, but at least he could see how much I cared. Before my dad got in his Jeep, he put a tender hand on my shoulder and looked deep in my eyes. A soulful, whispy quality in him I hadn't seen in a long time. *""Pearl, you have no idea what it means that you're here again. I can overcome anything I'm hit with, knowing I have you to come home to. You can 'mind over matter' anything.""*

Coming back to Alberta always felt like some sort of arrested development. I am a woman, but all the same, why was the idea of being home alone overnight here so hard? In Florida, I was an accomplished and independent student living in my own dorm. Hell, I’d already done an internship in Costa Rica, and I’d be doing a field research trip in Kenya in a few years to study strange African amphibians like caecilians for my doctorate thesis (I’d almost studied **Albertan tiger salamanders** for my masters thesis, but chose something more exotic and exciting). But coming home, I struggle to even pick out my own food at the grocery store. *What’s wrong with me?* But maybe that revert to childlikeness was a good thing, like a constant source of comfort I was still tapping into. The day I don’t turn up that long 3 mile drive off Range Road 260 to get home is the day something deep inside me will die. *But all those strange noises at night by myself, in the middle of nowhere…*

Once Dad was gone, I sat on the porch watching where he'd disappeared to, and drank more than half a bottle of flavored rum, like the white-trash Florida woman I’d become. Immediately, I realized it was a mistake. Normally, getting a little blitzed loosened me up, made me soft and giggly, and put me to bed. But instead, I was abnormally paranoid. Every creak and rustle around me on the porch felt like a hidden peril. Maybe I should have drank the Prosecco instead.

Like it bothered me how the cows were acting. Their grazing pasture encircled half the property, only 20 feet from the house. In the morning, they’d walk together in a single file line, all at their own individual pace with their own gestures. In my opinion, watching them was the best way to start the day with a cup of tea. But once my dad drove off, now all the beef cows gathered along the fence, standing side by side and staring at me, silent. No moos. No flicking of their ears, no swatting their heads and necks at bugs. After a few minutes of all watching me, all at once, they turned and walked off, dispersing into the hills of their field and disappearing from sight.

It also bothered me that the cat food bowl I’d filled earlier was still full. Herbie had long since disappeared, but one of her surviving kittens, Fluffy, had somehow managed to stick around. Dad hadn’t seen her in days, but he said her food bowl at least was always partially eaten or empty by sundown. I knew death was always a possibility for the cats, now down to only one. I hated that my dad wouldn’t get them fixed or keep them inside. Momma barn cats having inbred litters over and over again every summer was so hard on their little bodies, coyotes would always get them eventually, and outdoor cats kill billions of birds every year. But my dad cared about paying for people more than he cared about paying for animals, and didn’t see the need in interfering. *“Live and let live,”* he’d say. He never trained the dogs to do tricks, or put collars on them, he thought it was disrespectful. They stayed outside, he stayed inside. You know where I was.

I checked my phone, I was down to five percent. I got up, warm and wobbly from the rum, and wandered down the steps to Dad’s beat-up sedan. I’d taken my charger earlier when I ran to the grocery store before he left with his Jeep. I hadn’t bothered to put my shoes back on, and I was grateful my barefeet could still tolerate gravel. My entire childhood, I’d run up and down that steep drive with no shoes. The trick to remember is that pain from jagged gravel is dull and predicable, but the pain of surprise thistle in soft grass isn’t.

I pulled the heavy handle. *“Shit.”*

There were his keys on the dash. My dumbass forgot his car was old, annoyingly and defiantly old, and for some inexplicable reason, it locks automatically if you leave the fob inside. I could have sworn I had the fob securely in my pocket when I climbed out.

*“Fuck you, Pearl. Fuck my life.”*

I rubbed my eyes. Stupidly, my disappointment first and foremost was that I couldn’t listen to a podcast as I fell asleep that night (and anxiety from my dad’s grumpiness when he'd learned I’d locked us out of the car again). But then the greater importance of not having a cell phone in case of an emergency hit me. Now, not only was I alone, but I had no way to drive away or call for help if something happened. *Idiot.* I grabbed a wire hanger from inside and tried to fiddle with the door, but in my inebriated state it was no use. I went inside, searched my dad’s bedroom and office, none of his chargers fit my older phone model. While I was shuffling through his things, I found a contract my dad had signed to authorize oil drilling on the property again. He was going to make a lot of money if it went through. *Why hadn't he told me?*

I tried each car door one more time, no luck. I checked my phone, down to four percent. I fumbled with it and switched to airplane mode to preserve battery. I looked up around the property, feeling exposed to no longer be on the porch with the house to my back. *Damn, I miss having dogs.* Once Cocoa and Hershey died, my dad didn’t want new puppies. Maybe it was for the best, but I would have rather not felt so alone in that moment. Frustrated, I drank more, hoping this unease would dissipate. But the more I dulled my senses, the more I felt like I was in imminent danger.

I didn’t know how much longer I could stand being outside at all. There was an overwhelming odor of chicken manure. Chicken shit smells so different and so much worse than cow shit, I’d never managed to get used to that stench. But Dad hadn’t bought any new chickens in years, the coop was still falling apart. No matter where the wind blew from, or no wind at all, the smell was inescapable. I got up, antsy, and inside I microwaved up a bowl of instant pesto pasta. When I came back outside, thankfully the chicken manure smell was gone, and I could eat in some shamble of peace.

The sun was finally setting. Then, there was a strange buzzing outside, in the distance. It was a long unbroken note at first, then overtime it broke up, un-rhythmically, like someone or something *panting*. But the deep, droning, buzzing quality didn’t change. Then the panting in the distance turned into a yakking, past the hills, like something was violently throwing up.

I got up, my heart skidding. More than that, I was annoyed it was skidding. Why couldn’t I just enjoy this beautiful place? I went inside again and slammed the door, too stubborn to entertain this panic. I wanted to keep the house ventilated with the two screen doors, but the noise was so much, I closed all the doors and windows. I checked my phone, three percent. *Why would you think this is an emergency? Is it 911 in Canada too, or is it 999 like the British? Of course it's 911.* I couldn’t think straight at this point, the house was getting so warm. As it got darker outside, I couldn’t tell if what I was seeing were eyes outside, or lights from the house distorted in the glass reflections. I felt bloated, like I was being pumped with hot air. It was so sudden, it felt like I was becoming a sausage. *Why did I drink this much?*

I then felt a sudden unearthly tiredness that overcame me. I was too sleepy and stumbling to even make it to my old bedroom. I laid out on the couch and crashed, hard. I don't remember what I dreamt about, but it smelled of decay. And our two dogs were there, Cocoa and Hershey. They were black labs mixed with blue heeler, adopted the day we moved onto this property when I was a toddler. I’d known them my whole life until I was twelve. 

I miss those two dogs so damn much. I miss the sweet grey in their faces as they aged with me. I miss taking moonlit walks with them through the path in the trees. My dad never wanted me to go outside at night, he was afraid of the coyotes. He was afraid I’d be too small to take them on. But Cocoa and Hershey always walked side by side with me, and I was never afraid. Sometimes the cries of the coyotes would loom over us in the distance, but they did not fear the noise.

I dream of them often. But I never dream of Honey.

Honey was a cousin or something to Cocoa and Hershey, I don't know how, but she was bred by the same neighbor, Jake Duke on the north side of the property. A late addition to our little family. Honey was an inbred golden lab mix, her parents were siblings. Honey never acted quite right. Cocoa and Hershey, untrained but perfect as they were, always trailed behind us in a single-file line when we went on family walks, the cats and trusting chickens following close behind the two dogs in turn. But Honey would stop and squat to take a shit right in front of you on the path, oblivious you’d walk straight into it. 

Hershey once brought home a dying baby bunny in her mouth that she found, gentle and maternal, giving it to me to take care of (it died anyway). Sometimes Hershey would borrow a kitten from Herbie’s nursing litter so she could also be a mom for a little bit, grooming and cuddling the kitten in the warm grass. Hershey always brought the kitten back, and Herbie always trusted her. Cocoa once nearly gave his life protecting the free roaming chickens from a red fox. They truly were our family. But Honey wasn’t like that. Something wasn’t right with Honey.

Things came to a breaking point when Honey attacked one of the ducks in the pond. She shook it to pieces in her mouth, blood and organs and feathers everywhere. While Honey was mauling this duck, Cocoa and Hershey were rounding up the other ducks and ducklings like the precious discount sheepdogs they were. My dad wouldn’t tolerate this, he couldn’t trust Honey anymore, my protests didn't matter. *""What if Honey attacked you, too? Would your tiny hands and fingers be able to push her off?""*

And my dad wouldn’t give her up to the pound so another unsuspecting family would have to deal with her. So, my dad took her up the hill in the forest, shotgun in hand, and once out of sight, but not out of earshot from me, he put a bullet between her eyes. Dad said a dog knows when you’re going to shoot it. Apparently she fought the rope every step up the hill.

When I woke up on the couch, it was so hot, I brushed off my gut feeling that I'd been watched through the large living room windows while I slept. I panicked and thought the furnace had automatically kicked on or something, but it hadn't. I got up and looked for a box fan, I'd be pissed if my dad had thrown it out. I was shocked I was still as drunk as I was before. When I passed his computer again to go for his office closet, I realized I might still be able to reach people after all. I could text the neighbors from his desktop. His password was still my name.

When I logged into his computer, I was startled. Deeply startled. My dad had been on reddit (not the scary part). On a new account, he'd posted a gory photo of his Jeep's fender dent, covered in blood, with a decapitated coyote on the side of the road. He'd uploaded it *weeks* ago, but he still had it open, as if he'd just posted it. There were a lot of comments. None answering his question. Maybe he was still checking for an answer.

*""I was angry something fell through last night. I had a few, saw this on the road, and swerved to hit it. Yeah, I'm an asshole. Not my finest moment. Any advice how I can get this dent out? It's not coming out no matter what I do.""*

The coyote had been hit in the throat, its neck torn open, head hanging back limply.

*Why would he post this? This is unspeakable.* *He could have driven away and washed the blood off first. Why show the coyote? Why did he have to take a picture in that moment? Has my dad lost his mind?*

I closed the internet browser and went to his messages. The most recent text was a reminder from my dad's doctor for his scheduled appointment tomorrow morning, he'd replied ""CONFIRM,"" as he had to every other appointment reminder before. I typed the name of our closest neighbor, Lucas Thompson, in the text search bar. Then I paused again.

My dad's last message to Lucas Thompson: *""Please buy it back. I'll take anything. I need to get off this property. I'm sorry I didn't believe you. Tell me more about what happened to your dad.""*

Lucas Thompson: *""It’s too late. We all tried to warn you.""*

My dad: *""I'm not doing the oil drilling anymore. It wouldn't let us. Please call me.""*

I checked the paperwork on my dad's desk again. I hadn't read the contract properly the first time, I was too distracted. The contract authorizing oil drilling had actually been *canceled*. I thumbed through the contract, constantly losing my place from how my fingers shook. The ""Act of God"" clause of the contract was circled in yellow highlighter. Handwriting (that wasn't my father's) scribbled ""Reference incident report and 'Act of God' contractual reason for cancellation."" *What incident?* I couldn't find the incident report for the longest time. *Something about great bodily harm to the surveyor, but all these words are blurring together.*

I started to drunkenly text Lucas Thompson through the computer. It was as slurred as I was, full of typos. I had to start over a few times.

*""Lukas, this is earl. Perl. im here al one. can u chack onme""*

I hit send, then got up. At this point, I was too warm to function or process this more. A thick mucusy sweat was dripping down and rubbing between my fingers.

I was too hazy to notice that Mr. Lucas immediately texted back: *""You didn't deserve this.""*

I got up and searched through my dad's closet top and bottom, sloppily knocking everything over onto myself. Nothing. No fan. I was so hot I thought I'd die. But something told me to not open any windows. The humming and yakking outside wasn’t going away. It's not just that, I noticed something else — the chirp of the insects and symphony of frogs outside, muted through the walls, would stop and start again. Start and stop. Start and stop. As if I was plugging my ears and taking my fingers out over and over. It was everywhere. And it was just getting *louder*.

I went to the bathroom and flushed my face with cold tap water. It smelled foul, the well water always smells foul. Something to root me to reality. I gripped the sides of the sink. Outside, in the forest, the rumble and crack of a tree falling befuddled me, like a factory reset to my mind. In my entire life on Coyote Ridge Ranch, I had never heard a tree fall.

Then a second tree fell.

*“What’s coming?”*

I checked my phone. Two percent. *What would I even tell the cops?* Then I looked up from the sink to the dirty smudged mirror. I dropped my phone, and it cracked on the tile floor. I rubbed my eyes. My mouth had grown wider, impossibly so, my lips thinning and stretched. My eyes much smaller, and drifting apart like continents. I wiped the mirror clean, but the reality was only worse. When I’d look at my eyes, it looked like my mouth was growing. When I stared at my mouth, it was my eyes that were still changing. Like trying to track a floater in the corner of your vision, you swear you’re noticing something, but as soon as you focus on it, it darts away. My nose was sinking into my skin. I swear I wouldn’t miss that.

I left the bathroom, stumbling as I scooped my phone back up. Still two percent. The house was impossibly stuffy, like the air was encasing me in a dry pressurized tomb. I desperately just wanted to open a screened door, I just wanted a breath of fresh air to think clearly. But my hearing was still overwhelmed. The unrhythmic droning (and coughing) was so loud, the staggered insects and frogs were so enveloping, my senses were entirely overstimulated. I went upstairs to the bonus room, sloppily, falling on my face a few times as I climbed. I ran to the back of the room, moonlight streaming through the small single window, and I propped it open with a book. As soon as the window slid up and hit the top, the barrage of noises outside stopped.

I didn't care. I breathed in the fresh air with my wide open mouth against the window screen, grateful to feel the wind on my tongue. I paused, and held my breath. Outside below me was the whining of a frail newborn kitten. A single one. It was soft, hungry, barely a sigh.

Despite my heat exhaustion, I felt my sweat run cold.

*Don’t go outside.*

*It’s trying to make you go outside.*

My movements weren’t frantic and sporadic anymore. Calculated and cautioned, but still wobbly, I pulled a flashlight from a drawer, and slowly lifted it to the screen of the window. Nothing.

My chest hurt. Everything hurt. The acidic ballooning in my stomach and igneous constricting of my esophagus was only worse. This must have been the worst panic attack I’d ever experienced in my life because the physical toll was unbearable. Some how, impossibly, I wasn’t sobering up. I was getting drunker.

My fingers fumbling with the screen, I slide my phone off airplane mode, ready to finally call someone, anyone. I couldn't justify toughing through this anymore. I couldn't be stoic like my dad.

The phone died in my hands. I held down all the buttons to power it back on, hoping for any semblance of a second chance. Probably in vain, but maybe it had just crashed, it was an old model, it crashed all the time. It was still at two percent.

Overwhelmed, I gripped my knees, and started vomiting. My vision was blacking in and out, I couldn’t see where I’d blown chunks, but some of it hit my bare legs. As I stood back up, swaying, I was perplexed. I felt so hot and corrosive inside. But whatever was coating my legs was ice cold. My vision still spotting, I swiped my hand on my leg and smelled it. It didn’t smell like bile and stomach acid and pesto. It smelled like dead fish.

*“Alright, time to kill yourself Pearl.”*

I gripped the windowsill, trying to swallow a deep and helpless cry. Then paused. I was snapped out of my internal misery. My dad was outside, standing in the high grass of the open field, shrouded by the halo of moonlight at his back. I couldn't tell if he was staring straight ahead into the void or directly up at me.

I lifted the flashlight to the window screen a second time, then immediately dropped it, no, *threw* it away. The moment my flashlight crossed his body, that's when I chucked it. *That is my father outside. But something is very, very wrong.* His mouth wasn't open, but it came down to his stomach, I don't know how to describe it, I didn't look at it long enough, I *wouldn't* look at it long enough. Ruby red blood ran down from under his chin, soaking his entire neck, like any skin past his ears had been flayed.

His eyes.

Something was wrong with his eyes. They weren't bloodshot, but they were flat, bulbous, and orange.

That's all I saw before I slammed the window shut. I sank to the floor, my back to the wall. I had to stay quiet. My tongue felt so large in my mouth, I couldn't gasp even if I wanted to.

*DING!* I jumped out of my skin.

Miraculously, my phone turned back on. One percent. I had a new text from several hours ago, one of the neighbors who doesn't speak to us.

JAKE DUKE (NORTH SIDE): *""I saw your dad crashed his Jeep at the property line. I'm sorry.""*

I frantically typed: *""Hwat? hes hear! Helpm!""*

No response. I sent more.

*""Somethng,s happeggg! Whats happenigg? wh Y?”*

He texted back immediately.

JAKE DUKE (NORTH SIDE): *""It was probably Honey.""*

As I dialed “911,” it died. For good.

*I need water. I need water on my skin, or I’ll die.*

But when I ran back downstairs to the bathroom, the minerals in the well water burned my skin. I didn't care. I needed it so bad. Then, the water stopped running from the facet.

I had no choice.

I burst through the front door and ran into the night, toward the stock ponds. I tripped on the porch and fell on my face, it loosened my teeth but I didn't care, I kept going. I didn't care about the noises coming from behind me in the tall grass, or the yacking hum and drone that had come back, or the overwhelming stench of chicken shit; nothing mattered to me more than this thirst in my skin. But when the water came into view, I didn't take another step.

The large pond was still full of water, but the small stock pond had dried up. In the center of the empty pond, the normal corpses of my dad — and *me* — were lying, bloated, being consumed by hordes of red ants.

My throat felt so cold and dry, I could barely croak.

""That's not me, I'm still here.""

There was a third body sunk deeper in the fresh mud, much farther in decomposition than ours. Though, it looked barely human — at first, I thought I was looking at the corpse of a **maned wolf**. His arms and legs were char black, they'd been mutilated and extended. His bones jutted back and fanned from his spine, and orange fungus erupted from his skin. He had the same cleft palate that runs in Lucas Thompson's family.

I was slammed to my back, and dragged. The peaceful quilt of unpolluted stars passed above me in a blur. I screamed and twisted my body, frantic to break free from whatever had once been my dad. But the grip on my ankle and the swiftness I was dragged through the high grass was inescapable. I felt a fiery, chemical burning, like every plant irritant I touched absorbed into my skin and pumped through my system.

My shirt was catching on the thistles and brambles dragged under me, the naked skin of my back scraping like hell. I grabbed at the grass, desperate to stop wherever we were going, desperate to fight whatever was coming.

When I was forcefully pulled through a wild Alberta-rose bush, there was a new, horrific sensation. My arms and legs caught on the thorns, and I could feel large portions of my skin slopping off my body. I screamed even louder. The lower dermis on my arms and legs were exposed, like I was a peach being blanched. When that fell away, my muscles underneath were left open, dragging bare in the dust and rocks. The long, unbroken shriek that left my lungs felt inhuman — but still inaudible over the humming that might split my head open, coming from whatever became of my dad. But even in darkness under the moon, the color wasn’t right. My muscles weren't pulpy pink and red, my flesh under my skin was black and puss yellow. I involuntarily swallowed some of my teeth as they fell from my gums and rolled around my mouth like butterscotches. I vomited again as my head thrashed back and forth. I spewed mucusy wads of viscus leeches all over my chest. They attached themselves to my exposed flesh, and swiftly burrowed winding trenches through open muscle as they ate me alive.

*I said I've only ever hurt an animal, on purpose, one time...*

Once, I *did* push one of the cats off the roof. I heard they’d always land on their feet, so I wanted to see it. The cat was fine, as far as I know. I wasn't *trying* to hurt Herbie. Once, I did accidentally tear the wings off a dragonfly when I tried catching it in my hands — though it seems it got even, because an hour later I was attacked by a swarm of wasps and sent to the hospital in anaphylactic shock. Once, one of the baby birds outside my window stopped eating, so I took it from its nest and forced food into its mouth with a tube. But I fed it too much, its little lungs aspirated, it choked in my hands and died. The next day all the baby birds were gone. They weren’t old enough to fly away.

Once or twice, I did dissect a dead frog and a dead tiger salamander I found floating in the pond. I was so fascinated by their anatomy, I fell in love with amphibians.

*But once... Only one time... I can remember when I was eleven, I became fixated on how cool I thought ducks were* — *the webbing in their feet and the delicate feathers in their wings. I wanted so badly to dissect one* *and see the tendons in their wings. One of the ducklings was sick. I checked on it everyday, but it wouldn’t die fast enough…*

The rotting skin of my dad's arms and back were scabbing and crumbling into a flaky and vivid gangrene. My dad's long hanging mouth and open bleeding throat fused into a single fleshy and narrow mandible, his teeth detached and flowing down from his jaw and jutting out both sides like a serrated beak. His arms, they weren't just growing, both arms were *fraying* apart — like stick cheese being pulled five ways at the base and curled down. Each finger split apart from his hand, each peeling back individual tendons, separating muscle. It bisected and splintered his bones, he cried out as the sponge and viscera of his bone marrow leaked out in a pulpy grey and purple mass. What his arms were now fanned and folded, like wings.

*Well, I was so afraid to get in trouble with my dad, that once I was finished, I put the dissected duck in Honey’s mouth.*

*That night, the coyotes came and woke me, and the quiet footsteps approached.*

*The next year, Cocoa and Hershey were both hit by two different drunk drivers.*

I was dragged into the murky pond water. My dad seized me by my throat with what remained of his hands, and shook me up and down under the water, callously drowning me. Water and slimy algae flooded my throat and my lungs. I clawed at his face, unrecognizable from the man who I loved most, the man who always swore to protect me. Hornwort weed entangled around my wet slippery fingers as I tried to push him off. But my fingers weren’t mine anymore. None of this was mine.

While I thrashed and fought blindly and terrifyingly for my life, my mind began to slow down and disassociate. His humming drone was finally muted with my ears underwater. My internal voice felt cold and echoey — like thought was unnecessary to the outcome of my circumstance. Or maybe that thought wasn’t a part of me anymore.

*How do these perfectly working little ecosystems spring up?* I thought in academic detachment. *My dad filled these ponds himself with a pump and a hose, but they’ve got leeches, tiger salamanders, water bugs, and cat tails all on their own. As if they were always here.*

With his mouth, my father sliced my abdomen open. Where my ovaries should have been, fish eggs spilled out. But they weren’t fish eggs, there were tiny salamanders wriggling and squirming inside.

The voice in my mind went quieter and quieter, drifting far away from my reach. Until I could barely hear it at all:

Advice on how to communicate with him? If you understand his side, maybe help explain it to me? Maybe I’m explaining my side badly? I really don’t want to end the relationship if I can help it. 

Context: 

Me [23F, Autistic and ADHD] and my bf [23M, Neurotypical] have been dating for 1.5 years. We’re long distance (5 hour drive) and alternate who makes the trip about every 2 weeks. He works a 9-5 office job, and I work about 30 hours a week and also do 15 credit hours at University. 

I have level 2 Autism, with specific difficulty in the repetitive, rigid behavior area. I get overstimulated very easily and can’t handle crowded areas. I’m very introverted and need a lot of time alone on a daily basis. 

We recently took a 1-week international trip together and he was so excited to go see and do things, as was I. By the time his eyes opened, he was high energy, couldn’t sit still. But I needed a slow start to feel grounded before I was ready to jump into the excitement.

I didn’t see a problem with this, and told him he was free to wake up as early as he wanted and go experience things alone while I had my slow morning (which I said calmly, without any resentment). He did not take this well. He wanted me to be by his side 24/7, pictured us spending the whole time together. We tried to compromise and have allotted time for each of our preferences together, but 10 minutes into me savoring my coffee, he would start getting antsy and begin complaining that he’s bored. When I told him he didn’t have to stay with me, he got upset again, saying he was insecure I didn’t like him. It really ruined my experience. 

Because he was constantly glued to my side, I ended up waking up at like 5am and going to bed past midnight just to have some quiet, unperceived time. I felt so overstimulated and was holding a meltdown at bay the entire trip. I was irritable towards him but no matter how much I tried, he expressed how insecure he felt every time I requested alone time. 

He’s always been very calm and understanding throughout our relationship and a wonderful boyfriend (although he hasn’t personally tried to learn about autism). So this just felt like a rough time for us. 

We sat down to talk after the trip, and I established a boundary. I wanted at least 1 hour each morning of alone time where we don’t interact. Needless to say, he disliked this. His expectations for our relationship include us waking up together, happily. But I’m just not that person. We’re now on a 2 week break (no-contact) and after, we’ll talk. He said “I don’t want you to change for me, I want you to be who you are, but I don’t know if your alone time in the morning works for me. So please see if that’s something you’re willing to change.” 

I don’t really know what to do. I don’t really have many friends, am painfully lonely, not the greatest self-esteem, and he’s the first boyfriend I’ve had that is genuinely a good guy. However, I realize it’s hurting me to try to be someone I’m not. I don’t understand why it’s such a big deal for me to have my alone time in the morning, but it is for him. I am prepared to end the relationship if I can’t have alone time, but man it hurts. I’m so scared it’ll throw me into another depressive episode, and I just got out of the last one.

I am a 19 year old girl with PCOS. I was diagnosed around two years ago.
Back when I was diagnosed, I didn't take it too seriously and continued with my usual lifestyle. As time went by, my period almost never came, my ovulations hurt and my periods hurt like hell. I had crazy acne and was gaining weight just by breathing, also I had hair where I definitely shouldn't have. At 19 years old I was 85kg (187lbs) big which is honestly insane given the fact that I am 165cm tall (5'4).

Then I went to see a very specific doctor.

This doctor is a doctor which takes a holistic approach when it comes to any illness. I came to him with concerns about my hormones. Back when I got my first blood panel, my testosterone was crazy high. After the procedure he did during the exam, which is quite specific (I'll explain in the comments if anyone shall wonder). He came to a conclusion.

He told me to stop eating sugar, honey, white flour and some other things (also most of the processed foods) such as potatoes, chestnuts, corn etc. for 6 months straight, claiming that my cysts will disappear.

The exam was on October 17 this year. Since then I have lost 7kg (15lbs). Getting used to the new diet was rough the first few days, but now I can't imagine eating fast food and sweets without feeling nauseous after them. 

I feel so grateful and happy. My period came right on time, it was light flow and painless. I am now on 1.5 months out of the 6 and I can't wait to see what else this diet has in store for me! I have also started drinking Mushroom coffee instead of the normal one and lactose free milk. I am always awake, happy and full of energy!

I hope this will help someone who struggles with the same problems.
Any questions are welcome!

the that i like are vampire blood by bath and body works (i know it has jasmine… it’s not my top favorite but i’d use it anyway) and pure seduction untamed by victoria’s secret. 

i’ve been trying to chase the victoria’s secret high but have been very unsuccessful. the only perfume i’ve consistently used is ysl black opium, because i love the coffee notes with vanilla.

either scents are too sweet or too overpowering. i’ve asked at the stores for recommendations but they’ve always smelled more artificial or too strongly of something.

i love vanilla, fruity, plum-strawberry-cherry notes but if it’s mellowed out with something “darker” or more mature. and a natural ish scent too, nothing abnormally strong, but perfectly balanced. 

i want to smell like ordering black coffee and getting a croissant on the side. or even eating tiramisu in a plague doctor costume. ",4,1765131432.0,Perfumes,5,1.0,False
