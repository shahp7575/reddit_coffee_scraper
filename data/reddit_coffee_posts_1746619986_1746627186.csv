 ## Key Features Analysis

The quality of a cortado cup depends on its material, size, design, and insulation properties. The following features play a crucial role in the coffee-drinking experience.

**Capacity and Dimensions:** A traditional cortado typically contains around 4 ounces (120 ml) of liquid, encompassing the double shot of espresso and the milk. Therefore, the ideal cup should comfortably hold this volume without being overly large. External dimensions are also essential, ensuring the cup fits well in your hand and under espresso machine spouts.

A well-proportioned cortado cup promotes the beverage's intended balance and enhances the visual appeal. Cups that are too large dilute the flavors, while those that are too small can lead to spills and an unsatisfying experience. The overall height and width contribute to the cup's stability and ease of handling.

**Material Composition:** Porcelain, ceramic, and glass are the most common materials used for cortado cups. Porcelain is known for its durability, elegance, and excellent heat retention. Ceramic offers similar benefits, often at a more affordable price point. Glass, particularly double-walled glass, provides excellent insulation and allows you to appreciate the coffee's visual layers.

The choice of material also affects the cup's thermal properties. Porcelain and ceramic tend to retain heat longer than glass, keeping your cortado warmer for a more extended period. Glass, on the other hand, offers a sleek, modern aesthetic and doesn't impart any flavor to the beverage. Each material has its unique advantages, catering to different preferences and priorities.

**Insulation Properties:** Maintaining the optimal temperature of your cortado is critical for savoring its flavors. Double-walled cups are designed to provide superior insulation, preventing heat loss and keeping the coffee hot for a longer duration. Single-walled cups, while offering a more traditional feel, tend to lose heat more quickly.

Effective insulation not only keeps your cortado warm but also prevents the cup from becoming too hot to handle. Double-walled designs typically feature an air gap between the inner and outer layers, minimizing heat transfer and ensuring a comfortable grip. This is particularly important if you prefer to hold your cup directly without a handle.

**Design and Aesthetics:** The visual appeal of a cortado cup contributes significantly to the overall coffee-drinking experience. Classic designs often feature simple, elegant shapes with smooth surfaces. Modern interpretations may incorporate bolder colors, textures, and patterns. The choice of design is ultimately a matter of personal preference, reflecting your individual style and aesthetic sensibilities.

A well-designed cup enhances the presentation of the cortado, showcasing the rich crema and the contrasting layers of espresso and milk. The shape of the cup can also influence the aroma, directing the coffee's fragrant notes towards your nose as you sip. Whether you prefer a minimalist aesthetic or a more elaborate design, the right cup can elevate your coffee ritual to new heights.

**Handle Ergonomics:** While some cortado cups are designed without handles, others feature small, ergonomic handles for added convenience. The shape and size of the handle can significantly impact the cup's usability, particularly for those who prefer a secure and comfortable grip. A well-designed handle should fit comfortably in your hand, providing adequate support without feeling bulky or awkward.

The placement of the handle is also essential, ensuring that it doesn't interfere with your hand position or the natural flow of drinking. Handles that are too small or too close to the cup's body can make it difficult to hold, while those that are too large can feel unwieldy. The ideal handle should be seamlessly integrated into the cup's design, enhancing both its functionality and its aesthetic appeal.

 ## Core Benefits

The right cortado cup can profoundly impact your coffee-drinking experience, enhancing flavor, maintaining temperature, and adding a touch of elegance to your daily ritual. The core benefits extend beyond mere functionality, contributing to a more enjoyable and satisfying coffee experience.

**Enhanced Flavor Perception:** The shape and material of a cortado cup can influence how you perceive the coffee's flavors. A well-designed cup directs the aroma towards your nose, allowing you to fully appreciate the coffee's fragrant notes. The smooth surface of the cup also ensures that the coffee's flavors are not altered or distorted by any unwanted textures or materials.

By using the correct cup, you can unlock the full potential of your cortado, savoring the delicate balance of espresso and milk. The cup becomes a vessel that enhances the coffee's inherent qualities, elevating the overall sensory experience. This translates to a more nuanced and enjoyable tasting session.

**Optimal Temperature Retention:** Maintaining the ideal temperature of your cortado is crucial for savoring its flavors. Insulated cups, particularly those with double walls, keep your coffee warm for an extended period, allowing you to enjoy it at your leisure. This is particularly beneficial if you tend to sip your coffee slowly or if you're easily distracted by other tasks.

A warm cortado delivers a more satisfying and comforting experience, allowing you to fully appreciate the subtle nuances of the coffee's flavor profile. By keeping the coffee at the right temperature, the cup ensures that each sip is as enjoyable as the first. This leads to a more consistent and pleasurable coffee experience.

**Improved Aesthetic Experience:** The visual appeal of a cortado cup contributes significantly to the overall coffee-drinking experience. A beautifully designed cup adds a touch of elegance and sophistication to your daily ritual, making it feel more special and rewarding. The choice of design reflects your personal style and aesthetic sensibilities, adding a personal touch to your coffee routine.

A visually appealing cup elevates the presentation of the cortado, showcasing the rich crema and the contrasting layers of espresso and milk. This transforms the simple act of drinking coffee into a more mindful and appreciative experience, allowing you to savor each moment. The cup becomes an extension of your personality, reflecting your taste and preferences.

1kgy9ns,https://www.reddit.com/r/ikeahacks/comments/1kgy9ns/sofa_table_for_floating_couch/,Sofa Table for floating couch,"New here, but I have a floating couch in my living room and want to add a table behind it with charging and storage to remove the coffee table in front of it. Its big, 11.25ft long. I bought spiksmed cabinets after mocking them up in cardboard and seeing how they affect the traffic flow in the room, I like it. However I just got them, haven't assembled yet, and am second guessing a couple things.

1. They will be backed against the couch but not attached to it, which basically means they will be floating, and the base is fairly narrow at roughly 1ft. No small children for tipover concerns, but I am concerned about the longevity of the joints if they aren't backed up against a stable wall for their full life cycle. As such, ive looked into how to ensure they are sturdier assembled, and have seen suggestions for wood and CA glue and corner braces in inconspicuous places. But before I assemble, any other suggestions from anyone who has shared my same concerns?

2. I want to add charging to it, and would really like to do recessed or pop-up charging. I would love to have usb-c fast charging >=60w. I expect the use case for this table to be storage when standing behind the couch and food, drinks, and charging when sitting on the couch, so I am a little concerned about things like spills into charging ports, and keeping the flattest surface possible. Any suggestions on chargers and placement of them? Unfortunately I don't intend for it to come above the back of the couch, so I can't use the little narrow cubbies on top to protect chargers.

3. I was considering putting a countertop like surface on top, like a butcher block. 11.25ftx1ft is an odd size, but you know, thems the digs. Anyway, not exactly needing advice, but curious if anyone has ideas on how to do this cost efficiently, like t+g hardwood floor planks or something, and also how to make up the space between the sidewalls and the top of the 1st shelf.

Description:
Chilling at a café with a friend? Waiting at the airport with your partner? Hanging out at home with your sibling? Taking a short break at work?

But here’s the question: are you really doing something together?

That’s where Foxy Clash comes in.
Because while everyone’s glued to their own screen, this game asks you to share just one.

Foxy Clash is a collection of reflex-based mini games designed for two players on a single iOS device.
No accounts. No internet. Just open, tap, and play — face-to-face.

At the end of each game, the app randomly selects a reward from a list you create.
The winner waits in anticipation, while the loser has to complete the task.

Some examples:
	•	Buy a coffee
	•	Treat with dessert
	•	Do a funny dance
	•	Snap a selfie
	•	Sing a quick song
	•	Read a short story
	•	Do a simple task
	•	Draw something fun

After each match, players can take a photo, record a short video, or leave a note.
These are saved inside the Memories section — ready to be revisited later.

Free to Play Status:
	•	Free to play
	•	Demo/Key available
	•	Paid

Involvement:
I’m the solo developer of Foxy Clash. I designed, coded, and tested the game using SwiftUI + SpriteKit.

1kgy1qn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1kgy1qn/repost_looking_for_advice_with_contextualizing/,REPOST: Looking for advice with contextualizing (and possibly refunding) bulletproof script coverage feedback.,"My apologies if this isn't the right procedure for this kind of post-the whole situation feels so bizarre. 

This is a repost for a thread I shared last night–I was grabbing both links to the script as well as the review itself to post in the old thread's original post, and by the time I had figured how to go about it the mods had (understandably, per community guidelines) locked it. The ensuing post is rather long, so my apologies for that. I hope this is acceptably presented, because I'm trying hard to wrap my head around what I received from this service.

  
\*\*\*\*\*  
Hello there, long time lurker and first time poster with this. I paid for an Indie Film Hustle gold review of a small budget horror script I've been plugging away at and while I'm nor under any impression of it being something amazing (it's my first feature script), I don't think it warrants a clearly AI generated synopsis.

This is definitely not what I paid for and it also throws into doubt the lens the rest of the feedback was given in. I'm curious if anyone else has had this kind of situation happen through their service or has any idea of what to do?

I'm looking into the AI policy of this service, but there was a lot else that felt off about the feedback, and especially when comparing the later feedback to the synopsis it had me questioning how deep of a read this was of the material.  
I don't want to complain about this but the cost of this was $200 USD.

I think there's plenty for me to work on, but I also shouldn't be leaving with feedback that leaves me more confused, questioning how close the reader had read the source, or (due to the synopsis that seems both AI generated and gets the identities wrong of the central couple) unable to trust that the read was done in good faith. That also goes for places where the script was numerically panned for things that seem average and unintrusive by this reader's description (formatting getting a 1 and being described as essentially servicable, or the characters getting the same but that being contradicted with even how they're discussed as having fascinating aspects amidst their flaws being the two most glaring points).

I'm not chasing a high score for private coverage, I just feel like if I were to get a fiercely critical review for a work, I deserve for it to at the least be clearer than this, not with an AI summary, and not something that resultingly has me questioning if my script was read carefully or in good faith. It's not just demoralizing but actually feels exploitative, so...

Now I'm turning to this community, which I've quietly learned a wealth from for the past year, and asking if I should be pursuing a refund and if anyone has clarity on how to do so. Thank you all who engage for your time, the review and a link to the script (via Coverfly) follow.

Logline

An alternative lifestyle couple find their lives upturned when they are superseded by strange

avatars.



Synopsis

Smoked up and blissed out, Jude, metalhead femme, doesn’t notice when slimy hands emerge

from under the bed when they log onto a dating site that they and their lover Amani, androgyne,

masturbate to. Later, Amani goes on a flirty date with Gina. Jude and Amani have an open and

fluid relationship. Jude wants to come out to his parents, and dances around the subject with his

liberal father Harold.

Jude and Armani go to the movies, where they are stalked by lookalikes. Back at home, they both

check out options on the dating site Mirror Mirror, but find that avatars have taken over their

profiles. They are banned from the site. In a dreamscape, their masked avatars, in lingerie, suck

face. Is it a dream? Amani hangs with his brosis, Candice, tells her that they’re coming out to

Jude’s folks on Friday.

At No Land Beyond, people compare definitions of polyamory. Lola, a Polynesian trans, flirts with

Jude. They go back to their place, and hang with Tyler and his wife Wanda. They tease Jude, who

confirms their (current) monogamy. Joined by Ara and Kaspian, Wanda teases Jude that she

created their doppelgangers. After coming out, Jude is disappointed at his parents’ reaction. At

home, Jude and Amani argue: about the parental reaction; about cheating; about dates with Kali.

Jude thinks that Amani is just fucking around. They agree with Amani should go.

We flashback to Amani driving his stabbed father, Franklin, to the hospital. Amani hasn’t seen Kali

in the better part of a year, but Chaz tells them to leave a message. Margaret and Harold, it

seems, are setting up their kid’s avatar. they make Amano hit Jude, sending him back to them.

Luana tells Jude that there’s an opening in the Church of Google calendar.

Cool Jude starts talking to the real Jude: they embrace. Weird Jude confronts Amani, but Harold

interrupts. Beats Amani through the face. Jue has coffee with Cute Amani. Is this the

multiverse? The various facets convene at their apartment, but people step through shower

curtains and there’s doubt whether Harold is a real father. They decamp to some Melrose

apartments, whereon Cute Amani wonders about dating kali at the Smoothie King.

Dark Armani wants Jude as a keeper. He and Weird Jude kiss. Penis paranoia rules. Dark Amani

fucks Gina. Pink overwhelms the room. Kali and Luana talk about the concept of love Could they



be the real avatars? Margaret is frigid to Harold.

Various versions decamp to the “Da Club” and runs gauntlets of tricks of the mind. There are

silicone eggs, and eventually, in Cool Jude’s studio, the two Judes contemplate being twins in

public. They embark – in montage – in hedonism. Meanwhile, Dark Amani worries about pranks. All

of the various characters decide on one thing: they want to reconnect, and they want life to make

sense again.

They mangle each other’s bodies. They think they are monsters, but Jude escapes Dark Amani.

Jude tells Luana that Amani and Jude have been killed. Harold, believing in the chuckling of girls,

tells Margaret not to come back to bed. Chaz warns of copies swallowing people whole.

Dark Amani wonders about whether Kali an find her cunty nesting partner. Cursed Kali worries

about jealousy. Harold watches as various characters and variations are subordinated into collar

action. In the final confrontation, a certain kind of parental acceptance is achieved. Harold wants

to rescue his daughter from the demons.

In the final confrontation, Cursed Kali stabs Jude with the Magic Wand. The Barista is pissed.

Three months later, our duo try to make sense of events. Parents are scary.



Opening Thoughts Insights to address budget concerns, storytelling style, target audience,

genre impact, and any other high-level elements that could impact this script's success or failure

as a independent production ($3mm - $20mm).



In terms of budget, this is a story that seems eminently realizable. Relying on a series of sets that

could be easily incorporated into sound stage scenarios, coupled with perhaps some stock

topography of exteriors, there's nothing to indicate that - even a story that might sometimes have

a dalliance with the supernatural - might require any significant sense of CGI or practical effects. In

short, this seems like a project that could be achieved almost on a micro budget, especially in its

reliance on character actors to parse out the dynamic of the script.

The storytelling is a stream of consciousness that in the main seems almost entirely

incomprehensible. There are some deep hidden themes (which we can explore later in terms of

what this story might be about), but they very quickly fracture into a series of disconnected

sequences that leaves little for an audience to invest in.

There may well be future drafts that could make us care more for the characters (see notes



below), but in this draft we are presented with a carousel of extremely weird people -which is part

of the implicit attraction of a story like this - that nevertheless leaves us distanced from

understanding these characters.

There are no stakes. One could genuinely ask why the idea of Jude and Amani coming out to the

parents means something, but only if we can see any significance impact about what these

choices might make. The story surrenders itself to an increasingly frenetic series of disattached

events, as if a multiple series of horror tropes collided together, but without giving the audience a

sense of what the final outcome might be or even whether we should care for it. Future drafts

should really try and make us care about events.

The structure itself does not take the time to give us a sense of how we are supposed to react to

events. The character work is shallow, leaving us to wonder why we should care about whether

Jude and Amani should even be together in the first place: what their goals are in terms of their

mutual satisfactions, and how this is either perverted or subordinated by an external cast that

doesn't seem to have their best interests at heart. In short, this is a story without values.

There seems to be a lot of deliciously weird and surreal events, but they never really coalesce into

a story that has a theme or an objective.

The style settles on a kind of “meet cute” about Jude and Amani in the early sequences, but

doesn’t really cement why this couple is even together in the first place. Let’s see, in future drafts,

why their love is a wonderful thing that needs to be maintained at all costs.



Comparable Projects

Liquid Sky (1982) seems a direct correlation to a script of this nature. Like this project, it dwells on



the emotional canyons of the lives of people trapped in the Gotham roundelay of sexual bed-

hopping. Genre-wise, it’s a slightly different tack on events (it’s about aliens in 1908s Queer



downtown culture), but it shares the same delightful sense of margins being explored, of people

needing one thing but maybe finding another. The two projects share the same essential tonal

qualities.

Mulholland Drive (2001), although set on the west coast, rather than the east, has a similar

sensibility of carnal desire, in its depiction of two people drawn together; not only by desire but

also a sense of foreboding: of things being lost if neither person steps up and affirms their

commitment to the other. It might be a useful exercise in telegraphing the emotional core of Jude

and Amani.



Identity Theft (2004) is set in a tonally different universe to this project, but it also – in a story of a

woman who finds her life being pulled from under her - has interesting lessons about portraying a

person who loses an existential sense of self.



Originality/Premise

One strength of the project is, of course, that there are so many different voices, all of them

clamoring for their own sense of identity and purposefulness. This is particularly acute, and is a

real strength, in terms of what a couple might even think of each other; even as they negotiate the

foothills of their nascent sexuality. This is a story about, ultimately, negotiation, and the

sensitivities involved.

Jude and Amani both display a wonderful sense of fragility, even as they mask it via bluster, or

banter, or the sense of two people trying to love one another but also setting boundaries. This is

easily the most compelling aspect of the project: the sense that one might try hard to assert

oneself, but also that exterior perceptions might corrupt (and this is certainly a story about

corruption!) the very essence of commitment and fidelity. This reader loved the inherent sense of

character fragility, of innocence exposed and let vulnerable; but this also, to be candid, felt like an

underexploited story aspect.

The third act would benefit from a greater sense of what ‘loss’ between these couple might

actually mean. At no point do we see our base duo consider the prospect of what their emotional

discorporation might mean. Can they love without one another: maybe one of them can but the

other can’t. What would this look like?

These fundamental truths tend to be sacrificed into a pell mell of bizarre surrealism, without

ending on an essential human bargain. Who wins in the end (it’s not clear and it should be)?



Plot/Structure

The story is hobbled, overall, by an entire lack of narrative coherence. It’s a fantastic and surreal

story. But it seems happy to sacrifice any remote sense of conventional storytelling. That’s a hold

choice, but it leaves little for an audience to inset themselves as understanding what the heck is

going on. This draft mainlines n a stream of consciousness of vignettes and unrelated sequences,

none of which combine to give a sense of narrative momentum. This is, in short, a story without

much in the way of a comprehensible narrative. By p.33, when Amani is arguing with Chaz, the

audience is unlikely to have any remote sense of what plot logic is being invoked. Consider future



drafts that might set the stakes up with more clarity.

We don’t really get’ what the surrogate parents are aiming for, what their animus might be.

These background segments offer little insight into what might be unfolding. Most sequences

parse between (admittedly delightful) observational sections of alternative lifestyles but with zero

sense of the stakes. The storytelling style is fractured, seemingly uninterested in setting up the

most basic of plot points. What do either of our main duo have to lose?

There’s little contextual information in these visions to show us whether this is a fever dream;

whether a real demon has entered the bathroom; or what we are supposed to be discerning.

A huge cast of undeveloped supporting characters fade in and out of Amani and Jude’s lives, with

little sense of about who is actually important. As potentially interesting as these colorful

characters are, consider future drafts that might make them impinge as more important, rather

than casual passerby commentators on vague lifestyle choices to be made.

People are stabbed, but there’s no contextual information. People ‘cheat’ on one another, but

there’s no sense of initial rules or barriers in the first place. The overwhelming sensibility is of an

almost epilepsy-inducing series of flashed and disconnected events that are unlikely to coerce an

audience into following these discordant and sporadic actions, populated by a cast that we never

really get to know.

The subplot about the avatars is fascinating... but only if it can, at some point, take center stage.

The plot descends, in the climax, into a kind of surreal fugue state; but it also leaves the audience

behind. There are so many variations of each character that no one emerges as somebody to root

for.



Characters/Casting Potential

Some great work in the first act is about how Jude and Amani are negotiating their sense of

individual self, but also their sense as a couple. This fractures, genre wise, into a surreal

kaleidoscope of various different identities.

However, even though this is the objective strength of this draft, it also feels like the variations of

these characters - from the dark personas to the real and innocent personas, via the protestations

of fascistic and oppressive parental perceptions - tend to overwhelm our original couple.

Consider future drafts that can take more time in terms of establishing the emotional fractures



between this couple, before their existential crisis and losing themselves. One question to ask

oneself might be: what hapens to a person when their self is essentially hijacked? In this draft,

there are so many variations of each character that the essential essence of our original

protagonists becomes lost, between too many multiverse equations that don’t establish

themselves as distinctive in their own right.

Let’s see what crucial sense of identity is being bowdlerized, corrupted, and/or used to nefarious

ends, and let's see how our original characters feel about this loss of self. The script tends to

introduce variations without showing us the consequences or the impact on the original

characters. It's clear that Jude and Amani - in a really cool series of meet cutes opening sequences

\- have a febrile and fragile but loving relationship. However, it's not clear, as the second and third

acts unfold, what sense of themselves are being lost, of what these people need to hold on to, to

fervently grasp onto, in order to continue to demonstrate their love for one another.

The gimmickry of the plotting, whilst extremely welcome in terms of a radical genre portrait of

fluid sexuality, tends to relegate our duo to the margins of all the other shenanigans that take

place. We never really get to know them beyond their delightful intimacy.Even though there's a

great sense of dark irony in the way that events play out, this reader found themselves somewhat

deflated by the clima:, in that the characters that I might have cared for became somewhat

relegated to a series of bizarre scenarios that didn't really give any of them closure.

Consider future variations wherein we really do see an emotional closure, especially in relationship

to a couple that you have spent so much time and care on, in the opening act, to establish a sense

of mutual affection, reliance, and simple human connection. Even though this is, purposefully by

design, a story about cynical hijacks of what a person might be, maintaining some final emotional

core at the ending might add additional resonance.



Dialogue

The dialogue is a consistent delight throughout; to the point where it almost seems redundant to

pick out individual sections. Suffice to say, there is a certain archness in this polyvalent and multi

sexual world, that seems consistent throughout:- not just in terms of character consistency but

also in terms of just how engaging this fluid world is. Even sequences in which Jude and Amani

swap heartfelt protestations of fidelity - of needing to sustain a sense of each other – are also

punctuated with a delightful sense of bitchiness and cattiness that seems entirely appropriate

within this genre exercise.

The dialogue is especially useful in papering over some of the weaker narrative cracks. In short



that we might, as the audience, begin to get lost in the complexity of events, the dialogue always

helps in terms of sustaining a sense of engagement.



Format

The formatting is, overall, fine, and this is an economical and fluid read. It plays out in frenetic

fashion, purposefully jumping between characters and scenarios, but manages to sustain a real

sense of dynamism. There are no significant typos or formatting issues to derail what is a delicious

read.



Voice/Themes

There are some interesting themes raised in this draft, that address huge issues of love, and what

form that may take in an alternative lifestyle. The strength of this project lies in its innate

questioning of what identity might be: of how Jude and Amani’s own domestic needs and desires

might play out over a backdrop of dysfunctional parental consent and/or approbation. However,

consider introducing a greater sense of what this duo wants in the first place.

A weakness in this draft is that we, as the audience, don’t get a sense of just how close, or how

concerned, both of our main characters are, in terms of how they want to manifest their lives. It’s

clearly important (and a great first act plot impetus) that the concept of parental ‘approval’ is

required, but, frankly, one wonders why? Our couple are ensconced in a mutually supportive and

confident way of life, in which playing outside the boundaries is inherently part of a consensual

and experimental relationship: so why does it matter so much that parental consent is important?

Consider specifying what might be the consequence if this isn’t given. This might help emphasize

why there is this dramatic longing for some form of familial benediction. Frankly, both Jude and

Amani wouldn’t be the first Manhattan couple not to need consent to live their lives...

Regardless, there’s a brilliant sense that identity is mutable. That it can be co-opted, and stolen in

a bizarre form of identity theft; at our very cores, in current society, where identity is, perhaps, the

only thing that individuals may have left. This is extremely strong dramatic sauce, and if there is a

sense – a greater sense – that identity theft can cause a sense of dislocation, of being stolen from,

then this would only add to the emotional stakes.

Two questions:
1) I had a rhinoplasty and was breathing through my mouth for two weeks. I couldn't help it. I switched to plain yogurt and kept up dental hygiene but using flossing picks instead (mouth soreness and loss of mobility for thread flossing) 

2) im very determined to hold on to my fillings for as long as possible. With top care, how long can they possibly last? 

3) is 5 months too early for another set of bite wing xrays? 

4) I really am having a hard time without coffee. My dentist told me it's fine, just drink it fast and follow up with water and then brushing 30 minutes after. I use silk almond creamer (4g of sugar). Can I acrually keep this up or will it again spiral my teeth?

So I recently downloaded District by Zomato after seeing 250000 ads and 5000 influencer promotions. The disappointment I faced was subpar ti their customer resolutions. District dining dekh ke laga app ka UI bhi keh raha ho, “Main kya hi kar raha hoon yahan?”

Deepinder ne 2 baje raat ko socha- Let’s launch District Dining — it’ll be premium, aspirational, path-breaking. Aur phir? So gya. 
Gradient daala, disco ball chipka diya, same Pro discounts copy-paste kar diye… aur launch ho gaya bhai. Literally looks like someone did Ctrl+C Pro, Ctrl+V into a Canva file and said: ‘Ship it.’

First of all — yeh UI dekh kar sirf ek hi cheez yaad aati hai “Expectation: 5-star dining | Reality: 5-year-old’s PowerPoint.” Party Vibes? Disco ball. Matlab kya hi karein ab, Govinda ko bula lein? Luxury Dining? Ek wine glass aur samosa ka photoshoot chal raha hai. Romantic Dining? So dry, even my ex said, “damn, thoda spice daal dete.”

Poora screen dekh ke lagta hai product team ne bola ho “Kuch bhi karo, bas new lagna chahiye. Useful hone ki zarurat nahi hai.”

UX? Non-existent. Aur inke chutiye discounts-

Valid only if you find Narnia, complete 3 quests, and make eye contact with the chef. You click on 50% Off and poof — half the places don’t even accept it.
It’s like Tinder matches: looks exciting, ends in confusion, and you pay anyway. Scroll karte jao — same restaurant teen baar aata hai in different categories.

Kya kar rahe ho, bhai?
“Family dining,” “Romantic dining,” and “Party Vibes” — same dhaba, same butter naan.

And filters? LOL.
Filter laga ke lagta hai tumne AI se keh diya ho, “Show me chaos but in grid view.”

Leadership ne agar is UI ko dekh ke bola, “This will blow people’s minds,” toh please… ek baar Swiggy Dineout open kar lo. Unka bhi restaurant card chutiya hi hai but UX toh acha hai aur 15 app toh nhi download karne hote. 

District Dining legit lagta hai jaise lunch break mein bana, aur coffee run ke time approve bhi ho gaya.


Bro, forget fine dining — yeh fine ka bhi insult hai.

I have a local roaster who sells 6lb bags. I will normally buy one, and upon receipt, put it into an airtight vacuum container. 

It is more advantageous to purchase two bags at a time for cost considerations. 

With the second bag (which is their own packaging) should I just freeze it unopened or should I still break it down into smaller packages?

My goal would be to finish the first 6lb bag, then open the second and put it into the airtight vacuum container all at once. I don’t plan on needing to take out smaller portions at a time…

And if so, should I still take their bag and put that into a ziplock?  If so, I’d need a very large ziplock. :).

Two months ago, I joined a marketing agency as a senior content strategist. During onboarding, I noticed concerning security practices - client passwords shared via unencrypted emails, sensitive files on personal devices, and team members accessing account data from public WiFi without VPNs.

As someone who previously worked at a company that suffered a major data breach, these behaviors set off alarm bells. After witnessing a colleague download our biggest client's entire analytics dashboard to a personal laptop at a coffee shop, I privately spoke with my manager about implementing basic security protocols.

My manager brushed me off, saying they've ""never had problems before"" and that I was being ""overly corporate"" about security policies.

Last week, that same client reported suspicious access to their account from an unknown location. During the emergency meeting, my manager suddenly turned to me and asked pointed questions about my ""unusual interest"" in security practices. They implied I might be responsible since I ""knew so much about potential vulnerabilities.""

Since then:

* I've been removed from all client-facing projects with no explanation
* Three teammates have canceled our 1:1 meetings
* My access to shared drives was ""accidentally"" revoked twice
* The office manager asked me if I was planning to ""report the company"" to someone

Yesterday, I overheard my manager telling our director that I ""came from a competitor"" (I didn't) and had been ""asking suspicious questions about client access"" since day one.

I'm genuinely shocked at how quickly this escalated from me trying to help improve practices to being treated like a corporate saboteur. I've done absolutely nothing wrong, but perception seems to be reality here.

The slanted exterior walls have made planning the layout quite difficult, and I haven’t been able to figure it out.

How would you furnish the apartment based on the attached floor plan? Currently, I have a queen-sized bed (160 cm wide) and a work/gaming setup (desk and office chair, 140 cm wide). I'm planning to add a small dining set for 2–3 people, a compact sofa, a coffee table, and a TV (preferably wall-mounted).

I’d really like to keep the bedroom reserved just for sleeping and nighttime activities, but I can’t find a way to fit the workstation into the living room. Should I just give up on that idea and keep the setup in the bedroom—even though the walk-in closet in there limits placement options?

Any tips or layout ideas would be greatly appreciated! I've already tried AI and other decoration planners without success.

I first used it to measure my tap water. The measurement seemed correct, compared to the official numbers that are published by my state (about 250 PPM).

Those 3 measures showed me that the PPM-Meter seemed to be doing an alright job.

Now here is the problem. I turned on my machine (Lelit Mara X) and waited for it to be hot, just to be sure.

Today's prayer and meditation reading reminds us of a great spiritual road, **God blesses every sincere effort we make toward the Good.** He does not demand perfection, only willingness. He meets us halfway, and where our strength ends, His begins. When we persist, even faintly, Heaven answers boldly.

Yesterday, Dan bore witness to a beautiful miracle, not only his life being restored, but the ripples reaching out, touching others, lifting others. That is the true radiance of Step Twelve. When we give freely what has been freely given to us, **we are channels of Divine Love**. This, friends, is what it means to be successful in the eyes of Heaven.

When I examine my own life, it becomes plain, **your love saved me**. Your laughter in the meetings, your tears, your late-night calls, your coffee stained Big Books. These things didn't just heal me, they repaired my relationships. With family. With strangers. With myself. A rising tide of grace lifted everything.

Step Three was the pivot. The surrender. The prayer that became a door. And many of you reminded me, **we can shape our prayers like clay**. They are not spells but spiritual tools, molded by the heart, guided by the Spirit.

Even science agrees, kindness lifts us all. When I am kind to you, my body creates joy. When you receive it, you feel joy. And those who witness it, yes, even they, are touched. Serotonin is a messenger of God.

There was a time I thought I was nobody, kicking stones and cursing the sky. But sobriety revealed something new, **I am a child of God, and so are all of those following**.

Carl woke up next to his wife just as he had since he was 19. He wasn’t surprised to see that his daughter, Ava, had climbed into bed just between them in the middle of the night. She had been having nightmares for a few days now. He used his phone’s flash to figure out what to wear to work that morning. He scrolled through Instagram for a few minutes while his coffee brewed. 

“I’m going to give a random homeless person ten thousand dollars today.” 

He sighed and scrolled. Ava had gotten onto his phone again messing up his algorithm. He hadn’t even seen her awake in days. 

He skipped his usual egg and toast, having gotten some bacon for his wife and daughter the day prior. He hadn’t realized how much it cost, and decided to skip breakfast for a few days to make up for the money spent. 

Black coffee in hand, he made his way to the bus stop. 



Clocking in, he put in his code. 28882. 6:58 am. He moved towards the warehouse and picked up a box of old textbooks to be digitized. As he sat down with a sigh, a voice whispered. 

“Please remember me”. 

The hairs across his arms stood. It sounded as if the sound had come from a drum inside his head. 

He checked just behind him, looking over his shoulder, standing in his cubicle to see where the sound had come from. There he found a new cubicle mate, blasting music through his headphones so loud it was audible to everyone else on the floor. 

The sound must have come from his new neighbor’s music. He looked over and read his new neighbor’s name, “Karl Prescott”. Quite similar to my own, he thought to himself. 

He carried on with his day, slowly copying an old math textbook from the 1600s. He read the name “Robert Recorde”, a mathematician born in 1510, only living for a short 58 years thereafter. He had invented the basis of mathematics. 

‘The first equation written in modern notation, 14x + 15 = 71’

“I can solve that!” He stared at it for a few moments, finally whispering “4” to himself. His new neighbor peeked over the cubicle. Perhaps the whisper wasn’t quite as quiet as he had thought. 



Carl Prescott’s shift had ended after dark on the warm summer night. After 5 hours of overtime, Robert Recorde’s “The Grounde Of Artes” will be reserved in online records for the rest of time. 

He strolled to the bus stop pulling his coat around his neck. He felt a cold shiver come across him, all while the warm air and his warm coat made him sweat all over. 

Staring out the window Carl came across a crow covered in blood with a black cat’s lifeless body hanging from its beak. The cat was at least twice the size of the crow, but still the crow was able to hop effortlessly with the cat in its beak. From atop the bus stop under which the crow danced, stood an owl following Carl’s wide stare with eyes identical to his. 2 hazel eyes abnormally small for an owl, with a small black slit in the brown of his left eye.

He closed his eyes and held his breath for a moment. When he opened them he caught the animals just out of the corner of his eye, before slamming them shut again until it was past. 



Gosh it was quiet. The house was dark again. He had asked his wife to keep the living room lights on when he was working overtime, but old habits die hard. He cleaned a few of the dishes, and left a bacon grease soaked pan to soak in soapy water until morning. 

He sat down to play a video game for an hour before heading to sleep. He pulled up Hollow Knight, and waited for the game to launch. 

“Please Remember Me” covered the screen in plain white text, and flickered a few times. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath just as he had on the bus. 

This ritual was cut short by 3 knocks at the door. Carl flinched and opened his eyes to the Hollow Knight start screen. He looked through the peephole but couldn't see anyone in the dark. He opened the door and looked out to find a trail of blood leading to his front steps. He looked down and found the crow, hopping around in a circle, the cat still at its beak. When the crow noticed Carl, he looked up and dropped the cat, nudging it towards him. A cold wind came through while the cat’s chest fell, and didn’t rise again. 

The wind carried a whisper, “Please remember me”. 

Carl slammed the door shut at the sight of blood covering the floor. He began walking to his bed when there was another 3 knocks. 

Before he could make it to the bottom of the stairs another cold wind came over him. Frozen in place, he could only watch.

“Please remember me” he whispered over the household, before ascending to the next life. 



Ava woke up in the middle of the night from yet another nightmare. She went downstairs to get a glass of milk and put it in the microwave, just as her dad had told her to do. “Warm milk helps you sleep, but if you’re still scared, come and sleep next to me”. 

She tripped over something soft at the foot of the stairwell, before finding the lightswitch to put her toy away. 

When she saw the cold skin flaking off of her father’s corpse she screamed at the top of her lungs and ran up to her mom. 

In a slightly confused daze, Emily ran down the stairs before stopping at the corpse. Ava clung to her mother’s side, her face slowly being covered in tears. Her mother whispered, almost too quietly to hear “I will. I always will”. ",1,1746625806.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1kgxtwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1kgxtwi/explore_the_pallyou_sliding_tray_for_coffee_maker/,Explore the Pallyou sliding tray for coffee maker review perfect for kitchen organization,"Testing out the Sliding Tray for Coffee Maker by Pallyou (model B0DXF74MQK) over the past couple of weeks has been an intriguing journey. As someone who regularly navigates the delicate dance of keeping my kitchen neat while accommodating various appliances, this sliding tray instantly caught my interest. It became my partner in crime for taming the kitchen chaos. While it has undoubtedly enhanced my countertop organization, there are some aspects to weigh before committing to it.

**Design and Build Quality**

The first thing I noticed was how sturdy this appliance slider feels. Made from solid natural bamboo, it boasts a three-layer design with a thickness of 0.6 inches. It’s not just about aesthetics, though the bamboo finish does bring a sleek, modern vibe. It means business with its ability to support up to a hefty 40 lbs without so much as a creak or bend. My kitchen sees its fair share of coffee spills and occasional juice mishaps, and I’m pleasantly surprised that this tray shrugs it off like it’s nothing. It’s built for longevity, and practicality clearly took the front seat during the design process. 

Then there’s the textured surface, which subtly improves friction to prevent appliances from rocking during use. It’s clever and makes me appreciate how thoughtfully made this tray is. Oh, and those rubber wheels? Brilliant. It slides across the counter like melted butter—no scratches, no squeaky noises.

**Performance and Ease of Use**

Easy doesn’t even begin to cover it. Sliding heavy appliances in and out of cabinets or from under hanging cupboards was always a bit of a balancing act. During those half-awake pre-coffee mornings, it’s a small miracle not to spill or bump things. This sliding tray has streamlined the process. With smooth-rolling rubber wheels, my coffee maker glides out effortlessly without sounding like I’m moving furniture. Stability is nailed, too. The tray grips to the countertop, thanks to the non-slip silicone pads. No unexpected slides that catapult my French press into oblivion! 

The 16""x13"" variant I chose was perfect for my trusty two-way coffee maker, but the product’s versatility shines through its multiple size options. It caters just as well to larger appliances like air fryers or smaller ones like single-serve espresso machines.

**Favorable Aspects**

- Smooth rubber wheels ensure silent and effortless sliding.  
- Non-slip silicone pads keep the tray stable on the counter.  
- Made of durable bamboo that’s resistant to spills and warping.  
- Can hold appliances weighing up to 40 pounds.  
- Elegant, textured surface adds sophistication and effective functionality.  

**Caveats**

- While the bamboo finish looks great, it may require occasional cleaning to maintain its polished look, especially after spills.  
- The larger size occupied more counter space than expected—it’s worth double-checking measurements.  

**Competing Products**

Comparing this tray to others already in the market was eye-opening. Plastic alternatives are cheaper, but they lack the longevity and refined look the bamboo offers. A few competitive trays only support weight up to 20 lbs, leaving me skeptical about stability under the strain of heavier appliances. While other brands provide similar sliding solutions, none brought together the trifecta of durability, style, and functional design quite like this one. However, slightly cheaper models with simpler friction pads could appeal to those who are less picky about aesthetics. The grip innovation here, though, undeniably sets Pallyou apart.  

**Bang for the Buck**

In terms of value, this tray delivers a strong price-to-quality ratio. You aren’t just buying a board on wheels; this is a well-thought-out problem-solver for your kitchen. While competitors offer lower price points, their products often lack the durability and design that make this tray a worthy investment. It’s a smart buy for someone looking to keep a space organized and minimize time spent wrestling with clunky kitchen gadgets. Over the testing period, every penny spent on this appliance slider started to feel justified.

I (25M) am heading back to Warsaw *again* this weekend to visit my girlfriend. I’ll be arriving Friday morning around 8 AM, but she’s working until the afternoon — so I’m looking for some ideas on how to spend the day.

The twist is: I’ve already been to Warsaw many times, and I’ve done most of the classic “must-sees” (even multiple times) — like Old Town, the Palace of Culture, Wola, Fabryka Norblin, Łazienki Park, the university rooftop, even Dom Keret, etc.

So I’d love to hear your recommendations for:

* Nice neighborhoods or areas to just walk around / explore
* Maybe even less touristy parks or green spaces

Additionally, but less important as for these there are already plenty on the sub either way

* Any cool exhibitions, small museums, or pop-up events happening
* Good spots to eat or grab coffee (preferably local, not chains)

Basically, anything you think a returning visitor would appreciate, especially things locals enjoy that don’t always make it onto the usual tourist lists.

Platform: iOS
Playable Link: https://testflight.apple.com/join/MDuC3q7d
Status: Free to play

Description:
Foxy Clash is a local 2-player iOS game designed to bring people together through quick, competitive, face-to-face mini-games. It’s played entirely on a single device, with both players interacting on the screen at the same time.

This is an updated version following an earlier TestFlight post I made. Based on feedback and internal testing, I’ve implemented several improvements in gameplay mechanics, visuals, performance, and overall polish.

The game features a growing collection of mini-games that test reflexes, memory, timing, and precision. Whether you’re waiting at a coffee shop or relaxing at home, Foxy Clash creates a fun, shared moment in just a few seconds. What makes it even more engaging is the real-life prize twist: before each match, players agree on a prize (e.g., “loser does the dishes”), making every game meaningful.

The app is completely offline, requires no sign-up, and has no ads. It’s designed for couples, friends, siblings, and even rivals – anyone who wants to have real-time fun together without online distractions.

Involvement:
I’m the solo developer of Foxy Clash. I designed, coded, and tested the game using SwiftUI + SpriteKit. I’m currently in the TestFlight beta phase and looking for feedback on gameplay, balance, UI/UX, and fun ideas you’d like to see added.",1,1746625722.0,TestFlight,0,1.0,False

I’ve also been thinking that if the right mix of people shows up, maybe we could even explore a side project or startup idea. Starting something alone can be hard to stay motivated for — but doing it with others might make it a bit more real and more fun.

1kgxq78,https://www.reddit.com/r/Review/comments/1kgxq78/can_anyone_please_review_the_first_chapter_of_my/,Can anyone please review the first chapter of my novel I'm working on,"Have you ever wondered what it feels like to feel nothing? I don't mean sadness. I don't mean indifference. I mean nothing. Absolute, clean, surgical absence. It's not a void. It's not a black hole swallowing emotion. It's the complete lack of need for emotion in the first place. Like a man with no mouth watching others scream. I observe people like a biologist studies decay. I register behavior, I note patterns, and I catalog reactions. That's all.

Right now, I'm sitting across from Mitchell Harper in my office. He's sobbing into a tissue like the saltwater leaking from his ducts might baptize him into something better. Forty-six years old. Private equity firm. Three homes, two ex-wives, and a history of carefully disguised cruelty that he's mistaken for strength.

""Dr. Creed... I, uh... I did it again,"" he finally says, voice trembling just enough to pass for remorseful. ""I couldn't help myself. I swear, I—I just get so angry. She doesn't understand what I need, you know?""

I nod. Measured. Nonjudgmental. The posture of empathy without the burden of actually carrying it. He thinks he's unloading guilt. He doesn't understand what guilt is. He's here because the illusion of redemption is cheaper than admitting who he really is.

And then it stirs.

The Need.

It isn't a voice. It doesn't speak in words. It presses from the inside, like a gas leak behind the eyes. A throb. A demand. A craving for justice—no, for balance. For removal. I don't kill for pleasure. I don't kill for anger. I kill like a gardener prunes dead branches—because it's necessary. Because someone has to. And I've been gifted with the absence of hesitation.

So, I feed The Need. Occasionally. Methodically. I've never been caught because I don't want to be caught. I've never made a mistake because I'm not capable of emotion-driven errors. And I never choose randomly. I only remove those who've earned their expiration.

I am Simon Creed. Psychotherapist. Human filter. I live in Boston. My house is a sleek mid-century modern at 1078 El Sereno. From the outside, it's the picture of respectability. Inside is my wife, Claire. Dark-haired. Elegant. If I were capable of love, I suppose I'd say she's beautiful. Her smile makes people feel understood, though it does nothing to me.

We have one child. Emma, seven. If I were built to feel attachment, I'd probably describe her as gifted. The world would consider us fortunate.

But back in this room, Mitchell is unraveling.

""I just... I can't control it,"" he mutters.

""I think,"" I tell him, straightening the pen on my notepad with precise fingers, ""that control isn't what you're seeking. You're seeking permission. What if, instead, we explored the consequences of your actions—not just for her, but for you?""

He looks up, confused. Vulnerable.

Perfect.

I check my calendar. ""Let's schedule a follow-up session. Perhaps somewhere more private. My office after hours, perhaps?"" I suggest, my voice as smooth as polished stone.

When Mitchell leaves, I clean the couch with sanitizer. Not because I'm afraid of germs—though who isn't these days—but because I like the smell. It's sterile. Final. Something about it washes away the conversation we just had, the deals we just made. It's honest in a way people aren't.

I check my watch: 4:42 PM. Traffic will be hell.

The sun hangs low as I drive east on the 10, away from Century City's glass towers and Beverly Hills' Bentleys, toward a neighborhood that still has chain-link fences and cracked sidewalks. El Sereno. Working-class, immigrant-heavy, unremarkable. Perfect camouflage.

My house sits on a quiet street, wedged between a duplex with peeling paint and a family that grills carne asada every weekend. Two-bedroom stucco with a patchy brown lawn and a driveway cracked like dried mud. The kind of place nobody notices. That's the goal.

The front door sticks—been meaning to fix that since last summer. I have to shoulder it open, and immediately Lucy greets me like a heat-seeking missile.

""Daddy!"" she shouts, latching onto my leg with surprising strength for a four-year-old. ""Max threw spaghetti on the wall and Mommy said the s-word!""

Max appears behind her, face painted in tomato sauce like war paint, a plastic dinosaur clutched in one sticky hand. ""I made art!"" he announces proudly, pointing to what is indeed a Jackson Pollock-esque masterpiece of pasta and sauce on the beige wall by the dining table. ""T-Rex was hungry for 'sketti.""

Emma's laugh cuts through the chaos—tired but genuine. ""Your children are feral today,"" she says, walking over and kissing me briefly. Her skin smells like lavender dish soap and that particular brand of exhaustion only parents of young children know. She's still stunning, even in a faded UCLA t-shirt with mysterious stains and leggings that have seen better days. Long blond hair piled in a messy bun, dark circles under her eyes. If I had the capacity, I might say she looks like someone worth staying alive for.

""How was work?"" she asks, already turning back to the kitchen where something is beginning to burn.

""Same old,"" I lie, setting down my laptop bag. ""Budget meetings. Coffee that tastes like battery acid. You know.""

She nods absently, rescuing what appears to be garlic bread from the oven. ""Can you please get Max cleaned up? Dinner in ten.""

The kitchen table is a battlefield—overdue bills, grocery receipts, Lucy's crayon scribbles, Max's half-eaten apple slices, Emma's community college textbooks. She's trying to finish her nursing degree, one night class at a time. I admire her for it, even if I don't say it enough.

After I've wiped most of the sauce from Max's face and hands—a process that requires negotiation skills that would impress the State Department—we sit down for dinner. Emma serves reheated spaghetti and the slightly charred garlic bread. Lucy picks at her food. Max uses his fork as a catapult.

""Max, we eat with our utensils, not launch with them,"" I say, trying to sound stern but failing.

""But Daddy, it flies so good!""

""So well,"" Emma corrects automatically. Teacher's daughter.

After dinner, Emma sits down at the table again, rubs her forehead, and pulls out her phone calculator. ""We're late on the water bill again,"" she says. ""And preschool wants their check by Friday. I don't know how we're going to swing it. My student loan payment hit yesterday.""

I look at the numbers. $243.67 for water. $480 for preschool. A small price, all things considered. I press a kiss to her temple.

""We'll figure it out,"" I say. ""I might get some overtime this week.""

""You always say that.""

""And we're still here, aren't we?""

She doesn't smile, but she doesn't cry either. That's a win, in this house.

After the kids' bedtime routine—three books for Lucy, one for Max, two trips to the bathroom, one glass of water, and an extensive search for Mr. Bunny who was, predictably, under the bed—Emma collapses on the couch with her anatomy textbook.

""I'm going to meet David for a beer,"" I tell her. ""Won't be late.""

She nods without looking up. ""Say hi to him for me.""

I drive down to Murphy's Tap off Whittier. Neon buzzing, beer cheap, pool table warped in the middle like it's been through a war. The place smells like stale beer and decades of cigarette smoke that seeped into the walls before the smoking ban. David's already there, nursing a Bud Light, scrolling through his phone. He's got the build of a man who still lifts like he's in high school football and a high-and-tight haircut that screams cop from fifty paces. LAPD Lieutenant, East Division. My older brother.

He used to beat the hell out of bullies for me in middle school. Now he beats the hell out of criminals. Or pays people who do. We don't talk about that part.

""You're late, prick,"" he says, sliding me a pint without looking up. ""That's on you. I ordered ten minutes ago.""

""Traffic,"" I lie, taking a long sip. ""Also, I hate you.""

""Feeling's mutual,"" he replies with a half-smile. ""Emma and the kids good?""

""Yeah. Lucy asked about her Uncle Dave yesterday. Said she wants to ride in your police car.""

David laughs. ""Not happening. Last thing I need is your kid finding someone's forgotten cuffs or worse.""

Vic and Ramirez show up a few minutes later. Both detectives. Both wearing the same tired faces that come from seeing too much of what people do to each other. Vic's got twenty years on the force and a paunch that suggests he enjoys his retirement beer a little early each day. Ramirez is younger, sharper, with the hungry look of someone still trying to prove himself.

We talk baseball (Dodgers' pitching staff is falling apart), city politics (the new mayor is full of shit, according to David), the price of rent (criminal), Ramirez's never-ending divorce (she wants the boat, he never even liked the boat). Normal stuff. The kind of conversations that happen in bars all over America.

Then David stops talking mid-sentence, nodding toward the front window. Two guys outside, early twenties maybe, one White, one Latino. One passes a small bag. The other, cash. Sloppy. Amateur hour.

David stands. ""Amateurs,"" he mutters, like he's personally offended by their lack of discretion.

He's out the door before anyone else moves. Vic follows, hand already near his waistband where I know he carries his off-duty piece. I stay seated. I like watching things unfold from a distance. Always have.

Through the window, I can see David doesn't even flash his badge. ""Yo, dipshits!"" he shouts. ""Hands where I can see 'em!""

The taller one bolts—wrong move. Vic tackles him into the sidewalk like he's been waiting all week for that moment. The shorter one freezes, lets the bag fall. White powder puffs up like cursed pixie dust under the streetlight.

David cuffs him with practiced efficiency. ""Coke, really? In front of a bar full of cops? What, you high already?""

Ramirez has stepped outside too, already on his radio. Five minutes later, red and blue lights strobe across the street. DEA guys show up, slow and smug in their windbreakers. Local-federal jurisdiction is always a pissing contest.

David comes back inside, brushing off his sleeves like he just cleaned his garage. ""Feds'll clean it up,"" he says, grabbing his beer. ""Let's get back to the good part. I ain't even buzzed yet.""

We raise glasses. ""To dumb crooks,"" Vic says.

""To job security,"" Ramirez adds.

I nod. ""To moral order.""

Nobody notices I haven't laughed once. Nobody ever does.

On the way home, I stop at La Cueva, a quiet Mexican place on Cesar Chavez where the salsa's too hot and the booths always smell faintly of bleach. I park across the street to grab takeout for Emma. Tuesday nights are our routine—enchiladas verdes for her, chile relleno for me. The normality of it centers me.

That's when I see him. Mitchell Harper. He's standing near the alley behind the restaurant, partially obscured by the dumpster. Not with his wife. With another woman—brunette, young, too thin, probably a waitress from the restaurant based on her black uniform pants. She's crying. Pleading. I can't hear words, but her body says enough: arms crossed over her chest, shoulders caved inward. Then he slaps her. Hard. Open palm. Whips her neck sideways. The sound carries across the parking lot—a crack that reminds me of leather belts against skin.

And just like that, *The Need* rises. A pressure behind my eyes. A humming in my ears. I told it to be patient. I told it Mitchell was trying. That some monsters can be leashed. That the sessions he'd been attending with me—court-mandated therapy for domestic violence—were working. Or so I'd thought.

But *The Need* doesn't care about confessions or change. It only cares about patterns. And Mitchell Harper's pattern is clear now.

I drive on. Slowly. I watch him help her into a silver BMW like nothing happened. He smooths her hair where he'd struck her, kisses her temple. She flinches. He pretends not to notice. They drive away, and I memorize his license plate, though I already have his address from his patient file. My hands shake as I pick up our dinner. The cashier asks if I'm feeling okay. I mutter something about low blood sugar.

I go home to Emma. Eat dinner. Ask about her day teaching third-graders. Do the dishes. Watch a documentary about penguins. We make love. I fall asleep with my arm around her, her breathing steady against my chest. All normal. All routine. But *The Need* doesn't sleep.

For eight consecutive days, I maintain my practice schedule. Nine patients each day. Notes dictated between sessions. Staff meetings on Thursday. Lunch with colleagues on Friday. Everything ordinary. But my evenings change. I follow Mitchell Harper. I learn his routine. I document when he returns home. When lights go off. When sprinklers hiss on. When he takes his evening Valium—a prescription I wrote for him myself.

He lives in the Hollywood Hills, tucked behind a gated community full of glass, steel, and people pretending they're not made of rot. His driveway is polished granite. His garage houses two Teslas and a Porsche. I observe from down the street in a rental—tinted windows, engine off, no movement. He lives alone now. The wife left two months ago. He said it was ""amicable."" The court had dropped the charges after she recanted. Classic.

I tell Emma I'm working late on case files. Not a complete lie. Mitchell Harper is a case. Just not one I'm solving through therapy anymore.

On the ninth day, I make preparations. My private practice occupies the ground floor of a three-story medical building I purchased five years ago. The upper floors house a dermatologist and an orthodontist. The basement, however, is mine alone. On paper, it's storage space for patient records and medical supplies. In reality, it's where *The Need* is satisfied.

I tell my receptionist Jeanine I'll be working late reviewing files. She smiles, reminds me not to work too hard. If only she knew what work really meant. After everyone leaves, I spend two hours setting up the basement. I clean the stainless steel table. Check the drainage system—a custom modification that runs through multiple filters before connecting to the main sewer line. I inventory my chemicals. Prepare the two high-density polyethylene barrels—one for the hydrofluoric acid solution, one for the remaining waste.

That night, I tell Emma I need to check on a suicidal patient. Another half-truth. I kiss her goodbye, promising to text when I'm heading home. She squeezes my hand, tells me I'm a good man. The irony isn't lost on me.

I break into Mitchell's house through the side door after he's asleep. It's disarmed. Amateurs always think gates are enough. He's on the couch, shirtless, whiskey bottle loose in one hand, some reality show still playing on his massive television. I chloroform him in six seconds flat. Duct tape his mouth. He doesn't even twitch when I inject the paralytic—a cocktail of drugs from my medical supplies that will keep him compliant but conscious.

Getting him to my car is the riskiest part. The neighborhood has cameras, but I've studied the blind spots. I wrap him in a tarp, securing it with bungee cords, and use a collapsible hand truck to move him. To any observer, I'm simply moving a rolled carpet. In twenty minutes, we're driving toward my office building.

The medical complex is quiet at 2 AM. I use my key card to access the rear service entrance, where a loading dock connects directly to the basement. The security cameras I installed myself loop footage from the previous week during certain hours—a precaution I implemented years ago. I wheel Mitchell through the service corridor and into the basement area marked ""Private Storage."" Beyond that door lies a room unknown to my colleagues, my landlord, even the building inspector who approved my renovations—I called it a ""records vault"" on the plans.

Mitchell wakes up twelve hours later in the basement of my office building, tied to a steel chair bolted to the floor. He tries to scream. Tries to beg. I wear the suit. Rubber apron. Double gloves—nitrile under butyl rubber. Safety goggles. And the mask—a full-face chemical respirator, dual-filter, air-sealed. I always wear it when *The Need* eats.

The basement doesn't look like a place for therapy. It looks like a lab. Stainless steel counters. Industrial sink with an emergency shower station. A dedicated ventilation system disguised as part of the building's HVAC. Two high-density polyethylene barrels rated for chemical corrosion. Smaller containers of various chemicals. A commercial-grade bone grinder labeled as ""document destruction equipment"" in the purchasing records. Everything meticulously organized.

I work methodically. First, I document his injuries to the waitress. Make him confess. Record it. Not as trophy but as justification. *The Need* requires this—a ritual of judgment before execution.

The disposal will take nearly three days. I've learned this. Bodies are stubborn things. I start by sedating him more heavily. Death comes peacefully—a mercy he doesn't deserve. Then I begin the process that will consume my nights and early mornings for the next several days.

I drain the blood first, through a femoral catheter into the specialized drain system. Next comes dismemberment—clinical, precise cuts with a bone saw. I section him into manageable pieces, categorizing by tissue type. Soft tissue goes into the barrel containing hydrofluoric acid. The bones require special attention—they'll go into the second barrel with a stronger solution.

HF isn't flashy. It doesn't bubble and hiss like in TV shows. It's worse. It's quiet. Colorless. Soaks into tissue and starts eating calcium. Destroys from the inside out. You don't feel it until it's too late. Like guilt. Like rot.

I work in shifts. Three hours before dawn, two hours after my last patient leaves. I maintain my appointment schedule during the day, nodding sympathetically at patients' problems while my hands still feel the phantom weight of bone saws and chemical containers. Between appointments, I slip down to check on the progress, to add more chemicals, to stir the barrels with a specialized rod.

The office layout works to my advantage. My private entrance allows me to come and go unnoticed. The ventilation system I installed vents through filters that neutralize all odors before releasing air through an exhaust that appears to be part of the building's normal systems. The basement stays locked. The key card reader shows only my legitimate entries during business hours.

By the third day, Mitchell Harper has been reduced to a dark, viscous fluid. I filter it through specialized screens, catching any remaining bone fragments. These go into the grinder, becoming dust that I'll later mix with concrete and pour into small molds—paperweights that will eventually be dropped into different bodies of water across three counties.

The liquid waste goes down the drain in carefully measured amounts, mixed with industrial-grade neutralizers and diluted to avoid detection. Nothing rushed. Nothing obvious. I've studied chemistry for years to perfect this process.

After each session, I shower in the small bathroom adjacent to my office—installed years ago for ""patient privacy."" I keep spare clothes in my office closet. I arrive early each day, before Jeanine or any patients, to check on the progress downstairs. I leave late, after everyone else has gone. To anyone watching, I'm simply a dedicated doctor, working overtime.

I take his tie. Silk. Navy blue with silver stripes. That goes in the trophy drawer in my office, hidden behind false paneling in my filing cabinet. Jeanine thinks it's where I keep sensitive patient files. In reality, it holds seventeen ties. Seventeen monsters. Seventeen times *The Need* has been fed.

On the fourth day, I dismantle everything. Clean every surface with bleach, then ammonia, then specialized enzyme cleaners that destroy blood proteins. I wear different clothes, different shoes. I dispose of all used protective equipment in dumpsters across the city. The respirator and apron go back into a locked cabinet in the basement, after being thoroughly sanitized.

That night, Emma's already in bed when I return home just past midnight. She's curled on her side, blonde hair pulled into a loose bun that's coming undone at the nape of her neck. A few strands catch the amber light from her reading lamp. She's deep into some mystery novel she picked up at the airport last week—the kind with an unreliable narrator and twist ending she'll forget by next month. The room smells like lavender lotion and that expensive linen spray her sister gave her for Christmas. Domestic. Safe. The kind of life people envy on Instagram.

I slide under the blanket beside her, still feeling the phantom weight of rubber gloves on my hands. My skin smells like industrial soap despite three thorough washings. She doesn't say anything at first. Just turns a page, the paper sound crisp in the quiet room.

Then her hand finds my thigh, warm through the thin cotton of my pajama pants.

""You're home late,"" she says, not looking up from her book. Not an accusation. Just a statement.

""Crisis with the Harper case."" The lies come so easily now. ""Had to document everything properly. Legal stuff.""

Emma dog-ears her page and sets the book on the nightstand. ""The wife-beater?"" she asks, her voice carrying that slight edge of disgust she reserves for my more unsavory patients.

""Ex-wife-beater,"" I correct automatically. ""He's... was... in recovery.""

She shifts closer, her hand moving slowly up my thigh. It's mechanical at first. Like clockwork. She knows the rhythm now—how I come home quieter on certain nights. How my eyes don't track hers. How I'm still somewhere else.

""You carry too much of their darkness,"" she whispers, her lips close to my ear. Her hand moves higher, fingers tracing the waistband of my pants. ""Let me help.""

She thinks it's stress. Work. Patients. She's not wrong.

*The Need* is quiet, but it still echoes after a feeding. It leaves a vacuum that has to be filled with something—noise, touch, friction. A distraction. Without it, the images would flood back. Mitchell's eyes as they widened in recognition. The precise angle of my incisions. The slow dissolve of flesh in acid.

Her fingers slip beneath the elastic. ""Tell me about your day,"" she says, like we're making casual conversation over dinner. Her palm is cool against my skin.

I don't feel pleasure the way others do. There's no heat behind the eyes, no butterflies in the gut. Just pressure. Tension. And then, briefly, release.

""Routine,"" I lie, my voice steady despite her touch. ""Staff meeting ran long. Jeanine's complaining about the new billing software.""

Emma's grip tightens slightly. Deliberate. Practiced. ""And the new patient? The one you mentioned yesterday?""

Her strokes begin slow, rhythmic. Up, twist, down. She knows exactly how to touch me after fifteen years of marriage. The perfect pressure. The precise speed.

""Narcissistic personality disorder,"" I manage, my breathing carefully controlled. ""Classic case. Blames everyone but himself.""

She chuckles, her breath warm against my neck. ""Like your mother?""

I almost laugh. ""Worse. At least she admitted she was cruel.""

Emma's pace quickens slightly. Her technique is flawless—firm without being rough, the occasional teasing slowdown, the perfect amount of friction.

""You're tense tonight,"" she murmurs, her lips ghosting over my jawline. ""What's on your mind?""

Images flash—syringes, chemical burns, the sound of bone saw against cartilage. I push them away.

""Bills,"" I say instead. ""Lucy's dentist appointment on Thursday. Max's cough that won't go away.""

""And your mother calling too often,"" Emma adds, smiling against my skin. Her hand never stops its rhythmic movement.

""And my mother calling too often,"" I echo, a practiced smile forming.

She twists her wrist in that way she knows drives me wild—or would, if I could feel things properly. I make the appropriate sound anyway. Timing is everything.

""Remember when we first met?"" she asks, her voice dropping to that husky register she uses only in bed. Her grip tightens, her pace quickens. ""How shy you were? You couldn't even look at me when I took my clothes off that first time.""

I remember. I was calculating how to appear normal. How to react the way a man should when faced with desire.

""You've always been so good to me,"" she whispers, her movements becoming more purposeful. ""So patient. So... controlled.""

She has no idea how controlled. How every reaction, every sound, every facial expression is carefully calibrated to appear authentic.

""Em,"" I whisper, using the nickname I know she loves. I reach for her face, tracing her cheekbone with my thumb. Another calculated gesture.

""Tell me what you want,"" she says, her hand moving faster now. Her nightgown has slipped off one shoulder, revealing the pale skin beneath. I focus on that patch of skin—a physical detail to anchor me in this moment.

""Just you,"" I say, the words empty but effective. ""Always you.""

She smiles, pleased. Her hand alternates between long, slow strokes and quicker, tighter ones. Professional. Efficient. The physical response is building—a purely mechanical reaction.

""Lucy said the funniest thing today,"" Emma says, maintaining the ordinary conversation even as her hand works beneath the sheets. ""She told her teacher that you cut people open for a living.""

I tense involuntarily. Emma misinterprets it as pleasure.

""Kids,"" I manage to say. ""No filter.""

""Mrs. Peterson was horrified until Lucy explained you're a psychologist, not a surgeon."" Emma laughs, a light sound that doesn't match the increasingly urgent movements of her hand.

I force a chuckle. ""At least she didn't tell them about my basement office.""

The irony almost makes me genuinely laugh. Almost.

Emma's rhythm becomes more insistent. ""You close?"" she asks, her voice breathy.

I nod, not trusting my voice. The physical release is approaching—not pleasure exactly, but a cessation of tension.

She slips under the blanket without warning, her mouth replacing her hand. Warm. Wet. Perfect technique.

""Emma,"" I say, because I know she expects it. My hand finds her hair, tangling in the loose strands. I calibrate my breathing to suggest mounting pleasure.

From beneath the covers, her voice is muffled. ""Let go, baby. Just let go.""

If only she knew what would happen if I actually did.

As the physical release approaches, I close my eyes. Not from pleasure, but to concentrate on maintaining the façade. The sounds. The movements. The appropriate level of tension in my muscles.

""I love you,"" I say at precisely the right moment. Another lie that sounds like truth.

And when it's over, her head emerges from beneath the blanket, hair tousled, lips swollen, eyes seeking approval. I give it to her with a smile that crinkles the corners of my eyes just so.

""Come here,"" I whisper, pulling her against my chest where she can't see my face, can't notice how quickly the performance fades from my eyes.

She nestles against me, satisfied with her power to soothe me, to bring me back from the darkness she thinks is only work-related stress.

""Feel better?"" she asks, tracing patterns on my chest.

""Much,"" I lie, kissing the top of her head.

*The Need* is silent now. Not gone. Just... satisfied. For now.

Emma falls asleep quickly, her breathing deep and even against my side. I stare at the ceiling, calculating how many days until Mitchell Harper's dental records will be fully dissolved, how long before the last traces of him disappear from my basement lab.

As if reading my thoughts, Emma murmurs in her sleep, ""You're a good man.""

I hold her closer, wondering if good men keep trophies in their desk drawers. If good men know the precise temperature at which human bones become brittle enough to grind into dust.

If good men feel nothing at all.",1,1746625485.0,Review,0,1.0,False

I was grieving since the beginning of course  but was always numb-ish or deep down in denial.,"I was busy/exhausted with work, the weekends I would wake up grieving or sad with flashes of her next to me with vivid images of us in our old bedroom I might cry a bit, then get on, or maybe jump onto online dating chasing dopamine or whichever hormone. Once or twice I couldn’t almost breathe then screamed/cried into a pillow. But on the Christmas just gone a bit more than a year after the breakup I came to the clear vision of what I was missing (I was avoidant/felt trapped during the relationship) and all these ‘hot’ women I was dating or talking to, meant absolutely nothing in comparison (My ex was/is hot but more a messy hair, no make up, dungaree type of person, which I love/loved, very unshallow and in touch with nature). And I asked about 3 times to meet for a coffee, she had suggested it earlier in the summer when she was away and said she missed me but then we never did. And since had gotten slightly distant, but that slight distance has felt huge. Maybe she’s slow to grieve too and now in the anger stage. But sorry, I don’t know why I’m talking about all that, just giving a background, maybe it helps see why I’m so behind in the grieving. ",1,1746625461.0,BreakUps,3,1.0,False

I had tried everything—fad diets, personal trainers, detox juices, intermittent fasting—and nothing worked. I always failed. I felt trapped in a body that no longer represented who I was. Until one day, I made a real decision to change and dove headfirst into the **ketogenic diet**. It was an intense, transformative, and far from easy **60-day journey**.

# 🥑 What I Ate

In the beginning, my meals were full of **healthy fats** and **almost zero carbs**. Carbs became my sworn enemy. My fridge turned into a shrine to ketosis.  
Here’s what I ate every day:

* Eggs (lots of eggs!) in every possible form
* Avocado with olive oil and salt
* Grilled chicken with butter
* Ground beef with cheese
* Salmon, sardines, and other fatty fish
* Cauliflower, spinach, broccoli, and zucchini
* Yellow cheese, heavy cream, and nuts
* Black coffee with coconut oil (the famous bulletproof coffee)
* Lots of water and green tea

No bread, no rice, no pasta. And worst of all: no chocolate or that warm buttery French roll I used to crave on rough days.

# 💥 The Challenges (and there were plenty)

The first **7 to 10 days were hell**. I had headaches, dizziness, irritability, fatigue. I was sweating just watching people eat cake. It was the notorious ""keto flu""—my body adjusting to burning fat for energy.  
Some days I cried. Some days I almost gave up. Some nights I dreamed about pizza.

But I didn’t stop.

Over time, something amazing happened: **mental clarity**, reduced hunger, and a lightness in my body I hadn’t felt in years. The scale started to drop, but more than that, I began to **see myself differently in the mirror.**

# 🏋️‍♂️ Working Out – Slowly but Surely

At first, my body could barely handle light walking. But slowly, I added:

* Daily 30–40 minute walks
* Light bodyweight exercises (squats, planks, push-ups)
* Weekend bike rides
* Morning stretching

It wasn’t easy. Many times I felt tired before even starting. But I kept going—**on pure determination and hope**.

# ✊ From Victim to Victor

For so long I saw myself as a victim—of my metabolism, my anxiety, my routine, my genetics. Always blaming something. But in these 60 days, I learned that **no one is going to fight for me if I don’t fight first**.

This wasn’t just a physical change—it was mental, emotional, and personal.

Did I lose weight? Yes.  
Did I gain confidence? Absolutely.  
But most of all, I **took back control of my life**.

If you're thinking about starting—just do it. It’s going to hurt, it’s going to exhaust you, but it’s going to be worth it.

I used to be into the hobby (Flip- going back 30 years now!) and built a few dioramas, including one nice one inside a glass topped coffee table - It had 3 inch (roughly) deep sides and was about 3 feet diameter, so I built a nice 'N' gauge layout into it.  I couldn't afford any engines or rolling stock ( I had a basic set of a couple of engines and rolling stock in HO, but the N gauge track was cheap and I made my own models to go into the table, ending up with a sadly empty but nice looking table (IMO anyway!)  

I finished it at art college as part of a project and loved building it- At that time, I had this little dream of doing that sort of thing for a living, building full, easy to maintain sets with meaning to the person commissioning it into big old wooden desks or whatever.  

The ultimate though would have been a room or even  multi-room sized setup running under a glass floor-  Inspection and maintenance panels built in somehow, and personalised to the life of the owner, IE you grew up in an area, so the set would feature landmarks, stations and even your own house/street as a prominent feature!  I reckoned it would be a high-end, boutique type business appealing to rich people with offices who were still young at heart.  

Never took it any further than just being an idea, a fantasy, but If I won the big lottery win, I think it might well be the sort of thing I'd try out for myself.  Naww, who am I kidding, I'd have so much to do with the expeditions, bikes, cars and travel that I could fit into the rest of my life, I'd commission a couple of young model makers to build it for me!

  
I know the glass floor thing is feasible, but I'd love to know of any setups that exist like this, and any links I can follow to gawp at would be welcome!

Kendu Energy is an energy drink company spearheaded by a chad called Mike, there are others that help him with distribution, like a chad called Sam Synth, who deals with American distribution. Kendu Energy currently has 2 different types, full sugar and sugar free, this ensures that Kendu Energy is inclusive to those who avoid sugar. Kendu Energy has recently changed their box, which was designed by StaySeaArt and MrWhite. I have personally tried the full sugar Kendu Energy and would heavily recommend it to everyone.

**Kendu Games**

The team making this consists of ex Bioware and AAA game developers. Leadership has committed a portion of net profit after tax back into Kendu. Some portions will be put into the Community Treasury and others into the Kendu Games Treasury. This will be very beneficial at growing Kendu's price steadily, whilst making us more stable. Some details have been released and the main character is called Kippa with a companion calld Yuni. This game will be released on Steam and I am very excited.

**Some Comments**

All of these products are being created by average holders, with very creative ideas. Kendu is decentralised and there is no ""team"", this is very important because it shows how dedicated Kendu's community is and this is all being done at 12 million market cap!!! I can guarantee plenty of other products are in the works and some maybe sidelined until people's Kendu bags go up in value, there is gonna be a surge of products being released as Kendu booms past ATH and into the billions. All of these products push Kendu significantly forward, retail will love IRL products because it gives a product something physical. No other coin has come close to what Kendu has accomplished IRL and we are still so cheap, Kendu is gonna skyrocket and you should position yourself accordingly. Die hard communities always win and Kendu is not an exception

1kgxfqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Deivissonluiz/comments/1kgxfqw/my_60day_keto_journey_between_struggles_and/,My 60-Day Keto Journey – Between Struggles and Triumph,"# My 60-Day Keto Journey – Between Struggles and Triumph

Honestly, I never thought I could do it. I had tried everything—fad diets, personal trainers, detox juices, intermittent fasting—and nothing worked. I always failed. I felt trapped in a body that no longer represented who I was. Until one day, I made a real decision to change and dove headfirst into the **ketogenic diet**. It was an intense, transformative, and far from easy **60-day journey**.

# 🥑 What I Ate

In the beginning, my meals were full of **healthy fats** and **almost zero carbs**. Carbs became my sworn enemy. My fridge turned into a shrine to ketosis.  
Here’s what I ate every day:

* Eggs (lots of eggs!) in every possible form
* Avocado with olive oil and salt
* Grilled chicken with butter
* Ground beef with cheese
* Salmon, sardines, and other fatty fish
* Cauliflower, spinach, broccoli, and zucchini
* Yellow cheese, heavy cream, and nuts
* Black coffee with coconut oil (the famous bulletproof coffee)
* Lots of water and green tea

No bread, no rice, no pasta. And worst of all: no chocolate or that warm buttery French roll I used to crave on rough days.

# 💥 The Challenges (and there were plenty)

The first **7 to 10 days were hell**. I had headaches, dizziness, irritability, fatigue. I was sweating just watching people eat cake. It was the notorious ""keto flu""—my body adjusting to burning fat for energy.  
Some days I cried. Some days I almost gave up. Some nights I dreamed about pizza.

But I didn’t stop.

Over time, something amazing happened: **mental clarity**, reduced hunger, and a lightness in my body I hadn’t felt in years. The scale started to drop, but more than that, I began to **see myself differently in the mirror.**

# 🏋️‍♂️ Working Out – Slowly but Surely

At first, my body could barely handle light walking. But slowly, I added:

* Daily 30–40 minute walks
* Light bodyweight exercises (squats, planks, push-ups)
* Weekend bike rides
* Morning stretching

It wasn’t easy. Many times I felt tired before even starting. But I kept going—**on pure determination and hope**.

# ✊ From Victim to Victor

For so long I saw myself as a victim—of my metabolism, my anxiety, my routine, my genetics. Always blaming something. But in these 60 days, I learned that **no one is going to fight for me if I don’t fight first**.

This wasn’t just a physical change—it was mental, emotional, and personal.

Did I lose weight? Yes.  
Did I gain confidence? Absolutely.  
But most of all, I **took back control of my life**.

If you're thinking about starting—just do it. It’s going to hurt, it’s going to exhaust you, but it’s going to be worth it.  
**I’m living proof.**

I suffer from tinnitus (ringing in ears) and I never paid attention to the fact that coffee and caffeine in general can worsen it. However, I decided that it would be best for me to cut all the caffeine out.

The thing is, I *love* the taste of real coffee. I did not find any alternative which would satisfy the coffee craving yet, so I was thinking: what coffee alternatives are folks out there drinking? 

I'm looking for some more niche and unhinged tips. For example I recently learned that dried dandelion roots are supposed to taste like coffee, so something in that sense! :)",1,1746624577.0,diet,3,1.0,False
1kgxdqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/movingout/comments/1kgxdqu/feeling_guilt_about_moving_out_without_telling_my/,Feeling guilt about moving out without telling my parents,"Hi, I don't know if this is the right subreddit but I think it's the closest I can get lol. I'm 19(f/nb), and I have plans to move out in almost exactly a month. Currently I am living with my parents and four other siblings. I don't plan on telling my parents that I'm leaving, and going while they and my younger two siblings are on a family trip, and I'm feeling really guilty about it, but I wouldn't be able to leave any other way. 

before I get into everything (it's a long one) I'm asking advice on: managing the guilt of essentially running away, first time renting/moving tips, and how to maintain a mid-distance relationship with my sister who is stuck with my parents.

I'm planning on leaving in the middle of June, I'm moving in with my BF of three years (20m) and another friend V (19f). I have a decent paying job, and by moving in with my BF and V I'll be closer to my job than I currently am, saving me money on gas. Rent is about $975/m (most utilities included) divided by the three of us so the absolute most I'd be paying a month is $400. I'm also taking my cat with me, which is making me nervous because she's an indoor/outdoor cat, and she's going to have to be more of an indoor only cat where I'm moving to (I have plans to get her a catio but I currently live on a farm, so a catio will probably seem kinda small to her lol).

I feel really bad about leaving without my parents knowledge/consent, but they would throw a fit the whole time, and if they knew I was moving in with my BF (without getting married) they would put me on house arrest (they're christian, and I don't want to get married yet, and they don't want me dating him in the first place let alone marraige because he's not christian). 

I have four siblings, the older two are going to be married and moving out in the next year (the oldest is actually moving out in 2 weeks). I feel most bad about leaving my younger sister (17) here with my emotionally inept parents, and a youngest brother (15) who is violent and just like my dad. I'd be missing out on living with my sister for her senior year of highschool, and i've considered staying for her last year, but issues with my parents have been esculating in a bad way in the last couple months, and I don't think I could make it through the summer, let alone a whole year living with them anymore. It's alot of them hounding me over what I'm doing with my life (I stopped going to college after one and a half semesters because I hated the program) and i'll tell them ideas for what I want to do, (go to a trade school, keep saving until i find a degree that i like, anything really) but they shoot it down and say it isn't good enough, which i assume is because I denounced my christianity a few years ago, and put my foot down about not going back to church when I came home from college, and have since made sure I have work every sunday so they can't force me to go. 

The guilt is currently eating me alive, I've told my younger sister that I plan on leaving, not where or when because she wants plausible deniablity. I know she's a tough girl, she doesn't blame me for leaving, and it's only a year until she goes to college anyway, but I still feel bad leaving her, and not being able to do the things we do (movie nights, coffee runs, etc) for her senior year. I know it's possible to still do these things, but I have a feeling that once I'm out, I'm not going to be welcomed back, and she doesn't have her drivers license yet. 

I'm really scared about my parents possibly making attempts to bring me back home, especially if they find out who i'm living with. I'm going to leave my sister a note with my address on it, incase she ever needs a place to go, but my parents are nosey, and even though i'm moving 30 minutes away, I don't know if it's far enough. I have plans for when I'm 21 to move to Wyoming (currently in Ohio), but that's two years from now. I don't want to have to get a restraining order from my parents, I love them alot, and I know it's going to break my mom's heart, but I cannot live with them much longer.

sorry for the long post, it's been alot weighing on me that I cant tell anyone I know for sake of my parents finding out about all of this. Advice on how to manage the guilt, things I should know as my first time moving out, and ideas for how to still make my sister's life livable with my parents is greatly appreciated!

He had 4 weeks off with me when our son was born and then his life returned to business as usual. Not much in his life has changed, gets to take a nice long shower in the morning, grab his coffee on the way to work, work his 8 hours, grab lunch with coworkers everyday, then drive home. By this point he has about an hour and a half until our son goes to sleep, so not much left but one diaper change and one feeding and he goes right down.

Meanwhile I’m at home with the baby all day, struggling to take a shower, getting in and out 2 to 3 times cause the baby cries. Trying to get out of the house when i can but its hard with planning around naps and feedings and sometimes he throws fits in the car seat. Carrying the full mental load of everything for our son and the house. Meanwhile he gets to do his whole day without a second thought.

Okay so, I know not a lot of you commented on my post, but I think I still needed to update the few people who cared enough to respond. Thank you for all of that.  
And as a reminder, English isn't my first language

So, following me kicking Keven out, we decided to meet up and chat two days after he was out. It was very hard on both of us, but I really though I was doing it for the best. We met up, and talked about issues in our relationship and how we could resolve some of them and how we can satisfy each other's needs better.

It was a very much needed talked, and Keven stayed out the house for an entire week. I saw friends, I bought a new TV table, tried to not think about him when he was out. I was reflecting on things he wanted me to correct and I was hoping he'd do the same. My only demand was that I wanted one evening a week, just us two, no friends, no family, just us and our cat.

So Keven came back after a week of being out. The first day was awkward, obviously, but nothing too crazy. That week was beautiful, we got our evening, that ended up being only sharing a meal while watching Pocahontas, sitting on the couch.

During that week, taxes form had to be filled out asap because he was stressed out about it, so we agreed to do them with my parents, after a funeral he had on Saturday. Keep in mind, Keven agreed to go eat dinner after this at my parents' so we can use the evening to fill out tax forms. He was the one stressing out about it time wise.  
  
Saturday comes around, I decided to show that I cared and I brought him for breakfast at the restaurant, hopefully to calm his nerves for the upcoming funeral during the day. I steamed his shirt and everything, because on prior agreement, I wasn't going to be present for the funeral. I went through a lot of losses as a kid/teenager and funeral homes put me in a weird spot. Nonetheless, I was going to make an effort and just go and show my respect to the grieving family. Everyone was very understanding.  
  
And so I did, I went and showed my respect then went back home.  
  
After a while, my mom was reaching out to me to know when we were going to come, because she knew we wanted to fill our forms. So I reached out to Keven, trying to get information about his plans after the funeral home. Keven responded at 4pm that he was going to get some bites with the family and then join me so we could do our taxes. We then agreed I was going to wait for him at home.

4:45pm comes by and Keven announces he just got to the restaurant for the bites. I politely told him that, since my parents eat dinner early, I would go there instead. He got somewhat upset and quickly joined us at my parents'.

While we're there, he sends me a message about how his parents are super offended he had to leave and that I was apparently controlling. I started feeling bad at my own parents' house, so I told everyone I was tired and that I would go home.

I cried the entire way back in the car, Keven not understanding. We got home, he went straight to his PC, and I quickly left to go see my sister because I couldn't take it anymore. On my way to her, Keven's dad sends me a message about how I am too intense and too attached to my past. I asked him if I could see him and talk, because in my mind, there's was no way I was going to get insulted from a man who shouldn't be meddling in his son's life in the first place.

After showing the texts to my sister and somewhat calming down, I decided to go home and talk to Keven. He was also waiting for me so we could talk.

Cue a crying discussion. Keven accused me of ripping him out of his family today and forcing him to come to my parents' place when I never did that. I apologized, saying I was sorry he misinterpreted my messages. Keven told me that I should know that people gather for food and or drinks after funeral homes. I told him he was bold to assume everyone does that. My family never did that, but I never wanted him to leave so fast. He then started a speech about how I have a house because I have money and a pretty decent job and that's how I have this house.

Mind you, and I reminded Keven that, I bought my house after saving for only 6 months, on a poor salary of $16/hour at a fast-food chain. I since changed jobs, but my actual job isn't the reason I got this house. I had nothing prior to those 6 months.

Keven accused me of never letting him go out and how he doesn't go because of my past relationship and how he doesn't want me to think he's cheating on me. I told him that my past boyfriend wasn't going out, he was in his boxers, on the couch and insulting me freely when playing online with his friends. The though of Keven cheating on me never crossed my mind, because I believed in his loyalty. He accused me for not being there for this recent grief he was facing and I asked him where the fuck was he when we lost OUR baby back in December? Where was he?

Our talk goes in circles, and to my surprise, my sister shows up to my door. When she enters, she looked at me directly and apologized for showing up late (it was maybe already 10:30pm or something), but she was worried because I wasn't answering her messages. She just wanted to make sure I was safe. I quickly told her that it was fine, me and Keven were talking, hence why I wasn't answering. My sister kneeled down to the floor, my cat now asking for her attention, and she starts petting it. She calmly said, her eyes locked on my cat, that we are both adults and that talking calmly will help us resolve our situation. That we both have our issues and faults, and that it's totally fine.

She left, and I then realize Keven was up, and that he had backed up in the living room, phone in hand. He tells me he was about to call the police on my sister. EXCUSE ME?

Cue the worst words I got. He proceeds to tell me our relationship can't go anywhere. That he loves me, but that I am so different since the miscarriage. so is he. That he can't do it anymore.

He dumps me at 11:15 or 30 pm that Saturday. My first reaction was to tell him that, okay, then he must understand that he won't be sleeping in MY bed. And that for work tomorrow, he needs to find his own lift to get there, because he is nor my boyfriend, nor my son. And that I wanted his shits gone ASAP, because this is MY house and he isn't welcomed here.

You would think the story ends there, he got his stuff out and we went no contact. I blocked him everywhere and yaddy yadda.  
STRAP IN FOLKS.

Insert petty revenge here.

Remember Alex?  
welp, last time Alex was over for the weekend, he had a private talk with Keven. I know Alex offered his bestfriend ways to improve his mental health, because gaming together was becoming too heavy on him. Alex stated that their relationship cannot go forward if Keven continues to act this heavily and brutally. Context, they usually play FPS together, that's how they met.

Well, turns out that when Alex left, Keven told me how he couldn't believe his bestfriend came over for the weekend just to insult him and tell him he's toxic and yappy yapp.

So I told Alex exactly that when Keven dumped me. Two days after.

Alex thanked me, and I was surprised. He apparently knew something was up since he last came over, and he thanked me for giving him the closure he needed. Alex doesn't want anything to do with Keven again and will meet up with him in the future to thank him for the few years of friendship, but it was over.  
Alex will be cutting ties with Keven, but became a gaming buddy for me, my sister and her fiancé.

Lost a boyfriend, Gained a friend.

Ever since the breakup, some people have been kind enough to inform me of things being said in my back about me. I then learned how Keven is going around town to tell his friends and everyone how he never wanted kids, he wasn't ready to be a father. His dad is also berating me around town. And since it's a small town, it's only a matter of time before EVERYONE knows.

An old friend of mine reached out to me to tell me that Keven's father told her we weren't together anymore and she found it odd that he was the one spreading the news.  
Comes April 24th, were I started noticing that my usual coffee had weird effects on me.  
BEHOLD, I learned in the afternoon after work that I was pregnant with Keven.

Came a lot of frustration and fear, because I wasn't planning on it being true and I absolutely didn't know what to do. I quickly spread the news around my friends and my family, absolutely scared of the future and what decision to make.

A little less than a week later, I let Keven know. Precising that my choice between keeping it or not wasn't made. He got immediately defensive, saying he didn't want it, he didn't deserve it, how he couldn't understand how I'm maybe considering keeping it and how I should live this adventure with someone who truly loves me. Oh and that he could be there for the abortion if I needed him to.

HUGE SLAP in the face for me. It really felt like he implied he never loved me, how our 3 years relationship was just a joke to him. I rudely declined his offer about the abortion, because if I do chose that, I don't want him near mem, my mom is going to be more than enough.

Side note too, why would he care to be present for me for an abortion when he never was there for me to grieve our miscarriage?

He did however called me later that day to apologize for his behavior and that the decision is truly mine and that he would be present on my own terms if I decide to keep it.

Welp, as of day of posting, yesterday I was ready to meet up with him this week to discuss how we go forward in the future, because I had all the intentions of keeping this part of me. Then, someone informs me on how Keven's dad is telling everyone I would never be a good mother. I politely asked Keven via text if his dad could stop insulting me around town when my family has been very civil about the situation.

Keven berated me, saying that he never wants news from me ever again, he doesn't want to know anything about this pregnancy, this baby or my life ever again.

I answered good, because I just decided that I am not keeping this baby, because his family won't shut up about me and that I'll be protecting my baby from this hatred they'd grow up in.

So it's fair to say my choice is made. For the sake of this baby's safety and also mine, I will be aborting. I never wanted to experience the pain of loss again, but somehow, in the future, I'll be happy to have done it. My baby doesn't deserve to come in this world where half their family hates them for just existing.

My bestfriend and I are going out on Sunday, and she'll help me pick out a pyjama to go with the one my mom had picked out back in December, so both my babies will forever be together. I also immediately associate a necklace I have with two hearts pendant as my two babies. From now how, those babies will always be mine, and never his, because Keven never truly cared anyways, even for me.

I know I'm ending this post on a very dramatic note, but it is what it is. And I don't know if I'll ever be okay again.  
I don't think I'll ever update again.

**Chapter VII**

**Targets**


A few days later Astral was waking up, shuffling his way to the kitchen where the coffee was bubbling up, calling his name. Ukiko was in her work clothes and shook her head as he passed her looking like he had stepped out of a sitcom. 

“Rough night?” Ukiko chuckled.

“Was up till three talking with a client. He really thinks his wife is cheating and won’t take no.” Astral yawned. “Told him he needed to accept that maybe he’s got his own guilt to wrestle with.” Astral poured a cup and sipped the black liquid before he smiled and dumped in some sugar and cream.  “He didn’t like that.” 

“Doing anything big today?” Ukiko asked curiously.

Astral shrugged and stepped into the den and turned on the TV and turned up the volume a little. “Depends on if the Detective Finds something or if the others need my help.” He then sat at the counter and sipped the coffee slowly.

“Can you make breakfast for Ariane then, make sure she studies?” Ukiko asked, “Craig hasn’t responded to my texts.”

“Craig?” Astral looked at Ukiko. “Immersion therapy?”

Ukiko nodded, “It’s been working, she loves Craig as a babysitter.”

Astral snorted and shook his head. “He is weirdly endearing, like the girl herself.”

“He’s been playing scrabble with her and teaching her a ton of words.” Ukiko smiled, “Try not to spoil that, okay?” 

Astral smirked, “I don’t know what you mean.” 

“Your favorite words are almost exclusively four letters in English.” Ukiko said with a light huff. 

“Don’t worry. She’s with me today. I’ll let you know if we go anywhere.” Astral nodded and then stood up and got to work on making breakfast for himself and Ariane. 

Ukiko waved as she left and Astral picked out some hash brown patties and toaster pastries to go with the eggs he was about to scramble. Once he started cooking the eggs Ariane wandered out of her room in her pajamas and sat at the kitchen table with a happy yawn and smile.

“Good morning.” Astral greeted her. “Sleep well?” 

Ariane nodded. “The ghost mamas are still out.” 

Astral snickered to himself. The ghost mamas were a small group of onryo women that Ariane could call on to defend her. They would harass and obliterate anyone who tried to harm her, even if they had to wait for the girl to leave before they did it. Astral had seen them only a few times watching over her as he read to her at night, they didn’t perceive him as a threat, but they weren’t always happy with him, sometimes punishing him for doing something wrong. That had stopped fast when Ariane got upset when one had caused him to trip into a wall and crack his head open. Now he just gave them their space and they did the same for him, but he had to feel sorry for the schmuck that provoked their response.

“Well, I’m sure they’re helping some other kid.” Astral said, not really believing it himself.

He sat a plate full of hash browns, eggs with a toaster pastry in front of the small girl.

“Maybe, but most other kids can’t see them.” Ariane smiled as she began to dig into the eggs.

Astral grabbed his own plate and sat next to Ariane and began to eat. He was about halfway through when he saw Ariane was mimicking his movements once again. He chuckled and winked at her and she winked back. 

“So, got any plans today? Running off to help another young man?” Astral asked.

Ariane shook her head. “Taro needs some time and no one else is missing people.” Then she paused, “Not like he was anyway.” 

“You can tell how they’re missing them?” Astral asked.

Ariane nodded, “I can’t really explain it.” 

“Fair enough-” Astral paused as he heard the TV mention Detective Saitō by name and precinct.

He got up and went into the den. He watched in horror as the scrawl at the bottom of the screen read, “Homicide Detective Slain in Office. No leads.” He felt his knees hit the ground and Ariane was holding his shoulder. 

“I’m here.” Astral patted her hands. “Go get dressed.” 

“You know him?” Ariane asked then corrected herself, “Knew him?” 

“I was working with him.” Astral nodded. “Finish eating, get dressed. I gotta do the same.” 

Ariane nodded and dashed back to her chair. 

Astral stood up and went back to his room to grab his phone. Messages had been left on his voice mail by the Precinct’s captain. He listened, the man wanted to talk to him, of course, and Astral was going to see what happened anyway. He got dressed as quickly as he could, then returned to his half eaten meal and quickly scarfed it down before Ariane came back out in a blue dress with her jacket. He smiled as he stood up, picked her up and headed out. He dialed Ukiko as he grew his wings and felt Ariane hold tight to his neck.

**(\o/)-(\o/)-(\o/)**

Astral landed and several officers noticed him. One approached him and bowed, Astral barely recognized him as the officer that had directed him to Misao’s office.

“Sir, we know why you’ve come. The captain is fully willing to come to you. You don’t need to...” The officer stopped as Astral shook his head.

“I need to.” Astral grumbled and nodded to Ariane, who was still in his arms. “Could you keep an eye on this one while I go talk to the Captain?” 

The officer nodded as Astral put her on the ground. Then he offered his hand to Ariane.

“We have some coloring books.” The officer offered.

Ariane just watched Astral walk towards the doors and disappear through them. Then she waited for the officer to turn his back and she was through them just as fast.

Astral never noticed the small girl following him, and he made his way to the second floor and just briefly passed the corner office where Misao Saitō once worked his cases. There was no body, but he paused as he saw the deep red stain against the wall. A hole the size of a small orange mixed in with the blood and gore. The sight didn’t disturb him as much as the ease with how it seemed to have happened. Then he shook himself back to focus and walked to the Captain’s office. The man was outside of it tapping a cigarette nervously against his hands. 

“Captain Jin?” Astral asked, he had never met the man, but Misao was always complaining about him when they worked together. Thankfully it was always the complaints of an old work buddy.

Captain Han Jin nodded, “Mr. Freiheight, you look more affected than I expected.” 

“Work with someone on a case, you get to know them. Detective Sai...” He shook his head. “Misao was a good man, blunt, but good.” 

“He was.” The captain sighed, “And I have to tell his family something. I’m hoping you know something that can lead to a suspect.” 

Astral sighed and shrugged. “No offense, but how did this happen?” 

“Delivery man walked in and used the package as an ad-hoc suppressor.” The Captain sighed, “We have video, but we found a latex mask in the garbage outside.” 

“Did he suffer?” Astral asked.

“No, but he seemed to know something was coming. We think he hid something in his office. Likely his notes.” Jin explained, “Video shows him moving stuff around before the delivery man showed up, he didn’t fight back and he knew.” The captain rubbed his weary eyes. “This was a professional, we know that.” 

Astral sighed and stepped back for a moment where he bumped into a small frame that latched onto his legs. He turned and looked down to see Ariane looking up. 

Captain Jin leaned around to see the girl and shook his head, then he shouted at his officers. “Who let this child in!?”

“She’s with me, Captain.” Astral squatted down. “What’s wrong?” 

“You’re sad and I can help.” Ariane pouted.

“Ari...” Astral hugged her.

“This your daughter?” Captain Jin asked.

“Yeah...” Astral patted her on the head, “Can’t really say otherwise now, can I?” 

Ariane smiled. “I can help!” 

“Ari, I don’t want you in there.” Astral said as he gently bumped his forehead to hers. “It’s not something you should see.” 

“What’s she talking about?” Captain Jin asked.

“Ari can interact with the dead.” Astral said.

“Ah, definitely not something a kid should see.” Captain Jin said.

“SIR!” A detective waved over to the captain, “I got something on the Garage camera! I think it’s the suspect’s face!” 

Astral snapped to attention with the Captain but just as quickly looked back to see Ariane scampering off towards the office. Astral gave a huff and took after the girl.  He ducked past the tape barrier that she just avoided by her height alone. When he finally stood up in the office he was looking straight into a dense fog. He moved towards the back and watched for Ariane’s head, spotting her staring at the bloody patch on the wall with a distressed expression. He carefully picked her up and was about to speak when movement caught his attention.

A replica of Misao, made of the fog itself, moved and animated itself lifting and moving things. The replica seemed frustrated and angry at something before it finally scrambled to his chair and pulled up the arm and slid something into the metal tube of the chair before putting the arm back on. Then he seemed to relax before his door opened and a second form entered, there was a moment of silence before the Fog Misao spoke.

“I know who you are. I know what you are.” Misao’s voice echoed as the room itself seemed to cry.  

The sound of a supressed shot echoed as the Fog Misao jerked.

Ariane cried out and Astral held her close and rushed out. Not even noticing the room was now drenched in a mysterious rain. He sat her down outside and held her close. Shouts alerted him to approaching officers.

“What is this?” An officer shouted.

“Did the sprinkler system go off?!” A detective shouted. 

“Mr. Freiheight!” Captain Jin approached and looked at Ariane, “Did she do this?” 

“She’s my kid, you got a problem with her, you come to me.” Astral said with his tone like steel. “End of discussion.” 

“Well that’s all the evidence gone.” Captain Jin snapped.

“Not all of it.” Astral said as he sat Ariane down. “Stay here.” He patted her head and she whimpered but nodded.

Astral stepped into the office with the Captain, “Her powers let her replay events. I saw his last moments from inside the office. He knew who his killer was and he did hide something.” 

Astral pulled the chair over and wrenched the arm off the side, a rolled up series of notes were still inside, dry as a bone. Astral slowly pulled them out and walked back out to the Captain’s office, picking up Ariane on the way. The Captain followed, mildly confused and befuddled. Inside the office he put Ariane in a chair and unrolled the notes on the Captain’s desk. 

“This doesn’t make any sense.” Captain Jin sighed, “Except that...” He pointed to a phrase and sighed.

“Smiles, Murder for Hire.” Astral shrugged, “I don’t follow underworld stuff.”

“Seriously?” Captain Jin sighed, “He’s the most wanted assassin in the world.” 

“Number 7, GLOBAL, in all caps?” Astral paused, “Isn’t that a myth?” 

“Conspiracy theory is more like.” Captain Jin said.

“His name is Charlie.” Ariane said, “But he goes by Smiles. He prefers it.” 

Astral paused. “Ari, was that the other guy in the fog?” 

Ariane nodded. “Charlie Smith.” 

“Is that a fire symbol?” Captain Jin was focused on the notes. “And why the Number 7, three different ways?” 

Astral pulled his phone out and took a few pictures of the notes.
 
“Hey!” The Captain snapped. 

“You want my help, I’m looking into this too. He was a friend, believe it or not.” Astral said, “I got some theories, but you don’t want to know them.” 

“Why?” Captain Jin asked. 

Astral eyed the document, “Because then you’re a target.” 

Captain Jin blinked and looked back as realization dawned on him. “Okay, You have what you need we’ll follow the leads we do have.” 

“Did you get his face?” Astral asked.

“No. Clever bastard knew the camera was there, put on a hoodie and waved.” Captain Jin growled, “Mocking us every step of the way.” 

Astral grunted as he picked Ariane back up. “We’re heading home now. If you have specific questions, it might be better to come see me there.” He handed the Captain a card with his home address on the back. 

“Of course.” Captain Jin nodded, “And I’m sorry she had to see that.” 

Ariane sniffled and waved, “He liked this place. It was like home. He felt like he belonged here the most.” 

Captain Jin nodded with tears welling in his eyes.

“Come on Ari, let’s go home.” Astral left as Ariane turned and waved goodbye to the captain.

**(\o/)-(\o/)-(\o/)**

Astral walked in carrying a still upset Ariane. Ukiko was sitting at the counter, already in more relaxed clothes and immediately took the small girl into her arms and hugged her.

“Oh, how do you feel?” Ukiko asked as she hugged the girl.

“Sad. He wanted to work with papa Aster.” Ariane said, “But the bad man took him away.” 

“Papa Aster?” Ukiko arched an eyebrow.

“Might as well get used to it, I ain’t giving up caring for her.” Astral shrugged as he pulled out a bag of microwave popcorn. “You two get comfy on the couch, I’ll make snacks. You two pick the movies.”

“What?” Ukiko blinked.

“Ari’s had a rough day. So we’re unwinding with her.” He looked at Ukiko, “Unless you have a better plan.” 

Ukiko paused for a moment, then shook her head. “Just go light on the butter.” 

“Blasphemy!” Astral snorted. “I can’t believe I’m hearing this!” 

Ukiko rolled her eyes as she walked into the den and sat down. Ariane then slid into the middle seat and laid her head on Ukiko’s lap. Ukiko grabbed a small brush and began to brush the girl’s hair, singing a light tune. 

“I like the song.” Ariane muttered.

“My mama sang it for me.” Ukiko smiled.

“Can.” Ariane paused and shifted, “Can I call you mama?” 

Ukiko hugged the girl tightly, and nodded. “He’s right about that. We won’t give you up without a hell of a fight.” 

Ariane smiled and hugged Ukiko back. “Can we watch the _Island of Trains_?” 

“I’m not familiar with that one...” Ukiko pulled out her phone as Astral walked in and took the seat on the opposite side of Ariane.

Astral held a bowl of popcorn and shook his head. “Such disrespect not to butter popcorn.” 

Ukiko giggled, “Do you know The Island of Trains?” 

“It has Thomas!” Ariane laughed.

Astral froze, “The books, the old series or the new one?” He asked cautiously.

“New series!” Ariane exclaimed.

Astral gave a relieved nod and Ukiko just tilted her head. He gave a concerned look at Ariane and nodded to the TV. Ukiko rolled her eyes yet again, but turned on the TV and found the series. She was delighted to find it a wonderfully charming show about anthropomorphic trains on an island with stories about working together and good behavior. She did note Astral seemed nervous about watching it, but largely ignored it as Ariane seemed to love the series. 

Dinner finally rolled around and Astral went out for a pizza. When he got back he decided on a movie to watch and introduced Ariane to the movie _Flubber_. She spent more time giggling in that hour and a half than she had the whole day, but she was still sad when the robot was destroyed. Then about half way through the movie _Hook_ she fell into a deep sleep. Astral carefully picked her up as Ukiko paused the movie.

“We’ll save that for later.” Ukiko smiled, “So why the worry about trains?” 

“The old book series.” Astral chuckled as he handed Ariane to Ukiko to change her into her night clothes. 

“What about them?” Ukiko asked.

Astral pointed to Ariane’s room and motioned to the den. Ukiko nodded as she changed the girl into her pajamas and opened the door. Astral stepped in and gave Ariane a good night peck on her forehead. Ariane mumbled something about the ghost mamas and briefly reached out for a hug that Astral provided before he stepped into the hall. Ukiko joined him after she too said her good night to the small child. 

Astral walked back to the den and sat down as he picked up the remote. Ukiko joined him and picked up the popcorn bowl and picked at the remains.

“So, the old books were about, pretty much the same thing as the show.” Astral smirked, “Except it was in the apocalypse.” 

Ukiko’s eyes went wide.

“All those stories have a different tint with that knowledge now, don’t they?” Astral chuckled. “Old show at least tried to hide it. Same with this new one, but damn is that a thing to learn.”

“Oh joy.” Ukiko laughed. “So what else is available?” 

Astral skimmed the options. “Oh, Planet of the Tomatoes, 2032 edition.” 

“That sounds dumb.” Ukiko snorted.

“Rip off of an older movie.” Astral shrugged. “Not as good, but they actually tried to make it serious.” 

“How do you know this stuff?” Ukiko asked.

“We didn’t have the most up to date entertainment where I was brought up.” Astral sighed, “Mostly we entertained each other. Older kids watched out for the younger ones. Jess always had to act like the big kids.” 

Ukiko listened and nodded.

“But she also made sure we had good stories to listen to or watch. She stole more old movies than any kid in the neighborhood, that includes the kids who did nothing but do that.” Astral laughed, “God, I miss her.” 

Ukiko nodded in understanding. “We had a kid in our class growing up. He’d get into fights at the drop of a hat. Ended up working for my dad out of junior high. Went with him to avenge my mom. But he always had a good reason to fight.”

“Sounds like a decent guy, maybe made a few bad choices. I assume he didn’t make it.” Astral asked.

“I don’t know. Dad can’t be sure of who’s souls he’s made of and Daisuke wasn’t one to run normally, but those weren’t normal situations.” Ukiko sighed. 

“Sounds like he was at least somewhat of a friend.” Astral said with an inquiring tone.

“Yeah, we may have even dated if he hadn’t gone with my dad and everything went to hell afterward.” Ukiko sighed, “He was a good man, Astral, like you are. Please don’t get yourself killed because you see a just, but hopeless cause.” 

Astral nodded. “That’s like asking the sun not to shine. I’m not saying I’d jump in front of a truck to save a kid, I got wings and a brain, but I protect people. I help them find what’s lost...” He paused and looked towards Ariane’s room. “She’s right, I guess I’m a hero, of sorts. Angels, nephilim, we do things for hopeless causes. Especially if they need it. Doubly so if they’re just.” 

Ukiko sighed and leaned back. “Great to hear.” 

“Hey, I’m not gonna try and die.” Astral snorted, “Far from it, if I’m going into something ‘hopeless’ it's to prove there is hope, to be that beacon. Because sometimes...” He smiled to himself. “Because sometimes that’s what people have lost and they just need a hand to remember it.” 

Ukiko chuckled, “Where did you get that one?” 

“Parent’s videos.” Astral smiled, “Old man was fond of those cheesy lines. But he wasn't wrong.”

Ukiko exhaled and stood up. “I’m going to take a shower and crash.” 

“Already had my shower today, courtesy of Ari.” Astral laughed, “But I feel that.” 

They both went to their rooms and Astral quickly drifted off to sleep, only barely aware of hearing the water running from the bathroom. 

**(\o/)-(\o/)-(\o/)**

Astral awoke the next morning to pounding on the door. He shot up and slipped his coat over his shoulders and went to answer the door. Lucifer brushed past him with a look of fury stoked by not enough sleep and too much coffee. Astral slowly closed the door as he watched his friend and mentor.

“You’re not okay.” Astral said.

“No.” Lucifer snapped, “I’ve lost a brother. You know what I’m feeling. And now the police are reporting that they have leads and it’s because the officer that was investigating is dead! What happened?” 

“He got close to the answer.” Astral said. “Whoever put it all together wasn’t happy. He knew it was coming.” 

Lucifer paused, then winced in anger and pain. “Filthy apes! Greedy monkeys! Do your kin know nothing of kindness! Is there nothing of love, brotherhood?! Or is it greed all the way down, greed and power! Don’t tell me I’m wrong, I know the answer!” He shouted and paused once again as Ariane stood in the hall, rubbing her eyes.

“Luci, don’t you like us because we are full of love?” Ariane yawned as she wobbled forward and gripped his leg.

Lucifer seemed to deflate and Astral rushed up and helped him sit in a kitchen chair. Lucifer gripped his shoulder and sighed, defeated, as he looked down at Ariane and hugged the girl. 

“I’m sorry Ari. I’m hurting right now. I’ve said quite a few things, I shouldn’t have meant.” Lucifer whimpered.

“I know.” Ariane hugged his leg tighter, “We can have tea.” 

Lucifer smiled and looked up at Astral. “I would like that, if I could.” 

Astral nodded. “I’ll put a pot on.” 

Lucifer sighed and leaned back. “I apologize, _achi_, my outburst was wrong.” 

“Brother?” Astral blinked, “Not what I expected.” 

“Half you may be, you are still mal'akh, and still amongst us.” Lucifer smiled, “Youngest and most troublesome you may be.” 

Astral smirked, “Yeah, but you love me.” 

Lucifer laughed, “I wouldn’t say quite that, but you have your charms.” 

“Well.” Astral put the pot of water on the stove. “Good news is I’m still looking into the case. The precinct captain pretty much handed it to me.” 

“You’re making yourself a target?” Lucifer frowned.

“Whoever killed Misao, killed your brother and I’m almost certain they’re a revenant.” Astral nodded.

“We can be bad?” Ariane frowned.

“Anyone can be bad.” Astral said, “Or good. It’s about effort and morals and how you put yourself into others' shoes.” 

“Don’t put yourself in mine, they're more expensive than your wardrobe, minus the coat.” Lucifer smiled.

“Did I hear shouting?” Ukiko walked out in her robe and saw Lucifer sitting at the table. “Hello Lucifer.” She wanted to glare, but could only stare in concern.

“My apologies, my grief has gotten the better of me.” Lucifer bowed his head, “Ariane was offering to help make my day better.” 

“Tea!” Ariane smiled, “Want some?” 

Ukiko nodded and sat next to Ariane at the table. Astral pulled down four mugs and put a tea bag in each before the pot whistled and he poured the boiling water into each cup. Then he served the tea with a sugar dish and sat with his friend for a bit to help him get his head on at least a little more straight than it had been.

1kgx2tv,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1kgx2tv/does_10x_health_system_vitamin_d3_k2_review_prove/,Does 10X Health System Vitamin D3 K2 Review Prove Effective for Bone Health?,"The 10X Health System Vitamin D3 5000 IU & K2 MK7 high-potency supplement has been a recent addition to my daily routine, and I’ve been eager to see how it stacks up. With all the buzz around the crucial role of Vitamin D3 and K2 in supporting bone, heart, and teeth health, this compact supplement caught my attention. Manufactured in the USA and gluten-free, it’s marketed as an effortless way to fortify your diet with two essential vitamins. After spending some time integrating it into my day-to-day, I’ve gathered plenty of thoughts—both good and bad—worth sharing.

**Efficient Design for Convenience**  
The capsule design of this supplement is a huge plus for someone like me who doesn't enjoy choking down multiple tablets, powders, or liquids. Each capsule is compact and easy to swallow, which matters more than it should. The packaging itself is practical and compact, slightly smaller than a deck of cards. I appreciate the portability as it fits neatly in my cluttered medicine cabinet or in my backpack on a hectic day. The unflavored nature of the capsules was another relief—there’s no odd aftertaste that lingers. It's a straightforward, no-fuss product, which I know many will value as a ""set it and forget it"" supplement.

**Positives**  
- Combines Vitamin D3 and K2 for enhanced calcium absorption and redirection to bones.  
- Convenient, easy-to-swallow capsule format without added flavors or sugars.  
- Gluten-free and suitable for broader dietary needs.  

[Check 10X Health System Vitamin D3 B0D5ZSTFM1 price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b0d5zstfm1/)

**Performance in Daily Routine**  
The combination of Vitamin D3 and K2 seemed to make a noticeable difference in my energy levels within the first few weeks. Sitting at a desk all day often leaves me stiff and sore, and while I wouldn’t claim this supplement cures stiffness, it genuinely seemed to help with general wellness and mobility over time. Its biggest selling point for me is its ability to enhance calcium management in the body. I paired this supplement with my morning coffee (after checking if caffeine would interfere—thankfully, no issues). Since including these capsules, my joints—especially my knees—feel less cranky, which I attribute partially to better calcium absorption. 

**Targeting Heart Health and More**  
The supplement also touts cardiovascular benefits, and although I don't have clinical proof from my personal experience, I appreciated the peace of mind it brings. With the way it prevents calcium buildup in arteries, the long-term potential for heart wellness feels like a strong positive. Honestly, who doesn’t enjoy a multi-tasker? It feels like a safeguard pill for anyone juggling a stressful life, trying to eat better but not perfect, or simply aging and needing proactive measures.

**Drawbacks**  
- While the capsules are easy to swallow, I did experience slight bloating on certain days.  
- The effectiveness may vary based on individual absorption rates, something you should monitor.  
- It’s unflavored, yes, but the capsule coating still has a faint medicinal scent that might bother sensitive noses.  

**Competitors**  
I did some digging into alternative products in the Vitamin D3 and K2 supplement market to better evaluate this one. Two popular competitors are the Nature Made Vitamin D3 and the Life Extension Super K. Compared to the Nature Made option, the 10X Health System supplement wins hands down in combining D3 and K2 into a single capsule for more comprehensive support. Nature Made supplements tend to focus solely on D3, leaving out the K2 that plays a critical role in directing calcium where it belongs. On the other hand, Life Extension Super K does provide multiple forms of K vitamins, but it doesn’t focus as much on D3 potency or the same highly targeted benefits for bones and heart health. What ultimately sold me on this 10X Health option was its balanced potency—125 mcg Vitamin D and 90 mcg Vitamin K2—and its user-friendly daily dose.

**Money’s Worth**  
Determining whether a health supplement is worth its price can be tricky. While the market is flooded with cheaper alternatives, I’d argue that the blend of high-grade D3 and K2 here, along with the assurance of quality testing, justifies the cost. Unlike bulk discounts of questionable quality that pop up in every corner of Amazon, this supplement delivers exactly what it says with no hidden fillers or suspicious claims. That adds a lot of value for me because I’m not looking to gamble with my health.

Finally. After a week of intense work, the idea of happy hour with my lifelong friends both excited and intimidated me. I couldn't wait to unwind, laugh, and feel like myself again. But there was also that knot in my stomach, that feeling that something unsaid, something unconfessable, hung in the air between us.

""Girls, tonight we gossip!"" exclaimed Giulia, the most daring of the group, as we settled at our table at the bar. Her eyes sparkled with a mischievous light. ""I have some... spicy news.""

""Spill it, Giulia, don't keep us in suspense!"" replied Francesca, always the most direct.

Giulia leaned in, lowering her voice. ""Remember Marco, Sara's new colleague? And... let's also say Paolo, his friend... Well... let's just say we've become 'friendly' in a... very interesting way. The office has never been so hot, and neither has my bed, lately.""

Sara blushed slightly but didn't deny it. On the contrary, an enigmatic smile curved her lips. ""Giulia has always been good at creating... multiple connections.""

I looked at them, feeling a strange mix of excitement and unease. There was something unsaid between them, a palpable tension that went beyond simple friendship. I felt excluded, but at the same time intrigued. What was really hidden behind their knowing glances?

The evening continued with laughter, cocktails, and veiled allusions. Every so often, I felt Giulia's eyes on me, as if trying to gauge my thoughts. I felt increasingly restless, eager to get home to you.

The thought of you washed over me as I drove home. I imagined your hands on me, your warm breath on my neck, the taste of your kisses. I had a physical need for you, to feel you close, to share every detail of that evening, not so much because of the events themselves, but because of how they made me feel.

As soon as I crossed the threshold, I found you in the kitchen, busy preparing something. The smell of food mingled with the aroma of the prosecco you had already opened.

""Hi, love,"" you said, turning to me. Your eyes shone with an intense light. ""How did it go with the girls?""

""Good... but I need to talk to you,"" I replied, approaching you. I felt my heart pounding.

You hugged me, holding me tight. ""I figured. I felt you were agitated.""

I pulled away, taking your hand. ""Come on, let's sit down. I need to tell you everything.""

As I told you about the evening, the glances, the allusions, I felt desire growing inside me. I couldn't take my eyes off you. Your every word, every gesture, fueled my excitement.

""And then Giulia said..."", I continued, but my voice broke. I felt my cheeks burning.

You came closer, lifting my chin with your fingers. ""What did she say, love?""

""Nothing important... just... girl stuff,"" I replied, looking down.

""Girl stuff... or things that made you think of us?"" you whispered, your voice husky and sensual.

A shiver ran down my spine. ""Maybe a little of both,"" I admitted, my breath coming faster.

You drew me closer, your lips just inches from mine. ""And what exactly were you thinking about?""

""You,"" I replied without hesitation. ""About how much I missed you. About how much I want to feel you inside me.""

Your lips met mine in an intense kiss, full of desire. The taste of prosecco mingled with ours, as your hands slid down my sides.

""I've wanted you too, every minute of this evening,"" you murmured between kisses. ""I imagined your hands on me, your body against mine...""

You lifted me into your arms, carrying me towards the bedroom. ""I want tonight to be just for us,"" you said, your eyes gleaming with passion. ""I want to make you feel how much I love you, how much you drive me crazy.""

And that night, between the scented sheets and our intertwined bodies, every thought, every unspoken word, turned into an explosion of pleasure and love.

...

""I have to tell you about Giulia,"" I said the next morning, as we had breakfast. There was still a trace of shyness, but also a strong excitement, as I thought back to the night before.

""What's so interesting about Giulia?"" you asked, raising an eyebrow, but with a mischievous smile.

""She... she confessed something last night. Something that... shook me.""

""Tell me, I'm all ears.""

""Well... she said she was with Marco and Paolo... at the same time.""

I saw you swallow, your expression changing. ""At the same time?""

""Yes. She said that at first she was scared, but then... she discovered that the double penetration... that feeling two men inside her... was incredibly exciting. She used some... very explicit words.""

You looked at me, your eyes shining with an intense and unexplored light. ""And this shook you... in what way?""

""In the sense that... I had never thought about it. But hearing her talk... made me imagine... us.""

You took my hand, squeezing it tightly. ""Us?""

""Yes. You and me. Together. With someone else. Or maybe... just you... in a... different way.""

I felt my heart pounding as I spoke those words. It was the first time I had expressed such daring fantasies. But I felt that with you I could be completely myself, without filters, without fears.

You smiled at me, a smile that made me melt. ""I like it when you talk like that, love. You drive me crazy.""

""So,"" you said, putting down your coffee cup and tilting your head slightly, your eyes searching mine with intensity. ""Tell me more about what Giulia said. I want to understand *exactly* what made you... snap.""

I felt my cheeks flush under your penetrating gaze. ""Well... she talked about the feeling of fullness. Of feeling... possessed in a total way. She said that her body responded to... new, unexpected stimuli.""

""Fullness,"" you repeated, savoring the word. ""Possessed... in a total way. Does the idea of feeling like that excite you?""

I swallowed, unable to hold your gaze. ""Maybe... a little. I don't know. I've never thought about it in those terms.""

You came closer to me, your voice a husky and seductive whisper. ""But you're thinking about it now. And what exactly do you imagine? I want to hear your words, Claudia. I want you to be... filthy with me.""

Your invitation sent a shiver through me. I had never expressed myself so explicitly, not even with you. But I felt it was time to let go, to explore the desires I had kept hidden for too long.

""I imagine... your hands on me,"" I began, my voice trembling but determined. ""Not just where they're used to going. I want to feel you... everywhere. I want you to fill me, to make me feel yours... in every possible way.""

""In every possible way,"" you repeated, a predatory smile curving your lips. ""I like this, Claudia. And what exactly would you like me to do, to make you feel mine?""

I licked my lips, feeling desire take over my shyness. ""I want to feel you inside me,"" I said, the words coming with difficulty from my lips. ""I want to feel your hardness... fill me completely. I want to moan your name... until I lose control.""

""Lose control,"" you said, your eyes burning with passion. ""Is that what you want me to make you do, Claudia? Lose control?""

I nodded, unable to speak. Your gaze, your words, had completely captivated me. I was yours, in that moment, ready for anything you wanted to do to me.

You got up, coming to sit next to me. You took my face in your hands, kissing me with a fervor that took my breath away. ""You drive me crazy, Claudia,"" you whispered between kisses. ""I want to make you scream my name. I want to brand you. I want you to never forget who you belong to.""

And that breakfast, which had begun with a simple confession, turned into an fiery prelude to a day and night of unbridled passion, in which every limit was surpassed and every repressed desire finally satisfied.

...

""There's more,"" I said, my voice trembling slightly. ""There's something that... that I've never dared to ask you.""

You looked at me, an eyebrow raised, but with an expression of intense curiosity. ""Tell me everything, love. Don't hold back.""

I took a deep breath, my heart pounding. ""I want... I want you to fuck me in the ass.""

The words came out in a rush, freeing me from a weight I had carried inside for too long. Your gaze didn't change, but I felt a jolt of excitement run through my body.

""Fuck you in the ass,"" you repeated, your voice deep and husky. ""And what makes you want this, Claudia?""

""Giulia,"" I replied without hesitation. ""She described the feeling of... of fullness, of feeling completely filled. She said it's a... different pleasure. A pleasure that I want to experience too. With you.""

""And that's not all, is it?"" you urged, your hand moving to my thigh, caressing it slowly.

""No,"" I admitted, my face on fire. ""I also... I want you to spank me. I want to feel like a cat in heat... who can't stop her need to cum. I want you to punish me... for being so good until now.""

You smiled, a smile that promised fire and flames. ""Oh, Claudia,"" you whispered, your voice full of desire. ""You're much more perverse than I thought. And that excites me to no end.""

You got up, making me stand up with you. You turned me around, positioning me in front of you, and looked me in the eye. ""Are you sure about what you want, love? Because once I start, I won't stop.""

I nodded, tears in my eyes, but not of fear, but of excitement. ""Yes, Ettore. I want this. I want everything.""

And so, that morning, our breakfast turned into a wild and passionate exploration of our most hidden desires. Every limit was broken down, every taboo shattered, and our love pushed into unexplored territories, where pleasure and passion merged into a single, unforgettable experience.",1,1746623516.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

On Sunday we had a date that was unexpectedly cut short (neither of us was truly enjoying the event we went to so we left) but then he said he'd drop me off right then (we had only been together for maybe an hour tops) cause he needed time for himself and I felt bad and told him so. 

He's needed to take time for himself before, which is very reasonable, and in the beginning he didn't know how to communicate that, he would just disappear for the day and not reply to my texts and only let me know what's going on after I called him and he didn't answer and I texted saying I was worried but also pissed, so we agreed everytime he needed sone alone time he would let me know and all would be well. This happened a few times, him communicating his needs and me giving him space. But on Sunday it hit me differently because he had never needed time alone while ALREADY BEING WITH ME I felt like it wasn't him needing ""alone"" time more like him needing ""away from me"" time, he said it wasn't like that, we had some back and forth, but at the end he said all would be well and it was just for a day and he'd text me the next day. So he dropped me off.

Monday came  but no texts did, I was thrown cause he had even texted me the night before after dropping me off (showing and telling me about his dinner) so I assumed he would maybe text later during the day. He didn't. I texted him as usual (good morning, a funny meme here and there, a text suggesting we could have a quick coffee in the evening) but nothing. I took some time to reflect and truly came to my senses and regretted my reactiin from the day before so Monday night I wrote him a text to apologise and promise I'd take the necessary steps to keep it from happening again (I've reached out to a therapist to help me work on my anxiety) but my text remained unopened.

Tuesday morning I texted him again (good morning, say I love him, wishing a great day), still got no reply but he did open the chat at around noon, though I'm unsure whether he did read any or just opened and closed the chat. I called him at around 4, hoping I'd at least prompt a text from him letting me know if he needed more alone time, but he didn't answer nor text anything at all. I sent a quick voice message saying I'd like to know how he's doing, no pressure, that I love him, miss him and would appreciate to know if he needs more time for himself so I can give it to him.

If gotten no response and my texts have remained unopened. Today I just sent him a quick message (good morning, saying I love him again, wishing him a great day) and don't plan to send anymore.

WIBTA if I show up at his place tonight and ask him to talk? For context when he's needed alone time it's never been more than a day without him talking to me. I know my anxiety instantly makes me assume the worst, but the last time we did talk he said we'd be fine and he'd text me. I've consulted with my best friend who's faced similar situations before in her relationship and she says it's been too long. I also feel like it's been too long (not for him to be alone but for him to not let me know what's up).

His personality type is INFJ though, so idk. Also this worries me as I've read aabout the ""door slam"" in INFJ's (he recommended I should read up on his personality type as he said it would help me understand some parts of him better, and it did).

It took me a good while to realise, that I felt even lonelier when I was with people who were bad or simply not able to consider me as the traumatised person I was.

Over a year ago I had a big waking up, by meeting a person who despite being toxic as hell, helped me find my inner child. It was painful, I was never more afraid.
But now I am truly in touch with myself, and the past feels like a distant memory. I know fully well what happened, and how horrible it was, but it has no hold over me anymore.

I don't chase those people anymore that I expected to give my life value. I don't run away from those dark nights full of pondering. I eat breakfast every morning. I take time to be myself.

And today I woke up in my new flat, all alone, feeling truly free for the first time in my life. I got MY furniture coming in tomorrow. I hang MY pictures on the walls. I'll buy MY coffee set tomorrow. And I now trust myself to take responsibility for my inner child, no matter how much more fallout comes my way.

Its like I just started living for the first time! Don't give up, even if you're standing on that bridge like I did, even if your whole family watches you being abused and only your mother is left to love you: there is a way, even if you can't see it. I'm glad I didn't end the life of that child inside of me.

That is clear.  However, I can’t help but notice how many people are not really doing what it takes, even in good market, to secure a decent job (ignore 2021-2022, those were anomalously good years, and likely won’t happen again in the near future).


What I’ve seen:

1. Not searching for internships the summer/fall *before* the summer you want to intern.  I literally had someone ask me IRL a few days ago, about my company’s intern program that literally starts next week…. They were focusing on schoolwork apparently in their fall semester , and started looking in the spring.

2. Not applying for new grad roles in the same timeline as above.  Why did you wait to graduate before you seriously started the job search?  

3.  Not having projects on your resume (assuming no work xp) because you haven’t taken the right classes yet or some other excuse.  Seriously?

4.  Applying to like 100 roles online, and thinking there’s enough.  I went to a top target, and I sent over 1000 apps, attended so many in-person and virtual events, cold DMed people on LinkedIn for informational interviews starting my freshman year.  I’m seeing folks who don’t have the benefit of a target school name literally doing less.

5.  Missing scheduled calls, show up late, not do basic stuff.  I had a student schedule an info interview with me, no show, apologize, reschedule, and no show again.   I’ve had others who had reached out for a coffee chat, not even review my LinkedIn profile and ask questions like where I worked before.  Seriously?

6.  Can’t code your way out of a box.  Yes, a wild amount of folks can’t implement something like a basic binary search.

7.  Cheat on interviews with AI.  It’s so common.

8.  Not have basic knowledge/understanding (for specific roles).  You’d be surprised how many candidates in AI/ML literally don’t know the difference between inference and training, or can’t even half-explain the bias-variance trade-off problem.


Do the basic stuff right, and you’re already ahead of 95% of candidates.

Back in 6th grade so yeah, there was a guy in our class who just straight-up refused to do anything. No homework, barely participated, just always off in his own world. This wasn’t even the end of the year either, it was like September. Barely halfway through the first semester and he was already drowning in missing assignments.

Our teacher who was pregnant at the time finally told him he wasn’t going to pass if he kept slacking. It wasn’t even harsh, it was her basically telling him hey you're fucking slacking please turn in assignments.  This sadistic motherfucker puts hand sanitizer in her coffee and I had came late to class so I didn't know. 
 

She drank it. Started throwing up immediately. They had to call in the nurse and everything. Whole class was just sitting there in shock while she was being helped out.

And the wildest part? He only got suspended. Like... a month. That was it. Not expelled. Not charged. Nothing.

We were kids, so we didn’t really grasp how serious it was at the time, but looking back as an adult? That could’ve gone very bad, especially with her being pregnant. And nobody even talked about it after. It was like it it didn't happen but she left in December

I then went in again to buy another coffee (I really like coffee), and presented my used paper cup (very very recently used) and was told that they can't accept it. Then they crudely put the used one (including lid - surely that could've been reused?) in the bin and got a new one whilst making me feel so uncomfortable acting as if I was being a nuisance.

Even if that is the policy, fair enough, but the girls serving me were just waiting for me to walk out so they could roll their eyes at me. I felt weirdly humiliated even though I didn't make a scene or even question them, all I said was 'oh right, I have done it before' not in an annoyed way at all, I totally accepted the situation. I was mildly confused at worst. 

I have re-used a paper cup at this exact train station at least two times that I can think of. There was never a problem so I'm just wondering if that person was bending the rules or if the girls I encountered today just didn't want to touch my 'dirty' cup or something.

Picture it: a vibrant newsletter that highlights everything great about our community, showcasing local businesses and weaving stories that draw us closer. That's right—a hyper-local print and digital newsletter packed with the flavor of the neighborhood!

First, let’s talk about the treasure trove of local businesses just waiting to be discovered. We’ve got the cozy coffee shop down the street, where the barista knows everyone's name and the muffin selection is basically a form of art. We could dive into their story—how they started, what keeps them going, and maybe throw in a fun anecdote about the infamous “white chocolate mocha incident” from last year. 

Imagine using engaging prose to paint a picture of that hidden gem of a bookstore that smells like nostalgia and often hosts the quirkiest poetry readings this side of the Mississippi. We could interview the owner, share their journey, and encourage readers to step inside and maybe leave with a paperback or two—which, let’s face it, is the heart of any good adventure.

Next, let’s make room for community input. Maybe a section where neighbors can share their stories too—kind of like a “you speak, we listen” corner. This could feature inspiring tales, humorous mishaps, or even shout-outs to random acts of kindness they experienced. Think of it as the digital corner of your best friend’s living room, where cozy conversations unfold over hot chocolate.

Now, onto the ads. Local businesses pouring their hearts into their work deserve more than a passing mention. We’ll offer a dedicated space where they can shine. Monthly specials, events, and even behind-the-scenes glimpses can fill those pages! After all, when everything feels interconnected, it's like a giant spiritual knot tying us all together in this tapestry we call community. 

We can't forget the whimsy of telling stories that tug at the heartstrings. Each piece could carry a theme—like “Faith in Action” or “The Spirit of Entrepreneurship”—allowing us to connect and reflect deeply on what it means to thrive together. 

And let’s not skip over the digital aspect. Create an online platform where people can resonate with the stories they read and interact with them. Maybe have polls, comment sections, and social media buzz generated from it, making each story feel like a team sport we’re all playing together. 

Hyper-local, intentional, and infused with a sense of community spirit, this newsletter could be the lifeblood of local storytelling—a place to come together, share victories, lift each other up, and yes, maybe even laugh at our collectively awkward moments. Power to the people, as they say! So, what are you waiting for? Let’s get those ideas flowing and start cranking out some magic, one newsletter at a time.",1,1746622933.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

**Economic Context:**
- The restaurant sector remains impacted by macroeconomic volatility, including inflationary pressures on commodity prices, particularly for eggs, bacon, coffee, and avocados.

- Ongoing marketing efforts aimed at building brand awareness and traffic growth, especially in new and emerging markets.

**Financial Outlook:**
- Adjusted EBITDA guidance lowered to **$114-$119 million** for 2025, partly due to unanticipated cost pressures and lower-than-expected in-restaurant traffic.
- The company anticipates **59 to 64 net new restaurants** for the year, with a significant portion of openings in the second half.

**Strategic Plans:**
- Focus on customer engagement through initiatives like the ""Surprise and Delight"" program, which drives customer loyalty but has added cost pressures in the short term.

1kgwqlo,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1kgwqlo/i_left_islam_2_years_ago_but_something_about_it/,"I Left Islam 2 Years Ago, But Something About It Keeps Haunting Me","Yo, Reddit, I need to get this off my chest. I'm 27, born and raised in a pretty devout Muslim family in [insert vague city for realism, like ""a midsize city in the Midwest""]. I left Islam about two years ago, and man, it's been a wild ride. I thought I'd be done with it-y'know, close the book, move on, live my life. But every now and then, something happens that makes me pause and wonder: Is there something to Islam that I'm missing? I'm not saying I'm going back, but... I'm confused, and I wanna share my story. Maybe some of you can relate.

Growing up, Islam was everything. Five prayers a day, Quran classes every weekend, Ramadan vibes with the whole community. My mom would always say, ""Islam is the straight path, beta. Stick to it, and you'll never get lost."" I believed it, too. I'd see my friends at the mosque, we'd joke about sneaking snacks before iftar, and I felt like I was part of something bigger. But as I got older-maybe around 18, 19-I started asking questions. Like, why are some rules so strict? Why does the Quran say one thing, but people interpret it a million different ways? Why do I feel guilty for just thinking about stuff like evolution or, I dunno, listening to music?

By the time I hit college, the doubts were loud. I was studying biology, and the whole ""Adam and Eve"" story started feeling like a metaphor, not history. I'd read about contradictions in hadiths, the historical context of certain verses, and stuff like apostasy laws that just didn't sit right. I'd lie awake at night, terrified I was gonna burn for even questioning this stuff. I tried talking to my imam, but he just said, ""Shaytan's whispering to you. Double down on your prayers."" That didn't help. It felt like I was being gaslit by my own faith.

So, two years ago, I made the jump. I stopped praying, stopped fasting, told my family I was done. It was messy-my dad didn't talk to me for months, my mom cried like I'd died. Some friends ghosted me; others tried to ""save"" me with dawah videos. I moved out, got my own place, and started building a life without Islam. I was free, right? I could drink if I wanted, date without sneaking around, listen to Kendrick Lamar without guilt. But freedom's weird when you're still carrying this baggage.

Here's the thing that keeps tripping me up: Islam feels different from other religions, and I can't shake it. Like, I've checked out Christianity, Buddhism, even some New Age spiritual stuff, but nothing hits the same. Islam has this... intensity, this pull. Maybe it's the way it's so all-encompassing-your diet, your clothes, your schedule, even how you sleep. Or maybe it's the community, the way everyone's so tight-knit (until you leave, lol). But it's more than that. It's these random moments that make me wonder if I'm wrong for walking away.

Like, last year, I was going through a rough patch -lost my job, broke up with my girlfriend, felt like the world was caving in. One night, I'm scrolling through YouTube, and I stumble on this old Quran recitation I used to love as a kid. It's Surah Ar-Rahman, the one about God's mercy. I don't know why, but I clicked play. Man, I bawled. It wasn't just nostalgia-it was like the words were speaking directly to me, reminding me of every good thing in my life. For a second, I felt... peace? Like maybe there's a God out there who actually cares. I didn't pray or anything, but I couldn't stop thinking about it for weeks.

Then there was this other time, a few months ago. I'm at a coffee shop, minding my business, when this old uncle-type guy starts chatting me up. He's got the classic beard and kufi, super chill vibe. We're just talking about life, and out of nowhere, he says, ""You look like you're searching for something, beta. Don't forget where you came from."" I swear, I never told him I was ex-Muslim or anything. It freaked me out. Was it a coincidence? Divine intervention? Just an old dude being cryptic? I don't know.

And it's not just these big moments. It's little stuff, too. Like how I'll catch myself saying ""inshallah"" when I'm hoping for something, or how I still feel weird eating pork (tried bacon once, felt like I was committing a crime). It's like Islam's wired into me, even after two years of trying to let it go. I've read Dawkins, Hitchens, all the atheist big shots, and logically, I'm like, ""Yeah, religion's a construct."" But then I'll hear the adhan on some random TikTok, and my heart skips a beat. What is that?

I'm not saying Islam's true. I'm not saying it's not. I'm just... stuck. I've got one foot in this new life-secular, skeptical, doing my own thing-and one foot still tethered to this faith I grew up with. I see posts on here about ex-Muslims who are all-in atheist or others who went back to Islam, and I'm jealous of their certainty. Me? I'm in this weird limbo. I don't pray, I don't fast, but I can't fully let go. Maybe it's guilt, or maybe it's something bigger. I don't know.

So, Reddit, what's your take? Anyone else feel like this? Like you left, but the door's still cracked open?

I've had suicidal thoughts and 0 motivation since I turned 16. I simply gave up on life and now I'm like a ghost on earth.

I suspect that it may be caused by a low testosterone level, and it would make sense because I'm not very masculine. I have a high pitched voice, little facial hair and I'm not very muscular.

So I tried for a few months to fix my life : I stopped drinking alcohol (I also never smoked), I cut sugar, I made more sport (cycling which is not very optimal), I exposed myself more to sun, I tried to sleep better and I started eating healthier food (red meat, eggs, fish, nuts, coffee, ginger, avocado, olive oil, oat etc...). I also tried to nofap but it's too hard for me.

I have been doing this for a few weeks because Tim Hortons is on the way to my work. I always order an extra large hot coffee with cream and vanilla syrup.

But I went again this morning and I was charged $1.25 again. This time I questioned it and told them their sign says it is $0.25. I was told that it is because I got 5 pumps of syrup and it is $0.25 per pump. I never specified an amount of syrup. I always just asked for vanilla syrup and they added it. I told them I didn't ask for 5 pumps and I shouldn't have to pay for the extra pumps. After a little back and forth they waived the cost of syrup for today.

Ever find yourself *dragging* by lunchtime? Like you could sleep standing up, dreaming of your bed instead of crushing your to-do list? Yeah, we’ve all been there. And honestly, who hasn’t guzzled down one too many cups of coffee, only to crash harder than a toddler after a sugar rush? 🙃

Let’s chat about a little trick I stumbled upon that takes literally **10 seconds**. You’d think I was about to reveal the secret to eternal youth, but it's even better for your productivity! 

**What’s the magic?** 

It’s all about the **power of breath**. Yeah, seriously! Just hear me out:

1. **Take a deep breath in.** Fill those lungs like you’re trying to smell every cookie in Grandma's kitchen. 🍪
2. **Hold it for a second.** Just long enough to count to one (or a slow “one-Mississippi” if you want).
3. **Exhale slowly.** Let all that tension flow out of you like that awkward dance move at a wedding when you think no one’s watching. 🎉

Repeat this a few times and voila! You’ve just given yourself a little spark of energy, minus the coffee jitters.

**But why does this work?** 

- **Reoxygenates your blood**: Your body is like a car – it can’t run on empty. Breathing deeply gives your organs the juice they need.
- **Reduces stress**: Say goodbye to that pesky heart-pounding anxiety about all the things you haven’t done yet. 
- **Boosts focus**: Feel like you're stuck in a fog? Clearing your mind will help sharpen your thoughts faster than a barista can make your Americano. 

So next time you’re feeling that mid-morning slump, try this ""breath hack""! Who needs another overpriced latte anyway? 

Let’s be honest—coffee can't do it all. And what I’ve noticed is that when I replace a caffeine fix with intentional breathing, I feel lighter and way more energized. Kind of like replacing a brick with a balloon, if that makes any sense. 🎈

I’d also get to know my teachers and they were fun. We’d usually have a connection- like they’d know me and I’d know them. I’d have conversations with them all the time. 

As I’m graduating highschool now.. I do feel a little scared for college and the things I’m reading seem very demotivating. I read about how lonely college is, and how it swamps you in too much work.. and I also read that it’s very isolating. 

I’m confused.. because I don’t know what I’m getting into. Obviously I’m not just there to socialize.. but I’m still curious as to what it will be like in that aspect or if it’s as exciting as highschool was- just to understand what I’m getting myself into vs what I’ve been used to for 4 years.

I’ve unfortunately experienced a lot of abuse in the past from my family and boyfriends and have been vulnerable to this. I’ve recently realised that I’ve overlooked behaviour from friends. 

Many years ago I had a male friend who I really got on well with. I’d often go hang out at his family’s house and became close friends with his sister too. 

One day after a minor disagreement, the male friend threw a heavy coffee mug at me in their family kitchen. I flinched and it hit the wall behind me; however it was intended to hit me. Me being me took complete responsibility for the moment and brushed it under the carpet and apologised to him I never spoke of it. Years later my male friend completely stopped talking to me. I reached out and was ignored each time and this was really sad for me for many years. 

I did however remain close with his sister and we got on really well. I considered her a best friend and we shared everything. 

Last year I experienced something very difficult in my life and facing a lot of challenges alone (I have no family). I have a few friends who have been great and check in with me to see how im doing; however she has not done this once. She has ignored my texts on a few occasions too and i ultimately feel like a burden or problem and if I am then I thought I’d at least like her to communicate this to me. I’m always happy for people to communicate anything to me. 

Ultimately I feel parallels with what her brother did to me all those years ago. This is a 20 year friendship and I feel disposable at a really difficult time. 

I guess I want to be a stronger person and appreciate the friendships that are supportive and compassionate. I feel like o want to delete her from my life. I wondered if that was childish ",2,1746621818.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

Let me briefly introduce myself and situation :

28 year old man, mixed-ADHD,  having trouble getting longer than 5/6.5 hours of sleep per night.

I'm currently under ritalin LP (and been there for almost a year).

The thing is I already tried a lot of ""obvious"" thing's to help me sleep better.

- avoiding late screentime
- getting sunlight early in the morning (or using a luminotherapy lamp during fall/winter)
- avoiding stimulants and coffee uptakes after 3/4 p.m
- practicing sport
-practicing auto- hypnosis
- eating ""healthy""
- taking melatonine to induce sleep faster
- taking ""long-lasting"" mild downers (only plant-based :Eschscholzia, valerian, passion flower in a sort of natural blend)
- avoiding sport 2 hours before bedtime

Honestly, I might be doing something wrong but I personnaly think my ADHD might just be comorbid about sleep and i'm kinda screwed on this.

I try to keep an open mind about it, even though I really feel that 1 or 2 more h of sleep/day might just be ""The thing"" I need to gain more energy in the day. I'm mature enough to acknoledge the complexity of sleep and I know ADHD is really  a bitch.

Anyway, if anyone can relate to my trouble and have even a hutch about wdf might be happening 
during m'y night time, I'd really appreciate the feedback !


Attached is a representative example of my ""night"" according to sleep cycle App ( for what it's worth).

I have Delonghi Dedica EC685 for 5 years now. I've bought manual hand coffee grinder with precision grinding adjustment, bottomless portafilter with non-pressurized busket, i removed panarello from a steamer so it could make more silky milk foam. This little machine makes best coffee i've ever tryed.

I want to progress in this direction so i considering purchasing LeLit Anita (PID) as a birthday pressent to myself. I watched a lot of reviews on YouTube and read a lot of comments in this subreddit. As I understand it, these bunget semi-professional coffee machines are preaty rough and doesn't have much quality of like features as cheaper home coffee machines.

For example i can make as much coffee and steam as much milk as i want(because Delonghi Dedica EC685 doesn't have boiler system), meanwhile budget espresso coffee machines have little boilers that must be heated for a long period of time before brewing espresso. Lelit Anita have a small boiler, so it can potentially struggle with making more than 1 cup of cappuccino (for example if i would like to make 2-3 cappuccino cups for me and my family members) and doesn't have any automation as my Delonghi that can make brewing process easier (it has pre-wetting and it has a flow-meter so i can programm brewing time by the amount of water is needed to make a coffee)

So here is a question: does it worth it to invest big amount of money in LeLit Anita? Will I be able to taste the difference between 51mm and 57,35mm portafilter?

(Part 4 of 4)","[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1kfuidm/i_think_my_little_sister_is_being_blackmailed_why/)

In the weeks which followed after my return from the hospital my Toby-possessed family did their best, for a short while, to pick up the slack around the house. 

They cooked, they cleaned, and they continued to play their parts outside the house to perfection. 

Their improved behaviour lasted for about a month before they started going back to their old habits of sticking to their rooms and eating junk food. 

I couldn't pick up the slack like I had done before. Not just because of my broken arm, but because I was in no fit state to look after myself, let alone them. 

I had developed chronic insomnia. 

After trying so hard to keep things together myself I, like the rest of my possessed family, just kind of gave up trying. The difference between me and them however was that I stopped leaving the house altogether, whilst they continued their perfect charade as usual. 

They had considered threatening me to make me act right, but quickly found that I just didn't have it in me to be afraid of them like before. 

Nine months passed. My insomnia didn't get any better. Most days I spent with Toby. Although I hadn't been there when the conversation happened, I was sure Toby-Leigh, Toby-Mum, and Toby-Dad had pressured him into keeping constant watch over me. 

In a somewhat ironic twist I had become, in their minds at least, a suicide risk. 

They were giving me too much credit. I had stopped feeling any emotion except for a constant apathetic numbness which, at times, threatened to give way to gut-wrenching dread. 

I lost a lot of weight, dropping from sixty kilograms down to a mere fifty-five kg. Eating any food at all seemed like a gigantic chore. Swallowing even a mouthful of water was like trying not to choke on a throatful of thick maple syrup. 

The only thing which brought me any semblance of joy at all was drawing. For about an hour a day I was able to muster the concentration and effort to draw whatever came to mind. Over the nine months I filled multiple sketch books and notepads with doodles of manga drawings; nothing particularly coherent, just sketches of characters and some landscapes. 

Toby bought me more pens and pencils and paper when I needed it. Most of the time however he just sat in the room with me and watched whatever it was I was doing, whether that was me staring at the TV at whatever show or movie he put on, or him playing a video game; most of the time when I watched I was so lost in my own thoughts all I saw was the lights changing in front of me and the changes in sound. My sleep deprived mind didn't have the bandwidth to concentrate on any of it for more than a few minutes here or there. 

The dirty dishes in the kitchen mounted until a thick, nasty odor stank throughout the entire house. Cups of tea and coffee and cans of soft drinks were left all over the house. 

Over the nine months my possessed family, as well as Toby and myself, watched on as the grime and filth took over close to every inch of the house. 

The curtains were drawn to keep the neighbors from looking in at the mess. The windows were closed, which trapped the horrid stench and the countless flies buzzing around. 

The upstairs toilet was clogged sometime in the fourth month, and no effort was made to fix it. After several more uses of the toilet were made by the others, the bathroom door was simply shut, leaving the contents of the toilet to marinate. 

The sheer horrendous living conditions my Toby-possessed family had descended to was something which I hoped might make them decide to give up control of my family's bodies. 

The incident with whatever the thing was – I had decided at some point that it was a demon, and thought of it as such – had confirmed at least one thing for me. It was possible to give up control of a body. The demon had wanted me to astral project out of my own body, so it was reasonable to assume that Toby, the ones controlling my sister, mother, and father, might also be able to willingly give up their bodies too. 

The question was whether or not there even was my family's minds, their souls, somewhere still in their bodies. Or had Toby, in the act of possessing them, somehow over-written, removed, or erased their souls from their bodies for good?

My biggest consolation was that the Toby's possessing my family weren't able to go from body to body, the way someone might change their t-shirt. They had told me before that they were trapped in their bodies, and only had the power to imprint a new copy of their minds onto other people. For that reason I wasn't afraid they might possess anyone else as a means to avoid living in such a disgusting environment at home. 

The only effort any of them made at home was when they prepared to leave the house to continue their charade. I wondered why they still maintained the charade, and guessed it was their way of taking a break from the reality of being their true Toby-selves at home; getting the same satisfaction of pretending to be my family member's as if they were in a pleasant dream; on some level keeping up the charade must have been exhausting for them.  

One night Toby came upstairs and sat in my bedroom with me. I was sitting on the floor drawing the mote of a heavily fortified castle. 

""Here you go,"" Toby said, setting down a takeaway cheeseburger and a small bag of salted fries. 

I looked at the food having no appetite for it at all.Toby started eating his own burger. 

""I was thinking we could go out for a walk tonight,"" said Toby jovially after he swallowed a mouthful of burger, ""What do you think?"" 

I just stared at him. 

Toby patted the carpet. 

""Darn,"" he said, ""Where's the-"" 

""-you forgot these,"" said Toby-Dad from my bedroom door. 

He stepped over a box containing the moldy remains of a takeaway curry in order to hand over two cans of cola. 

Toby took them and Toby-Dad lingered for a moment. He just stood and watched me drawing the same way Toby liked to watch me. I just kept drawing and at some point over the next ten minutes Toby-Dad left the room without me noticing. 

Toby slurped from his can of cola after chowing down his burger. 

""So,"" he said, ""You want to go for that walk?"" 

Again, I just stared at Toby. A part of me was in disbelief with how he was behaving. At some point he seemed to have stopped trying to act guilty about the whole situation. If anything, he seemed pleased how things had turned out. He had only resisted spending every waking hour in my company out of a sense of guilt, but nine months in, he stopped pretending.

He was finally happy. 

""Oh Mike,"" he said, ""Eat something."" 

I hadn't eaten in at least twenty-four hours and, if anything, I still felt too full to eat. My lips however were parched so I took my can of cola and took a tentative sip. Swallowing the fizzing sweet liquid was tough. It took me about thirty minutes to manage a handful of gulps. 

I woke up sometime later. 

I quickly found there was something tight against my mouth. It took concentrated effort from me not to gag on the wad of whatever dry fabric was there.

My eyes struggled to open. Slowly, I took in the confines of my Dad's car. I was in the middle backseat. The car was still in the garage. 

Toby was next to me to my left. His eyes were wide and frantic and he, like me, had his mouth gagged and his hands and feet bound with lengths of rope.

Toby-Leigh was sitting unbound, ungagged, to my right. Her face was tinged with gold from the car's dome light.

Toby-Mum was sitting in the passenger seat, also not bound or gagged, and was looking at the three of us in the backseat as if proud of us. 

The car engine was running. Toby-Dad closed the door which led into the house and got into the driver's seat of the car. 

""Okay!"" he said, with a strange jovialness, ""Everybody ready?"" 

Toby squirmed with every ounce of his strength beside me. I just stared back at my Toby-possessed family whilst also trying to continue breathing through my nostrils. 

Toby-Dad turned the keys in the ignition, revving up the car. The emission from the car, trapped in the garage with nowhere to go, started to thicken in the air. 

""Toby you can keep fighting if you want but nothing is going to change,"" said Toby-Dad. 

It was as if Toby couldn't hear them at all, he continued to try and break free of the rope binding his hands and feet with every fiber of his being. I could see however how utterly useless these attempts of his were. 

My mind felt drowsy, no doubt from whatever they had slipped into my cola before. 

""Wait,"" said Toby-Leigh, as if remembering something very important. 

Toby-Mum veered round again and I saw Toby-Dad looking at us from the front mirror. 

""You're not having second thoughts?"" said Toby-Dad. 

""No,"" said Toby-Leigh, ""I just think we should let Mike say goodbye to his family. Don't you think that would be the kind thing to do?"" 

Toby-Mum and Toby-Dad considered this. By this point the stink coming from the house was becoming strongly mingled with the fumes quickly filling the garage. 

Toby-Dad killed the engine. 

""You're right,"" he said, ""It's the least we can do."" 

As if breaking character Toby-Leigh, Toby-Mum, and Toby-Dad all changed suddenly. Their gazes looked about the confines of the car until they found me. 

""Mike!"" said Toby-Leigh, but she sounded so much like the real Leigh. 

I felt her arms wrap around me as she held me close. She started to sob. Her whole body was trembling. 

""I'm so sorry,"" she said over and over again, ""There's nothing we could do."" 

I looked at Leigh and saw my sister looking back at me, her face shiny-slick from building sweat and the fresh tears streaming down her face. My heart ached, having almost forgotten what it was like to be close to my real sister. 

I felt Mum's hand at my knee. Mum was crying too. 

""You've been so brave,"" she said, ""We've been here the whole time. We'll be with you again when this is over. Okay?"" 

I found myself nodding profusely, tears running down my cheeks too. 

""I'm proud of you, son,"" said Dad in a shaky voice. His hand rested on my other knee. He sniffled, fighting the onset of tears. 

""It'll be like going to sleep,"" said Leigh into my ear encouragingly, ""Then we'll be together again."" 

I nodded, not caring it was all a lie. 

And then all at once the performance stopped and Toby-Leigh, Toby-Mum, and Toby-Dad snapped back into the driver's seat of their bodies. They sniffled and wiped away the tears that were on their faces, tears which none felt belonged to them. 

Toby-Dad started the car engine again. And again thick car exhaust began to fill the garage. 

Toby-Leigh, Toby-Mum, and Toby-Dad sat back in their seats, ready and prepared to die. 

Toby had worn himself out trying to get free of the ropes binding him. Instead he looked at me with wide unblinking eyes. 

The fumes in the car steadily built and, bit by bit, what oxygen was left in the garage was steadily used up by the car's running engine. 

Relief took hold of me. One way or another at least this was all going to be finally over.

\*

I woke up in my bedroom. 

Toby-Leigh's face swam hazily into view as my eyes struggled to focus on her face. 

She was crying. 

""Mike?"" she said, ""Are you okay?"" 

""Yes,"" I said, my voice weak and hoarse. 

Toby-Leigh looked incredibly relieved. She didn't bother to wipe the tears from her eyes. 

""Mike,"" she said, smiling, ""It's me, it's Leigh."" 

My stomach tied up in knots. 

No, I thought, It can't be true. It's too good to be true. I don't believe it. 

""Mike,"" she said again, ""We're back. We're all back. Are you…still you?"" she said. 

Toby-Leigh, or maybe, somehow, just the real Leigh, looked me over with a hint of suspicion. 

""I'm…still me,"" I said, weakly. 

My sister dove onto me, wrapping me up in her arms and sobbing. 

Maybe I died, I thought, Maybe this is some kind of heaven and the nightmare is over? 

""Mum! Dad!"" Leigh cried out, and quickly Mum and Dad came thundering up the stairs. 

""Mike! Mike!"" they both exclaimed, sobbing and taking hold of me. 

It had quickly become one big family hug. 

But I couldn't let myself feel the relief of having my family back. I still had too my questions. 

""Where's Toby?"" I said. 

It took a few moments for my family to ease off me. Their moods darkened. 

""He's gone,"" said Mum. 

""Where?"" I said. 

""We don't know,"" said Mum, ""We came back to ourselves. Regained control of our bodies. We've been able to see and hear everything that has happened this whole time. We're back."" 

I noticed then what looked like deep scratch marks at Mum's neck. 

""We took the ropes off him,"" said Dad, ""But he tried to hurt us. He'd lost his mind. We couldn't calm him down."" 

So where is he? I thought. 

""He ran off,"" said Dad, ""And if you ask me; good riddance."" 

I sat up a little, my whole body ached. Every breath of mine was a hard wheeze. 

""But he might come back,"" I said, ""He might try and take you all over again."" 

""I don't think so,"" said Dad. 

Mum and Leigh nodded, agreeing with Dad. 

""His face looked…wrong,"" said Dad, ""I don't think it was Toby who was in control of his body when he left."" 

The demon, I thought. 

""So he's out there, somewhere?"" I said. 

Dad nodded. 

""What if he comes back?"" I said. 

""Then we'll have to handle it if he does,"" said Dad, ""But we can't call the police right now. Not with the house in the state it's in, not with you like you are. We need to put things right first."" 

Dad ran his hand through my hair. 

""It's going to be alright, son,"" he said, ""You rest up. We're going to get everything back to the way it was. Promise."" 

Mum kissed me on my cheek. ""We're so proud of you,"" she said. 

Her words echoed what I had heard before in the car, when Toby had given me back my family for a few moments. 

As much as I wanted to believe my family was back, I simply couldn't allow myself to accept they were for a long time. 

In the days that followed Mum, Dad, and Leigh made it their mission to clean up the house. This was no easy task, but they set to it diligently. 

They didn't go off to hang out with friends or go to work like the Tobies had done when keeping up their charade. Instead they made excuses for their absences and devoted all their time to undoing the damage the Tobies had done. 

My insomnia and difficulty eating didn't go away overnight. 

A month later I still found it difficult to sleep, but managed to get several hours in a night rather than none at all. 

Mum took it upon herself to make sure I ate properly, feeding me a range of supplements on top of her usual home cooked meals. 

We kept a wary watch out for Toby's return, but he had seemed to vanish after he had been set free. The thought of a demon-possessed Toby prowling the world kept me up at night, and had me always on guard no matter what I was doing at home. His family had asked us if we knew about his disappearance, even suspected we had something to do with it. It helped that none of my family knew where he was, making it that much easier to plead our innocence when a police investigation was underway. 

Although the whereabouts of Toby remained a mystery, everything else returned to normal. It was surprisingly easy for my family to slip back into their old routines, because Toby, to his credit, had done well to maintain their social lives out of the house. 

Leigh and Mum had complained a good deal about all the weight they had put on, but it wasn't anything a steady diet couldn't fix. 

The whole ordeal however had left me damaged. I couldn't help but remain suspicious of my family even six months after they had returned to their bodies. 

The house was back to normal, their behavior was consistently normal too, but still the lingering question of what if Toby was still inside them somewhere plagued my mind. 

I asked them a thousand questions to get to the bottom of what happened the night the Tobies had planned their group suicide in the car. 

Had my theory been right? Had they somehow given up possession of my family's bodies somewhere within the midst of dying? 

The demon, I thought, again, the one that had wanted my body. Had it played a part, somehow, in ridding us of Toby? Had the demon, in the act of claiming its most coveted prize - a human vessel - inadvertently done some good? 

There was no clear answer. 

When I was finally able to get a good night's sleep on a regular basis I would have the same nightmare of a horrible, rotting face. In my nightmare I would think of this face as the demon. 

During the nightmare the demon would chase Toby, me, and the rest of my family through a funhouse mirror maze. Each time I lost sight of my family, instead seeing reflections of myself everywhere I went. Sometimes the dream ended with the rotting face of the demon finding Toby, smothering him like a mask as he thrashed and screamed. Other times I found myself lost in the maze, with only my reflections for company, desperately seeking a way out but never finding it - not until I finally woke up. 

But maybe that's all it was? Just a nightmare? That was all that was left of Toby's influence in my life? 

I often found myself gazing into the bathroom mirror wondering if, maybe, I was no longer me. What if the demon had taken me over somehow? Would I know it? My family, according to what they told me, were painfully aware of everything Toby had done when he was in control of them. 

I still felt in control of myself. 

After a while I had to admit to myself that everything was okay. Things really had returned to normal. The nightmare was over. 

I would still need to keep a vigilant watch for Toby Pickford, wherever he might be (Dad had bought a state of the art security system for the house as an extra precaution.) 

I don't know if this will be my final entry. I hope the nightmare is well and truly over. 

I was going to wrap things up here but there was something I thought worth mentioning. Something I wish I hadn't seen.

In my paranoia I decided to look for any potential clues that Toby might still be hidden somewhere inside each member of my family. 

What if he had decided to commit a different kind of suicide? What if he decided to diminish himself in their bodies, going so deep inside my family as if to pretend to be no longer there? Would I be able to tell if my family was truly back? I doubted Toby was still in control because the house was no longer a disgusting mess, and in every aspect my family had returned to normal. 

One afternoon, when Leigh, Mum, and Dad were out of the house, I decided to go snooping around their rooms. 

I checked Leigh's room first. 

To my relief, and after a very invasive search, I didn't find anything amiss. 

That is, until I checked under Leigh's mattress. 

What I found was something that should have been innocuous. 

It was a notebook and several pens. Within the notebook was a wealth of amazing doodles. All of them in a manga style. My style to be exact. 

It doesn't mean anything, I thought to myself, don't jump to conclusions. 

I took a photo of the drawings with my phone and put everything back as I found it. Then I searched Mum and Dad's room. After a long search I found what I really hoped I wasn't able to find. 

Two notebooks, filled with manga drawings, hidden away in the back of their closet. All in the same style as my skill level of drawing. All the same style as the drawings in Leigh's notebook. 

I took more pictures, saving them to my phone, giving myself time to go over and compare them. 

I don't want to jump to conclusions, but I really, really hope my suspicion is wrong. 

I don't know if this will be my last entry.

1kgwadu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teeth/comments/1kgwadu/better_understanding_reason_for_the_best_time_to/,Better understanding reason for the best time to brush?,"So I've always had the incorrect idea that it was best time to brush after having a sugary snack of caffeine drink was as soon as possible. The idea I had was that there would be remnants of sugar still in your mouth doing damage, and that if I brushed straight away that the coffee (or whatever) would only have a few minutes to do any damage.

So I've learned that you need to let the pH come back up to what it should be before brushing. I think it's because teeth are porous and you'd actually be brushing the caffeine into the teeth if you brushed straight afterwards. So I'm thinking fair enough I get that. But then I realised that if you drink tea or coffee that there's no way of avoiding the damage it will do in the 30 minute you wait for the pH to come back up. Once you consume sugar/caffeine you are committed to the damage it will do over the next 30 minutes, or else you'll just make it worse if you brush straight away afterwards. Am I correct in saying that? And if you've waited that long then what's the point in brushing again if the pH is where it should be.

Also, does rinsing your mouth out with water after such a snack do anything to speed up the amount of time it takes the pH to come back up.",1,1746621448.0,Teeth,1,1.0,False

This all started because we have a trip coming up to Sandals In Jamaica.  The wife has been working out trying to lose weight and look good for months.  
Of course I slacked off and waited until last minute I was fluctuating between 212-215 lbs.  One Monday morning decided that's it and just stopped eating sugar and soda.  Created my own diet drinking black coffee and water.  Low carbs.  Smaller meals only 3 meals a day ,so you're regular breakfast lunch and dinner. 
17 days in I'm down to 197 lbs. 
I have my own treadmill and universal gym set-up.  Wasn't hard for me to stop the sugar, there was a day or two where I was craving a pizza or a burger but I got through it.  
The real treat is waking up everyday and looking in the mirror to see my belly shrink.  However I think it's taking a toll on me now.  I'm not sure how you guys keep the motivation to work out. I must be doing something wrong because lifting weights is a little rough for me I'm not one to exercise I'm pretty active during the day at work.  But now I've been on the treadmill every morning for 30 minutes and I try to workout before dinner.  BUT, weights are heavy lol and I don't really enjoy it.  I try to listen to metal music during the workout to try and keep me motivated. 
But I tire quickly and I feel like I'm getting nowhere.  
Wondering if I should use lighter weights and longer reps 12-14
For a few months and get myself into shape first before going shorter reps and higher weight.  It just doesn't feel tight though.   I mean I'm already more than half the weight on the fly machine.

1kgw7ix,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kgw7ix/could_the_nespresso_vertuo_singleserve_coffee/,Could the Nespresso Vertuo single-serve coffee maker review change your mornings?,"The Nespresso BNV250CRO1BUC1 Vertuo Coffee and Espresso Machine, Chrome landed on my kitchen counter a few weeks ago, and since then, I've been knee-deep in coffee pods, because honestly, testing it has morphed into a caffeinated adventure. This shiny chrome marvel promises single-serve brewing with the push of a button, offering a range of beverage sizes while throwing in the aesthetically pleasing Aeroccino milk frother. Let’s just say—my mornings, afternoons, and random coffee-craving moments haven't remained the same.

**Innovative Design and Build Quality**  
Straight out of the box, this espresso machine presented itself as sleek and compact, with dimensions that perfectly suited my limited countertop real estate. The chrome finish doesn’t just make it look like a luxury gadget; it feels sturdy and well-crafted. The machine is intuitive, with buttons and a water reservoir that didn’t require an engineering degree to figure out. One underrated feature is its surprisingly lightweight design, clocking in at 10.8 pounds—no heavy lifting when you decide to give it a cleaning spree. Plus, the reusable filter adds a nice eco-friendly touch for those of us trying to reduce waste, though I noticed it demands a bit of extra maintenance.  

**Brewing Capabilities and Customization**  
Everything about the brewing process screams simplicity and efficiency. With five cup-size options—ranging from a petite 1.35 oz espresso to a satisfying 7.7 oz mug—they’ve covered nearly every craving. I even tested an ""iced coffee experiment"" by brewing directly over ice, and honestly, it worked like a charm. The patented Centrifusion technology, which reads the barcode on capsules to figure out optimal brewing parameters, felt futuristic and kind of gimmicky at first. But I have to admit it nailed the flavor every single time, delivering consistently rich, flavorful cups of coffee or espresso.  

**[Check Nespresso BNV250CRO1BUC1 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b01mzcqby4/)**  

**The Aeroccino Milk Frother: An Unexpected Delight**  
I didn’t expect much from the Aeroccino3 milk frother included with the set, but boy, was I wrong. Creating velvety foam for cappuccinos and lattes in just seconds? Yes, please. It became my go-to tool for adding that “coffeehouse luxury” to weekday mornings. It’s quiet, no unnecessary buzzing or rattling, and can froth both hot and cold milk, appealing to my seasonal preferences.  

**Performance and Speed**  
Each brew session begins within 15 to 20 seconds of turning on the machine, which might sound standard, but it’s a game-changer on groggy mornings. The automatic shut-off function kicks in after nine minutes of inactivity, making it energy-saving, though occasionally inconvenient for someone like me who forgets to rinse and reload second cups quickly. The used capsule ejection function that holds up to 17 capsules is a practical feature—cleaning up takes no effort.  

**Positives**  
- Brewing simplicity with one-touch operation.  
- Versatile options for cup sizes and iced beverages.  
- Elegant Aeroccino milk frother adds a touch of luxury.
- Automatic capsule ejection and energy-saving features.  

**Limitations**  
- The machine relies entirely on proprietary pods, which might frustrate those who prefer third-party options or wish to grind their own beans.  
- While the reusable filter is helpful, cleaning it can be a hassle.  
- Compact water tank size (40 oz) requires frequent refilling if you’re a heavy coffee drinker like me.  

**Exploring Product Contenders**  
Compared to competitors like the Keurig K-Café and De’Longhi Dedica, the Nespresso Vertuo stands out for its sleek design and flavor consistency. The Keurig is undeniably versatile for multi-drink households, accommodating both pods and ground coffee, but it compromises on espresso strength and taste. De’Longhi’s Dedica leans into the authentic espresso experience with manual customization, a more suitable choice for coffee enthusiasts who favor full control. While the Nespresso Vertuo sacrifices flexibility by being pod-dependent, it excels where flavor and simplicity meet.  

**Worth Every Penny**  
Discussing value without pinpointing the exact price, I’ll say this: the convenience and flavor quality packed into this chrome machine? Totally satisfying. Compared to other premium coffee-makers, it hits a sweet spot for anyone who wants fuss-free brewing with a café-quality experience. Plus, the included starter set of pods provides a nice introduction to their broad flavor profiles.

## Key Features Analysis

the following features are most frequently enough considered when choosing a white long sleeve shirt: fabric material, thread count and stitching, proper fit, opacity, and care instructions.

**Fabric Material:**

The material of a white long sleeve shirt considerably impacts its comfort, breathability, and longevity.Options range from 100% cotton to blends involving polyester, rayon, or even linen. A higher quality cotton, such as Pima or supima, generally offers a softer feel and greater durability than standard cotton. Synthetic blends, on the other hand, may provide enhanced wrinkle resistance or moisture-wicking properties, making them suitable for specific activities or climates. It is vital to consider how the shirt will be used, and what priorities the user has in terms of softness, breathability, wrinkle resistance and durability.

**Thread Count and Stitching:**

Thread count, while more commonly associated with bedding, also plays a role in the quality of a woven shirt. A higher thread count generally indicates a denser weave, which can result in a smoother, more durable fabric. However, the type of yarn used is equally important; high-quality yarns will produce a better fabric even with a moderate thread count. Stitching quality is another crucial factor to consider. Reinforced seams, neat stitching, and durable thread all contribute to a shirt's ability to withstand repeated wear and washing.Examining the stitching around the collar,cuffs,and hem is a good way to assess the overall construction quality.

**Proper Fit:**

A well-fitting white long sleeve shirt is essential for both comfort and aesthetics. Fit preferences vary from slim and tailored to relaxed and oversized. Key areas to consider include the shoulder seams (which should lie flat on the shoulder),the chest (which should allow for comfortable movement without being too tight or too baggy),the sleeve length (which should reach the wrist bone),and the overall length of the shirt (which should be long enough to tuck in comfortably but not so long as to bunch up when untucked). Many brands offer different fits, such as slim fit, classic fit, or athletic fit, to accommodate various body types and style preferences.

**Opacity:**

The opacity of a white long sleeve shirt is a critical consideration, as no one wants a shirt that is see-through. Thicker fabrics and denser weaves generally offer greater opacity. Some brands use special treatments or dyes to further enhance the opacity of their white shirts. Testing the shirt in radiant light is a good way to assess its opacity before purchasing. hold the shirt up to a light source to see how visible any underlayers are, or have another person wear it and check whether the skin is visible.

**care Instructions:**

The care instructions for a white long sleeve shirt can impact its longevity and how easy it is to maintain. Shirts that require dry cleaning may be impractical for everyday wear, while those that are machine washable and dryer-kind offer greater convenience. Pay attention to specific instructions regarding washing temperature, bleach use, and ironing. Some fabrics may require special care to prevent shrinking, fading, or damage.

## FAQs Section

Before investing in a long-sleeve white shirt, here are some frequently asked questions.**How do I prevent my white long sleeve shirt from yellowing?**

Yellowing of white shirts is often caused by a buildup of detergent, body oils, and sweat. To prevent this, use a high-quality laundry detergent and avoid overloading the washing machine. Consider adding a cup of white vinegar to the wash cycle to help remove buildup. Avoid using chlorine bleach regularly, as it can weaken the fibers and contribute to yellowing over time. Instead, opt for oxygen-based bleach or a whitening booster. Make sure to properly dry the shirt directly after washing, or line dry outside, as heat can cause oil residue to set.

**What is the best way to remove stains from a white long sleeve shirt?**

Act quickly when dealing with stains on a white shirt. The sooner you treat the stain, the easier it will be to remove. For common stains like coffee, wine, or food, try blotting the area with a clean cloth and applying a stain remover specifically designed for white fabrics. For tougher stains like ink or grease, you may need to use a specialized stain treatment or take the shirt to a professional cleaner. Avoid rubbing the stain,as this can spread it further.Rinse with cold water and repeat until gone. Never put the shirt in the dryer before ensuring the stain is wholly removed, as heat can set the stain.

**What type of undershirt should I wear under a white long sleeve shirt?**

The ideal undershirt for a white long sleeve shirt is one that is lightweight, breathable, and close to your skin tone. A light gray or beige undershirt is less likely to be visible than a white undershirt,which can sometimes create a shadow effect. Look for undershirts made from moisture-wicking materials like microfiber or a blend of cotton and synthetic fibers to help keep you cool and comfortable. Consider a v-neck undershirt to avoid it being seen if you will be leaving the top button of the white shirt unbuttoned.

I’m currently a Y1 student doing their second semester here in NTU! I do a lot of workouts so I’m always on the hunt for good filling (ideally high protein) meals!

I’ve compiled a list of my favourite foods I’ve tried during my first year. Please try some of the stalls I’ve recommended, because I think some of them might be closing down soon!

Recommended foods
1. $2 Soft serve froyo (only available on Monday, Wednesday and Friday): one of the best froyos I’ve had in my life and better than smooy I’d say. They also do $2 soft serve ice creams too! 📍 the coffee bar opposite nanyang auditorium 

2. $4 Ban Mian: cheap and flavourful noodles. Nice aunties working there as well! Super underrated store📍North Hill food court’s Ban mian store 

3. Fruit juices under $4 and under: very sweet auntie and the juices are always on point! Check out her store because I think she’s closing forever from June onwards.📍Canteen 11 Fruit juice store 

4. Dry Japanese ramen: idk if it’s just me but it’s a really good substitute if you like din tai fung noodles. 📍Canteen 11 Japanese store 

1. Chicken chop, fries and rice. Weird combination I know, but the gravy they give is so savoury and their meat is perfectly cooked. Only place in NTU ik that does their chicken and fries right.📍 Canteen 14, Western food store 

8. Matcha: artisan quality and better than the diluted matchas outside ! Has oat milk substitution for lactose intolerant people too.📍 venture drive coffee at north spine (Ik there’s one at Gaia, but idk if their quality differs) 

9. Tom yum pasta, fish and chips and chai latte: these are the foods that they do right by.📍CO-OP cafe 

10. Chicken and rice: for my protein baddies who are tired of Singaporean chicken rice, I really like the carrot salad they give. Have not tried their banh mi and pho yet, but it looks good. 📍Vietnamese store at the quad cafe 

11. South indian veg set: very carby and large portions! Quite decent Indian food as well! 📍Taj at North Hill 


12. Beef gyudon: I can’t eat other gyudon from anywhere else after eating here. But one of the more expensive options in NTU fyi! 📍Connect71 

13. Chicken biryani and mango lassi: one of the best Indian foods I had on campus! 📍Bismillah biryani 

14. Carbonara: I always order this from Cates and they never miss. Cheap and large portions too. 📍Canteen 4 Pasta stall



❌Overrated/avoid list

1. Quad cafe Korean food: after hearing the hype about it and trying 2 times (their Korean chicken and samyang tang), I feel like it’s any other food court Korean stall food?? Obnoxiously long queues as well. Not worth queueing! 

2. CO-OP cafe chicken chops: always either undercooked or overcooked. Extremely small portions and expensive as well! 

3. Canteen 16 western food: chicken chop. Avoid avoid!! Worst food in my life. I ordered in from cates and the portions they gave me were so fucking laughable. The chicken was sour and half cooked and the fries were hard. The worst part is that it was cold and gave me a stomachache after😭 

4. Pasta express: tell me why tf does a carbonara/cream based pasta have garlic in it…anyway if you want to not smell like garlic, do not walk into this place!! I can literally smell the garlic fumes from a mile away.

5. Indian store at Tamarind canteen: cold and hard rice and butter chicken :(( ",56,1746620634.0,NTU,10,1.0,False

1kgvwfu,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreeceTravel/comments/1kgvwfu/i_hiked_the_menalon_trail_in_4_days_here_are_my/,"I hiked the Menalon Trail in 4 days, here are my tips","I have just completed the Menalon Trail and thought I'd share about my trip and give advice for other travelers! I hiked from Stemnitsa to Lagkadia in 4 days, stopping overnight in Dimitsana, Vytina, and Valtesiniko. I'll share some questions I had before starting and answer them so others can know what to expect.

**How much English is spoken in the villages?**

Definitely enough to get by without Google translate! People will greet you in Greek, but quickly switch to English when you reply.

**Do I really need hiking boots/poles?**

I brought boots and left my poles at home, and I think this was the right decision for me. I would definitely recommend hiking boots, as the trails can be rocky and steep. Some folks were I runners, but I appreciated my boots. Poles would not be overkill, but I don't generally use them, so I did not miss having them.

*Other notes about gear*

I don't want to list my entire packing list, but I will highlight a few key items. My backpack was the Osprey Quasar 26, which is a pretty average backpack with a chest strap and hip strap, but not a lot of support. It worked fine, but I would rather have had one with a proper hip belt. I did not bring a water bladder, which was fine, and I did not have the extra space in my pack, but I would have liked having the extra water. However, I did bring a life straw, which I used often to have a refreshing, cold drink from the streams that sometimes run along the trail. I wore long pants for hiking, which kept the grass and bushes from scratching my legs. I did see people in shorts, but I was glad I chose pants.

**Am I too ambitious trying to do it in only 4 days?**

Ambitious, yes, but not overly so. If you are fit and short on time, 4 days is enough to hike the trail. However, I do wish I'd done 5, if only for the social aspect. I met other hikers on my first day, but because I was hiking farther the second day, I was not able to hike with them the rest of the trail. I don't mind hiking alone, but I would have liked to be able to stay with them a bit longer.

**What will cell service be like on the trail?**

If it is relevant, I had a Cosmote prepaid Sim. On the trail, connection was spotty, but in the villages I had a consistent strong connection and could send photos, take video calls, etc, over data.

**Will I be able to pay by card most places?**

Yes, most places accepted card, like restaurants and hotels. Some small mini markets or grocery stores preferred cash, but I was never making large purchases there, so it was fine.

**What will amenities be like on the trail?**

There are occassionally monasteries, which will have bathrooms and water and may offer you coffee. There are also fountains occassionally, which I filled my water bottles from directly.

Overall, I had an amazing experience! I met other hikers, who were very friendly, ate the best food I've had so far in Greece, and saw beautiful landscapes. Feel free to ask any questions, and I will do my best to answer them!",2,1746620277.0,GreeceTravel,1,1.0,False

I've been drinking a lot of tea lately, too. I'm trying to see what is the best stuff to out in tea for taste and for health. Just started growing some herbs to put in the tea.
