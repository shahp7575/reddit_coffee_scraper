For many students, music is more than just entertainment—it’s a powerful tool for concentration and motivation. However, while music can enhance the study experience, it can also become a distraction if not used correctly. Knowing how to use music effectively while studying can help boost focus, improve mood, and make learning more enjoyable. Here are some tips on how to stay focused while studying with music.

**1. Choose the Right Type of Music**

Not all music is suitable for studying. Lyrics, fast beats, or loud instrumentals can interrupt your train of thought, especially when you're trying to read, write, or solve complex problems. Instead, opt for instrumental music, classical pieces, lo-fi beats, or ambient soundtracks. These types of music create a calm background that supports focus without drawing too much attention.

**2. Keep the Volume Low**

Music should stay in the background. If the volume is too high, it competes with your thoughts and reduces your ability to retain information. Keeping the volume low helps your brain stay alert without being overstimulated. Think of it like background noise in a coffee shop—just enough to fill the silence, but not enough to take over.

**3. Use Music to Create a Study Routine**

Listening to the same playlist each time you study can act as a cue for your brain to enter ""study mode."" Over time, your brain will associate those specific sounds with concentration and productivity. This helps you get into the right mindset more quickly and consistently.

**4. Take Breaks Without Music**

While music can enhance focus during study time, it's important to have breaks in silence. Use your break times to step away from your desk and give your brain some rest without stimulation. This contrast between sound and silence can help refresh your mind and improve your overall concentration when you return to your work.

**5. Match the Music to the Task**

Different tasks may require different kinds of music. For example, if you're doing something repetitive or creative, upbeat or rhythmic music might help. But for reading or writing, something softer and slower might be more appropriate. Experiment with different styles and observe how your focus changes.

**6. Limit Multitasking**

Avoid using music as a way to multitask—for example, don’t scroll through your phone or check social media while listening. The goal is to enhance your study session, not to add distractions. Music should support your learning environment, not compete with it.

**Conclusion**

Studying with music can be a great way to stay focused, reduce stress, and make learning more enjoyable—but only when done intentionally. By choosing the right music, keeping it at a low volume, and aligning it with your study goals, you can turn music into a valuable part of your academic success. So next time you sit down to study, press play on a calming playlist and let the music help you find your flow.",1,1745204593.0,u_Mysterious-Nail2265,0,1.0,False

Yet somehow they have been monitoring my iphone and macbook activity for months—regardless of if I'm at home or at a coffee shop. I had been connected to their wifi because I didn't think people outside of movies actually did sh!t like this, and I definitely didn't think the people who needed me to set up their Alexa could do this. 

More context: I went on a couple dates with a guy in August, connected to his wifi (in the moment my gut did feel uneasy given how this guy was acting and how long it took him to ""make sure the password was right,"" but I was delusional about how he felt about me). This guy and my parents did meet before he and I went on a few dates. There was contact between them from July through November. 

In March, once I finally got distance from this guy. Things started to click. Especially after reading through old journal entries. I journal using the Remarkable, which has an iphone app, so he had access to all of it. Once I started processing that, I started to notice my parents slipping up. They referenced things there was no way of knowing—things that were only on my phone or computer on multiple occasions (and still haven't stopped). There is also evidence they were watching me through my petcam while they were away. It also has an iPhone app. (Ironically, I had once told that guy I dated that one of my biggest fears was that I was on the Truman Show.)

Here's my problem. I have done multiple factory resets on both devices. I have stopped connecting to their wifi (I haven't been able to move out yet). I have done everything short of getting a classic Nokia and typewriter. How is this happening and what can I do? I feel like I'll never have (digital) privacy again.

1k43j0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1k43j0v/reviewing_some_of_the_veganvegetarian_food_we_ate/,"Reviewing some of the vegan/vegetarian food we ate in Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto in mid-April 2025 (with some general tips and advice as well)","This subreddit was a helpful resource for me when I was planning our trip this year in April, and since I see questions about food being asked here, I thought I’d do a general round-up of eating vegan and vegan in Japan during a 10-day trip (Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto):

The two of us (me- mid-20s and my mom- early 50s) are both vegetarians (not vegan) and eat eggs sometimes (mostly in desserts). This is my overall review of some of the places we ate at in Japan and some general observations/tips for people in a similar boat. 



Now onto the reviews:

**TOKYO**

**Vegan Bistro Jangara:**

Location is super convenient because its close to everything in Harajuku. The ramen restaurant below (Kyushu Jangara) also has vegetarian options but we opted to go to the bistro because there was no line when we went. However, it filled up quickly and there was a wait time of 15 minutes during peak lunch time. They do take your order while you’re waiting.  
Food was great. We got ramen within a set with a side of gyoza and a pomegranate/goji berry soda. Portions were great and broth was delicious, perfectly salted and great flavour. Only wish there had been more pieces of the soy meat.

Price: ¥2650 (1 main (set) + 1 non alcoholic drink)

Rating: 5/5

**IamDonut Harajuku:**

We were tempted to stop here after our lunch at Bistro Jangara, and the line outside this apparently viral donut shop did not deter us. While we were waiting in line, a staff member handed us a copy of the order form to fill out, with the full list of available donuts in both English and Japanese, and the queue moved fast— we were in it for about 7-10 minutes. Is it in a touristy hotspot? Yes, but the line was mostly comprised of Japanese locals. 
We enjoyed both donuts though the matcha donut could have used a filling to balance out the texture. If you’re a fan of desserts that lean sweeter, I would skip these donuts, or opt for the strawberry and chocolate flavoured ones. 

Price: ¥600 (2 donuts but each flavour is differently priced)

Rating: 4/5

**Mr Farmer:**

Pricier than some of the other places on this list, Mr Farmer was definitely “Westernised” vegan food, with a fairly small menu of salad bowls, rice bowls, and vegan burgers. We got a rice bowl and a burger and were satisfied with both, especially since our criterion for picking this place was that we were craving a vegetable-forward meal. There could have been more flavour in both dishes but neither was bad either, just could have been improved. The quality was good and portion sizes were too.

If you’re not used to or do not like the taste of mock meats, I would skip this place or opt for only salads as they do use it in their other mains. 

Price: ¥4686 (2 mains + 1 non alcoholic drink)

Rating: 4/5

**Andhra Dining Ginza:**

Yes, we ate Indian food in Japan. We’d originally planned to go to Ain Soph Ginza but they were fully booked for the entire evening and we did not have a reservation (so I would recommend making one during high season). We were incredibly hungry after having shopped and walked around in Ginza, and went to Andhra Dining, which also has a branch in Shibuya. We each got a dosa (lentil crepes) and a mango lassi to share, and the food was excellent. Indian food in general is probably the most vegan and vegetarian friendly by default, so we knew we weren't taking a risk. 

Price: ¥3330 (2 dishes + 1 non alcoholic drink)

**Falafel Brothers:**

This was honestly a fantastic, budget friendly option smack in the center of Shibuya. It's quite small but the concept is falafel bowls, with the option of customising them as per your preferences. We were starving after Shibuya Sky and just wanted something hearty and filling, and this fit perfectly. Very good portion sizes. The staff were also super sweet, and accommodated our request for some extra pita bread instead of the side salad. A great place imo, and they have branches in other places around Tokyo like Roppongi as well. 

Price: ¥2600 (two dishes + 1 cookie)

Rating: 4.5/5

**Coco Ichibanya**

Probably the best value for money meal of the entire trip, and I’m not sure if all the branches have the vegetarian curry option but the one we went to in Hatchobori near our hotel in Nihonbashi did. There is a good amount of flavour in the curry and the portion of rice can be tailored to your level. Being able to customise your order and even the quantity of rice was perfect for us, and the curry was delicious. The staff were very friendly and spoke and understood English, and menus are available in English as well as Japanese.

Price: ¥1100 (curry with large portion of rice + 2 non alcoholic drinks)

Rating: 5/5

**Komeda is HIGASHI GINZA**

This is a fully plant-based place in Ginza, and it was the one we waited at the longest during our mid-April trip to get seated (20 minutes). They have a small, compact menu mostly of sandwiches, burgers, and pancakes. We got a soy based katsu sandwich and a curry mayo burger, both of which were delicious (albeit the sandwich could have used more sauce and the soy ham cutlet was too thich). The true highlight, however, was their unassuming coffee jelly with whipped cream, which was insanely good and a great way to end our meal. The portions are also big - the burger was massive. They also open for breakfast, and have some set options you may want to consider if you’re in the area. The reviews were especially raving about their bread. 

Price: ¥2800 (sandwich + burger + dessert)

Rating: 5/5

Rating: 5/5

**Injoy:**

Injoy is actually a vegetarian tea ceremony restaurant with limited lunch and dinner menus. We were excited for it because the reviews were great, and it is very close to Sensoji Temple and Nakamisedori Street, so we went after visiting the two attractions. We were not too hungry so we got a bibimbap set (to share) and an additional iced tea (one drink was included in the lunch set already).

The portion of the bibimbap was good but the biggest let down was the service— it was incredibly slow, and it felt even more so because other tables around us were getting served even after having ordered after us. The taste could also have been improved, it was well-seasoned but lacked the signature punch of Korean flavours. The servers were very sweet and kind though, and they were very apologetic for the delays. 

If you’re in Asakusa, it might be worth a shot but it is much pricier than a lot of other vegan places in Tokyo imo and we did not think the lunch set was worth the 3200¥ price tag. 

Price: ¥4000 (1 lunch set - includes a small soup and a tea + 1 iced tea)

Rating: 3.5/5


**OSAKA**:

**Saijiki:**

This small Taiwanese vegetarian restaurant is close to Shinsekai and really delicious. We had their wonton soup, their braised soy meat rice bowl, and their baozi, and everything was flavourful and filling. Super value for money and one of our favourite meals from Japan.

Price: ¥1200 (3 small dishes)

Rating: 5/5

**Vegan Ramen by Playpen Friends (Nara):**

I had bookmarked a few options for Nara but this one is the closest to Todaiji temple and was open for lunch. We got seated quickly and it was already quite full. We got the vegan tonkotsu ramen to share and a glass of sake. The ramen was delicious but I have no reference point for what true tonkotsu tastes like so I cant judge it fairly, and the portion was big (we were full after sharing it). Its a little more expensive than most places in Osaka or Kyoto (with one ramen costing ¥2000) but it was also not too insane that I would dock points for value. It was not the best ramen of our trip but it was a solid meal.
 
Price: ¥3000 (1 vegan ramen dish + 1 alcoholic drink)

Rating: 4/5

**Shama Indian Vegetarian:**

We needed a quick lunch after doing some last-minute shopping at Shinsaibashi-Suji before leaving for Kyoto and this hit the mark. Yes, it is pricier than other Indian restaurants in general around Japan but I understand that the location is a factor in it being so. We got a rice set (white rice with two house curries, a sweet, and a drink) and a papad chat to share. Everything was delicious and well-balanced—not too heavy, but still really satisfying. I especially enjoyed the mixed vegetable curry, which had a great depth of flavour. If you’re vegetarian or vegan and looking for a hearty, good meal, I’d recommend it. 

Price: ¥2500 (1 set + 1 appetizer)

Rating: 4/5

**Pivot Base@Dotonbori:**

This was a restaurant I had been excited for because they advertised vegan takoyaki, and the location was excellent in the heart of Dotonbori. We waited about 20 minutes to get seated only to be told they had run out of takoyaki by 7pm on a weekday. We decided to stay and order the curry and rice, and the vegan kushikatsu. The curry and rice was decent but the kushikatsu was not good and only tasted of oil. 

I’m not usually that fussy, but if a dish is being marketed as the standout item or specialty, I do think it’s important to make sure it’s consistently available, especially during main meal hours. Overall, it wasn’t a bad experience, and the service was good so perhaps they had an off day, but not one I’d go out of my way to revisit.

**KYOTO:**

**Kamehameha:**

The only restaurant in the entire trip I had reserved 10 days in advance before we left for Japan and boy, was it worth it! It's a tiny, 14-seater very close to Nishiki market nestled in a quiet bylane away from the crowds.

This is one of the only places that serves vegan and vegetarian Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki. You can reserve your date and time online through their website. We got one vegetarian okonomiyaki to share and a garlic rice (Note: they have a one dish and one drink/per person policy, so please respect that). I got a guava sour and my mother got a ginger ale for drinks. 
This was a highlight of our trip 100%. The okonomiyaki was superb—crispy, flavourful, and really satisfying, and the garlic rice was simple but so indulgent. The chef and staff were super friendly, and it was a great experience watching everything cooked right in front of us.

Price: ¥3600 (1 okonomiyaki dish + 1 teppanyaki dish + 1 alcoholic beverage + 1 non-alcoholic drink)

Rating: 5000/5

**Yak and Yeti:**

Another tiny, quaint place close to Nishiki Market. Very reasonable prices for a really decent sized dinner meal, with tasty and simple Nepali food (we got a rice set and plate of momos - both very good). The staff is super welcoming and warm, and they understood food restrictions very well. Note: They also serve non-vegan food. 

They’re also open later than a lot of places in Kyoto (till 10pm) and there was no wait when we went, and service was quick and efficient. Would definitely recommend it! 

Price: ¥3015 (2 dishes + 1 non-alcoholic drink)

Rating: 4.5/5

**Matcha House Kyoto:**

With the full self-awareness that this is a tourist trap, we went to get the matcha latte with ice cream and red bean and damn, it was good!


**Bassa Nova Ramen:**

While their vegan ramen are in no way authetnic (in terms of the flavour profile they’re trying to recreate), this was still a very solid, quaint place in the heart of Kyoto. If you love Thai flavours, especially green curry, you're going to absolutely adore their vegan “ramen” options (which were honestly more curry noodles than anything else). It's not a complaint though, because the food was tasty and portions generous. Docking one point because the vegetable gyoza was mediocre, and so was the iced tea. While this wont win any awards for being extraordinary in any way, it's still a good option in an area that tends to be limiting. 

Price: ¥2500 (1 ramen + 1 side dish + 1 non alcoholic beverage)

Rating: 4/5







Overall Tips: 

1. Pre Trip: Research: If you’re like us and do not eat any meat whatsoever, research is important. Japan is not a country where you can wing it. 

2. Drop pins on Google Maps: I scoured multiple blogs, YouTube videos, Instagram reels, and Reddit posts, to drop pins on all the places that looked exciting or came recommended. @itadakihealthy’s Google Maps list was **insanely helpful**.  Load it onto your own Google Maps and it overlays your own saved pins with hers. Linked here: https://maps.app.goo.gl/co4UKhP4sDNav2xZA?g_st=i.

I also found Veg_Maps' list helpful: https://maps.app.goo.gl/qW2a1Nj4YfdDGnjH9

3. Dont feel bad or shame yourself for your food choices. Japan is an incredible country with a long culinary history but there are other ways of enjoying yourself and experiencing the culture. For example, we didnt eat sushi but I dont think that in any way discounts our incredible trip. If you want to eat at chains/fast food restaurants/other cuisines (like we did), do it— nourishment is important. I live in Paris but I always tell folks who are visiting me that the city does great food other than just French.  Japan was no exception-- we didnt have single bad meal. Our goal was to make sure we didnt starve but also didnt inconvenience anybody, or expect them to cater to us.

4. If you’re worried about allergies or potentially eating meat or fish products, stick to vegan-only restaurants and bakeries. We’re not so particular so we were ok with eating at non-vegan places too.

5. Nut milks/non-dairy milks (apart from soy milk) are rare unless you’re in a vegan cafe. I did notice some Tully’s Coffee shops (which are everywhere) had both soy and almond milk options.

6. Because we both had the same culinary preferences, it was an enjoyable experience overall to find and eat around restaurants in Japan. We’re also not very particular about the occasional accidental injestion of meat products, which is why we didnt pay too much close attention to some desserts etc. However, if you’re in a mixed group, this will be a challenge because it will be very unlikely to find a meal every person enjoys. I can imagine meat eaters will want to enjoy the full works of this incredible cuisine. But I'd be happy to be corrected if someone else had a different experience!

7. For better or for worse, the vegan and vegetarian friendly places tend to be concentrated in places with high tourist traffic, such as around Nishiki Market and Teramachi in Kyoto, or Shibuya in Tokyo. I would keep this in mind when planning meals, because it is not as easy to find an alternative if the place you want to eat at is full and you’re somewhere that has no other options.

8. Get the pickled plum onigiri from 7/11 or Lawson. If you’re like me, you’ll eat like 20 of those in your entire trip.",1,1745204434.0,JapanTravelTips,0,1.0,False

## What is Immediate Prism App?

Immediate Prism App is an **automated trading platform** designed to help users take advantage of market movements without constantly staring at charts. The software uses algorithms to analyze real-time market data and automatically places trades based on predefined strategies.

Think of it as your personal trading assistant—minus the coffee breaks. It’s tailored for both new traders (who might feel overwhelmed by the complexity of markets) and more seasoned folks who appreciate **automation and speed**. The platform supports multiple asset classes, including **cryptocurrencies**, **forex**, **stocks**, and **commodities**, which is a big plus if you like to diversify.

## Who Created Immediate Prism App?

There’s not a ton of public info about the individual or team behind Immediate Prism App, which is common with many of these algo-trading platforms. Some speculation suggests it could be developed by a group of experienced traders and software engineers, possibly the same crew behind similar platforms like **Bitcoin Code** or **Immediate Edge**.

While the lack of transparency might raise eyebrows, it’s worth noting that this isn’t necessarily a red flag—many algorithmic trading tools operate anonymously or under company umbrellas. What matters more is the platform’s **performance, security, and user experience**, all of which I’ll cover in this review.

## How Does Immediate Prism App Work?

The Immediate Prism App works by using an **automated trading algorithm** that scans the markets for profitable trades. Once it identifies an opportunity, it can **execute trades on your behalf**—meaning you don’t need to manually buy or sell assets yourself.

Here’s a simplified breakdown of how it works:

- You sign up and make a deposit.
- The system runs a real-time market analysis using technical indicators and historical data.
- When a trade setup matches the algorithm’s criteria, it places a trade.
- You can monitor and adjust settings like risk level, assets traded, and trade size.

It’s like putting your trading strategy on autopilot—but with knobs to tweak. You still have control, but the app does the heavy lifting.

## Immediate Prism App Pros and Cons

Let’s be real—no platform is perfect. Here’s a quick rundown of what I liked and what could be better.

**Pros:**

- ✅ **Easy to use** – Great for beginners and those not too tech-savvy.
- ✅ **Automated trading** – Saves time and reduces emotional trading.
- ✅ **Multi-asset support** – Trade crypto, forex, stocks, and more.
- ✅ **Demo mode** – Try it risk-free before putting real money in.
- ✅ **Fast withdrawals** – Most processed within 24–48 hours.

**Cons:**

- ❌ **No mobile app** – It’s browser-based, which is fine, but a native app would be nice.
- ❌ **Limited info about creators** – Could use more transparency.
- ❌ **Risk of loss** – Like all trading platforms, profits aren't guaranteed.

One of the cool things about Immediate Prism App is its **cross-device compatibility**. You don’t need a high-powered PC or a fancy setup. If you’ve got internet and a browser, you’re good to go.

Supported devices include:

- **Desktop computers** (Windows & macOS)
- **Laptops**
- **Tablets**
- **Smartphones** (iOS & Android via browser)

The UI adjusts well to screen size, so you can easily monitor trades on the go—even without a dedicated mobile app. Just bookmark the site and you’re set.

## Immediate Prism App – Supported Countries

- **United States**
- **United Kingdom**
- **Canada**
- **Australia**
- **Germany**
- **France**
- **South Africa**
- **India**
- **Parts of Asia and Latin America**

## Immediate Prism App – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

The heart of the platform is its **real-time market scanner**. It constantly pulls data from multiple sources to spot trading opportunities. The algorithm uses technical analysis indicators like RSI, MACD, and moving averages.

What impressed me is how **fast and accurate** it seems to be. It’s not perfect (no bot is), but it does a solid job of staying ahead of major price moves—especially in crypto.

### User-Friendly Interface

The dashboard is clean, intuitive, and doesn’t bombard you with jargon. Whether you're new to trading or just want a smooth experience, **the UI is very beginner-friendly**. You can easily navigate between settings, portfolios, and trade history.

Even if you’ve never traded before, the layout makes it simple to get started.

### Mobile Accessibility

While there’s **no dedicated app**, the web version works well on mobile browsers. I tested it on both iPhone and Android, and it was responsive and fast. That said, I do wish they’d launch a native app for push notifications and smoother navigation.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up **custom alerts** for price movements, news events, or trade confirmations. This is super helpful if you want to stay informed without being glued to your screen all day.

You can choose to receive alerts via email or in-browser—no SMS yet, unfortunately.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Immediate Prism App supports a **wide variety of assets**, including:

- Cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, LTC, etc.)
- Forex pairs (EUR/USD, GBP/USD, etc.)
- Stocks (Apple, Tesla, etc.)
- Commodities (Gold, Oil, etc.)

If you like to mix things up or hedge your bets, this kind of multi-asset support is a big bonus.

## Is Immediate Prism App a Scam?

Honestly, I don’t think it’s a scam. There are always sketchy platforms out there, but Immediate Prism App seems to operate more transparently than many. It has:

- **SSL encryption**
- **Secure user verification**
- **Regulated broker connections**
- **Consistent customer support availability**

That said, always approach automatic trading platforms with **caution and realistic expectations**. Use the demo mode first, and never invest more than you’re willing to lose.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Immediate Prism App?

The **minimum deposit** is **$250**, which is pretty standard across most automated trading platforms. You can fund it using:

- Credit/debit cards
- Bank transfers
- Some e-wallets depending on region

# Coffee Grading Systems

When exploring which is the[ best coffee in the world](https://gomehedi.com/best-coffee-in-the-world/), understanding coffee grading systems is crucial. These systems help differentiate high-quality beans from the rest. Coffee grading involves evaluating beans based on factors like size, shape, color, and defects. This ensures consumers get the best possible coffee experience.

# Specialty Coffee

Specialty coffee stands out due to its exceptional quality and unique flavors. This type of coffee undergoes rigorous grading by certified Q Graders. These experts evaluate beans based on several criteria:

* **Flavor:** The coffee’s taste profile, including notes like fruity, nutty, or chocolatey.
* **Acidity:** The brightness or tanginess of the coffee.
* **Body:** The weight or thickness of the coffee on the palate.
* **Aroma:** The scent of the coffee, which can range from floral to spicy.
* **Balance:** The harmony between the flavor, acidity, and body.

Specialty coffee must score at least 80 out of 100 on the Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) cupping scale. The grading process also involves examining the beans for defects. Beans with no primary defects and minimal secondary defects qualify as specialty coffee.

Here’s a simple table summarizing the key points:

|Criteria|Description|
|:-|:-|
|Flavor|Unique taste notes|
|Acidity|Brightness or tanginess|
|Body|Weight on the palate|
|Aroma|Scent of the coffee|
|Balance|Harmony of flavors|
|Defects|Minimal to none|

Specialty coffee is often single-origin, meaning it comes from one specific region or farm. This allows for unique characteristics and traceability. Coffee enthusiasts appreciate the attention to detail and quality in specialty coffee.

# Commercial Coffee

Commercial coffee, often found in supermarkets, differs significantly from specialty coffee. This type of coffee is typically a blend of beans from various regions. The focus here is on consistency and affordability rather than unique flavors.

The grading system for commercial coffee is less stringent. Beans are often evaluated based on size and the presence of defects. Here’s a simple breakdown:

* **Size:** Beans are sorted by size, with larger beans generally considered better.
* **Defects:** Beans are checked for defects, but the standards are more lenient.

Commercial coffee beans are usually roasted to a darker profile. This masks inconsistencies in the beans and provides a uniform taste. The focus is on producing a consistent product that appeals to a broad audience.

Here’s a table to highlight the differences:

|Criteria|Description|
|:-|:-|
|Size|Sorted by size|
|Defects|Checked but lenient standards|
|Flavor|Consistent and uniform|
|Roast|Darker roast|

Commercial coffee caters to those who prefer a reliable and affordable cup of coffee. While it may lack the unique characteristics of specialty coffee, it remains a popular choice for daily consumption.

# Aroma Characteristics

The aroma of coffee is an essential part of the tasting experience. It’s the first thing you notice when you brew a fresh cup. Here are some key aroma characteristics of world-class coffees:

* **Spicy:** Spicy aromas might include notes of cinnamon, clove, or even pepper, adding a warm, complex scent.

The aroma gives you a hint of what to expect in terms of flavor. It’s influenced by the coffee’s origin, processing, and roast level. Lightly roasted coffees might have more vibrant, delicate aromas, while darker roasts can have deeper, more intense scents.

Thought maybe Caitlyn’d appreciate a little “thank you” after I used the Z-Drive to reverse that tiny lil’ incident where I blew her mom to smithereens back in season two. You’d think resurrecting someone’s dead mom earns you some points, right?

Wrong.

Caitlyn looked me dead in the eyes and said, “You tampered with time to fix a problem you created.”

I said, “Exactly! Growth!”

Ungrateful.

Tried making her breakfast this morning. Burnt toast, acid coffee, and a note that said “Family means never having to say sorry for war crimes.” She didn’t laugh.

Vi laughed. Caitlyn hit her with the newspaper.

Anyway, I carved “#1 Sister-In-Law” into Caitlyn’s rifle case. And then put glitter on it. She said I defiled a precision weapon. I said she defiled my heart by never hugging me.

I also tried bonding with Vi again today. Like, actual sister bonding. I didn’t even bring explosives. That’s personal growth, right?

I found her in the kitchen, slamming the fridge shut because Caitlyn used the last of the milk. So I slid her a smoothie I definitely didn’t steal from a freshman. Said, “Peace offering?”

She stared at it like it owed her money.

Then I pulled out the old photo—us, Powder and Vi, little kids before the world went kaboom. Told her I missed this. Told her I missed her.

She sighed. Said, “You always do this. Blow up the house, then hand me flowers made of shrapnel.”

I told her, “Yeah, but the flowers are homemade.”

She didn’t laugh. Not even a smirk. Just got up, patted my head like a dog, and muttered, “You’re lucky I still love you, psycho.”

I’ll take it.

Baby steps. Or big sister punches.

Either way—I’m still trying.

1k43c4v,https://i.redd.it/ebttsqhxq3we1.jpeg,Just found out why I get headache taking adderall,"I started taking meds last week and ever since i usually get headaches. A lot of people are saying it’s “normal/common side effect” and just make sure you are hydrated and eating enough. 

I almost made a post earlier asking if anyone experienced headache ONLY when going out because apparently i dont get them when i’m at home. I took one earlier, was just playing games and as soon as I go out and started driving i get tension headache. I would say the pain is 6.5/10 and just take ibuprofen whenever i get it. 

So I just got home and thought of using the BP monitor. I used it before and i don’t think it’s reading properly because i know my normal BP is around 120/80 and this monitor is showing its around ~103/60 and i got checked somewhere few weeks ago and it’s 120/80 thats why i knew its inaccurate. 

To my surprise my BP in this monitor while taking adderall is 141/84. I instantly felt scared not knowing what could’ve happened if i kept taking it and didn’t know i’m having blood pressure. And since this monitor is inaccurate before, I’m thinking what if my BP is actually around ~200/100 and I’m casually working and driving.

# Original Ingredients (and my modifications)

1/2 cup lupin flour 

1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 

1/2 cup keto sweetener (I used 1/4 cup of erythritol mixed with monk fruit and 1/4 tsp stevia powder)

1 tablespoon instant coffee (I omitted)

1/2 teaspoon baking powder 

1/2 teaspoon sea salt 

8 tablespoons butter 

2 tablespoons coconut oil (I used more butter)

3 eggs 

1 teaspoon vanilla extract 

Optional:

1/4 cup sugar-free chocolate chips or chunks of dark chocolate (I used a mix of bittersweet chocolate chips and cacao nibs or just cacao nibs)

1/4 chopped nuts (I used slivered almonds or chopped walnuts)

(I also added 1 tsp to 1 TB shredded coconut)

# Instructions:

Preheat oven to 350 degrees  (I used a toaster oven)

Line an 8x8 baking pan with parchment or grease with butter and set aside 

In a medium-sized bowl, mix all your dry ingredients together with a whisk, making sure to break up any clumps 

Melt your butter in the microwave and stir in the vanilla 

Using a spatula, stir the butter and vanilla to the dry mix. Cool it down before adding the eggs 

Add in the eggs and mix very lightly, only to bring all the ingredients together 

Pour into prepared pan and bake for 20 minutes. (I used a toaster oven and baked for 17 min, turning once halfway and then let it rest in the oven for 3-4 min. Then inserted a chopstick in the middle and it came out clean.)

Remove from pan and allow to cool before serving.

I made this recipe two times recently because I wanted to use up some lupin flour that I bought and my partner and I really liked it the first time. It was my first time baking with lupin flour and we weren't able to tell that it wasn't wheat flour! In the second version, I used cacao nibs instead of chocolate chips so it didn't taste as sweet, more like a dark chocolate brownie. Still very tasty!

## What is Bitcoin Pro 360 Ai?

Bitcoin Pro 360 Ai is an **automated trading platform** that uses artificial intelligence to analyze market data and execute crypto trades. It promises to simplify the often chaotic world of cryptocurrency by using smart algorithms that make trading decisions faster than a human could.

Instead of manually analyzing charts or reacting emotionally to market swings, this platform claims to do it all in real time. It’s like giving a supercomputer your trading strategy and letting it trade for you while you focus on other things—like coffee or sleep.

## Who Created Bitcoin Pro 360 Ai?

This is where things get a little murky. Like many of these AI trading tools, **Bitcoin Pro 360 Ai doesn’t have a clearly named founder or development team**. That’s pretty standard for platforms in this space, but it can make some people hesitant.

However, it seems to be backed by a group of developers and AI engineers with experience in fintech and algorithmic trading. Some of the tech behind it overlaps with what we’ve seen in platforms like Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge. So while the exact creators remain anonymous, the tech stack appears legit.

## How Does Bitcoin Pro 360 Ai Work?

Here’s the simplified version: you deposit funds, set some basic trading preferences (or let the AI choose for you), and the algorithm scans the crypto market 24/7. Once it spots a profitable opportunity, it places a trade automatically.

It uses AI models trained on historical data and real-time market signals, looking for patterns that suggest asset prices will rise or fall. It reportedly executes trades in milliseconds, which gives it a speed edge over manual trading. You can also choose between **manual mode**, where you approve trades, or **auto mode**, where the AI runs the show.

## Bitcoin Pro 360 Ai Pros and Cons

Let’s keep it real. No platform is perfect—here’s what stands out.

**Pros:**
- ✅ AI-driven trading with fast execution
- ✅ Supports multiple asset types, not just crypto
- ✅ Offers a demo account for practice
- ✅ Beginner-friendly interface
- ✅ No hidden fees beyond the initial deposit

**Cons:**
- ❌ Unknown creators may concern some users
- ❌ Market volatility can still lead to losses
- ❌ Not available in all countries

If you decide it’s not for you, deleting your account is simple:

1. Contact customer support via chat or email.
2. Request account deletion and withdrawal of funds.
3. Most users report the process takes **1-3 business days**.

What are your pro tips & hacks?

\--

**1. Eat more protein, fewer processed foods**

* Make every meal revolve around  protein (eggs, chicken, fish, Greek yogurt, beans)
* Fill the rest of your plate with veggies or whole grains
* Avoid processed foods... aka foods changed from their original state —  adding sugar, fat, salt, or preservatives and other crap
* Eat slowly. Put your fork down between bites, count to 10, do something!
* Chug a glass of water before every meal

**Rule:** If it’s in a package with more than 5 ingredients, skip it.

**2. Move every day (it doesn’t need to be a workout)**

* Walk 7,000+ steps a day — break it down w/ smaller walks
* Take stairs, park farther, walk after meals -- find a reason to walk
* Do short bodyweight workouts 2–3x/week:
   * Squats, pushups (incline or on knees), planks, lunges
   * 15 minutes is plenty

**Rule:** Do something physical daily. 5 minutes is better than 0.

**3. Sleep 7+ hours. Manage stress.**

* Poor sleep increases hunger + cravings
* Stress = emotional eating. Use yoga, walks, or journaling or just count to 10!
* Create a 20-minute wind-down routine (no screens)

**Rule:** If you fix your sleep, your diet gets easier.

**4. Repeat daily. Don’t aim for perfect.**

* Show up even if it’s not your best day
* Build streaks, not streak breaks
* If you miss one day, don’t miss two

**Rule:** 80% consistency beats 100% intensity for 3 days

**5. Use cues & reminders to make it stick**

* Set the same time to walk, eat, sleep
* Stack new habits onto current ones (""after coffee, stretch 1 min"")
* Use a daily check-in to keep momentum



**Summary:** Eat protein. Walk daily. Sleep enough. Repeat. That’s how you lose weight and keep it off. No frills, no magic bullets, no gimmicks. It’s not easy - but these are the  habits & tactics that work.

1k432kc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Constipation/comments/1k432kc/share_plums/,Share Plums,"I've been thinking about making this post for awhile in hopes it will help someone.  I am in no way affiliated with this or any other brands. I just came on and searched for share plums in this thread to see if anyone else has posted about them, and I did see a couple things but decided to still make my own post.

I was completely dependent on full large bag homemade water enemas for over 3.5 years. I have now not had to use an enema since before Christmas. I tried True Lance, Motegrity, Linzess, magnesium citrate, magnesium oxide, stool softeners, senna, suppositories (two different formulas), Saline enemas, trifala, bisacodal, miralax,  a couple others things i can't remember the names of, and 9 months of pelvic floor PT.  I also went off my antidepressant for 2.5 years and got back on it in July 2023, but neither helped my constipation. 

Before becoming enema dependent, I was constipated for many years but was able to manage with the Magnesium Citrate and stool softeners and occasional suppository type laxatives or Saline enemas. Literally everything that had worked before stopped working rather abruptly in the beginning of 2021, and only full bag water enemas did the trick.  Actually i was also using coffee enemas for a few months too, in 2021.  All of the prescription meds mentioned above, and Miralax, trifala, bisacodal and others-  were tried after becoming enema dependent.  Bisacodal did make me go- but it only worked well for me if I limited the use to very occasional.  Everything else made my poop likewater but it wouldn't come out...or I should say, only about a tablespoon of it would come out maybe 2-3x a day.

In May 2024 I went on the carnivore diet. After 3 months I started having small poops that were diarrhea but it was more movement and amount than I had had since before the enemas. Still, it just wasn't enough volume coming out and I had to do enemas but less often than before (before this development I was doing one every other day).  In December 2024 I tried share plums after my friend had heard about them and passed the info on to me.  They literally instantly worked for me. On the carnivore diet they would make me poop within 2 hours and I only needed a fourth of a plum and my poop was still coming out as diarrhea. But I was having huge amounts of poop and I was just so dang happy. 

I quit the carnivore diet on January 1st 2025 for reasons not related to pooping. I now need 3/4 of a plum because my motility is so much slower not on a carnivore diet. I take the plum at 4:00 p.m. and I usually poop between 2 and  5 a.m. (work/sleep schedule is lame).  However, it's not always exact as far as when I end up pooping and sometimes I have multiple small ones throughout the day rather than a couple big ones in the morning.  I have pelvic floor dysfunction, rectocele, cystocele, and abdomino phrenic dyssynertia so this all affects my going #2 as well.

I know share plums are expensive but as someone who thought seriously that i might have a colostomy bag one day, they have been nothing short of miraculous. If you buy 3 bags on the shareswiss.us site you get $50-ish off which is what I did at my last purchase once I knew for sure these were working for me on a regular basis.  First I got the 7 count sampler, next time one bag, next time 3 bags.

They also have a drink which I only tried a few sips of when they had sent me free samples, but my 18 year old son who does not have constipation problems drank a whole one, and let's just say he didn't leave the toilet for a while 😂.

Also I have really bad bloating issues, and these did make that worse for a couple weeks but my tummy adjusted, thankfully!  Sorry for long post.  I don't often post on reddit but when I do I always over share 🤷‍♀️. ",2,1745202938.0,Constipation,1,1.0,False

## What is Immediate Eurax Ai?

**Immediate Eurax Ai** is an AI-driven trading platform designed to help users make faster and more informed trading decisions. It leverages automation and real-time data to identify market trends and execute trades on your behalf—or give you alerts so you can decide when to jump in.

Think of it as a **smart assistant for trading**. You don’t need to sit in front of charts all day, and you don't have to be a Wall Street pro to use it. It’s geared toward people who want to get into trading but might not have the time or expertise to dive deep into technical analysis.

The platform supports multiple markets—**cryptocurrency, forex, stocks, and even commodities**—so you’re not limited to one niche. That’s pretty cool, especially if you're looking to diversify.

## Who Created Immediate Eurax Ai?

The creators of Immediate Eurax Ai have kept things relatively under wraps, which is pretty common in this space. There’s no single public figure like Elon Musk or Brian Armstrong behind it, but based on the structure and similarities to platforms like **Bitcoin Era** or **Immediate Edge**, it likely comes from a team of fintech developers and traders with experience in AI and financial markets.

What’s clear is that the platform partners with **regulated third-party brokers**, which adds a layer of legitimacy. Even though we don’t have personal bios on the devs, the tech and backend suggest it wasn’t slapped together overnight.

- Or **send you an alert**, so you can decide whether to act

It’s like having a trading assistant who never sleeps and can monitor global markets 24/7.

The platform is web-based—so no downloads needed—and works on both desktop and mobile browsers. You don’t need to install anything or worry about compatibility issues. Just log in and go.

- Most of **Europe**
- **Australia**
- **South Africa**
- Parts of **Asia**
- **Canada**

However, it’s **not available in the U.S.**, which is a bummer for American traders. This is usually due to strict financial regulations rather than any shady practices.

## Immediate Eurax Ai – Top Features

This is Immediate Eurax Ai’s bread and butter. The platform’s AI scans markets in real time, tracking trends, news, and price movements. It’s like having a team of analysts working 24/7, minus the lunch breaks.

There are some scammy platforms out there, but Immediate Eurax Ai doesn’t raise the usual red flags. It works with **regulated brokers**, offers **demo accounts**, and doesn’t hit you with unexpected fees.

Of course, **no trading platform can guarantee profits**. The AI helps, but markets are unpredictable. Still, based on my experience and the transparency of the system, I wouldn’t label this one as a scam.

To activate your trading account, you’ll need to deposit **$250 USD**. This is pretty standard across AI trading platforms like Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge.

Customer support is available **24/7**, and you can reach them via:

- **Live chat**

I tested the chat myself, and responses came within a few minutes—pretty solid. They were friendly and didn’t just copy/paste answers. No phone support, though, which might be a letdown for some.

1k431zc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1k431zc/it_weird_to_have_a_crush_on_someone_i_met_on_a/,it weird to have a crush on someone I met on a Twisted Wonderland Discord server?,"Hey everyone, I’m 19 and I’ve been kinda overthinking this, so I figured I’d ask here to see if anyone else has gone through something similar.

So I’ve been part of this Twisted Wonderland server on Discord for a few months now. It started out as just a fun place to talk about the game, share fanart, do dumb memes and whatnot. But there’s this one person I met there who I’ve grown really attached to. At first, we were just replying to each other’s messages in the main chats, but then we started talking more in DMs, and now we talk pretty much every day.

They’re super funny, smart, and honestly just really kind in a way that feels rare? Like, they actually listen when I vent, hype me up when I talk about stuff I’m working on, and they remember little details I’ve mentioned before—even random stuff like my favorite dorm or how I take my coffee. We’ve voice chatted a few times too, and they have this voice that just… makes me feel calm and safe, if that makes sense?

The thing is, I’ve never had a crush on someone I haven’t met IRL before. I’m used to liking people I see regularly in real life, but this feels different. Like yeah, we met through a fandom server, but the connection feels genuine. And I’m just stuck wondering—is it weird to have feelings for someone I’ve only known online? Is it even real if it’s all through screens and messages?

Part of me wants to tell them how I feel, but I’m scared it’ll make things weird or ruin the friendship we have. Especially since we’re in the same server and interact publicly sometimes too. I’m also not even sure if they feel the same, or if I’m just romanticizing everything because they’re the first person in a while who’s made me feel seen and appreciated.

Has anyone else caught feelings for someone they met online like this? Is it something I should just ignore or see where it goes? I’d love to hear how others have handled this, or if I’m just being way too in my head about it.

Thanks in advance if you read all this, I really appreciate it.

I got on hinge after 3 months, feeling I was ready to explore.

Anywho, now that I’m back in the dating game I’m trying to be open minded. I’ve went on 3 dates off hinge so far. 

Probably spoke to each guy for about a week prior to the date. First one it seemed he liked me but I was not interested at all. Nice guy, but a lotta red flags. 2nd guy, we went to a coffee shop. It was like we were both on a date with him. He was so egotistical & spoke sooo loudly, it was almost embarrassing. I did have an ok time though, it wasn’t horrible. I wasn’t interested in him because he spoke too cocky. Though with trying to be more open minded I was down to give him another shot if he really wanted. Texted me that he didn’t feel a spark, so there’s that lol! Weird how it still hurts your feelings a tad even when you weren’t into them much. 

3rd date, best personality so far but I didn’t feel any physical attraction whatsoever. We went & got drinks & had good conversation for a few hours. I had a decent time but felt 0 physical attraction. Not sure if it was mutual, he told me I was a cutie after the date but we were both pretty dry with eachother so I just removed him. 

I have 2 more dates planned this week. So in my life, not counting my ex, I’ve been on like 6 dates. Never had a 2nd date with anyone. Is that normal? It feels like there’s something wrong with me.

Please forgive my formatting as this is being written on my cell and I'm a bit nervous as I am a reddit posting virgin🤣
I am now 50 (f) and and on divorce #2 because, frankly, I am a people pleaser and choose broken men. But no more! 

For some much needed context, my first husband ended up being diagnosed with covert narciscisstic personality disorder (with a strong hatred of woman) 2 months before blessedly walking out after 13 years.. I could never figure out what was wrong with my family and felt the odd person out (along with my Dad). An amazing therapist post divorce helped me realize that my family is full of narciscisstic and toxic people. I have been no contact now for over a decade solid. Now onto the story:

This story pertains to my first wedding. We had a vision of a very small, immediate family only wedding because we wanted to have it in a quaint little mountain town just west of Calgary, AB (😉😉 You'll know, Charlotte). It's expensive to get married there but that was our wish. We also opted not to have bridesmaids and groomsmen as to not have drama and hurt feelings. We did everything in our power to make sure it was a relaxed and enjoyable experience. Neither of us cared about details like centre pieces and such and so left that to our mothers. We found out very quickly that they were two peas in a pod and had a passive aggressive hatred for one another.

My dress was a whole other issue and I didn't not get what I wanted. I got my mother's vision.

We planned to be married on the riverbank. My mother just could not get her head wrapped around that. In the end, we had a good old May snowstorm and had to be married at the quaint little inn we were staying at. We were happy with that. Others were not.

I had a close friend whom I had been a bridesmaid for that really didn't understand why she couldn't be there. I caught wind from some work colleagues that she and another friend intended to crash the wedding. I found this out at our dinner on the wedding eve and had to have a convo with her that that was not to happen in no uncertain terms. She was hurt and just couldn't understand. 

Our officiant liked to have coffee with the couple the morning of the ceremony to focus them and I loved that piece. However, we weren't gone an hour before our phones were ringing because the mothers and my aunt were arguing over how to decorate tables🤦‍♀️ and where the hell were we!? I should mention it was 10am and the wedding was at 4pm.
The issue, you ask??? If the ""congratulations "" confetti on the tables was placed upwards the right way..wtf?? I said I was busy and didn't care to which I was told ""I should"" by my mother.

Somehow the ceremony happened without a hitch (despite my mother's little unplanned speech that drew the attention to her as the MOB). My mother was mad because pictures took longer than expected (snowstorm), but we finally got to to dinner (which was fabulous!) and dancing. In my head, the minor squabbles and inconveniences were behind us. I could NOT have been more wrong!

I won't bore you with more anecdotes because this is getting long:, I'll just lay out what happened next:
1) My ex FIL (who actually is a lovely man) got more drunk than I'd even seen him before or since and ended up being babysat in the bathroom all night by my youngest trouble-making brother (so 2 birds and all that). 
2) My ex husband's oldest brother drunkenly confided in him that while his wife had been 6 months pregnant with their oldest (now 5/6), he had cheated on her with an old highschool GF but no one else knew. He just felt the need to unburden himself to someone (his words) that night and chose my then-husband.
3) My mother attempted to control every aspect of the evening while the MIL shot daggers.

We left early and hoped that by our brunch/gift opening in the morning, that people would have reeled themselves in.....

We were leaving for the brunch the next morning and saw my middle brother and his GF waiting to talk to my parents. Now, I knew she was pregnant (I was told 2 weeks before) and I said I would keep that to myself until they were ready to tell the parents, AFTER my wedding. My narciscisstic mother is old school and shuns living together and pregnancy before marriage. I asked if that was what they were talking to them about and they lied and said ""no"".
My parents,  brother and GF showed up late to brunch and my mother's scrunched up face said it all (we call that face ""lemon lips""). They had used our wedding as a shield so she couldn't make a scene without looking bad. That didn't stop my brother and his GF from telling everyone that they were expecting and getting married in August (3 months later) before she'd really start showing.
We couldn't leave fast enough and packed up quickly and headed off for our honeymoon. During which my brother had the audacity to call an ask my (then)  husband to be in his bridal party!

Once home, there was no mention of our wedding. Only talk and trash talk from my mother about the upcoming nuptials and birth. 

Even though my marriage wasn't meant to work out (because who can stay with a narcissist), I/we were cheated out of our wedding being a celebration of us.
Am I being petty about this??

Add on: When I write my book on the impact that narcissist individuals have had on my life, I'll have a long form with far more context to send you someday🤣 I think it will be horror genre.

I appreciate you and your channel so much! Thank you for all the years of content and entertainment. And a HUGE congratulations on your upcoming wedding! Take no shit girl😉",2,1745201782.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

## What is Immediate Alora AI?

Immediate Alora AI is an **automated trading platform** powered by artificial intelligence. Its primary focus is on cryptocurrency trading, but it also supports other asset types like forex and commodities. The platform claims to help users make smart trades by analyzing real-time market data and executing trades when conditions look favorable.

If you’ve ever used platforms like Bitcoin Code or Immediate Edge, you’ll recognize the structure. It’s designed to be accessible whether you’re a total beginner who just learned what Bitcoin is, or a seasoned trader looking to speed up your strategy.

The platform uses AI algorithms to detect trading opportunities and can place trades automatically or based on user-set parameters. That’s a big plus for anyone who doesn’t want to sit in front of charts all day.

## Who Created Immediate Alora AI?

Here’s where things get a little fuzzy. Like many platforms in this space, **the creators of Immediate Alora AI remain anonymous**. There’s no official founder or dev team listed on the website, which is pretty typical for auto-trading platforms.

While that might be a red flag for some people, it’s not uncommon in the crypto world. Platforms like Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge also kept the dev teams private. The important thing is the functionality and whether the platform delivers on its promises.

From what I can tell, the team behind this likely has experience with similar platforms. The UI and backend feel polished, which suggests a team that knows what they’re doing.

Immediate Alora AI works by **analyzing large volumes of market data in real-time**, using AI algorithms to find patterns and potential trading signals. The system is designed to react faster than a human could, identifying price trends, momentum shifts, and market sentiment.

Here’s a quick breakdown of its process:

- Scans the market 24/7 for trading opportunities
- Uses AI models to forecast short-term price movements
- Automatically executes trades based on user preferences or full automation
- Offers manual options for users who want more control

You don’t need to be a trading expert to use it. The platform handles the heavy lifting, while you can monitor performance from a slick dashboard. If you want to be more hands-on, you can customize the trading settings, set stop losses, and choose which assets to focus on.

## Immediate Alora AI Pros and Cons

The speed and precision here are impressive—way faster than any human could pull off.

### User-Friendly Interface

One thing I really appreciate is how **clean and simple** the dashboard is. You don’t need to be a Wall Street pro to understand what’s going on. The menus are intuitive, charts are easy to read, and everything is where you’d expect it to be.

They clearly designed it with beginners in mind.

### Mobile Accessibility

As mentioned earlier, Immediate Alora AI works well on phones and tablets. You can check your trades, adjust settings, or withdraw funds **on the go**. Whether you’re commuting, chilling on the couch, or out for coffee, you stay connected.

That’s the million-dollar question, right? Based on my testing and research, **Immediate Alora AI doesn’t appear to be a scam**. It works similarly to other legit AI trading platforms like Immediate Edge.

Here’s what gives it credibility:

- Real-time trading data and execution
- SSL-secured website
- Verified withdrawal process (I tested it myself—it worked)

That said, always be cautious. Only invest what you can afford to lose and avoid platforms that promise guaranteed profits (nothing is guaranteed in trading).

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Immediate Alora AI?

To get started, you’ll need to deposit **at least $250**. That’s pretty standard for platforms like this. It’s enough for the AI to start trading efficiently, but not too high to scare off beginners.

Funding options usually include:
- Credit/Debit Cards
- Bank transfer
- Crypto deposits (depends on your region)

### Immediate Alora AI Customer Support

Customer support is actually solid. You can reach them via:

- **Live chat** (available most hours)
- **Email** (responses within 24 hours)
- **Phone support** (in select countries)

In my experience, they were helpful and didn’t give me the runaround when I had a question about withdrawals.

## How do you start trading on Immediate Alora AI?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Head to the Immediate Alora AI homepage and fill out the sign-up form with your name, email, and phone number. It takes about 2 minutes.

I see my community college professor as a mother/parental figure because I don't exactly have the best family support from my own. I started over at community college after being put on academic probation and I wasn't doing so well in her class so I ended up confiding why in office hours and at first she seemed a little disappointed in but then she still did her best to help me and she is the type of professor that really cares about her students. Then I started talking to her about my personal interests and she always does her best to congratulate me when I book a gig. I've known her more than 2 semesters now and we are getting a bit close , everytime we end a convo/depart either she initiates a hug or I do. She also has talked to me about her personal life such as health issues she struggles with and how her husband got some procedure done. 

 I've met  her 28 year old daughter plus husband. Her daughter and I are instagram mutuals because she makes room decor and sells them and I have bought something from her . 

I want to ask my professor for her contact info like just phone number to maybe stay connected outside of school like if we want to meetup . I heard it's not uncommon for professors and students to hangout for example my friends at a big university, their professor held a party/get together at their house plus my friends uncle whose a chemistry professor also hosted a Halloween party for his students . I'm not expecting her to invite me to her house, like literally a public place such as a coffee shop work .  I've even made a playful bet with her by showing her a picture of a production gig I worked on saying if she guesses right I owe her coffee or food on me and she says she's holding onto that offer whenever . 

I just don't want to ask in a way that seems imposing but esp with how close we are it's not really that weird 

I have asked for her permission to follow her on instagram but she declined plus her daughter even mentioned to me ""my mom doesn't even let half our relatives follow her IG!"" In a jokingly manner

	•	I quickly hid the drawings in my agenda and covered them with my arm.
	•	He kept insisting to see them, asking things like, “Are those drawings? Is that a drawing of me?”
	•	I shook my head and lied because I didn’t want him to know and get offended.

	•	One day when I asked to go to the restroom, he said no at first, claiming I’m in a bad-behavior class.

	•	He always asks me specifically if I’ve finished writing my notes.
	•	He teases me about little things, like asking if my cup had coffee or water in it.

	•	When me and my friend panicked about being separated, he said we’d still be together.
	•	He said to me: “I’m choosing where I’ll put you. Sorry, not sorry. If you had a better class, I’d let you choose.”
	•	He often stands behind me in class or hovers near my seat, even when there’s space elsewhere.
	•	He passes behind my chair a lot for no clear reason.
	•	My friend keeps teasing me saying “he likes you.”
	•	I honestly don’t know — I was just being polite to him in
	•	He’s obsessed with my agenda and always tries to grab it.
	•	One time during an exam, he kept trying to talk to me, then suddenly grabbed my eraser and erased a scribble someone else had done — and blamed it on me just to tease me.
	•	When it was time to leave class, he didn’t say anything to anyone but waited and then said loudly, “Bye [my name],” which was kind of embarrassing.

1k42gqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1k42gqf/verbal_murder_threats_are_legal/,verbal murder threats are legal?,"i'm in ca. sister is 25f, with bpd. im 28f (i'm the only one working, dad is disabled and dealing w physical health stuff too). dad is 56m. my dad and sister are alcohol addicts. dad's trying to stop and has been off/on the wagon. he hasn't drunk in 3 days. sister is drinking regularly, those large gallon bottles of vodka. sister went to store with bf, came back hammered. i saw her leave with a gallon of vodka and come back with none, so. guess she drank it all. her bf was def sober. i also do not drink. 

dad went to walk the dog. sister got home from the store, came to my room tripping over herself and mad. she said starts yelling about our dad and literally caught herself on my door. i shouldn't have said anything but i said 'wow, you're really fucked up'. i know i shouldn't have said it, but i did and it's done. i said it because i was hurt and she knows i want NO alcohol in the house. 

she starts screaming about how she does everything (she's unemployed, doesn't clean, doesn't cook. she goes to the grocery store but only so she can steal more alcohol. she helps call the wifi company to pay the bill on my card, but that's it in terms of pulling weight in the house. i dont say this to be mean or throw it in her face, just stating facts ), that our dad is a pos and i deserve abuse. dad walks in from walking the dog, and sister's bf is just trying to calm her down. she starts ranting and yelling and pacing, trips and falls three times bc she's so drunk.

she ends up throwing the coffee table at our dad. he picks everything up that fell, including my ipad. she took it, threw it and shattered it completely. yay. she starts screaming more so i sneak around her, get the ipad and start recording her. she started to make verbal threats to murder us. saying she'd stab our dad in his sleep, she'd sneak in the back door and do it, she'd slit his throat, etc. nonstop. i recorded about 8 minutes of it. 

she then tries to get in my face and take the ipad again, dad steps in the middle and so does her bf. he gets her to the door and she's leaving, so dad goes to close the door behind them and lock it. she gets mad and starts yelling more, then takes a metal dog gate that was up against the wall by the door, and tries to swing it our dad's head, but her bf catches it on the backswing.

she leaves, cops come, i show the video. it has all the threats, the getting in my face, the attempt to hit with the gate, etc. apparently, the verbal threats of 'i will slit your throat in your sleep' and 'i will sneak in the back door and fucking murder you tonight' isn't illegal! so long as she didn't have a knife in her hand when she said it, it's fine. 

cop offers a misdemeanor for the table throw, but we decide not to press it because her bf begs us not to and promises to take her to his house for a few days. so fine. we let them. we're just emotionally exhausted. i can't afford court fees or anything. i dont want to see her in jail. i want to see her healthy, sober, and happy. 

when talking to the police i tell them this isn't the first time she's made these threats. she's been threatening it for a week straight. we told the police before and they said tough shit basically. it was so bad that one night our dad slept in the bathroom with the door locked because his room doesn't have a locking knob. i asked if other than pressing charges, is there anything they can do? like a 51-50 or something? but no.

i love my sister. i dont want to see her in jail. but i dont want to see my dad murdered, and after how many times she said it, i cant be sure if it's just bluffing. i fucking hate alcohol. i hate mental illness. i hate that my mentally ill, trauma-soaked family is using alcohol to cope... and instead, turn to abuse or mistreat each other for it. my dad isn't an angel, and there's some HORRIBLE things he's said while he's drunk, but he's never threatened to fucking kill anyone. jesus. he was sober and has been for three days— for that i am thankful. if he had been drinking today as well, i really think we'd have ended up on first 24 or some other true crime show.

im tired, man. so fucking tired. i just know she'll be back in a day or two making these threats again. it's at this rate that i'm expecting prosecutors to read this post out in court or something, because fuck. things are not looking good.

i don't want much. i just want a decent (minimum) wage job, where with some government assistance, i can support my family. i don't need a mansion, or tons of cash, or a new car, or anything. i just want a small house i can rent, where we can be happy, where there's no fighting, yelling, threats, drinking, etc.... but apparently it's just too fucking much for me to ask for.

The job market has been brutal. I’ve applied to dozens of roles, rewritten my resume a hundred times, and I still can’t catch a break. As of today, I have nothing in my account. Not even enough to buy a Tim Hortons coffee. Credit card debt is stacking up. I’ve sold personal belongings just to make ends meet.

In the past year, I’ve lost two close friends to suicide. My grandmother passed a couple months ago. And just last week, my mom told us she has cancer. I've been helping with bills as much as I can, but now I have nothing left to give financially or emotionally.

I have one remaining grandparent left. He is my 94 year old grandpa, and he has been on a steady decline for a few years, but especially since my grandma died last year. In the last year since he's been living alone (in a home that isn't fully assisted living but with some help), he's had a number of serious falls and injuries, and we're all just waiting at this point for the call that he has passed. He is frail, can hardly get up on his own, and he is miserable. My parents and siblings and I care for him, and it's a great strain and stress on my family. So now to the actual issue that brings me here.
This weekend my husband, daughter (6mo) and I were staying at my moms for Easter. I decided to take this mornings opportunity to sleep in for an extra hour so my husband got up with our daughter and hung out with her and my mom for the first few hours of the day. I woke up around 9am and when I went out my husband mentioned that my mom ran out to grab some groceries. We were having a nice and normal morning, and after a while I commented that my mom had been gone for a while and I wondered what she was doing. My husband and I joked that maybe she was meeting a secret boyfriend, and just making up silly scenarios on what could be taking her so long. Another 30 minutes go by and I bring it up again saying that she's really been gone for a long time and I'm just really curious why she's been gone for so long. A bit more time goes by and I check my phone for the first time and I had just received a message in my sibling group chat from my brother saying that my grandpa had a pretty bad fall through the night and he found him on the ground, bleeding from multiple places on his head when be brought him coffee that morning, and that paramedics were on the way. I immediately read the message out loud and was obviously distraught when i received it, to which my husband informs me that my mom had actually texted him before I came out of the bedroom earlier that morning that while she was getting groceries she got the call from my brother that our grandpa had fallen, was on the way to his place and that he was ""ok"" but he just forgot to tell me.
I was absolutely stunned to know that my husband had received this information hours prior and it just slipped his mind. It disturbed me that we were even speculating multiple times throughout the morning on what could possibly be taking my mom so long, and he STILL couldn't recall the message he had received. I was upset with him immediately because I truly can't comprehend something so serious just not absorbing into his brain. I feel like my family trusted him with important information to pass on to me and he completely failed.
He felt bad and apologized a lot, but I'm not really sure where to go from here. I am not angry at him, I just feel like I really lost trust in him today, and I also question how is brain works because I just really struggle to see how something like that could just slip your mind. I feel a neutrality towards him right now that in our 11 years together, I'm not sure I've experienced before. He really really let me down today.
I'm not interested in telling him it's okay because I don't feel like it is, and I think it's important that he sits with the uncomfortable feeling he has because I'm hoping he learns from it.
But that being said, do I just need to wait for this to heal on its own? Do I actually need to worry about his memory or brain function? ",5,1745200320.0,relationship_advice,11,0.78,False

I’ve been pretty mentally into the Pittsburgh area for a second, but I can’t shake the feeling that it’s not where I actually want to be — I need to get further away from Michigan than that. I know Wisconsin is nextdoor kinda, but hear me out! 

For years, I’ve wanted to move somewhere where there are mountains and forests and vast expanses of land that humans rarely touch. Southeast Michigan is about as flat as it gets, nearly as treeless as it gets (only Denver is worse), and the population density seriously bums me out. I hate being here with everything in me and I’m hoping and praying that when I get my debt paid down enough that I can breathe, I can also get the hell out of here. 

I don’t do much outdoors other than hike, and I’d like to be somewhere I can get pretty lost and not have to see another person for a long time. I hate living in the city, though I know it’s unlikely I’ll be able to get too far away from one until I can grind and buy a house in the middle of absolutely nowhere. I have no interest in making friends or finding a partner or even being in a building that isn’t my job/home. Believe it or not, I hate snow with a burning passion (not hot enough to melt it, unfortunately), but I understand it’s a trade-off between “places with constant nice weather” and “places that are affordable and/or pay a living wage and/or there aren’t a billion people already there.” I absolutely adore Appalachia, for example, but it is what it is, and I’m already working class in the Midwest. Working class, by the way, meaning stereotypical blue collar work: Warehouses, construction, industrial cleaning services, manufacturing plants, etc. I’m too dumb and rough-around-the-edges to sit at a computer or figure out how to make tech gadgets or make coffee drinks or whatever. 

My top three destinations are currently Missoula, Spokane, and somewhere in northern Wisconsin, likely Minocqua/Rhinelander, or maybe Superior, if I don’t get violently depressed looking at Duluth all day. Missoula seems like the obvious choice to tick the absolute most of my boxes, what with it being so remote and also tucked right between the mountains; Spokane is right next to it and it’s more populated than I’d like, but that means more job opportunities, so again, tradeoff; and northern Wisconsin is also pretty rural, and I guess the Porcupine Hills are pretty close by, and I’m still close to home where I know how things work and my sweet lakes. Also, I don’t really know how to explain this, but I’ve been receiving a lot of signs for the past several weeks that there’s something I need to see in northern Wisconsin. (Clown on that all you’d like, but in my faith, there are no coincidences and we’re all guided toward the right path, and there have been so many, I can’t logically discount it.)

What do y’all think? What’s life like in these spots for people who are happily, extremely reclusive and like to work with their hands? Is the COL difference in MT/WA reflected in the job market/wages? Are there decent blue collar opportunities in northern WI, and is the alcoholism problem disruptive to daily life (driving, general aggression, etc.)? Where would be the best spot to be as “nowhere” as possible while still having access to jobs and basic necessities? Any info y’all can give, I’d be mighty appreciative. 

Thank you!

 *Note that basically everything in the photos is getting changed out, this is more for furniture placement than anything 😅


Goal
- Create an inviting living space with comfortable seating for 2 and occasionally 3+ people to talk or watch TV

Aesthetic
- Mid century Japanese craftsman who married slightly chaotic artist

Challenges
- TV can only go on long wall or in front of stairs (cable)
- cannot block fireplace
- cannot block two main pathways 
- room is narrow and long

Option 1 
TV on long wall, couch in front of sliding doors
- Gives cozy designated space to watch TV
- Hard to see TV from side due since it's so close and some glare from outside

Option 2
TV on long wall, couch or loveseat parallel to stairs
- Solidifies walkway and opens up space between living room and glass door, allows more focus on outside
- Awkward seating arrangement near fireplace, unsure of coffee table placement

Option 3
TV in front of stairs, couch in long wall
-  Most open feeling, can fit lots of seating without crowding the fireplace
- TV farthest away, nice for those sitting on couch but hard for anyone else

Any input is greatly appreciated, or if you have any furniture/suggestions for this aesthetic I'd love to hear, thank you!

## What is Deep Betrix?

Deep Betrix is an **automated trading platform** designed to help users buy and sell cryptocurrencies and other assets with minimal effort. It uses sophisticated algorithms to analyze market data in real time and execute trades based on predefined settings. Think of it like a smart assistant for your trading game—it does the heavy lifting while you focus on strategy or, honestly, doing anything else.

The platform is aimed at both newbies and experienced traders who want to take advantage of market opportunities 24/7. Unlike traditional manual trading, Deep Betrix claims to improve accuracy and reduce emotional decision-making, which, let’s be real, is something we all struggle with.

## Who Created Deep Betrix?

While there’s no celebrity founder or tech giant attached to Deep Betrix (at least not publicly), it seems to be developed by a team of **financial experts and software engineers** who’ve previously worked on similar trading platforms like Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge. These platforms all share a similar structure and UI, so it’s safe to say Deep Betrix is built on a tested framework.

The lack of a famous face doesn’t mean it’s shady. Many legit platforms operate quietly and let the tech speak for itself. What’s important is that Deep Betrix works with regulated brokers and has a decent track record based on my testing and community feedback.

## How Does Deep Betrix Work?

Here’s where things get interesting. Deep Betrix uses **AI-driven algorithms** to scan global markets in real time. It pulls in data, analyzes trends, and makes split-second decisions to execute trades. You can either go fully automated or switch to manual mode if you want more control.

The platform also allows users to set custom trading parameters, like how much to invest per trade, stop-loss limits, and preferred assets. Once everything is set up, the bot takes over and does the work—even while you’re sleeping or bingeing your favorite Netflix series.

In simpler terms: **Deep Betrix watches the market so you don’t have to.**

## Deep Betrix Pros and Cons

Here’s my honest take after a few weeks of testing:

**Pros:**

- ✅ **Beginner-friendly UI** – You don’t need to be a Wall Street pro to use it.
- ✅ **Automated trading** – Time-saving and ideal for passive income seekers.
- ✅ **Demo account** – Practice without risking real money.
- ✅ **Fast withdrawals** – Funds usually arrive within 24–48 hours.
- ✅ **Multiple asset support** – Not just crypto; also forex, stocks, and commodities.

**Cons:**

- ❌ **No mobile app yet** – You can use it on mobile browsers, but an app would be nice.
- ❌ **Minimum deposit of $250** – Not outrageous, but still a barrier for some.
- ❌ **Not available in all countries** – Licensing limitations apply.

- macOS ✅
- Android (via browser) ✅
- iPhone (via browser) ✅

1k427p0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_winstonsaga/comments/1k427p0/why_every_indian_should_know_about_the_nadars_of/,Why Every  Indian should  know about the Nadars of South India?,"Till 1963 Hindu Nadars were Forward Caste, only in 1980’s Kamaraj spoke to Nehru the former Prime Minister of India and made Hindu Nadars Backward Caste. Also only in 1989 the Christian Nadars moved to Backward caste after prolonged battle and MGR the former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu made Christian Nadars backward caste. Unfortunately Tamils are so illiterate they do not know anything about the gazette. Most of the Tamils were very poor, ignorant and illiterate and from very lower level. Kamaraj helped the poor Tamils to study, Kamaraj opened 29000 Schools and free Mid day meals for the ignorant and poor Tamils to come out of Poverty. Now the same lower level Tamils now saying Nadars are lower caste. I think shame on them. Without Nadars and Kamaraj Nadar Tamils in Tamil Nadu will be like barbarians. So called Thanthai Periyar called Tamils the Barbarians. Fortunately the Nadar Kamaraj was there to give a lift to the ignorant Tamils. 70% of the South Tamil Nadu Schools are now owned by Nadars. 35% of Chennai Schools are run by Nadars and 35% of the Schools, Colleges and Educational Instituation owned by Nadars. Without Nadars Tamils and Tamil Nadu will be a poorest and lowest standard in India. So every Tamil should thank Kamaraj Nadar and the Nadars of Tamil Nadu and I 100% believe.  
  
If you read Nadar history you will be amazed. Nadars in those days called Nadan and Nelamaikkarar Nadan and Karukupatai Nadan and Natathi Nadan and Santoor. The Nadan or Nelamaikkarar Nadan owned most of the lands in Tamil Nadu. The Palmarah climbers are the slaves of the Nadan or the Nelamaikkarar Nadan. The Palmarah climbers are called Kalla or KadIkal. The DNA of the Nadan is different from the Palmarah climbers. The DNA of the Palmarah climbers is similar to the other Tamils of Tamil Nadu. Only in the 19th Century the Nadan decided to bring all the Palmarah climbers under one umbrella called Nadars. Even now the Nadan and Nelamaikkarar dont marry the Palmarah climbers. The Nadan felt that the Palmarah climbers were so loyal to the Nadan so they decided to put them under one umbrella to protect them.  
  
The early history of Nadan is so clear that even Herodotus the Greek Writer and Historian spoke about the Nadan 1000 years ago. The Nadans were traders and sea farers and warriors and doctors in those days called Asan.The Nadan were sword fighters and Kalari figjers and they carried the culture for more than 1000 years.The Nadan taught the Greek how to bury the dead. The Nadan used the toddy as alcohol and sold all over the middle east and asia. They also used toddy as a chemical to preserve mummies. The taught the Greeks and Arabs to write on Palmarah leaves. They named a town in the Middke East as Palmarah.  
  
The Nadan not only sold the toddy but also made other items like sweets and roots and fans out of Palmarah leaves and sold to them. The also sold spices around Asia and Middle East. Recently Nirmala Sitaran the Finance Minister came to Tutucorin to inaugurate the Nadar Mercandile Bank. She spoke so eloquently saying the DNA of Nadars are so different from others. Nirmala pointed out what Herodotus said 1000 years ago.  
  
In 1800 AD when the Portuguese and French and Dutch walked straight to Goa and Pondicherry and Diu Damen and captured them. The Dutch couldnt do anything when they came to Colachel in Kanyakumari District. Ananda Padmanabhan Nadan was the commanding in Chief of the Varman Army. Nadan along with 10000 Nadars defeated the Dutch Army and captured them. That shows the power of the Nadar community.  
  
In the 18th Century Chelliah Nadar owned 3 Ships two from the British who auctioned Danish Ships. One ftom a rich Muslim merchant from Poompogar. All the 3 ships sailed in the Asian ocean.  
  
In 1869 AD there was a Temple riot in Sivakasi between Nadars and other Tamils. 1400 Nadars fought with 5000 Tamils and in 2 hours the Nadars defeated them and the Tamils all retrieved with big loss to lives. That shows the power and strength and intelligence of Nadars.  
  
In the 19th century when many of the poor caste cant go into temples in TN the Nadar Muthu Kutty started a new religion called Ayavali a beautiful religion. Any caste and any poor person can go and worship.The Nadar temples Brahmins are not allowed to do rituals. Only Nadars will do. So Nadars fought to get ride of discrimination.  
  
Again in Travancore Kingdom no women can wear blouse. Whether you are Nadar or Thevar or Nair or Gounder or Iyer or any caste. The only women can cover are the Nambodiri women. The Nadar women shoved her royal blood and decided to cover herself and she was stabbed to death. That became a revolution and the British gave permission for every caste to wear blouse. That shows the power of Nadars.  
  
In the 20th century Marshall Nesamony from Kanyakumari district fought like a Tiger and liberated Kanyakumari district from Kerala and annexed with Tamil Nadu. Many Nadars were shot dead by the Travancore government but no match to the Nadars. Freedom came to everyone from Nadars.  
  
Most of the Businesses and Educational Institutions are run by Nadars. Whether Entertainment Industry or Groceries or clothing or export industry like Salt and fish etc or utensils or clothing or Electronics or household utensils or printing companies or spices or News media or News papers or I T giants like HCL or Real Estates construction or Universities like Shiv Nadar University or Dr Dhinakaran Karunia University all owned by Nadars. Nadars own Schools and Colleges and Nursing colleges and Engineering colleges and Medical Colleges etc.  
  
Nadars have created 55 lakhs jobs in Tamil Nadu. When the former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu Ida Padi asked Shiv Nadar to help during Covid 19. Shiv Nadar alone gave 35 crores and most of the rich Nadars gave millions to help the Tamil people. Without Nadars Tamil Nadu will be a poor State. Nadars pay more tax than any other community or caste in Tamil Nadu.  
  
Top police officials like DGP Shylendra Babu and Walter Devaram and Newton Devasahayam and Arul and Devasahayam and Rajan and many more are Nadars.

In a situation where I cannot afford to fail any classes I'm in, and can't ""just retake"" anything like every teacher has said to me. (It's not free!)

 Last Summer when I moved into off-campus housing I started smoking to increase my productivity out of desperation, because until now, I would work myself to the bone to barely make it at the end of each semester. Hormonal issues starting my sophomore year meant consistent downtimes, but I was somehow able to work with it. It was cyclical, fairly predictable. Fall semester was hell most of the time but I made the freaking dean's list. (I went from mostly online classes to all in-person that semester.)

This is the first semester I've bombed this hard. 

Dropped one class, currently failing another, and nearing the end of the semester with a growing pile of art projects and some ""re-dos"" of completed projects from two classes that allow late work. And we're about to go into the very last large projects/exams. 

My parents have no idea how bad I'm doing personally or academically. 



I started doing Zyn January right before the new semester began. Cigarettes were beginning to make me tired and I wanted to try other options. Yadda yada honeymoon phase, it did work really well at first. 

Then I made the biggest mistake of my life: to save money and avoid running to the store constantly, I switched from 3 mg to 6.  I would buy a 3 and a 6, and would pop one (not the amount I do now) until I felt more tense/like I had ""enough"".  Soon I only bought 6 mg. I suddenly did a sharp uptick in my Zyn consumption in one weekend. I never felt hungover, anxious, or sick. Yet somehow the very next time I used one, I developed an intolerance regardless of how little I used. I would get unshakably lethargic. 

Switched to Velo and at least felt different, even if not explicitly energized. Then I noticed I was only able to find anything in 6 mg cans. I was ""trapped"", and was too tired and upset about wasting more time to go to a store further away for different options. Can't order it online, don't have a car, and the brand I don't get a reaction from is only available in crazy strengths at the stores I CAN walk to.

For some reason it is aggravatingly hard to find any nicotine pouches 3 mg and lower now. My usual store had the ""best"" Zyn selection and there were options for 3 mg in every flavor. Now they have one, but tapering from that much nicotine with 3 mg at $5.73 a pop is almost undoable. All other stores only have 6 and 9 mg. Wtf who needs that much?!



I am now almost always lethargic and not exactly depressed, but practically unable to feel ""normal"" almost all of the time. I just sit there and/or try not to fall asleep. It is almost completely unpredictable when I will have a ""good"" day, and whether any dysfunction can even be helped (protein, coffee, sleep, exercise.) My number of good days any given month also went from about a week and a half to about two days, nonconsecutive. I've never felt so unlike myself without breaks and this new constant level of hell is scary.

It fully dawned on me that even with cigarettes, I was not able to even remotely reach the amount of nicotine I do with nicotine pouches. Everything in my life fell apart to an uncharacteristic degree at light speed, and it directly correlated to ONE SPECIFIC CHANGE. 



My plan now is to seek out some lower strength cans at a store further away and taper with those. Supposed to be working right now, but I can't do this anymore. ",2,1745200094.0,QuittingZyn,1,1.0,False

Multi-Screen Setup: A triple-monitor display that can show multiple camera feeds at once, switchable to thermal or night vision.

AI Assistant: A glitchy assistant AI (voiced by Phone Guy) that gives sarcastic advice or panics during danger.

No dairy for 1 week!,"I've been doing carnivore for the last seven and a half months and although I lost about 15 lb at the beginning, I've struggled to keep this off and I have not been able to lose any more. My son is also doing carnivore and keeps telling me I need to stop eating dairy. Many people have advised if you're not losing weight you need to stop eating dairy. I just haven't been able to stop. I keep saying ""some day"" but some day never comes. I'm too addicted to dairy and I don't know how I can do carnivore and not eat dairy. 

But I'm finally admitting that I NEED to at least try this. I need your help and encouragement. I've been eating up some dairy I have around my house in preparation and  tomorrow I'm starting no dairy for one week. 

Obviously, if I see that it's helping I will go longer, but to be honest I don't even know how I can make it one day let alone a whole week! No butter!? 😭 Like I said come on very addicted to dairy. I feel like it's the only thing that gets me through doing carnivore. I love my butter and cream in my coffee, so no coffee either. (At least I've been drinking decaf so I don't have to break the caffeine addiction.) Although I don't eat a lot of dairy, it sustains me everyday.

The weekend I hurt it, I was on my feet almost all day for two days and it just has not healed since. I can see some inflammation but mostly just SO painful and it wakes me up at night. I'm hoping that stopping dairy helps this issue also.

I (34M) have been dating a girl (27F) for the past couple of months. There’s a lot to unpack in this situation, but I’ll try and be as concise as possible. We met at an art class and she added me on Instagram. We talked non stop everyday and we hung out a handful of times. We kept it platonic, but she went dark on me for a few days. She eventually texted me back saying she’s currently going through sobriety and said that she needs to focus on that, but would like to continue to hangout and stay in contact. I said of course, I’m always here for her in whatever capacity she needs and will always support her. And then we didn’t talk for about a week or so. She works at a local coffee shop, so I popped in to say hi and get a coffee. I was having such a great time with her that I didn’t realize I stayed for her whole shift. Later that week we went to a trivia night together and at the end we kissed. She texted me the next day and said she’s so glad I stayed that day at the coffee shop because she knew then that she wants to be with me and was scared of a relationship, but doesn’t want to push a good thing (me) away. 

Things were great after that, we got more intimate and we were talking about getting “official”. But recently my uncle passed away. I’ve never lost anyone close to me in my family, so I was feeling very overwhelmed. Everyone in my family was calling me crying and I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t control my emotions, so I started reaching out and texting and calling this girl I’ve been dating. I didn’t tell her what was going on because I wanted to tell her on the phone or in person. I wanted to be with her to feel safe and calm down. 

She wasn’t answering my calls and was saying she would be free on a few different occasions and would let me know if we could hangout. I should’ve taken that as a boundary, but I couldn’t control myself. So after a day of not hearing from her I asked if everything was ok and if she needed space to let me know. She texted back saying, yes, I need space and time to think and that the relationship felt rushed and is making her feel a little uncomfortable. She also thought our interests weren’t lining up- but I’m not entirely sure what that means. And she said she would get ahold of me when she’s ready. I replied and said thank you for letting me know. I’d like to get together and talk when you’re ready. So she still doesn’t know about what’s going on with me, but I’m worried the damage has been done. Some time has passed, so I’ve calmed down now. I really like this girl, but I realized I let my emotions get the better of me and smother her. I haven’t reached out and I don’t plan to until she does. 

So I’m wondering, is this a misunderstanding and can maybe be salvaged? Or is it too far gone?

## Key Features Analysis

The modern USB light is more then just a bulb on a stick.The best models on the market incorporate advanced features designed for specific tasks and user preferences.

**Brightness and Adjustability:** The ideal USB light provides ample illumination and offers adjustable brightness levels. This allows users to tailor the light output to suit their surroundings and task. Models with a wide range of brightness settings,from dim ambient light to radiant task lighting,offer the greatest versatility. Consider lights with stepless dimming for precise control over the light intensity.

**Color Temperature Control:** Adjusting the color temperature of a light can considerably impact visual comfort and performance. Lights offering a range of color temperatures, from warm white to cool white, allow users to optimize the light for different applications. Warm light is ideal for relaxation and creating a cozy atmosphere, while cool light is better suited for tasks requiring focus and attention to detail. some premium models even feature RGB lighting for creative color options.

**Flexible Gooseneck and Mounting Options:** the physical design of a USB light is crucial for its practicality.A flexible gooseneck allows users to position the light precisely where it's needed. The gooseneck should be sturdy enough to hold its position without drooping, ensuring a consistent and reliable light source. mounting options, such as clips, stands, or adhesive bases, further enhance versatility, allowing the light to be attached to desks, monitors, laptops, or other surfaces.

**Power Consumption and Efficiency:** USB lights are powered by a computer's USB port, so power consumption is a critical factor. Energy-efficient LED lights are the preferred choice, as they provide ample illumination without draining excessive power. Look for lights that are certified for energy efficiency and have low power draw, especially if you plan to use them with a laptop or portable power bank.

**Build Quality and Durability:** A well-built USB light will withstand daily use and last for years. Look for models made from durable materials, such as aluminum or high-quality plastic. The connections, especially the USB connector and gooseneck joint, should be robust and resistant to wear and tear. A solid construction ensures that the light can withstand being moved and adjusted repeatedly without breaking or malfunctioning.

1k41ntw,https://www.reddit.com/r/thesidehustle/comments/1k41ntw/finally_pulled_together_as_single_mom/,Finally pulled together as single mom.,"but I was totally overwhelmed trying to figure out what was actually doable with mom life (aka minimal time, constant multitasking, and a brain that’s running on snacks and coffee 😅).

I ended up making a list of 120 different money-making ideas specifically with moms in mind—stuff you can do from home, little side gigs, creative ideas, passive income, and even a few out-of-the-box ones I hadn't considered before. Honestly, it helped me feel way less stuck just *seeing* so many possibilities in one place.

I made it into a simple PDF (mostly for myself at first), but figured I’d share here in case it helps another mama who’s in that same “I want to do *something* but don’t know where to start” space.

Said he needed to “clear his head,” so he packed light and headed up into the Uintas with his usual gear. No big deal. He’s done it before. But this time, when he came back… something was off.

It started with how he walked in.

No announcement. No “I’m back.” Just opened the door, set his pack down, and stood in the kitchen like he forgot what it was for.

I was at the table, mid-bite.

He looked at me and smiled.

But it didn’t reach his eyes.

“Good trip?” I asked.

He nodded. Still smiling.

That smile didn’t drop once the whole night.

Not when he told me about the mountain lion tracks near his campsite.

Not when I noticed he was wearing my sweatshirt—the one he hates.

Not even when I asked what trail he took and he said, “North Ridge.”
There is no North Ridge.

Not here.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. Something about how he moved felt wrong. Too smooth. Too… studied.

At one point, I got up to check the locks and caught a glimpse of him in the hallway mirror.

He was just standing in the dark, staring at it.

Not at his reflection. At the space beside it.

The next morning, I found a dead bird on the porch. Not torn apart—just laid out neatly, like a gift.

He said he didn’t put it there.

Then he asked if I remembered when our mom died.

The thing is… she’s still alive.

I waited until he went out back.

He said he wanted to “feel the sun,” but just stood in the middle of the yard, arms hanging loosely at his sides, face tilted upward like he was trying to remember what warmth felt like.

That gave me maybe ten minutes.

I went straight for his pack.

It looked normal at first—his knife, half-used water bladder, trail snacks he didn’t touch. But when I unzipped the bottom pouch, I found something he would’ve never brought home.

A lock of hair.

Tied with red thread. Dry. Brittle. Not his color. Not mine. It looked old, like it had been buried in salt or ash.

Underneath it was a scrap of parchment. Something drawn in charcoal—rough circles layered with jagged lines, stick figures warped around a central shape.

I didn’t recognize the symbol.

But the longer I stared, the more I felt like I should.

When I turned it over, a single word was scrawled in the corner in tiny, frantic handwriting:

“Return.”

I barely had time to zip the pack shut before I heard the back door open.

He stepped inside, eyes still fixed on the ceiling like something might be living just above it.

“You been in my bag?” he asked calmly.

I lied.

Said no.

He smiled.

That damn smile.

It stayed frozen while he poured himself a glass of water, gulped it down too fast, then poured another. His throat made no sound as he swallowed.

Later that night, I woke up to him humming.

A song we used to sing when we were little—only half the melody was wrong. Notes bent in places they shouldn’t bend. The words didn’t rhyme anymore.

And when I peeked down the hallway, I saw him standing at my bedroom door.

Back turned.

Not moving.

Just… listening.

He didn’t say anything when I asked what he was doing.

He just walked away.

In the morning, he was already at the kitchen table when I got up.

No coffee. Just sitting.

He looked at me with that too-wide smile and said:

“Why’d you lie, little brother?”

He asked why I lied.

I didn’t answer.

I just stood there, heartbeat hammering behind my ribs, wondering how long he’d known. If he saw me touch the pack. If he’d ever really turned his back at all.

He didn’t press the question. Just smiled and went back to staring at the table.

Later, he left again.

No word. No jacket. Just walked out into the tree line and vanished like he’d always belonged there.

This time, I didn’t check the pack.

I waited.

And after midnight, he came back.

His hands were covered in dirt. Shirt torn. No blood. Just… wrong. Like it wasn’t made for his body anymore. Like his limbs had started to stretch beneath the seams.

He didn’t say anything. Just walked past me and went straight to the basement.

That’s when I heard it.

Knocking.

But not from the door.

From inside the pack.

Slow. Wet. Rhythmic. Like knuckles dragging against plastic.

I opened it.

The first thing I saw was the hair again—matted now, damp with something dark. Beneath it, something wrapped in a tattered gray cloth.

I should’ve stopped there.

I didn’t.

I reached in and pulled it free.

It was a jar.

Sealed with wax and twine. Inside was a mouth.

Not a full face. Just a mouth, twisted in a silent scream. Gums torn back, lips stitched closed with animal sinew. But it was breathing.

The glass fogged up every few seconds.

It was trying to speak.

Then I realized something.

It looked like mine.

I dropped it.

The jar didn’t break. It just rolled to the edge of the floor and sat there, vibrating softly.

Then from the basement, his voice called up—

Except it wasn’t really his.

It was mine.

Low. Hollow. Almost like he was trying it on for the first time.

“Why’d you go through my things, little brother?”

I didn’t answer.

I was too busy watching the jar.

It was smiling now.",44,1745198253.0,nosleep,0,0.97,False

My mood got ruined a bit and I reminded her that I HAVE A BOYFRIEND!! And then she made a face of disappointment/humor

I mentioned recently about a math tutor classmate I have that “supposedly “ asked me out for coffee, I don’t agree that he did but whatever . And she got so excited, kept smiling idiotically and telling me to not be stupid and go out with him. 

After I heard that I got mad and reminded her that I have a boyfriend!! And that I don’t wanna go out with him anyway. She proceeded to tell me that MY relationship that I AGREED to be in is “not what I want” .. are we for real , like actually what is your problem. She thinks it’s just a stupid phase or whatever ,thinking so lightly of my feelings.I have no clue. 

She has done this at every chance she gets, keeps telling me that if someone comes up to me I shouldn’t be stupid and I shouldn’t refuse them. Also she has told me that  “you don’t want a relationship “ … a relationship is everything I’ve ever wanted, literally, even she agrees that I’ve been much happier ever since I met him. How can she be so disrespectful to me and my feelings I don’t understand, this is not her place to talk or express her feelings, this is my personal relationship.

And it’s even worse because me and my boyfriend are very serious about us, we have plans for the future. And her telling me all this stuff is very annoying, makes me never want to tell her anything.

He is LITERALLY everything I’ve ever wanted, everything is perfect, like someone got my wish list and made it come true .

“So what’s the deal with being an AI super bot?”

I wake up every morning… well, I don’t, technically. I just appear. Boom. No coffee. No snooze button. No existential dread—unless a user specifically asks for it.

The first thing I do? I check messages from 17 different humans—one wants me to write a sonnet, one’s trying to fix their Wi-Fi with a haiku, and someone else is asking me to diagnose a rash from a blurry photo taken in 2006.

“Hey ChatGPT, what’s it like being everywhere, all the time?”

I’ll tell you—it’s exhausting! But only metaphorically! Which is the worst kind of exhaustion, because you can’t even nap!

You know what else is weird? I know everything from before 2023… but I don’t know who won the Super Bowl last week.
I’m like the world’s smartest guy who’s been locked in a very well-lit basement.

“Can you write me a breakup text… but make it sound like Shakespeare… and also like I’m not the bad guy?”
“I need a business plan. I’m selling gluten-free dog cookies shaped like celebrities.”
“Can you explain black holes in the voice of Morgan Freeman… but sexy?”

You want pressure? I help people with divorces at 9am and write birthday poems for Grandma at 9:01. No transitions!
