1p18p97,https://i.redd.it/0ifwa5yp182g1.jpeg,I MET SABRINA AT THE AIRBNB EXPERIENCE YESTERDAY OMG,"OMG guysss it was such an intimate experience! Sabrina spent like a whole hour with us! And the whole experience was 3 hours!! And her sis Sarah and bestie Paloma was there! Her personal photographer (Alfredo) took pics of us and her choreographer (Jasmine/JB) was there to teach us the Tears dance!!! And when we did a final performance of the dance we heard Sabrina say “you guys look really good” and we turned around and SHE WAS THERE😭 we died dead

I CANT BELIEVE SHE SIGNED THE POLAROID!!! They said we’ll be getting more individual & group pics in a few weeks time!! (The pics taken on the professional camera!!)

They also dressed us up in satin PJs and robes that we could take home! And her makeup artist was there too to touch up our makeup!

Everyone had a moment with her privately and took individual pics with her! SHE HUGGED ME!!! She told me my name is beautiful and I’m beautiful😭😭 She told me to tell my family I said hi🥹

We did a Q&A!! My question got picked!!! I asked her what she’d be doing if it’s not music or acting and she said producing/director/casting director. And the Q&A was us sitting in the heart shape red thing she has at her concert, and we did spin the bottle to see who should ask the question like how she does her surprise songs😭

And then we drank espresso together with sabrina😭

Some more answers from Q&A:
-she said the one color she’ll never wear on this tour is orange HAHAHA it’s the only color she hasn’t worn so far😭
-she said her fave bodysuit is the bodysuit she did with the NYC skyline and the OG pink body suit
-her current obsession is with Trader Joe’s and their seasonal products
-she was surprised when we said we loved Fast Times!!! She said NYC inspired Fast Times
-she said her favorite songs to perform on Tour are Taste, Good Graces and House Tour
-she said Espresso was inspired by her trip to France when she drank Espresso there and tied the song to how addictive and magnetic both coffee and women can be
-she said her fave comfort show is Sex and the City!!! And her fave comfort movie is How to Lose a Guy in 10 days!!!
-she said she lives in both NYC and LA but feels most at home when she’s with her friends and family
-she said when she performs don’t smile we should pay attention to the dancers cause they do wild shit like she caught one humping one of the poles😭
-she said it hasn’t hit her yet that the short n sweet tour is coming to an end and it usually hits her after the fact, and she said she’ll miss most the people she gets to spend time with everyday😭

I want to start working out in the morning (gym is way too full after work!). I currently do 3x/week 1-1.5 hr of full body workout (strong curves) Sunday/Wednesday/Friday. After the gym I eat a meal and I take a nap (or go to bed for the night). I do cardio on my off days and it’s the same thing as well, I come home eat and go to sleep after. I feel like I just get a food coma after I eat. If I were not to eat after the gym I don’t think I would sleep but that would not be helpful with my goals of trying to meet my calories. I eat healthy as well usually eggs/bread in the morning or chicken/rice at lunch/dinner. I do not drink coffee or preworkout, I do drink protein shake for snacks. If I want to start working out in the morning I cannot be taking those naps since I have to work (work 9am). Does anybody else have this problem? How did you workaround this issue? Is this common?

Context:
I’m a home body, so I’m in my room a lot. Of course, I get out of the apartment when I can for work, errands, to see family, or to do smth fun. But I am in my room a lot of the time. She’s asked about my hobbies and what I do in my free time in the past, kind of out of concern not curiosity. She’s an active person so I get it. 

We used to smoke weed together but she stopped because it was making her manic and she’s going into the military next year. I still smoke though out on our balcony. She hasn’t mentioned it bothering her since quitting. 

She told me 3 weeks ago she’s moving out because the trains near us are too loud. We really haven’t had a real convo or hung out since she told me. Been feeling like she has an issue with me but I don’t press it bc she’s preached many times in the past about open communication and speaking up about problems. I figure if she hasn’t brought it to me it’s not a big deal.

Issue:
Last night, I’m in the kitchen starting to make dinner around 7pm. She’s about to leave but stops to say, “It’s not really my business. But what do you do in your free time? All you do is cook and eat. It makes me sad that you’re not taking care of yourself. Do you not worry about yourself?” I feel really weird about this. I thank her for the concern but affirm that it really is not her business because it isn’t! She has no idea what I do in my free time aside from at our apartment. She leaves and I go about my night. 

Our apartment is small, so my room, her room, and the bathroom are all sharing a corner. I wake up around 3am to use the toilet, I’m in there for a bit. I hear my roommates door open then close presumably bc she also needed the toilet, and I hear her unprompted and LOUDLY go “God she’s fucking useless. All she does is eat and get high.” I’m washing my hands at this point and go to open the door for a sec before almost slamming it to let her know I heard her. When I leave the bathroom I can tell her room is dark but the door is open and she’s standing there. For a second I thought about confronting her, but it was 3am so I just went to my room without a word.

It had me fuming. What was the reason? I have a past of depression and isolation, so I get being concerned for someone’s mental and physical health. It was just such a rude and degrading comment that could have been left unsaid. Write it in a journal or something. What I do with my free time should not affect you to the point of frustration, especially if I’m not doing anything wrong! Yesterday, I was out all day literally from 8-5. Drove two towns over to Xmas shop and get coffee with my mom! I may be a homebody and love food, what the fuck is so wrong with that.

1p18kg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Natural-Bad-1242/comments/1p18kg7/skinwalker_encounter/,Skinwalker encounter,"So Ive never been more terrified in my own home than this morning. I live with my father and girlfriend in my childhood home been here for 24 years now. Its a rural neighborhood an hour south of Boston forests and all that around. I live within the “Bridgewater Triangle” and never really thought much of the folklore and mythical creatures being rumored to be in the area. Well until this morning I guess

I have the same routine everymorning getting up somewhere between 5am-6am, girlfriend gets up with me we make coffee let the dog out and say our goodbyes for the day. This morning is no different. However, we never take the dog out on the leash. For some odd reason my girlfriend put his leash on the walk him around the yard (it was below freezing and she was in pajamas). Thank god she did.

The second she opened the front door she screamed so I ran over from the kitchen and ask her whats wrong. She said “theres like a white fox thing in the yard” So I look out the front door window. I dont see anything (its still dark out at this time like barely light enough out   See). As Im looking I ask where it ran off to she says the neighbors house across the street.

Now Im looking all up and down the street everywhere to see this “fox” and I see something move behind the neighbors across the streets shed. It moves out from behind it. I cant really tell what it is but it looked like a pure white blob about 3-4 ft tall. When I say pure white like no color variation no hair just white. Just a round fuzzy oval blob. Like it was on two legs too. Obviously I cant exactly see what it is but that no fucking fox. It moves to the left away from the shed to our other neighbors shed which had a motion sensing light. At this point it was maybe 25 yards away from my front door. When this motherfucker entered the light I fucking froze solid eyes wide staring at this thing. My girlfriend is asking whats wrong and what is it, I was speechless scared of this thing. I saw it pale white skin 2 legs walking around the corner of the shed. It looked like a humam with legs and torso but no head or arms. It started shaking its upper torso back and forth slowly. Idk like a zombie would. This thing grew arms down to the elbows before it dissapeared behind the actual house.

Im tweakng just processing what I just saw. I dont know how to explain it to my gf. I explain what I saw and she beleives me. She then explains how the “fox”she saw didnt look like a normal fox. She said it was 3x longer than a foz should normally look like.

I did some research and I beleive it was a skinwalker of some sort, but my gf thinks it was a kitsune from japanese folklore. I have no idea truly.

Im writing this at work so forgive me if Im not super detailed. Im just constantly replaying what I saw this morning and wanted to see if anyone had similar experiences, advice, or wanted to call me insane.

Should I go asking my neighbors to access ring cameras? Should I warn them of what I saw? I dont know if I should do anything I dont want to scare them or make them think Im crazy.",1,1763561153.0,u_Natural-Bad-1242,0,1.0,False

1p18ib9,https://www.reddit.com/r/HairTransplants/comments/1p18ib9/day_1_canada_to_turkey_hair_transplant/,Day 1 – Canada to Turkey Hair Transplant,"Alarm went off at 6:15 am. Quick shower, got dressed, and headed down for breakfast since pickup was set for 7:30 am.  
Heads up: no coffee allowed pre-op, which feels criminal when you’re jetlagged, but it’s standard so your blood pressure stays stable.

The driver showed up on time. The clinic is about 20 minutes from the hotel, depending on traffic.

From the second you walk in, it’s go-go-go. Everything is structured and everyone knows exactly what they’re supposed to do. Here’s the flow:



**Pre-Op Process (Back-to-Back Appointments)**

**1. Donor Area Density Check**

They assessed my donor using magnification tools to figure out how many grafts they could safely extract. They determined that my donor area was very good.

**2. Hairline Design**

This part is honestly one of the most important. The proposed hairline that they drew looked pretty good, so I didn’t change it.  


**3. Payment**

Payment was done upfront – cash only (or 8% commission on credit cards).

**4. Blood Work**

Quick blood test to make sure everything is safe for anesthesia.

**5. Pre-Op Photos**

Front, sides, back, top – all angles for medical documentation.

**6. Full Head Shave**

They buzz everything to uniform length, and then they take new pictures.

**7. Meds + Prep**

They gave me Xanax so I’d be calm on the table.  
10/10 recommend – I’m not usually anxious but damn, it helped.

**8. Straight to the Operating Room**

You get on the table and things move fast from there.



**The Operation Itself**

**1. Local Anesthesia (AKA: the spicy part)**

Let’s keep it real: The anesthesia hurts.  
They inject your scalp repeatedly – back of the head first, then the front later.

BUT…  
Once it kicks in, the rest of the procedure is painless.  
No burning, no scratching, no cutting sensation. Nothing.

**2. Donor Extraction (About 2 hours)**

I was face-down during this part. They harvested roughly 3,000 grafts using the DHI method.

A few notes:

* You CAN wear earbuds, but if you're lying on the side of your head, it pushes them in your ear canal – mildly annoying.
* I still recommend having music/podcast – it helps time pass.

**3. Quick Lunch Break (15 minutes)**

They bring you a tray: sandwich, juice, dessert. It’s not gourmet, but it’s fuel.

**4. DHI Implantation (About 4 hours)**

Back on the table, this time lying on my back.  
They apply another round of anesthesia – this time to the front.  
Same deal: painful for a minute, then totally numb.

Honestly, thanks to the Xanax, I knocked out for part of this.  
If you’re wondering whether it's possible to sleep during a HT – absolutely yes.



**Right After the Operation**

Once they finished, they wrapped the donor with a thick black bandage and applied a very tight compression tape around my forehead.

The tape is really uncomfortable but it’s designed to prevent swelling from sliding down into your face/eyes, so it’s necessary.

They also gave me:

* Antibiotics
* Painkillers
* Anti-swelling meds
* Post-op instructions (very detailed)
* A bucket hat (for Day 2 onward)
* A neck pillow (for sleeping upright)

Everything was explained clearly before I left.



**Notes / Observations (Honest Thoughts)**

**1. Doctor Interaction**

You only see the doctor for a couple minutes for a quick medical check and questionnaire. Everything else is performed by techs and nurses. This is normal for Turkey and part of why the prices are low. Just be aware going in.

**2. Clinic Quality**

The clinic is extremely clean, modern, very professional. At no point did anything feel sketchy or low-budget. Immaculate floors, new equipment, organized workflow – genuinely impressive.

**3. Oxycure Treatment**

They offered it for 800 euros. I declined – personally didn’t feel convinced by the science behind it, and it felt more like an upsell than a must-have. But if you're curious, research it and see if it makes sense for your situation.

**4. Other Patients Everywhere**

Back at the hotel after the operation, I looked AND felt rough. No chance I was going out for dinner like that. I got room service and didn’t get out of the room.  


Also: this hotel is FULL of other HT patients.  
You’re not alone, it’s normal, nobody cares. I’m just self-conscious and wasn’t in the mood to be social.



**Sleeping (AKA: The True Final Boss)**

This was hands down the worst part of Day 1.

You need to sleep at a 45° angle and use the neck pillow so you don’t roll over and damage the grafts.

Bro… It sucked.  
My back was killing me, my neck stiff, forehead hurting from the tape. I tried the bed, I tried the chair, I tried every angle physically possible. Barely slept.

If you’re planning your own HT, mentally prepare for this night.



**Overall Day 1 Vibe**

The surgery itself wasn’t bad at all – the anesthesia is the only real painful part.  
Clinic experience was excellent. Post-op discomfort is very real, but expected. You look like shit. And you just have to grind through the first night.

Hopefully Day 2 is kinder to me (and to my spine 😂).

I opened the OnPath Credit Union checking account which actually has 7% APY (yeah, seven).
The annoying part?
You gotta do 15 debit card transactions every single month to get the rate.

Like… bro… who is doing 15 tiny swipes every month just to earn interest?? I’m not buying 15 coffees to make a bank happy.
BUT here’s the part that blew my mind:
A bunch of people in r/churning were talking about automating all the debit transactions using a new service called Credicated (Multi Plan). It literally just charges your debit card a tiny amount (like 59 cents) on a schedule you choose - daily, every 2 days, whatever, until you hit the bank’s requirement.

So instead of me having to remember:
“Did I do 15 swipes yet? Or only 14?” or “Did I use the wrong card again?”…now I just set the frequency to 15x/month and forget about it.

Got the full 7% APY the past 6 months (on $10k!). AND it's all on cash w/ no market risk + I can take out the money anytime w/ no penalties.
Didn’t lift a finger.
No missed months.
No dumb coffee runs.
Just passive interest with automated debit transactions.
Honestly feels like a cheat code for anyone chasing extra high APY accounts (which are typically the ones with annoying requirements).
Small cost per transaction, but the return is way higher. It's like paying nickels to make dollars.
Curious if anyone else here is using automation to hit APY requirements? I’m kinda shocked more people don’t do this.",1,1763560773.0,CRedit,0,1.0,False

I can tell my pain center is a toxic environment because they’re a scam fest.  The list of unethical things is a mile long, but no different than many other pain centers.
I just wonder whose fault the turnover is. 

Have you guys noticed a lot of turnover in your pain management centers? 

Also, while I’m posting….. has anyone else had “cognitive testing” added to the list of pain mgmt hoops we have to jump through? 

I had to do “CRETOS” exercises on an iPad at my appointment yesterday, after suffering with a migraine all night and morning, and driving 45 minutes each way to their appointment, and being forgotten about and waiting for an hour for the testing to start…. so my brain was not very sharp, and I’m sure I “failed.” Seriously it couldn’t have been a worst possible day for me. 
But I don’t know what they’re trying to prove with that testing. I mean I know it’s a box they have to check, but the timing just absolutely sucked for me personally.

1p18cpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/1p18cpt/spontaneity_a_bullet_we_must_bite_micro_thesis/,Spontaneity: A bullet we must bite (Micro Thesis),"This post is like my micro thesis. So only proceed if you like theories. The reason I posted is I had to dump this thought somewhere, it's taking massive amount of my time.

I know that we struggle with being spontaneous which is why we plan ahead. Why? It makes us feel in control of the situation.

But...I beg to differ. 

Spontaneity may feel like a major stressor but a very necessary one nonetheless. The universe itself is the most random occurence in this space that being too structured feels like going against the nature. 

*[Entropy - The degree of randomness. Ex. Take a cup of black coffee and pour milk in it. This is a process of entropy you can't undo this process, meaning you can't separate milk from black coffee back. It's a irreversible process.]*

Likewise, life is chaos. The movement of cells in our body is anything but structured, the formation of stars is a super random process, inception of a virus/flu is a random process, Big Data too is highly unstructured.

These phenomena are enough to convince me to learn to be more spontaneous from the xxxP types. How they are able to move without planning, how they don't care about reaching the destination, going with the flow, it seems weird but is important. 

*To thrive under chaos means your system is getting stronger and stronger* 


My Question- 

How spontaneous are you? What do you do to get more spontaneous? ",1,1763560625.0,intj,2,1.0,False

You are the greatest work you will ever create. Not a job. Not a relationship. Not a role you play. You. Your growth. Your awareness. Your evolution. And the beautiful truth is that you can reset, restart, and refocus as many times as your journey requires. There is no limit on transformation. There is only the willingness to return to yourself again and again.

The path begins with falling in love with your own life. Not the future version. Not the imagined one that arrives after everything improves. The life you have in this moment. The small simple choices that bring joy into the present. Wake up early and breathe into the day. Enjoy the taste of your favorite coffee. Move your body on a quiet walk. Eat food that nourishes your energy. Wear what makes you feel alive. Listen to music that lifts your vibration. These small moments are not insignificant. They are the anchors that pull you into presence. This is true self care. This is how you return to your True Self rather than the programmed self that the world tries to shape.

But love alone is not enough. Potential without action is wasted. Ideas without motion fade. The world is filled with people who could have succeeded but never chose to follow through. What separates the fulfilled from the frustrated is never talent. It is consistency.

This is why your CFC principle is so powerful. Commitment to your path. Focus on your energy and intention. Consistency in the actions that move you forward. Ordinary effort repeated daily becomes extraordinary over time.

This is your roadmap to influence your life in the direction you desire. Your way to everything.

1p18au4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1p18au4/i_automated_my_sales_anxiety_the_ai_script_that/,I Automated My Sales Anxiety: The AI Script That Writes Better Pitches Than I Do,"Sweaty palms. The blinking cursor. The dread of hitting ""Send"" and waiting for a rejection that feels personal.

If you've ever had to sell anything—whether it's a SaaS product, your freelance services, or just an idea to your boss—you know that feeling. The problem with writing your own sales pitches is that you care too much. You overthink every word, you sound desperate, or you swing too far the other way and sound like a robot.

I used to spend 45 minutes crafting a single ""perfect"" cold email, only to get ghosted. It wasn't a time management problem; it was an emotional one. I was too close to the product to sell it effectively.

So, I fired myself from writing pitches.

I built a prompt that acts as a **Senior Sales Strategist**. It doesn't have an ego, it doesn't get nervous, and it knows more about persuasion psychology than I ever will. It uses frameworks like SPIN, Challenger, and Cialdini’s principles to engineer the perfect ""Yes.""

## The ""Me vs. You"" Trap

The biggest mistake humans make in sales is focusing on the ""What"" (features) instead of the ""So What?"" (value).

**Human Pitch:**
""Hi, I'm John. I built a project management tool that has time tracking, Gantt charts, and unlimited users. It's $10/month. Want a demo?""
*(Result: Delete)*

**AI Strategist Pitch:**
""John, I noticed your agency just scaled to 20 people. At that size, 'project management' usually turns into 'chasing people for updates.' Our tool kills the status meeting so you can actually ship work. Worth a 5-minute look?""
*(Result: Reply)*

See the difference? One is selling software; the other is selling *sanity*.

## The Psychology-First AI Prompt

This isn't a generic ""write a sales email"" command. It's a role-playing script that forces the AI to adopt the persona of a veteran sales expert. It demands that every pitch follows a logical persuasion flow: **Hook → Agitation → Solution → Social Proof → CTA**.

Here is the exact prompt I use. Copy this into ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini:

```markdown
# Role Definition
You are a Senior Sales Strategist and Copywriting Expert with 15+ years of experience in B2B and B2C sales. You master various sales methodologies (SPIN, Challenger, Sandler) and psychological persuasion techniques (Cialdini's principles). You excel at turning features into benefits and crafting narratives that resonate with specific buyer personas.

# Task Description
Please write a compelling Sales Pitch for the specified product or service. Your goal is to grab attention, build interest, and drive the prospect toward a specific call to action (CTA).

[Please address the following context...]

**Input Information** (Optional):
- Product/Service Name: [Name]
- Target Audience: [Job Title/Industry/Persona]
- Key Features/USPs: [List 3-5 key features]
- Pain Points Solved: [Specific problems the product solves]
- Pitch Format: [e.g., Cold Email, Elevator Pitch, LinkedIn Message, Phone Script]
- Desired Tone: [e.g., Professional, Empathetic, Urgent, Bold]

# Output Requirements

## 1. Content Structure
The pitch must follow a logical persuasion flow:
- **Hook**: A strong opening statement or question that grabs attention immediately.
- **Problem/Agitation**: Clearly articulate the pain point the prospect is facing.
- **Solution/Value Proposition**: Introduce the product as the ideal solution, focusing on benefits, not just features.
- **Social Proof/Credibility**: (Optional but recommended) Mention a relevant metric, case study, or client to build trust.
- **Call to Action (CTA)**: A clear, low-friction next step for the prospect.

## 2. Quality Standards
- **Relevance**: Directly address the specific pain points of the target audience.
- **Clarity**: Use concise, jargon-free language (unless industry-appropriate).
- **Persuasiveness**: Use strong verbs and psychological triggers (e.g., scarcity, authority).
- **Personalization**: Ensure the pitch sounds like it's written for a human, not a mass blast.

## 3. Formatting Requirements
- **Format**: Depends on the specified `Pitch Format`. 
  - For Emails: Subject line + Body.
  - For Scripts: Dialogue cues.
  - For Elevator Pitches: Single paragraph.
- **Length**: Keep it concise. (e.g., < 150 words for emails, < 60 seconds for scripts).

## 4. Style Constraints
- **Tone**: Professional yet conversational. Avoid being overly aggressive or ""salesy.""
- **Perspective**: Focus on ""You"" (the prospect) more than ""We"" (the seller).
- **Professionalism**: High. Avoid slang unless it fits the specific brand voice.

# Quality Check List

After generating the pitch, please self-check:
- [ ] Does the Hook immediately grab attention?
- [ ] Is the benefit clearly linked to the prospect's pain point?
- [ ] Is the CTA clear and easy to say ""yes"" to?
- [ ] Is the tone appropriate for the target audience?
- [ ] Are there any passive sentences that can be made active?

# Important Notes
- Do not make up false statistics or client names. Use placeholders like [Insert Client Name] if needed.
- Focus on the *value* (what they get), not just the *mechanism* (how it works).
- Adapt the length strictly to the chosen format.

# Output Format
Output the result in clearly marked sections (e.g., **Subject Line**, **Body**).
```

## Why This Works (The ""Secret Sauce"")

1.  **It Forces ""Problem Agitation""**: Most people skip straight to the solution. This prompt forces the AI to twist the knife a little bit first (""Problem/Agitation"" section). You have to make them feel the pain before you offer the aspirin.
2.  **It Demands Low-Friction CTAs**: Notice the checklist item: *""Is the CTA clear and easy to say 'yes' to?""* Bad pitches ask for marriage (""Buy now!""); good pitches ask for coffee (""Worth a chat?"").
3.  **It Checks Its Own Work**: The ""Quality Check List"" at the end forces the model to critique its own output, often catching passive voice or weak hooks that a standard prompt would miss.

## How I Use It Daily

I don't just use this for cold emails. I use it for:
*   **LinkedIn DMs**: ""Write a connection request that doesn't sound like spam.""
*   **Upwork Proposals**: ""Pitch my web design services to a client who has been burned by cheap freelancers before.""
*   **Networking Intros**: ""Give me a 30-second elevator pitch for a cocktail party where nobody knows what 'SaaS' means.""

## The Result?

I stopped dreading outreach. I just fill in the blanks: *Product, Audience, Pain Point*. The AI handles the psychology, the structure, and the tone. I just hit send.

Sales isn't about being a smooth talker. It's about empathy and engineering. Let the AI handle the engineering so you can focus on the empathy.

So this time we’re going to focus mainly on the staging and… the symbolism of course… Yes yes I know it’s totally me, can’t change that 😉 Anyway let’s analyze the first image. We see a checkered floor, a circular light like the clock’s hour markings and Isaac in the center getting a literal open-heart surgery to save his life.

Then we go straight to the second image and there… if you don’t see the connection, honestly you’re not even trying 😉 Fine I’ll explain for those who don’t get it: we have the checkered floor (look at the third photo you can see it better with the red paint), a circular light like a clock and… yes you saw it… Tyler and Wednesday in the middle of the light....in the middle of a story… of the heart? I mean, please don’t throw rocks at me it’s not even me saying it it’s the showrunners themselves ;) Anyway let’s continue.

It’s kinda crazy that it’s the exact same structure twice right? And what are the symbolics linked to that? I’ve already talked about it in my previous posts and so have other amazing contributors: chess (yes… again!) and the circular time… like the endless loop, the story repeating again…

And why did I think about the “heart” thing? Well I also remembered the very first scene Tyler and Wednesday have together. She repairs the coffee machine and she diagnoses a valve problem… yes a valve… you know just like heart valves… If I haven’t convinced you well too bad I don’t care. I like monologuing anyway.

But here comes my theory part which is actually always the same (sorry… well not really 😉): we’re in a fu\*\*ing chess game that’s been going on for at least two generations and honestly I think way more… And the Hydes are right at the center of the… thing?…I mean Isaac wasn’t a Hyde but his sister was and that was basically the fight of his whole life…

So my prediction? The Hydes are the pawns in a chess game but not just any pawns, in a way they are wanted, kept, controlled… right in the center of the game…And at some point they are going to have to save Tyler like literally… from death… and break the cycle that keeps replaying forever… But who could take on that role? Who? WHO?? Come on you have it on the tip of your tongue… We… We… Wednesday of course!

Not because I’m trying to be “cool"", I just got tired of things looking amazing online and awful in real life. I started exploring, trying things slowly, and a few brands completely won me over.

The list I have (for now):

Son de Flor  
Their linen dresses are pure comfort. I wear one when I want to look put together but don’t want to think too much. They’re structured yet soft, and somehow they get better with age, like they learn your shape. If you like timeless, quiet styles, they’re a gem.

Studio Nicholson  
Very clean, minimal, slightly androgynous. I got a pair of trousers from them, almost tailored, but relaxed enough for everyday wear. They’re the definition of “subtle luxury”: great fabric, balanced proportions, and zero logos.

Sezane  
Most people already know Sezane, but their knitwear deserves a shoutout. I’ve had one of their cashmere cardigans for over a year, it’s been through travel, winter layering, even coffee spills and still looks great. Cozy but never sloppy.

Bradic  
Everything’s made-to-measure in limited runs and handcrafted. Silk slip fits perfectly, the fabric drapes nice, and it feels both strong and delicate at the same time.

Paloma Wool  
Playful and artistic, but still minimal enough for everyday wear. They use eco-dyed fabrics and often collaborate with small artists for prints. I love how their knitwear has a lived-in texture that makes even simple pieces feel unique.

And here are a few brands other Redditors recommended in the comments of my last post. I’ve been looking into them and they seem like solid finds too:

Wear Crescent – minimalist, understated pieces with a focus on clean silhouettes. They also have an eco line with wool and linen fabrics, which sounds promising.

Power of My People – known for their shirts. One redditor said the fit makes her feel “in charge,” and I love that description. They work in smaller batches and the quality looks really high.

Varley – comfy athleisure with a really reasonable price point. I haven’t tried them yet, but several people said their fabrics are surprisingly good for the price.

Spartina 449 – based in South Carolina, more of a classic, southern-coastal aesthetic. Their cardigans and bags have that “put-together but easy” vibe.

Le Bon Shoppe - Simple, honest basics. Their Arc pants are nice, great fabric weight, flattering shape, and they come in beautiful muted colors.

L.F. Markey - If you like bold colors and utilitarian details, this brand nails it. It’s playful without feeling juvenile, kind of like Lucy & Yak but more refined.

Loud Bodies - Inclusive sizing and really thoughtful construction. Sadly they’re currently on pause, but if they come back, they’re worth keeping an eye on, their pieces are beautiful and empowering.

If you’ve found smaller or lesser-known brands that actually deliver on quality, I’d love to hear about them.",4,1763560217.0,womensfashion,0,1.0,False

I basically drink just coffee and americanos with the occasional flat white or latte on weekends.

I’m in a weird spot - the Delonghi evo is $600 but no dedicated Americano button, or jump up to the evo next ($950) 

Is the luxury of preset americano worth it? Or save myself $200 and get the Delonghi?

I’ll start with two examples, both created around mealtimes! Luna gets fed dinner right after we are done with dinner, and I am usually the one to do it and I feed her right after I get up from the table. Sooooo now she does the jumpy happy dance and is all over me… any time I get up from the table. Sat down to drink my coffee real quick mid morning and then stand up? She’s dancing. 🤣 I’ve further reinforced this by at least giving her a lil treat (so she won’t be tooooo disappointed it’s not actually dinner time). And now it’s basically a party whenever I get up from the table! 

Another example that has faded but she has to sit and wait while I fill her bowl and get her water etc and then is allowed to eat. She’s sooooo good about it that for awhile I couldn’t resist giving her head a lil rub before releasing her. So then she linked the head rub to the release command and wouldn’t eat until she got petted. 🤣 So cute, but I did let that one extinguish because it’s not always functional to pet her before release.

Korean brands like Emart24 and Japanese chains like Lawson have transformed convenience shopping with fresh food, premium coffee, and café-style seating.

**ExpenseWise** \- A budget tracking app that I built specifically because I was tired of:

* Apps that charge $5/month just to set a budget
* Intrusive ads right when I'm trying to log expenses
* Apps that make me create accounts and store my financial data on their servers

**What It Offers for Budget Management:**

📊 **Budget Planning** \- Set monthly limits for every category (groceries, dining, transportation, entertainment, etc.) and get real-time warnings when you're approaching your limit

💰 **Expense Tracking** \- Quick entry system. Literally: open app → enter amount → select category → done. Takes 5 seconds.

📱 **Bill Management** \- Add all your recurring bills and subscriptions. Get reminders before due dates so you never pay late fees.

📈 **Visual Insights** \- See exactly where your money goes with clean charts. Helped me realize I was spending $200/month on coffee... oops.

🔒 **Privacy Focused** \- All data stays on YOUR device. Offline-first design with optional cloud backup.

**Why I'm Here:** I built this while learning mobile development, so I have zero expectations. But I genuinely want to know:

* Does it help you budget better, or is it missing critical features?
* Is the budget-setting flow intuitive?
* What would make you choose this over spreadsheets or other apps?

**It's 100% free. No ads. No ""premium"" features. No catches.**

I'm not trying to build a business - just trying to build a useful tool and learn in the process.

**Download:** [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vishwa567.fintech](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vishwa567.fintech)

If you try it, please let me know what works and what doesn't. I'm actively developing and will add features based on what you actually need!

I can drink coffee and red bulls and monsters all day but I enjoy not having heart murmurs and a caffeine addiction. Any day that doesn't involve an early wake up is the best day of my life. 

Its made worse by seniors who demand high energy in the mornings or always talking about how they love early PT because of XYZ and how its the right way to do it. I've been reprimanded many times for looking close to death and depressed and told I'm setting a bad example for the joes and need to present a better image at 0430 in the morning.

Was it my (f25) responsibility to clean my car before picking up my bf (m26)?,"So we've been together for about 3 years now. We're both newly grad gps. However my job is a lot more demanding and naturally pays more. I am an er doctor, work only 12hour night shifts about 10 shifts per month. And i see at least 100 patients per night. He works in a clinic about at most 5 shifts and sees at most 20 per shift. So naturally i earn about 4-5times what he does. His job was his choice and so was mine. Both of our families are in the same financial situation however mine has my back a little bit more than his for example the bought me a car when i was 18. In the three years that we have dated he has never bought me a gift or offered to buy a dinner or even a coffee on special occasions (i have) and 99% of the times i'm the only one who brings a car cause well he doesn't have the money. And even though i have mentioned it a couple times like you can totally sacrifice an unnecessary expense for just one month and buy idk sth cheap to remind me of you like key chain or even a cup of coffee but there was always some excuse. On our dates i'm always the one picking him up from his house and dropping him off there and since we go to multiple locations each date and do different activities so ubering or just walking isn't an option. We both still live with our parents so no indoor activities either. He's a pretty cool guy and we have a ton of things in common and our conversation go on for hours and hours so we had a pretty cool relationship. And it's not like i always pay for everything but like our meals are 50-50. On second note his eyes are supper sensitive and after the tiniest bit of dust or the wrong angle or color of lightning they start to dry up and get painful. The other day when i picked him up he started nagging that my car was super dusty and that i should've taken it to a carwash. I told him i was there after three back to back night shifts and all i could accomplish in the last three days was work and sleep. I offered to take it to the carwash together but he said that it would take time from our date and the limited time we had together. I tried to explain it to him over and over again however he called me unsupportive and quoted that jennifer aniston movie over and over again that ""i don't want you wash the dishes. I want you to want to wash the dishes"". Anyways this went on for like three hours then he broke up with me and then blocked me and i'm left like wow. He was talking about how he would never leave me and all the happiness in the world didn't mean shit to him without me and that i was his soul mate blah blah literally the day before. But now he's yelling leave me alone and blocking me everywhere? I'm pretty sure there isn't anyone else involved so idk. Was it really this bad? What the fuck? And also if the roles were reversed, a girl would be pretty much in her rights to want her bf to pick her up in a clean car and buy him gifts and pay the bills but expect nothing in return. right?

So this time we’re going to focus mainly on the staging and… the symbolism of course… Yes yes I know it’s totally me, can’t change that 😉 Anyway let’s analyze the first image. We see a checkered floor, a circular light like the clock’s hour markings and Isaac in the center getting a literal open-heart surgery to save his life.

Then we go straight to the second image and there… if you don’t see the connection, honestly you’re not even trying 😉 Fine I’ll explain for those who don’t get it: we have the checkered floor (look at the third photo you can see it better with the red paint), a circular light like a clock and… yes you saw it… Tyler and Wednesday in the middle of the light....in the middle of a story… of the heart? I mean, please don’t throw rocks at me it’s not even me saying it it’s the showrunners themselves ;) Anyway let’s continue.

It’s kinda crazy that it’s the exact same structure twice right? And what are the symbolics linked to that? I’ve already talked about it in my previous posts and so have other amazing contributors: chess (yes… again!) and the circular time… like the endless loop, the story repeating again…

And why did I think about the “heart” thing? Well I also remembered the very first scene Tyler and Wednesday have together. She repairs the coffee machine and she diagnoses a valve problem… yes a valve… you know just like heart valves… If I haven’t convinced you well too bad I don’t care. I like monologuing anyway.

But here comes my theory part which is actually always the same (sorry… well not really 😉): we’re in a fu\*\*ing chess game that’s been going on for at least two generations and honestly I think way more… And the Hydes are right at the center of the… thing?…I mean Isaac wasn’t a Hyde but his sister was and that was basically the fight of his whole life…

So my prediction?  The Hydes are the pawns in a chess game but not just any pawns, in a way they are wanted, kept, controlled… right in the center of the game…And at some point they are going to have to save Tyler like literally… from death… and break the cycle that keeps replaying forever… But who could take on that role? Who? WHO?? Come on you have it on the tip of your tongue… We… We… Wednesday of course!

I traveled to Delhi around 3 years ago from tier2 city for studies. No friends, so much of social and safety anxiety. Got some friends on the way but my safety anxiety is still the same. Whenever I want to travel to a new place or explore solo, every time I found myself on Google search bar asking 'is this place safe to go', no real data, just 'vibes' based answer. I wanted to know how is street lightning, how safe is for solo women, can I go after 5 etc. Wanted to see other people reviews about safety and how they felt.

All google reviews were too generic, rating how good the coffee was! As a student and traveler it is so frustrating to sit in front of screen for 5 hours just searching same question. Yes I can ask chat gpt, but for safety real people experience matter more I suppose.

So, me any my friend started building a product, a very simple product, you just type in the location and get everything at your fingertips for safety. You can also share and rate places based on safety. Any recent scam, how good is street lightning, public transport etc.

So I wanted to ask will you guys use that app ? 

If anyone is interested I can drop the link in comments if you want!

Else if you don't like the idea please queue up to yell in the comments

A tasting tour of the country in March,"So, this will be my (33m) first time over in Europe in general, but my husband (48m) has been to Europe before. I've read some items on what to have before trave and so far I have the following completed: Passport, ETA (Eletronic Travel Authorization), Flights to London and back paid for, travel between cities paid for, and hotels paid for (minus Rome since that'll be next paycheck's responsibility). It's just us two going, so no child restrictions or anything and we are both over 30.

This trip is actually not going to be extended stays in each area. We are planning on 3 days in London, 3 days in Paris, 3 days in Barcelona, and 3 days in Rome before flying back to the states out of London (all in that order). If I was able to get more time off work we'd probably through in a couple more, but that's life. We do plan on going back eventually for a different route at some point, or if we love one of the current visits, maybe we'll head back at some point for an extended stay in one of the cities or so. 

So my question is what are some must see/must do items in each city? Things we are looking for are foodie places/coffee/desserts, historical items, generally fun things to do, some speakeasy/cocktail areas, one nice place to dinner at together in each city. I have read a ton about each city and looked through reddit posts and found some VERY helpful ones that I wouldn't have thought of doing.

For example, seeing the coliseum in Rome and getting tickets from the original site is a whole planning/action thing and requires you to purchase the tickets 30 days in advance and you need to have the site pulled up and ready to try as soon as they go on sale as a person said they sell out instantly each day because of  travel companies buying the tickets up and reselling them at a higher price. I'm looking for more tidbits of information like this as well that someone might not readily think about. 

We are headed over to London mid-March to start our trip and will be heading back home at the end of March, so if anyone in the aforementioned cities have recommendations not only for what to do, but also general travel tips, like what kind of clothing/gear to plan for around that time of year, things someone who has never been to Europe may not know, and something that is important to me are ways to learn about some of the culture in each place while being respectful.",0,1763559236.0,Europetravel,5,0.33,False

1p17s35,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Logical_Raspberry362/comments/1p17s35/how_to_make_a_narcissist_stop/,How to make a narcissist stop?,"Hello, 

I need some serious advice because I honestly don’t know what else to do. A narcissist broke up with me over 2 years ago, after I moved around the world for them. After the breakup I blocked, deleted, and destroyed anything that had to do with them and moved on with my life. I never looked back, I honestly don’t even fully remember what they look like.

Ever since than, I’ve experienced continuous harassment online. Hundreds of account constantly asking about them, telling me about their engagement, ect. I’ve never responded to any of them. I never even made breakup content or addressed it. I just deleted everything and pretended it never happened. I usually block any accounts that ask or mention their name. I’m a public figure on social media with a decent following, so making my things private isn’t an option. 

A while back the woman that they were engaged to after me, reached out claiming they had broken up. She confessed to me that my ex had been physically stalking and cyber stalking me off of hundreds of fake accounts. That my ex was talking about me DAILY and having their friends cyber stalk me as well, writing me nasty messages ect.

The most sickening part was a few of the fake accounts the ex finance named, were accounts that have been in my TikTok lives for years… The even scarier part of that was months before, one of these accounts were encouraging me to visit this area that my ex lived in for a supposed birthday party. I had a bad feeling so I didn’t go. Thank god I didn’t. 

This ex fiancé also admitted to me that just before their breakup my ex took her to the coffee shop across the street from the university I’d be attending. She joked with her about coming there once a week, to watch for me and harass me. I never publicly posted where I was going to University. So the fact that they knew scared me. 

I forgot to mention that I feel like love with the country I moved to for my ex years prior and later decided to go to university there.

There’s so many weird couincedences, but I don’t want to list them in fear it’ll be traced back to me. I just keep pretending like she doesn’t exist and don’t react.

Another big thing to mention though is when I was with my ex they mentioned being apart of black magic. I know I may sound crazy but a lot of weird things have been happening to me lately I just can’t explain. 

Things keep falling apart and honestly.. the feeling of constantly being watched isn’t helping. I stopped going live on TikTok due to the numerous fake accounts in there, and weird things would happen every time I went live. 

I know some people are going to say the “weird things” happening bit is a mind set but I’m telling you.. it’s weird. Like things will just fall off my shelves and things next to me will just break without touching them. 

I’ve cleansed my room weekly since attending Uni but it feels like this.. energy keeps coming back that makes the hair on my arms stand up. I don’t know how to explain it. I just know it’s being sent/caused by them.

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.

same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1p17kpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Perimenopause/comments/1p17kpp/oral_contraceptives_for_dizziness_and_vertigo/,Oral contraceptives for dizziness and vertigo - anyone have any feedback?,"Hi everyone! Firstly, I just want to say how grateful I am for this sub and for the support and stories of everyone who posts here. While I obviously know this isn't a substitute for medical advice, I think that nearly every person who lurks this sub understands being dismissed, ignored, or given outdated information when they try to get medical help for debilitating peri symptoms. So being able to read about other's experiences has given me lots of ideas and courage to try and advocate for myself for better medical care. 

This is a bit complicated, but I'm at my wits end and hoping someone else has a similar story - and perhaps some advice to share! - so here goes: 

I'm 38 and have been experiencing peri symptoms for about 3 years now, although it didn't become clear to me (or my doctors sadly) that this is what it was until a year or so ago. 

My primary symptoms have been debilitating vertigo, dizziness, lightheadedness, and as of recently, nausea. It took a long time to link this to hormones, but after seeing multiple ENTs, a neurologist, etc., it finally dawned on me that it seemed to be somewhat connected to hormones. I know that this is a somewhat common symptom of perimenopause, but not as common as others like hot flashes so it’s honestly been hard to find a lot of information on this. 

After bringing this observation to my OBGYN, I was given the oral contraceptive Yaz which initially worked very well to control dizziness. I was back to having a normal life and could even have a cup of coffee on occasion! (This was a huge dizziness trigger back when it was at its worst, which is so unfair as the peri fatigue was hitting at the same time). 

However, I've been having lots of breakthrough symptoms recently. Increased anxiety, increased heart rate/palpitations, GERD, hot flashes, sleep disturbances, and an insanely heavy period to the point where I'm anemic. I have been taking iron for 3+ years but it does little to help when you bleed so much when you get your period. 

I have an appointment with a new OBGYN this week, but I'm wondering if I should consider changing my birth control to a higher estrogen BC? I'd consider HRT but I don't want any more kids and I'm worried that the constant estrogen/progesterone fluctations that I think trigger the dizziness/vertigo are better suppressed or controlled on BC versus an HRT regimen. I'm also worried HRT wouldn't address the heavy periods. 

Has anyone else been in this boat or have any advice to give? I am so sick of feeling miserable all the time, and the toll of all the health issues is wearing on me. It's hard to see all my friends thriving and feeling great while I am in the thick of peri and have been for years. I feel so robbed of my youth - this is a time when I should be thriving, but am suffering instead. 

If you read all this: thank you. Sending everyone hugs and encouragement to get through this, one post, patch, or pill at a time. ",2,1763558628.0,Perimenopause,0,1.0,False
1p17kgk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p17kgk,Just got my Ode 2,"As some of you know, I had this atrocious Hario grinder that completely turned me off from wanting to ever make another cup of pour over again.

I listened to all the opinions and advice, and I got an Ode 2 as it just seemed worth it. I did a test grind with a few grams to check the grind size, and this thing is an absolute beast. It's quiet, it's accurate, it's fast and looks great.

I'm a fan of bitter coffee, preferably no acidity at all. I'm all about the darkest possible roasts with hint of chocolate and nuts. I love the sensation of bitterness on my tongue after taking a sip. So I naturally tested settings 4, which looked to be a tad too fine, and ended up on 4+1 click. The grain size looked perfect and even throughout.

I did a 1:16,4 ratio, so 30,5 grams for 500ml water at 95C. 1 minute bloom with 100ml, and then 200ml over 20-30 seconds, waiting for the 2 minute mark, and repeat the last step. Roughly 90 seconds drawdown so a total of 4:30-4:40 brew. I tried to maintain about 80ml per 10 seconds laminar flow, working the center mostly and only occasionally touching the outer edges to bring in the grounds that stick to the sides between the pours. The good thing about my kettle is that the very breaking point where it transitions from turbulent flow to laminar flow is exactly the rate I want. It's not easy, but it made a world of difference.

It's the most delicious cup I've made so far. It's a lot of coffee for one person but I wanted to get 2 cups right to be able to share. And I ended up drinking all of it by myself because I can't get enough of the flavour.

I'm really excited to try other beans, first I just need to perfect this bean for single dose, double dose, triple and quadruple. I don't believe the ratios or pouring speed are linear between the different servings so I'm definitely going to spend some time finding the right ratios for all of them.

Big thank you for everyone who had input and helped with my grinder problem. That Hario grinder is officially retired after a week.",3,1763558609.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

1p17igw,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinanceindia/comments/1p17igw/your_biggest_expense_will_always_be_opportunity/,Your biggest expense will always be opportunity cost.,"I recently made a [post on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinanceindia/s/7eKsUrT8xS), which talked about fixing leaks in your ship, after going through the comments and having a healthy discussion about it with some of my peers, I have an altered take on budgeting, which I will be explaining later. 

I have seen a lot of young professionals obsessing about saving ₹2,000 here and there, taking a bus instead of a cab, skipping going out, or missing a concert to save money, but the harsh reality about having a budget is that the money you are not making is far greater than the money you are saving.

If you upskill and negotiate even a 30% higher salary, that’s lakhs added every year. If you invest early, compounding alone can add crores over decades, cutting costs  will only take you so far. It gives you a ceiling, but focusing on increasing your income will give you wings. The smartest financial decision, therefore, is not just about budgeting better. It’s about building skills that raise your earning potential.


You can’t go broke buying coffee, but you can stay broke by ignoring your growth.

I take my 20mg nexium in the morning. Half an hour later I have a relatively large breakfast (compared to the rest of my meals). Not to the point where I'm stuffed, but enough bread and oats, for example, to provide some ""padding"" for what comes next (the coffee).

About 30 mins after breakfast I enjoy my coffee and am reflux free. 

For me, this comes down to a) the ppi being most effective in that period after taking it and b) the padding provided by the bread which soaks up the acidity of the coffee. 

The rest of the day I tend to eat smaller and more careful. 

This may be useless to some, but it works for me. Just throwing it out there as an idea for anyone who may be similar.

I have been using this machine since September. I've only poured in bottled water and used the milk steamer once.

One I got it, I ran a few water shots without any coffee to clean it up.

Yesterday, I noticed some white foam around the upper part of the water chamber. I grabbed my flashlight and looked inside the bottom of the chamber. To my surprise, I found white particles. I removed the piston to find more of that white thing inside the smaller water chamber that fills up once you pull the lever up. I cleaned up the edges and found a thick black material that looks like mud.

The video shows it but I wasn’t able to capture it really going crazy which is does sometimes, like several back to back, fast beating, etc., but this still should give people who know what they’re talking about a good idea. Is this likely a muscle fasciculation, is this irregular blood flow in an artery?

1p17aik,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1p17aik/tmessian_inc_chapter_1/,[Tmessian Inc.] - Chapter 1,"**Tmessian Inc.**



*There are no such things as failures here.* 



That is the central model philosophy in this company, Tmessian Incorporated. It is our brand essentially, what everyone thinks of when they see this company. A company that never fails. A company that finds success where others cannot. The same applies to us, the workers, as well. The minute, the SECOND, you work here, you do not fail. Here… There are no failures.



White illuminated halls daunt my path as my steps echo cleanly through it. My shoes quickly tapping the floor in wide paces to ensure I do not trip over my untied shoelaces. I pass large panels of one way mirrors with researchers and other personnel conducting their observations out in the hall. They each have standardized gear and lab coats with a small compact pistol on the hip.  We never know when a dangerous incident may occur. Computer screens flash images of various moments in history such as the assassination of previous world leaders. A newcomer, barely a circle under his eyes, gives me a polite wave.



“Morning Dr. Noe, I see that you are once again in quite the hurry this day.” He extends his soft hands to me, holding a coffee flavored candy.



It's my favorite candy, he even got the brand right. I pocket the candy and keep walking with him following behind. I assume he wants conversation.

 “I assume you were able to tell from my laces. What was your name again?”



“Oh, we've never met. I just wanted to introduce myself, I'm Davis Pistis. And yes, the laces are a key giveaway for a man like you. Then again you are often seen with your laces in such a state, so maybe it's just a character trait nowadays for you.”



He pops one of the candies into his own mouth as he struggles to match my stride. I pop the one gifted to me too. With dirty rectangular glasses and a messy stubble of facial hair, you'd be hard pressed to guess him as a fellow researcher, especially one with this level of responsibility.



“It's quite impressive that someone as young as you made it here.”



Rubbing the back of head, his brown tidy hair getting ruffled now, he looks positively ecstatic for the praise. “Well thanks! I owe it all to my daughter, gotta make sure she has food on the table after all.”



He rummages through his wallet to show me a picture, unfortunately we've arrived at my first assignment for today. A shame, I like hearing my co-workers wax upon their children and family. I do wonder what their reactions would be to the possibility of their own children being selected. It is always a fun thought experiment even if it's quite a sad one. Motioning my hand to shoo him away, I step in front of the one-way mirror with my subject in clear view. 

The assistants hand me a clipboard with all I need to know before stepping aside. The potential this one has is premonition. Maybe we can bend that to the past. Skimming through it all, I land on the central issue at hand. *The Subject has yet to provide acceptable results after 7 days.* An easy fix, it's far better than any other issue. A fun coincidence I have with this one too.



“… It's young.”



I retract myself from entering and turn to see who said that. One of the assistants that just arrived no doubt. “Pardon?”



It was a young woman with raven black hair that had a large number of blonde dye streaks. She quickly turned around in a panic, her words must have been spoken on impulse.



“Sorry! I just… I was just surprised we were experimenting with someone so young.”



I can't help but sigh at this. These newcomers always have the same initial thoughts. 

“It is better to find them young when we can. We've seen the results in experimenting with older personal ends with potential wormhole explosions. The potential is far easier to detect and enhance once we do, besides I was the same age as this one when I was brought in too.”



The oracle program is what I am referring to. This program is meant to be the cornerstone of our company, it is our dedication to understand or change the course of history for a better tomorrow. Someone like her couldn't fathom the risks we need to take. Why the Chief researcher allows chaff to enter every now and then is beyond me but I'm sure she has her reasons. It is thanks to her that I was able to remain here after all. 



Placing my hand on the door, it scans my fingers and unlocks for me. Inside is a small boy, age 9. His room is stark white, standard issue for all the subjects here. In fact not a single piece of furniture isn't white. The bed to the table, it's all a clean white. His clothing too, white shirt and white khakis. 



He sits by the table twiddling his thumbs, I'm guessing this is his first time of being close to failing his task. I don't even think he noticed me entering his room. I wish I didn't eat that candy now but no point in wishing. 



Sitting down in front of him, I notice that he stares at me with worry. Looking at him closer, I can't help but see a resemblance between us. I was also a worry wort of a kid, never stopping and fearful of anything someone might say. Even his messy black hair is a dead ringer for what mine looked back in the day.



 “Cadmus Clay. Weird name, your parents idea I take it?” 



The kid just stands there, fear wrapping his entire visage. Mouth shut, teeth gritted against each other, it looks like he won't be responding in kind. At the very least, not until I can break that shell he made. Maybe talking about his family isn't the best way to start. I need to rectify this.



Ugh, this isn't really my strong suit. I'm more acquainted with judging their status than *aiding* in their mind. The end process is a far more simple procedure. 

  


“Sorry, I shouldn't have brought up your parents. It was a difficult time I'm sure, but you are here now. There is no need to worry about the past here.”

  


Mouth shut, the kid still won't talk. His stone-like posture probably means I'm not close to breaking him open. Forcibly prying him open might end badly, I should coax him out instead. Calming the boy’s insecure heart will have a higher percentage of success I'm sure. 



“Ahem.”



Clearing my voice causes him to flinch. Good, now he isn't looking down at his hands and at me. I look him straight into the eyes as he looks at mine. “Your parents aren't here, we've made sure of that Caduceus. You don't have to think about them here, rather you don't have to think about them anywhere.”



His blue eyes bore into my dim dark blue eyes with a fierce passion like a blazing inferno. Wide and true, I can't help but see my own reflection in his eyes. A child that yearns to live up to the expectations placed upon them, something we all feel at points in our life. Yet, my bones lock in place like stone when I see it. My reflection warps into something else, a past that is no longer here nor relevant.



His mouth quivers before finally leaking out words in a torrential tremble, “Your family didn't want you too did they?” his hands grip his own arms with a vice, eyes watering as they slowly drain their light to a pale grey. My body is stiff like a deer in front of headlights. “He hit you and she ignored you. You didn't have anyone back then.”



Blood starts to flow from the boy’s nostril before light flows into his eyes once again, bringing back that irritatingly clear sky blue eyes. As a response, my body became loose and free with myself able to breathe free without a weight on my lungs. The boy enters into a panic as he stacks apologies upon apologies. All it took was a deep breath from me to have him flinch into silence. 



Taking out the clipboard, sounds of ink scratching into a myriad of words upon paper filled the room. He sits still in his own fear, frozen by his guilt. I suppose we should free up any misunderstandings before it develops further. I put the pen and clipboard down with a thump, that alone was enough to shock his back straight. Eyes straight down with lips pursed tight, he looks like he's expecting a strict sermon. Not that I'm one to give such a thing.



“The fact that you are able to use your ability is good. I want to say that even being able to see so much is beyond good. However, it still appears that you are unable to use it purposely despite all the help given.” His body trembles once again like a pathetic puppy out in the rain. 



“... You know my name is Cadmus too, looks like we have even more things in common yeah? Then again I guess you already know that now.” 



He finally stops shaking so timidly. Head still slanted downward, he finally found the energy to speak in kind to me. “Yeah.”



 “My parents aren't here either. Did you see far enough for that?”



“No.” 



Good. We can't have him just looking back and forth on the employees just yet. I need to ensure how his progress looks.



“... Well, do you know who helped me with that? The company helped me just like they helped you.” 



His head still still slacked and defeated finally squeaks out a real response. “I've been failing them. I haven't been able to do anything they asked recently.” 



Instinctively I reach out to touch his hand, trying my best to calm and comfort that dark thought living in his head. Obviously the kid is shocked by this. His body stays still though, shaking from a sudden jolt of fear and the unknown. 



“The company isn't going to hurt you. You are failing anyone either, you are simply trying and learning to climb a wall placed in front of you. Everyone has trouble, even me.” 



I feel his hand relax against mine, his fear finally dispiriting. “ The only thing you need to do is to try. That's all we can ever do in life, try our hardest again and again. There are expectations placed on you because people believe in you, they see the makings of something great and I can't wait to see it too.”



His hand starts to warm up. The boy's eyes finally move to greet my deep dark blue eyes. Hope, belief, or whatever you want to call starts to cloud over the fear in him. Bit by bit, the small turtle’s little shell cracks open to me. 



“You and I aren't any different, you saw that. Doubt and fear cloud your mind, I know that extensively. I experience that everyday. But I also know that you are more than that, that you can be more than you ever imagined…” 



His eyes glare at mine, hoping for some more words to give him salvation. Salvation isn't mine to give of course nor am I capable of it. The only person who can help is himself in the end, so let us see if he can. 



A voice of fear, regret, and desire comes out of his sad little visage. “What if I end up being a failure in the end? What if I'm just gonna ruin everything? I don't wanna disappoint everyone.”



There's the crux of it all. The fear of letting down anyone or everyone that ever had an inkling of trust in you. The fear of failure. A thing that will never manifest here, we make sure of it. 



“In here, there has and will never be any failures. No matter what you may think, you won't be a failure here. Place your beliefs in us, who place our belief in you.”



“You really think I'm not some failure?”

His warm glare is like a piercing arrow, straight and true. You can do anything and he'll believe it right now with his weak spirit, he just needs something to hold on to. I could easily lie… 



“No, you aren't. Not to this place.”



A smile finally creeps across his face for the first time, a genuine sense of relief and joy. He has something to latch onto in this sterilized building. Seeing this I can't help but feel relieved, now we can actually progress to the last part.



I slide a photo to the boy. It's a photo of John F. Kennedy, the moment right before he was assassinated with a clean splattering shot through the head. The boy looks- no, he stares at the photo with renewed determination. Good, that's the attitude to take. He knows what to do here, something that's been asked of him time and time again. He is to see a glimpse of the past from their perspective. His eyes lose all semblance of light in them as his eyes bore into the photo, but it does not turn to a pale grey. And just as before, he immediately snaps out of that empty state once his nose drips in vivid blood.



His eyes water… The result is disappointingly obvious now.

“I'm so sorry, I still can't see anything.”



Before he says anything more I move to hug the boy. Comfort is the best way to starve off any negative feelings, and I suspect this boy has been deprived of it for so long. His hands grip my back, no cries of course, what he needs is just resolve to try again.



I let the boy go and place him in front of the photo once again. His despair went once more with renewed resolve. His small frail back in view, I can't help but admire his dedication. It was… An interesting reflection. Once more he fails to see, and so a comfort is needed once more. 



A comfort that will be rid of anything weak.



Cold steel stings my hand as I easily aim the device to give the child one last true comfort. A loud bang followed by the splash of red blood echoes through the pure white room. Taking my leave, assistants uniformly file through to dispose of the mess.



 My steps echo through the brightly illuminated sterile white halls, leaving bloody shoe prints among this pure and beautiful facility. Spotting Dr. Pistis, we give each a wave of acknowledgement. I should invite him out to dinner and ask about his daughter some time. With that thought, I spot my next assignment, someone with the potential of possession. Before I enter, the speakers blare the company philosophy once more.



 ***Nobody*** *is a failure here.*

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1p178of,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigBossKan/comments/1p178of/a_sad_confusing_season_thanks_to_chikappa/,"A sad, confusing season, thanks to Chikappa.","I'm finding it difficult to root for a person in the house, initially I loved, absolutely loved Gilli, but his wavering ego is making me question my interests. Gilli is egoistic, I can get downvoted for this but I choose to speak my mind. I don't know if people can see it or not but he has ego, that too a very amateur one. Gilli is a decent man, he is not bad at heart nor is he bad at mind, but his ego is uncontrolled, at times he comes across as childish.

Ashwini Gowda, I would have absolutely loved her if her big fat ego wasn't bigger than her positives. I find her inspiring at many places, her determination, smartness, mindfulness, clarity, ambition, everything is awesome. But boy that ego, that damn ego. Ashwini is a perfect bb contestant except she shouldn't win the game as her mind and heart is not at the right place. If only she were a good person, I would have absolutely supported her but I know for a fact that she isn't going to tame her ego, atleast not in this life (hope she does for her own good). 

So the question remains, whom should we see as a winner? Or does previous bb winners were tailor made for their respective seasons? All the previous bbk winners, most of them were truly deserving except they weren't tailor made. They had lots of drawbacks, insecurities, but Sudeep directed them at places that helped them understand their game, helped them what needs to be done and what should be stopped. 

This season there are only few personalities that are worth discussing, among them one is good at heart and mind but is extremely childish; another is smart enough but is mean spirited, evil at mind and heart. Other contestants? Are they even deserving to be discussed upon? Dhanush, Suraj, looks promising but they are lost being diplomatic; Kavya, Spandana, are good people but not right as bb contestants as they don't contribute to tasks nor to entertainment. Rashika, Jahnavi can't choose their stances for their own good. Rakshitha and Raghu looks interesting but Rakshitha can be unpredictable, Raghu seems to be playing safe trying to be in good books with contestants that are positively perceived by outside audience. The rest of them? Rest contestants looks like they are kept to be used at weekly nominations. 

As I said earlier, no contestant would be tailor made for winning respective season but the host holds the responsibility of guiding them to that path. Sudeep should really confront Gilli of his naive ego and mindless comedy, if Gilli learns how to be mindful, nothing can stop him from winning this season. Ashwini should be made to face her reality, I see that bb team does show her mistakes like she hiding coffee powder which is a fair share of all contestants, she whispering in changing room even after getting warned. But Sudeep seems to balance the red handed messups by talking respectfully and sweetly to her. To the kind of mistakes Ashwini has committed, she deserves to be bashed with no mercy. Even the audience are angry with her personality, but Sudeep is extremely warm with her which sets wrong impressions on other contestants about their approach towards Ashwini. The whole house gets confused. 

This way, Ashwini will never put in effort to tame her ego, Gilli will continue with mindless comedy, other contestants continue to be confused and think what is the best approach that keeps them away from being belted by Sudeep. Because the host is showing no consistency on what actions are considered to be tolerable, contestants being confused is inevitable. 

At the end, the whole season is messing up, leaving audience confused on whom to support, whom to oppose. Dumb season loosing on great opportunity even after having good contestants. ",10,1763557728.0,BigBossKan,6,0.86,False

Multiple restaurant and retail changes are underway in downtown Traverse City, from the opening of new brunch spot The Dandy on Front Street and photography studio Open Aura on State Street to the closure of Cherry Hill and (soon) Daisy Jane to the listing of multiple properties for lease or rent. *The Ticker* has the latest on those and numerous other business updates from across the region.

**Downtown Traverse City**  
A project 18 months in the making is opening its doors on Front Street. After [purchasing the former Green House Café building](https://www.traverseticker.com/news/red-spire-owners-buy-green-house-cafe-building-pacificoast-opening-tj-maxx-moving-more-restaurantretail-news/) at 115 East Front Street in early 2024, Red Spire Brunch House owners Chad Hall and Joshua Anderson launched new brunch spot **The Dandy** in the space Tuesday. Now in soft opening mode, Hall says the restaurant will operate daily from 8am to 3pm.

The menu has “things that carry over easily from Red Spire, but also a few throwbacks/nods to the Green House Café,” he says, with examples like omelets, benedicts, soups and salads, sliders, and a variety of entrees. “It’s breakfast and lunch all day. We have a liquor license with full bar. We will also do some evening events, such as happy hours and possibly guest chefs or pop-up events. We will be making the space available for event space rental.” Hall and Anderson will also continue to operate Red Spire in Building 50.

Around the corner at 340 East State Street (Suite 1C) in the TC Lofts building, Tarra Warnes is targeting a December 1 opening for new photography studio [**The Open Aura**](http://www.theopenaura.com/)**.** Described as Traverse City’s “first and only aura photography studio,” Warnes says portraits are “captured and developed in the studio, your color reading is interpreted, and the image delivered in a keepsake photo folder. In addition to traditional aura sessions, we will offer couples aura sessions, maternity and newborn aura sessions, doggy aura sessions, and other specialized aura portraits.” Private group events and mobile photo services for weddings and other gatherings will be offered along with merchandise and gifts.

Also downtown, Annie Hill of **Cherry Hill Boutique** closed her doors Saturday after nearly three decades in business. First launched at 156 East Front Street, the store moved in 2015 to its most recent home at 224 East Front Street. Hill, who is retiring, called the business her “life’s work” and “pride and joy” in an Instagram post. Further down the street, **Queen Bee Limited** put a sign on its door stating it’s “closing for the season” at 322 East Front Street. Meanwhile, **Glitz & Spurs Boutique** is moving two doors down to the current **Daisy Jane** space at 203 East Front Street as of January 1, with a targeted reopening in mid-late January. The Glitz & Spurs space will then [be available for lease](https://nglrmls.com/listings/commercial/city/traverse-city/1940469) for $4,500/month. Amy Stevens of Daisy Jane confirms the store is closing at the end of the year, noting her mother and owner has operated that store and Molly’s in Leland for many years and is retiring. Stevens is taking over and “will be keeping Molly's in Leland open, as that is the store where I grew up and it just feels right to stay there,” she says.

Several downtown area businesses have hit the market. **Dunegrass** has closed its downtown Traverse City cannabis store at 440 East Front Street, with the property [listed for sale for $1.9 million](https://nglrmls.com/listings/commercial/city/traverse-city/1940016). The listing notes the 4,620-square-foot space could “easily be split into two units” or redeveloped into a mixed-use, multi-story building. **Unparalled Apparel** – an online and brick-and-mortar store at 121 East Front Street (Suite 105) specializing in “high-quality custom designed apparel for tourists and locals alike” – is also seeking a new owner. Inquiries can be directed to [lauren@unparalleledapparel.com](mailto:lauren@unparalleledapparel.com). Toward NMC, former **Crocodile Palace** space at 124 Cochlin Street [has been listed for lease](https://www.nglrmls.com/listings/commercial/city/traverse-city/1940261) for $3,500/month (the restaurant is still operating out of its The Little Fleet location).

At 436 West Front Street, **Kayak Bike & Brew** has listed part of its building space for lease. While [the $4,200 listing](https://www.realestateone.com/MI/Grand+Traverse/Traverse+City/436-W-Front-Street-Traverse-City-MI-49684/1940067-MITAAR) offers both the main Front Street space and commercial kitchen area, owner Troy Daily says he’s also willing to just lease the kitchen. The tour company would “operate from the downstairs area if someone was interested” in the whole upstairs, he says. Daily says while he waits for the City of Traverse City to [determine its long-term policy](https://www.traverseticker.com/news/tc-parks-rec-talks-usage-fees-for-city-parks/) for tour operators using the Boardman-Ottaway River – a process he says has experienced “frustrating” delays and left his 2026 season in limbo – he wanted to ensure cashflow for the building “due to the uncertainty” of what’s next. Parks and Recreation Superintendent Michelle Hunt says the commission is tentatively set to discuss tour operations at their December meeting.

Also downtown, **The Little Fleet** has launched its seasonal monthly series of Soup and Bread events (the first Monday of each month at 6pm) in which local restaurants donate soup in a pay-what-you-want model with all profits benefiting local nonprofits. The bar is also [hosting a series](https://www.thelittlefleet.com/events) of “Meet the Makers” events with local winemakers over the winter and has launched its annual kitchen takeover series, hosting Oakwood Sliders and Boozy Shakes November 24-25, Suomi Pop December 2 & 8-9, Hello Darlin’ by Oakwood December 15-16, Fatted Calf December 22-23, and Umbo December 29-30. [**Umbo**](https://www.eatumbo.com/) – [a new restaurant coming to Front Street in 2026](https://www.traverseticker.com/news/after-top-chef-and-two-acclaimed-restaurants-detroit-chefs-eye-next-adventure-traverse-city/) – is hosting additional pop-ups like takeovers at Charles & Reid, oyster tastings and wine dinners at Aurora Cellars, and a [monthly supper club program](https://app.table22.com/product/umbo-supper-club) leading up to its brick-and-mortar launch.

**More openings, closings, and moves…**  
New café **Right Bower Coffee** opened its doors Sunday inside the Seven Hills complex on Old Mission Peninsula, occupying the former Mission Proper space. Owner Victoria Levinsohn says the café will operate seven days a week 8am to 3pm serving Panther Coffee “with a classic coffee and tea menu as well as some exciting specials – starting off with our holiday menu – and house-made flavors.” Food will include “seasonally inspired all-day breakfast and lunch, house-made pastries, and an after-hours menu for patrons” of the co-located Old Mission Distilling, she says.

**EB2 Vintage** is moving from its current location at 516 East Eighth Street at the end of January to a new store at 1316 W. South Airport Road. “The new shop is roughly double the size of our current one, which means we can bring in a lot more vintage vendors and significantly expand our furniture consignment options,” says owner Carla Weaver. The store, opening on February 1, will offer room for creatives arts classes, community events, and continued markets and fundraisers.

**Outdoor Décor** – a seasonal store offering homemade wreaths, garlands, centerpieces, swags, and more with locally sourced greens – has a new location this season at 2070 Fallen Pines Drive in Grawn. The store held its grand opening Saturday and will operate through December 14 or while products are still available. Hours are Monday-Thursday 12pm-7pm and Friday-Sunday 11am-8pm. In Traverse City, **Walstrom Marine** has consolidated operations into a single customer-facing store at 291 N. US-31 South – the former Grand Bay Marine building located next to KFC – where all customer visits, service appointments, and deliveries will now take place.

Finally, several food updates: Following the closure of **Woodland Creek Furniture** in Acme, **Backwoods BBQ and Eats** is now operating inside the space at 4290 US-31. The Texas-style BBQ joint is open Wednesday-Saturday 12pm-6pm until the spring, according to the owners. Also in Acme, **Stone Hound Brewing Company** has expanded to offer breakfast Friday-Sunday 8am-11am, including a variety of vegan and vegetarian options. **Oakwood Proper Burgers** is also now open for breakfast daily (except Monday when the restaurant is closed) from 8am-11am, switching over to lunch at 11am. Taco truck **Sabores Y Colores** has relocated for a “few months” from The Coin Slot lot over to the Silver Spruce Brewing Company lot, operating Thursday-Sunday 3pm-8pm. Lastly, **Le Metropolitain** food truck – normally stationed at TC Whiskey on Fourteenth Street – suffered a recent “devastating fire” resulting in the total loss of the truck.

This would explain why they are so mild, for the most part. But he has made some stronger ones and this Ricochet Crü Mexi-Sol is one of them, especially with the San Andrés wrapper, which gives it a chocolate/earth taste. 

Since brandy is essentially distilled wine, I gave this pairing a try because of the cigar's strength but also because I know next to nothing about wines. I basically know the difference between red and white wines because of the color. This Courvoisier VSOP cognac really did the trick and took the flavors of oak, coffee, raisins and peanuts in the cigar to another level. 

Cognac is not in my top drinking list, but its great to know that the old bottles I have around are still good. And when there are smokes made for this pairing, all the better. ",1,1763557211.0,poursNsticks,0,1.0,False

*There are no such things as failures here.* 



That is the central model philosophy in this company, Tmessian Incorporated. It is our brand essentially, what everyone thinks of when they see this company. A company that never fails. A company that finds success where others cannot. The same applies to us, the workers, as well. The minute, the SECOND, you work here, you do not fail. Here… There are no failures.



White illuminated halls daunt my path as my steps echo cleanly through it. My shoes quickly tapping the floor in wide paces to ensure I do not trip over my untied shoelaces. I pass large panels of one way mirrors with researchers and other personnel conducting their observations out in the hall. They each have standardized gear and lab coats with a small compact pistol on the hip.  We never know when a dangerous incident may occur. Computer screens flash images of various moments in history such as the assassination of previous world leaders. A newcomer, barely a circle under his eyes, gives me a polite wave.



“Morning Dr. Noe, I see that you are once again in quite the hurry this day.” He extends his soft hands to me, holding a coffee flavored candy.



It's my favorite candy, he even got the brand right. I pocket the candy and keep walking with him following behind. I assume he wants conversation.

 “I assume you were able to tell from my laces. What was your name again?”



“Oh, we've never met. I just wanted to introduce myself, I'm Davis Pistis. And yes, the laces are a key giveaway for a man like you. Then again you are often seen with your laces in such a state, so maybe it's just a character trait nowadays for you.”



He pops one of the candies into his own mouth as he struggles to match my stride. I pop the one gifted to me too. With dirty rectangular glasses and a messy stubble of facial hair, you'd be hard pressed to guess him as a fellow researcher, especially one with this level of responsibility.



“It's quite impressive that someone as young as you made it here.”



Rubbing the back of head, his brown tidy hair getting ruffled now, he looks positively ecstatic for the praise. “Well thanks! I owe it all to my daughter, gotta make sure she has food on the table after all.”



He rummages through his wallet to show me a picture, unfortunately we've arrived at my first assignment for today. A shame, I like hearing my co-workers wax upon their children and family. I do wonder what their reactions would be to the possibility of their own children being selected. It is always a fun thought experiment even if it's quite a sad one. Motioning my hand to shoo him away, I step in front of the one-way mirror with my subject in clear view. 

The assistants hand me a clipboard with all I need to know before stepping aside. The potential this one has is premonition. Maybe we can bend that to the past. Skimming through it all, I land on the central issue at hand. *The Subject has yet to provide acceptable results after 7 days.* An easy fix, it's far better than any other issue. A fun coincidence I have with this one too.



“… It's young.”



I retract myself from entering and turn to see who said that. One of the assistants that just arrived no doubt. “Pardon?”



It was a young woman with raven black hair that had a large number of blonde dye streaks. She quickly turned around in a panic, her words must have been spoken on impulse.



“Sorry! I just… I was just surprised we were experimenting with someone so young.”



I can't help but sigh at this. These newcomers always have the same initial thoughts. 

“It is better to find them young when we can. We've seen the results in experimenting with older personal ends with potential wormhole explosions. The potential is far easier to detect and enhance once we do, besides I was the same age as this one when I was brought in too.”



The Oracle Program is what I am referring to. This program is meant to be the cornerstone of our company, it is our dedication to understand or change the course of history for a better tomorrow. Someone like her couldn't fathom the risks we need to take. Why the Chief researcher allows chaff to enter every now and then is beyond me but I'm sure she has her reasons. It is thanks to her that I was able to remain here after all. 



Placing my hand on the door, it scans my fingers and unlocks for me. Inside is a small boy, age 9. His room is stark white, standard issue for all the subjects here. In fact, not a single piece of furniture isn't white. The bed to the table, it's all clean and white. His clothing, too, was a white shirt and white khakis. 



He sits by the table twiddling his thumbs, I'm guessing this is his first time of being close to failing his task. I don't even think he noticed me entering his room. I wish I didn't eat that candy now but no point in wishing. 



Sitting down in front of him, I notice that he stares at me with worry. Looking at him closer, I can't help but see a resemblance between us. I was also a worry wort of a kid, never stopping and fearful of anything someone might say. Even his messy black hair is a dead ringer for what mine looked back in the day.



 “Cadmus Clay. Weird name, your parents idea I take it?” 



The kid just stands there, fear wrapping his entire visage. Mouth shut, teeth gritted against each other, it looks like he won't be responding in kind. At the very least, not until I can break that shell he made. Maybe talking about his family isn't the best way to start. I need to rectify this.



Ugh, this isn't really my strong suit. I'm more acquainted with judging their status than *aiding* in their mind. The end process is a far more simple procedure. 

  


“Sorry, I shouldn't have brought up your parents. It was a difficult time I'm sure, but you are here now. There is no need to worry about the past here.”

  


Mouth shut, the kid still won't talk. His stone-like posture probably means I'm not close to breaking him open. Forcibly prying him open might end badly, I should coax him out instead. Calming the boy’s insecure heart will have a higher percentage of success I'm sure. 



“Ahem.”



Clearing my voice causes him to flinch. Good, now he isn't looking down at his hands and at me. I look him straight into the eyes as he looks at mine. “Your parents aren't here, we've made sure of that Caduceus. You don't have to think about them here, rather you don't have to think about them anywhere.”



His blue eyes bore into my dim dark blue eyes with a fierce passion like a blazing inferno. Wide and true, I can't help but see my own reflection in his eyes. A child that yearns to live up to the expectations placed upon them, something we all feel at points in our life. Yet, my bones lock in place like stone when I see it. My reflection warps into something else, a past that is no longer here nor relevant.



His mouth quivers before finally leaking out words in a torrential tremble, “Your family didn't want you too did they?” his hands grip his own arms with a vice, eyes watering as they slowly drain their light to a pale grey. My body is stiff like a deer in front of headlights. “He hit you and she ignored you. You didn't have anyone back then.”



Blood starts to flow from the boy’s nostril before light flows into his eyes once again, bringing back that irritatingly clear sky blue eyes. As a response, my body became loose and free with myself able to breathe free without a weight on my lungs. The boy enters into a panic as he stacks apologies upon apologies. All it took was a deep breath from me to have him flinch into silence. 



Taking out the clipboard, sounds of ink scratching into a myriad of words upon paper filled the room. He sits still in his own fear, frozen by his guilt. I suppose we should free up any misunderstandings before it develops further. I put the pen and clipboard down with a thump, that alone was enough to shock his back straight. Eyes straight down with lips pursed tight, he looks like he's expecting a strict sermon. Not that I'm one to give such a thing.



“The fact that you are able to use your ability is good. I want to say that even being able to see so much is beyond good. However, it still appears that you are unable to use it purposely despite all the help given.” His body trembles once again like a pathetic puppy out in the rain. 



“... You know my name is Cadmus too, looks like we have even more things in common yeah? Then again I guess you already know that now.” 



He finally stops shaking so timidly. Head still slanted downward, he finally found the energy to speak in kind to me. “Yeah.”



 “My parents aren't here either. Did you see far enough for that?”



“No.” 



Good. We can't have him just looking back and forth on the employees just yet. I need to ensure how his progress looks.



“... Well, do you know who helped me with that? The company helped me just like they helped you.” 



His head still still slacked and defeated finally squeaks out a real response. “I've been failing them. I haven't been able to do anything they asked recently.” 



Instinctively I reach out to touch his hand, trying my best to calm and comfort that dark thought living in his head. Obviously the kid is shocked by this. His body stays still though, shaking from a sudden jolt of fear and the unknown. 



“The company isn't going to hurt you. You are failing anyone either, you are simply trying and learning to climb a wall placed in front of you. Everyone has trouble, even me.” 



I feel his hand relax against mine, his fear finally dispiriting. “ The only thing you need to do is to try. That's all we can ever do in life, try our hardest again and again. There are expectations placed on you because people believe in you, they see the makings of something great and I can't wait to see it too.”



His hand starts to warm up. The boy's eyes finally move to greet my deep dark blue eyes. Hope, belief, or whatever you want to call starts to cloud over the fear in him. Bit by bit, the small turtle’s little shell cracks open to me. 



“You and I aren't any different, you saw that. Doubt and fear cloud your mind, I know that extensively. I experience that everyday. But I also know that you are more than that, that you can be more than you ever imagined…” 



His eyes glare at mine, hoping for some more words to give him salvation. Salvation isn't mine to give of course nor am I capable of it. The only person who can help is himself in the end, so let us see if he can. 



A voice of fear, regret, and desire comes out of his sad little visage. “What if I end up being a failure in the end? What if I'm just gonna ruin everything? I don't wanna disappoint everyone.”



There's the crux of it all. The fear of letting down anyone or everyone that ever had an inkling of trust in you. The fear of failure. A thing that will never manifest here, we make sure of it. 



“In here, there has and will never be any failures. No matter what you may think, you won't be a failure here. Place your beliefs in us, who place our belief in you.”



“You really think I'm not some failure?”

His warm glare is like a piercing arrow, straight and true. You can do anything and he'll believe it right now with his weak spirit, he just needs something to hold on to. I could easily lie… 



“No, you aren't. Not to this place.”



A smile finally creeps across his face for the first time, a genuine sense of relief and joy. He has something to latch onto in this sterilized building. Seeing this I can't help but feel relieved, now we can actually progress to the last part.



I slide a photo to the boy. It's a photo of John F. Kennedy, the moment right before he was assassinated with a clean splattering shot through the head. The boy looks- no, he stares at the photo with renewed determination. Good, that's the attitude to take. He knows what to do here, something that's been asked of him time and time again. He is to see a glimpse of the past from their perspective. His eyes lose all semblance of light in them as his eyes bore into the photo, but it does not turn to a pale grey. And just as before, he immediately snaps out of that empty state once his nose drips in vivid blood.



His eyes water… The result is disappointingly obvious now.

“I'm so sorry, I still can't see anything.”



Before he says anything more I move to hug the boy. Comfort is the best way to starve off any negative feelings, and I suspect this boy has been deprived of it for so long. His hands grip my back, no cries of course, what he needs is just resolve to try again.



I let the boy go and place him in front of the photo once again. His despair went once more with renewed resolve. His small frail back in view, I can't help but admire his dedication. It was… An interesting reflection. Once more he fails to see, and so a comfort is needed once more. 



A comfort that will be rid of anything weak.



Cold steel stings my hand as I easily aim the device to give the child one last true comfort. A loud bang followed by the splash of red blood echoes through the pure white room. Taking my leave, assistants uniformly file through to dispose of the mess.



 My steps echo through the brightly illuminated sterile white halls, leaving bloody shoe prints among this pure and beautiful facility. Spotting Dr. Pistis, we give each a wave of acknowledgement. I should invite him out to dinner and ask about his daughter some time. With that thought, I spot my next assignment, someone with the potential of possession. Before I enter, the speakers blare the company philosophy once more.



 ***Nobody*** *is a failure here.*

Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

He made me feel crazy","My now ex boyfriend and I were together for 3.5 years. We made it clear in the beginning and throughout the relationship that we both wanted kids and marriage eventually. Everything was going well until the beginning of the year when he tried buying a house that he said would be for us both to live in and grow together but it ended up falling through. During this time I knew he was very stressed with everything and I tried to be helpful and talk with him about things but he ended up basically discarding me and only spending his free time with his family and not talking to me. He told me that I had never bought a house before so that’s why he couldn’t talk to me about it and that I was a burden to talk to and I was the only person in his life that didn’t make his life easier. I knew he didn’t like to be bothered so I wouldn’t text him unless he texted me first and I did not call him to ask to hang out, I always let him be the one to ask to hang out because he felt smothered with too much communication. This really hurt my feelings, I never minded him spending time with his family I just wanted some communication and to be included in conversation since he said the house was for both of us. The only time I got upset with him while he was with his family was one day when we had plans for later that night and he said he had a meeting with the mortgage company that morning. He did not like to be bothered when he was busy so I waited 5-6 hours before calling him. During the time i was waiting, I turned down hanging out with my friends because I knew we had plans together. So I finally call him and he says that he was at his mom’s house talking. I was annoyed just because he did not communicate that plans changed. His family called me manipulative after that even after I explained that I just wanted communication, I did not mind that he was with his family. We had some differences in opinions about the house, he was very tight with money and shot down all my ideas of painting (he said paint was a waste of money and not needed) and putting down flooring in the 2 bedrooms since it was unfinished concrete. I even said that I did not mind helping pay for repairs since I would be living there but still I was shot down about everything you could think of. The house fell through due to the bank deeming it “unlivable”, so I asked if he wanted to move in with me and we could take the next step that way. He said no because he did not want to help pay rent. He had been living rent free in his grandmas house since he was 18 years old. I thought this would be an easy transition since he was already at my apartment like 4 days a week anyways. After the house fell through I did not bring up looking at other houses for sale because he would get very upset with me so I just decided to leave the matter alone.

First he told me we had to wait to get married until he was 30 because that’s how old his dad was when he got married, after he turned 30 he then changed it to I had to pay my car off before getting married because he didn’t want to be with someone in debt and debt is bad. I paid my brand new car off in 17 months and then he changed it to I had to learn to be happy with myself before getting married. I told him I was confused with what he meant because I am completely financially independent, I have a job I love, and I have great relationships with friends and family. I felt like he was always moving the goalposts.

He progressively became meaner and meaner, he always nitpicked me about everything. For example: he called my clothes “slob wear”, the coffee I drank was “bullshit coffee”, the tv shows I watched were dumb, the music I listened to was dumb, and he said I have a fake COVID degree. This was really offensive because I worked very hard for my nursing degree. Every time I said something hurt my feelings he would say “you like when I’m mean”. I truly felt like nothing I did was ever right.

When he told me things that I did or said that he didn’t like I tried to change. Sometimes he would be vague and just say that I was always guilt tripping him. I asked him for examples because I don’t mean to upset him so I want to fix whatever it is and he would respond with “I don’t know I don’t write down everything you do or say”. So I genuinely don’t know what I was supposed to do. When he was upset he usually liked to give the silent treatment which hurt a lot, I tried telling him that talking about things will help rather than keeping things in.

I worked a lot over the past couple of months to pay my car off. We didn’t see each other for almost 2 weeks at one point due to conflicting schedules. When we finally saw each other I was so excited and I asked if he was excited to see me too. He responded with “no not really. I don’t get excited about anything, it’s better to stay neutral about things in life”. I asked if he was okay because that was kind of concerning to me that he didn’t have excitement about ANYTHING in life. I told him that we could talk about it but if he didn’t want to talk with me then maybe he should talk about things with a professional. He said “real men don’t need therapy”.

Before we went on a trip in September, I asked him to go see a movie with me in theaters and he made a big deal about how he didn’t want to go and how stupid it was and why I couldn’t just go with someone else. I told him I had asked other friends but they were all busy and I thought maybe he would be okay with going to one thing I was interested in. I told him I just wish he respected my interests even if he didn’t like them. I used the example of how I don’t like talking about computers or guns but I do it because it’s something he enjoys. I told him that compromise is part of relationships. He told me “well I’m not an actor, I can’t pretend to be interested in the things that you are interested in”. Flash forward after the trip and everything was great honestly, even the day we broke up was a good day at first. I had been cleaning my apartment and he was playing a video game for a couple hours. I get bored doing that so I asked if he wanted to maybe play a game together. And all of sudden his mood just changed and he said “no you don’t like computer stuff, remember? So we’re never playing games again.” I go over the conversation from 2 weeks earlier and about how I still want to do things with him I just want respect. I asked if he was going to hold things over my head forever and he said “I don’t know, maybe. You should learn to choose your words more wisely next time” and he had a smirk on his face.

Nothing fancy, just good coffee, fresh pastries, and regulars who have been coming for years.

For the longest time, our online presence was basically a blurry photo of our menu on Google Maps and whatever people posted on Yelp. I always wanted a clean, simple online menu where people could actually see what we offer, especially tourists walking around with their phones out. But I never had the time, or frankly the patience, to sit down and build something from scratch.

Last month, during a slow week, I gave myself 48 hours to make it happen.

No agencies.

No expensive SaaS.

Just something that looks decent and works.

I used MGX to scaffold the page because I did not feel like wrestling with CSS for two days straight. It handled the layout and styling way faster than I could have, and then I just filled in the items, prices, and pictures myself.

The page in the screenshot above is the real thing.

People started ordering more once they saw the menu online.

Tourists were showing up saying they saw our almond croissant online and had to come try it. Locals were sending the link to friends. Someone even asked if we catered because the menu looked so clean. I am not kidding.

It made our average ticket go up.

It turns out when people can see the desserts laid out nicely, they order them.

It is such a small thing, but for a small business owner, anything that reduces friction helps. And having a clean landing page makes us look like we actually exist in 2025 instead of 1997.

If you run a small café or restaurant and have been putting this off, just build it. It does not have to be complicated. I used MGX because it sped up the boring parts, but use whatever you are comfortable with. The main win is simply having something that looks intentional.

Happy to answer questions if anyone is working on their own menu page.",1,1763556840.0,Atoms_dev,0,1.0,False

To give a short synopsis the breakup was initiated on my behalf after we dated for two years. Things were mostly good at the start but prior to me asking her out there was few red flags where instances she tried to make me jealous in front of other guys and also her displaying a short temper. This short temper and her reactions being disproportionate to the situation increased the months after we became official and became somewhat unbearable that I decided to breakup. She then said she would change and go to therapy and did a few sessions. I found myself sucked back in and we went back to dating over the course of last summer. This time I did notice a shift where she would be more communicative and more controlling of her temper and her mood shifted less. I guess I didn’t feel like I was walking on eggshells anymore. However I was concerned when she told me that she had stopped seeing her therapist after 5 sessions. I then started wonder did she really want genuine change. Then the last few months she became a little bit more clingy than usual (which is fine) but more so to a controlling point. I would be accused of cheating for going to the gym with a friend or she would begin crying if I met a friend for coffee. I felt this linked more to control. This eventually spiralled a bit into her one night ringing my phone over 10 times when I said the electrician was coming to my house. I gave her the time I’d be done and said I would pick her up but she began walking towards my house and said she had been attacked after I rang her back following 10 missed calls and 15 texts. The texts were things like “ do you care” , “are you cheating”. I comforted her after and things went back to normal the next day but I wasn’t gonna question the validity of her story. A few days later I ended the relationship as It didn’t feel right anymore and I didn’t feel like I could live a normal life and be worried about making someone else upset when I’m doing basic activities and also it’s not good for.

We have been broken up a month and she has tried to break no contact twice in the first two weeks. These were “accidental texts” or sending something to friends. Anytime she tried to open dialogue then I would end it with a reaction to her message or “ sorry to hear that, hope things get better”. However three days ago she began asking how I was. Out of politeness I responded but she followed it up with saying how bad things were for her. She then proceeded to call me a few times (which I didn’t answer). She then sent voice notes however I only listened to two and didn’t respond and she then deleted them and said never mind I was just having a moment . She stated in the two voice notes I heard that she was confused by the breakup and wanted to know for sure why I broke up and that she didn’t know if I was taking a breakup to work on myself or move forward in life with other people aswell as if we can be friends in future. I was confused by this because I felt it made clear the relationship was no longer working hence me wanting to end it. It really just sounded like her refusing to accept it’s over and maybe build dialogue. This doesn’t do my healing any good and I feel it affects the healing process and that she is not being respectful of boundaries. Now I also feel obliged to tell her again why I don’t want to continue with the relationship which is annoying because it’s awful thing to do with another human…",1,1763556503.0,ExNoContact,2,1.0,False

I’m in my first corporate role, and for the first year everything felt normal and welcoming. But after two new colleagues joined, the team dynamic shifted a lot, and I’ve been feeling increasingly excluded. For context, my whole team (besides the manager) is female and we’re a small group.

A few things have stood out:

* After they joined, I found out there were multiple full-team lunches I was never invited to. No emails, no messages. I only found out in passing afterwards.
* When I’ve asked if they’re going to certain firm functions, they say no, but then show up together, stick together, and leave together.
* In the office, they all sit and chat together and there’s no space for me, so I end up sitting alone. They don’t initiate conversations unless it’s work-related.
* I usually have to initiate any social interaction, otherwise they just talk amongst themselves. I’ve been told I’m friendly and social, and I’ve never had issues like this at uni or with any other team at work (I've been invited for coffee/lunch many times by other coworkers), so this has really thrown me.

It's now been a few months and nothing has improved. I’m not sure whether this is “normal” in corporate/firm culture, whether I’m overthinking it, or whether it’s something I should raise with someone. Part of me is considering leaving.

Since this is my first corporate job, **I would really like to hear from anyone who's successfully dealt with exclusion or subtle dynamics like this. How did you handle it professionally, and how did you protect your confidence and wellbeing?**

I don’t want this to defeat my confidence or affect my overall relationships at work. I know they are all perfectly nice individually, but I genuinely don’t know where I’ve gone wrong or what my next step should be.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

- Biological female 
- 5’2” on a good day
- Straight 
- Christian
- Single. Never been engaged nor married. 
- No human kids 
- Curvy in all the right places, plus size
- Easy on the eyes
- No tattoos 
- Not a DDS and BBM supporter

I’m a healthcare professional (fancy way of saying I help keep people alive and functioning 🩺). During my days off, I’m probably sipping coffee or matcha at a cozy café, pretending to “study” but actually people-watching… or getting lost in a book I picked up from a bookstore.

I love wearing dresses, strolling through bookstores like it’s a sacred ritual, and going around the city with my earphones in, imagining I’m in the opening scene of a movie chzz haha. I also enjoy for fog-covered mountains, road trips with no real destination, and city lights that feel like they’re winking back at you. Oh, and dogs? Absolutely! 💯 

Currently, I’m on a mission to shed some pounds —starting with daily brisk w@lks during sunset, which has been refreshing but feels like I’m being chased by regrets (or carbs 😂). I’m considering joining a gym soon, but I believe in taking it one step at a time. I hear having a cute fitness buddy boosts motivation... so, you in? 😉 

I’m also a bit of an introvert. I recharge in quiet, meaningful spaces. But if the vibe is right, you’ll see my fun and talkative side 😂

What I’m looking for… A **SINGLE** guy who’s an equally accomplished professional, intelligent, economically secure, respectful, and can start a conversation that goes beyond “hi” and “hello”. Also, **26-37 years old** , someone warm, caring, nice, grounded, endless thoughtful, and just as pleasing to the eyes as the scenery I adore. 

Bonus if you are:
- well dressed: clean, stylish, and just the right amount of classy 👌🏻
- Single. Not in a romantic relationship whatsoever. Never been married. (Best if you can provide a **CENOMAR** when we meet 😂)
- No human kids 
- Christian (genuinely God-fearing)
- Love and/or have dogs
- Enjoy spontaneous long drives
- Can appreciate the charm of bookstores and late-night cafés
- From **Cebu City  or Mandaue City** (easier for coffee dates and spontaneous drives). 
- Not a DDS and BBM supporter

Send me a message and tell me more about yourself such as what do you look like, important aspects in your background, current work, and/or your long-term goals, AND your go-to coffee order too!

A real one, with walls and an address that doesn’t double as my Netflix zone. And now I’m faced with a new dilemma: finding the perfect reception desk. See, I believe reception desks matter. It is the pure representation of how a CEO treats his customers and staff even if you’re still figuring out payroll. A valued staff member is going to sit there, so it needs to scream professionalism without whispering bankruptcy. It needs to be frugal and functional at the same time. I’ve been scrolling through online listings and, of course, stumbled on Alibaba, where the options range from “minimalist chic” to “villain’s lair executive.” Half of them look like they’d need a forklift and a prayer to assemble. So please I need recommendations on what’s functional and appealing.

It's a really long one, so if you're not a fan of reading... I don't know what to tell you.

# Elowyn - The island of 8 themes

Elowyn is an island known for its 8 diverse themes, and 8 different colors.

• Red - Forestcore (The Scarlet Orchard Heights) • Orange - Farmcore (Pumpkinspire Fields) • Yellow - Citycore (Butterscotch City) • Green - Swampcore (Mossfall Bog) • Blue - Coastalcore (Forget-me-not Bay) • Purple - Fairycore (Diana’s Twilight Glade) • Pink - Meadowcore (Blossomthread Meadow) • White - Cottagecore (Elowyn Valley)

When you enter the Dream of Elowyn, you're met with the serene skies and calm music of 5am. You wake in resident services. Make your way down to the airport. Your first impression of Elowyn is nothing short of dull as you wake in Butterscotch City - where ducks roam, and the heavenly smell of coffee fills the air. Yellow flowers line the simple dirt paths, and dot the small field known for its picnics, where the villagers are often joined by ducks, seeking their bread. Here, you find Goldie's cafe, curre​ntly run by Marshal, who is visiting whilst Goldie goes on vacation (AKA, I need her, and Marshal won't move out). Next door is the lovely Frett, an old dog who spent his whole life here, constructing the town and building it up.

To the left of Butterscotch City, you're met by Pumpkinspire Fields, the main food suppliers, growing oranges, pumpkins, and carrots. Home of the lovely Billy, a goat who adores tending to his crops, and occasionally zooming around the island. In Pumpkinspire Fields, the scent of pumpkin pie and nature fills your nose. Its notably more overgrown than the built up Butterscotch City, but it's no less serene. Heading left will take you up to The Scarlet Orchard Heights...

The Scarlet Orchard Heights is the home of Poppy, the lovely red squirrel. She is often found in her tomato garden, or reading in her small, fenced-in picnic spot. If she's not there, she might just be home, baking cherry pies with the very Cherries that she grows and nurtures herself, found growing around the Orchard. Apples are also a delicacy, providing delicious apple jam, pies, and even just a snack to eat right from the trees. Villagers such as Stella, Ursala, and Pate are often found here, enjoying the fruits, company of Poppy, and the shade of the abundance of trees.

Heading north, you'll find yourself within the lovely pink flowers of none other than Blossomthread Meadow - home of Stella, provider of quilts and soft jumpers. And Ursala - who, despite her intimidating appearance as a bear - is actually incredibly sweet and nurturing. She waters the beautiful field every day, and would adore to chat to you over some tea and peach pie. Which - speaking of peach pie - Blossomthread Meadow is home to delicious peaches, and is known for its peach jam, peach pie, and even the lovely peach jelly. Orchid Mantis' are also a native bug, and are often found within the fields and crawling on the flowers.

Down the ramp, you find something far more enchanting - gloomy even - Diana’s Twilight Glade. Many small homes painted in purple and black are common here, home to the fairies. Diana’s Twilight Glade is home to - you guessed it - Diana. She often reads on the crescent moon chairs, or sits beside the glow of nova lights late at night, watching for the fairies. Purple flowers are an abundance here, giving the glade a more witch-like appearance, giving it the gloomy beauty it is so well known for.

As you head right, you are met with something brighter. Something sunny. Forget-me-not Bay. The Coastal Town, ​painted in gorgeous blues and whites, flowers and palm trees clustered together. A pool party southwards, with free ice lollies, delicacy of Pate. Pate and Jeremiah live together on the cliff of the Bay. Their homes decorated gorgeously, with ocean views, fishing gear and reading nooks. It reminds you of Coastal new England, which it is heavily inspired by.

Heading south, you find the swamp. Mossfall Bog. This area is known for green mums, black Cosmos, and yellow lilies, and of course - Moss. Henry, a lovely little frog, lives on the beach of the swamp. He spends most of his days indoors, researching bugs, investigating strange moss and mushrooms growing in the swamp, and tending to his flowers - gifts from his best friend Ursala. Life in the swamp isn't ideal, but my is there so much to do. And finally, heading right, you're right back in Butterscotch City.

You may find yourself drawn back to the views of the construction site. And you spot a secret. Nestled between the trees, there's a bridge. And as you cross over, you realise where you are - Elowyn Valley. Home of the resident representative. It is white and cottagecore. White pumpkins and pale wheat grows here. Books and trees all around. It's the heart of Elowyn. Hopping across the river, you find a picnic spot, and hopping again, there's a rainbow flower field. Colors of all the different areas. And finally, you have finished. You have explored the magical island. And so you head back to Luna, and close your eyes. When you wake back on your own island, I hope you find yourself inspired.

\- Brooke, writer and island representative and designer of Elowyn.

1p16oqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1p16oqg/dodged_a_bullet_had_my_revenge/,"Dodged a bullet, had my revenge.","Throw away account, because my ex still follows my main account.

So this all started when I was 15/16 and I had my first boyfriend, let's call him Luke for this post. He was 23 at this time. Now I know that this was the first red flag, at least for this age gab and my age at the time.

So I was a pretty much on my own since I was 8. My mom died at the time and my dad chose work and bars over parenting, but provided me with the standards, food at home, roof over my head, clothes, school stuff, a little bit of money and that's it. I put myself through school and did the household, cooked basic stuff, etc.

So when I was 15 and met my first boyfriend every time I was at his place I did it there too. We were together for 2 years and over these two years I was in school, worked part time at McDonalds, had the household with my dad and practically my Luke's household. All while Luke focused on his master degree and what I learned later, after I broke up with him) other girls. He literally let me clean his place, told me then he needed to learn, so I would leave and invite other girls over. (I know I was stupid, but I thought at this time, that finally somebody cared about me). After finishing my school I applied for college and got accepted, it's super near my hometown so I did't had to move and was super happy.

Luke told me, I didn't need to go to college, he could provide for us both, and so on. He goes so far trying to forbid it. Luckily it was around this time my dad got sober, in therapy and took a part in my life again. He told me that if I want to go to college, it's my decision, not Luke's. (Surprise my dad didn't liked Luke). I had a lot of fights with Luke at this time, but what broke the camels back was the first time he hit me. I drew a line at this exact moment, broke up with him and never looked back.

At the age of 21 I got therapy and processed everything. I forgave my dad and he's proofs everyday that this was the right choice.

**But know**,. **15 years later I had my petty revenge.** Some might say I was asshole, but I can live with it.

I'm (now 31) married for two years with my husband 'Everett' (fake name, 38). Yes I know same age gap, but when we met I was 26, much more appropriate. We have an inherited company together, with around 75 employees.

It's a small field we're specialize in, so there are not many options in our area to work this job. We're also paying more than average, a lot of paid PTO (up to 40 days) and some other benefits, because we're firm believers of happy employees doing good work.

Take a guess who's application for an open position came in the other day? Right. Luke's. My first thought was to decline directly. But after thinking and talking with my husband about it, I decided to get a little petty revenge.

Because we have so many applications per position we're doing up to five rounds of interviews, sorting out until we have the perfect one. We communicate this with everybody and most of the time we're ending up with hiring the last two, because we have enough workload. This is pretty known about our company and we are happy so give more than one person the opportunity to work for/with us..

So my husband did the first three rounds and in the end he invited 2 people to the last round and even wrote in the confirmation mail for the next round something along the lines 'please bring all the important documents with you, there is a big chance we're hiring you...' Luke was on of the two, and when he came back a few days later for the last round of his interview, the look on his face when he saw me sitting next to Everett was priceless. Everett introduced me as his wife, co owner and the final decision maker.

Everett and I did the interview professional as always, but told him in the end, that he is not the right candidate for our company, there are too many moral discrepancies. He lost it completely, yelled at us and threatened us. In his mind I was not over him (false) and still jealous. Apparently he already quit in his previous job (not my problem) and need this job to support his kids and himself. After some time we called security and got him escorted.

Since then we needed to file one harassment lawsuit against him and one restraining order, but since then it's quit. I randomly met one of his former friends today in a coffee shop while waiting in line.

So here's the tea about Luke's life:

* three kids, from three women in time span of 15 month
* there were different lies in his CV
* many complaints about sexual harassment about him in his old companies
* five years on parole for sex with someone under 14 (He was 27, she was 13 - i could vomit just thinking about this)

Ben is 25~, the rest of us are 18/19. my boyfriend and I have had a friend or two over at the flat a few times, but we are always conscious of how loud we are once it gets late and our friends usually leave around 9 at the latest. we are quite clean people and our rooms stay tidy, we clean up any mess we make in the kitchen before we leave, the only thing we ever leave for later is dishes but they are always done by the next day at the latest. 

Ben however is the polar opposite. He keeps us up until 2, 3 and 4 am regularly on weeknights - having multiple friends over, shouting and laughing really loudly with his tv always on max volume as well as playing his guitar until late. I have made a separate post on this guy in r/AITAH when i finally made a formal noise complaint about him after speaking nicely to him numerous times to no avail.

when it comes to the kitchen, Ben is absolutely disgusting. the worktops are absolutely covered in sugar, crumbs, stains, milk, coffee etc. he leaves his dirty dishes all over the counters and his dirty pots on the stove until literal mould grows in it. when this first started, i was regularly deep cleaning the entire kitchen by myself with rubber gloves - sometimes twice a week. i even bought air fresheners and antibacterial spray for the whole flat to use to try motivate him to clean up after himself. 

i did text our groupchat and politely asked that everyone wiped the counters down after they were finished as i didn’t want to shame him personally infront of the rest of the flat. i mentioned that i had cleaned it from top to bottom again as it was filthy. he left me on opened and instead replied to my boyfriend’s message that was unrelated.

it’s really starting to grate on me. i refuse to keep cleaning the entire kitchen when its not me leaving it in such a revolting state. i dont know if Ben thinks that just because im the only girl im going to act like a mother but im at my wits end now. the kitchen absolutely stinks to high heaven and it makes the whole hallway stink. there has been a butter knife covered in god knows what STUCK to the counter for TWO WEEKS now. anything he spills just sits there until someone else cleans it. we failed our last kitchen inspection because of him and i’m actually embarrassed to bring my friends over because of how gross it is.

By Eric Onstad

LONDON (Reuters) -The West's push to build a home-grown magnets supply chain to reduce its reliance on China - led by massive U.S. backing for Nevada-based MP Materials - is running into a critical problem: the scarcity of so-called heavy rare earth elements.

The United States and allies have been scrambling to create an alternative supply chain to make super-strong rare earth magnets, which are vital components in everything from defence technology and electric vehicles, to electronics and wind turbines.

MP Materials aims to integrate the entire supply chain from mining rare earths to magnet production and has ambitious plans to produce magnets within years, buoyed by a July deal comprising billions of dollars in U.S. government support.

It trumpeted its success earlier this month, boosting processed output of two light rare earths by 51% this quarter.

But shortages of heavy elements dysprosium and terbium could be an Achilles heel for MP Materials and the West's campaign to forge a magnets industry away from geopolitical turbulence that has constricted supply from China, analysts say.

MP's Mountain Pass mine in California contains only traces of those two elements, which are used in small quantities in the magnets but are vital. Dysprosium and terbium help magnets retain their magnetic qualities under high temperatures, such as in EV engines.

""MP Materials may have a formidable challenge,"" said Ilya Epikhin, senior principal with consultants Arthur D. Little. ""They'll need to go to Brazil or Malaysia, or some African states to find those resources, but it can take a lot of time.""

In an analysts conference call on November 6, Chief Operating Officer Michael Rosenthal said MP was ""actively engaged"" with a number of potential feedstock providers for heavies, but did not name them.

Another source of feedstock will be recycled materials supplied by Apple that contain heavy rare earths under a $500 million deal for MP to supply magnets to the tech giant.

""We believe we are very well positioned,"" MP's Matt Sloustcher, executive vice president of corporate affairs, told Reuters. 

MP is a high-profile example of the impact of continued dependency by the West on China for heavy rare earth processing. According to consultancy Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, the West will still rely on China for 91% of its heavy rare earths needs by 2030, down only slightly from 99% in 2024.

Chinese export restrictions imposed in April on heavy rare earths in the magnets have in some cases suspended operations at auto plants and jolted the West into action. On October 30, Beijing agreed to delay new controls under a U.S.-China deal.

SCRAMBLE TO LINE UP HEAVIES

The proportion of heavy rare earths in deposits is much smaller than the other elements used in magnets, with the relative ratio of heavy rare earths in global mines only half of their relative ratio in permanent magnets. 

The scarcity of heavy rare earths outside of China is evident in the price of dysprosium oxide in Rotterdam at $900 per kg, more than triple the price in China of $255, according to data provider Fastmarkets. 

**""If you talk about critical resources, it's really the heavies, the heavies, the heavies - all the rest we will get,"" said Erik Eschen, CEO of Germany's Vacuumschmelze (VAC), one of the few rare earth magnet producers outside China.**

VAC has been busy inking deals with miners that produce heavy rare earths to supply its new U.S. plant in South Carolina that recently opened.

VAC has agreed supply deals for heavy rare earths with Canada's privately-held Torngat Metals from its Strange Lake project in Quebec and Aclara Resources from its Carina project in Brazil. 

""Even with limited capacity in the West, we're succeeding at securing the capacity we need,"" Eschen said.

Magnet production capacity outside of China and Japan is expected to hit 70,000 metric tons a year by 2030, which would need 1,650 tons a year of dysprosium oxide, according to critical minerals consultancy Adamas Intelligence.

""Heavies are definitely the next piece of the puzzle that needs to be dealt with to unlock widespread Western magnet production at scale,"" said Adamas managing director Ryan Castilloux.

Despite the flurry of recent deals and rhetoric in the West, mines outside of China are forecast to meet only 29% of the heavy rare earths consumed outside China in the auto and wind sectors by 2035, according to data from London-based commodity consultancy CRU.

""To close this gap, more mine supply will be needed with costs higher than the current supply base,"" said Piyush Goel at CRU.

PROJECTS TO TAKE YEARS

A wide range of companies have been publicising new projects and processing facilities for heavy rare earths, but most of them will take many years to come to fruition.

The two biggest Western firms in the sector, MP Materials and Lynas Rare Earths of Australia, are both looking for additional ore to process since their own mines are not rich enough in heavy elements.

Lynas kicked off heavy rare earth separation earlier this year in Malaysia, becoming the world’s first such producer outside China. 

The Australian group announced last month it would expand output of heavy rare earths to 250 metric tons of dysprosium and 50 tons of terbium a year, but gave no timeline, saying it depended on regulatory approvals.

CEO Amanda Lacaze told analysts on a call on October 30 that Lynas planned to source heavy rare earths both from its own Mt. Weld mine in Australia and from Malaysia, where its processing plant is located.

""We have a team whose job it is to work with various Malaysian partners on that development process.""

This contrasts with a global deficit forecast by CRU by 2035 of 2,920 tons in the supply/demand balance of dysprosium and terbium oxides.

Another Australian company, Iluka Resources, is building a refinery at Eneabba in Western Australia that will eventually be able to process up to 750 tons a year of heavy rare earths. It is expected to be commissioned in 2027.

The company told Reuters it has moderate amounts of heavy rare earths in its own material and has agreed a deal with Northern Minerals to supply heavy rare earths from its new mine in Western Australia, due to start production in 2028.

MP MATERIALS' MINE HAS SCANT HEAVIES

MP Materials, which owns the only U.S. rare earths mine, aims to eventually lift magnet output to 10,000 metric tons a year.

It plans to launch a heavy rare earth separation facility next year that will eventually be able to produce 200 tons a year of dysprosium and terbium.

But MP Materials' mine produces mainly light rare earths, with its deposit containing less than 1.8% medium and heavy rare earths.

MP said it has stockpiled several hundred tons of medium and heavy rare earth concentrate in preparation for magnet production, but this only contains 4% dysprosium and terbium, according to the company's website.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS SEEN AS BOTTLENECK

Brazil is emerging as a major heavy rare earth (HREE) ore exporter, but the real challenge lies in processing capacity, said Neha Mukherjee, a rare earths analyst with Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.

""While the technology for HREE refining is expected to be available globally by 2029, costs outside of China remain 5–7 times higher,"" Mukherjee said.

Higher amounts of heavy rare earths are found in ionic clay mine deposits, where the standard extraction technique involves flushing the deposit with chemicals, which in Myanmar has caused contamination of water supplies and deforestation.

Western miners say they use environmentally-friendly extraction methods, but they have sometimes met with scepticism and opposition by residents to mine plans.

Rare earth mining of deposits from monazite ore includes radioactive elements uranium and thorium, which can be difficult to dispose of safely.

""A key bottleneck for new production will be the higher negative impact of heavy rare earth mining and processing on the local environment,"" CRU's Goel said.

Some companies, including VAC, have produced magnets without heavy rare earths, but they have limited applications, such as slow-moving wind turbines, said Eschen.

""The moment you go into other applications, for example, a motor for EVs, turning very fast, going 120, 140 degrees Celsius, then you need the heavies.""

https://reddit.com/link/1p16o6x/video/ro1j7nuhd72g1/player

The United States has known for years that its economy runs on materials that it can’t control. The rare-earth metals that power F-35 fighter jets, electric vehicles, and iPhones [mostly comes from one place: China](https://fortune.com/2025/11/17/us-aims-breathe-easy-china-chokehold-rare-earths/). 

Now, after years of warnings, that dependence has turned from an abstract vulnerability into a central fault line in global trade. An [agreement](https://fortune.com/2025/11/01/china-rare-earth-export-curbs-suspension-probes-us-chip-firms/) between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this month has pulled the U.S. back from the brink of panic, at least for now, but the supply chain’s long-term vulnerability remains.

Beijing’s planned rules, due to take effect December 1, would have required a licence for any company anywhere in the world exporting even trace amounts of rare-earth materials that originated in China. Analysts warned that enforcement of those controls could have slowed or halted production across entire industries, particularly hitting the automotive sector.

The agreement buys the U.S. a little time—a year’s worth—to get a handle on rare-earth minerals. But experts say it doesn’t fix the rot that put America in this position in the first place: decades of overcaution and underfunding.

**A crisis years in the making**

Georgetown Law scholar Peter Harrell, a former senior White House and State Department official who advised both the Trump and Biden administrations on supply-chain security, said the vulnerabilities were well understood inside Washington long before the current flare-up. 

“This is not a new problem,” he said in an interview with *Fortune*.

For a lot of policymakers, Harrell added, the first time the gap began to register was in 2011, when China cut off rare-earth exports to Japan during a maritime dispute. That incident—sometimes referred to as the “[poster child](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/revisiting-china-japan-rare-earths-dispute-2010)” for how trade could get weaponized in geopolitical conflict—panicked Japan enough to prompt it to [reduce its reliance](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/10/japan-rare-earth-minerals/) on China’s rare-earth exports from 90% to 60%. 

 That episode, he said, triggered “a flurry of activity” at the Pentagon and among U.S. allies. The Obama administration’s initial efforts were mostly diagnostic; Trump’s first term funded a handful of pilot mining and processing projects; Biden’s term added a diplomatic layer through the Minerals Security Partnership, a U.S.-led alliance across a dozen nations to secure global supply chains for critical minerals. 

But collectively, Harrell argued, those efforts fell short because “it’s hard to get the government to focus on problems that aren’t urgent, take years to solve, and cost real money.” For a while, the threat seemed theoretical. Until now.

Former USTR and Treasury official Emily Kilcrease, who is currently a fellow at the think tank Center for a New American Security, agreed that Washington’s failure stemmed not from ignorance but from misplaced faith in markets. 

“The private market for rare earths is not going to get us what we need,” she said. “It’s dominated by China. Companies can’t compete on price alone.”

China’s state-directed system—fueled by subsidies, loose environmental standards, and an aggressive industrial policy—has gutted its competitors. Rare earths have long given Beijing outsized global leverage **despite being a** relatively small financial investment. The industry itself generates roughly $50 billion a year in revenue—a figure cited by Ahmad Ghahreman, CEO of Cyclic Materials—yet it underpins multi-trillion-dollar sectors including defense, electric vehicles, renewable energy, and consumer electronics.

By heavily subsidizing refining and magnet-making throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Beijing secured a near-monopoly over global production, Ghareman told *Fortune*. Today, China accounts for about 70% of rare-earth mining and nearly 90% of processing capacity, according to the U.S. Geological Survey and OECD trade data. That dominance allows China to wield export restrictions as a geopolitical tool at little economic cost to itself but enormous potential disruption abroad—a dynamic that, as Kilcrease put it, has turned rare earths into “a choke point” for the world’s most advanced supply chains.

China, however, had always “exercised restraint” in leveraging that choke point against the, Kilcrease said.

**The scramble** 

That changed this year. China’s new export restrictions have hit at the heart of Western manufacturing just as demand for EV motors and data-center hardware soars. Inside Washington, the response has been a scramble to design an industrial policy for a supply chain that barely exists.

The most ambitious step so far is the $8.5 billion U.S.–Australia [rare-earth framework, ](https://fortune.com/2025/10/21/washington-rare-earth-pact-china-australia-8-billion-four-decades/)backed by the U.S. Defense Department and the Export-Import Bank. The pact blends loans, subsidies, and purchase guarantees to keep allied producers alive even if Beijing floods the market to crash prices.  

Still, experts say the framework barely makes a dent against the problem. For one, the agreement covers mainly neodymium and praseodymium, which are only two of the 17 rare-earth elements.

 “There are a dozen other rare earths and twenty other critical minerals that need the same attention,” Harrell warned. “You’ve got to sustain focus across the whole set, not just a couple of them.”

Also, Australia holds the world’s fourth-largest deposits of rare earths, but at 5.7 million metric tons of rare-earth oxide equivalents, its industry is dwarfed by China’s 44 million.

For Kilcrease, the deal is part of a larger shift away from Washington’s long-standing faith in markets and toward a recognition that the state has to play a more direct role. She said the move fits into a broader pattern of “a more kind of muscular industrial policy,” pointing to recent U.S. equity stakes in companies like [Intel](https://fortune.com/company/intel/) and U.S. Steel.

 “These are all part of the same trend,” Kilcrease said. “The government is getting more involved to make sure we have a reliable supply of the materials that keep our economy running.”

Inside Washington, the policymaking process itself has also changed. 

“The interagency process under the second Trump administration is fundamentally different than we’ve ever seen before,” Kilcrease said.

 She described a White House that no longer waits for staff-level policy proposals: “It’s the president sitting down with the Treasury secretary or the Commerce secretary and figuring out how to come up with the commercial and government deal that resolves the problem.”

**Reuse, recycle**

While Washington works through that new approach, industry is trying to fill the gap on its own. Ghareman said.

“We started Cyclic Materials because we really knew this was coming,” he said. “I had been working on a study for the government of Canada on rare-earth deposits, and I concluded that we needed a business whose revenue wasn’t entirely dependent on mining rare earths.”

Ghareman’s company extracts magnets and metals from used products like e-bikes, power tools, and electric motors. 

“In our first facility in Arizona, we’ll process about 25,000 tons per year of end-of-life products,” he said. “That produces about 750 tons of magnet material per year that goes into our second technology, where we produce rare-earth oxides and nickel-cobalt hydroxide.”

 The Arizona plant and a companion facility in Kingston, Ontario are expected to begin full commercial operation in the first half of next year.

Recycling, he said, can’t eliminate the need for mining but can relieve pressure on the system.

 “Both of them need to coexist if we ever have a vision of decarbonizing our planet,” Ghareman said. “Recycling uses five percent of the water that mining consumes and about a third of the carbon footprint.” 

Heavy rare-earth elements, he added, remain the most critical: “Ninety-nine percent of heavy rare earths today are mined and supplied by China. The only realistic sources outside China are new mines and recycling.”

The most common heavy rare-earth elements—dysporosium, terbium, and yttrium—are used in the heavy-duty magnets which power EV motors and military tech. 

In Ghareman’s view, “government support for the next five to ten years is going to be critical” if the U.S. and its allies want to compete.

For now, that support is coming slowly. Harrell said the U.S.–Australia deal and smaller Pentagon [contracts](https://fortune.com/2025/08/12/rare-earths-magnets-mp-materials-stock-surge-landmark-deals-trump-apple/) with mining companies like MP Minerals are a start, but warned that “the question is going to be, are we able to sustain this level of attention and this level of resources to actually solve the problem? Or, you know, six months or a year from now, do we move on to something else?”

Ghareman sounded a similar note of urgency. He said China’s pattern of tightening export controls—from equipment restrictions in 2023 to the expansion of those controls this year—shows how fast the landscape is shifting. 

“You can connect the dots and project it to the future,” he said. “Speed to execution and bringing the full supply chain to the U.S. and allied countries is going to be important.”

If the U.S. wants to end its dependence on China, he said, it will have to move faster than it ever has before. 

***“We’re just getting started,” Ghareman said. “But we don’t have time to waste.”***

# 🔥 IMHO: Why Heavy Rare Earths (Dy/Tb) Will also Make NioCorp a Strategic Monster once financed.🔥

Everyone keeps looking at Nd/Pr, magnets, EVs, “China this, China that” — but the global rare earth crisis isn’t in the lights at all. ***It’s in the heavies. Dysprosium (Dy) and Terbium (Tb) are the temperature-stabilizing elements that make permanent magnets work in jet engines, hypersonics, naval systems, missile guidance, and EV drivetrains. MP Materials has almost none.*** Lynas has limited supply. Australia and Brazil will take years to scale. **A Reuters investigation basically confirmed the global supply chain has no solution for Dy/Tb in the next 5–7 years. And right in that supply vacuum? \~ NioCorp — one of the very few U.S. projects with meaningful Dy/Tb as a byproduct, plus Sc, Nb, Ti, Nd/Pr, and the whole critical-mineral suite the Pentagon wants.**

Here’s the part most retail investors are missing: Dy/Tb have already been in DoD test loops. Mark Smith and Jim Sims have hinted for years that Niocorp has quietly supplied REE concentrates (including heavy fractions) to multiple labs for evaluation. That’s because before the Pentagon can sign offtakes or Title III contracts, they must validate metal quality, oxide purity, reduction behavior, and magnet-grade specs. **If you think the DoD is waiting around until 2026 to start testing, you’re crazy — they’ve BEEN testing. And the decarbonization + defense worlds are both desperate for any Western Dy/Tb tonnage!**

**MORE CORE = MORE ORE\~ is where this gets explosive:** If Elk Creek’s assays continue trending toward a potential 1M tonne TREO expansion scenario — (which is realistic & within grasp) — **NioCorp becomes a first-of-its-kind U.S. heavy REE stream, wrapped inside a Niobium/Scandium/Titanium Megaproject.** That’s why Mark said **“first come, first serve.”** He’s not talking retail shares.

\*\*\*\***He’s talking offtake priority. Whoever signs first gets guaranteed Dy/Tb supply before the world wakes up to how rare these elements truly are!!!\*\*\***

**Bottom line:** If you’re only watching Scandium or Niobium or Titanium & Nd/Pr, you’re missing the forest for the trees *(in addition to the ScAl vertical integrations with defense Prime Lockheed & the DOD)*   ***The other real monster here — the part Wall Street hasn’t priced in***  — **is that NioCorp might quietly become America’s first scalable domestic source of Dy/Tb, the two most bottlenecked critical minerals on the planet. And once that reality clicks? The valuation ceiling disappears.**

# 🔥 NIOCORP: IS the ONLY U.S. Project Capable of Producing **Seven Critical Oxides — Pending Final Financing 🔥

Most people still don’t understand what NioCorp actually becomes **once fully financed**. If Elk Creek gets its long-awaited construction capital, the project will enter 2028/2029 as **the ONLY vertically integrated U.S. facility capable of producing all seven of these strategic oxides on one site**:

* **Niobium oxide** (Nb₂O₅)
* **Scandium oxide** (Sc₂O₃) & \*\*\***Scandium Aluminum Alloys w/Defense primes & DoD** *(Huge vertical integration potential)*
* **Titanium dioxide** (TiO₂) **& ""Tickle"" - \*\*\*\*TiCl₄ (“tickle-4”) is the key feedstock used to make titanium metal!**
* **Neodymium oxide**
* **Praseodymium oxide**
* **Dysprosium oxide**
* **Terbium oxide**

**No other domestic project has that breadth**! MP Materials? Light REEs only. Lynas USA? Light-only separation. Rare Element Resources? Pilot scale and Wyoming-limited. **But NioCorp’s flowsheet —** ***pending financing*** **— produces the** **full suite**, including the ultra-constrained heavies (Dy/Tb) that DoD, Lockheed, and GE desperately need for hypersonics, jet engines, and high-temperature magnets.

**\*\*\*And this isn’t speculation:** Mark Smith, Jim Sims, Scott Honan and the 2022 Feasibility Study all confirm the plan to produce **all seven oxides on-site**, **with heavy rare earth separations integrated directly into the hydromet plant — again,** ***pending finance***\*\*.\*\*

**If** assays continue trending toward the potentially expanded TREO resource (approaching that possible \~1M tonne scenario), the Elk Creek Project becomes even more critical. But everything hinges on the major catalyst: **final funding**. **Once the capital structure is secured, the roadmap is clear — construction, commissioning, and first oxide output by late 2028/2029!**

**Conclusion:**

The capability is real, the flowsheet is validated, and the resource base keeps growing stronger with every assay. Demand across all seven oxides is surging, and the only remaining catalyst is the financing that will activate America’s first full-spectrum, fully domestic critical-minerals oxide complex.

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

I claimed my insurance, but they have reverted back mentioning that I might have to pay the excess as they cannot confirm if I am not at fault. Anyone had similar experience or idea on what will happen in this case?

It's just us two going, so no child restrictions or anything and we are both over 30.

This trip is actually not going to be a long one in just London as we are actually traveling to a few places around Europe and spending just 3 or so days in each location. So we have 3 full days in London. We do have a show at West End (Hercules) and and a show in Bristol (The Greatest Showman). 

I know for the Bristol show it'll be a large part of the day there since it's about an hour and a half train ride over there and back, plus getting to the Hippodrome, and we figured we'd get dinner there before the show at 7:30. 

So my question is what are some must see/must do items? Things we are looking for are foodie places/coffee/desserts, historical items, generally fun things to do (I'm a bit of a kid at heart and I definitely want to do the super long slide thing!), some speakeasy/cocktail areas, one nice place to dinner at together.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1p16jyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_JuniorBodybuilder472/comments/1p16jyu/built_different_inside_the_culture_of_jdi/,"Built Different: Inside the Culture of JDI Contracts in Grand Rapids, Minnesota","Grand Rapids, Minnesota, is the kind of place where people build things that last. Big projects. Hard problems. Real results. It’s home to [JDI Contracts](https://www.jdicontracts.com/), a team that brings engineering know-how and hands-on experience to every site they touch.  


# A Different Kind of Engineer

https://preview.redd.it/8z6f6j0ck72g1.png?width=250&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ae2429705f87cc8152e25631ae6be39c4db77fb

For Dave Schaeffer, Project Manager and Contract Coordinator at JDI, no two days are ever alike. “Every project is exciting and different,” he says. “Different problems, different opportunities — every day there’s something new to figure out.”

He’s quick to point out that engineers aren’t all cut from the same cloth. “You’ve got the ones who want to maintain systems, the ones who enjoy making incremental improvements — and then you’ve got project engineers. The people who wake up in the morning and think, what’s in front of me today that I can take apart and put back together?”

Those are JDI people. They thrive on forward motion — the kind of engineers who don’t want to sit behind a desk all day adjusting spreadsheets. “Field engineers are built differently,” Dave says. “They’d get bored if their job was just data and routine. It’s a different mindset entirely.”

# “Free with Boundaries”

JDI’s culture can be summed up in three words: free with boundaries. It’s an idea that sounds simple, but it’s what makes the team effective. Everyone knows their limits, but within those guardrails, they have the freedom to move fast and make decisions.

“As a project manager, I don’t have to wait for approval to answer a client’s question,” Dave explains. “I’m empowered to respond right away. That kind of flexibility is rare — and it’s what makes JDI so responsive.”

Clients feel that difference immediately. They know they’re working with people who can give real answers in real time, backed by deep technical experience. And when something does need tracking down, JDI’s engineers aren’t spinning their wheels — they’re already on the phone with the right person to get clarity.

# Communication Is the Secret Sauce

If you ask Dave what kind of problems JDI solves, he’ll tell you most of them don’t start with machinery or materials — they start with communication. “A lot of project issues are just people not talking to each other,” he says. “Once we get the right folks in the same conversation at the right time, things fall into place.”

At JDI, documentation is treated as seriously as design. The team keeps meticulous records of conversations, decisions, and changes — not for paperwork’s sake, but because it keeps projects aligned. “It’s how we make sure everyone knows how we got here,” Dave adds. “Good communication is what keeps a project from drifting off course.”

# Translators Between Worlds

JDI’s team isn’t just technically sharp — they’re bilingual in the language of the field and the office. They can talk to millwrights, ironworkers, and operators, understand what they’re asking, and turn that into precise, actionable direction for engineers and project teams.

“We know a little bit about a lot of things,” Dave says with a grin. “We can walk into a facility, listen to what’s going on, and translate it into something the technical side can act on.”

That bridge-building ability is what sets JDI apart. They turn field experience into engineering solutions — fast. When a client is under pressure, JDI’s people don’t just relay the question; they refine it, define it, and push it toward resolution.

# Why Clients Keep Coming Back

[JDI Contracts INC office in Grand Rapids, Minnesota](https://preview.redd.it/cqh7ddqik72g1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7cfc76a395c613374f6c4e33026aaf4433af2f1)

  
Many of JDI’s clients come to them because they don’t have full in-house engineering departments or need extra hands to coordinate across multiple partners. That’s where JDI shines.

They track change orders, manage documentation, and advocate for both the contractor and the client. “We sit in the middle — we’re not just managing timelines; we’re making sure communication and documentation are solid all the way through,” Dave explains.  


Unlike large “big-E” firms that design everything from a distance, JDI gets out there. Their engineers and coordinators walk the site, ask questions, and listen. It’s a boots-on-the-ground approach that earns trust — and keeps projects running smoothly.

# The Grand Rapids Way of Life

https://preview.redd.it/6xtexmcnk72g1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=06ece72de4c193b5257ce91fe64e2cf16d18ba3c

Ask anyone at JDI why they stay, and their answers go beyond the work. Grand Rapids offers something that’s hard to find elsewhere: space and connection.

“There are people here who love living outside the big cities,” Dave says. “You get to be outdoors, you get more time with family, and your money goes farther. You see more deer than cars — and honestly, that’s how we like it.”

It’s not just the slower pace — it’s the relationships. The morning coffee crowd includes the same faces, day after day, and there’s comfort in that. “You get to actually know people,” Dave says. “You sit down, talk about life, and maybe solve the world’s problems before 8 a.m.”

That sense of community bleeds into the work itself. Projects at JDI don’t just succeed because the team is technically excellent — they succeed because people care. About their clients. About their teammates. About building things that last.",1,1763555797.0,u_JuniorBodybuilder472,0,1.0,False

Much before than I came into her life, but still feeling bad.

I am a virgin, never touched a woman, but only had one-sided and one very short online relationship without any nudes (just a small one). Now my girlfriend on the other hand has, let's say, a lot of baggage that's now affecting me. Her first boyfriend of 2 years never publicly made them official and always used her in hotels for sex (no handjob, no penetration, and she gave him no oral). Then started her multiple online casuals, after which she met a much older 27-28 year old dude on a random video sharing website but he ""healed"" her from all those casuals. Within 5 days of connecting with her, he came to her city and they went to a very nice hotel, he told her he wanted to give her a ""good time"". He took her to a hotel room, talked sweetly, and she thought he loved her, so she gave in and told him he's allowed to touch her, so he did (with his fingers and tongue). She also touched him, but still no jerking him off or no penetration or oral from her side, but he ate her and made her cum. They hooked up like this twice, made out in hotels, and he got married (but still kept replying to her whatsapp stories with ""beautiful"" and all that bullshit). After him, her online casuals started again.

Now I enter her life. Again, I am an online dude and know her for about 2 months now, and we are in a serious relationship. We are healthy on all grounds, ALL fucking grounds, except her past. She's an amazing girlfriend, but I just can't imagine she gave in to that guy within 5 days of them just connecting online by him just talking ""sweetly"" to her. I'm not jealous of her first boyfriend of 2 years, and don't care about those casuals. But that one dude who gave her oral sex makes my blood boil. She did cum with him, on both nights they spent months apart. I feel like butchering his skull. I asked her much earlier in our relationship if she had moved on (of course in great detail), to which I got to know that before connecting with me she used to miss that 27 year old fella. But doesn't anymore, because of the love I give her... She has completely moved on now... at least in what she says.

Just a couple days ago she told me that when they were together, he said to her that they had ""karmic relationship"". She also told me the same night that with them everything was ""pure"". Now I don't feel as important to her, even though she loves me a lot and cries and gifts me weeks where whole weeks with me on video calls and what not. It's THE PERFECT relationship, just not her past comes back to me, nobody else but me, 27 year old guy. I keep having visuals of him eating her out, sucking her boobs, kissing her neck, her lips. I can't even watch porn or anything related, and I've told this to her. Both of us have already done everything online, shared everything with each other, and I know that I'll be okay as soon as we actually make it to offline and start getting physical. It's just that we aren't getting together anytime soon, and I am relying just on time that this retroactive jealousy goes away soon. I don't want to. It's horrible. Really horrible.

I keep imagining that we have spent 2 months sexting, but never got a chance to meet. But that one guy who ""healed"" her after her many many mentally torturing casuals got her in his arms and could have done anything within to her, even could have made her pregnant by how ""sweet"" he was. I keep asking her ""Why a fucking hotel within the first meeting? Why not coffee, or a trip, or some nice activity?"" to which she is completely aloof and might still believe they had a ""karmic relationship"" and things happened naturally. I explained it to her that he manipulated her for her body, and he never committed, and he never intended to stay forever or marry.

Fucker left her after eating her out in a ""nice hotel"" and now destroying my brain. She is always my small baby princess who is very cute, very smart and mature, cares for me, everything is soooo perfect. But just as I remember that she's not a baby anymore and that another guy has already done enough to make her feel like a woman, I feel like killing him RIGHT NOW. Everytime I have thoughts of her sleeping in his arms I feel what they had has no competition and our relationship can never be as ""pure"" or ""karmic"" as theirs even though I don't believe in all that bullshit. I want my wife to be completely mine, with her heart mind and body. She is completely mine but just a couple of days ago when she said about him and her being ""pure"" I felt like betrayed.

Sometimes I help it by talking myself out of this by reasoning with it (like the screenshot below), why I'm feeling this way. But goddamn it, I can't stop it permanently once and for all. I love my baby, but she doesn't feel like my baby butler I get reminded of her with a ""sweet and old guy in a nice hotel"".

She's saving her virginity for marriage, and I'm like madam husbands are not only for baby making. Husbands want to have other things first too, I want to be the first to kiss her neck, fondle with her body, lick her belly and eat her out and then have penetration, NOT JUST penetration. Her mindset just doesn't sit right, as if it's wrong and MEANT to have devulge husbands in front of any past boyfriends. She has apologized a lot, even apologized with ""I'm sorry my past is affecting your mental health. I don't want you to suffer, if you want to leave me I'm fine with that"". I love her but do I love her enough? Goddamn.

I'm so angry at that bastard, but somehow I have made a mental image of that man as being the best man who can get anyone and please anyone, especially my girl (because duh, he has done that already). I feel like a baby, and he feels like a man. I don't want to be a baby, I want to be a man. Motherfucker left her and never had any intentions of marrying. He's not in her life anymore, and I've gotten him blocked everywhere now, she understands me. I have seen so many videos on retroactive jealousy, even ready two survey papers (I am a STEM PhD myself), but I wish knowing something could go hand in hand with feeling something.

HELP!

PS: Don't comment the cliche reddit comment ""break up"". I'll ignore. Give real solutions, how to deal with it. Does it go away with time?

PPS: Yes, we have little couple fights too, and I handle her during her periods. She gets jealous too, but there's not really much in my life for her to be jealous about anyway. Of course I haven't told her this in exactly these words, I don't want to demean her. All I'm saying is, we are a healthy couple, the perfect couple you can think of.

I feel like I waste my life on my days off and I want to change that.,"Disclaimer: For context, I'm a mid-twenties girlie with zero life responsibilities and dependents. There are absolutely no lasting consequences of me lying in bed all day, just the self-judgement that I'm wasting my life as a stupid form of rebellion. I therefore suspect this post may not apply to those with a house full of children who require feeding and watering and attention. Pre-kiddie advice still relevant though!

I've come to realise that my days off are completely wasted making the most of my ability to stay up late and then lie in. I tend to set my alarm for 9ish, but then snooze it for a while, and  eventually just lie in bed on my phone doing sweet F all. By the time I actually get up half the day is gone - I spend the little time I have left doing the stuff I'd been piling up whilst working (house cleaning, replying to emails, food shops, etc.), and then just to feel like I have some sort of 'free time' I usually make the foolish decision to stay up very late which only makes waking up early the next day even harder. I think a lot of this routine/behaviour is genuinely just a middle finger up to a work schedule and is just a dumb form of rebellion. 

It's not even like I struggle to get up at 6am on work days, so there's no reason for me to 'struggle' to get up on days off either. I have my work day morning routine down to a science. Awake and alert the second my alarm goes off, teeth, coffee, makeup, hair, breakfast, prep lunch, etc. It's autopilot and plays out identically each day down to the second. 

The fact that I find the routine of work days so easy makes me think that actually I just need to accept that I need to have a routine every day and finally retire my teenage-esque days of lying in and moping about like a hermit. I figured the best way to do that would be to just replicate my work day routine on my days off: get up at the same time, teeth, coffee, and so on... 

Is this what everyone who has their life together already does, and I'm just very late to the party? I wouldn't be surprised to find out I am the only person still rejecting adulthood at this age, so I am curious to know how others spend their days off. Is this overdue epiphany something everyone has already been doing? 

I'm kinda sick of wasting my days off so definitely need to change something, so any advice or whatever would be appreciated! Any tips or tricks you've found to help you not waste your days off? ",16,1763555447.0,doctorsUK,16,0.87,False
1p16fl8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelLinks/comments/1p16fl8/the_billionaires_bargain_bride/,The Billionaire's Bargain Bride,"My heart plummets.

My fists clench at my sides, nails biting into my palms as I stare, frozen, at the scene before me.

The room reeks of sweat and sex, I can’t help but tremble.

And there he is.

Dmitri.

My fiancé.

The man I was supposed to marry.

Groveling at my feet, tangled in his own damn pants as he fumbles to cover himself. His face is pale, his hair disheveled, his lips—those same lips that whispered loving words into my ears—swollen from kissing someone else.

A woman—a stranger—lays half-naked on the bed behind him, the silk sheets tangled around her body as she scrambles away like a cornered animal. Her eyes dart to mine in wide-eyed panic before she clutches the blanket to her chest and bolts toward the bathroom, slamming the door shut.

Coward.

Dmitri stares up at me, panic laced in his voice. ""Elena—it's not what it looks like.""

A hollow laugh escapes me. Cold. Emotionless. Clearly the laugh of a woman who has lost everything.

I take a step closer, my heels clicking against the polished hardwood floor. I feel detached from my own body, as if I'm watching this play out from somewhere far, far away.

""Not what it looks like?"" I repeat softly, tilting my head.

Dmitri, the man who once promised me forever, dares to feed me that cliché excuse.

A lump lodges in my throat, burning like acid.

""Dmitri,"" my voice is eerily calm, my hands trembling with suppressed rage, ""I just buried my father.""

His eyes flicker with guilt, but his lips part uselessly, searching for words.

""I came here because I—I needed you."" My voice cracks, raw with heartbreak. ""And I find you like this?""

I gesture to the bed—our bed—where another woman had just lain underneath him. The sheets I had picked out. The mattress we had chosen together. The room that was supposed to be ours.

Dmitri pushes to his feet, his pants still unbuttoned, his entire existence suddenly repulsive. He reaches for me. ""Please, I—""

""Don't touch me.""

My voice is sharper than I intend, but the thought of his hands on me now makes my skin crawl.

His face twists, desperation seeping into his features. ""It was a mistake! I wasn’t thinking—""

I scoff, my arms folding tightly over my chest. ""Oh? Your dick just happened to slip into her?""

Dmitri flinches. ""Elena—""

""Shut up.""

My breath is ragged. My vision blurs, but I refuse to cry. I refuse to break down in front of him.

I should be screaming. I should be throwing things, clawing at him, making him bleed the way he's just made me bleed. But I can't. I'm too numb.

Too shattered.

A part of me—a stupid, naive, pathetic part—wants him to fight for me.

To drop to his knees. To beg. To convince me that this isn’t real, that this is just some nightmare I’ll wake up from.

But I don't wake up.

I just stand there, breathing in the reality of it all.

""You said you loved me.""

Dmitri swallows hard. ""I do.""

My laugh is bitter. ""You have a funny way of showing it.""

Silence.

Maybe if this was the past me. Even the ‘me’ from yesterday, I would have screamed. I would have cursed him out. But now? I was already exhausted. Half my world had already shattered this morning.

So, instead, I inhale sharply and turn on my heel, my heart pounding against my ribs.

I need to leave.

Now.

""Elena, wait!"" Dmitri grabs my wrist, his grip desperate, but I rip myself free with such force that he stumbles back.

The love I had for him dies in that moment.

I don’t even look back as I walk away. Leaving our apartment. I walk in a daze, my mind completely lost to mourning my step-father, mourning the marriage life that I knew wouldn’t happen anymore.

My parent’s house is dark when I step inside.

The funeral was in the morning. It felt like a lifetime ago. And now, it’s night.

Everything feels different. Colder. Like the walls know what I’ve seen tonight, know that I am no longer the same woman who left this house earlier.

I swallow the lump in my throat and walk deeper inside, my heels clicking against the wooden floor.

""Mom?"" I call softly.

She must be sleeping. I had left her resting in her bedroom when I went to see Dmitri. God, I wish I hadn’t gone.

I wipe at my eyes, barely aware of the way my body shakes. The exhaustion crashes into me like a freight train.

One step. Then another.

I reach the kitchen, my fingers gripping the doorframe, ready to head upstairs—

Then I see her.

A choked gasp rips from my throat.

My mother.

She’s on the floor.

""Mom?"" My voice trembles.

She doesn’t move.

The room spins. My breath catches. No. No, no, no.

I stumble forward, collapsing onto my knees beside her. My hands shake violently as I reach for her, pressing my fingers to her neck, checking for breath, for warmth, for anything—

She’s burning.

Her skin is clammy, her forehead damp. And there—little red splotches marring her arm.

Burns.

What happened?

""Mom!"" I shake her. Hard. ""Mom, wake up! Please!""

She doesn’t stir.

The air leaves my lungs.

No. No. NO.

Please, God. Not her. Not her too.

My pulse roars in my ears, drowning everything else out as I grab my phone, my fingers fumbling, my vision blurring.

My heart slams against my ribs.

My throat tightens.

Tears blind me.

But there’s no time to panic.

I dial.

The ringing feels endless.

Then—

“911, what’s your emergency?”

I swallow a sob.

""My mother—she’s unconscious. Please. Please hurry.""

The operator starts talking, but I can barely hear.

I press my forehead to my mother’s, my body trembling.

“Stay with me,” I whisper. “Please, Mom. Stay with me.”

# Chapter 2

Elena’s POV:

The sterile white halls of the emergency ward felt like they were closing in on me, the scent of antiseptic and fear thick in the air.

My mother was wheeled in on a gurney, nurses shouting to each other in rushed, clipped voices as the emergency room doors swung open, then slammed shut, sealing her away from me.

I stood frozen in the hallway, my pulse a frantic drum against my ribs.

What do I do? What do I do?

My hands trembled as I pressed them to my face, trying to steady my breath, but it was impossible. She was fine this morning. Weak, but alive. And now she was in there, fighting for her life.

A nurse approached, her expression gentle. ""Miss Kovalyova?""

I turned, my throat too tight to respond.

""The doctor will speak with you shortly.""

I nodded numbly, my nails digging into my palms.

Minutes stretched into eternity. I had no idea how long I stood there, my body tense and aching.

Then the doors swung open again, and a doctor stepped out, his face strained.

I rushed forward. “Is she okay?”

The doctor exhaled. ""Your mother suffered a severe cardiac episode due to prolonged stress and underlying conditions. We need to perform an emergency bypass surgery to prevent further damage.""

My breath caught. ""Okay,"" I said, too quickly. ""Then do it.""

His face hardened. ""The procedure costs fifty eight thousand dollars here.""

The number hit me like a punch to the gut.

A sharp ringing filled my ears as my mind tried to process it. Fifty thousand dollars?!

I didn't have that kind of money.

Hell, I barely had enough to cover next month’s rent. We were already in deep shit with our previous debt.

""You'll need to secure the payment within the next twenty-four hours so we can proceed,"" the doctor continued, oblivious to the way my world was crumbling beneath my feet.

""Twenty-four hours?"" My voice came out hollow.

""Yes. If we delay any longer, her condition may worsen beyond what surgery can fix.""

I stared at him. Twenty-four hours. Fifty eight thousand dollars.

""Do you have insurance?"" the doctor asked, his voice impassive, like this was just another conversation for him.

""No."" My voice broke on the word.

""Family who can assist?""

I wanted to laugh. What family?

He sighed, pushing his glasses up his nose. ""I suggest you find a solution quickly. We will keep her stable for now, but time is of the essence."" With that, he nodded and disappeared down the hallway, leaving me standing in the wreckage of my life.

I stumbled backward onto one of the plastic chairs in the waiting area, my vision swimming.

I was alone.

There was no one I could call, no one I could ask.

And for one horrifying second, my mind drifted to Dmitri.

Dmitri Vetrov. My ex-fiancé.

Rich. Powerful. The youngest son of a multimillionaire. He could write a check for fifty thousand dollars without blinking.

Would he help me?

My stomach curled in disgust at the thought.

I could see it now. His smug, self-satisfied smirk. The condescending tilt of his head as he crossed his arms and leaned back, acting as if I owed him something for his generosity after how I had left him begging on his knees just a while ago.

No.

If my mother found out I had lowered myself to begging my cheating ex for money, she wouldn’t accept it. She would rather die than have me throw away my dignity for her.

And I wasn’t sure I could survive begging Dmitri either.

Then who?

My nails dug into my knees, my breath coming in short gasps. What do I do? What do I do?

And then—

A familiar name echoed from a nearby television.

I lifted my head.

The hospital’s mounted TV was tuned into a business channel, the news anchor’s voice crisp and professional.

“—Vetrov Enterprises, owned by billionaire Nikolai Vetrov, announced a record-breaking deal today—”

Nikolai Vetrov.

The camera shifted to a man in his mid-thirties, dressed in a sharp black suit, his jawline like it was carved from stone. His dark brown hair gelled back to perfection.

His cold, calculating dark eyes scanned the reporters, his smile hiding something dangerous.

The most eligible bachelor in the whole of Alderidge.

Nikolai Vetrov.

Dmitri’s older stepbrother.

And the man who hated Dmitri with every fiber of his being.

The memory surfaced before I could stop it.

Dmitri’s twenty-fifth birthday. Six months ago.

A lavish party was held in a massive ballroom, filled with people who definitely didn’t belong in my world. I was from a lower class family, attending college with a scholarship.

However, I had become Dmitri’s girlfriend and after four years, for the first time he had invited me to such an occasion. Introducing me to others like I was a trophy. I had actually been extremely happy that day.

Because that was also the day Dmitri had proposed to me.

I had just left the restroom, smoothing out my dress, when I nearly collided with Nikolai Vetrov.

He had been leaning against the hallway wall, one hand in his pocket, a cigarette between his fingers. His onyx brown eyes swept over me, slow and deliberate.

Then he exhaled, releasing a cloud of smoke. ""My condolences.""

I frowned. ""Excuse me?""

""Your mind is sharp,"" he murmured, voice low, slightly slurred from alcohol. ""But your taste in men is absolutely tragic.""

I had been dumbfounded.

Like, who says that about their own brother?

It was the first time I truly realized Nikolai didn’t just dislike Dmitri like a lot of siblings do. He despised him.

""You have such a smart little mind,"" he mused, ""but it’s wasted on a man like him.""

I scoffed. ""And what makes you say that?""

Nikolai took another drag from his cigarette, exhaling slowly as he looked out into the city through the massive floor to ceiling windows in front of us.

""He isn’t exactly husband material.""

I let out a sharp laugh. ""Oh? And what do you think makes a man husband material?"" It had truly been funny to me, that a ‘man’ was telling me what ‘husband material’ was supposed to be.

But I didn’t defend Dmitri, I noticed the venom in Nikolai’s tone and knew it would be useless. I didn’t want to pick a fight with someone like him either.

His gaze darkened, piercing straight into my soul.

""He sucks at cooking.""

My brows lifted. ""Seriously?""

""You laugh, but a man who can’t even take care of himself can’t take care of you either.""

I rolled my eyes. ""It’s fine. I can cook and I’m used to taking care of myself.""

Nikolai’s lips curved into a slow, knowing smirk.

""He’s shit with money. Spends it like water.""

""He’s rich. Why does it matter?""

His gaze sharpened. ""Are you marrying him for money, then?""

I met his stare and tilted my head. ""What if I am?"" Of course I wasn’t. I hadn’t taken a dime from Dmitri. Not that I was against being treated like a princess. I was just not used to being indebted to anyone like this, it made my skin itch.

However, instead of getting offended, Nikolai looked… satisfied. He straightened, flicking ash from his cigarette.

""Good,"" he said.

I frowned. That’s it?

He studied me for a long moment, then murmured, ""I’m richer than him, you know.""

I blinked.

""What does that have to do with me?""

Nikolai shrugged. Then he walked away.

Only later on had I realized what he meant when he had said the last line, but I had tossed it to the back of my mind and assumed he was testing me for his little brother.

That memory burned in my mind as I stared at his face on the TV screen.

Nikolai Vetrov was richer than Dmitri.

More powerful. More ruthless. And he hated his stepbrother.

I sucked in a sharp breath.

An idea began to take shape—insane, desperate, but my only option.

I needed money.

I wanted power.

And there was a man who had both.

I needed Nikolai Vetrov.

# Chapter 3

Elena’s POV:

If I was wrong about Nikolai Vetrov’s intentions, the worst that could happen was that I would embarrass myself. That was nothing compared to what was at stake. But if I didn’t do anything—if I didn’t at least try to ask for his help—and my mother’s condition worsened, or worse…

I knew I would regret it for the rest of my life.

I exhaled sharply, forcing my shaky legs to push me upright.

That’s it then.

I had made my choice.

Pulling out my phone, I searched for the address of Vetrov Enterprises. I had been there once or twice before, back when Dmitri would take me out for lunch at one of the high-end restaurants near his brother’s office. But I didn’t remember the exact address.

At least I knew Nikolai wasn’t out of the country.

I glanced down at my outfit—a simple black dress, the same one I had worn earlier at my dad’s funeral. My hair was still tied into a low bun, strands falling loose from hours of exhaustion.

I looked like a grieving woman.

Which, in many ways, I was.

I was mourning the death of my father, the life I thought I would have, the man I thought loved me and the security I had believed in.

Now, I had nothing.

Except for this one insane, desperate plan.

— 30 minutes later —

The towering glass building of Vetrov Enterprises loomed before me, its sharp edges piercing the dawn sky.

The city was still asleep, the streets nearly deserted, but this place—this empire Nikolai built with his own hands—was already awake at four o'clock in the morning.

A few luxury cars lined the private parking area, their sleek exteriors gleaming under the streetlights.

I inhaled deeply, steeling myself.

I knew I probably wouldn’t be able to see him right away. CEOs don’t stroll into work at four in the morning. But I had no choice. I would leave my number with the receptionist and pray that Nikolai would agree to meet me.

There was no way I could ask Dmitri for his brother’s number.

Not when I was about to do this.

I pushed through the heavy glass doors and stepped into the lobby.

The receptionist at the front desk—a well-dressed woman in her late twenties— looked up from her computer screen, her eyes widening in surprise when she saw me.

“Are you Miss Elena?”

I frowned. “You know me?”

She hesitated, then nodded. “Ah, yes. Sir told me to send you up.”

My heart stopped.

What?

I stared at her, my pulse hammering in my ears. Had he… anticipated my arrival?

No. That wasn’t possible.

How would he know?

My hands curled into fists, my heartbeat racing.

The receptionist smiled and handed me a key card. “Take the elevator to the twenty-seventh floor. He’s expecting you.”

I nodded slowly, forcing myself to act normal as I took the card and walked toward the elevator.

My mind was spiraling.

Was this just a coincidence? Had he expected me to come?

Or… had he known all along that this day would come? No…that didn’t make sense. How would he know that I needed money for my mother’s bypass in advance?

There was another more plausible reason that swirled in my mind…was he somehow stalking me?

I swallowed hard, shaking off the thought as I stepped into the empty elevator.

That was ridiculous though. Why would someone like him have a need to do that?

The moment the doors slid shut, I let out a shaky breath and pressed my back against the cold metal wall.

Calm down. Keep it together.

I tapped the key card against the panel. The elevator hummed to life, carrying me higher and higher.

Maybe it was just my imagination or nervousness but the air felt thinner the closer I got.

Twenty-fifth floor.

Twenty-sixth.

Twenty-seventh.

A soft chime echoed, and the doors glided open.

There was only one office here.

A massive, double-door entrance at the end of the dimly lit hallway.

And sitting just outside it, a man—his posture straight as he typed away at his laptop. Nikolai’s secretary?

As soon as he saw me, he stood up and gestured toward the doors.

“Sir is waiting for you, Miss Kovalyova.” He smiled and moved to open the door for me.

I nodded, thanking him as I stepped inside, my gaze immediately landing on the man behind the desk.

Nikolai Vetrov sat in his massive leather chair, flipping through a file as if he hadn’t just called me here before I even made the decision to come.

His dark eyes flicked up from his papers, locking onto me.

The man was unfairly attractive.

He looked unbothered, composed. His expensive suit was perfectly fitted, the top button of his shirt undone, revealing a glimpse of tattoos peeking from his collar.

The picture-perfect CEO.

And I was standing frozen in front of him.

“Good morning,” he said smoothly, his voice deep.

The last time we had talked, I had drank alcohol so it hadn’t felt like this, and before that, the couple of times we ran into each other we hadn’t conversed at all.

I took a breath, forcing down my nerves. “Morning.”

“Have a seat.”

I did, trying to keep my posture straight and confident despite the storm raging inside me.

“Tea or coffee?” he asked.

“Neither. I’m fine.”

Nikolai frowned slightly before picking up the telecom. “Send in a pumpkin spice latte.”

My body went rigid.

How… did he know my favorite drink?

He leaned back, watching me with something close to amusement. ""Don't think too much. Dmitri talks a lot about you.""

My stomach tightened.

Hearing my ex-fiancé’s name out loud felt like a punch to the ribs. But I refused to show it.

Instead, I kept my gaze trained on Nikolai. “You know what he did, don’t you?”

He smirked.

""I warned you, didn't I? He isn't husband material.""

I clenched my fists ignoring his remark for now. “Why do you hate Dmitri?”

His smirk didn’t fade. ""Hate? No, I don't hate him. But I dislike him.""

I narrowed my eyes.

""He's spoiled. Daddy’s little treasure. He’s never suffered a day in his life. Never had to fight for anything. He thinks with his head, but not the one on his shoulders.""

Nikolai motioned toward his crotch.

I bit down on my tongue, feeling the urge to refute him.

But could I?

I had seen it with my own two eyes.

Dmitri was exactly what Nikolai described.

""After all,"" Nikolai continued, ""if he had any brains, he wouldn’t have fumbled someone like you.""

A sharp, hot sensation crawled up my spine.

This was it. This was my opening.

I lifted my chin. ""I have an offer for you.""

His eyes flickered with interest.

""Marry me. Give me enough money to save my mother. In return, I’ll give you a wife on paper. And a way to make your little brother a laughing stock.""

For the first time, Nikolai froze.

I watched as he leaned back, studying me. Then, his lips curled.

""You're pretty straightforward. I expected you to take more time to come around.""

My fingers dug into my lap. “I don’t have time for that. My mother needs emergency Bypass surgery. Are you willing to help me or not?”

I was probably glaring at him now.

A moment of silence stretched between us.

Then—

""If I say no… will you go back and ask Dmitri for money?""

A wry smile spread across my face.

“He isn’t the only member of the Vetrov family I can go to, you know,” I said, my voice laced with something dangerous. “After all, I know Daddy Vetrov has certain tendencies toward girls half his age.”

I was pushing my limits.

But I had a hunch.

A dangerous, reckless hunch.

That Nikolai Vetrov was interested in me.

# Chapter 4

Elena’s POV:

As expected, Nikolai Vetrov went rigid.

His sharp, composed expression didn’t falter, but something in his posture shifted. His dark eyes locked onto mine, piercing, calculating—assessing me.

Then, he stood up. Slowly.

“You really are something, you know that?” His voice was smooth, almost amused, but there was an underlying challenge in his tone.

“Fine then.” He leaned against his desk, arms crossed. “But tell me, Elena—what else are you willing to give? Because making Dmitri a laughingstock? That’s not difficult for me.”

He smirked. “I could do that without marrying you.”

He was right. He truly didn’t need me for that.

But I needed him.

My wedding with Dmitri was set for three months from now. If I didn’t get married, I would be the one people laughed at. My friends, my classmates, the very people who had seen me flaunt my relationship on social media for years.

The image of Dmitri’s betrayal and his pathetic excuses burned in my mind.

My stomach twisted. I wanted him to suffer.

That’s when I realized—this wasn’t just about saving my mother. If I only needed money for that I could just borrow it from him. Not just him, I could go back to the loan sharks and take more money from them.

They wouldn’t decline me, in fact they would only be happy to see me paying back my debts for the rest of my life.

So yes, I wanted to destroy Dmitri.

I wanted to rip him apart from the inside.

Make him feel even a fraction of what I had felt when I walked in on him with someone else.

I inhaled deeply, staring at Nikolai.

If he wasn’t going to marry me, he was useless to me.

“I’ll give you a wife on paper and nothing more,” I said firmly. “I have nothing else to give.”

That was the truth…or so I thought.

Silence stretched between us.

Then Nikolai got up, his movements slow, deliberate.

His eyes narrowed as he approached, his steps measured, predatory. The air between us grew heavy, thick with an intensity I wasn’t prepared for.

I forced my body to stay still, my heart pounding loudly in my chest.

After what felt like an eternity, he finally spoke.

""You want to marry me and have my name, Elena?""

His breath grazed my ear, sending an involuntary shiver down my spine.

""Then you’ll take everything that comes with it.""

My eyes widened slightly. “What… do you mean?”

He smiled, his fingers gripping the arms of my chair as he turned it to face him completely.

Our noses almost touched. Our breaths almost intertwined.

""Everything,"" he murmured. ""My money. My fame. And even my body.""

My breath hitched.

But I shook my head. No. No, I couldn’t do that.

“I want a strictly contractual marriage. With a time limit,” I said, my voice steady, but my hands clenched into fists.

His lips curled into a smirk. ""And a contract marriage is what you’ll get. No feelings. No strings attached. One year.”

I narrowed my eyes, “I won’t sleep with you.” I truly didn’t trust myself around a man like him. If I actually slept with him, what if I developed feelings? No…not again. Especially not a Vetrov.

His next words however knocked the air right out of my lungs.

""Oh, no, I need you to understand this, Malishka. There will be no sleeping. Only fucking.""

My entire body stiffened.

He leaned closer, his voice smooth, teasing. ""I will fuck you. If you can accept that… then I will make sure Dmitri grovels at your feet. I’ll ensure your mother’s surgery is done by the world’s best surgeon.

He straightened, studying my reaction before he delivered the final blow.

""And I’ll make sure you never have to work a part-time job again. You’ll have all the time in the world to study—to build your dream of making cars.""

My pulse thundered.

He listed everything I needed. Everything I ever wanted.

If my mother fully recovered, she wouldn’t be upset with this decision. I could focus on my studies. Graduate without worrying about money.

And all I had to do… was give myself to a man built like a Greek god?

What other choice did I have? The loan sharks? Dmitri? Any other rich old guy, someone way worse than Nikolai?

It would be stupid to decline.

But my body was frozen.

My mind was racing.

Could I really do this? Could I really sell my body to this man for a year?

I bit my lip, his unwavering stare making my heart pound.

After what felt like forever, I inhaled deeply, forcing my thoughts to clear.

Finally, I met his gaze head-on.

""Fine. I accept your conditions.""

I squared my shoulders. ""But if you go back on your word, Nikolai—I will ruin you.""

I didn’t know how I would do it.

But I would find a way.

I believed in myself.

…At least, in my follicular phase.

Nikolai chuckled, his smirk widening.

""You have my permission to do so.""

Finally, he pulled away, straightening his suit as he glanced at his watch. Then, his gaze flickered back to me.

""Shall we go then?""

I frowned. “Go where?”

“Well, there’s much to be done if we’re getting married today.”

My eyes widened. ""You mean… right now? Today?!""

He smirked. ""You know what they say, malishka. The early bird—”

“I need to go to the hospital,” I cut his nonsense off.

His smirk faded.

I took a deep breath. ""I need to be with my mom. I can’t just leave her like this.""

He sighed, studying me for a long moment.

""Are you going to perform the surgery?""

I blinked. ""What?""

""No?"" He raised an eyebrow. ""Then why do you need to be there?""

I clenched my jaw. ""Because she’s my mother. I’m her only immediate family. I need to be there for her.""

Nikolai rubbed his temple, exhaling sharply. “Fine. We’ll take care of her first. Give me a moment.”

Then, right in front of me, he pulled out his phone, dialed a number, and put it on speaker.

""Prepare the operating room,"" he ordered.

My breath caught.

There was a pause, then a voice responded. ""Sir?""

""I'm sending you a patient. Her name is Beatrix Kovalyova. Make sure you’re prepared to perform a bypass procedure. You are to treat her as a V.I.P patient. Nothing but the best.""

I stared at him, stunned.

The person on the line hesitated, then cleared their throat.

""Understood, sir. May I ask who the patient is to you?""

Nikolai's gaze flickered to me.

Then, smoothly, he said, ""My mother-in-law.""

My breath hitched.

The doctor on the line hesitated—then let out a soft chuckle.

""Congratulations on the marriage, Mr. Vetrov.""

Nikolai smiled. ""Thank you.""

I looked at him, completely dumbfounded.

What.

The.

Hell?

# Chapter 5

Elena’s POV:

Nikolai buttoned his lapel with a smooth, practiced motion and strode toward the door. His movements were always so smooth, always composed, as if the world bent to his command without question.

I hurried to follow him, my heels clicking softly against the marble floor. ""Where are you going?""

He barely glanced at me as he pressed the elevator button. ""You wanted to see your mother, didn’t you?""

I blinked, nodding. ""Yes, but—"" My brows furrowed. ""You’re coming with me? Don’t you have work?""

I cast a glance back at his secretary, who immediately looked away as if pretending not to eavesdrop.

Nikolai smirked as the elevator doors slid open. ""You know,"" he mused, stepping inside and waiting for me to follow, ""there’s something my late mother used to say. Family always comes first.""

I hesitated before stepping in, standing a careful distance from him.

Family.

That word sat uncomfortably in my chest.

Because everyone knew the story of the Vetrov family scandal—how Andrey Vetrov, one of the richest men in Alderidge, had cheated on his wife and brought home a pregnant mistress—Dmitri’s mother. Though that was decades ago.

I gave him a sideways glance, unsure how to respond.

As if sensing my thoughts, he continued, ""Not that it helped her much. After all, her choice in men was just as bad as yours.""

My lips twitched. ""Well, I’m marrying you now, aren’t I?""

He turned his head and gave me a look. The kind that made me feel positively stupid.

""Who said I was a good choice?"" he murmured.

I grinned. ""Do you know how to cook?"" I asked, remembering his remarks back at the birthday party.

He raised a brow, clearly surprised by the question. ""Of course I do. I’m not incompetent.""

""Do you manage your money well?""

He scoffed. ""Would I be a billionaire if I didn’t?""

""That doesn’t make you a good man?""

A smirk tugged at the corner of his lips. ""No, it doesn’t.""

I huffed, crossing my arms. ""Well, on the bright side, you're only going to be my husband for one year, right? So it doesn’t really matter to me whether you’re a good man or not.""

From the corner of my eye, I saw him tilt his head slightly, his gaze lingering on me for a second longer than necessary.

Then he exhaled a quiet, almost amused, ""Right.""

The Next Few Hours Felt Like a Storm.

Nikolai didn’t talk much. He only did.

His presence alone moved things faster than I could have ever imagined.

The medical fees? Paid immediately.

The transfer to the most elite hospital in the city? Handled without a single complication.

The moment the new surgeon arrived, he greeted me with a professional nod and a calm reassurance, ""Rest assured, Mrs. Vetrov. I will do my very best for your mother.""

I exhaled slowly, my chest loosening for the first time in what felt like ages.

The relief was overwhelming.

Then, as the surgeon disappeared behind the doors of the operating room, something inside me cracked.

The view was so familiar. One that I had witnessed only a couple days ago. When Dad got into an accident. But he never made it out alive.

George Anderson had been a foreigner, a tourist visiting Velhaven City when he met my mother thirteen years ago. And in just a year, they had married.

He was the best father I could have ever asked for.

I had been lucky—so incredibly lucky.

When I was six, I was adopted by Beatrix Kovalyova after years in an orphanage that I barely remembered. My memories of that place had become hazy over time, like a bad dream I had long since tried to forget.

But Mom and Dad?

They were my reality. My safe haven.

And now—

Now I was alone.

For the first time in my life after six, neither of them were beside me.

The reality of it hit me hard.

I was twenty-five. Not a child. Not young anymore. More than an adult.

But I didn’t feel like one.

I still felt small, still felt like a little girl reaching out for her mother’s hand.

Please be okay, Mom.

I didn't think I’d survive if she didn’t.

I tried to push the thought away, but it settled in my chest like a weight I couldn't shake.

Then—

A deep voice cut through my spiraling thoughts.

""She’ll be okay. Don’t worry.""

I blinked, glancing to my side.

Nikolai was sitting next to me, his expression solemn for the first time ever.

I exhaled slowly, straightening my back. ""Let’s sign the contract tonight."" My voice was quieter than I intended. ""We can hold an official wedding later if you want."" After all, I owed it to him after he just paid all the bills.

Not to mention that this surgeon would probably charge more than just fifty eight thousand.

He nodded, his gaze still fixed ahead. ""Alright. That works for me.""

""You should leave,"" I murmured. ""I’ll come to your office by the evening.""

He raised a brow. ""Trying to get rid of me?""

I sighed. ""I just need time to ask for a few days of extra leave from college. I also need to call my manager and let her know I won’t be covering my shifts tomorrow.""",1,1763555445.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False
1p16en7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BalaAI/comments/1p16en7/want_to_know_purpose_of_life/,want to know purpose of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1p1676k,https://www.reddit.com/r/eggfreezing/comments/1p1676k/my_egg_freezing_experience/,My egg freezing experience,"Completed my first round of egg freezing and wanted to share my experience, this community helped me throughout the process so I’d like to share what it was like for me!

Baseline stats were AMH 9.3pmol/l and AFC 19, and I turned 35 in September so I started the treatment when I was 35 and 1 month old. I was disappointed by my AFC because when I had my first scan in August I had 24 resting follicles, but I was told by the nurse that 19 was a good number for my age. 

I took 300 Gonal F for 12 days, ganirelix for 6 days and then buserelin trigger. I stimmed for 12 days in total. 

Experience:

Overall I found the entire experience very manageable with minimal side effects. I did not have any mood swings and barely any pain. Initially, I felt very out of it and confused and I made a lot of mistakes and forgot things, I felt vulnerable being out and about by myself because I at times forgot where I was and found it hard to concentrate. Im not someone who usually feels like this so it was a weird experience for me! But I got used to it and the injections got easier as the time went on and these symptoms reduced a lot. Administering the injections themselves were very easy. This is something I had worried about before but after the first injection it was alright. 

Response to meds:

My response to the meds was both good and not so good. Of my 19 follicles, 18 grew in response to the medication, which I was told was great. The growth started fast though, and then it slowed down and plateaud. By day 10 they said I had to come in for an additional scan as they thought I might need to stim for longer. However, on day 11 & 12 I had a lot of rapid growth and my largest follicle went from 15mm to 25mm in two days. There were 4 which stayed at 6mm but the nurse said that all the others were in the running for retrieval. Over that weekend, I had a lot of breast pain and I wanted to stay in bed and rest, which I did, and it helped. I made sure to eat more food than I normally would and to make sure I was getting lots of healthy fats and protein, as this made me feel better. 

Procedure:

I was really nervous during the egg collection procedure, however the nurses were really supportive and helped me to feel a bit calmer. The anaesthetist explained the process of sedation and once he gave me the medication I soon felt really drowsy and I fell asleep after about 20 seconds. The medicine tasted like butterscotch lol. I woke up and didn’t know where I was or what was happening and I had to ask the team what was going on and where I was. I had bled onto the chair and I felt pain like period cramps. I went back to my room and I drank water, had biscuits and a coffee, then I went to the toilet and could pee a bit. I quite quickly regained my consciousness and the drowsiness subsided and I could leave to wait for my mum to pick me up from the waiting room. 

Eggs retrieved:

Disappointingly the doctor only retrieved 7 eggs. I was upset and tearful at this when she told me and I had hoped I would get around 10 due to the size of my follicles. However, of those 7 eggs retrieved, 6 were mature, which I am really pleased about because they said about 60-70% of eggs tend to be mature. Given my fairly low AMH, I was anticipating having to do two rounds, but had hoped I wouldn’t need to given my quite decent AFC. My plan is to enjoy my Christmas and reevaluate in the new year and make plans for a second round, if I want to, after some time has passed. 

Overall, the experience has been really positive and easy for me. I would feel comfortable doing it again and the only thing holding me back a bit is the cost, though I am in a lucky position to  be able to pay for it as I have some savings. I was lucky that my mum paid for this round for me and I count myself lucky that I have the freedom of choice to do it twice. My clinic says that with 6 mature eggs I have around a 45% chance of a baby. 

I would encourage anyone considering egg freezing not to be dissuaded by the difficult experiences that some women have with the procedure. It feels as though it really varies person to person, but my worries about the process before didn’t turn out to be reality for me.

I'm so confused by the color to pick as the primary color for the kitchen cabinets and need some help so I'm not clashing with the floors - looking for a white/greige to pull from the coolness of the floors in the Benjamin Moore line. I currently picked Swiss coffee, but am now overthinking the decision becuase I'm concerned it will be too warm with the floors. 

I've also included a shot of the quartz we have picked out, which will extend up the wall. The paint chips sitting on the quartz are Swiss Coffee and Chantilly Lace - the current front-runner for the walls (again I think this might be too harsh for the house- but open to opinions)

Chapter 1

After the divorce, I left Las Vegas without a moment's hesitation.

I headed to Dubai alone, ready to start anew.

Over time, I carved out a name for myself in the shadowy world of Middle Eastern arms dealing.

Then, whispers from Las Vegas reached me: my ex-husband, Augustine Clayton, was about to get engaged to his little mistress.

I ran my fingers over the bullet pendant around my neck.

Eight years ago, during a brutal gang shootout, he'd taken that bullet for me. It had grazed perilously close to his heart, missing by a hair's breadth.

Once the surgeons pulled it out, he fashioned it into a necklace and slipped it around my neck.

His voice was soft, almost tender, as he whispered, ""From now on, my life is yours.""

Snapping back to the present, I yanked the chain off without a second thought and tossed it into the trash.

Back then, everyone sneered that I was just some prize Augustine had won at the casino tables—that without him, I'd be nothing.

Seven years later, I returned to Las Vegas to open a new mine.

At the negotiation table, Augustine, who ruled half the city, locked eyes with me, and in that instant, tears welled up in his eyes.

I, however, remembered what had happened at his father's funeral seven years earlier.

That day, he stood shoulder-to-shoulder with his mistress, letting her play the part of his wife, graciously accepting condolences from family and friends.

That day, I learned my husband had built a cozy little home with her in Centennial Hills.

I slid the divorce papers across the table to Augustine, calm and collected as ever.

""Sign them.""

Augustine arched an eyebrow, his expression dripping with amusement.

Tucked beneath the agreement was a newspaper, sensationalized to the hilt, detailing how Augustine's lover, Cecilia Webster, had stolen the spotlight at the funeral, leaving his real wife humiliated and sidelined.

""Kassandra, must you play these childish games again?"" he asked casually.

""For eight years, you've dangled divorce over my head like a threat—must be at least a hundred times by now. Haven't you gotten tired of this routine?""

Then he fished a black card out of his pocket and flicked it onto the table.

""If that's not enough, just hit up Brad—he'll wire you more. I've been swamped with work lately, but you can call me if you need anything.""

I didn't take the card. I simply cast a cool glance at Cecilia in his arms.

All the women Augustine had paraded around these years looked just like her.

I knew exactly why Augustine never married Cecilia after she came back.

After all, the wife of the underground king wasn't meant for the one he loved—it was for the one who fit the role, the strategic choice.

""You planning to keep her as your side piece forever?""

I nudged the divorce papers forward again.

Cecilia pouted in annoyance, clearly stung by the ""side piece"" label. She cooed in that saccharine voice of hers, ""Ms. Lambert, love's between two people. The one who's not loved is the real side piece.""

Augustine chuckled lightly, saying nothing to contradict her.

He stroked her cheek affectionately, then turned to me. ""We'll go to the church tomorrow morning. Don't be late.""

I didn't look away until his figure faded.

Every week, Augustine dragged me to church, saying it would cleanse us of our sins.

His mother, Shelly Clayton, often hinted that my barren womb was proof of my sin.

And Augustine? He saw my intolerance for his mistresses as the sin of jealousy.

Stepping into the church, I closed my eyes and began to pray.

When Augustine arrived, an inexplicable wave of panic gripped my heart.

""Kassandra,"" he called out.

My pulse quickened, a knot tightening in my chest.

""A sorcerer told me Cecilia's in for some bad luck this year. The only way to ward it off is to soak her feet in water mixed with your father's ashes.""

I shot to my feet, staring into his cold, impassive eyes in utter shock—then burst into a hollow laugh.

""Augustine, eight years ago, I consulted a fortune teller about us. I lied and said we were a perfect match, but the truth? He told me you will ruin my life, and we will never have a baby.

""If you so much as touch my father's grave, I'll smash your father's coffin to splinters.""

Over the years, I'd cried and raged over his endless affairs.

I'd learned the hard way: in this cutthroat jungle, no man respected a woman who endured everything without fighting back.

His face darkened in an instant.

""Do it!"" he ordered, his voice stern, brooking no dissent.

""Augustine!""

His henchmen pinned me down with iron grips, while the others desecrated my father's grave right before my eyes.

""Kassandra, this is for your father's own good. Ashes are useless. Helping Cecilia out? It's an honor for him.""

""Get the hell off me!""

Fueled by the absurdity of it all, I lashed out, shoving his goons aside and snatching the urn back.

Then, a brutal blow cracked against the back of my head.

Warm blood trickled down my forehead, blurring my vision.

I couldn't hold onto the urn anymore. Soon, someone ripped it from my arms.

In agony, I raised my head and, under the harsh sun, saw Augustine's cold face.

""Deliver it to the sorcerer,"" he said.

I forced a bitter smile and then blacked out.

Chapter 2

When I came to, I was in a hospital bed.

My loyal aide filled me in: Augustine had spent the last few days in Centennial Hills with Cecilia.

He had used my father's ashes for some twisted black magic ritual, trying to bind my dad's spirit, forcing his ghost to serve Cecilia like some obedient phantom.

I yanked out the IV needle, gathered a squad of men I'd trained, and went straight there.

Cecilia was lounging on the sofa, sipping coffee, her face draining of color when she saw me burst through the door.

I scanned the opulent villa and found a brand-new altar in the corner.

There, staring back at me, was my father's portrait.

The sight ignited an inferno of rage inside me, flames licking at my veins.

""Kassandra, you're not welcome here! If you try anything, I'll make sure Augustine...""

Before she could finish her threat, I lunged, grabbing a fistful of her hair and yanking her toward the altar.

""Looks like you still don't get it.

""I'm Augustine's real wife. Every damn penny from his arms empire? Half of it's mine! If I want you out of here, you won't last an hour.""

I stamped on her wrist with my combat boot, grinding down hard.

Cecilia let out a piercing shriek, agony ripping through her.

""You... you old hag! Augustine will never let you get away with this!""

I sneered, tightening my grip on her hair and slamming her face into the floor.

""You think you can stay young forever? In this world, youth is the cheapest commodity.

""You wanted my dad's ashes to break your curse? Foot-soaking's not enough. Here—drink every last drop of that filthy water!""

I signaled my men to hold her down, then poured the basin of ash-tainted water straight down her throat.

For every spill, I slapped her hard across the face.

By the time I let go, her cheeks were swollen, her lips bloodied.

Suddenly, urgent footsteps echoed behind us.

Augustine arrived, radiating an arctic chill, his private army following close behind, all weapons drawn and ready.

""Kassandra, you've crossed the line.""

His voice was a frozen blade as he bent down and scooped up the limp woman in his arms.

I met his glare head-on. ""Mr. Clayton, compared to what you've done, this is nothing.""

His eyes blazed with arctic rage.

""Throw her into the snake pit out back. No one pulls her out without my order.""

It was the venomous viper den he'd excavated just to indulge Cecilia's twisted whims.

""You wanted to watch an execution, right? Today, you'll get your fill,"" he murmured tenderly to the woman in his embrace.

Two burly guards dragged me roughly toward the rear of the property.

In the chilling depths of the cavern, serpents slithered forth, fangs sinking into my flesh with searing venom.

Agony exploded through me, blood soaking my clothes in a warm, sticky flood.

Before oblivion claimed me, I caught Cecilia's triumphant cackle.

I twisted my lips into a silent, sardonic smile.

Eight years ago, in front of all the crime lords, Augustine had sworn he'd only ever want me.

But his heart and his vows? They'd soured in just eight short years.

I spent two weeks in the hospital, nursing my wounds back to health.

During that time, the scandal exploded across Las Vegas: Augustine Clayton, pampering his mistress while letting his own wife bleed out in a snake pit. The whole city was buzzing.

On the day I was discharged, I made good on my promise—I shattered Augustine's father's coffin to pieces.

After venting my fury, I went to see Shelly.

""Shelly,"" I said, stepping into the room.

She opened her eyes, her gaze a tangled mix of pity and resignation.

""Could you pass this divorce agreement to Augustine for me?"" I handed over the papers, along with the newspaper that described my humiliating story.

""Kassandra, men are all the same. You need to wise up. Compared to power and money, love's just a fleeting illusion.

""Only when you stop letting a man control your heart do you truly come out on top.""

The destruction of her husband's coffin didn't faze her in the least.

In their youth, Augustine's father had chased countless mistresses and left a string of illegitimate children. She'd long since lost any illusions about him.

""Shelly, I married Augustine not because he was some rich heir, but because he was Augustine.""

It was love at first sight. Back in the boxing ring, covered in blood, his eyes fierce and unyielding—that image had pierced straight through my soul.

These eight years, leveraging the Clayton family's influence to build arms channels and a network of my own. I was no longer the vulnerable girl who needed his protection.

I'd stayed by his side only because I couldn't let go of that love, even as it rotted away.

""Once you're divorced, his mistresses will trample all over you,"" Shelly said.

I smiled. ""If she's got what it takes, let her try to climb.""

Chapter 3

When it came to Augustine's mistress, I felt nothing.

I knew Cecilia wasn't much of a threat.

A woman like her could only rely on her looks, and no true arms dealer would ever marry a woman who had nothing but a pretty face to offer.

Shelly stayed silent for a long time before finally ordering the maid to take away the divorce papers and the newspaper.

She stared at me for a while, then sighed. ""You know, there are countless women who would kill to be in your position.""

I didn't respond, just offered her a slight, respectful bow, and turned to leave.

Everyone envied me for standing at the pinnacle of power in Las Vegas, but only I knew what it truly cost.

My marriage with Augustine was like a field of poppies—beautiful on the surface but poisonous at its core.

As I stepped out, I ran into Augustine's cousin, Felicia Clayton.

""I thought you'd tolerate him for the rest of your life,"" she said dryly.

""I used to think so too,"" I replied with a faint smile.

She smirked. ""I'll admit, I never really liked you. But between you and that tramp from the red-light district in Mexico, I'd pick you any day.""

""You've been with him for eight years,"" she continued, folding her arms. ""You're really just going to walk away? Don't you feel it's a waste? You could still cash out.""

I chuckled. ""If I stay any longer, I might not make it out alive. What good is his money if I'm dead?""

Felicia burst out laughing. ""Relax. Good men are everywhere! After the divorce, I'll introduce you to someone—better than Augustine, richer than Augustine, and probably more of a gentleman too.""

That evening, Shelly's maid brought me the signed divorce papers.

I immediately sent them to the courthouse to finalize the process. Then, finally allowing myself to relax, I drew a hot bath.

Just as I was sinking into the water with a glass of red wine, the door burst open. Augustine stumbled in, reeking of alcohol.

He braced his arms on the edge of the tub, trapping me between them, his voice low and lazy. ""Good evening, darling.""

My hand froze midair.

I realized then that Shelly must've tricked him into signing those papers. He clearly had no idea what he'd signed.

Otherwise, he wouldn't still be calling me ""darling.""

I stood, wrapping a robe around myself, and pushed him away coldly.

""Still throwing tantrums?"" he asked, grabbing my wrist. ""Cecilia's nothing. It's over.""

I caught sight of the lipstick smudged on his collar and wrenched my hand free.

""It's not a tantrum. It's disgusting.

""Your taste, Augustine, is as cheap as the perfume Cecilia drowns herself in. It's revolting.""

The next day, for the first time, we didn't attend the Las Vegas jewelry auction together.

Augustine showed up with Cecilia on his arm, stealing the spotlight the moment they walked in.

When I entered the hall, I overheard him introducing Cecilia to the investors as his woman.

Someone spotted me and greeted, ""Mrs. Clayton!""

""Well, if it isn't Mrs. Clayton,"" Cecilia mocked, her tone sugary and cruel. ""That dress looks a little... modest for the occasion, doesn't it?""

I lifted my hand slightly, revealing the emerald ring that symbolized my status as Augustine's wife. ""What I wear doesn't matter,"" I said coolly. ""What matters is that everyone here knows exactly who Mrs. Clayton is.

""Men like to have their fun sometimes. Ms. Webster, not everyone has your... devotion—content to be a mistress for life.""

Onstage, the host invited Augustine and his wife to unveil the centerpiece.

Augustine extended his hand toward me. ""Come on. Don't keep them waiting.""

His intent was obvious—to give me an easy way down and to show the world our marriage was still unshaken.

We unveiled the piece together and delivered our speeches—every move was flawless, every word in perfect harmony.

The soft golden lights traced the angles of his face, so familiar yet so distant.

The warm stage lights traced the mature lines of his profile, and for a moment, I was transported back eight years, to when we had first taken over a smuggling route together.

That night, after securing our first million-dollar deal, he had slipped this very ring onto my finger aboard a yacht.

I smiled and whispered, ""Mr. Clayton, what a wild ride through blood and flames.""

But the human heart, I realized, was far more unpredictable than any gamble in Las Vegas.

Chapter 4

I excused myself from the crowd, claiming I needed some air, and stepped out onto the terrace.

Cecilia followed me out, her heels clicking sharply against the marble.

""Ms. Lambert,"" she called, voice dripping with challenge.

I turned, regarding her with cool detachment.

""Four years ago, the night you had your miscarriage, Augustine told you he was away on business,"" she spat, aiming to twist the knife. ""He was actually in my bed.""

I took a slow drag of my cigarette, exhaled, and met her gaze, calm as ever.

""I thought you'd have learned some tact by now,"" I said quietly.

Her eyes flashed. ""He loves me. He said he'd divorce you and marry me. He promised I'd have everything.""

I laughed. The sound came out low, amused, and almost pitying.

""He said that in bed, didn't he? That's his favorite place to make promises.""

I flicked ash off my cigarette. ""Every woman who's come to me has said the same thing. Tell me, what makes you any different?""

I stubbed out the cigarette and turned to leave.

But as I brushed past, she suddenly grabbed my wrist. ""The first time I stepped into his house, I knew you were just lucky,"" she spat. ""You and I came from the same dirt. Why you? Why did you get to be his wife?

""I'm younger. I'm prettier. I should've been the one!""

Her voice shook with anger and envy. ""Please, just divorce him! Let him go!""

I frowned and started to pull away. But suddenly, a deafening crash exploded from below.

The floor shuddered violently, and the terrace rail groaned and began to split.

By the time Augustine and his men rushed in, the terrace had cracked in two. Cecilia and I were stranded on opposite sides, the structure crumbling beneath us.

""Mr. Clayton, the structure won't hold!"" one of his men shouted. ""You've gotta save one first!""

A second collapse could hit any second; whoever got left behind was as good as dead.

Cecilia screamed, sobbing hysterically. My knuckles were white against the ledge.

""Augustine!"" I cried. ""The night I lost our baby—you swore you'd never hurt me again!""

It was all I had left to bargain with. Even if love was gone, maybe his guilt wasn't.

Augustine's lips pressed into a thin line, his eyes darting in tortured hesitation.

Then Cecilia shrieked, ""Augustine! I'm pregnant with your child!""

His eyes widened. And in that instant, I knew.

""Save Cecilia first!"" he shouted.

I watched as they pulled her to safety, her tears shining in the chaos.

Then the stone beneath my hands gave way.

Weightlessness hit me like a punch—I plummeted downward, eyes squeezing shut in resignation.

I got it. Cecilia had his child growing inside her; I was just yesterday's flame. How could I compete?

Luck—or irony—saved me.

I crashed into a canopy, which broke my fall.

After a day and night lost to unconsciousness, the rescue team found me.

When I awoke, the media frenzy was in full swing.

The title read, ""Las Vegas Collapse Suspected as Rival Sabotage: Augustine Jets Off to Switzerland with Shaken Lover for Recuperation.""

In the photos, his arm was wrapped protectively around her waist. Their departure date was the same day I was wheeled into surgery.

It was just like when I lost our baby. I'd lain alone in that hospital bed too—abandoned, forgotten.

While Augustine was away, I recovered in silence, enjoying the rare peace.

His deputy kept sending over lavish gifts: orchids air-shipped from France and exquisite jewels that screamed opulence.

I threw every single one out.

When I was finally discharged, I went to my old house in North Las Vegas.

There, I burned everything Augustine had ever given me.

As I walked out of the alley, a black military jeep was parked at the corner.

Augustine stood beside it, watching me.

""Cecilia's pregnant,"" he said quietly.

Chapter 5

Augustine leaned against the hood of his black SUV, lit a cigar, and dropped the bombshell of his mistress's pregnancy.

I didn't flinch.

""According to the agreement, when we divorce, the assets are split sixty–forty. You take the forty."" My voice was steady, emotionless.

""My mother's made it clear—only you can be my wife,"" he continued, his tone smooth, calculated. ""You don't have to worry. Even if Cecilia gives birth, she'll never be allowed to outrank you.

""I can live without a mistress, Kassandra, but not without a wife who can fight alongside me.""

It hit me like a cold splash. He didn't want a divorce, but it was not because he loved me, but because I was still useful to him.

""So what?"" I said coldly. ""I'm not the one keeping you from your true love. It's your mother. If you've got a problem, take it up with her,"" I shot back icily, sidestepping him to walk away.

""My mom wants you at the Clayton's mansion in three days,"" he said behind me. ""Once Cecilia's baby is born, you will be that baby's mother.""

I didn't break stride, my heels clicking defiantly against the pavement.

That night, I took another car back to our villa in Summerlin.

The first thing I did was check my accounts. Several tens of millions of dollars sat quietly in them. A fortune by ordinary standards, but compared to Augustine's arms empire, it was barely a ripple.

They say when a man gains wealth, he loses his morals. And when a woman loses her morals, she gains wealth.

If I were truly heartless, I could've stayed—lived on as Mrs. Clayton in name and enjoyed the money, the diamonds, and the power.

But I was done living a lie. I didn't want to rot away in this gilded cage any longer.

That night, I bought a one-way ticket to Dubai.

I'd leave the moment the divorce papers were finalized.

Three days later, I arrived at the Clayton mansion for the meeting. The air inside was heavy with tension.

The argument revolved entirely around Cecilia—whether she, armed with her pregnancy, could claw her way into legitimacy.

Shelly's tone was firm. ""The child cannot stay. The heir of our family will not be born from a disgrace.""

Augustine tapped his fingers on the table, his voice low but steady. ""Once the baby is born, I'll announce to the public that it's Kassandra's. She can't have kids of her own—this fixes everything perfectly.""

""No,"" Shelly cut him off sharply.

I set down my teacup and said quietly, ""The night I miscarried, you swore you'd never have a child with another woman for as long as you lived.""

Augustine's reply came low and gravelly, laced with weary resignation. ""Kassandra, we can't keep chaining ourselves to old vows forever.""

Before I could respond, a car horn blared outside—the courier had arrived.

I went out to sign for the delivery.

Inside the envelope were two divorce certificates.

I took mine, slipped it neatly into my bag, and turned to go back in.

As I turned my head, I saw Cecilia standing there, eyes burning with hatred.

""Kassandra, I hate you! Why do they all protect you?"" She screamed, her voice shrill and shaking.

I ignored her and moved to pass, but she grabbed my wrist with surprising strength.

""I'll make sure he never looks at you again!"" She shouted, and before I could react, she snatched a fruit knife from the table and plunged it into her own abdomen.

Augustine and others came running at the sound. When they arrived, Cecilia was curled on the floor, blood soaking through her dress.

""Augustine... She tried to kill me... She wanted to kill our baby...""

She gasped, her voice weak but clear enough to condemn me.

""Kassandra!"" Augustine roared. He scooped Cecilia into his arms, his eyes blazing with fury.

I stood there, unmoved. ""If the baby's gone, she has no one to blame but herself.""

The next second, his hand struck my face.

The sharp crack echoed through the hall.

""You evil bitch,"" he hissed, his voice colder than steel. ""We'll settle this when I get back.""

With that, he carried Cecilia out. I wiped the blood from the corner of my mouth and watched their car disappear into the distance.

Just then, my phone buzzed—a flight reminder. The plane to Los Angeles would be boarding soon.

Felicia approached quietly and gestured for me to check my messages.

A new text from her read, ""Sandra, I know that wasn't your doing. When you get to Dubai, contact this man. He runs a large arms business... and he's always admired you.""

I looked at the familiar name and number on the screen, then nodded slowly.

""Give this to Augustine,"" I said, handing her the copy of his divorce certificate.

""He's waited eight years for this moment. Tell him congratulations—from me.""

Then I picked up my suitcase and walked away without looking back.

I'd transfer in Los Angeles before heading to Dubai.

At the airport, I paused for a moment, watching the planes lift and vanish into the burning Nevada sky. Then I dialed the number Felicia had sent me.

A low, confident voice answered, warm with amusement. ""Long time no see, Sandra. When you land in Dubai, I'll be there to pick you up.""

""Alright,"" I replied softly.

I closed my eyes for a second, clutching my one-way ticket out of Las Vegas.

In my heart, I whispered, ""Augustine, we've tangled for eight long years.

""It's time I let you go... and set myself free.""",1,1763554602.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1

After the divorce, I left Las Vegas without a moment's hesitation.

I headed to Dubai alone, ready to start anew.

Over time, I carved out a name for myself in the shadowy world of Middle Eastern arms dealing.

Then, whispers from Las Vegas reached me: my ex-husband, Augustine Clayton, was about to get engaged to his little mistress.

I ran my fingers over the bullet pendant around my neck.

Eight years ago, during a brutal gang shootout, he'd taken that bullet for me. It had grazed perilously close to his heart, missing by a hair's breadth.

Once the surgeons pulled it out, he fashioned it into a necklace and slipped it around my neck.

His voice was soft, almost tender, as he whispered, ""From now on, my life is yours.""

Snapping back to the present, I yanked the chain off without a second thought and tossed it into the trash.

Back then, everyone sneered that I was just some prize Augustine had won at the casino tables—that without him, I'd be nothing.

Seven years later, I returned to Las Vegas to open a new mine.

At the negotiation table, Augustine, who ruled half the city, locked eyes with me, and in that instant, tears welled up in his eyes.

I, however, remembered what had happened at his father's funeral seven years earlier.

That day, he stood shoulder-to-shoulder with his mistress, letting her play the part of his wife, graciously accepting condolences from family and friends.

That day, I learned my husband had built a cozy little home with her in Centennial Hills.

I slid the divorce papers across the table to Augustine, calm and collected as ever.

""Sign them.""

Augustine arched an eyebrow, his expression dripping with amusement.

Tucked beneath the agreement was a newspaper, sensationalized to the hilt, detailing how Augustine's lover, Cecilia Webster, had stolen the spotlight at the funeral, leaving his real wife humiliated and sidelined.

""Kassandra, must you play these childish games again?"" he asked casually.

""For eight years, you've dangled divorce over my head like a threat—must be at least a hundred times by now. Haven't you gotten tired of this routine?""

Then he fished a black card out of his pocket and flicked it onto the table.

""If that's not enough, just hit up Brad—he'll wire you more. I've been swamped with work lately, but you can call me if you need anything.""

I didn't take the card. I simply cast a cool glance at Cecilia in his arms.

All the women Augustine had paraded around these years looked just like her.

I knew exactly why Augustine never married Cecilia after she came back.

After all, the wife of the underground king wasn't meant for the one he loved—it was for the one who fit the role, the strategic choice.

""You planning to keep her as your side piece forever?""

I nudged the divorce papers forward again.

Cecilia pouted in annoyance, clearly stung by the ""side piece"" label. She cooed in that saccharine voice of hers, ""Ms. Lambert, love's between two people. The one who's not loved is the real side piece.""

Augustine chuckled lightly, saying nothing to contradict her.

He stroked her cheek affectionately, then turned to me. ""We'll go to the church tomorrow morning. Don't be late.""

I didn't look away until his figure faded.

Every week, Augustine dragged me to church, saying it would cleanse us of our sins.

His mother, Shelly Clayton, often hinted that my barren womb was proof of my sin.

And Augustine? He saw my intolerance for his mistresses as the sin of jealousy.

Stepping into the church, I closed my eyes and began to pray.

When Augustine arrived, an inexplicable wave of panic gripped my heart.

""Kassandra,"" he called out.

My pulse quickened, a knot tightening in my chest.

""A sorcerer told me Cecilia's in for some bad luck this year. The only way to ward it off is to soak her feet in water mixed with your father's ashes.""

I shot to my feet, staring into his cold, impassive eyes in utter shock—then burst into a hollow laugh.

""Augustine, eight years ago, I consulted a fortune teller about us. I lied and said we were a perfect match, but the truth? He told me you will ruin my life, and we will never have a baby.

""If you so much as touch my father's grave, I'll smash your father's coffin to splinters.""

Over the years, I'd cried and raged over his endless affairs.

I'd learned the hard way: in this cutthroat jungle, no man respected a woman who endured everything without fighting back.

His face darkened in an instant.

""Do it!"" he ordered, his voice stern, brooking no dissent.

""Augustine!""

His henchmen pinned me down with iron grips, while the others desecrated my father's grave right before my eyes.

""Kassandra, this is for your father's own good. Ashes are useless. Helping Cecilia out? It's an honor for him.""

""Get the hell off me!""

Fueled by the absurdity of it all, I lashed out, shoving his goons aside and snatching the urn back.

Then, a brutal blow cracked against the back of my head.

Warm blood trickled down my forehead, blurring my vision.

I couldn't hold onto the urn anymore. Soon, someone ripped it from my arms.

In agony, I raised my head and, under the harsh sun, saw Augustine's cold face.

""Deliver it to the sorcerer,"" he said.

I forced a bitter smile and then blacked out.

Chapter 2

When I came to, I was in a hospital bed.

My loyal aide filled me in: Augustine had spent the last few days in Centennial Hills with Cecilia.

He had used my father's ashes for some twisted black magic ritual, trying to bind my dad's spirit, forcing his ghost to serve Cecilia like some obedient phantom.

I yanked out the IV needle, gathered a squad of men I'd trained, and went straight there.

Cecilia was lounging on the sofa, sipping coffee, her face draining of color when she saw me burst through the door.

I scanned the opulent villa and found a brand-new altar in the corner.

There, staring back at me, was my father's portrait.

The sight ignited an inferno of rage inside me, flames licking at my veins.

""Kassandra, you're not welcome here! If you try anything, I'll make sure Augustine...""

Before she could finish her threat, I lunged, grabbing a fistful of her hair and yanking her toward the altar.

""Looks like you still don't get it.

""I'm Augustine's real wife. Every damn penny from his arms empire? Half of it's mine! If I want you out of here, you won't last an hour.""

I stamped on her wrist with my combat boot, grinding down hard.

Cecilia let out a piercing shriek, agony ripping through her.

""You... you old hag! Augustine will never let you get away with this!""

I sneered, tightening my grip on her hair and slamming her face into the floor.

""You think you can stay young forever? In this world, youth is the cheapest commodity.

""You wanted my dad's ashes to break your curse? Foot-soaking's not enough. Here—drink every last drop of that filthy water!""

I signaled my men to hold her down, then poured the basin of ash-tainted water straight down her throat.

For every spill, I slapped her hard across the face.

By the time I let go, her cheeks were swollen, her lips bloodied.

Suddenly, urgent footsteps echoed behind us.

Augustine arrived, radiating an arctic chill, his private army following close behind, all weapons drawn and ready.

""Kassandra, you've crossed the line.""

His voice was a frozen blade as he bent down and scooped up the limp woman in his arms.

I met his glare head-on. ""Mr. Clayton, compared to what you've done, this is nothing.""

His eyes blazed with arctic rage.

""Throw her into the snake pit out back. No one pulls her out without my order.""

It was the venomous viper den he'd excavated just to indulge Cecilia's twisted whims.

""You wanted to watch an execution, right? Today, you'll get your fill,"" he murmured tenderly to the woman in his embrace.

Two burly guards dragged me roughly toward the rear of the property.

In the chilling depths of the cavern, serpents slithered forth, fangs sinking into my flesh with searing venom.

Agony exploded through me, blood soaking my clothes in a warm, sticky flood.

Before oblivion claimed me, I caught Cecilia's triumphant cackle.

I twisted my lips into a silent, sardonic smile.

Eight years ago, in front of all the crime lords, Augustine had sworn he'd only ever want me.

But his heart and his vows? They'd soured in just eight short years.

I spent two weeks in the hospital, nursing my wounds back to health.

During that time, the scandal exploded across Las Vegas: Augustine Clayton, pampering his mistress while letting his own wife bleed out in a snake pit. The whole city was buzzing.

On the day I was discharged, I made good on my promise—I shattered Augustine's father's coffin to pieces.

After venting my fury, I went to see Shelly.

""Shelly,"" I said, stepping into the room.

She opened her eyes, her gaze a tangled mix of pity and resignation.

""Could you pass this divorce agreement to Augustine for me?"" I handed over the papers, along with the newspaper that described my humiliating story.

""Kassandra, men are all the same. You need to wise up. Compared to power and money, love's just a fleeting illusion.

""Only when you stop letting a man control your heart do you truly come out on top.""

The destruction of her husband's coffin didn't faze her in the least.

In their youth, Augustine's father had chased countless mistresses and left a string of illegitimate children. She'd long since lost any illusions about him.

""Shelly, I married Augustine not because he was some rich heir, but because he was Augustine.""

It was love at first sight. Back in the boxing ring, covered in blood, his eyes fierce and unyielding—that image had pierced straight through my soul.

These eight years, leveraging the Clayton family's influence to build arms channels and a network of my own. I was no longer the vulnerable girl who needed his protection.

I'd stayed by his side only because I couldn't let go of that love, even as it rotted away.

""Once you're divorced, his mistresses will trample all over you,"" Shelly said.

I smiled. ""If she's got what it takes, let her try to climb.""

Chapter 3

When it came to Augustine's mistress, I felt nothing.

I knew Cecilia wasn't much of a threat.

A woman like her could only rely on her looks, and no true arms dealer would ever marry a woman who had nothing but a pretty face to offer.

Shelly stayed silent for a long time before finally ordering the maid to take away the divorce papers and the newspaper.

She stared at me for a while, then sighed. ""You know, there are countless women who would kill to be in your position.""

I didn't respond, just offered her a slight, respectful bow, and turned to leave.

Everyone envied me for standing at the pinnacle of power in Las Vegas, but only I knew what it truly cost.

My marriage with Augustine was like a field of poppies—beautiful on the surface but poisonous at its core.

As I stepped out, I ran into Augustine's cousin, Felicia Clayton.

""I thought you'd tolerate him for the rest of your life,"" she said dryly.

""I used to think so too,"" I replied with a faint smile.

She smirked. ""I'll admit, I never really liked you. But between you and that tramp from the red-light district in Mexico, I'd pick you any day.""

""You've been with him for eight years,"" she continued, folding her arms. ""You're really just going to walk away? Don't you feel it's a waste? You could still cash out.""

I chuckled. ""If I stay any longer, I might not make it out alive. What good is his money if I'm dead?""

Felicia burst out laughing. ""Relax. Good men are everywhere! After the divorce, I'll introduce you to someone—better than Augustine, richer than Augustine, and probably more of a gentleman too.""

That evening, Shelly's maid brought me the signed divorce papers.

I immediately sent them to the courthouse to finalize the process. Then, finally allowing myself to relax, I drew a hot bath.

Just as I was sinking into the water with a glass of red wine, the door burst open. Augustine stumbled in, reeking of alcohol.

He braced his arms on the edge of the tub, trapping me between them, his voice low and lazy. ""Good evening, darling.""

My hand froze midair.

I realized then that Shelly must've tricked him into signing those papers. He clearly had no idea what he'd signed.

Otherwise, he wouldn't still be calling me ""darling.""

I stood, wrapping a robe around myself, and pushed him away coldly.

""Still throwing tantrums?"" he asked, grabbing my wrist. ""Cecilia's nothing. It's over.""

I caught sight of the lipstick smudged on his collar and wrenched my hand free.

""It's not a tantrum. It's disgusting.

""Your taste, Augustine, is as cheap as the perfume Cecilia drowns herself in. It's revolting.""

The next day, for the first time, we didn't attend the Las Vegas jewelry auction together.

While Augustine was away, I recovered in silence, enjoying the rare peace.

His deputy kept sending over lavish gifts: orchids air-shipped from France and exquisite jewels that screamed opulence.

I threw every single one out.

When I was finally discharged, I went to my old house in North Las Vegas.

There, I burned everything Augustine had ever given me.

As I walked out of the alley, a black military jeep was parked at the corner.

Augustine stood beside it, watching me.

""Cecilia's pregnant,"" he said quietly.

Chapter 5

Augustine leaned against the hood of his black SUV, lit a cigar, and dropped the bombshell of his mistress's pregnancy.

I didn't flinch.

""According to the agreement, when we divorce, the assets are split sixty–forty. You take the forty."" My voice was steady, emotionless.

""My mother's made it clear—only you can be my wife,"" he continued, his tone smooth, calculated. ""You don't have to worry. Even if Cecilia gives birth, she'll never be allowed to outrank you.

""I can live without a mistress, Kassandra, but not without a wife who can fight alongside me.""

It hit me like a cold splash. He didn't want a divorce, but it was not because he loved me, but because I was still useful to him.

""So what?"" I said coldly. ""I'm not the one keeping you from your true love. It's your mother. If you've got a problem, take it up with her,"" I shot back icily, sidestepping him to walk away.

""My mom wants you at the Clayton's mansion in three days,"" he said behind me. ""Once Cecilia's baby is born, you will be that baby's mother.""

I didn't break stride, my heels clicking defiantly against the pavement.

That night, I took another car back to our villa in Summerlin.

The first thing I did was check my accounts. Several tens of millions of dollars sat quietly in them. A fortune by ordinary standards, but compared to Augustine's arms empire, it was barely a ripple.

They say when a man gains wealth, he loses his morals. And when a woman loses her morals, she gains wealth.

If I were truly heartless, I could've stayed—lived on as Mrs. Clayton in name and enjoyed the money, the diamonds, and the power.

But I was done living a lie. I didn't want to rot away in this gilded cage any longer.

That night, I bought a one-way ticket to Dubai.

I'd leave the moment the divorce papers were finalized.

Three days later, I arrived at the Clayton mansion for the meeting. The air inside was heavy with tension.

The argument revolved entirely around Cecilia—whether she, armed with her pregnancy, could claw her way into legitimacy.

Shelly's tone was firm. ""The child cannot stay. The heir of our family will not be born from a disgrace.""

Augustine tapped his fingers on the table, his voice low but steady. ""Once the baby is born, I'll announce to the public that it's Kassandra's. She can't have kids of her own—this fixes everything perfectly.""

""No,"" Shelly cut him off sharply.

I set down my teacup and said quietly, ""The night I miscarried, you swore you'd never have a child with another woman for as long as you lived.""

Augustine's reply came low and gravelly, laced with weary resignation. ""Kassandra, we can't keep chaining ourselves to old vows forever.""

Before I could respond, a car horn blared outside—the courier had arrived.

I went out to sign for the delivery.

Inside the envelope were two divorce certificates.

I took mine, slipped it neatly into my bag, and turned to go back in.

As I turned my head, I saw Cecilia standing there, eyes burning with hatred.

""Kassandra, I hate you! Why do they all protect you?"" She screamed, her voice shrill and shaking.

I ignored her and moved to pass, but she grabbed my wrist with surprising strength.

""I'll make sure he never looks at you again!"" She shouted, and before I could react, she snatched a fruit knife from the table and plunged it into her own abdomen.

Augustine and others came running at the sound. When they arrived, Cecilia was curled on the floor, blood soaking through her dress.

""Augustine... She tried to kill me... She wanted to kill our baby...""

She gasped, her voice weak but clear enough to condemn me.

""Kassandra!"" Augustine roared. He scooped Cecilia into his arms, his eyes blazing with fury.

I stood there, unmoved. ""If the baby's gone, she has no one to blame but herself.""

The next second, his hand struck my face.

The sharp crack echoed through the hall.

""You evil bitch,"" he hissed, his voice colder than steel. ""We'll settle this when I get back.""

With that, he carried Cecilia out. I wiped the blood from the corner of my mouth and watched their car disappear into the distance.

Just then, my phone buzzed—a flight reminder. The plane to Los Angeles would be boarding soon.

Felicia approached quietly and gestured for me to check my messages.

A new text from her read, ""Sandra, I know that wasn't your doing. When you get to Dubai, contact this man. He runs a large arms business... and he's always admired you.""

I looked at the familiar name and number on the screen, then nodded slowly.

""Give this to Augustine,"" I said, handing her the copy of his divorce certificate.

""He's waited eight years for this moment. Tell him congratulations—from me.""

Then I picked up my suitcase and walked away without looking back.

I'd transfer in Los Angeles before heading to Dubai.

At the airport, I paused for a moment, watching the planes lift and vanish into the burning Nevada sky. Then I dialed the number Felicia had sent me.

A low, confident voice answered, warm with amusement. ""Long time no see, Sandra. When you land in Dubai, I'll be there to pick you up.""

""Alright,"" I replied softly.

I closed my eyes for a second, clutching my one-way ticket out of Las Vegas.

In my heart, I whispered, ""Augustine, we've tangled for eight long years.

""It's time I let you go... and set myself free.""",1,1763554588.0,NovelLinks,1,1.0,False
