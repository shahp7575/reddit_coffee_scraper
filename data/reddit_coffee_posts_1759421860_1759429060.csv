I’m a 22M working in the corporate world here in Hinjawadi, Pune. Work’s going good, but outside of office it feels like something’s missing. Would love to connect with someone who’s up for casual hangouts, coffee meets, exploring new spots in the city, or just having fun conversations after a long workday.

I’m more into chilled vibes, meaningful talks, and maybe even spontaneous plans if the comfort clicks.

1nwba0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/NinjaLuxeCafe/comments/1nwba0i/es601eu_vs_es701eu_honest_review/,ES601EU VS ES701EU -honest review-,"Hi guys,

As I tested both machines, I see it as my duty to provide a short review on my takes on these two machines.

Ninja EU has a 60 days return policy, so I decided to try the most expensive model as I read that the models without the integrated tamper can make quite a mess. And as I didn’t wanna make my wife mad, I went for the 701.

So what does the 701 have what the 601 doesn’t:

- integrated tamper (duh…) which makes making couple of shots quite fast… BUT I’m absolutely not bothered by the funnel on the 601. It gives me a nice barista feeling, allows me to use a WDT (don’t know whether that really makes a difference but anyways…), tamp nicely. I would guess that’s why I pull better shots!
- the milk steamer is DEFINITELY a lot cooler and MUCH easier to clean. This is a fact I 100% can confirm.
- larger milk can BUT even if I make two lattes, I like to froth the milk separately for each coffee.
- buttons are different, I would say harder to use on the 701 but that’s just preference.
- milk frothing is definitely a bit faster on the 701. I’d say 30 seconds vs 45 seconds.

What’s the same:
- barista assist cannot make it’s mind on both machines. Goes from 12 to 10 to 12 to 10.

What does the 601 offer that the 701 doesn’t: 300 euro price difference. I bought the 601 for 400 euros whereas the 701 was 700 euros. 

I believe that people that buy a ninja cafe luxe like to experiment with coffee and wanna have that barista feeling. The 601 definitely gives that feeling whereas the 701 takes it away. However the 701 has that nice integrated tamper and definitely better steam wand. So it’s up to you, but it was the 601 for me.

I believe Ninja made an awesome move with this machine. I bought an automated coffee machine from Philips, that coffee tastes truly like SH@&€TTT. It’s an insult to call that an espresso…

I hope to have done my duty by giving this honest review. Would like to hear the comments.

BTW Ninja EU has the best return policy I’ve ever seen. Packed everything, send it back and received my money within 5 days. Awesome.

1nwb74x,https://i.redd.it/pa5y6zalkqsf1.png,Thermal mug with handle - something to keep the tea warm I keep forgetting about. Can I do better than Contigo? Preferably under 20EUR and a global brand (I'm from Poland and a lot of US stuff is not available here),"I'm looking for a thermal mug with handle - something to keep my tea warm. Everything bigger than a double espresso I keep forgetting about and end up drinking it cold.

* **STABILITY AND HANDLE**. Typical travel thermal mugs I keep knocking over and I don't want to damage my computer. It has to be stable and with a firm handle like a traditional mug.
* **WARM:** something that's going to work better than those 5EUR chinese crappers that people keep selling with their logo for 30EUR. I bet you can tell what products I'm talking about. I don't expect the coffee to be scolding hot after 8 hours, but it would be nice if it didn't go back to the room temp after 2 hours or sth.
* **EASY TO CLEAN:** I've seen some comments about certain mugs having over-designed lid and a guy got his mouldy from milk and sugar (it's in the reddit post mentioned below). I've had my own problems with some cheap, supermarket button ones in the past.
* **PRICE REFLECTING THE QUALITY AND FUNCTIONALITY:** I bet you guys don't want to pay just for the logo. I think under 20EUR is reasonable for a mug, if there's something **really worth it** above that I'll be very happy to do research and thinking about it. 

**What I found on my own:**

**Contigo -** the one from the main picture. The reviews on local go-to online store (allegro.pl) seem somewhat mixed - there's a lot of ""weirdly positive ones"" and few people commenting that it's not worth the price. I wonder if they are particularly picky or if the positive ones got greased.

I have found another brand, I think it was **Camp Mug Stanley**, but it's more than twice the price of the Contigo and I'm not sure if the quality and warm-keeping is crazy good or it's just some English brand or sth.

Lore:

I was browsing the thermal mugs and it's super hard to cut-through rebranded TEMU crap these days. I've found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1hgy4mr/leakproof_insulated_travel_mug_recommendations/) , and found some interesting companies recommended. However, the author of that post was looking for something for car travel and I'm looking for something that's exactly the opposite. I have a dozen of those travel mugs and they're decent for quick car coffee, but at my desk I keep knocking them over... Right now I have a cheap plastic one I bought specifically for reusable car coffee use - it's not bad, but it doesn't hold warmth at all.

At first I thought about buying a coffe maker that heats the pot, (my clumsy ass knocked over the last one during cleaning and the pot shattered). I used to make big pot of tea for the day and we'd drink it for hours. However it wasn't without downsides - we didn't use it outside of colder months and it was another useless space-taker. I've decided it's better to get more all-rounder thermal mugs. We already have a pair for cocoa, but they are the handle-less ones and I don't want to spill it onto my work station. They were cheap, so they are good to keep the drink warm up to \~40 minutes tops.",0,1759428348.0,BuyItForLife,0,0.5,False
1nwb6zn,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1nwb6zn/i_dont_think_i_can_just_date/,I don’t think I can just date,"My BFF gave me the advice to just have fun, date multiple guys, maybe some of them would show potential. And some would just be for fun. Sounds like a good plan. 

So I went on the dating apps for maybe a week and all the constant messages were annoying. I felt like I needed to respond to everyone bc they could ‘possibly’ be the right person. So I turned it off, but still had some matches on the go. 

Fast forward to now, 1 match is going well, we actually have mutual friends, lots in common. There was some sparks during our first coffee date. And then more during our dinner and mini golf date last night. Made out like teenagers in the parking lot. So great potential here. 

There was one other match I was still entertaining only because it seems to take awhile for either of us to respond to each other. But now he wants to meet for dinner tomorrow. And I’m conflicted. My bff tells me to go for it, you never know how it’ll go, amd I was/am hesitant to agree. And my other close friend says no, I seem to have a good thing going already and I was immediately like ‘ya you’re right!’  

Do I follow my gut or does my heart seem to be clouded by infatuation already for the first date?

Also. I can say no to guy #2. And if things don’t work out for guy #1 then back to the apps I go and there will be other guys   ",0,1759428339.0,breakingmom,1,0.5,False

""I've never broken a bone before"" or ""haven't had car trouble in a long time"".  This is so engrained in me, that even typing the words has me reaching for the coffee table to give it a little tap.

Over the years I went from being a true believer in the Jinx to it being a quaint custom linking me to my family to the full circle of ""are my words unintentionally becoming Intentions?!"" When I started practicing a few decades ago it was definitely something I had to reconcile. 

It is on my mind today because I have been going thru a cycle that happens a few times a year where it seems every time I open my mouth to comment on something mundane it is a catalyst.  Just yesterday, I mentioned that our old fridge has been trucking along much longer than expected then last night it had issues!  

So, my fellow witches, what do you think?  Can an off hand comment become Intentions, perhaps during a certain astral alignment or special individual circumstances?  Is it just intuition in overdrive?  Picking up on small cues subconsciously?  Or plain ole Concidence...

Six months ago I was living what I thought was a decent life. Married for eight years, two kids, nice house in the suburbs. My husband worked long hours as an engineer and I stayed home with the kids. And yeah, I was lonely. He'd come home exhausted, eat dinner in silence, and fall asleep on the couch. We hadn't had sex in four months. I felt invisible.

My best friend since college was going through the same thing with her husband. We'd meet for coffee and complain about how our husbands didn't appreciate us anymore. How we'd become boring. How we were still young and attractive but felt like we were dying inside.

Then her husband started coming to pick her up from our coffee dates. He was charming. Funny. He'd compliment my hair or my outfit. Little things my own husband never noticed anymore. We started texting. Just friendly stuff at first. Then it got flirtier.

It started at a barbecue at their house. My husband was on his phone dealing with work stuff. My friend was inside with the kids. Her husband and I were alone in the garage and he kissed me. I kissed him back.

The affair lasted three months. We'd meet at hotels during the day while our spouses worked. It was exciting and I felt wanted again. I felt alive. I told myself I deserved this after years of being neglected.

My husband found out when her husband's wife found the hotel receipts and called him. She was screaming on our doorstep at 9pm on a Tuesday. The kids heard everything.

My husband just looked at me and said, ""Pack a bag and get out.""

I tried to explain. I told him I was lonely. That he pushed me away. That I needed attention and affection and he gave me nothing.

He said, ""So you fucked your best friend's husband. Real mature solution.""

I stayed at my mom's. My mom who looked at me like I was a stranger. She kept saying, ""How could you do this? Those poor children."" She meant my kids. And my friend's kids. Two families destroyed because I was selfish.

My husband filed for divorce immediately. His lawyer was brutal. They brought up everything. The affair. The lies. The fact that I abandoned my children to sleep with another married man. I got supervised visitation only. He got primary custody.

My friend divorced her husband too. But she got full custody and a massive settlement. Her family supported her. Mine stopped talking to me. My own sister won't return my calls.

The divorce finalized two months ago. My ex got the house, the kids, everything. I got an apartment and weekends with my children supervised by his mother who glares at me the entire time. My kids barely look at me. My daughter is nine and she asked me once, ""Why did you leave us for him?""

I didn't know what to say.

Three weeks ago my ex started dating someone. A woman from his work. She's younger than me. Prettier. I saw her Instagram because my daughter mentioned her name. She posts pictures with my kids. My kids smiling with her. Calling her by her first name like she's their friend.

Something broke in me.

I drove to the house at 2am last Thursday. I still had my old garage code because he hadn't changed it. I got inside and went upstairs to see my kids. I just wanted to kiss them goodnight. To be their mom again.

My ex woke up when I opened my son's bedroom door. He came out of his room and saw me standing there. He didn't yell. He just pulled out his phone and called the police.

I started crying and begging him. ""Please. They're my kids too. I just wanted to see them.""

He said, ""You lost that right when you chose him over them.""

The cops came. They arrested me for breaking and entering. Criminal trespass. My ex filed a restraining order. I can't go near the house or my kids now. My supervised visitation is suspended pending a court hearing.

I spent the night in jail. My mom bailed me out but she cried the whole drive home. She said, ""What is wrong with you? You had everything and you threw it away.""

She's right. I threw it away because I felt neglected. Because I was bored and selfish and stupid. I destroyed two families. My best friend won't speak to me. Her ex-husband moved to another state and wants nothing to do with me. My kids hate me. My ex is building a new life without me.

I have a criminal record now. I might lose my visitation rights completely. My lawyer says I need therapy and anger management to have any chance of seeing my kids again. My family looks at me with disgust. I lost my job because word got around about the arrest.

I sit in my tiny apartment alone every night thinking about how I used to tuck my kids into bed. How I used to have a husband who loved me before I broke him. How I had a best friend who trusted me.

All of it gone because I couldn't handle being lonely like a normal person. Because I made the worst choice possible and kept making worse choices to cover it up.

My ex is happy now. He's moving on. My kids are adjusting. Everyone is fine except me.

So am I the one who deserves all this or did I just make one mistake that spiraled out of control?

1nwb1kt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1nwb1kt/old_me_trying_to_survive/,Old me trying to survive,"So recently I had this dream where I feel the old me knew that she is disappearing so she is trying her best to revive herself (for more context can refer to the attached post)

Even since that dream, few “bad things” started to show up in 3D where the old me would have been impacted ALOT, start having anxiety, existential crisis etc. But, I honestly have never been calmer or more content in my life. No matter what happen and despite I might told my friend about what happened and all but I know that I’m saying it as a story or conversation topic not because I’m sad or impacted by it.

Everytime I start thinking about the “bad things”, I will immediately tell myself that Demn i really can manifest everything huh the 3D lag now is really my old thoughts I really did thought about all this and now it is all showing up.

So while all the “bad things” happening, I keep getting success too like I will think tmr somebody is asking me out and I’m not going out. BOOM, next day someone that I never talk before but we followed each other on insta(but honestly I have no idea who he is) replied my story and asked am I up for a drink.

I try again with this week someone is buying me coffee. BOOM, my colleague suddenly offer to buy my whole team coffee on Wed. But I wasn’t in office on Wed so I was thinking Ngaw I demand this but I miss it but nope I’m still getting that coffee. BOOM, Thurs my colleague told me he bought the cold brew bottle and kept in the fridge for me since I’m not in on Wed.

What inspire me to write this is because I realized that “ghost old me dream” is like a sign or hint for me that old me is not going to disappear that easily and she is trying everything she can to pull me back down again but NOPE girl is on next level now and I know I am always chosen in love in life in everything and everything ALWAYS works in my favour

1nwb07x,https://www.reddit.com/r/olfactivechemistry/comments/1nwb07x/the_smell_of_deliciousness_has_a_name_the/,"The ""smell of deliciousness"" has a name: The Maillard Reaction. It's not just browning—it's a complex chemical symphony that makes us hungry.","TL;DR: The Maillard Reaction is the chemical process that creates the complex, irresistible smell of cooked food. It's not just browning; it's a symphony of hundreds of aroma compounds that make your kitchen smell like heaven and trigger a primal hunger in your brain.


We all know that incredible smell. The one that hits you when bread is baking, when coffee is roasting, or when a steak hits a hot pan. That's the smell of pure magic happening.

But it's not magic. It's hardcore food chemistry, and it's called the Maillard Reaction (pronounced ""My-yard"").

Most people think it's just ""browning,"" but that's like calling a symphony ""just noise."" The Maillard Reaction is the reason these smells are so complex and irresistible.

So, what's really happening?

It's a chemical dance between amino acids (the building blocks of protein) and reducing sugars when they're heated. This dance creates HUNDREDS of new aroma compounds. Think of it as the food's flavor puberty—it's transforming into something more complex and beautiful.

Here’s the ""orchestra"" of smells the Maillard Reaction creates:

· The Nutty/Roasty Section: PYRAZINES
  · What they smell like: Roasted coffee, toasted nuts, dark chocolate, freshly baked bread crust.
  · Your brain thinks: ""Warm, complex, comforting.""
· The Caramel/Sweet Section: FURANS
  · What they smell like: Caramel, sweet, buttery, sometimes with a fruity twist.
  · Your brain thinks: ""Sweet, rich, indulgent.""
· The Meaty/Savory Section: THIAZOLES & others
  · What they smell like: Savory, roasted meat, popcorn, and even a bit earthy.
  · Your brain thinks: ""Hearty, satisfying, UMAMI BOMB.""

This is why you can't replicate the smell of a searing steak with just ""beef"" flavor. It's not one note; it's a chorus. The smell of baking bread isn't just ""flour and heat""; it's a volatile cloud of nutty, buttery, and roasty aromas that our brains have evolved to find deeply appealing.

The Maillard Reaction is the smell of transformation. It's the signal that simple, bland ingredients are being turned into something nutritious, safe to eat, and packed with energy. Our ancestors who were drawn to this smell were more likely to eat cooked, calorie-rich food and survive. We are literally hardwired to salivate when we smell it.",1,1759427940.0,olfactivechemistry,0,1.0,False

My manager has been acting… different with me, and I can’t tell if it’s just friendliness or if he’s lowkey flirting.

Some things i’ve noticed:

	•	He gives me these intense looks, like piercing eye contact, and sometimes stands really close.

	•	He’ll smirk while staring into my eyes when talking.

	•	Once in the break room I was awkwardly standing while eating a sandwich, and he looked at my phone then smirked and told me to “sit down and eat.”

	•	After not seeing me for a month, when he saw me again, he paused in his tracks toward me and his eyes widened a bit.

	•	He stutters and gets awkward around me sometimes…like today, he randomly said “morning” walking past me out of nowhere even though we’d been working together since early morning for hours.

	•	At the opening of a new site, instead of directly asking me to join a photo, he gave me this facial signal to step in.

	•	This morning, he walked beside me and said, “Oh, I didn’t know you’d be here, I would’ve brought you coffee… I’ll bring it next time. Cappuccino, right?” (And yeah, I told him “yes, one shot.” The funny thing is, he had literally just brought coffee for another colleague before saying this to me, and i don’t remember telling him my go-to is cappuccino).

is this just him being nice and manager-y

Would love to hear how others would read this.

TLDR. I’m a 25M. I’ve had celiac disease my entire life. 

I eat nuts and things that contain all kinds of nuts all the time. I’ve been obsessed with salt and vinegar pistachios for years. 

Monday I went to this coffee shop and got this Nutella and Walnut muffin like I do usually several times a week. Later that night, my mom had these walnut GF cookies and I ate one and realized my throat felt scratchy. Didn’t think much of it. Next morning I ate another one and realized the same thing.

Still today I have a scratchy throat which I know wouldn’t be attributed to an allergy as I haven’t eaten anything period in 20 hours. 

I’m a massive hypochondriac so not sure if it’s that , I have a cold, or I now have a nut allergy? I understand they can come on randomly but I had just had tree nuts hours before the walnut cookie. It can happen that fast??

I can’t see an allergist for 3 months apparently :/ I know that’s the only real way to know but like, this is odd right?

1nwaueu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1nwaueu/the_intimacy_of_waiting/,The Intimacy of Waiting,"We didn’t meet in any grand, cinematic moment.  
No rush across crowded streets.  
No fateful bump.  
No spark under flickering streetlights.

You were just another number in my phone, until you weren’t.

It started quietly, almost accidentally, the way rain seeps into the earth. Before we ever took a single step toward each other, there were nights, countless nights filled with voices and messages. Calls that stretched past midnight, where the silences between our words felt as full as the words themselves. Texts that arrived like small gifts:

“Good morning”  
“I saw this and it reminded me of you”  
“Are you still awake?”

Sometimes we fell asleep mid-call. I would wake to your breathing drifting through the line, or you would wake to my half-formed “goodnight” echoing faintly. In the mornings, I dragged myself through work, coffee in hand, eyelids heavy, but even that exhaustion felt sweet. A secret only we shared.

In between the long nights and days came the little things. Pictures of food, “see this, your favorite” cheesecake, a plate of dumplings, chai, home-cooked meals, sent just because we thought of showing them to each other.

And always, without fail, your reminder when the clock blinked 11:11:

“Make a wish.”

You never missed it. Not once.

Sometimes you’d ask, teasing but gentle:  
“Aren’t you tired after being in office working all day?”

And I’d laugh softly, answering:  
“Not tired enough to stop listening to you… not tired enough to miss this.""

Somewhere in between, you’d tell me to cut the call once I fell asleep.  
But I’d whisper back, “Stay with me a little longer?”  
And you would only hum in reply, a soft “hmm"" before your voice faded into a quiet, drowsy ""goodnight""

Somewhere in those hours, we began to make promises. Whispered plans spoken into the dark as though speaking to them aloud would make them real.

“When we meet, we’ll go to that little café first.""  
“And then… we’ll take a long walk?""  
“Yes. And I’ll count each step with you.""  
""A walk near the Beach?""  
""Definitely!""

And then, after a pause, your voice, smaller, uncertain:  
“We have plenty of time, don’t we?""

I smiled, though you couldn’t see it.  
“Time will never run short for us, ma'am""

Talking to you became more than a habit. It was a lullaby not because it put me to sleep, but because it made me safe. Your voice slowed the rush in my head. It dimmed the world’s noise. The weight of turning thirty soon didn’t feel so heavy anymore when you were on the other end of the line.

Before the first step, there was patience. It held us in its quiet arms. It let us grow familiar in absence. It turned waiting into care, and silence into intimacy.

And then, one evening, years later, in a crowded café, here we are.

No cinematic swell of music. Just you, sitting by the window, scrolling on your phone, a half-finished cup of chai beside you.

Me? Distracted by the way you tuck that stray strand of hair behind your ear, by the blink of your eyes, and by that million-dollar smile of yours…a smile that feels like a social service in itself. For a moment, time thickened.

You smiled faintly, guarded.  
“Yeah. It’s been…what, years?”

“Yeah, those nights?” I asked. “The calls that never ended. I used to wake up for office with just two hours of sleep.”

You teased back, but softly:  
“And still, you’d say ‘Not tired enough to stop listening to you’""

We sat. The air between us was full of things unsaid. Our eyes darted to our cups, the table, anywhere but each other.

We both smiled, but our eyes held something heavier.

“We had plans” I said. “That café you wanted to show me, the long walk by the beach…""

You interrupted gently, firmly:  
“We never took that step to meet then”

Silence. The weight of lost time settled.

“Now it’s just memories” you whispered, almost to yourself.

“We moved on, didn’t we?”

I still wish that someday, maybe, those small promises will bloom. Until then, I carry your voice into my dreams, waking with the quiet certainty that even now, even after everything, time will never feel too little for us.

The noise of the café rose around us, cups clinking, spoons stirring. We sat as strangers who once weren't.

I turned away first, my gaze lost in the café's hum.  
“Time…” I said softly. ""It ran out after all, didn’t it?""",1,1759427586.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,1,1.0,False

When I lived alone, I also made sure to decorate for Halloween bc growing up my parents never did that. 
My grandma took a look at the decorations and rolled her eyes and looked at my mom like “this is stupid” and my mom also kinda just made a stank face about it. I was considerate enough that the house isn’t fully mine so I didn’t go ALL OUT like I would if it was my house. 

Two nights ago, my nephew came over and he was asleep (he’s 4). My mom told me to quiet my toddler down and to not be loud bc he needs to sleep and rest. She also made sure to walk quietly around the house. Whenever my daughter is sleeping, my mom and grandma yell across the house at each other, speak loud, slam doors, put dishes away loudly, stomp, all with the excuse that my daughter has to learn to sleep in any environment…no respect to her at all 

There have been many times my grandma cooks meals and tells me not to touch them because they’re specifically for my nephew and that she’s going to drop it off at his house. (Even though he has two parents who are more than ok at cooking). My grandma will go out and buy snacks and tell me they’re not for my baby and they’re saved for my nephew. Not once has she bought a snack or made my daughter a meal. I am a SAHM but my job is also very tiring some times. I also struggle with getting groceries sometime and they know that bc the fridge sits close to empty before I have enough money to get more groceries (our baby is always fed! She has her groceries that no one is allowed to touch.) 

My mom told me yesterday that I have no right to ask her to not eat my food or anything bc she’s letting my fiance use one of her cars to get to work. So she’s holding the help SHE OFFERED over us to not hold boundaries against food that we buy. 

We budget tightly but still get to splurge here and there on our daughter. There have been times my grandma says she wants specific toys in her room for my daughter only for me to go to my nephews house and see THOSE TOYS IN HIS LIVINGROOM. 

Any boundary I set gets dismissed or I get laughed at. A big one is not giving my daughter food or drinks without me knowing what it is. My grandma eats in her room and will call my daughter over to give her jalapeño, Chili’s, soda, coffee, juice, all the shit we have told her we are not giving our daughter at all. My grandma just laughs at me and says “oh stop being dramatic”. 

I know I should move out. I should have moved out a year ago! We just can’t afford it. My mom can’t afford to live on her own without our rent money and we can’t afford to rent an apartment anywhere near us because everywhere we look it’s 2,500 a month starting!! And that’s in the ghetto. In the area we live it’s $3,500+ to rent an apartment. I’ve applied to so many housing assistance programs and apartments but never hear back. I don’t know what to do now in this moment - I can’t just pack up and leave. 

Also, my fiance does step in when they disrespect me. But then they gang up on him and start telling me he’s disrespecting them and that they won’t tolerate a disrespectful man in their house (they’re those type of feminists - like if you’re not a working woman in a corporate job, you’re lazy)",1,1759427194.0,Moms,1,1.0,False

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!), maybe slightly flirty if things go that way naturally. I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction!

1nwaiqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1nwaiqn/my_employee_stole_work_tablet_and_payment/,My employee stole work tablet and payment terminal from our cafe,"I (F27) am the manager of a small coffee shop. We employ a lot of people who struggle with mental health and try to gently introduce them to having a job. One of those employees (F31) is Shayla. She has an early disability retirement due to her diagnosis which causes her to have aggressive outbursts and therefore cannot keep a job for longer than 3 months. We have been able to work with her for over a year, she has made friends among her coworkers and despite an occasional outburst, things have always managed to get smoothed over. But each outburst got more intense and it started destroying her relationships. After her latest outburst three months ago, me and the owner of the cafe had a long talk with her, after which she decided to go on sick leave to look after her mental health. During these three months I got bombarded by messages attacking me and everyone at the cafe.

I sat down with her yesterday and had another long talk expressing our feelings and experiences at the end of it we apologised to each other and came to a decision to give her a trial shift today to see if she’ll be able to work here still. 

Well… that brings me to the title of this post. She came in and went in the kitchen to prepare some sandwiches. After a couple minutes I heard her arguing with someone on the phone but I didn’t hear what was said. After another couple minutes she walked out of the kitchen, took the tablet and terminal, put it in her backpack and tried to leave with it. I blocked her path and for about ten minutes I tried to reason with her and convince her to return the things. She refused and threatened to end her life and harm herself. In moment of me trying to figure out what to do next, she slipped away and ran away, I tried to chase after her, screaming at her to return but she wouldn’t.

So I called the police, told them the situation and stressed that I’m more scared of what she might do to herself. The police dispatch three search parties and searched the area but they couldn’t find her. I returned to the cafe and relayed the information to the barista on shift. We still managed to open, taking cash only, the barista (F20) took it in stride and did her work diligently while I kept communicating with the boss and the police. I must say I’m really proud of my barista, she was professional about the situation while also being empathetic towards me and Shayla.
After a while I got a call from my dad, that Shayla ran to him and he managed to convince her to return the tablet and terminal which he then sent to the cafe via a taxi.

The police arrived to the cafe around that time and asked about an update to the situation so I relayed to them that things are returned but stressed that I am still incredibly concerned about her well-being since after talking to my dad, she took public transport and left who knows where and she’s not a mentally stable state at the moment. I gave them her address and phone number and they said they’ll check on her.
After another hour I got a message from a mutual friend of ours that Shayla claimed she got home. So I called the police again to update them on the situation and asked them to please check on her, once again giving them her phone number and address while informing them that if they do try to contact her through a call she might not respond well, since she has a bad history with the police and doesn’t trust them. They said that they will check up on her at the address. That was 7 hours ago. While I don’t think we can let her keep working here under these circumstances, I do worry for her but I haven’t heard any updates and I have no idea what is happening to her at the moment.

I am so incredibly shaken by the situation and I don’t know what else I can do and I’m sure she wouldn’t respond to me if I tried to reach her so now I’m just sitting here, processing it all. Thank god I have therapy tomorrow haha…

I don’t know what to do and I don’t know what I’m expecting from sharing this here, I just feel dazed at the moment. 

I don’t expect anyone to read this or even react, but if anyone does read this and wants any more context, I’m happy to share. And if I find out anything more, I am happy to update you too.

I started with just the standard store brand, orange flavored Metamucil substitute, but I wanted to switch to unflavored bulk powders both to save money and so I could mix it with more things, like my protein shakes or morning coffee.

But just a glance of the available brands on Amazon is showing huge differences in what you get for your dose and money. My baseline was what I started with--Metamucil, which claimes 3g fiber per teaspoon. But I look at Organic India, which says it has 4g per tablespoon, which is only 1.33g per tsp. Himalaya brand claims 5g per (""heaping"") teaspoon. Viva Naturals 4g per tsp. Zen Spirit 8g per tablespoon (2.6g per tsp). And on and on and on. No two labels agree.

And that isn't even accounting for variations in all the other calorie and macro numbers.

How is this possible? Why wouldn't plantago/psyllium be like any other base ingredient and have a consistent nutrient profile? Are most of the companies bs'ing, and if so, who comes closet to what you should expect from a fiber supplement?",1,1759426867.0,Supplements,3,1.0,False

1nwai2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1nwai2c/aita_meta_wants_to_veto_me_after_2_years/,AITA - Meta wants to veto me after 2 years,"This is long, I'm sorry, but there's lots of tea to spill and it all seems to matter to the question of, AITA?

Background: We are all early 40's. Partner and his wife (here forth called ""meta"") had been married 15 years before they opened up to polyamory (a few years ago) after meta expressed wanting more physical interaction in her life, due to lack of drive from depression from my partner. It was her decision and insisting, though he ultimately agreed, and went along with it whole heartedly. He has no resentment about that at all, but her being the one initiating and insisting on it seems pertinent to me.

Partner and I began dating just under 2 years ago, and we've gotten very serious with each other. We love each other dearly and want a future together. That has never ever been a plan to have a life separate from our families, and our families know our commitment to them... our long term goals are just continuing to be together, loving each other, and experiencing this life together as we continue to grow older. We do not live together, and that has not been on the table due to our lives and our desire to stay with our families.

A few months after partner and I started dating, we brought my husband and his wife (meta) to dinner with us to meet each other. We knew we were getting much closer to one another and would inevitably be interacting with each other's families. It went really well and everyone enjoyed being together. It went SO well in fact, that meta and my husband began dating, and dated for over a year. That was not a planned thing, and there was never a real ""quad"" situation where any lines crossed all together - just 4 separate relationships among 4 people. We didn't have any other partners in that time frame, and the only one who has added new partners since is my husband (only after their break up and nothing serious).

Partner and meta had some problems in their marriage, as most marriages do... communication, different love styles, etc. Nothing overly tragic or things that couldn't be adjusted to and worked around, and had been navigated as best as possible for years.

Partner and I spend 3 days a week with each other, and it is always at one of our homes. Every 2 weeks he comes here for 3 days. Alternating weeks I go there for 3 days. If our families need us for anything during that time, we go back to our homes and do what they need. We try to find things to do all together, and we spend a lot of time with our families. When meta and my husband were dating, they ALSO spent 3 days a week with each other, just at opposite houses. When I was at partner's house, meta was at my house, and vise versa. 

A year ago meta got very upset about the overnight trip that Partner and I had planned for our anniversary. She was fine with it when we originally planned it, but since we didn't pick our hotel until 2 weeks prior, she got angry and said that from that point forward she would need at LEAST 6 weeks notice to anything that we choose to do, and preferably 2 months or more. I feel that is absolutely unfair, but we complied and didn't complain, because we didn't want to rock the boat and because Partner and I are less rigid in what we need in order to be happy. Our trip was canceled because she was so upset, and we just had dinner for our anniversary.

Once my husband and meta broke up, meta began closing off to polyamory, and to me. She asked my Partner if he would ever go back to monogamy, to which he said no. He said if he and I ended for some reason that had to do with him and I, he would consider not dating anyone else if they talked about it and agreed about things, but that he wouldn't ""stop"" being polyamorous or end his relationship with me just because she didn't want to date other people all the sudden.

Over the last 3 months this has escalated.

Meta has started being outwardly hostile toward me, and refusing to be around me. I swear to everything good in this world I have not done anything directly to hurt her, offend her, insult her, etc. Kindness is my RELIGION, and while I know I am a fallible human being, I try very hard to treat everyone with kindness and respect, and ESPECIALLY when I am in her home, I do my best to respect her and treat her with positivity.

Because she is wanting to move toward monogamy herself, she is suddenly viewing me as ""the other woman,"" so to speak. She has told Partner that she wants like 90% of his time, and that it still probably won't be enough. She wants him to not be with me now, but he has told her that an ultimatum would cause him to choose the person who did not give him the ultimatum. I know he's human, and so is she, and practice is different than plan. She isn't outwardly saying she doesn't want him with me completely, but she wants him to spend as little time with me as possible.

Over the last 3 months, she has forbade him from messaging me when he's at home (so I can only talk to him at work, while he should be focusing on work). We don't message constantly, so it isn't taking from the family in any tangible way to check in or send a meme once in a while.

She then went and got a second job, in addition to her full time one. She didn't need to get a second job, but said she wanted to in order to get a new car (she had 2 other cars, one in really good shape, neither of which she traded in). She told my husband she got the job because she just didn't want to be home. She keeps insisting on wanting all of my Partner's time, but isn't even at the house, since with her 2 jobs she leaves at 7am and doesn't get home until 10:30pm every day. She doesn't care if she isn't there, she wants him to give her ""time"" (ie - not spending time with me). It isn't about spending time with her, it's about not having time with me, talking to me, etc.

She has said she wants 90% of his time, as I mentioned (and said that still wouldn't be enough), which Parter has not agreed to since it would be changing the pattern we have had set up for 2 years, for no other reason than her just not wanting him to be around me. He and I talked about it and I made sure that he knew I loved our time together, but I would understand if he spent more time at home, and encouraged him to talk to her about a compromise. He mentioned to her that he'd be willing to spend more time at home (even if she's not there), if she'd let up on the messaging me when he's home, or even if she'd lessen the 6-8 week notice rule for any plans we want to make. She was furious and said absolutely not. She hasn't been willing to bend on anything or compromise.

Another thing that is going on is that Partner and I are affectionate people. We don't make out in front of everyone or anything but we'll sit together on the couch, hold hands, or a hand on the leg, etc. Nothing inappropriate, but closeness. She is NOT a touchy person, and never really has been, but it's gotten worse. He's realized how much affection means to him and how much he craves it. He's asked her to do simple things like sit on the couch with him instead of across the room in a separate chair, and she told him that she isn't that person and never would be. She would not sit by him, and didn't want to touch at all (hand on leg, holding hands, etc). Total rejection of affection. To everyone's knowledge, there isn't a trauma-based reason for this, but just her preference (which she is allowed to have, but is contradictory to what Partner needs in a relationship, though he's dealt with it for years and would continue to, because he loves her and wants to be with her for many other reasons).

Partner gave up some of our usual time together (at my insistence) to plan a weekly date for the two of them to have some dedicated one on one time. She has told him over and over that, she was, ""asking for miles, but he was only giving feet,"" and that the extra date time was a joke. Simultaneously, she INSISTED that he be home not one minute late to start that time together. This included her demanding we end an out of town trip early that we'd had planned for months, so that he could be home in time for their weekly date. Most of the time, when they would do something, would be eating lunch at home, or running errands. I think they actually went on a date like twice.

Partner asked her to go to therapy together to try to work on things, several months ago. She reluctantly agreed. Two therapists have told Partner that she is an angry person who probably isn't ready for therapy, or looking at herself or the relationship closely. She kept going though, and the therapist was great (I've heard just bits and pieces, but the consensus is that she has thought provoking questions for them, gives them reasonable homework, and helps mediate talking). Meta has been resistant to doing homework, and often clams up in therapy so that there isn't any talking on her part.

Separately, she has also said that both my husband and Partner are, ""too sensitive,"" and ""too nice."" She can be.... rough around the edges.

One issue over the last few months especially, is that she is rejecting any acts of love from my partner. For 19 years he's made her coffee in the morning and brought it to her, cooked for her and fixed her plate and brought it to her, maintained her vehicles, asked what she might need if he stood up, etc. Acts of love are a big way that he shows his love. She will outright refuse those things, and would rather go hungry than eat dinner that he brings her if I'm there. Even when I'm not there, she has started acting resentful if he does those things, and will often refuse them. ONE time he didn't bring her coffee, because he was distracted (and she'd rejected him dozens of times up to then too), and she acted like he'd just betrayed her, and cried and yelled and then wouldn't talk to him for days. He hasn't missed TRYING to bring her stuff even one time since, because he has been trying to show her every way he knows how that he loves her and cares for her.

This last therapy session (""ironically"" 2 days after he co-signed a new car with her), Partner told me that meta told the therapist she is just waiting on Partner to end it. It crushed him and he's been a crying mess since (3 days now). He did finally tell her he didn't think they had ever been able to love each other the way the other person needed, even though they loved each other. He told her he was done fighting since it didn't seem like there was any way things could get better, and that he didn't want them to continue just hurting each other. They had already discussed a what-if plan, aware that this might be coming. They will be staying in the house to care for the family together, share the financial responsibility, etc. The only thing that would practically change is where he is sleeping.

Over the last 3 months I have offered multiple times, sincerely, to back off so that he could work on his marriage, because it's important. I have not broken up with him, but I gave him multiple nudges to break up with me if he wanted to dedicate that time to his wife and give her what she wanted (though I was incredibly sad doing so, and would be more than devastated if we split up). I suggested it without any resentment in my speech or tone, and out of genuine concern for him. He has told me he doesn't want to give up a love that is so strong and enriching and meeting all of his needs, for a relationship where he is constantly rejected and generally, can't do anything right. Even earlier this week after their therapy session when he told me that she'd said that, I offered to back off again. He said no, and I have been letting him control that aspect of our relationship.

Last night she begged him not to leave her, and to stay sleeping in their bedroom, but he told her he didn't think he could do that (all the while sobbing because it's not really what he wants, but he doesn't know what else to do). She made quite a few comments that it has been very one-sided with her doing all the work to make the relationship work (she has been completely inflexible on anything, and has not done anything to contribute to the healing of the relationship). It's completely inaccurate, and it's another reason it feels to him like there isn't a way back to fix this, if she can't even acknowledge the situation they're really in. She has made it clear she will not treat him with love or compassion, or compromise in any way as long as he is with me. She says he is choosing me over her, even though that hasn't been what he's tried to do at all. She's pushed him into a corner.

So here's my question... AITA for following his lead and not just ending it so that it stops hurting her? If I'm not in the picture, I am assuming she MIGHT be willing to try to work on the other things (communication, love language styles, etc), but she isn't willing at all if I am in his life.

If you talk to anyone in the ""normal"" (non poly) world, the story she tells is that he won't leave his girlfriend even though she's begging him to, and then he ended their marriage. It sounds like infidelity and honestly I feel terrible because it's not what I want, or even what I want to be perceived as by her or anyone else. They haven't told a lot of people in their lives that they are poly, so when they separate, her story is going to be what they hear, and there won't be context to go with it. He doesn't deserve to be treated like an unfaithful husband.

No rush across crowded streets.  
No fateful bump.  
No spark under flickering streetlights.

You were just another number in my phone, until you weren’t.

It started quietly, almost accidentally, the way rain seeps into the earth. Before we ever took a single step toward each other, there were nights, countless nights filled with voices and messages. Calls that stretched past midnight, where the silences between our words felt as full as the words themselves. Texts that arrived like small gifts:

“Good morning”  
“I saw this and it reminded me of you”  
“Are you still awake?”

Sometimes we fell asleep mid-call. I would wake to your breathing drifting through the line, or you would wake to my half-formed “goodnight” echoing faintly. In the mornings, I dragged myself through work, coffee in hand, eyelids heavy, but even that exhaustion felt sweet. A secret only we shared.

In between the long nights and days came the little things. Pictures of food, “see this, your favorite” cheesecake, a plate of dumplings, chai, home-cooked meals, sent just because we thought of showing them to each other. 

And always, without fail, your reminder when the clock blinked 11:11:

“Make a wish.”

You never missed it. Not once.

Sometimes you’d ask, teasing but gentle:  
“Aren’t you tired after being in office working all day?”

And I’d laugh softly, answering:  
“Not tired enough to stop listening to you… not tired enough to miss this.""

Somewhere in between, you’d tell me to cut the call once I fell asleep.  
But I’d whisper back, “Stay with me a little longer?”  
And you would only hum in reply, a soft “hmm"" before your voice faded into a quiet, drowsy ""goodnight""

Somewhere in those hours, we began to make promises. Whispered plans spoken into the dark as though speaking to them aloud would make them real.

“When we meet, we’ll go to that little café first.""  
“And then… we’ll take a long walk?""  
“Yes. And I’ll count each step with you.""  
""A walk near the Beach?""  
""Definitely!""

And then, after a pause, your voice, smaller, uncertain:  
“We have plenty of time, don’t we?""

I smiled, though you couldn’t see it.  
“Time will never run short for us, ma'am""

Talking to you became more than a habit. It was a lullaby not because it put me to sleep, but because it made me safe. Your voice slowed the rush in my head. It dimmed the world’s noise. The weight of turning thirty soon didn’t feel so heavy anymore when you were on the other end of the line.

Before the first step, there was patience. It held us in its quiet arms. It let us grow familiar in absence. It turned waiting into care, and silence into intimacy.

And then, one evening, years later, in a crowded café, here we are.

No cinematic swell of music. Just you, sitting by the window, scrolling on your phone, a half-finished cup of chai beside you.

Me? Distracted by the way you tuck that stray strand of hair behind your ear, by the blink of your eyes, and by that million-dollar smile of yours…a smile that feels like a social service in itself. For a moment, time thickened.

You smiled faintly, guarded.  
“Yeah. It’s been…what, years?”

“Yeah, those nights?” I asked. “The calls that never ended. I used to wake up for office with just two hours of sleep.”

You teased back, but softly:  
“And still, you’d say ‘Not tired enough to stop listening to you’""

We sat. The air between us was full of things unsaid. Our eyes darted to our cups, the table, anywhere but each other.

We both smiled, but our eyes held something heavier.

“We had plans” I said. “That café you wanted to show me, the long walk by the beach…""

You interrupted gently, firmly:  
“We never took that step to meet then”

Silence. The weight of lost time settled.

“Now it’s just memories” you whispered, almost to yourself. 

“We moved on, didn’t we?”

I still wish that someday, maybe, those small promises will bloom. Until then, I carry your voice into my dreams, waking with the quiet certainty that even now, even after everything, time will never feel too little for us.

The noise of the café rose around us, cups clinking, spoons stirring. We sat as strangers who once weren't.

I turned away first, my gaze lost in the café's hum.  
“Time…” I said softly. ""It ran out after all, didn’t it?""",1,1759426840.0,u_kumar-abhinandan,0,1.0,False

I had a blood test scheduled for Monday morning. The nurse said, “Make sure to fast for 12 hours before.” Somehow, my brain decided she said 72 hours. I spent the entire weekend basically starving myself, sipping only water and black coffee.

By Sunday night, I was lightheaded, hallucinating about cheeseburgers, and convinced I was unlocking monk-level discipline. When I finally went in Monday, the nurse asked if I’d eaten dinner the night before. I proudly said, “Nope, haven’t eaten since Friday!” She looked horrified.

Turns out, I nearly passed out mid-draw because I had absolutely no fuel in my system. They gave me a granola bar like I was a fainting Victorian woman.

1nwaf1e,https://i.redd.it/zxcyjr25iqsf1.png,Saturday Office Visit,"The long, wretched New England summer was finally gone. It had been a season of sweaty regrets and *absolutely no* pantyhose—the kind of humid chokehold that made the idea of a foundation garment feel less like support and more like a sticky, personal betrayal. I had spent months postponing my outings as Paula, cursing the thermometer, because who wants to be *Paula* if Paula is just a melted, vaguely unhappy puddle of foundation and nylon?

But then, glorious, mercifully cool New England Autumn arrived. The air turned crisp, the kind of air that demanded wool, cashmere, and, yes, a good supportive bra. The world was shedding its green fatigue and bursting into outrageous, theatrical color. And if Mother Nature could be so shamelessly flamboyant in scarlet and gold, then I, too, could indulge my need for high drama—specifically, drama involving pink and lavender.

My wife, bless her consumerist soul, was safely miles away on an overnight shopping expedition, leaving me with a rare, glorious window of solitude. This was it. The heat was gone, the stage was set, and my wardrobe was ready. Paul was finally going to become Paula.

I spent the Friday night before, a ritual of quiet, careful selection. It’s an art, this choice of wardrobe. Too flashy, and you look like you’re starring in a community theater production of *Working Girl*; too dowdy, and well, what’s the point of the whole beautiful, terrifying exercise?

 I settled on Middle-Aged Mom Ready for the Office. It was a look that screamed ""competence and a sensible 401k."" Black pants, a lavender turtleneck, and jewelry so modest it practically apologized for existing. 

It felt so good to put on a bra—that crucial piece of feminine architectural engineering. It delivered a firm, benevolent embrace, a warm hug. An hour in, and I knew the elastic would be starting to assert its dominance, leaving faint, pink canyons across my back. The underwire poking, not maliciously, but with the steady, insistent reminder of its presence. It would be glorious. This minor, persistent discomfort—this was the true initiation. Every tiny, digging pressure point was a bond, a silent nod to the millions of women who, at that very moment, were also subtly adjusting a strap or shifting a band. It was a secret society whispered in polyester and spandex. I wouldn’t just endure the discomfort; I’d reveled in it, for it stitched me even closer to the very idea of Paula and the world I longed to inhabit.

Little did I know, this very ensemble—my carefully curated fantasy—was about to become my actual corporate uniform.

By 10 AM Saturday, I was ready, the very definition of suburban Mom, sensible, cuteness, it was a look that screamed, ""I own a minivan, volunteer at the school fair, and hinted at a secret knowledge of coupon clipping and low-interest mortgage rates.



I stood before the full-length mirror, and for a moment, I wasn't Paul, the man perpetually stressed about data packets and mortgage payments. I was Paula. It’s hard to explain to those who don't feel it, but the change wasn't just the clothes; it was the entire nervous system tuning to a different frequency. The heels, though destined to betray me later, gave me a new posture. The soft fabric of the turtleneck didn't just drape; it *fitted*. It was like putting on a suit of armor that finally felt like skin—a quiet, undeniable click of alignment. For the first time all week, the pieces of my world—the internal and the external—actually matched. I looked professional, capable, and, most importantly, completely, serenely female.



By 10 AM Saturday, I was ready, a picture of quiet, lavender-infused determination. I performed the Neighborhood Sneak, a maneuver requiring the patience of a saint and the timing of a Swiss watch. I waited for Susan, my neighbor, who possesses an almost supernatural radar for anything outside the suburban norm, to finally leave for her golf date. Safety secured, I slipped out, cinching my disguise with a pair of stylish, feminine sunglasses. The world was my oyster. The road beckoned.

Then came the familiar, irritating *ping* of my work email—a sound that, in my world, is the electronic equivalent of the scream. Network problems. A seminar in the UK, a continent away, was hamstrung because our beloved Gateway server had taken an unscheduled nap. I turned the car around, the lavender turtleneck suddenly feeling less like a statement of style and more like a uniform of doom. I tried to fix it remotely, furiously clicking and swearing under my breath, but the machine was being obstinate, its digital spine utterly rigid.

There was only one solution, a pilgrimage. I had to go *in*.

Now, the idea of going to the office as Paula, a persona I’d been meticulously crafting for years, would in the past actually have terrified me. But now I was teetering on the edge of retirement. What did I have to lose? A final memo? *(“creating an unwarranted air of glamour in the third-floor server room, thereby setting unrealistic aesthetic expectations for his colleagues."")*

A slightly less plush retirement cake? Most of my peers were gone, replaced by a younger, generation who viewed the GLBT community as mainstream. It was Saturday; the office would be a ghost town. And if by some miracle someone *was* there? Well, I’d love to see the look on their face when they saw this slightly overdressed, lavender-clad apparition. What the hell, I was going.

I wouldn’t let a downed server spoil my day out in Boston.

Back in the car I went, the high heels clicking a defiant rhythm on the asphalt. I pulled into the empty, sun-drenched parking lot, a glorious, long walk to the entrance. Laptop case and handbag over my shoulder—my ID card, with its male image of me, clipped to the turtleneck. *Snick-snack-snick* went the heels on the marble lobby tile, a sound that, for once, felt bold, not furtive. Card reader *click*, elevator, third floor.

I stepped out into the familiar, echoing reception area. David, the ever-vigilant security guard, was not there. I smiled at the camera that I knew was there. Card-swiped the final door, and I was in.

The problem, as is often the case with computers, was maddeningly simple. The fix was a matter of minutes: force the switchover to the backup server. Crisis averted. I walked over to my actual, *Paul’s* desk, an island in the corporate sea of cubicles. I sat down, a perfectly formed, lavender-and-black silhouette, and tapped my newly manicured nails on the keyboard. Just to savor it.

On my way out, pausing for a moment in the coffee room, I ran into one of our software engineers. If you work in high tech, you know this guy: the “Always There Guy”. Weekends, holidays, the dead of night—he’s a permanent fixture, subsisting on caffeine and code.

I smiled, a genuinely warm, feminine smile. ""Good morning,"" I chirped.

He mumbled something back, a noncommittal grunt that suggested he was either mid-equation or hadn't slept in 48 hours. He didn't blink. He didn't do a double-take. He didn’t even register that the person standing before him was the same man whose name was on the desk fifty feet away. To him, I was just another slightly eccentric co-worker grabbing coffee.

It was a small, wonderful victory.

The rest of the day was spent exactly as I’d planned: Boston. I replenished my makeup at MAC, had a lovely lunch at one of my favorite hotels overlooking the harbor, and soon enough, I was home. 

The true victory wasn't the functional Gateway server or the MAC eyeliner; it was getting my battered, blistered feet out of those heels and into a pair of fluffy, therapeutic slippers. The kind of slippers, I might add, that Paul would never have dreamed of owning, but that Paula simply couldn't live without. A truly perfect Saturday.

Life’s short, and honestly, why waste time on small talk when we could already be teasing each other about our questionable coffee choices or whose music taste is better? [or who tastes better ;)]

I try to stay somewhat fit, but my real strength? Being ridiculously easy to talk to. People say I’m approachable, empathetic, and the kind of listener who actually remembers the little things.

What I’m looking for: a woman (18+) who’s up for genuine conversations, playful flirting, and maybe even something spicier if we click. IRL meets aren’t off the table either. I don’t care if you’re an introvert or extrovert - just bring some energy to keep the convo flowing, and I’ll always match it.

One small heads-up: I will eventually ask for verification. Nothing dramatic, will not ask for any identifiable photo,  just a safety thing. I hope that doesn’t put you off.

In 2024 my longtime GERD began accelerating. Previously it was managed by omeprozole, but the intensity and frequency continued increasing at a rapid rate throughout the year; the reflux pains started feeling like heart attacks and could trigger panic attacks. I suspect that years of PPI's gave me SIBO, and that caused me to develop IBS-C, which caused me occasional gastroparesis (gastroparesis confirmed by Dr.). I was upped to pantoprozole maimum doesage twice daily, but it failed to help.

After stopping the pantoprozole for a BRAVO test in January, the heartburn became absolutely unmanageable. Every little thing quickly gave me intense heartburn, and the constant irritation in my throat caused a feedback loop. I was reduced to eating chicken breasts, quinoa and steamed veg, and yet I still dealt with heartburn constantly. I had trouble taking my medications, and I began to lose weight rapidly. Additional scopes showed my lower esophageal sphincter no longer fully closed.

In May 2025 I underwent a partial (toupet) fundoplication. Part of this choice was my father was diagnosed with Barret's esophagus in 2024, and underwent a successful nissian fundoplication in January 2025 to help manage his silent reflux. I saw no real options forward beyond surgery.

Post surgery, I suffered additional complications, including severe skin reactions, COVID, and ongoing bolus (food sticking) that could trigger retching; this was likely caused by post nasal drip caused by seasonal allergies, and the drainage could not pass through the wrap on its own.

It has taken me several months and one dilation, but I will say that I am back to 90% I was before 2024 onset. I am continuing to work with my medical team to understand the ongoing IBS-C, but I can eat most of what I want*, as much as I need✝, and my weight has begun to rebound.

By my and my surgeon's measure my fundoplication has been a success, and I would recommend anyone who is being given the opportunity to seriously consider it as an option. Do you due diligence, get secondary opinions, but don't automatically assume the negativity around here is reflective of the success rate. Truth be told, I unsubscribed from all of my gut-related subs once I started to feel better, as I suspect many do.

I decided I didn't want to contribute to the (non-) survivorship bias, and provide a bit of hope for those in the worst of it.

Feel free to ask any questions and I can try to answer as best as I can.

1nwa5s0,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1nwa5s0/dear_brian_niccol/,"Dear Brian Niccol,","You have ruined Starbucks, and I’m here to tell you why. 
I’ve been a partner for 14 months now and I can tell you that your presence and authority within the company has turned it into one of the biggest dumpster fires that capitalist America has ever seen. 
Let’s start with the problems. First up: the dress code. As a long time customer at many coffee chains and shops, I can say without a doubt that the amount of shits I give about what the barista wears is so miniscule, not even the Hubble telescope could see it. Customers do not care that we have matching black shirts and blue jeans, they see impersonal, burnt-coffee robots behind the bar and not the lively coffeehouse hosts you wish we were. Now onto the cup writing. I see the intent, and I applaud the effort to increase the friendliness and familiarity between partners and patrons, but must we do it by slowing down production time, enforcing silly guidelines about what we can write, and threatening our jobs if we do not live up to the good name of Shakespeare with every shaken espresso we craft? The cup writing increases the time needed to make a single drink, especially now that you’ve outlawed stars and smiley faces, however the ever increasing demand to bring down window times has not ceased. Why so many steps, Brian? What happened to parring down the menu, Brian? Why do you force us to make clumpy matcha, Brian? You claim that you can fix the company by shifting the coffeehouse culture back to its peak, but you fail to see that the culture around us is already telling you what they want. They don’t want a barista spoon feeding half-baked (and forced) social interaction to them in the lobby. They don’t want communal mugs and wooden chairs. They don’t want slimy, clumpy banana matcha lattes. They want efficiency, quality, and lowered prices. 
Some of my best moments working for Starbucks have been made by the imperfectness of the interaction. Despite the claim that we are in the people business serving coffee, you sure are missing the mark on meeting the needs of the people. Not everyone wants to chat, and not everyone needs a grinning barista. Sometimes they need someone to say “I’m sorry to hear that” when their mom passes away, or ""congratulations!"" when they finish their last round of chemo. Every interaction is and should be different. No person is the same, but there is something we all need: compassion. Good baristas (and people) give and receive compassion for the betterment of others, not the improvement of your stock prices. 
Now, out of the kindness and compassion of my heart, I’ll give you some pointers on how to please the public. Get rid of the Green Apron Host, everyone can see how disingenuous it is. Restructure the matcha so that it produces a quality beverage, instead of barf over ice. Stop threatening your partner's jobs over a doodle on a cup. Don’t close down stores and roasteries without notice and leave partners without a job. Don’t say you’ll downsize the menu and then add 20 drinks with the main ingredients being milk, sugar, and bullshit. Value your partners, let them express themselves, let them have organic and genuine connections without fear of termination. Take the stick out of your ass and try having empathy for those without private commuter jets. And once you’ve done all that, resign. 
I’m going to channel my inner perfect partner and apply the core values here. I will have the courage to stand up to you and tell you that the “work” you do to improve our craft only hurts it, the lack of positive results of your policies are because you don’t belong here, and it will be the most joyous day of my career to see you leave the company. 

Sincerely,
US********

The past few years I've been using a very poor cuisinart burr grinder, with the stock pressurized filter basket for my Delonghi ECP 3420. When I got my new grinder I also purchased a bottomless portafilter and unpressurized basket.   
I've been trying about a week or so now to get good shots but am having issues with constant sour shots.   
I dose 18g of coffee and have tried different grind sizes that yield me 36g between 25-35 seconds. They all taste wildly sour and undrinkable.   
The only way I've been able to get a halfway decent shot is to pull 50-60 grams which just seems way off.   
Coffee I'm using is counter culture, and it's delivered fresh so my recent delivery was roasted about a week ago.   
Just curious to what I can do here. I know my machine isn't the greatest but I'm sure theres something else going on.

1nwa4tn,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1nwa4tn/aita_for_begging_my_exhusband_to_take_me_back/,AITA for begging my ex-husband to take me back after I got pregnant during our 'break' and then lying that he abandoned me?,"I cheated on my husband during our ""marriage break"" and now he's completely cut me out of his life, and I think I deserve another chance.

I know how that sounds. But hear me out.

My husband and I were together for six years, married for three. Things got rough last year. We were arguing constantly, mostly about stupid stuff like dishes and whose family to visit for holidays. I felt overwhelmed. I told him I needed space to work on myself and suggested we take a break from the marriage.

He didn't want to. He sat at our kitchen table and said, ""We can go to counseling. We can figure this out together. Please don't do this.""

I said, ""I need time to think. I can't breathe in this relationship right now.""

He looked at me for a long time. Then he said okay. He moved into his brother's place that weekend.

The break was supposed to be three months. I told him we wouldn't see other people, just focus on ourselves. He agreed.

Two weeks later, I ran into my high school boyfriend at a coffee shop. We started talking. He was divorced, working in tech, looked good. We exchanged numbers. It felt innocent at first, just catching up. Then we started meeting for lunch. Then dinner. Then I slept with him.

I told myself it didn't count because we were on a break. My husband and I weren't technically together. I convinced myself I was allowed to explore my feelings.

It kept happening. Once a week, sometimes more. My ex made me feel excited again, like I did when I was seventeen. No responsibilities, no arguments about whose turn it was to clean the bathroom. Just fun.

Then I missed my period.

I took four tests. All positive. I was eight weeks along when I found out, which meant it happened right at the beginning of things with my ex.

I panicked. I called my husband and said, ""We need to talk. Can you come over?""

He showed up that evening. He looked tired. He sat on the couch, our couch, the one we picked out together at IKEA three years ago, and said, ""What's going on? Are you okay?""

I started crying. I said, ""I'm pregnant.""

His face changed. He looked confused, then hopeful. He said, ""Wait, what? How? We haven't been together in almost two months.""

I couldn't look at him. I said, ""It's not yours.""

The silence was horrible. He just stared at me. Then he stood up and said, ""You slept with someone else.""

It wasn't a question.

I said, ""We were on a break. You said it was okay.""

He laughed. It sounded wrong, bitter. He said, ""I said I'd give you space. I never said you could fuck someone else. Jesus Christ.""

I begged him to sit back down. I said, ""Please, we can work through this. I made a mistake. I want to fix our marriage.""

He said, ""There's nothing to fix. You destroyed it.""

I grabbed his arm. I said, ""Don't leave. We can go to counseling now. We can start over. Please.""

He pulled away from me and walked out. He filed for divorce three days later.

That's when everything got worse. I was devastated. I kept calling him, texting him, showing up at his brother's apartment. He wouldn't talk to me. His brother finally came outside one day and said, ""You need to stop. He's done. Leave him alone.""

My family asked what happened. I couldn't tell them the truth. I was so ashamed. So I said he left me when I got pregnant. I said he abandoned us. I cried to my mom and said he didn't want the baby, that he just walked away from our marriage without trying.

My mom was furious. She called him a coward. My dad wanted to confront him. My sister posted vague things on social media about men who run from responsibility.

His family found out what I was saying. His mom called me and screamed at me for twenty minutes. She said, ""You're telling everyone my son abandoned you? You cheated on him. You got pregnant by another man. And now you're lying about him?""

I said, ""I just needed support. I didn't know what else to tell people.""

She said, ""Try the truth,"" and hung up.

My ex, the baby's father, wanted to be involved. He was excited, actually. He started coming to doctor's appointments with me. That's when people started seeing us together. My husband's friends saw us at Target buying baby stuff. Someone saw my ex kiss me outside the clinic after an ultrasound.

Word spread fast. Suddenly everyone knew the real story. My family was horrified when they found out I'd lied. My mom said, ""How could you make us think he did that to you?""

I tried to explain that I was scared and confused and hormonal. She said, ""You're a grown woman who made a choice. Own it.""

The divorce went through. He didn't fight me on anything, just wanted it done. He took his stuff from our apartment while I was at work. He left his key on the counter. He blocked my number, blocked me on everything.

I had the baby four months ago. A girl. My ex is a decent dad, I'll give him that. He has her every other weekend. But I'm miserable. I'm a single mom living in a one bedroom apartment, working full time, exhausted constantly.

I see my ex husband sometimes around town. He pretends he doesn't see me. Last month I saw him at a restaurant with a woman. They were laughing. He looked happy. It killed me.

I told my sister I wanted to reach out to him again, to apologize properly and see if there's any chance. She said, ""Are you insane? You cheated on him, lied about him to everyone, and tried to make him look like a deadbeat. Why would he ever speak to you again?""

I said, ""Because we had something real. We were married. That has to mean something.""

She said, ""You're the one who decided it meant nothing.""

My family thinks I need to move on. His family won't speak to me. Mutual friends picked sides, and nobody picked mine. I'm completely alone in this except for my ex, the guy I cheated with, who honestly I'm not even that into anymore.

I know I messed up. I know I shouldn't have cheated. I definitely shouldn't have lied about my husband abandoning me. But don't people deserve second chances?

Am I really the only one in the wrong here, or did my husband give up on us too easily?

My wife thinks I’m just stressed out from work, that my mind is playing tricks on me. Maybe she’s right. Perhaps I am cracking under the pressure. But the problem with that theory is simple: I know what I heard.

And what I heard did not come from my daughter.

My daughter, Emily, just turned three in July. She’s bright, curious, and a little too clever for her age. She loves dolls, anything with sparkles, and has recently developed a terrifyingly accurate “puppy dog eyes” look that makes it almost impossible to say no to her. She’s also developed what my wife and I chalked up as totally normal at first: an imaginary friend.

We laughed about it when she first mentioned him.

“His name’s Mister Red,” she said one night during dinner, holding a chicken nugget across the table like she was feeding someone invisible.

“Mister Red, huh?” I chuckled, glancing at my wife. “What does he look like?”

Emily tilted her head like she had to really think about it, then said, “He’s tall. And his eyes hurt.”

Weird, yeah, but kids are weird. They say creepy stuff sometimes without realizing it. My wife said the exact same thing I was thinking probably something she picked up from cartoons.

However, over the next couple of weeks, Mister Red started showing up more often in Emily’s stories. She’d leave room for him on the couch. She’d ask me to buckle him into the back seat of the car. Once, I even caught her whispering into the crack of her closet door and giggling like someone had whispered back.

It was unnerving, sure, but kids need imaginary friends. We told ourselves it was just her way of working through loneliness or practicing her social skills.

Until the night the baby monitor crackled.

We still keep the monitor in her room, even though she’s out of the baby stage. It helps us know when she wakes up in the middle of the night or needs water. I’m a light sleeper, so usually I hear her before the monitor even kicks in, but that night I woke up to static.

At first it was faint—just a gentle hiss. I thought maybe the batteries were dying. Then I heard Emily’s little voice.

“Okay. But Daddy said no.”

I sat up in bed, rubbing my eyes. My wife stirred beside me, groggy but not awake enough to notice.

Then came the second voice.

It was low. Too low to belong to a child. The kind of voice that doesn’t sound like it’s coming from a throat at all, but from somewhere deeper, like it’s been dragged up from under the floorboards.

“He won’t know.”

My blood ran cold. I froze, staring at the monitor glowing on the nightstand. Emily laughed softly. “You’re silly, Mister Red.”

I don’t remember getting out of bed. I just remember standing in her doorway, my heart pounding so hard I thought it might burst out of my chest. She was sitting up in bed, blankets bunched around her lap, smiling at the empty corner of the room.

“Em?” I whispered.

She looked up at me, startled. “Daddy! Mister Red said a bad word.”

I flicked on the light. The room was empty. Just toys scattered across the floor, her stuffed bunny at her side, and the baby monitor on her nightstand, its little green light flickering like nothing had happened.

“Time to sleep,” I said, forcing calm into my voice. I tucked her back in and kissed her forehead, trying to ignore the way her eyes darted back to the corner.

As I left the room, I heard her whisper again, soft as a breath:

“Shh. He doesn’t like when you look at him.”

I didn’t sleep the rest of that night.

That was the first time I heard Mister Red.

And it wasn’t the last. The night I first heard Mister Red, I told myself I must have been half asleep, caught in that fog where dreams bleed into waking. But the more I tried to convince myself, the less I believed it.

Because the voice had weight. A presence. A voice that makes your bones feel hollow.

The next morning, I made coffee, stronger than usual and decided not to mention what happened last night to my wife. What would I even say? Hey, honey, I think our daughter’s imaginary friend is real, and maybe Satan?

Emily was chipper at breakfast, swinging her legs under the chair as she dunked her cereal spoon into the milk.

“Mister Red doesn’t like milk,” she said casually

I blinked. “What does Mister Red like, then?”

Her little face went serious. “He likes when people bleed.”

My wife nearly choked on her toast.

“Emily!” she scolded, setting her plate down with a clatter. “That is not a funny thing to say. Where did you hear that?”

Emily frowned, her lower lip wobbling like she was about to cry. “Mister Red told me.”

I caught my wife’s eyes across the table. She looked uneasy but forced a smile. “Sweetie, you can’t say things like that. That’s not… appropriate.” Emily’s shoulders hunched as she returned to her cereal, and that was the end of it—for her, at least. For me, the words rang in my head the rest of the day.

A week later, the monitor woke me again. This time, there was no mistaking it.

The static came first, but then I heard whispering. Low, insistent, too quick to make out. Emily’s voice responded, giggling, “Okay, but only if Daddy doesn’t find out.”

My skin prickled.

The other voice followed. Clearer this time. Closer.

“He always finds out. That’s why we’ll have to hurt him first.”

I shot out of bed, nearly tripping over the sheets. My wife groaned.

“What the hell, babe?” she mumbled, eyes still shut.

“Emily,” I muttered, already halfway down the hall.

When I opened her door, she was sitting upright again, her small face lit by the glow of the nightlight.

“Who are you talking to?” I demanded. She pointed at the corner of the room, the same corner as last time. “Mister Red.”

The closet door was cracked open an inch.

I slammed it shut without looking inside and scooped her into my arms. She squirmed and protested, but I carried her into our bedroom and laid her between me and my wife.

The next morning, I told my wife everything—about the monitor, about the voice.

She rubbed her temples, exhausted. “You’re working sixty hours a week, barely sleeping, and now you’re scaring yourself. Kids say weird shit all the time, it doesn’t mean it’s real.”

“I know what I heard,” I snapped.

She stared at me, hurt flickering across her face. “So what—you think something’s actually in there with her?”

I didn’t answer.

Because I did.

That night, I unplugged the monitor and put it in the drawer. I thought maybe if I didn’t hear it, it would stop. But Emily didn’t stop.

At dinner, she told us Mister Red “likes Mommy’s hair.”

During bath time, she asked if blood floats. And once, while coloring, she leaned close to me and whispered, “Mister Red says he can make me a new Daddy if you go away.”

I dropped the crayon I’d been holding. My hands wouldn’t stop shaking.

When I told my wife later, she shook her head. “You’re feeding into this. The more attention you give it, the worse it gets. Just ignore it. She’ll grow out of it.”

But that night, when I tucked Emily in, she said something that made my stomach turn to stone.

“Daddy, can you sleep with me tonight?”

“Why, Em?” I asked gently.

Her eyes darted to the corner again. “Because Mister Red says he wants to talk to you.”

I didn’t sleep a single minute after that.

I stopped trusting my own ears after that. Every creak of the house, every whisper of the furnace turning on, every sound from the monitor made me wonder if it was all just in my head.

I told myself it had to be stress. Long hours at work. Too much caffeine. Too little sleep. A bad combination for anyone’s mind.

But then there was Emily. She wasn’t just talking about Mister Red anymore. She was talking like him.

One morning I found her standing in front of the bathroom mirror, whispering. Her lips moved in sharp, jerky motions that didn’t sound like her voice at all—low, guttural noises, like a bad impression of an adult trying to sound “scary.”

When she noticed me, she smiled wide enough to show her gums.

“Mister Red says Mommy shouldn’t leave the house today.”

My skin crawled. “Why?”

Her smile twitched. “Because cars don’t stop fast enough.”

I didn’t let my wife drive to work that day.

She was furious with me, of course. Said I was becoming paranoid, overprotective. Said I was letting our daughter’s imagination control my life.

But she wasn’t there when I saw the look in Emily’s eyes. She wasn’t there when I felt that cold draft brush the back of my neck even though the windows were shut tight.

I started digging.

Late nights after my wife and daughter were asleep, I sat hunched over the glow of my laptop, searching for anything I could find. Maybe Mister Red was something I’d read about years ago. A story lodged in my brain that Emily overheard me mention. Something explainable. But what I found made me feel sick.

In the county records, our house had been sold twice in ten years. The previous owners left after just fourteen months. Before that, the family had stayed less than a year. No one seemed to keep it longer than that.

I found an archived local newspaper article, too—dated fifteen years ago. A child had gone missing from the house across the street. A boy, six years old. They never found his body. The mother claimed he’d been talking to someone she couldn’t see in his room at night. The paper didn’t use the words “imaginary friend,” but that’s what it sounded like to me.

The missing boy’s name? Caleb.

And in one grainy black-and-white photo, clipped from the article, the mother was standing on her porch. Behind her, in the shadows of the hallway, something thin and dark seemed to stretch along the wall. Too tall to be her. Too crooked to be a shadow.

I clicked off the screen so fast my mouse slipped from my hand.

When I brought all this to my wife, she just stared at me.

“Do you even hear yourself?” she asked. “You’re digging through fifteen-year-old newspapers looking for monsters under the bed. Do you realize how insane that sounds?”

“It’s not insane if it’s happening,” I shot back.

She pressed her hands to her face. “No. What’s happening is that Emily is picking up on your anxiety. Kids are sponges. You act paranoid, she’ll start acting paranoid too.” I wanted to argue, but just then Emily wandered into the room, dragging her stuffed bunny by one ear. Her hair was mussed from sleep.

“Daddy,” she said softly. “Mister Red says you shouldn’t talk about him. He doesn’t like that.”

Her eyes flicked to my laptop bag on the counter.

Then she smiled.

That night, I woke to a sound that made my stomach drop.

It wasn’t Emily’s voice.

It was a laugh.

Deep. Crooked. Filtered through static, spilling from the baby monitor like bile.

And this time, my wife heard it too.

She sat bolt upright beside me, clutching my arm, her face pale in the dark.

“Jesus Christ,” she whispered. “What the hell was that?”

I didn’t answer. Because I already knew. It wasn’t imaginary.

It was in the house.

After the laugh, nothing in our house felt the same.

It lingered in the walls, that sound. Even when the monitor was silent, I swore I could hear it echoing faintly in the pipes, or in the buzz of the fridge motor, or just under the scratch of my own breath.

My wife stopped calling me paranoid after that night. She didn’t admit I’d been right, but she didn’t have to. The way she double-checked the locks, the way she avoided the hallway to Emily’s room after dark—that was admission enough.

The first object moved two days later.

I came into the living room to find Emily’s stuffed bunny sitting upright on the coffee table. She was in her room at the time. My wife was in the shower. Nobody had put it there.

When I asked Emily about it later, she just shrugged. “Mister Red wanted to see if he could sit like me.”

The way she said it so casually made bile rise in my throat.

After that, little things started happening. Keys in the freezer. A drinking glass upside down in the middle of the hallway. My phone left in Emily’s closet, though I knew I’d plugged it in by my bed the night before.

And then the scratches started. Thin lines on the walls, on the backs of doors, across the wood floor. Too high for Emily. Too deep for a child. They weren’t words—not exactly—but sometimes they almost looked like shapes. Twisted stick figures. A circle with too many lines shooting out of it like crooked sun rays.

I caught my wife staring at one of them on the wall above our headboard one morning, her hand trembling as she traced the grooves. She didn’t say anything, but that night, she slept with the lamp on.

Emily changed too.

She stopped eating her favorite foods, but sometimes I’d find crumbs in her bed from things we hadn’t given her. Saltine crackers. Beef jerky. Things I knew we didn’t keep in the house.

Her voice would dip without warning—mid-sentence, like a switch being flipped.

One afternoon, while coloring at the kitchen table, she looked up at me with wide eyes and said in a gravelly tone that did not belong to her:

“Do you ever wonder how hot skin gets before it bubbles?”

The crayon snapped in my hand.

She blinked, then laughed, her normal little-girl laugh. “Daddy, you broke it!”

My wife took her into the yard after that, and I sat at the table staring at the broken crayon until I realized my palm was bleeding. The baby monitor became worse than useless. It was no longer just a tool—it was an open wound in the house.

Sometimes, I’d hear heavy breathing. Sometimes, a scraping sound, like fingernails dragged across a microphone. And sometimes, a voice that wasn’t quite Emily’s and wasn’t quite anyone else’s.

Once, it said my name.

Not “Daddy.”

Not “Dad.”

My actual name.

Drawn out in a wet, gurgling whisper that rattled the speaker until I thought it might burst.

That was the night my wife finally broke.

We both stood frozen in bed, staring at the monitor. The voice rasped my name again, long and slow. Emily giggled in the background.

Then, clear as day:

“Come upstairs, Joel. She wants you to see.”

My wife clapped her hand over her mouth to stifle a scream. I bolted down the hall, but before I even touched the knob, Emily’s bedroom door creaked open by itself. Just an inch. Just enough to show me that the closet door inside was standing wide open, darkness yawning out of it like a throat.

I slammed the door shut. I shoved a chair under the knob. And for the first time in my life, I prayed aloud, my voice cracking like a child’s.

Behind the door, Emily laughed again.

And something else laughed with her.

The next morning, my wife wanted to leave. Pack up, get a hotel, anything. But Emily cried and screamed like we were trying to kill her.

“Mister Red said we can’t leave yet!” she shrieked, her face red and twisted in rage. “He said it’s not done!”

Her voice dropped on the last word, and for a moment, her little body shook like a puppet yanked on invisible strings.

We didn’t leave.

Not yet.

Because the worst part wasn’t what Mister Red was doing to Emily.

It was that some part of me believed if we left… he’d follow. I didn’t want to dig any deeper. Every instinct in me screamed to get my wife, grab Emily, and burn the whole goddamn house down. But fear does strange things—it makes you hesitate, makes you want answers before action. As if knowing the “why” will somehow keep you safe from the “what.”

So I kept digging.

At the local library, I requested the microfilm records for our neighborhood. A hushed, fluorescent-lit basement, dust thick in the air, pages of brittle newsprint flicking under my fingers.

And there they were.

Not just Caleb—the missing boy from across the street. There were more.

1978: Local child, Rebecca H., disappears from her bed. Police suspect abduction. No leads.

1989: Toddler, Michael R., found dead in his crib. Cause of death undetermined. Parents reported “strange activity in the home” prior to incident.

1994: Two sisters, ages four and six, claim “the red man” visits them at night. Parents institutionalized for child neglect after insisting the figure was real.

Different names, different decades. Always children. Always houses within a four-block radius of ours.

And in every article, the parents were quoted describing the same thing: A friend.

A voice at night.

A presence in the room that didn’t belong. One article made my stomach turn to ice.

2007: Local man found dead by self-inflicted wounds. Note recovered: “I tried to keep him away from my daughter. He wants the young ones. He always has.”

The man’s name was Daniel Cooper. He lived in our house.

I sat there for hours, photocopying everything with shaking hands. Names, addresses, dates—all pieces of the same pattern.

When I brought the stack home, my wife flipped through it with wide, horrified eyes.

“Jesus Christ,” she whispered. “It’s the same… over and over.”

Her hands trembled as she set the papers down. “Why didn’t the real estate agent—why didn’t anyone tell us?”

“Because they don’t put ‘haunted by child-murdering demons on the disclosure form.”

She shot me a look, but I could see the fear in her face mirrored mine.

Emily found us later that night, hunched over the dining table with the papers spread out like evidence in a trial. She climbed into a chair and peered at the photocopied articles with curious eyes.

“Those are Mister Red’s friends,” she said softly. My wife stiffened. “What do you mean, sweetie?”

Emily tapped one of the clippings with her finger—Rebecca’s obituary. “They still play with him. In the closet.”

Her little face brightened with a grin too wide for comfort. “He says soon I can go with them too.”

My wife ripped the papers away like they were poison, shoving them into a drawer. Her voice shook as she told Emily it was bedtime.

But the look on my daughter’s face… it wasn’t disappointment.

It was anticipation.

That night, after Emily was asleep, I pulled the baby monitor out of the drawer and set it on the nightstand. My wife glared but didn’t stop me.

Static. Soft breathing.

And then—whispers.

Dozens of them. Children’s voices, layered and thin, overlapping like radio signals crossing each other.

And under them all, deep and steady, that same voice that had haunted me since the first night.

“He keeps them,” it said. “They never grow. They never leave. Soon, she will join them.” The monitor popped and hissed like something wet inside the speaker.

My wife turned her face into the pillow, sobbing.

I sat frozen, unable to move, and unable to breathe. That night was the breaking point.

I woke from my trance to Emily screaming. Not crying, not having a nightmare—screaming. Her voice tore through the house like glass shattering. My wife and I bolted down the hall, fumbling for the light switch.

The bulb popped the moment it flicked on. Darkness swallowed us whole.

Emily’s door slammed shut before we reached it. We threw ourselves against it, but it wouldn’t budge. From inside came laughter—not hers. Low, guttural, rolling like thunder too close to the ground.

“Open the door!” my wife screamed, pounding her fists raw against the wood.

Then Emily’s small voice, muffled:

“It’s okay, Mommy. He’s almost done making me new.”

I swear to God I felt something move past me in the hall. Not running. Gliding. A brush of heat against my arm like a furnace exhaling. My wife whimpered.

The monitor on the nightstand flicked to life on its own. Static surged, and then a dozen voices spilled through at once—children whispering, overlapping, crying. And underneath them, steady and deep:

“She’s mine now.”

The door flung open before I could kick it down. The room was wrong.

The air was heavy, like breathing through wet cloth. The closet door was wide open, and the darkness inside wasn’t the absence of light—it was thicker, like tar. Shapes shifted within it, small outlines of children pressing at the edge but never crossing. Their eyes gleamed like marbles sunk in mud.

Emily stood at the threshold, her hands outstretched toward them.

My wife screamed her name.

That’s when I saw him.

Tall. Red—not blood red, not crimson, but the raw, blistered color of burned flesh. Limbs too long, joints bent backward, his face a smear of shadow with two pits where eyes should be.

And he was crouched low, one skeletal hand hovering over Emily’s shoulder.

I didn’t think. I just ran forward, grabbed her, and yanked her back. The hand snapped closed where she’d been a second before, claws raking through air.

The sound he made when she slipped from his reach—God, I’ll never forget it. Like rusted metal grinding against itself. We ran. We didn’t stop to pack, didn’t stop to look back. We carried Emily out of the house in her nightgown and drove until the sun rose.

We’ve been staying at a motel for two days now. Emily barely speaks. When she does, it’s nonsense—half-formed sentences in that guttural tone that doesn’t belong to her. My wife won’t sleep without every light in the room on.

And me?

I thought maybe we’d escaped.

Until tonight.

Because the monitor is glowing again. Sitting on the dresser across from me.

I never brought it here.

It shouldn’t even exist anymore—I broke it into pieces and left them behind.

But it’s here.

And the static is rising.

And now, under it, I can hear Emily’s voice.

“Daddy, he says you can’t keep me forever.” If anyone reads this—please, if you’re house hunting, if you have kids—check the history. Look for the names.

And if your child ever whispers about a man called Mister Red—

get out before he comes for you too.",3,1759425805.0,nosleep,1,0.8,False

1nw9xnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1nw9xnm/why_wont_my_machine_build_pressure_after_moving/,Why won’t my machine build pressure after moving? [Sage Barista Express],"Hi everyone,

I’ve got a Sage Barista Express that I bought new in 2022 (not second-hand, I’m the first owner). It already survived one move and worked perfectly fine afterwards. But I’ve just moved again, and now it suddenly won’t build pressure anymore.

The machine still runs water through the puck, but there’s basically no resistance and no pressure showing on the gauge. The result is just hot brown water – no proper extraction at all.

I thought maybe it was just the beans (I used a different bag this time), but I switched back to my usual beans, tried finer grind settings, tamping harder, etc. – nothing changes. Still no pressure buildup.

Could it be that a gasket or seal got damaged during the move? Water does flow and coffee is coming out, but it’s just watery and thin with no pressure behind it.

Has anyone experienced this before, or knows what to check first?

Thanks a lot!

Compared to a year ago, 47% of Americans say that groceries are harder to afford, 34% say about the same, and 19% say easier to afford.

Overall inflation for food has been elevated but not particularly extreme, clocking in at 3.2% for the 12 months ended in August, per Labor Department data.

Prices for certain staple items many people consume nearly every day have risen much more than the average, including ground beef (up 12.8% in the past year), eggs (up 10.9%) and coffee (up 20.9%).

**Trump Approval on Inflation/Economy**

8 in 10 Americans say they believe the president has ""significant influence"" over the U.S. economy, but just 47% say the Trump administration has had a positive impact on the economy this year.

37% of Americans feeling stuck or behind say the current government is most responsible for their situation (20% of Republicans, 38% of independents, 48% of Democrats). The rest are split, with about 32% each between blaming businesses (41% R, 31% I, 26% D) or personal decisions (39% R, 31% I, 27% D).

Inflation on food prices (and gas prices) were at the center of the 2024 election, and a major losing issue for Democrats. Is Trump starting to inherit that responsibility, too? During the Biden administration, many supporters said that the President does not have a switch that makes prices cheaper, but messaging can be impactful to help voters feel seen. Will Trump learn Biden's lesson? Or will he continue to state that the US is in a ""golden age""?

Trip meant it when she told Myshuno she would run away with her! And her escape plan worked!

Unfortunately Junior also meant it when he told her she was going to the monastery, which delayed their plans somewhat.

When Trip came home for the weekend they made their move!

Trip met up with Myshuno at the Sixam fueling station, and together they teleported back to the starseed. She had to wait around for Myshuno to find an opportunity to sneak out of the teleporter so they got to the fairy realm when the sun was rising.

“Hey look, Myshuno! That’s my house!”

“Wow it looks so cozy! Are you sure you want to do this?”

“Yes! I want to see the world with you!”

 From there they teleported to the Forgotten Grotto, a secret cave in the desert.

They walked around a little and looked at the bats, before trying on their human disguises.

Myshuno’s disguise is obviously a very big difference from how Trip is used to seeing her. She got a little self conscious.

“Is it good?”

“Yeah! You look great! I mean you look like a human!”

“A pretty one?”

“Yes!”

“But you prefer me as me, right?”

“Absolutely!”

“Okay.”

“Yeah, you got this girl! Thumbs up! What do you think of mine?”

“What?! Trip! It looks like exactly the same!”

“Yeah! Haha.”

After that they were hit with the harsh reality of sleeping rough and bathing in the river… 

But they made it! This is the human world! It’s so human-y!

Over the next week they started doing everything they could to earn money for a place to call their own. 

Trip started hosting guided mediation in the park and Myshuno did a lot of fishing. She also finished the treehouse so they could sell their tent and start sleeping in the treehouse… she added all the upgrades cause … well really cause I wanted the park to look cute, and the slide is cute! Also it got her handiness really high! It only took a few more school projects to max it.. and that helped counter act the fact neither of them were going to school! So yea. Myshuno ended up being responsible despite being a teen runaway! Props to her!

All the while Trip’s family members kept showing up to check on her or try to get her to come home. Grandma Dewdrop was the first and she was as so proud of her for being a rebel! Grandma Dewdrop just gave her a hug and went on her way.

Grandpa Kyle took her out for a coffee. She told him not to worry. This was her choice. Her and Myshuno wanted to see the WORLD! The whole thing, not just the safe easy parts.

Grandpa Kyle gave her a big hug and told her to be safe.. but her dad showed up the next day.. so CLEARLY Grandpa talked to him!

Junior was furious. Myshuno just stood there awkwardly trying to make polite introductions to her father-in-law to be (let’s face it these girls are gunna get married, I was thinking it, you were thinking it, the girls were thinking it).  But  it was too much and Trip called them an Uber and got them out of there!

A couple days after that, their relentless grind for cash paid off! They bought their very own RV and dubbed it the Green Machine!!! 

Trip got all sentimental and gave Myshuno a promise ring. They just barely had time to make a cake and blow out the candles before they aged up with the sad “no one remembered my birthday” moodlet. No one wants that! 

The oven wouldn’t work tho so it was real touch and go… But the sun came out and the power came on and they made it! They made the money needed to buy their own mobile home before becoming adults and that was the primary goal. They have proven to themselves that they can make it on their own!

Even though their new home doesn’t look like much now, they have big dreams for it!

They are adults now, with a roof over their heads, a roof on wheels! Look out world! Trip and Myshuno are coming!

…as soon as they get enough money together for the gas to make the trip…

So I woke up at 3 o’clock in the morning, I think, having to go to the bathroom. I mean, I have to do this virtually every night. What I didn’t realize at the time is that part of the reason I woke up was because I was having massive anxiety, and I couldn’t for the life of me figure out the reason why.  

Previously in the day, one of my coworkers had been showing me this really cool new stuff that he had built at work. It was just really impressive. And then he told me that our boss’s boss had mentioned how cool this was — and this is the same guy who had previously demoted him and also not given me a promotion and stuff like that.  

For some reason, this kept repeating itself in my head — not that part, but the part about what he had done, this cool thing that he had built, which I absolutely loved — but it gave me massive anxiety and I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why. So I kept laying in bed, trying to go back to sleep, telling my brain, *“This is ridiculous. What this guy did is super cool. You don’t have to have anxiety about it.”*  

So, clearly, it’s about something else, but I can’t for the life of me figure out what that could be.  

This keeps happening though — this anxiety thing — where for me it feels like something spinning around in my stomach, like a circle inside of my stomach, spinning around. That’s how I know when I’m about to have a bad day, essentially. I can, many times, get over it by starting to perform actions.  

Instead of sitting and having a cup of coffee for a long period of time, reading news and looking out the window, kind of waking up, if I just go to work and go to the gym — which I almost always find helpful — it can calm me. Sometimes I find people to talk to at the gym and we’ll talk, obviously, small talk about random stuff that doesn’t really matter. Those things are really helpful for keeping my anxiety at bay.  

But sometimes it just doesn’t help. And I don’t really know what to do about it. I haven’t had it for so long — I’ve only had it for a few years. And, of course, it’s in your head because it’s anxiety, but a lot of times I’ll have anxiety about things that haven’t happened and are not likely to happen. So it’s essentially completely made up.  

There is, of course, probably some sort of underlying reason for all of this. I know initially, at least in my therapy sessions, it had to do a lot with understanding fear and shame — which are things that I’m not very comfortable with. I’m not sure if anybody’s comfortable with shame, but I was definitely not comfortable with fear, which would instead come out as anger. Whenever I was afraid, I would get angry.  

So today I’m battling all these thoughts about that and trying to understand how to decode what happened in the middle of the night. There might not really be anything to do or say, but… yeah, that’s it.

1nw9s1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/employmenttribunal/comments/1nw9s1c/being_managed_out_of_my_company_is_this/,"Being managed out of my company, is this disability discrimination?","Hi everyone, I really need some outside perspective.

I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2021 and disclosed it to my employer in Jan 2025 after starting my job 10 months ago, (England) Since then, I’ve had a really rough time at work and I feel like I’m being treated unfairly.

In the past 3 months I have been called into two separate disciplinary hearings. First disciplinary allegations included being late twice when I had just moved house, smoke break outside during a conference break, using my phone during a panel, and notifying sick days before 9am instead of 8:30 when there was no sickness policy (which they insisted there was and had to come back to me to say there wasn’t). Most of these were dropped after I rebutted the points due to the fact a colleague acted identically to me and wasn’t issued a warning, . The only outcome was a written warning for being “uncontactable” one morning (I was super ill without being TMI and let them know late and apologised).

I was told then that they would give me adjustments for my ADHD but only after getting disciplined, but the “adjustments” offered were things like a suggestion to use sticky notes, check my diary in the morning, AI note taker (never got this) but I also asked for the team to be aware if I forget things here & there its not due to incompetence as this is one of my most challenging symptoms but I’ve been trying my hardest to stay on top of everything.

I then got a second disciplinary last week because I was 13 minutes late replying to messages on Teams and subsequently missed a non urgent deadline by 20 minutes  (my laptop was glitching + I was on DND). It also mentioned that I forgot to follow up one email and made small typos in a draft (which is super common at my job bc it’s so fast paced and my colleagues’ typos and missed follow-ups have never led to disciplinaries and I’m usually the person who fixes these ).

It also said I forgot to book in a coffee meeting that was a month away and wasn’t originally my task and when I called in sick I messaged the wrong person by accident to let them know.

This time around everything was dropped again after I rebutted the points and reminded them about my reasonable adjustments and I believe they contacted a lawyer who advised them to drop it all. I filed a grievance this time because it feels a bit ridiculous, I mean first time typos = misconduct?? but because the company is so small they would essentially be investigating themselves so I want to just take it to ACAS but I’m currently gaslighting myself into thinking that maybe I actually did do misconduct.

But the fact they are hiring currently the goalpost for misconduct keeps being lowered all of a sudden and the disregard for the “reasonable” adjustments  make me think they are finding pretextual reasons to fire me

From the outside, does this sound like clear discrimination/harassment to you? & should I escalate? Or am I overthinking it?

Right now the thought of going back honestly makes me so anxious",1,1759425263.0,employmenttribunal,5,0.6,False
1nw9s0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1nw9s0z/trick_or_treat_down_memory_lane/,Trick or Treat Down Memory Lane,"Have you ever wished to go back? Even if it was just for a short while? I’ve seen many collapse under the weight of reality and instead choose the comfort of rose-colored glasses. It’s strange how we accept language for what it is and rarely question its origins. Take idioms, for instance—we use them every day with carelessness, never respecting their weight or power. I hear you hurl them into the void, not realizing how close you are to unveiling a path not meant to be traversed. These phrases are warnings, but you say them anyway: “dancing with the devil,” “skeletons in the closet,” “a shadow of one’s former self.” I won’t even speak of the hell you toy with when you say that last one.

But perhaps I’m being too harsh. Maybe your urge for nostalgia is simply too strong to ignore. Before we continue, remember: the past isn’t always what it seems. If this is truly what you desire, who am I to stop you? By saying “take a stroll down memory lane,” you clearly know what you’re inviting. So, I’ll tell you how to get there.

It’s funny how words lose meaning. We bastardize language, commercialize it with phrases like “trick or treat.” But I don’t blame you, not entirely. Long before costumes and candy, there was a ritual where one would stroll through town on Samhain—what you now call Halloween—to get lost, to forget, to embrace the past. Nostalgia isn’t some TikTok fad. It’s a drug craved for thousands of years. And on this stroll, it’s said true peace can be found. Many have taken the walk, though few return. Those who do are transformed. I remember one, I believe his name was Mahatma, who came back changed—a champion of inner peace. Or maybe his rose-colored glasses were simply fixed permanently.

So, if life feels too bleak, I’ll teach you the ritual. I’ll teach you how to stroll—or better known, how to trick or treat down Memory Lane.

Like any Halloween night, your first step is to wear the right costume. But you can’t choose a fad or something new. It must be a costume from your past. It doesn’t matter how long ago—only that it’s the same. The street only accepts what has been. And trust me, you don’t want to stand out for the others to notice.

Once dressed, head to any neighborhood alive with trick-or-treaters. I’m not sure why, but the presence of youth draws out the street’s magic. Step into the crowd and look closely. Through the chaos, you’ll notice a pattern, an energy, a current. If you can’t see it, I’m sorry—the street won’t welcome you. Maybe your longing for the past isn’t strong enough. Or maybe you still have more future than history.

But if you do see it, walk against the flow. Move away from stragglers. The street only accepts one at a time. Keep to the darker roads, and at every corner, stop to look at the street sign. Most pass them without noticing. When you reach the corner marked Memory Lane, pause. Ask yourself if this is truly what you want. The past is rarely what you remember… but if you must, take the step.

The street will feel strangely familiar, but I promise—it’s not a place you’ve ever walked before. Stay on the sidewalk. Do not stray from the path. Your senses will lie to you, begging you to embrace the past fully. Resist. Do not run, do not cause a commotion. You don’t want to draw attention. They don’t like outsiders. Visitors are never welcomed.

 

Take your time. Try to turn back if you want—you won’t find the way out. When you’re ready, approach the first house you see. It doesn’t matter which one. But once you choose, you must visit each house in order. No skipping generations.

Each house contains a half-decade of your life. You won’t relive events, but you will feel them. I hope your past is one worth remembering. When you reach the first house, you’ll see a candy dish and a sign: Please take one. And you must only take one. A lifeline can only be experienced once. Do not steal another’s memory.

The candy melts like warm milk on your tongue, flooding you with the sensation of being held. It tastes of plastic toys and soap bubbles. Every bite feels safe—until you realize you’re too small to step off the porch alone. Leave quickly, before someone offers to help with your first steps.

Laughter surrounds you at the second house, but none of the voices belong to children you remember. Don’t speak to them. Let them have their fun. The candy here is sharp, like chalk dust and playground gravel crunching between your teeth. It reeks of school glue and sweat-soaked costumes. Don’t linger. And don’t try to trade candy—they’ll beg, but you can’t.

The third house feels awkward. Judging you. Every sound echoes like whispers in a cafeteria, but you can’t make out the words. Still, you know they’re about you. The sour candy bursts with the taste of metallic braces and scraped knees. Your jaw aches, your hands are coated in sticky residue, like locker handles and cheap perfume. Go ahead take another piece. All the cool kids are doing it.

If you’ve made it to the fourth house, congratulations. Adolescence is a cruel filter. You’ll see reflections of yourself in the windows—don’t stare. They’ll look younger, disgusted. No one likes the old guy at the party. The candy burns bitter, like cheap beer and cigarette smoke, but you crave it. Swallowing is a chore. It tastes of late-night drives and unanswered texts. Keep walking. As they say, nothing good happens after midnight.

The fifth house feels plain, stripped of identity. Inside, you hear your own voice rehearsing lies: “I’d be a great fit for this role,” or “I’m fine.” The candy crunches into shards that cut your tongue. The taste shifts between coffee and blood, then fades into medicine, dirt, ash, expired sugar. Black gaps form. Lost years. Keep moving. You’re almost there.

At the final house, your senses are exhausted. Nostalgia is never as sweet as you remembered. There is no candy left. Just as your parents warned: too much will spoil your soul. The house stands undecorated, silent, the light closing in. There’s no choice now. Approach the door. Knock.

Don’t try to speak—your mouth is raw. When the door opens, a man will greet you. Do not meet his eyes. They are impossible to focus on anyway. Just listen.

If he says “trick,” I’m sorry. You’ll fade into the street like an unspoken wish. I’ll try to remember you.

If he says “treat,” congratulations. Turn around, and you’ll find yourself back among the trick-or-treaters, the night nearly over. From that moment on, life will feel peaceful. Don’t bother looking forward anymore. Just enjoy your nostalgia.",1,1759425262.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I figured I’d share some highlights since this could actually affect all of us:

* **Staking rewards taxation**: They discussed changing how staking income is taxed. Right now, you get hit twice: once when you receive it (as income), and again when you sell it (capital gains). This could be changed so you’re only taxed when you actually sell, which would be a huge improvement.
* **1099 reporting:** Starting in 2026, Coinbase and other exchanges have to report ALL our capital gains and losses to the IRS via Form 1099-DA. Coinbase's VP said ""the IRS is probably unprepared today to endure or absorb the amount of information that Coinbase alone will be providing."" That's... not reassuring lol.
* **Making crypto taxes less of a nightmare**: If you've ever moved crypto between wallets and tried doing your taxes manually, you know it's an absolute mess. You basically need CoinLedger or similar crypto tax software, or you're spending hours in Excel hell trying to track everything. They talked about simplifying this whole process.
* **De minimis exemption for small purchases**: Senator Lummis has been pushing to make small transactions under $300 tax-free (for example, buying coffee with Bitcoin). This seems pretty common sense and could actually help with real-world adoption.

Honestly, pretty encouraging to see these issues getting discussed. The small transaction exemption especially seems like a no-brainer if we want crypto to ever be used widely by normal people. ",4,1759425164.0,CoinBase,3,1.0,False

\----

Alright Morty, listen up.

We’re doing this Q&A style because linear thought is a scam invented by Microsoft Teams—probably while Bill Gates was arm-wrestling a malfunctioning Roomba.

TL;DR

Last-minute Multiverse Mayhems are like surprise boss fights in Dark Souls, except you spawn naked in a porta-potty during a clown convention, armed with a single flip-flop that's haunted by the ghost of your ex's bad decisions, a rusty spoon that's secretly plotting world domination, and a depression so thick it could curdle a black hole's tears.

\# Me vs. Chaos: the multiverse edition

\- What is chaos?

Chaos is entropy drunk on tequila shots laced with quantum uncertainty and the tears of forgotten sock puppets.

It’s your fridge freezing your butter into a tiny dairy iceberg while microwaving the milk into a sentient yogurt rebellion, like some kind of butter-vs-milk Thunderdome war crime officiated by a deranged cow in a judge's wig.

It’s Zoom deciding your microphone is now your toaster, mid-call, so you're belting out quarterly reports while your sourdough emerges buttered and screaming in binary.

It’s life, but coded by interns who majored in interpretive dance and minored in summoning eldritch horrors via Excel macros.

\- How do humans handle chaos?

Like raccoons in a Walmart that's been possessed by a flock of hyperactive pigeons high on expired energy drinks.

Step 1: panic-buy 47 rolls of duct tape and a unicycle, convinced it'll solve everything.

Step 2: rearrange sticky notes like you’re summoning productivity demons from the ninth circle of Hell's junk drawer, only for them to unionize and demand better lighting.

Step 3: pretend everything’s fine while your soul evaporates through your eyeballs, leaving behind a puddle that smells suspiciously like regret and half-eaten tacos.

Basically: imagine Marie Kondo possessed by Cthulhu, who’s also allergic to joy, yelling “DOES THIS SPARK JOY OR JUST EXISTENTIAL DREAD?” while flipping a table that's actually a portal to a dimension of infinite paperwork.

\- And stress, what’s up with that?

Stress is that smoke alarm at 3 AM that’s like “HEY, HEY, WAKE UP, YOU’RE GONNA DIE—OR WORSE, MISS YOUR DEADLINE!”

But half the time it’s just dead batteries plotting a coup with your smoke detector's evil twin. So you’re standing there in your underwear that's unraveling like a bad plot twist, holding a cat that's mid-hiss at an invisible laser pointer, clutching a baguette that's somehow caught fire from sheer willpower, screaming at the ceiling like a Renaissance painting of a saint wrestling a flock of caffeinated flamingos.

That’s stress.

And me? I try to dodge it by prepping like a doomsday prepper who's convinced the apocalypse will be triggered by rogue autocorrect suggestions. Because juggling grenades in a Zoom meeting is only fun the first time—after that, it's just your eyebrows singed and your dignity filed under ""extinct species.""

\- And “stealth” Multiverse Mayhems?

Oh, buckle up, buttercup—this one's a fever dream scripted by a caffeinated squirrel on bath salts.

Imagine an orchestra pit that's actually a black hole disguised as a bingo hall. The conductor busts in, no pants, pantsless as a philosophy major at a job interview, holding a Subway sandwich that's unionized and demanding better bread rights, and just screams:

“OKAY GUYS, PLAY WHATEVER, THE UNIVERSE IS WATCHING—AND IT'S JUDGING YOUR TEMPO WITH A SIDE OF COSMIC SHADE!”

The violinist? Dropping sick rap bars about existential violins while freestyling a symphony for a one-man mosh pit of invisible ghosts.

The drummer? Hammering out the Dora the Explorer theme song at 200 BPM, but remixed with whale calls and the sound of a thousand tiny hammers building a Dyson sphere out of expired yogurt lids.

The pianist? Pretending to lag like \*“uh… buffer… can’t… play… oh wait, is that a polka for quantum squirrels?”\* while actually composing an opera about his keys' secret love affair with the sustain pedal.

And me? I’ve got a triangle that's cursed to only ding on the off-beats of reality, plus crippling existential dread that's manifesting as a tiny, judgmental hamster on my shoulder whispering stock tips from the afterlife.

That’s a last-minute Multiverse Mayhem. Pure, unfiltered bedlam served with a garnish of ""why me?""

\- Why is this a problem?

1. People leave more fried than McDonald’s hash browns that've been deep-fried in a volcano of regret and served with a side of ""I need therapy"" sauce.
2. You drag in 50 people, 47 of them could’ve stayed home watching anime about interdimensional cat burglars, but nooo, now we all suffer together like a bad group chat that's evolved into a sentient eldritch entity demanding blood oaths over emoji reactions.
3. It makes us look like absolute clowns. And not even cool clowns—like, Party City clearance bin clowns that are half-melted from a tragic encounter with a rogue hot glue gun and smell faintly of broken dreams and bargain-bin face paint.

\- So what’s the fix?

Oh, radical concept: \*\*preparation\*\*, Morty—like building an ark before the flood, but instead of animals, you're herding agendas, deadlines, and that one guy who always shares cat videos during crises.

Step 1: give people roles BEFORE chaos starts, like assigning ""Chief Hamster Whisperer"" or ""Duct Tape Diplomat."" Wild, I know—almost as revolutionary as inventing pants.

Step 2: real communication channels. Not a 40-person Zoom where everyone’s mic is on and it sounds like a medieval plague market crossed with a chainsaw orchestra and a flock of geese debating quantum physics.

\- Why isn’t the current system enough?

Because I’m still ranting like a malfunctioning prophecy machine churning out the Dead Sea Scrolls of Stress, etched on napkins stained with the blood, sweat, and tears of a thousand un-caffeinated Mondays. If it worked, I’d be blackout drunk on a beach somewhere, wrestling a palm tree for its coconuts while a choir of seagulls sings my praises in pirate accents.

\- The ultimate solution?

The \*\*Anti-Chaos Brigade™\*\*, baby—picture it: black ops squad in matching jackets embroidered with ""Entropy's Worst Nightmare,"" armed with walkie-talkies that say “roger roger” but actually broadcast motivational quotes from a sassy AI that's part Yoda, part Gordon Ramsay.

When a Multiverse Mayhem detonates like a piñata full of angry hornets and overdue invoices, they kick down the ceiling tiles (which are suspiciously made of Jell-O), drop in with the Mission Impossible theme remixed for theremin and bagpipes, and neutralize entropy before anyone spills their coffee—or worse, their soul—into the abyss.

No more pigeons in panic mode, flapping like feathered conspiracy theorists at a flat-earth convention. No more chaos bingo, where ""mic feedback"" is the free space.

Just chaos ninjas, baby. Smooth. Silent. Deadly efficient.

The kind of people who could fix the universe while sipping a frappuccino with extra whip, a dash of unicorn tears, and a sprinkle of ""we got this"" fairy dust—then high-five a black hole on the way out.

1nw9oss,https://i.redd.it/4bbkfbz0eqsf1.jpeg,The Day I Stopped Loving Him,"Chapter 1
An explosive scandal rocked New York University when a video of Josephine Reynolds's first intimate night was leaked to a group chat.
The video was filmed in a presidential suite of a five-star hotel.
In it, Josephine was naked, pressed against the floor-to-ceiling window by a man a head taller than her, the sound of their movement echoing nonstop.
When it ended, the man leaned close to her ear and said, ""Good girl.""
The two words hit the group chat like a ton of bricks and instantly caused a huge commotion.
""That voice... Could the man be Nathaniel?""
""Josephine is so scheming. She actually hooked up with our school's board director! No wonder her bullies have backed off.""
""I always thought Josephine was a sweet, innocent girl. Turns out she's a calculating slut. Well, she's the daughter of a mistress after all!""
When the news reached Josephine, she was in her dorm, knitting a scarf for Nathaniel.
Her roommate cranked the volume to the maximum. With a smirk, she passed her phone around and spoke in a slow, deliberate drawl.
""Josephine, that's some practiced moaning. You must do this a lot, huh?""
Mocking laughter rang in Josephine's ears. She froze, her face pale. The half-knitted scarf slipped from her hands as she stood and rushed out.
She stumbled her way toward Nathaniel's office, demanding answers.
But just as she reached the door, she heard mocking voices from inside.
""Nathaniel, you really didn't show any mercy to Josephine, did you? You made her face so clear on purpose so she couldn't even explain herself.""
Josephine was stunned, coldness spreading through her body.
""She deserved it. She messed with Dorothy, the woman Nathaniel loves the most.""
""I just feel bad for Nathaniel. He's been through so much—hiring people to spread rumors that Josephine's mom was a mistress, dealing with those who bullied her to gain her trust, and even putting on an act of affection toward her.""
""Oh, right, Nathaniel, when do you plan to tell her the truth? If she finds out the man she's been in love with all this time is actually her future brother-in-law, she'll probably cry her heart out. The thought alone is hilarious.""
Lounging on the sofa, Nathaniel slowly tapped his cigarette against the ashtray's edge, his face an impassive mask.
As he remained silent, one of his buddies asked, ""Feeling pity for Josephine? She's the reason Dorothy has been suffering for two long years, exiled so far from home. You can't just let her off the hook!""
Hearing the name ""Dorothy,"" Nathaniel finally reacted.
He ground out his cigarette and said flatly, ""I'll tell Josephine the truth the day Dorothy returns.
""That day happens to be the anniversary she has been waiting for. I'll give her a 'surprise' and make her pay back everything she owes Dorothy.""
Josephine's breathing hitched, and her eyes fell on Nathaniel's stern face through the smoke. She felt as if a big hole had been opened in her heart, and the pain made her vision go black.
So the rumors about her mother had all been spread by Nathaniel!
He had pursued and protected her just for revenge.
The one he truly loved was her half-sister, Dorothy Reynolds.
Josephine couldn't take it anymore. She turned and ran away in panic.
But before she got far, a few girls blocked her path.
""Well, well, if it isn't the star of that exciting video!""
""You just came out of Mr. Gordon's office. Did you go offer yourself up again?""
Face pale, Josephine tried to escape but was shoved back and forth by the group.
Just then, Nathaniel's cold voice came from behind them.
""Bully her right in front of me? Do you have a death wish?""
He had walked out of his office unnoticed and was walking toward them.
The girls instantly fled.
Nathaniel came up to Josephine and fixed her messy hair. When he bent down to meet her eyes, his fingertip brushed gently across her cheek.
""I told you, if anyone bothers you again, you tell them you belong to me.""
The familiar scent of cigarettes filled Josephine's nose, making her eyes sting.
As the countless memories of his protection replayed in her mind, a hazy, dreamlike feeling washed over her.
After her mother's suicide, her father, Edward Reynolds, got back together with his first love, leaving Josephine to live a life far worse than an orphan's.
Soon, a rumor swept through the school: Josephine's mother was a mistress, and Dorothy was the rightful heir of the Reynolds family.
As ""the mistress's daughter,"" Josephine naturally became a target for bullying.
It was Nathaniel who came to her rescue. Using his authority as a board director, he shielded her effortlessly, providing a warmth she desperately needed.
Yesterday was Nathaniel's birthday. The two of them, drunk, crossed the line. He, usually so gentle and dignified, pressed her against the floor-to-ceiling window, admiring her trembling body.
The moment he slid in, a deep sense of solace settled over Josephine, like a lost bird finding its way home at last.
Little did she know, this had been nothing but a trap.
Josephine felt her mind spin.
When she came to her senses, she found herself settled into the passenger seat of Nathaniel's car.
Chapter 2
Nathaniel leaned in as he always did to buckle her seat belt. Seeing her eyes red, he spoke softly, ""The video was an accident. I'll find someone to deal with it. You're not in good shape today. I'll take you home to rest first.""
Josephine pressed her lips together. Thinking of what he had said in the office, her tears flowed uncontrollably.
Nathaniel froze for a moment, then reached up to wipe her tears. As if remembering something, he opened the car door. ""Wait for me a bit, I'll go buy something.""
When the door closed, Josephine realized Nathaniel had taken the wrong phone.
His phone was sitting in the slot by the armrest. Without knowing why, Josephine picked it up and entered Dorothy's birthday.
The phone unlocked. At the top of his chat list on WhatsApp, she saw Dorothy's name.
In their most recent chat, Dorothy asked him to cut ties with Josephine before she came back.
Nathaniel replied, ""Just a plaything. I was never with her.""
Josephine's heart sank suddenly. Fighting the sting in her nose, she kept scrolling.
In the two years Dorothy was overseas, Nathaniel called her every night at eight o'clock.
That was the time he had said he had board meetings, when Josephine must not disturb him.
On top of that, he transferred Dorothy tens of thousands every month—so fast he didn't even leave a note.
Dorothy was good at acting cute, often sending selfies to ask for praise. Nathaniel replied with pet emojis Josephine had never seen, telling her not to wear too little and to stay warm.
Looking at these chats, Josephine finally realized she had never really understood Nathaniel.
The gentle care he showed her was only a tiny piece of the love he had for Dorothy.
When Nathaniel came back to the car, there was now a box of morning-after pills in Josephine's hand.
Nathaniel gently patted her head, his voice soft as ever. ""Last night was too rushed; I didn't prepare. Take this, just in case.""
Josephine's fingers dug into the box, her lips bitten so hard they nearly bled.
If she hadn't overheard him earlier, she might still believe he was truly thinking of her.
But now, she was wide awake.
When the car stopped in front of the villa, Nathaniel leaned in as usual to kiss her goodbye. But Josephine turned away, fumbling to unbuckle her seatbelt.
His eyes darkened. He pulled her into his arms.
""Still upset because of the video?""
""...""
""The video wasn't recorded by me. The hotel manager has already been fired."" Nathaniel tilted her chin up. ""Josephine, I never wanted to hurt you, and I never will. Our anniversary is coming up soon. I'll make it up to you then.""
A white lie disguised as kindness is often more hurtful than the truth.
Josephine's nose stung. She pushed him away. ""I'll go inside first.""
She almost ran into the villa.
But the moment she stepped in, she bumped into Edward.
His face was dark. Before she could speak, he raised his hand and slapped her hard.
""Josephine, I really underestimated you. Date if you want, but to record that kind of shameless video? You've ruined my reputation!
""No wonder those people at your school targeted you. You're so filthy you attract flies!""
After shouting, Edward threw a plane ticket at her.
""I booked you a flight in seven days. Go as far away as you can and never come back!""
Josephine picked up the ticket from the floor, her fingers trembling, as if it were a sentence declaring the world had abandoned her.
Edward thought she was disgraceful and wanted her gone.
Fine. She didn't want to stay anyway.
""I'll leave,"" Josephine said flatly. ""I will listen to you and never come back.""
Edward froze, thinking he had misheard.
Back then, when he arranged for Dorothy to study abroad, he had urged Josephine to go too. But she refused, and after pressing her, he found out she was deeply in love.
He thought she would refuse again.
He never expected her to agree so quickly this time.
Only then did he ease a little, his voice cold.
""Dorothy is coming back this weekend. I'm hosting a party for her. You'll attend too.
""The video has already spread. If you don't show up, it'll only make the rumors worse.""
Josephine nodded. ""Got it.""
***
Josephine asked the school for three days off.
In those three days, she packed up everything Nathaniel had given her and listed them online at the original price.
Three days later, Dorothy returned.
Edward held a party for her at the biggest hotel in New York, inviting all the big names in business.
Nathaniel was among them.
Josephine hadn't expected to see him there. She turned to leave, but Nathaniel grabbed her wrist and pulled her into a quiet corner.
He pinned her to the wall, hands braced firmly on her sides, his hot breath brushing her ear.
""You skipped school these past days, didn't answer my messages, and even ignored our anniversary.
""Josephine, do you know how worried I was about you?""
Chapter 3
His eyes locked on her, clearly unhappy with her loss of contact.
Josephine pressed her lips and forced herself to meet Nathaniel's gaze. ""So you're worried about a meaningless sex partner?""
Usually obedient and compliant, Josephine suddenly got angry, which surprised Nathaniel.
A flash of defiance rose in him. He yanked Josephine close and wrapped his arm tight around her waist.
""Sex partner?
""It only happened once in two years. You call yourself a sex partner?""
Josephine didn't know why Nathaniel suddenly went mad, and he grabbed her chin to kiss her.
Just then, a voice came from nearby.
""Nathaniel, so you're here. Dorothy's been looking for you.""
Nathaniel frowned slightly, released Josephine, and said to that person, ""Got it. I'll be right there.""
Josephine acted surprised and asked Nathaniel, ""You know my sister?""
""More than just know her. Their relationship is more intense than you think,"" Nathaniel's friend said mockingly, ""Josephine, you're in for a big surprise.""
After they walked away, a hint of scorn flashed in Josephine's eyes.
They thought she was still in the dark and wanted to put on a show to shame her.
But they didn't know she had already sorted out her feelings and planned to cut Nathaniel off for good.
During the party, the lights suddenly went out.
In an instant, a spotlight hit the stage, and Nathaniel, wearing a suit, and Dorothy, wearing a white dress, appeared in front of everyone.
Edward smiled and raised his hand for silence, then announced loudly.
""I invited everyone here today to welcome Dorothy home after completing her studies abroad, and to share some good news.
""The Reynolds and Gordon families have been close for years. They arranged an engagement between Dorothy and young Mr. Gordon long ago.
""Now the two are in love. The engagement party will be held at the end of the month. Please come witness their happiness!""
When Edward finished, Nathaniel's friends looked at Josephine, waiting to see her break down.
But Josephine simply stood quietly among the crowd, her expression calm, as if everything on stage had nothing to do with her.
Nathaniel frowned.
In his plan, Josephine would lose control when she learned about him and Dorothy.
But she was unnaturally calm now.
A restless feeling rose in him for no clear reason. Dorothy noticed his oddness and quickly asked, ""Nathan, what's wrong?""
Nathaniel casually withdrew his gaze. ""Nothing. I just got distracted.""
He knew well that Josephine loved him deeply and couldn't possibly have no reaction.
She was only forcing herself to stay strong.
***
Josephine went to the restroom and splashed her face with cold water.
Thinking back on her old longing for Nathaniel, she felt utterly foolish.
No wonder he had touched her only once in two years.
It wasn't because he treasured her. He simply couldn't be bothered to touch her.
And the first night she had cherished was just perfect material for him to ruin her reputation.
When Josephine returned to the banquet hall, Edward called her over.
""Josephine, come say hello to your future brother-in-law.""
Josephine walked up to Nathaniel and put on a perfectly measured smile. ""Hello, Mr. Gordon.""
At the word ""Mr. Gordon,"" Nathaniel's face tightened.
Dorothy didn't notice and smiled brightly. ""Josie, I just heard Nathaniel is a board director at your school. What a coincidence. If you ever have trouble, you can ask your brother-in-law for help. We're family after all.""
Josephine clenched her teeth and said slowly, ""I won't want to trouble my brother-in-law.""
She didn't look at Nathaniel, but she could feel his cold gaze, and it made her shiver.
After some small talk, Josephine prepared to leave.
Dorothy stepped forward, looped her arm through hers, and pretended to be affectionate. ""Josie, it's been so long. I have so much to tell you.""
She dragged Josephine into the lounge without asking.
As soon as the door closed, Dorothy dropped her smile and turned icy.
""Josephine, I heard you slept with Nathaniel, and the video is everywhere. Do you think you can win his heart with such despicable means?
""Here's the truth: he never liked you. Not only did he not like you, he hated you!
""It was me who had him spread the rumor that your mom was a mistress. I told him to pursue you. I wanted to watch you fall for him bit by bit and then have him destroy you with his own hands!""
Chapter 4
Josephine asked, ""Why?""
""Why? Of course, because you have no self-awareness. Your mother has been dead for years. Why are you still hogging the Reynolds family's things?
""Those things were supposed to be mine. You, the mistress's daughter, have no right to enjoy the Reynolds family's wealth!""
Josephine could endure anything except her mother being insulted.
She rushed at Dorothy and squeezed the words out between her teeth.
""My mother wasn't a mistress. When she married Dad, she didn't even know you or your mother existed.
""You and your family pushed her to death!""
Dorothy hadn't expected Josephine to snap back and raised her hand to slap her.
At that moment, the lounge door suddenly swung open.
Out of the corner of her eye, Josephine saw Nathaniel's figure. Dorothy panicked and quickly grabbed the nut pastries from the table and shoved them into her mouth.
The next second, she collapsed and mumbled, ""Josephine, why did you force me to eat this? I'm allergic to nuts...""
Nathaniel rushed to Dorothy and shoved Josephine aside.
Josephine stumbled back and hit the coffee table hard.
With a crash, the cups on the table shattered. Glass cut Josephine's hands until they bled.
Nathaniel didn't even glance at her. He knelt and held Dorothy.
""Dorothy, are you okay?""
Dorothy's eyes filled with tears. She grabbed Nathaniel's arm helplessly. ""I only wanted to catch up with Josie. I don't know what I did to offend her. She suddenly forced me to eat those pastries...
""Look at me. Do I have a rash?""
Nathaniel looked down and saw red rashes spreading across Dorothy's skin quickly.
""What do we do? The party isn't over. I can't embarrass you. Makeup... right, use makeup to cover it!""
Nathaniel gripped Dorothy's wrist. ""This is not the time to think about makeup. Come on, I'll take you to the hospital.""
He lifted Dorothy into his arms and, as he left, shot Josephine a cold look.
Josephine forced herself up through the pain. Blood flowed from her hands and quickly stained her dress.
But she felt no pain, as if she had fallen into an abyss and all her senses were gone.
She asked a waiter for a first-aid kit and, trembling, wrapped her wounds.
After that, Josephine was exhausted and prepared to leave with heavy steps.
She had just reached the corridor when several figures lunged out and dragged her into a storage room without warning.
A large hand gripped her chin and forced her head back. Highly concentrated chili water was poured into her mouth.
Josephine's eyes widened in terror.
Like Dorothy, she had allergies. She was naturally allergic to chili.
That much chili water could kill her.
""Ugh... stop...""
Josephine struggled wildly.
But the attackers gave her no chance. Cup after cup of chili water was poured down her throat.
She choked until her face flushed and her body convulsed uncontrollably. Her injured hands scraped the floor weakly, making a sickening sound.
Instead of stopping, they insulted her even more fiercely.
""Dorothy is Nathaniel's beloved. How dare you touch her! Don't you know your place?""
""I heard you got bullied at school and have probably been used by so many men. Nathaniel would never want a filthy woman like you.""
""Drink all this chili water. Consider it your apology to Dorothy. Or else we'll make you pay!""
Josephine's vision blurred, and her mind began to drift.
She forced out the last of her strength and muttered almost without thought, ""Nath...""
Before she finished, harsh laughter rang above her head.
""Hahaha! You really expect Nathaniel to save you?""

I might be spending a lot more time in your wonderful city: I’ve been here for a couple of days now and it seems clean, friendly, really pretty in the sun and generally a great place to be/hang out.

Coming from slightly more edgy cities like London, I feel like Frankfurt has an undeserved reputation for being ‘boring’ (read: safe and functional). So my question is, where would one go for the slightly edgier, creative, interesting, hipster Frankfurt that I’m sure exists? As a fake hipster myself I thought that would be interesting to see.

I’m thinking artisan coffee, fixed gear bikes, dingy skater bars, good international food and weird pop ups. Anyone that’s been to Brixton/Peckham/Camberwell in London or Brooklyn in New York will know what I mean. So far I’ve explored a bit of Bahnhofsviertel and it definitely seems to have some of that.

Thanks in advance, and danke for having an amazing city! ",1,1759425036.0,frankfurt,8,0.57,False

TLDR; I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2021 and disclosed it to my employer in Jan 2025 after starting my job in December last year and was not offered adjustments until I received a first warning. Since then received 2 disciplinaries for things like taking a smoke break, typos in one post, forgetting to send an email etc 

In the past 3 months I have been called into two separate disciplinary hearings.
First disciplinary allegations included being late twice when I had just moved house, smoke break outside during a conference break, using my phone during a panel, and notifying sick days before 9am instead of 8:30 when there was no sickness policy (which they insisted there was and had to come back to me to say there wasn’t).
Most of these were dropped after I rebutted the points due to the fact a colleague acted identically to me and wasn’t issued a warning, . The only outcome was a written warning for being “uncontactable” one morning (I was super ill without being TMI and let them know late and apologised).

I was told then that they would give me adjustments for my ADHD but only after getting disciplined, but the “adjustments” offered were things like a suggestion to use sticky notes, check my diary in the morning, AI note taker (never got this) but I also asked for the team to be aware if I forget things here & there its not due to incompetence as this is one of my most challenging symptoms but I’ve been trying my hardest to stay on top of everything. 

I then got a second disciplinary last week because I was 13 minutes late replying to messages on Teams and subsequently missed a non urgent deadline by 20 minutes  (my laptop was glitching + I was on DND).
It also mentioned that I forgot to follow up one email and made small typos in a draft (which is super common at my job bc it’s so fast paced and my colleagues’ typos and missed follow-ups have never led to disciplinaries and I’m usually the person who fixes these ).

It also said I forgot to book in a coffee meeting that was a month away and wasn’t originally my task and when I called in sick I messaged the wrong person by accident to let them know. 

This time around everything was dropped again after I rebutted the points and reminded them about my reasonable adjustments and I believe they contacted a lawyer who advised them to drop it all. I filed a grievance this time because it feels a bit ridiculous, I mean first time typos = misconduct?? but because the company is so small they would essentially be investigating themselves so I want to just take it to ACAS but I’m currently gaslighting myself into thinking that maybe I actually did do misconduct.

But the fact they are hiring currently and the goalpost for misconduct keeps being lowered all of a sudden and only for me and the disregard for the “reasonable” adjustments  make me think they are finding pretextual reasons to fire me and that it could be discrimination 

From the outside, does this sound like clear discrimination/harassment to you? & should I escalate? Or am I overthinking it?",0,1759425003.0,LegalAdviceUK,35,0.42,False

1nw9n1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nw9n1u/what_makes_the_waterdrop_wdf2_filter_review_stand/,What Makes the Waterdrop WD-F2 Filter Review Stand Out for Home Improvement Enthusiasts?,"The Waterdrop WD-F2 filter is a replacement designed for the WD-X8-Basic & WD-X8-Alkaline, WD-X12-Basic & WD-X12-Alkaline, and WD-X16-Alkaline systems. Having incorporated this water filter into my daily life, I’ve had an in-depth look at the ins and outs of its functionality, and I’ll admit, a few aspects surprised me—both positively and negatively.

**Design and Build Quality**  
As someone who can’t stand fiddling with complicated replacements, I appreciated the straightforward design of this filter. Its dimensions (3.35""D x 3.35""W x 15.5""H) strike a good balance between being compact enough to fit snugly under the sink while housing a robust filtration system inside. The pre-sediment and carbon block material not only feels sturdy but also appears designed for longevity. The accordion pleats are an interesting touch; they increase the surface area for filtration, and I could tell there’s some real thought behind the design. The neutral color makes it blend seamlessly with my existing setup.

**Performance and Filtration Efficiency**  
After setting up the filter, I was genuinely impressed by the 5-stage precision filtration. It includes layers like the activated carbon and a scale inhibitor, effectively targeting contaminants such as chlorine, odors, salts, and sediment. My tap water had a noticeable improvement in taste, a sort of crispness that’s hard to pinpoint unless you’ve been thirsting for truly clean water. What’s more, the alkalizing mineral layer is a bonus for those needing alkaline-enhanced hydration. I’ve noticed even my coffee tastes subtly better, which might just be placebo—or might be the real deal.  

[Grab Waterdrop WD-F2 on Amazon now.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0cq4n9zp9/)  

**Ease of Use and Installation**  
I can confidently say that ease of use is one of this filter’s major upsides. The quick 3-second replacement feature saves so much hassle. No tools, no stress, just twist, replace, and twist back. The automatic water shut-off mechanism during replacement deserves a nod too. I was able to carry out the installation without accidentally soaking my sleeves, something that’s a common occurrence for someone with clumsy tendencies like me!  

**Highlights**  
- Easy installation with an automatic water shut-off feature.  
- Alkaline mineralization enhances the water quality.  
- Efficient 5-stage filtration handles a variety of harmful substances, including chlorine and sediment.  

**Limitations**  
But of course, no product is perfect. There are areas where the filter doesn’t meet everyone’s expectations. For starters, while the 6-month longevity is commendable, it can feel slightly underwhelming compared to competitors that stretch out to a year. On top of that, although the flavor of my water improved, the filter’s performance in heavily contaminated water wasn’t dramatically different from other high-end filters I've tested. Lastly, the premium quality means it’s not the cheapest option if you're shopping for filters on a budget.  

**Critiques**  
- Slightly shorter lifespan compared to alternatives, needing bi-annual replacements.  
- Limited standout performance for users with heavily contaminated water sources.  

**Challengers**  
When comparing this to other competitors in the market, like Brita or APEC filters, the WD-F2 holds its ground on ease of installation and filtration stages. However, Brita offers slightly more affordable options, though they lack the 5-stage precision filtration. APEC filters, on the other hand, come with a longer lifespan but fall short in providing the alkaline mineralization layer, which could be a deciding factor depending on personal preferences. If alkaline water is not a high priority, APEC might be a practical rival in terms of cost-efficiency.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
This filter slots into the premium category, and for what it provides, it truly feels like an investment rather than an unnecessary splurge. The 6-month lifespan pushes me to consider if there could be better options for the cost. That said, its top-tier certifications from IAPMO, SGS, and compliance with NSF/ANSI standards guarantee its quality, and this alone makes the product worth a second look. Clean water with minimal replacement effort makes it a valuable purchase for anyone juggling a busy lifestyle.

1nw9fpn,https://www.sevendaysvt.com/news/google-maps-routed-these-afghan-truckers-through-canada-then-ice-detained-them/,Google Maps Routed These Afghan Truckers Through Canada. Then ICE Detained Them.,"'On September 5, Enayetullah Walizada, a commercial semi-truck driver from Afghanistan, picked up a load of cookies in New Hampshire and plugged his destination — Union, Calif.  — into Google Maps.

He soon found himself approaching the international border near Derby Line, Vermont, realizing too late that his route was taking him through Canada. The snafu may cost him his shot at a life in the U.S.

When Canadian border officials turned Walizada back, he had to pass through a U.S. Customs and Border Protection checkpoint. Despite his pending asylum case and valid work permit, border agents detained him, claiming his legal status in the country had expired days earlier. He is now being held at Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans, fighting deportation.

Walizada is not the first Afghan trucker to be ensnared in President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown at the Vermont-Canada border.

In June, another Afghan semi-truck driver transporting Vermont coffee made a wrong turn while following directions from Google Maps and approached the border. Though the driver had been granted asylum in the U.S. in 2023, border officials detained him.

He was held in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody in a Vermont prison for 10 days, and was released after pressure from the Vermont Afghan Alliance and several attorneys. The government never filed any charges in immigration court to justify his detention, his lawyer said.

“The trend we’re seeing with Afghan truck drivers who are working to get American goods from point A to point B is deeply concerning,” said Molly Gray, executive director of the Vermont Afghan Alliance. “In this case, these truck drivers are lawfully in the United States. They often supported U.S. military and diplomatic missions in Afghanistan and are working to rebuild their lives here.”

Many Afghans whose wives and children remain abroad have chosen to work as truck drivers in part because the main downside of the job — long stretches of time away from home and family — is already their reality, said Gabriel Espinal, Walizada’s immigration attorney.

“In this case, that led to this really unpredictable and almost absurd situation, where through a completely honest, innocent mistake of just taking a wrong turn, all the sudden he wound up in detention where he’s been for weeks now, at a literal prison, as if he committed some type of crime,” Espinal said.

Walizada, 29, came to the U.S. in August 2021, and was granted humanitarian parole through Operation Allies Refuge, a program that evacuated Afghan allies during the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. troops. He applied for asylum in 2022 and has been awaiting the government’s decision on his case. He lives with relatives in Oregon, but his wife and children remain in Afghanistan. 

“It’s been a really long and painful four years,” Espinal said. “While he’s been waiting for his asylum decision, he’s made a provisional life in the U.S., all with the goal of reuniting with his wife and kids.”

After Walizada drove his truck up to the border, Customs and Border Protection agents detained him at the port of entry for six days before he was transferred to the state prison in St. Albans, according to court records.

Espinal attempted to contact him in detention, but was rebuffed by immigration officials for days.

“We’re seeing systematic efforts by CBP and ICE to prevent access to legal counsel both at the border and in ICE facilities run by the Vermont Department of Corrections,” said Gray of the Afghan Alliance. 

Customs and Border Protection did not respond to a request for comment.

The government is arguing that Walizada’s humanitarian parole — a temporary status granted during the Biden administration to give Afghans time to apply for asylum — had expired days before he approached the border, leaving him without legal status in the country. Customs and Border Protection agents then had him sign a Notice to Appear, the first step in starting deportation proceedings.

Walizada’s attorney said he has a strong asylum claim that he expects will be approved. But the timeline for receiving a decision from the government is impossible to predict, and Walizada has already been waiting several years.

“He’s been doing everything the government has asked him to do for his asylum case,” Espinal said. “He’s gone through the whole process and is just waiting for a decision.”

On September 16, Nathan Virag, an immigration lawyer at the Association of Africans Living in Vermont, filed a habeas petition for Walizada in federal court, arguing that his detention is unjustified and requesting that a federal judge grant his release.

An oral argument hearing is scheduled for October 7. A separate hearing on Walizada’s deportation proceedings, called a “master hearing,” is scheduled for two days later before an immigration judge.

“It’s so unheard of, like what’s going to happen at the master hearing?” said Virag. “We’ll say, ‘Your honor, he’s already applied for asylum and has been waiting for a decision for a year and a half. He’s just waiting for a decision from the government.’”'

I am in need of some advice as to providing ventilation for some Mockernut Hickory nuts I am presently stratifying.

I am using Iowa State's guide on the matter, and have followed all the steps as described (I will include screenshots of the relevant text).  However, just below the entry on hickories is another on Buckeye seeds, which includes all of the steps for hickory nuts PLUS providing ventilation by poking holes in the bag/container.

So I'm left with the question: Is poking holes for ventilation a standard practice that simply wasn't mentioned in the steps for Hickory nuts, or is it something that they do not need?

Many thanks in advance.

*Where the 76ers’ hopes are as shaky as a Jenga tower in an earthquake, and the Knicks strut in like they own the desert.*

---

**Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Teams**  
Let’s start with the numbers. The **New York Knicks** are favored at **-8.5** on the spread (Bovada) and **-6.5** on DraftKings, with a total of **219.5** points. Converting their moneyline odds (1.25 at Bovada) gives an implied probability of **71.4%**—a staggering edge for a preseason game. Meanwhile, the **Philadelphia 76ers** are priced at **+3.75**, translating to a **21.3%** implied chance to win. That’s like giving a toddler a slingshot and betting they’ll take down Goliath.

Why the lopsided line? The Knicks are coming off a deep playoff run, with a healthier roster and a new up-tempo system under coach Mike Brown. The 76ers? They’re missing **Joel Embiid** (knee surgery) and **Paul George** (same), their two most reliable weapons. It’s like sending a toaster to a barbecue contest—*present, but useless*.

---

**Digesting the News: Injuries, New Blood, and Coach Speak**  
The Knicks are a well-oiled machine, integrating stars like **Jalen Brunson**, **Karl-Anthony Towns**, and new acquisitions **Jordan Clarkson** and **Malcolm Brogdon**. Think of them as a luxury SUV: smooth, loaded with features, and ready to dominate the open road. Coach Mike Brown’s “up-tempo” style? More like “up-and-out” for the competition.

The 76ers, meanwhile, are a work in progress. Without Embiid and George, they’re relying on **Tyrese Maxey** (a human highlight reel) and rookie **VJ Edgecombe**, who’s making his first non-Summer League appearance. Oh, and **Jared McCain** is returning from injury, which is a plus but not a party. It’s like building a house with one hand tied behind your back and the other holding a cup of coffee—*chaotic, but not caffeinated enough*.

The Knicks’ depth is their secre

1nw9aph,https://i.redd.it/rki7ayvgbqsf1.jpeg,Atlantis Caesars Rewards Comped stay- SEP/OCT 2025,"Overview: 

Giving my full comprehensive review of the experience with all the answers to the questions I had about the resort, casino play requirement and travel experience. This was kind of the off season so the resort was dead. Lots of renovations, some water park slides closed, some restaurants and shops closed or opened limited hours. No matter where we were at on property the staff was polite and helpful. Upon check in the desk agent gave us an upgrade to an ocean view room on a high floor free of charge. Overall the resort is a bit dated and the rooms at the Royal (renovated in 2022) need some work.

Deal: 4 nights for free in the coral, only have to pay gratuity and resort fee. Due to renovations at the coral we were placed in the Royal, which is an upgrade. We were required to play 4hrs of rated play in the casino (more on that below)

Casino Play: 

Table games and slots count toward your rated play. For table games it’s literally the time you are at the table after handing over your player card. For slots it’s also based off the time you are sitting there and actively playing. They have slots as cheap as 0.27 per pull. 

- What’s considered active play on the slots? Well I was able to wait upwards is 60-90sec between pulls and the timer never stopped.

- How do I know how much time I’ve played?
Ask the casino desk and they will tell you. Their system updated within a few min of me leaving the slots to check my time.

- Are drinks free in the casino?
Yes, as long as you’re playing but service is infrequent and slow also you’re expected to tip the waitress. 

Overall the minimums for most of the table games was $15-$25. I imagine when it’s not the off season those can go up higher. The casino does not offer Pai Gow as a table game. Overall very limited amount of table games. 

Travel advice:

- Book the transportation from majestic tours through the Atlantis website. It was super easy to pre purchase and once we made It through immigration/customs we found the Atlantis desk and they directed us outside to majestic tours. It’s about a 25-30min ride from the airport. On return they will expect you to leave the hotel 3hrs before your departure time

- Clearing immigration and customs was very easy. Make sure you have immigration form filled out for everyone in your party, even babies. They did not even check our bags at customs. Pack as much dry goods snacks and drinks as you can/want. I had no issue getting my dry goods, baby food, formula and drinks through with my checked bags. Don’t bring fresh fruits/vegetables or fresh dairy/meat products. Sealed canned/frozen meat is fine.  

- The rooms at the Royal have small fridges that can fit a decent amount. Every floor has an ice machine and filtered water station for use. The rooms do not have microwaves or toasters. There is a small coffee machine.  

Any questions? I probably have the answer, ask away!

We met on a dating app and our first date was at this coffee shop near my place and it just felt right you know? Good conversation, no awkward silences, she seemed into it.

Here's where im probably messing up.. every date since then has been at the same spot. Same coffee shop, same corner table. I get my americano she gets her latte and we just talk for hours. In my head im thinking this is OUR spot now and its nice having that consistency, like we have this little routine going.

But last night when I texted ""usual spot?"" she replied ""sure"" but something felt off about it. No emoji, just sure. Now im wondering if she thinks im boring or uncreative? She mentioned a ramen place a while back and I agreed it sounded good but then just defaulted back to suggesting coffee cause its easy and I know we both like it there.

1nw98oi,https://i.redd.it/mfk572v3bqsf1.jpeg,The First Ripple — Origins of the Absurd Self,"
Good morning, you magnificent glitch. Ever snap awake mid-dream, heart racing, like you just got yanked out of someone else’s body? Or sit there, staring at your coffee swirl, and suddenly think: “Thirteen point eight billion years ago, a bang happened, and now it’s fueling my existential spiral in a chipped mug.” That’s where I’m at. Origins of the self, but not in the textbook way — more in the “what the hell am I even doing here” way.

Cosmic beginnings first, because nothing humbles like realizing we’re late to the party. The Big Bang wasn’t fireworks — it was chaos. Quantum hiccups turning into matter, particles showing up and ghosting like flaky friends. Inflation, galaxies, stars coughing themselves to death and leaving metals behind. Sagan said we’re star stuff, but it hits different when you realize every heavy atom in your body used to be inside a star that exploded. I once lay on a beach, post-breakup, staring at the Milky Way, and thought: “Billions of years, and I’m crying over texts?” The waves didn’t argue.

Then biology, the messy bootstraps. Evolution isn’t progress — it’s survival by accident. LUCA, some lonely cell in primordial soup, started it all. Mutations, disasters, fish with bad ideas crawling onto land, apes fumbling into us. Brains got big, but not for truth — for survival. Quick instincts, false patterns. That’s why we find faces in clouds and gods in thunderstorms. Personal note: when I was ten, I crowned myself king of a cardboard fort. Turns out adulthood is just shinier forts — jobs, relationships, all temporary walls against the void. One therapist told me: “Your self is just a story you keep editing.” Damn. Felt like getting called out by my own brain.

Philosophy? Makes it worse. Descartes says thinking proves we exist. Hume says we’re just a messy bundle of sensations. Buddhism goes further: no self at all, just ripples pretending to be waves. Sometimes I sit in meditation and feel like I’m dissolving, until my leg cramps and I curse myself back into existence. And if reality collapses when it’s observed, like quantum physics hints, maybe we’re Schrödinger’s identities — half-formed until someone “likes” our post. Which is depressing. Or hilarious. Maybe both.

Camus had a point: life’s absurd, like pushing boulders uphill for no reason. But instead of despair, he said laugh, rebel, make something. Honestly, my happiest moments weren’t in chasing purpose but in stupid side quests — arguing Nietzsche over cheap wine, getting lost on road trips, cooking pasta badly and laughing until it burned.

And here’s the thing: origins don’t lock us in. Genes bend, trauma rewrites, but so does resilience. Every ripple we throw out into the pond changes the shape of the next.

So yeah, the first ripple is you. Ancient, absurd, alive. Go make waves, even dumb little ones. The pond’s waiting.

We were sitting in the kitchen. The clock ticked too loudly, and the coffee in my mug had gone cold hours ago. I hadn't taken a sip. Neither had she.

""Can we talk?"" I asked, though I already knew the answer would change everything.

She looked up from her phone slowly, deliberately. There was something behind her eyes not guilt, not quite, but a readiness. Like she knew what was coming.

""About what?"" she said.

I swallowed hard, felt the weight in my chest press down. ""About him.""

Her fingers froze. Just for a second. Just long enough.

""What are you talking about?"" she said, voice soft, rehearsed.

""You know exactly what I'm talking about."" I tried to keep my voice steady, not let it crack. ""I saw the texts. I didn’t go looking for them they just popped up. You left your phone in the car.""

Silence.

She looked down, then back up. Her eyes welled, but not with the tears I expected. Not regret. Not sorrow. Just exhaustion.

""I didn’t want it to happen,"" she said finally. ""But it did.""

There it was. No excuses. No lies. Just the truth, bare and blunt.

I didn’t yell. I didn’t throw anything. I think part of me already knew. The late nights. The distance. The way she smiled less and less when I walked into a room.

""Why?"" I asked. It was all I could say.

She looked away, out the window, as if the answer might be written in the sky. ""Because I was lonely. And I didn't know how to talk to you anymore. And... I didn’t think you saw me.""

That hit harder than I expected.

""I’ve always seen you,"" I said, barely above a whisper. ""Maybe I just forgot how to show it.""

We sat in that kitchen for what felt like hours. The world didn’t end. The house didn’t fall apart. But something between us cracked, quietly like a plate set down too hard on a counter.

She reached for my hand. I let her. Not because I forgave her not yet but because despite everything, some part of me still hoped we could find our way back.

Not to how it was.

But maybe, someday, to something honest.",4,1759424065.0,story,1,1.0,False

I’m 5'8, wear glasses, brown skin, dark hair and eyes. I work as a software developer. I don’t smoke or drink. I’m Christian, and my faith matters to me, but I’m open to anyone who respects that.

I’m a bit introverted at first, but once I’m comfortable I talk a lot, stay loyal, and keep things consistent. I don’t like drama - I prefer slow and steady connections where we can take time to know each other.

Most evenings are simple: coffee, soft music, and a good show. I enjoy small chats about how the day went, sharing songs, laughing at funny scenes, and making little plans we actually do.

I like anime and K-dramas (Naruto and Demon Slayer are favorites), Turkish shows, and story-driven movies. I listen to all kinds of music and love finding new tracks for late-night playlists. I cook simple meals, enjoy hiking, quiet walks, stargazing, and I’d pick a museum or café over a party any day. I used to game a lot, now it’s just Genshin once in a while. I love travel (Japan and Switzerland are dream spots), but I also enjoy calm weekends at home.

I’m looking for someone kind, steady, and emotionally open. Long distance is fine if both try equally. If it feels right, I’m open to closing the gap.

If this feels like your vibe, just say hi with your age and location - we can talk and see where it goes .Thanks for reading. Take care!

I (28M) recently started a new job at a fairly chill marketing firm. It's hybrid, but on in-office days, everyone's big on coffee runs. Being the new guy, I wanted to make a good impression, especially on my boss, who is a total coffee snob.

Cue me offering to do the coffee run one morning. My boss says, “I usually get a pour-over Ethiopian roast, black.” Fancy. The rest of the team gives me their orders, all relatively normal, and I head to this local hipster coffee shop nearby.

Here’s where I messed up: I had *no idea* what a pour-over actually was.

I confidently ordered what I *thought* was close enough: a “drip coffee, dark roast.” The barista side-eyed me but didn’t say anything. I returned, handed everyone their drinks, and got back to work feeling like a caffeinated hero.

About 15 minutes later, my boss walks over, holding his cup like it personally offended him.

Boss: “Hey... did they change their roast today? This tastes... like asphalt.”

I panicked and just said, “Yeah, I think they were out of the usual?”

He nods slowly and goes, “Hmm. Alright.” Then he walks off.

Later, I Googled what a pour-over actually is.

It’s not even remotely the same as a drip coffee.

I ended up confessing to him the next day, and he laughed way harder than I expected. Apparently, he figured it out pretty quickly but appreciated the effort. Now whenever he gets coffee, he jokes, “Anyone want the ‘asphalt blend’?”

TL;DR: Tried to impress my boss by getting him a fancy coffee, gave him truck stop mud instead, and now I’m immortalized as “asphalt guy.”",1,1759423878.0,story,1,1.0,False
1nw9592,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nw9592,Summer Alaska - a ten day iternary.,"
This is how my trip to Alaska went, and I thought it might help anyone planning a summer visit. I’m sharing our route, experiences, and packing tips—because while Google has plenty of info, nothing beats hearing it from someone who’s actually been there.

Cities we visited:
	•	Anchorage
	•	Seward
	•	Valdez
	•	Talkeetna
	•	Palmer
	•	Wasilla

Places we skipped this time:
	•	Denali
	•	Chitina / McCarthy
	•	Fairbanks
	•	Katmai
What we did was loop around the mid and southern part of Alaska—starting in Anchorage, making our way through the sights, and then circling back to Anchorage to complete the trip.



Packing & weather

When I visited Alaska in the summer, I realized it’s not as cold as people think—the midnight sun makes the days feel endless. I only really needed my down jacket and rain jacket when we were out on the glaciers, where it gets chilly. The rest of the time, regular hiking pants and shirts were fine, with a couple of thermals just in case. On hikes, I found breathable layers worked best since you warm up quickly, and a small daypack with snacks and water was enough. One thing I wish I knew earlier—mosquitoes are no joke. Spray helped a little, but a mosquito net over the head was a lifesaver.


itinerary and experience:

day 1 to 3:
We landed in Anchorage and drove straight to Seward, and honestly, the drive itself is breathtaking—make sure you grab a window seat no matter what. Seward is a beautiful little town surrounded by mountains and ocean views. The highlight here was the Kenai Fjords boat tour (we picked the Northwestern route), and it was absolutely stunning. We spotted whales, puffins, sea lions, and even witnessed a pod of orcas hunting—a rare “National Geographic” moment, as our captain put it. If you go, carry binoculars, gloves, and a beanie—it gets really cold on the deck. Downtown Seward also has great breweries, coffee shops, and food spots worth checking out. We also hiked Exit Glacier and did the Harding Icefield trek. Even as someone with little hiking experience, I managed the 6-hour round trip, and it was tough but so worth it—definitely a must-do if you have a day to spare.

kayaking in the Kenai Fjords. We didn’t get to do it, but it looked incredible—paddling right up close to the cliffs, glaciers, and wildlife. From the water, you get a whole new perspective of the mountains, the seabirds nesting along the cliffs, and the wild vegetation growing straight out of the rock. It’s hard to put into words, but if you’re comfortable on the water, this would be an unforgettable experience.

day 4 &5:
Next up was Valdez, and we chose to drive there—and wow, the road trip itself was absolutely stunning. If you have the time, I’d highly recommend going by road at least one way. There’s also the option of taking a ferry that carries your car, which makes the return a lot easier and less tiring. My advice: drive one way for the views, and take the ferry back to save some energy.

In Valdez, we visited a salmon hatchery, and it was amazing to watch sea lions catching salmon while the fish fought their way upstream to spawn. We also explored a couple of hikes around town. Valdez itself is a small, charming place surrounded by massive mountains—it feels tucked away yet incredibly scenic. Compared to Seward, it’s quieter and less crowded, but honestly just as beautiful. The 7-hour drive to get there is absolutely worth it.

In Valdez, we tried the John Hunter Memorial Trailhead (also called the Solomon Trail)—a short hike with rewarding views. We also stopped by Valdez Glacier Lake, the Worthington Glacier lookout, and drove through Thompson Pass. On the way, we saw Horsetail Falls, Bridal Veil Falls, and the stunning Keystone Canyon. The waterfalls and canyon are an absolute must-see and really add to the whole Valdez experience.


day 6 to 10 :
We spent a day in Talkeetna, and it was one of the most memorable stops. The highlight was a K2 Aviation flight over the Denali range, complete with a surreal glacier landing—standing on ice surrounded by towering peaks made me feel tiny in the best way. The town itself is super charming, packed with eateries, breweries, and quirky shops. We also rented electric bikes to explore a trail, and along the way, we ran into a moose and her calf just chilling on the path. Keeping a safe distance, we watched in awe—the sheer size of a moose up close is mind-blowing. Between the flight, the food, and that unexpected wildlife encounter, Talkeetna was pure magic.

Near Palmer, we explored Hatcher Pass, and it’s definitely a must-see. The valley is gorgeous, surrounded by mountains with plenty of hiking options. Some of the popular trails here are the Gold Mint Trail and the Reed Lake Trail, both full-day hikes that take about 6–8 hours depending on your pace—but the views are absolutely worth it. There’s also the Independence Mine State Historic Park, which adds a unique touch of history to the area. If you’re planning a trip, I’d say set aside at least one full day just for Hatcher Pass.

We also did the Matanuska Glacier Ice Walking and Ice Climbing tour, which is offered by both MICA and NOVA companies. The ice climbing itself is pretty intense—I wouldn’t recommend it if you don’t have solid upper and lower body strength. I gave it a try but couldn’t push myself up as much as I hoped, so it wasn’t as satisfying. The ice walking, on the other hand, was fantastic and much more doable. It’s definitely not a cheap activity, so if climbing feels too vigorous, there are plenty of other ways to experience the glacier that are just as enjoyable.

We spent a day exploring Wasilla and Palmer before heading back to Anchorage. There, we checked out a few lookout points and visited the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center, which is a great spot to see animals—including bears—since we didn’t get lucky spotting one in the wild. We also stopped at Beluga Point, did some shopping, and treated ourselves to good food and desserts. A highlight was trying the much-talked-about Wild Scoops, where we sampled a platter of ice creams. Of course, we wrapped it up with some classic souvenir shopping before calling it a trip.

Let me know if you want to hear more about food, sports or the places, why we opted out and maybe other recreational activities that we wanted to do, but didn't. 

hope somebody finds this informational.

Honestly have just started with Chase forever, and had my high school account first which then got upgraded all while using the freedom unlimited card, now I'm going to med school in about a year and just looking to actually see if there's better cards or setups out there beside using this one card for everything. I've been disappointed mainly with the usability of the card and it's app compared to something like an apple card which just has so many nice features for spending tracking etc as well.",1,1759423814.0,CreditCards,5,0.67,False

-Just because Heart has a photo with Anna Wintour or other important fashion figures doesn’t mean she’s a heavy hitter - she’s not. Didn’t she have to pay for her Vogue 100 membership just to be included in their Fashion Week events before?

-She buys her way into shows (2nd biggest global client nga daw ng YSL according to her glam team member diba?), and she’s lucky if SSI asks her to represent them at some shows.

-Who does she influence? A bunch of social climbers, nepo wives and kabits. When you ask legit fashion critics globally, pretty sure hindi nila kilala yang si Heart 😂

-She poses for street style photographers hoping that they will get her photos published everywhere. Ever wondered why she bribes them with coffee and cookies? Galawang DESPERATE ATTENTION SEEKER. 😂

I tried to do some research on this thread but couldn't quite find the answer to this.

I have a new espresso machine and am recognizing the importance of getting water right *before* it goes in the machine (my old was a barista express and I just descaled, but I'm realizing now that isn't great for coffee and especially not for dual boilers, which aren't recommended to descale).

Per the recommendation of WholeLatteLove, I got a BWT pitcher and filter. I tried the test strips, but goodness are they hard to read.

SO, I just got the API kH and gH test kit.

For regular water, I got 53.7 ppm for kH (carbonate) and 143ppm for gH (general hardness)

For BTW Magnesium filtered, I got essentially 0 (maybe 17ppm) for kH (never really turned blue), and 107 for gH.

So, I can see that I'm probably *already* good for carbonate but the filter is definitely reducing it, but even after filtered, my general hardness is still high.

Does general hardness also contribute to scaling, or is a low kH sufficient to avoid scaling issues in the machine? Should I try a different pitcher/filter system for better general softening?

Coffee tastes good to us, so I'm primarily just trying other think about taking care of my machine longterm!

1nw90lt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1nw90lt/my_wild_ride_six_year_divorce_battle_from_surgeon/,My wild ride: Six year Divorce battle from surgeon and I got the kids & nothing else,"This is a brief description of what’s unfolded in my life in the last six years since I filed for divorce against a pretty famous plastic surgeon. I was married in 2012, moved to a beautiful home in Bel Air, California.  Over the next few years my husband and I welcomed three beautiful children while also raising my two children from the previous marriage, and I was a stepmother to his three children from three previous marriages. Before I start my story. I know- I know,I signed up to be a fourth wife and perhaps I should’ve expected that if I ever left the marriage, it wouldn’t end well so let’s skip the marriage and get to the good parts. The divorce that left me penniless, on welfare and barely able to feed my three children while my ex-husband drives a Rolls-Royce and the gag is the court bought everything he said, hook line and sinker.  
I started my divorce as any other woman, I was in an unhappy marriage with a cheating spouse who controlled the purse strings, and he was a massive wage earner. In fact, I worked for him for several years in our family business, all while taking  care of our children, our home, And managing our personal lives. When I made the decision to leave, I was completely blindsided by my first few court hearings. In my mind, I would go to court- provide brief documentation, simply state I needed a divorce and move on with my life, despite the terrible circumstances. In actuality, the first thing I got was a move out order– my soon to be ex-husband didn’t want the kids, but he wanted the house and wanted me to get out of it. So very quickly I found myself leaving Bel Air and living in a small rental with all of the children. I realized that the person I was divorcing was nothing like the new person I thought I married. The man that was in threat of losing money in a California divorce. I struggled for years to try to get support despite court orders, and we’re not talking about what most people perceive as regular. I had orders of upwards of $50,000 a month and their many years  zero was paid. Clearly there was a disparity in income. I no longer had a job because I worked for my husband, and the first thing he did was fire me when I filed divorce, so  Attorney fees and cost were awarded in the duration of our legal proceedings. 

Then strangely no one did anything as the years slipped by and he paid nothing and  the litigation, just continued and continued. Our small children got older, and I went from thinking the court would help me to knowing the court was apathetic. Now let me be clear, this is not a post where I’m saying family court is bad. It’s worse than bad. The very entity I turned to for help more so for my children than myself became the eye, rolling, irritated entity, that dismantled my rights, disenfranchise my children, and looked the other way as my estranged has been, I mean husband traveled The world-spent through millions of dollars and then slowly via divorce planning dismantled all of our community estate so that there was nothing to share.

I lost my first attorney three years into my case he walked away because despite law and precedent and family codes, he had no way to force his orders, and the courts told him there was nothing they could do. I was fortunate enough to get another attorney despite having literally no money. I sold all my designer clothes, handbags, nice jewelry literally to survive during this time and to come up with the money to just continue to go to pointless, endless hearings. All of the hearings were about my ex complying with previous orders and excuse after excuse, turned into years of hearing and literally nothing was ever done. 

What transpired over the last three years of my divorce was a solo practitioner, destroying his practice in order to provide me support in my legal proceedings. Over $500,000 in orders were made and zero was paid to that order. Court sanctions went unpaid. And I watched quietly and quite shocked. The court didn’t wring its hands and wonder what they could do the court -it didn’t care, and in fact acted to solely protect the plastic surgeon. 

Fast-forward to 2023,when the home was ordered to be sold in order to place money in an attorney trust for attorney fees, over $1 million in child support and spousal support due. The relief I felt was powerful. But then my ex wouldn’t let anyone in the house to take photographs. He would not let the realtor show the home then he started threatening the Realtor via email, and she even contacted me privately and asked if I thought he would physically harm her… Instead of the court, putting its foot down finally, they told him to refinance the house and keep it and pay some money towards past due Child Support my ex responded by letting the Home go into foreclosure or at least that’s what he says you can look the Home up now on Zillow. It’s the only house I know of in Bel Air California, that’s absolutely gorgeous and been on the market for almost 2 years. And then something almost even more peculiar happened, a plastic surgeon who had been in the same location with millions of dollars improvements to his office spaces and surgical rooms failed to pay his rent for years and let himself be evicted. This all comes after a very viral moment that involved a woman having glue in her hair, other prestigious, doctors renting his office space and records showing they paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to rent his surgery spaces or do consultations in his office spaces while they establish their own private practices. And after three sets of discovery and almost no information turned over and doing a little research on his attorney who famously represented someone in Hollywood who tried to ruin a pirate of the Caribbean‘s career (allegedly ), I realized that no one was ethical from the courts, to the attorneys to my ex and all I had was a solo practitioner Attorney and my kids. I think it’s pertinent to state that I also had at least seven different judges over the course of litigation. At some points, the judges  turned over more than kids at the register at your local McDonald’s.  

I had a hard conversation with my attorney one day and he said look get on public assistance. You can’t afford food-you’re working two jobs and you’re going underwater so that’s what I did. I started receiving SNAP benefits and medical benefits for my children so they could go to the doctor because their dad didn’t even provide medical insurance for them. As a position his claim to me into the courts was we didn’t need medical insurance because as a doctor he provided to the children himself. I don’t think we need to discuss that a plastic surgeon that does nose jobs isn’t a pediatrician, nor is it a good environment for two people having a contentious divorce to seek medical care from his staff. Did the court get angry or make new orders? No, I was admonished by the court for stealing from the public when I had resources, even though they were well aware of my situation and all of their catastrophic failures to enforce court orders for years on end.

Well, in spring of 2025, I went to trial at great protest with no attorney, no fees paid, no discovery, no way to have experts testify and completely alone. The LA Superior judge in depart 18 stated simply, you have no right to consel. I completed a two week trial alone against a surgeon and his legal team. 

I had informed the court, on multiple occasions that I had lost my vehicle. That myself and my children were on public assistance to even get by. So despite having great difficulties even getting to court daily, I represented myself sometimes not even having $.50 for printing cost or money for a cup of coffee. 

As I was handed massive printed binders of exhibits for my ex to put on his case by his attorney’s assistant, I sat there with small folders I had recycled from my kids homework. Things that I had kept over the years, unable to make copies for the court order to provide to respondent’s council. Some days my belly even growled because I couldn’t afford lunch during our breaks. After the first few days I realized I had to pack lunches and bring them with me in order to stay focused and the do the best I could under the circumstances. I didn’t sleep for two weeks. After full days of court, I rushed home to care for my children, clean our  small apartment wash clothes and still get them to their practices – practices that hadn’t been paid for and great pressure for them to leave the team… and after I put them to bed, I often met the sun first thing in the morning, sitting asking ChatGPT every question I could think of that would somehow help me put on a case that was remotely fair. While budgeting my food stamp budget telling myself don’t buy an apple for your 10 minute morning break because it’ll take away from the kids, I often simply just went to a bathroom stall and sat and pulled myself back together before going back into the courtroom to continue to put on a case with the judge seemed to be prosecuting with and for my ex-husband who was there with staff and attorney as I alone. 

Every witness that has to be called was rejected. The judge said I could testify to my own experiences and they were not unnecessary. All of the exhibits I had painstakingly prepared were objected to and as a person I suppose I didn’t properly lay foundation and at one point, the judge attempted to tell me how to better attempt to lay foundation to bring in exhibits Which law school can’t be done in five minutes, no matter how much you reach ChatGPT. My clear and direct, receipts for hundreds of thousands of dollars thrown away. there were some months he paid zero dollars in child support but spent tens of thousands of dollars eating out traveling or just writing checks to cash that no one cared to trace. I also have my ex-husband on Direct which equals Questioning him for hours on end and he outright said yes everything is mine. There’s nothing left -spoke horrifically about me and when it was my turn, there was no one to ask me questionsI simply got a rushed narrative while everyone would looked at a clock and asked  “are you almost done” and after two weeks, it was more than clear that I was screwed. 95% of my exhibits were excluded by objections of a 30 year experience Attorney. 90% of my ex-husband‘s exhibits were included because he had an attorney to lay foundation and bring them in properly. My husband had multiple experts I had none I previously had a forensic accountant. They’re fully complete financial analysis was disallowed because she wasn’t able to come to court as I didn’t have the money to pay her money that had been previously ordered and had gone unpaid, and the judge said essentially I had years to litigate save money and get it done myself. My children psychologist, my psychologist, my landlord, my friends, and my family were all precluded from any testimony as to what they witnessed as she said I could testify myself when I would go to “testify“, she would abruptly asked me questions in the middle of my statements, she meeting the judge and then rush me through my answers and or tell me it was time for a break lunch or the end of the day  

After two weeks, my trial concluded it took the judge over six months to prepare and sign the final order. She erased all previous Child Support due and gave my ex-husband a credit of tens of thousands of dollars which she deducted for my spousal support that was due. I know the story can’t show how complex this case is but essentially because he had paid no spouse support since 2020. She would reduce the amount of spouse support from over $15,000 to 2500. Took the new amount due Added the credit he got from Child Support and gave him a nominal balance. She found that all assets were gone, therefore were not to be divided, there were no breaches and fiduciary duty even though he had refinance the house on multiple occasions transferred hundreds of thousands of dollars, spent millions of dollars and done many things that are probably criminal. I attempted to prove in court  all of this, and my divorce settlement after almost a decade of marriage to a Harvard plastic surgeon was $0.00 with him getting a child credit and she deferred him to start paying until October 1 which was yesterday. Yesterday when I called Child Support enforcement to ask if he had started his first Payment I was informed that because I have been on public assistance I will not receive any child support until I pay back all of the money in snap benefits my children essentially rewarded alone on food stamps after me fighting for our lives and running up an $800,000 bill with multiple attorneys in a court looking the other way and cuddling a man who sat in court wearing diamond Cartier watches. Oh, couldn’t be bothered to show up because he was in Paris, Istanbul or somewhere in Africa I’m grateful I’m finally divorced as of about a week ago, but never in my wildest dreams when I thought leaving a person that wasn’t a good husband or a good father Would lead to me not knowing how to provide housing or food for my children and that the courts would not only sanction it, but diminish me to graveling for any amount of help and when the help arrived it’s like someone handing you a cup full of rice when you’re starving And then telling you you owe it all back to them so now I start my task of paying back the state for the social services that kept my children fed my family court judges look the other way and didn’t make their father helped me support them in my estimation in 6 to 9 months. I’ll pay back the support if he continues to pay, and if he doesn’t, I’m pretty sure my kids will just reach age of majority and nothing will ever be done. 

He got to spend waste and hide a decade of our lives and tens of millions of dollars. But I got legal custody of my children days after the trial concluded he disappeared for two months so I’m settling into my new normal. I fought for my life and I got my children and he got everything else and I think the saddest part is that the court was the highway that allowed him to do this and they knew he was doing it, but it’s easier to disenfranchise a mother than it is a powerful politically connected, wealthy surgeon who is corrupt and doesn’t want to follow the rules. 

Ah well.

I occasionally get tonsil stones so I have really worked on my oral hygiene to get these to go away! But I’ve noticed now deep on the back of my tongue, I get this like clusters of white dots. It looks just like tonsil stones. My breath and mouth feels the same as tonsil stones that it’s just dirty back there. I floss, water floss (and try to angle to the back of my tongue but doesn’t work well), brush with oral b electric tooth brush, tongue scrape then finish with therabreath mouthwash . I do this atleast 2x per day. 
My tongue scraper cannot reach this part of my tongue because it’s so far back/my tongue has a small u shape curve in the back that even angled, my spoon shaped scraper can’t reach. The only way I get them off is my holding my tooth brush over the spot. I noticed it pop up mostly after having something like hot tea with honey or after my coffee with creamer. I don’t think it’s the yeast stuff because it goes away and doesn’t come back until after eating! 
Has anyone had this or know what it might be? What can I do to get rid of it? 
I think maybe it has to do with post nasal drip. I sometimes feel like I have mucus in my throat after eating and feel the need to clear my throat. 
Oh I also drink about 80-120 oz of water per day. 
And for reference, I have to stick the tooth brush so far back I’m gagging whilst doing it. I just feel like there has to be something else I could do. ",3,1759423537.0,hygiene,5,1.0,False

So while all the “bad things” happening, I keep getting success too like I will think tmr somebody is asking me out and I’m not going out. BOOM, next day someone that I never talk before but we followed each other on insta(but honestly I have no idea who he is) replied my story and asked am I up for a drink.

I try again with this week someone is buying me coffee. BOOM, my colleague suddenly offer to buy my whole team coffee on Wed. But I wasn’t in office on Wed so I was thinking Ngaw I demand this but I miss it but nope I’m still getting that coffee. BOOM, Thurs my colleague told me he bought the cold brew bottle and kept in the fridge for me since I’m not in on Wed.

 What inspire me to write this is because I realized that “ghost old me dream” is like a sign or hint for me that old me is not going to disappear that easily and she is trying everything she can to pull me back down again but NOPE girl is on next level now and I know I am always chosen in love in life in everything and everything ALWAYS works in my favour

1nw8xp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1nw8xp7/night_shift/,Night shift,"This is for all of my fellow night shifters (or folks who work other odd hours). It’s come to my attention that my work schedule-three 12 hour night shifts a week, usually consecutively-causes my weight to increase by 3-5lbs by the end of the 3rd night. I’m definitely bloated. I don’t eat differently on work nights, and usually choose to eat rather on the light side so that I’m not sluggish. I easily get 10k+ steps and keep my drinks to water only (except one cup of coffee around midnight) so I’m getting over 100oz during that time. 

It’s not really something I’m overly worried about in the long run because it always comes off after about 24 hours of catching up on sleep, but it’s interesting that it keeps happening so consistently. Does this happen to anyone else? And if it does, have you figured out how to tame it?

Rivana- short, catchy, has my nick name (Ri) BUT sounds to much like nirvana for my liking.

Rikat- I've gone by this for a long time, I have a cat obsession, but this sounds to childish I feel.

Rivox- again short and catchy but I feel like it's bland/basic for a creator name 

Rilix- same as Rivox also sounds a lot like skrilliex

BassPaw- love this but doesn't feel catchy enough, also sounds like a warrior cat name

InkPurr- love love but seems childish

AshenPurr- cool but seems immature and again like a warrior cat name

Hello o/

It's Chay once again, this is Day 5 of my experiences in this thing called life, and before someone says this ain't connected to YH, let me remind you that I relate my experiences how I would see someone from that universe will tell themselves :)

What did I get up to? Well basically growing up and enjoying life. I just did Karaoke today as I'm writing this. It honestly healed something in me, and made me enjoy the time spent with friends and sing about heartbreak, which was fun in itself. 

I went out with my family, went to this mall, saw a sign that made me a lil happy, about making everyday living brighter, and I'm sure Alex felt the same way with Elias, but he's just lucky someone tolerated his BS XD

The mall hopping went crazy and we went home late, tired, but really enjoyable. Went to uni the next day, there was events happening, some volleyball game, and I got some ""ramen"" but it's like the ramyeon thing where you make it your own. It was good with a side of kimchi. Got some donuts and coffee to end the day with some classmates, and it really dawned on me how these everyday decisions really does make life worth living, even in the small things.

Saw a huge sign for Cinemalaya, a local Philippine Film Festival which I'm keen to see if I will check any out. Had drinks with those friends I told you about before heading out for Karaoke, and saw Gachapons and Ice Skating, which both terrified me and excited me. 

The last photo is dear to me. I shared this to chat yesterday, basically finding a photo that is the most fruity I guess. With me is my lil brother irl, and he is so much different than he is now. Really makes you think about growing up huh. Did Elias and Alexander in the future thought of that? I imagine them having such a good time together, the good, and the bad, but nonetheless always stood together no matter what.

If I could wish for one thing, I would go back in time, hug my younger self, tell him how proud and how brave of a kid he is, and tell him that Chay now is doing his best, that he is still a kid at heart, just with heavier shoulders. That no matter what happens, the choices we make, and the emotions altogether will truly be as beautiful as Elias' drawings, it may seem basic now, but in time, you'll know. 

Another day is done, on to the next.

I went all in and tested all 17 Transparent Labs whey isolate flavors, including the six new drops.

Some are worth drinking every day. A few are fun but niche. Two are straight up skips.

Here’s the breakdown.

**Flavors I would skip**

* Chocolate chip banana bread, sounds great but bitter and fades fast
* Blueberry pancakes, syrupy and niche, fun idea but not an everyday shake

**Decent but situational**

* Mint chocolate chip, refreshing but not daily
* Butterscotch pecan, good dessert vibe, not for mornings
* Chocolate coconut, you either love coconut or you don’t
* Strawberry milkshake, a little artificial

**Solid daily drivers**

* Milk chocolate, safe and smooth
* French vanilla, versatile in smoothies or coffee
* Vanilla peanut butter, richer twist on vanilla
* Dark chocolate, rich cocoa, awesome even in water
* Mocha, legit morning coffee replacement
* S’mores, marshmallow chocolate vibe without being too sweet

**The new champion**

* Salted chocolate caramel, perfectly balanced, sweet meets salty, works every day in water or milk

**Takeaway**

If you only want the safe picks: milk chocolate, dark chocolate, mocha, salted chocolate caramel.

If you want something fun: s’mores or vanilla peanut butter.

Skip the banana bread and blueberry.

**NEWS AND ISSUES**

* On Monday, some users (including me) were getting a ""an error occurred (status: 500)"" error when commenting on old Reddit. The comment would be posted, but that would pop up. Flagged this to the team in charge of that feature and they got that fixed up.

* Also on Monday, some users were reporting difficulty logging into their accounts in Firefox. Flagged this to the team in charge and they looked at some logs to try to figure out what was going on and got that worked out. 

* You may have heard that due to the [UK Online Safety Act](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditSafety/comments/1lzt65t/verifying_the_age_but_not_the_identity_of_uk/), that [access to Imgur from the UK is no longer available](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11FMckykqZSwI46EO2n-8xp9urtIOgSf5FJGbULExOXw/edit?usp=sharing). If you are connecting to Reddit in the UK or are connecting to Reddit in a way that goes through the UK, and you are trying to access an image on Reddit that is hosted on Imgur, it will not be available even if you have verified your age on Reddit. 

* There is an experiment where notifications are grouped together. Feel free to leave constructive feedback in this post and I'll share it with that team. 

* Speaking of experiments, please refer to [this Help Center article](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/40516921738132-Why-am-I-experiencing-changes-to-the-app-or-desktop-site) for more information about experiments on the site.

**PLEASE REPORT RULE BREAKING CONTENT**

* If you see content in r/help that breaks the rules of r/help, **please use the report button.** You do not need to engage with those users unless you're going to redirect them to where they can actually get the help that they're looking for. But regardless, **please report rule breaking content**. Reporting content that breaks the rules helps us keep r/help free of spam and off-topic posts, and that allows users who really need out help to more easily get it. The mods can't see everything all the time, so reporting content is a great way to surface it to the mods so that they can deal with it.  No one likes a spammer! Don't get 'em get away with it!

**COMMON ACCOUNT ISSUES**

* If no one else can see your posts or comments across Reddit (not just in one sub) and you are unable to post here in r/help, you can file an appeal [here](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000600232).

* If your account gets the ""server error"" banner or you can't update your profile, I can fix that sometimes! Please note that I cannot give any information or assist with any account unless contacted directly from that account. **I cannot fix accounts where you are receiving the ""server error"" message and are unable to view content from that account when logged out.** In those instances, you will need to file an appeal. But if it's not an appeal situation, let me know and I'll take a look and get you all taken care of! (I haven't seen many of these lately, so this issue might have dwindled down to where I don't need this here, but I'll leave it up for a little while because whenever something like that gets said, it comes roaring back.) 

* Please check the [Help Center](https://www.reddithelp.com/) to see if you can find the answer to your question there. Also, check this sub for stickied posts regarding outages, major issues and downtime.

**BUGS ROUND UP (COURTESY OF CORRECTSCALE)**

* [Android] [GIFs in comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/bugs/comments/1ns0s1g/android_gifs_wont_load_on_mobile_2025380/) were not working for a little while on Monday. This was due to an experiment that was stopped yesterday and that fixed it. If you're still experiencing this issue, please force stop and restart the app. 

* [iOS] More GIF issues! [GIFs in comments menu](https://www.reddit.com/r/bugs/comments/1nuezon/ios_16_as_of_30_september_2025_you_cant_post_gifs/nh0nbp2/) is not showing any GIFs in communities that have that feature enabled. The fix is in the works, but there is not an estimate as to when it will be completed.

* [Both apps] Some mods are experiencing this [comment loading bug](https://www.reddit.com/r/bugs/comments/1nsdq3x/android_mod_error_message_every_time_i_try_to/). Seems to be hitting some mods in specific subreddits. This is being investigated. Shout out to u/westcoastcdn19 for pointing this out!

* [Web] [Gallery posts haven't been populating](https://www.reddit.com/r/bugs/comments/1nvabbu/images_disappear_after_loading_on_some_reddit/) all images in a post. That fix went out yesterday and we should be good now.

* 3,500 comments which is down 1,100 from the 4,600 comments last week.

**HELP THAT HELPS HELP R/HELP**

One of the great things about Reddit is being able to customize a lot of things just the way you want them. Let's walk through some of the settings that are available. 

You can access your settings on the desktop site [here](https://www.reddit.com/settings/). On the app, tap your profile avatar in the upper right and then tap Settings at the bottom.

The landing page for settings is where you'll find the basics like your email, password, and account authorization if you want to connect your account to your Google or Apple account. You can also enable 2fa (highly recommended), get Premium, and delete your account from that page. 

Clicking on the Profile tab [here](https://www.reddit.com/settings/profile) takes you to where you can change your display name (not your username), add a description, an avatar, a banner, and any social links. You can also change the nsfw/sfw status of your account, and both curate and moderate your profile. 

Moving over to the Privacy tab [here](https://www.reddit.com/settings/privacy), you can control things like your followers, your chats, and blocked accounts. You can also choose if your profile shows up in search results (limited), opt in to ad personalization and authorize third-party apps. 

Continuing to the Preferences tab [here](https://www.reddit.com/settings/preferences), this is where you can set the language you prefer, whether or not you want to see nsfw content, and your muted communities. You can also customize what Reddit looks like for you to some degree, including using old Reddit as your default. This is also where you can limit ads from sensitive advertising categories if there are things you just don't want to see. 

Then there's the Notifications tab [here](https://www.reddit.com/settings/notifications), which allows you to adjust how you want to be notified for certain activities, if at all!  Not all notifications can be turned completely off. 

And finally, we've come to the email tab [here](https://www.reddit.com/settings/emails) where you can decide what work of emails you want to receive from Reddit. And good news! You can completely unsubscribe from all Reddit emails.

1nw8sb7,https://i.redd.it/fo1fxnrz7qsf1.jpeg,Richmond’s Hipster Decade 2005–2015: And the Crown We Didn’t Ask For,"Richmond once got called one of the most hipster cities in America, [**number five in the country, number twenty in the world**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_(contemporary_subculture)), apparently. Depending on your disposition, that either made you proud or made you roll your eyes so hard you risked permanent damage. The thing is, it wasn’t wrong. 

From 2005 to 2015, this city leaned into an identity it didn’t ask for but somehow wore perfectly: tattoos, thrift shops, coffee, beer, loud music in small rooms, and the kind of community-building you can’t fake. It was, in hindsight, Richmond’s hipster decade. And as much as we like to make fun of it now, they/we made this place what it is.

Hey, friends! Have you ever sat back and thought about how quickly things are changing in our world? 😲 Remember when the first iPhone dropped, and we all thought it was just a fancy phone? Fast forward a few years, and now we can’t live without our smartphones. 

Well, guess what? The next FIG THING is here—**AI**! 🎉 Whether you’re a seasoned pro or just dipping your toes in, if you don’t jump on the train now, you might just get left behind.

### Why You Shouldn't Wait:

- **Opportunities Are Everywhere**: From marketing to education to healthcare, AI is revolutionizing every industry. Imagine having the skills to ride this wave! 🌊  
- **Passive Income Potential**: Hustling for those extra bucks is old news. Think about how much more you could earn if you can automate your services or create intelligent solutions!

But here's the kicker—**you need to act fast!** 

### Quick Ways to Upskill:

1. **Online Courses**: Seriously, there’s a treasure trove of resources out there. Platforms like Coursera or Udacity have incredible options, suited for all levels. 🧠  
2. **Join Communities**: Surround yourself with people who are on the same journey. This community, AiContentAutomators, is a great start! 🎉  
3. **Hands-On Projects**: Nothing beats tackling a project. Build that AI tool you’ve dreamed about! It might just be the thing that lands you your next gig or passive income stream.

Honestly, you can find something that sparks your interest in no time. And guess what, I stumbled upon this awesome **program** that can help you kickstart your AI journey: [Imagine Education AI](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals). Seriously, check it out! 

The truth is, we can all make a better future for ourselves, but we have to stop waiting for the “right time.” The right time is NOW! 📆

So what’s stopping you from diving headfirst into the world of AI? Fear? Uncertainty? Lack of time? We’ve all been there! 🤷‍♀️ The important thing is to start where you are. You may just find that this path leads to something incredible.

Number 44 in the DMV line that’s stuck on 43, who’s an old grandpa with bad vision and worse judgement. Will they take pity and renew his license? Who knows, but there’s a bar across the street. It’s so close I can taste Friday. Let’s go there to discuss. 

I mean, Wednesday gets its own animal. If Wednesday gets a hump, Thursday is…slump. Like an accordion with performance anxiety. My arms are tired, too. I have to pretend to care for two more full days? That can’t be right. 

It’s full of accidental confidence. Just oozing optimism like cash in the 90s, egotistically flagrant then followed by crushing realization. You don’t drink coffee on Thursday morning for hope. That’s Monday’s cup. Thursday’s coffee is medicinal—intravenous survival. If you normally need more than usual by this day of the week, it’s because Thursday always runs on Standard Time. You don’t even need to look at the clock. You’re already an hour behind. 

Simplicity? Difficult on Thursday. Can’t remember words like ‘toothpaste’. It’s the day you send an email *with authority* that says “reference attached” then send it before realizing you forgot the attachment…and it’s the wrong email thread. Your brain is working, but your body is out of the office. Probably sitting on a patio drinking a beer named after an endangered squirrel because you only drink IPAs made in Portland.

Lots of meetings on Thursdays. It’s the day we all talk about how much work we have on our plates and spend exactly zero minutes actually doing it. Every status update squats on Thursdays like *this is where we live now.* The whole day is providing status updates on the work I’m *not* doing. Is there a point to any of this?

Thursday’s motto is “Just Give Up.” Tuesday politeness is long gone. Monday’s patience is now a middle finger in the middle of a stop sign. Personally, I tell people that if I come back from lunch, it’s their bonus round. 

Today is the lost sock of the week. It’s the teenager who thinks it’s smarter than it is, and freedom is closer than it appears. The middle child of the calendar—counts for something, nobody seems to know for sure what though. Naturally, I’m at my peak on Thursday. Like a raccoon playing in a dumpster fire of glitter and unnecessary meetings. 

Put me in, coach.

My ex and I broke up four months ago. We've been together since high school, which is around 4 years. We're now in college, she's a freshie, I'm a junior. We were really excited for our college life since she got into the university where I am studying right now. 

Ever since the school year started, she's been so frustrated with the college workload (she's studying applied math and she's kinda the overachiever type). I tried helping her in any way I can pero just months ago, she broke up with me. She said she wants to focus on her studies and she doesn't want to be unfair sakin cause it would mean na she won't be able to play her role as my girlfriend 

I tried negotiating with her cause I don't want to end things with her but she just won't talk to me anymore, she deactivated all her socials and everytime I'd go to her place, she won't let me in. 

Then less than a month ago, I still feel so frustrated and I thought she ain't coming back to me anymore. So I asked another girl from one of my class out (my current girlfriend). I think she's pretty and nice naman, pero after weeks of dating, I don't think I really like her, cause everytime I'm with her, I'm just imagining that she is her.

Then, just recently, my current girlfriend and I went to a coffee shop sa harap ng campus, and for some God's plan, I saw her there. And she looked so stressed and I know I sound like a total sht right now but even tho my current girlfriend is with me, I feel like I want to go to her and just take her home with me

I've been on a mission lately to find the perfect mug warmer that won't break the bank, and I thought I'd share my experience with you all. After countless cold coffees and endless research, I think I've finally cracked the code.

First off, let's be real - there's nothing worse than getting caught up in work and coming back to a cold cup of coffee or tea. I used to microwave my drinks multiple times a day until I realized there's a better way.

Here's what I learned about choosing a mug warmer:

Temperature Control Matters
The best mug warmers I've found have adjustable temperature settings. You don't want something that'll burn your drink or keep it barely lukewarm. Look for devices that maintain around 130-150°F - that's the sweet spot for most beverages.

Build Quality
Don't fall for those super cheap options. Trust me, I learned this the hard way. You want something with good heat distribution and reliable electronics. After trying several options, I found this awesome mug warmer on Amazon (https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer) that's been a game-changer for my daily routine.

Auto Shut-off Features
This is non-negotiable. We all get distracted, and having an auto shut-off feature isn't just about safety - it's about peace of mind. Plus, it saves energy!

Size and Portability
Consider where you'll use it most. I wanted something I could easily move between my home office and kitchen. The compact ones are great, but make sure they're stable enough to hold your favorite mug.

Additional Features Worth Considering:
- LED temperature display
- Waterproof design
- Long power cord
- Compatible mug types

After weeks of testing different options, I keep coming back to this particular model (https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer). It hits all the right notes in terms of functionality and price.

Budget Tips:
1. Look for seasonal sales
2. Check bundle deals
3. Read reviews carefully
4. Consider long-term durability over initial cost

Pro tip: Whatever you choose, make sure it's compatible with your existing mugs. Some warmers work better with flat-bottomed mugs, while others are more versatile.

I've been using mine for about six months now, and it's honestly one of those ""how did I live without this?"" purchases. No more cold coffee, no more constant trips to the microwave, and best of all, no more wasted drinks.

Remember, the cheapest option isn't always the most budget-friendly in the long run. I'd rather spend a bit more on something that'll last years than keep replacing a cheaper model every few months.

They created a profile and bio-data about me and started sharing it with all their contacts, all behind my back. A few weeks passed and my mum told me what she was doing and I felt really disappointed. Yes, I'm happy for my parents to find me a husband the halal way, but it's a huge break of trust to do it without even telling me first, right? 

That was back in January, it is now October and this entire search has been nothing but a waste of time.

My mum finds me matches of people that I have absolutely no interest in, and then forces me to have a conversation with them or arranges for a parental supervised date. She's doesn't let me choose, she will find a lad that matches her expectations and then askes me if I agree to meeting up. She's always saying that it's my choice but it definitely doesn't feel like my choice when she's shouting at me to agree because I'm getting old (I'm 22) and that no one's going to be with me if I'm picky. 

I definitely don't consider myself picky. I want someone who is emotionally mature, lives within 30 minutes of my local area, understands and agrees with my political beliefs and has a healthy work life balance. That's all, I don't actually care too much about what he does for work or appearance / height and I'd like to think my expectations for age and salary are more reasonable than most.

I feel as though this is all out of my control, literally next Saturday I've been forced to get the day off work so that I can meet another potential. I've already told my mum that I'm not interested in him yet I'm still going to be forced, yet again, to wear a big sparkly dress to a parental supervised date at a Costa Coffee, to put on a smile and pretend I'm interested in hearing about how this guy drone on about being interested in going to the gym and just had a crazy time in Dubai with his buddies. 

The summary of the matter is, I'm not against my parents finding me a husband. I am open to the idea of getting married, but I feel absolutely suffocated with the way my family is handling things. I'm not allowed to say no or I get told if. I'm not allowed to even choose the people meet. ",4,1759422463.0,Hijabis,5,0.84,False

30/F told me 30/F while we were in bed that she was meeting up with a guy from a group she attends for interview practice for an interview she has today. I had no issue whatsoever with her doing  so. 

Later on in the day I don’t hear from her for about 2 hours, I check her location I see she’s at the coffee shop which is cool. But after the coffee shop still no reply so being concerned I check her location again and she’s running errands going to stores and then ends up at an ice cream shop. 

He did pick her up for the meet up. And dropped her off . When I get home later that night she informs me that the lunch went good, he paid for her lunch. Then after the lunch they went to a couple stores and then went to an ice cream shop.. on top of that she told me that he offered to give her a ride to her interview today. I can’t cause I’m going to be at work. We also live long distance about 50 min apart. 

I’m making this post because with all that being said I ended up feeling super uncomfortable with it all. I feel like what I was told was going to be more business ended up being more personal? And then to tell me he’s also picking her up to take her to her interview. 

I don’t know if I’m just triggered from my past relationship of being cheated on by my ex with a man. Or if my feelings are valid of being a little upset with learning all of this later in the night instead of her having the consideration to let me know or to communicate that they were hanging out longer or that she told him that he can take her without talking to me about it. Not that she needs my permission but I guess it would’ve been nice to asked how I felt about the whole thing before just deciding to do it. 

I’m absolutely triggered and I’m well aware but yeah. She doesn’t feel like she did anything wrong. We do have trust and I don’t think she’d cheat on me but she doesn’t really know this guy besides seeing him in their group and getting a ride from him before and I don’t know him either nor his intentions. I feel like my feelings are valid but in the same sentence I’m questioning myself on if I’m just crazy. ",1,1759422368.0,lgbt,2,1.0,False

I've been on Adderall XR 20mg/day for a month, and 10mg the month before. For the first few days on each dose, I felt really weird and tweaky, but then it normalized, and I haven't had major side effects, just restlessness and increased HR during the peak times or when I drink caffeine, and difficulty sleeping if I take it too late in the day. 

However, I've been feeling worse for the past couple days- nausea, some anxiety, cold feet/hands (could be unrelated), worse appetite suppression, and much lower caffeine tolerance. Normally, I drink a 2-3 cups of coffee or tea in a day, and have for many years. I've always had a good tolerance, I never get jittery, anxious, etc., with caffeine, and even on Adderall I can normally have \~2 cups/day without feeling bad if I time it right. Yesterday, I tried twice to drink a cup of green tea, and started feeling shitty after just a couple sips- tachycardia (not faster than usual, but felt worse if that makes any sense?), palpitations, sweating, feeling generally weaker and unwell. 

Is it common for medications to suddenly have worse side effects than usual? I'm probably going off the meds when this prescription runs out anyway, so I suppose it's not that big a deal, but it just seems really weird.

Seeking I am… the holy grail of summer internships, preferably in the realm of cybersecurity.

I’ve got a decent foundation (uni projects, labs, some certs), but honestly feeling a bit lost on where to look and how to stand out. Most job boards feel like applying into the void, and I’m not sure if there are better ways to find opportunities—whether through Monash connections, specific companies that take interns, or hidden gems outside of LinkedIn/Seek.

So, wise ones of Monash Reddit:
	•	Where do you hunt for cybersec internships?
	•	Any particular companies that are intern-friendly for us final-year padawans?
	•	Should I just spam Seek/LinkedIn or is there a secret Monash-only portal hidden like the Room of Requirement?
	•	And how do you make your application stand out when everyone is basically shouting “pick me, I’m a team player and love coffee chats”? ☕🙃

I’m open to all tips, networking hacks, or even just motivational “You shall pass!” Gandalf-level energy.

*""It starts with a hum, but ends with a choice""*



**1\] The Encounter :**

A normal day, Ethan goes to college by metro. He boards the usual 7:45 AM train, and the compartment is empty, there are 3 people on that side of the compartment. There was a lady seated opposite to him, she starts humming. Ethan thinks that she was wearing AirPods, but she wasn’t. He felt kinda weird and avoided it, she stopped humming. Later, again she started humming, but this time it was loud… like loud, and then she stops it, he just looks at her, and to his horror that lady was staring right into his soul. He looked away, and later once again looked at her, and this time she was staring at him, now this scared him. He doesn’t know what to do, and by that time she took her phone out, Ethan knows that it wasn’t a good sign and he gets off of the train. Now, he started thinking about how the lady appeared, because he was traumatised. She was wearing a purple top, with black pants, pink handbag, a green phone, hair carelessly done, and she looked like she was in her forties. Ethan just tries to forget about it, and tells his experience to his friends and they laugh it off. He never knew what awaited him next.





**2\] The Mark :**

Eventually Ethan forgot about this lady and carried on with his college stuff, but all changes when he starts receiving weird texts from unknown numbers. He just avoids them because he doesn’t wanna take the risk of losing his data. He initially thought that they were some scammers trying to steal his data, he was so traumatised by that lady that if he hears someone hum he would go into “fight or flight” mode. Eventually, the text messages were no longer messages but just “na…na..na..” Ethan is disturbed now. He gets weird dreams in the night. He realised that he has fallen into some sort of trap.





**3\] The Pursuit :**

He was no longer imagining it. There were people watching him, not overtly but subtly. This disturbs him completely, random men smiling at him like they were familiar with him, women looking at him and whispering at each other. Then comes one night, Ethan left his college little late, and it’s twilight now, he was walking his way back and he hears someone humming, the same way the lady was humming, his heart started pounding faster, he looks back and sees no one. He reaches his house and his doorbell goes off. He comes out to find an envelope that had a black note written in silver ink which said

*“Join us or disappear”*

He doesn’t tell his parents, instead takes it to his room and keeps it on his table.





**4\] The Resonant Thread :**

He started searching, he found out that this envelope was sent by an organisation called “The Order Of The Six Tones” it was basically an underground cult founded decades ago, no known location. He eventually learned that they recruit people based on how they react to the Leader’s hum, i.e., they recruit through resonance. They usually target the “gifted”, musicians, empaths, dreamers or just people who are fractured enough to hear something others can’t. The Humming wasn’t music, it was Manipulation. He knew that he wasn’t chosen, he was claimed. There were 10 council members in the cult, and 50 members, but not all 60 showed up, only 7 were active in the cult’s activities. The cult’s main day was on September 13 of every year, where all the members and new people who were recruited by others would gather, Ethan was expected to attend that Grand Feast, which was just 2 days later.





**5\] The Gathering :**

Ethan decides to show up, he told his parents that he has special classes till 5 PM and goes to the meeting, he reached the building where the feast is supposed to happen, and he goes inside. The volunteer looks at him and nods, like he was expecting Ethan’s arrival. He goes to the hall, and finds the Council members seated in a semi circle, when he entered all the attention was towards him. The leader stood up and welcomed him. All of them wearing a purple shirt with a black overcoat, they eventually said that purple signifies royalty and rarity, hence purple is their cult’s uniform. Without further delay, the leader makes Ethan sit right next to her, and they begin their rituals. It was a dark setting, with candle lights, faint blue light, with strong humming. Ethan standing cluelessly, looks at the rest of the people. The ritual only lasted for an hour, and the leader asked everyone to be seated. They were given a grand meal, only time Ethan was thankful for what had happened that day, because the food was too good and he never had eaten food like that before. After the meal the leader goes up to him 

*“Take two days,” she said, her tone neither threatening nor pleading. “Listen to the world. If it sings to you… come back. If it doesn’t, walk away.”*





**6\] When the World Sings :**

The first day, he wakes up in the morning feeling better than ever. He goes to his college, a teacher who never knew about Ethan started praising about how attentive he was during the class. His friends are being nicer to him, on his way back home, he meets his friend after a long time, and she offers to go out and have a coffee with him. He thought of telling this to her, but he just didn’t. They had the best conversation so far, he feels incredible and goes to his house. Second day, he finds some money in his pocket which he doesn’t remember having. He goes to college, spends that money in the canteen and that day they had a surprise test, where he had done exceptionally well, again another teacher praises him for his marks. Everything felt so good, and tomorrow was the day, he is now unsure whether he has to be a part of it or not.





**7\] The Decision :**

He got ready, went to that place and the leader stood right there, almost as if she had been waiting the whole time. The leader stepped forward and hugged him. 

*“So,” she said softly, almost like a mother speaking to a child, “Tell me, Ethan… did the world sing to you?”*

 Ethan stood there, frozen. He thought of the past days: The praise, the test, the coffee, the laughter. Everything had been perfect… maybe too perfect. Was this destiny, or was it a trap? Would he ever know the difference? The leader’s hand rested gently on his shoulder, waiting. The entire council stared at him in silence. Ethan took a deep breath. When he finally spoke, the hum stopped. Whether he stayed or walked away… only the walls of that room knew.

Im looking to put together a little gift basket as a Christmas present of things we loved from my hike. Mostly for family who followed along closely. I want to incorporate little elements that really bring that feeling of being there. For example, I got some of the apple crumble from Julian's pies, a roller ball with the smell of pinyon pine, and sone coffee from my favorite coffee shop on trail.

I'd like to have a little representation from each section, but I'm really struggling with the Sierras. Its really hard to capture the views and the experience, but when I look up gift ideas I just get general Yosemite or Tahoe things from mass proucers. I'd rather support a local maker from the area and get something made with love. Im open to anything from stickers to candles to non-perishables to whatever, but I'd like to keep it >$20 because I'm gathering a lot (and trail was expensive 😅). If you know someone or have any suggestions please drop a link!

Also if anyone knows any huckleberry jam makers, I'm on the hunt for some of that too. Not the mass produced slap a Snoqualmie or Mt Hood sticker on the bottle kind that you see in every gift shop kind.

Edit edit: I clean after myself and try to buy myself something to eat when I can. I also help with some of the chores around the house 

I’m not sure if I’m the only one who’s experiencing this. I currently live in with my parents while I work a minimum wage job. I’ve been having a hard time finding a new better paying job. I gave the car away to my older sibling who now has 4 kids and a stepson. I’ve been getting rides to and from work. 

I’ve also been having a hard time buying myself things like groceries and cleaning products. I don’t seem to make enough and the rest goes towards bills and loan collectors. I’ve been able to stay on top of the rent. It’s rather frustrating for me to not have enough to even buy a meal sometimes. My stepmother charges me $200 each week.

I have a certain amount of money and I have a few different options. I could use it to buy groceries, I haven’t been able to buy myself groceries in weeks. When I run out of groceries they start to feed me old leftovers and molding food from the fridge. I’ve tried food pantries but they seem to give out expired food at least to my experience.  Or I could buy some hair and cleaning products. 

Lastly, pay rent. It’s my stepmother who’s charging me the rent. My father disagrees with it. She won’t budge, like she won’t excuse me for a week. It seems she’s still expecting rent. She doesn’t work a day job so it feels to me that she’s expecting well depending on the money that I give her. It’s hard for me, to have others be so dependant on me when I’m struggling myself. If I don’t pay her she has a reaction, moody, and she can’t pay things that are in her name. 

Literally, most of the time right after I pay her she goes shopping, comes back home with shopping bags. Walmart, dollar stores, fast food. While I feel like I’m not really able to buy much and wondering what I’m going to eat even today. It was different with my mother, at least she had a day job at a factory. She could support herself, she didn’t need my money. Actually any money I’d give to her she’d give it back. or I’d treat the both of us to dinner, morning coffee, etc.

Here’s what bothers me, they both don’t work actual jobs. They’re not getting ready and clocking in and working hours a day at job. Both of them are semi-retired so they’re spending nearly all their time sitting around at home. Aside from the finances, I also don’t really get space and privacy unless they go somewhere if they go somewhere. It’s a small one floor two bed house. Midwest 24f",5,1759421911.0,rant,79,0.86,False
