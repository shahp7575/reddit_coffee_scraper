At first I used the retractable WDT from MHW, 0,4mm. As you can see in the picture, the 0.4mm WDT doesn't break up the clumps very well. Now I use the 0.3mm needle from Sworksdesign. It breaks up the clumps better, but you have to take good care of it.



Now I clean it after every use. Just rinse it with warm water and clean it with high concentration isopropyl alcohol to remove coffee oils. If oils accumulate, the needle will become sticky and stain the coffee cake. Once a week, I soak it in Cafiza for 5 minutes and scrub it with a soft toothbrush. Be gentle, otherwise the needle will bend. I suffered the hard way the first time I used a WDT 😅. If it's made of steel, make sure to dry it thoroughly to prevent rust.



Storage is also important. I used to throw it in a drawer and the needle was bent. Now I put it on the stand, but if you have a retractable WDT, it doesn't matter. But be careful when using it, you must follow the instructions, otherwise it is easy to deform the needle in the retractable WDT.



Does anyone have other tips for using the WDT coffee needle? Or am I doing it a bit too much? 🤔

The Upper Park has blossomed into a destination for families, festivals, concerts, and casual hangouts. But every time I visit the Lower Park, I can't help but see **SO MUCH POTENTIAL** waiting to be tapped,  especially when it comes to much-needed housing and a quality grocery store.

Lower Scissortail is beautifully designed, with walking trails, green space, and riverfront access, but what it's missing is **the daily life infrastructure** that turns a public space into a neighborhood anchor. Imagine waking up in a thoughtfully designed apartment overlooking the park, grabbing coffee downstairs, and walking to pick up fresh produce and local goods at a grocery market built right into the community. It would elevate the entire urban core experience and connect with the momentum already happening nearby in the Wheeler District, Farmers Market District, and Capitol Hill.

We often discuss making OKC a ""15-minute city,"" where everything you need is within a short walk or bike ride. Lower Scissortail could be a **model for that kind of livable urban design**. It’s perfectly positioned to be a hub for new housing options, including affordable and market-rate options, paired with ground-floor retail, a community grocery, possibly even coworking spaces, and neighborhood services.

The park is there. The location is incredible. The demand is growing. Now it’s time for developers and city leaders to dream a little bigger for Lower Scissortail and make it a place where people don’t just visit — they live, shop, and build community.

How hard is it for you to stay afloat and sustain your business in today's Indian scenario?

I understand that India, despite not having a strong coffee culture apart from the southern region where coffee is cultivated, coffee industry is still pretty huge in terms of numbers alone.

However, it is also true that coffee , especially speciality coffee is extremely niche area.
Market is already saturated no matter what specific section of business you are in.
Whether it's hospitality and cafe business 
Or roasting... Everyday there are new cafes and roasters opening up in a market which is already saturated.

Even if we think about roasting machines or other parts of service B2B industry such as services and repairing of roaster machines and other related equipmens, it's already freakishly competitive.

Even the vendors and suppliers who are providing B2B are saturated with already established presence. I have a hunch even they still find it troublesome and have to keep Margins quite low.

So I wanted to ask and know about the inside of the industry. People who are directly involved.
How did you start your business, what kind of challenges did you face? What kind of challenges do you face now?
How do you think consumers can help in keeping the industry more accessible to small businesses and help them survive?

Still healing,"So on July 26 of last year, my stomach changed for the long haul earlier that month I had to have a leap procedure to remove pre-c cells off my cervix. 

In the same month, I was broken up with and had a lot of stress at work and I was also on antibiotics for a UTI and a toenail infection. 

On top of that, I have suspected that my refrigerator might have added to my gastritis because couple days ago I told the maintenance people to fix my refrigerator because it was not cooling properly. after I told him about my refrigerator, it miraculously was cooling properly however, thinking back it probably wasn’t so I was going to a music fest that day and I decided to drink some coffee and I poured myself some spoiled coffee creamer took a sip and spit it out immediately after that I ate a piece of toast, peanut butter, and a strawberry. I went to take a shower and an hour later I was on the floor in pain churning pain. It was it was like the pain was going around and round in a circle and I was very gassy and nauseous. 

I called my mother and she got me some crackers and Gingerale and I had to stay at the house for hours before going to the music fest even when I went to the music fest I still wasn’t feeling that great and I managed to eat a hot dog later that day. 

I thought I had some food poisoning and I could go back to business as usual but no my stomach was extremely irritated so a month later I’d let my doctor know about what happened and he suspected gastritis and possibly a stomach ulcer. 

He did not order an endoscopy and I wish I would’ve pushed for that right when I was experiencing soul crushing pain. 

He ended up putting me on PPI’s for about a month to reduce the stomach acid and let my stomach lining heal in that two month period. I ate as clean as I could ate very bland foods. I basically ate beans, mashed potatoes and chicken and as a treat, I would have M&M peanuts.


I ended my PPI journey on September 27 and my doctor told me that I can slowly incorporate other foods into my diet. 

Sometime in October, I have my first burger in months and it was so good and then in November I went to cheesecake factory, and eat pasta, but the pasta kinda irritated my stomach a little but it was nothing crazy. 

I went on vacation in early to mid December and I was able to eat out with my family. I was so happy to taste food again and I actually did gain weight over the past couple months. I gained about five or 6 pounds which I was very happy about that’s a good sign and nothing else is going on.

So from December up until late March, I was on the road to recovery, but I think I messed it up for myself. Here’s how.

On March 31, I went to a game night and and people brought food so I ate a combination of pizza. I ate brownies. I ate a banana pudding ate a lot of combinations in the next day. My stomach was very upset. Then a week later I was settled in my stomach wasn’t hurting anymore.

About two weeks later, I ended up eating a garlic burger from steak ‘n Shake in a burrito in the same day due to stress eating. I have a very high stress job and so that probably contributes to my stomach being bad right now. Anyway, after I ate the garlic burger in burrito, I had diarrhea, but I felt better two days after then I added more pain to my stomach by drinking an iced coffee on April 12 and the next day my stomach was irritated. I had a little burning sensation. I hate the Burling sensation feeling. 

So I got over to coffee flare, but add more pain to myself. I went to a happy hour four days later and had two drinks, but I had a lot of water in between those drinks and a lot of food. 

After the happy hour, I wasn’t feeling too bad. I did have a bowel movement the next day.

But then last week I had a sugar cookie at church. I was so happy to have it. It was for Easter Sunday, and then I walked over to Starbucks and had a parfait, and then my stomach flared up because of the sugar and fat intake.

After that flareup, I decided to slow down with the food but two days after a friend I was hanging out with one at pizza and I ended up eating six slices of pizza. So now I’ve been in slight irritation mode for the past four days and it’s really bothering me because I think I really messed up my stomach and I’m scared.


I feel bad writing this post because I really messed up. All I wanted to enjoy was food but with this type of thing I can’t really do it so for the next two weeks, I’m trying to eat as bland as I can and still stay sane before reaching out to my doctor with the endoscopy.

I just wanted one just to see what was down there. 

I know my doctor’s gonna ask me about my diet and since March 31, my diet has been absolute trash and now I’m dating and so I have the pressure of keeping up with the person I’m dating. He’s able to eat pizza he’s able to eat combinations and I’m not able to do that and I have to tell them that.

Also, has anyone had experiences with endoscopies? Did you sure did your insurance cover most of it? I don’t know they might find nothing down there, but are they just gonna put me on PPI’s? I really don’t wanna be on those things because they’re not good for long-term but I know people that take them long-term. I prefer not to I’m trying to look at natural remedies, but if I have to be on PPI for another month, I guess I can do that.

Last month I had Covid and so I had a huge ER bill because I had some odd symptoms of bleeding out of my V part but that end up being my period coming early. It’s just been a mess.

Also, I’m thinking about getting on anti-anxiety pills because I feel like stress has been a contributing factor to the way my stomach is feeling because last Friday it was really really stressful and it makes sense why I am in pain this week. 

Any advice, 33.

Age: 16

Description: Lithe and flexible like a dancer, “warrior” would not be the first label most would ascribe to Lino. Topped with a wild tangle of flaxen hair, his bright blue eyes are focused and intelligent, and take on a starry shine when he’s feeling passionate emotions.

His preferred style is boho-academic meets theater kid. This means Lino often wears layered scarves, vests, soft cardigans, and a small charm bracelet his father made with tiny symbols from various musical traditions (a lyre, treble clef, and a plectrum)
 
Appearance:

Height: 6 feet, 0 inches (183 cm)

Weight: 165 pounds (75 kg)

Hair color: Sandy leaning towards blonde

Eye color: Bright blue. They seem to shine when he’s feeling passionate.

Body type: Lean, slender, similar to a dancer.

Personality:

Lino is a gentle-hearted and introspective soul, defined by his artistic depth, emotional sensitivity, and quiet charisma. As the demigod son of Calliope, the Muse of Epic Poetry, Lino has a natural gift for storytelling, performance, and expression—yet he often doubts his own voice. Despite his talents, his fatal flaw of self-doubt weighs heavily on him, creating a quiet conflict between who he is and who he believes he should be.

Growing up with his grounded, disciplined father, Lino learned structure and passion in equal measure, particularly in music. His ADHD gives him bursts of energy and creativity that flow best when he's immersed in performance or poetic rhythm. He shines in moments when he can channel his emotions into art, often becoming the emotional anchor for those around him without realizing it.

Lino is deeply empathetic, sometimes to his own detriment. He tends to lift others up—sharing strength, confidence, or even skill through his demigod powers—but can struggle to advocate for himself. There’s a romantic, dreamy quality to him, amplified by his love of music, theater, and epics. He adores harmony—not just musical, but emotional and social—and feels most alive when he's connecting with others through shared moments of beauty and meaning.

He’s the kind of person who listens before he speaks, who notices when others are hurting, and who often hides his own pain behind a calm smile or a beautifully crafted lyric. But underneath that poetic exterior is a kid who still wants to know he’s enough—just as he is.

Trivia

Lino has a hobby of collecting antique pens and tiny notebooks. He writes fragments of overheard conversations and melodies in them.
 
Lino writes and plays music late at night when the camp is quiet.

Lino is often accompanied by a cheeky starling named “Echo” who mimics people it overhears the day.

Lino’s greatest ambition is to compose a musical epic that tells the stories of modern demigods—not as tragedy, but triumph.

History:

Lino was raised by his father Sandro, a classically trained musician and musical historian, in a quiet home filled with records, stringed instruments, and dusty shelves of scores and lyrical epics.

He was a quiet, dreamy child who struggled in school—constantly distracted, often zoning out during lectures or doodling lyrics on his worksheets. He showed a natural affinity for music early, mastering violin basics before age 8 and surprising his teachers by improvising melodies in response to emotions instead of just playing scales.

Lino always knew his mother was “special,” but Sandro only told him the truth when he was around 11, after a freak incident during a school musical performance (more on that in Awakening). During a school recital, Lino performed a solo piece he had rewritten to be more emotional. Mid-performance, the entire auditorium fell silent—not out of politeness, but as if compelled. Even the teachers reported being entranced. One substitute teacher ran out in a panic, revealing herself to be a disguised empousa.

That night, his father explained what really happened in Greece—the brief but intense romance with Calliope, and the truth about Lino’s heritage. 

Shortly after, Lino was targeted by two telekhines (sea-dog-like monsters) while walking home from the symphony with his father. He was rescued by a Hunter of Artemis who recognized him as divine-blooded. This encounter led to his first journey to Camp Half-Blood, though he didn’t become a full-time camper until the following summer when he was 13.

Initially overwhelmed by the loud, combat-centric energy of camp, Lino felt out of place among the more physical or boisterous demigods. Instead, he made a handful of friends in other ways, a daughter of Hypnos he met in the infirmary, a son of Apollo he teamed up with in a capture-the flag game, and a daughter of Athena who discovered his method of communication worked brilliantly in diplomacy.

He was claimed by Calliope after reciting an impromptu epic in the Amphitheater one evening—his words summoned glowing birds that circled him, and his mother’s voice whispered, “Your story has begun.”

Present Day:

Over the years, he’s become known as a soft-spoken counselor in training, often helping campers articulate their trauma or find beauty in their stories. He rarely spars, but when he performs, even Ares kids stop to listen.

He’s considered a “safe,” person, the one you go to when you’re emotionally raw or scared. Not every camper respects his quiet power at first, but those who do really recognize its strength.

Some combat-heavy campers see him as “soft,” but Lino never argues back—he just proves them wrong when it matters.

The Hermes cabin once played a prank that accidentally destroyed one of his lyric journals. They later left him an apology note and a brand-new leather-bound book—no name signed, but he knew.

Despite his success at Camp Half Blood Lino carries a lingering doubt—whether his powers, rooted in emotion and inspiration, are enough to make him a true hero. It is his fatal flaw rearing its dark head, self-doubt shaking his confidence and challenging his trust in himself.

Personal Actions at CHB

Frequently organizes evening campfires into emotionally powerful performances (epic storytelling, shadow plays with Memory Projection, group songwriting).

A go-to for mediation—Lino's calming presence makes him ideal in defusing conflicts or helping homesick campers.

Has a small fan base across cabins thanks to his natural charisma—though he doesn’t fully believe in it himself.

1k83y56,https://www.reddit.com/r/thepapinis/comments/1k83y56/sherri_papininow_a_homewrecker_too/,Sherri Papini...Now a homewrecker too!,"Part One.  

A little under a year ago my ‘husband’ came bouncing into the kitchen while I was making dinner.  “Did you see what I posted on Facebook today?”  One of his more endearing–and occasionally exhausting–qualities is his constant need for praise…Easy to give during the few years he was working an actual job, in an actual office, not so much when he’s showing off a page out of a coloring book he hijacked from our daughter or when he’s dancing around me, trying to get me to give him my full attention over a YouTube comment or quip he’s made on Facebook. 

“No,” I sigh and angle myself so I can keep one eye on the sizzling pans on the stovetop while assuring him he has my partial interest.  I’m trying to hide my annoyance–social media is NOT my thing.  Before we moved to this mountain-town in Northern California, my job was manipulating Social Media and Search Engines, now, utterly removed from “all that is interesting” in a tiny, remote, town in the politically conservative Shasta County where the per capita income is (a little under) $39,000, the *last* thing I care about is who’s doing or saying what on Facebook.  But the night will go easier if I feign interest.  He’s just started drinking so his mood is up, if the kid and I tread carefully he’ll pass out still in a good mood without drinking himself into “the dark side.”  

“So you know Sheri Papini?” he asks.  I shake my head no.  “You know,” he whines, “the pretty, blonde, mom from Redding, who KIDNAPPED HERSELF and blamed it on Mexicans?”  

That *sort of* rings a bell.  “Okaaaay,” I say.    

“So she’s moving to Shingletown.  To SHINGLETOWN!”  

“Alright,” I say.  He looks stricken, I’m obviously not ‘getting it.’  

“So I’m on a page for a group that doesn’t want her to move up here,”

“That’s mean,” I interject.

“Yeah, well, listen to my jokes: I said that Pioneer Pizza should make a special Sheri Papii menu and the first pizza on it will be a Mexican pizza but when you order it, there’s no Mexican toppings–it’s just pepperoni and cheese!”

I’m mentally adding up cooking times when I realize he’s waiting on a reaction from me.  “Oh!  Ha ha, that’s funny,” I try.

He lights up.  “Yeah!  And I’ve already got 17 likes!”

“That’s awesome,” I say.  It worked.  He’s all smiles as he skips past our daughter on the couch and calls out “Your dad is going viral!”  Hearing her ‘dad’ happy, our daughter automatically raises her hand without taking her eyes off the t.v.  Her dad slaps her five as he sails past her, back to ‘his spot’ on the porch where a sweating glass of whiskey and 7up waits next to a Swisher Sweet in the ashtray.

Fast forward to September of 2024.  My only friend in this town has stopped by, with her kids, to do laundry at our house.  Tony comes home from the bar and instead of being furious about me having company over, he’s weirdly amicable with my friend.  All three of us sit outside while my friend and Tony continue drinking together.  After jumping through some difficult topics between the two of them (one of Tony’s may ‘personal enemies’ is her ‘husband’) the conversation sways to open marriages.  Tony says, “Listen, Kat’s brought it up before–that if I wanted to “step out” on her, I just have to be honest about it…Clear the person with her first.  But I’m happy.  I’m secure enough in myself that I can take care of myself in *that way* if she’s not wanting to.  And am I going to get jealous if some country dude with no teeth gives her a compliment?  The way she looks now, I’m going to be happy for her.  After sixteen years, I hope she gets a little attention. It’s not like I’m going to get drunk at the bar and trip and my dick falls into some other chick but even that, we’d work through, right Kat?”

I nod and smile–working my mental gymnastics to hide that I actually want to cry over the insult to my looks hidden in his boast about our “healthy relationship.” 

One week later, we’re at a community event.  As always, I’m the face painter for the kids (and the occasional drunk grownup who comes to my table).  Tony is playing bartender and becoming one of the drunk grownups at the scene.  There’s whispers that Sherri Papini is there with her parents.  I’ve already forgotten the name, so I don’t think twice about wrapping things up once most of the families with kids have left.  My daughter runs over to tell her dad we’re leaving and we head home.  When we get back, I ask my daughter what she wants for dinner–I figure its just going to be the two of us, since after hours of day drinking with his Clamper friends, there’s no way Tony will be home before midnight–he’ll definitely be going to one of the nearby “Clamper Approved” bars for the rest of the night.

Thus, I was mildly surprised to hear his truck pull up an hour or so later.  Figuring he left something, I meet him in the living room. 

“You’re not going to believe who I just met!” he yells, as he runs up to me.  

“Who?”

“Sherri fucking Papini!”  Seeing my ‘who? face’ he adds, “the super hot chick who kidnapped herself and blamed it on the Mexicans and now lives in a mansion in Shingletown.”

“Oh, riiiiiiiiight,” I say, “tell me about i–”

He’s too excited to let me finish, “So, she was at the event with her parents who live here, too. So I see her and I’m like, I’m going to go talk to her.  So I go up to her and say–” suddenly he stops and I can see his drunk-brain churning behind his eyes.  

Uh oh.  Something’s wrong.  But, I smile and give him an encouraging, “Go on…”

I can watch him make the decision to just say what he’s afraid to tell me, “So I go up to her and I say, “Hi I’m Tony Bickel.  Are you new here?  Because I practically run this place and I haven’t seen you around before.  So she introduces herself and we chat a little and then she says, “Don’t you know who I am?!” So I say, “the prettiest girl in Shingletown?” and I made her laugh, Kat.  But I had to pretend I didn’t know who she is.  And now I’m going to go to her house and fix a doorknob for her.  I mean, she could *totally* do it herself…You know, she’s like you were when I met you–like, super independent and …” 

	 He’s at a loss for words.  “Capable?” I offer.

“Yes!” he breaks into a huge grin.  “Okay, I’m off to the bar.”

	“Should I fix a plate for you?” I ask, once again deciding to hide my hurt (this time at the compliment he gave her and then told me about).  

	“I don’t care,” he shouts from over his shoulder, he’s already bounding down the front steps, “Do whatever you like.” \*  

	I wrapped up a plate for him and stored it in the microwave, as per usual.  But I went to bed that night questioning our relationship and even more uneasy than usual.  

	A few days later was our Pearl Harbor (as I’ve come to think about it).  It was a normal day, I can’t even remember if it was a weekday or not.  But in the afternoon, he casually said, “I’m heading out, but I’ll probably be back in an hour.”

	“Where you going?” I asked.

	“Oh, over to Sherri’s house to fix that doorknob,” he muttered as he pulled on one of his ‘nice shirts.’  

	“Um, okaaaay.  Are you sure you should be doing this?  Is she going to pay you to, what? Install a doorknob?!” I asked–stupidly worrying about money, about him doing work for free–not about the bigger picture.  

	“Yeah, the dumb bitch is giving me $300 for it!”

	“Wait, what?!?” I ask, incredulous.

	“Yeah, well its the doorknob and like three planks of flooring that she needs help fitting.  Plus, I’m going to size up a job for me and \[his flooring friend\] that she might need our help with.”

	“Is \[flooring friend\] going to be there?” I ask.

	We play a short game of “he can’t hear me” and I repeat the question. “Yeah, he’s going to meet me over there,”  he replies, looking me dead in the eyes.

I stifle my sigh of relief and tell myself I *have* to watch the Hulu documentary on her–things are getting a little too close for comfort.

	Four hours later, he hasn’t come home and I haven’t heard bupkiss from him.   I finally reach out with a text that gets read but goes unanswered.  At the fifth hour, our daughter is crawling out of her skin in excitement.  (She was present during the initial “Sherri” conversation and this afternoon’s as he was leaving.)  She’s been running around announcing that “He’s effing her” and “She’s effing him” for the past hour–much to my chagrin. I assure her he’s probably at the bar or \[flooring guy’s\] house.  Two more hours pass before I hear his truck pull up.  My daughter comes running out of her bedroom to witness the drama.  I send her back, hating myself for already letting her get exposed to “too much.”

	Tony walks in.  Usually at this hour, he’d be swaying and slurring.  He is surprisingly sober.  My stomach drops.  

	He sits down across from me and starts taking his boots off.  He is positively glowing.  “Oh my God,” he begins, “Kat, you are not going to believe me about this girl.”  I’m afraid to answer, my limbs feel numb and I’m afraid my voice is going to sound shaky when I speak, so I smile at him and gesture for him to continue.

	“So, first off, she totally *didn’t* kidnap herself. “

	I’ve taken a sip of coffee and I nearly choke on it.  I admit I still hadn’t put any effort into looking her up–aside from seeing her photo on the Hulu documentary–but even I know she was actually prosecuted (and jailed) for her kidnapping hoax…Now, a few hours in her presence and he’s convinced she’s an innocent victim?!  The guy who’s taken numerous criminology classes (his dad and brother are both cops–he’s applied and been rejected several times to various law enforcement agencies) actually thinks, what…that the prosecutor's office and a jury of his peers are just idiots?!?  I wisely keep my mouth shut.

	“And the child abuse thing?” he looks at me expectantly but I shake my head.  I’m thinking, “child abuse thing!?” what child abuse was there?  I thought she just kidnapped *herself*. 

He explains, “So Keith really was abusing her and to try to get rid of her he had the kids say she made them wear satchels of rubbing alcohol around their necks–but *really* it was just Vick’s Vapor rub that she gave them when they were sick.”

	""Oh, that sucks,” I manage.

	He nods, happily, and continues, “Yeah, she’s been completely exonerated.  Like, even the Sheriff’s office has apologized to her and she and Sheriff Bosenko are super tight.  She’s, like, a victims’ advocate now.  Like, she’s the person the FBI calls in when someone has been kidnapped and recovered and she’s there to support them and make sure that they’re being treated right.”

	“I’m sorry,” I interject, “Are you saying Sherri *Papini* says she’s a victim’s advocate?”

	“Yes!” he exclaimed, he didn’t even miss a beat, “And she travels to universities giving speeches about police training and victim blaming…She’s *so amazing*!”

	At this point, I couldn’t hide my incredulity any longer.  I started laughing, “Tony,” I said in between gulps of air, “Don’t tell me you think that someone gets kidnapped.  The police find them, and after they’ve just been through the most harrowing experience of their life, a policeman or psychologist turns to them and says, “Miss, there’s someone you should really talk to–she’s going to help you get through all this…” and its Sherri-fucking-I-kidnapped-myself Papini?!”  I think I added jazz hands for effect.  “I mean, c’mon!?”

	“Nevermind.  I *knew* you were going to be a cunt about this.”  

	“Don’t call Mommy a cunt,” came a little voice behind me. 

	“Hey, you!  Bedtime,” I start but he interrupts me, “Mommy’s not a cunt but she’s also not being very nice.”  

	“Okay, I’ll be nice, please continue, by all means,” I quip.

	“Well, so she’s working on an HBO special and they’re putting *so much money* into it, it’s going to make Keith’s Hulu bullshit look pathetic.  And she’s like always on the phone and emailing with her manager and I swear, Kat, I think I’m going to get her to hire me instead.  Like with my T.V. experience, I’d be so good at that!”  (His “t.v. experience” is running the annual auction that the local PBS station put on every year–for three years.)  

	“And we were dancing to the Eminem song that talks about her, and Eminem told her that once she’s publicly exonerated, that he’s going to do this big apology to her and bring her on tour with him and, like, bring her on stage every night to publicly apologize for defaming her.”

	He’s looking at me like he wants a reaction.  I’m sitting very still doing everything in my power not to laugh, not to get him angry, because I can tell he *REALLY BELIEVES ALL THIS*.  I search for something neutral–the best I can come up with is, “So did you guys talk about the kidnapping, then?”

	“No,” he answers, “Not yet.  I’ve got to go erase all my online comments.  She still thinks I don’t know who she is, that I haven’t heard anything about her or the case,” he’s gotten up and is heading towards his room, “Did you make dinner?”

	“Yes, just the chicken alfredo pasta with peas, though.”

	“Gross,” he replies and scurries off to spend the night erasing all history of his online Sherri Papini bashing.  

	My daughter and I had a whispered, frenzied conversation with a lot of “I don’t know’s” from me thrown in.  I guess I was hoping it was still just a fluke…that he wouldn’t take it farther.  Boy, was I wrong.  



\* That’s pretty much the answer I get everyday when I call him at the bar.  Ever since Covid, our days look pretty much the same…On the days when he works for his friend with a flooring business, the kid and I don’t see him until midnight or later.  Occasionally he comes home for dinner, but he spends his home time outside in his “porch throne” on the phone with friends or glued to YouTube and Facebook.  He eats in his room, while the child and I are in the living room, or when he’s done drinking.  Homework is between the two of us at the table and the bedtime routine is also just the two of us.  He DOES take her to the morning bus stop, almost every day, and every few weeks spends a Saturday or Sunday afternoon coloring with her or taking her and a friend to the movies or playing a game they invented where they lay on the big bed together with a bucket of toys and guess the toy the other one picked based on touch alone.  

  
I'll post part two later -- it features domestic violence and me and the little one fending for ourselves for the next six months.

I'm also starting a GoFundMe since Tony has only given us $350 (He gave us $100 a week after he left and last month gave us $250 out of the blue) but I've spent thousands keeping us (and the cats) sheltered, clothed and fed all while keeping our daughter local in case her dad came to his senses (or his parents) and wanted to see her--but also to keep her in her wonderful school since NOTHING else was stable after this.

It’s problematic to assume that all Reform Jews fit these traits. It’s also offensive to assume that ONLY reform Jews like and have ownership over these things.

*“You’re telling me they didn’t steal…anything? Nothing at all?”*

The man’s bloodshot eyes had begun to glaze over. Flashing red and blue lights illuminated his face, cleaving through the thick darkness of my secluded front lawn.

Maybe I should have lied.

*“Well…no. I mean, I haven’t exactly taken a full inventory of my stuff yet, but it doesn’t seem like anything is missing…”*

The cop cleared his throat, cutting me off. A loud, phlegm-steeped crackle emanated from the depths of his tree trunk sized throat. Without taking a breath, he smoothly transitioned the sputtering noise into a series of followup questions.

*“Let me make sure I’m getting this right, buddy: you woke to the sound of burglars just…moving your furniture around? That’s it? I’m supposed to believe that a roving band of renegade interior decorators broke in to, what…open up the space a bit? Adjust the Feng Shui?*

He looked over his shoulder and gave his partner an impish grin. The other officer, an older man with rows of cigarette-stained teeth, responded to his impromptu standup routine with a raspy croak, which was either a chuckle or a wheeze. I assumed chuckle, but he wasn’t smiling, so it was hard to say for certain.

My chest began to fill with all-too familiar heat. I forced a smile, fists clenched tightly at my sides.

*Let’s try this one more time,* I thought.

*“I can’t speak to their intent, sir. And that’s not what I said. I didn't hear them move the furniture. I woke up to the sound of music playing downstairs. As I snuck over to the landing, I saw a flash, followed by a whirring noise. It startled me, so I stepped back, and the floorboards creaked.”*

The cop-turned-comic appeared to drop the act. His smile fell away, and he started to jot something down on his notepad as I recounted the experience. I was relieved to be taken seriously. The rising inferno in my chest cooled, but didn’t completely abate: it went from Mount Vesuvius moments before volcanic eruption to an overcooked microwave dinner, molten contents bubbling up against the plastic packaging.

*“I guess they heard the creak, because the music abruptly stopped. Then multiple sets of feet shuffled through the living room. By the time I got to the bannister and looked over, though, they had vanished. That’s when I noticed all the furniture had been rearranged. I think they left through the back door, because I found it unlocked. Must have forgotten to secure the damn thing.”*

*“Hmm…”* he said, staring at the notepad, scratching his chin and mulling it over. After a few seconds, he lifted the notepad up to his partner, who responded with an affirmative nod.

*“What do you think? Has this happened to anyone else closer to town?”* I asked, impatient to learn what he’d written.

*“Oh, uh…no, probably not.”* He snorted. *“I have an important question, though.”*

His impish grin returned. Even the older cop’s previously stoic lips couldn’t help but twist into a tiny smirk.

*“What song was it?”*

Seething anger clawed at the back of my eyeballs.

*“My Dark Star by The London Suede,”* I replied automatically.

*“Huh, I don’t know that one,”* said the younger cop, clearly holding back a bout of uproarious laughter.

In that moment, the worst part wasn’t actually the utter disinterest and dismissal. It was that, like the cop, I’d never listened to that song before last night. Didn’t know any other tracks by *The London Suede*, either. So, for the life of me, I couldn’t understand how those words spilled from my lips.

I’d google the track once they left. It *was* what I heard.

Anyway, the cop then presented his notepad, tapping his pen against the paper.

*“These were my guesses.”*

In scribbled ink, it read *“Bad Romance? The Macarena?”*

It took restraint not to slap the notepad out of his hand.

God, I wanted to, but it would have been counterproductive to add *assaulting a lawman* to my already long list of pending felonies. Criminality was how I landed myself out here in Podunk corn-country to begin with, nearly divorced and with a savings account emptier than church pews on December 26th.

So, I settled for screaming a few questions of my own at the younger of the two men.

For example: I inquired about the safety of this backcountry town’s tap water, speculating that high mercury levels must have irreparably damaged his brain as a child. Then, I asked if his wife had suffered a similar fate. I figured there were good odds that she also drank from the tap, given that she was likely his sister.

Those weren’t the *exact* words I yelled as those neanderthals trudged back to their cruiser.

But you get the idea.

\- - - - -

No matter how much bottom-shelf whiskey I drank, sleep would not come.

Once dawn broke, I gave up, rolled out of bed, and drunkly stumbled downstairs to heave my furniture to its previous location. I didn’t necessarily *need* to move it all: my plan was to only be in that two-story fixer-upper long enough to perform some renovations and make it marketable. In the meantime, I wasn’t expecting company, and it wasn’t like the intruders left my furnishings in an awkward pile at the center of the room. They shifted everything around, but it all remained usable.

I couldn’t stand the sight of it, though. It was a reminder that I plain didn’t understand *why* anyone would break in to play music and move some furniture around.

So, with some proverbial gas in the tank (two stale bagels, a cup of black coffee, additional whiskey), I got back to work. The quicker I returned to renovating, the quicker I could sell this godforsaken property. I purchased it *way* below market-value, so I was poised to make a pretty penny off of it.

Blair would eat her words. She’d see that I could maintain our “standard of living”, even without my lucrative corporate position and the even more lucrative insider trading. It wouldn’t be the same, but Thomas and her would be comfortable.

After all, I was a man. I *am* a man. I deserved a family.

More than that, I couldn’t endure the thought of being even more alone.

If that was even possible.

\- - - -

*How did they do all this without waking me up?* I contemplated, struggling to haul my cheap leather sofa across the room, its legs audibly digging into walnut-hardwood flooring.

I dropped the sectional with a gasp as a sharp pain detonated in my low back. The sofa slammed against the floor, and the sound of that collision reverberated through the relatively empty house.

Silence dripped back incrementally, although the barbershop quartet of herniated vertebral discs stacked together in my lumbar spine continued to sing and howl.

*“Close enough.”* I said out loud, panting between the words. My heart pounded and my head throbbed. Sobriety was tightening its skeletal hand around my neck: I was overdue for a dose of spirits to ward off that looming specter.

I left the couch in the center of the cavernous room, positioned diagonally with its seats towards a massive gallery of windows present on the front of the house, rather than facing the TV. A coffee table and a loveseat ended up sequestered tightly into the corner opposite the stairs, next to the hallway that led to the back door. Honestly, the arrangement looked much more insane after I tried to fix it, because I stopped halfway through.

I figured I could make another attempt after a drink.

So, the sweet lure of ethanol drew my feet forward, and that’s when I noticed it. A small, unassuming square of plastic, peeking out from under the couch. I don’t know exactly where it came from; perhaps it was hidden under something initially, or maybe I dislodged it from a sofa crease as I moved it.

Honestly, I tried to walk past it with looking. But the combination of dread and curiosity is a potent mixture, powerful enough to even quiet my simmering alcohol withdrawal.

With one hand bracing the small of my aching back, the other picked it up and flipped it over.

It was a polaroid.

The sofa was centered in the frame, and it was the dead of night.

When I arrived two weeks ago, I had the movers place the sofa against the wall. That wasn’t where it was in the picture. I could tell because the moon was visible through the massive windows above the group of people sitting on it.

At least, I think it was a group of people. I mean, the silhouettes were undoubtedly people-shaped.

But I couldn’t see any of their details.

The picture wasn’t poorly taken or blurry. It was well lit, too: I could appreciate the subtle ridges in the furniture's wooden armrests, as well as a splotchy wine stain present on the upholstery.

The flash perfectly illuminated everything, except for them.

Their frames were just…dark and jagged, like they had been scratched out with a pencil from *within* the picture. It was hard to tell where one form ended and another began. They overlapped, their torsos and arms congealing with each other. Taken together, they looked like an oversized accordion compromised of many segmented, human-looking shadows.

Not only that, but there was something intensely unnerving about the proportions of the picture. The sofa appeared significantly larger. I counted the heads. I recounted them, because I didn’t believe the number I came up with.

*Thirty-four*.

My hands trembled. A bout of nausea growled in my stomach.

Then, out of nowhere, a violent, searing pain exploded over the tips of my fingers where they were making contact with the polaroid. It felt similar to a burn, but that wasn’t exactly it. More like the stinging sensation of putting an ungloved hand into a mound of snow.

The polaroid fell out of my grasp. As it drifted towards the floor, I heard something coming from the hallway that led to the house’s back door. A distant melody that I had only heard once before last night, and yet I knew it by heart.

*“But she will come from India with a love in her eyes*  
*That say, ‘Oh, how my dark star will rise,’*  
*Oh, how my dark star, oh, how my dark star*  
*Oh, how my dark star will rise.”*

Terror left me frozen. I listened without moving an inch. By the time it ended, I was drenched with sweat, my skin coated in a layer of icy brine.

After a brief pause, the song just started over again.

My head became filled with visions. A group of teenagers right outside the backdoor, maybe the same ones who had broken in last night, playing the song and laughing under their breaths. Maybe the cop was there too, having been in on the entire scheme. Perhaps Blair hired them to harass me. The custody hearing was only weeks away. The more unstable I was, the more likely she’d get full custody of Thomas.

They were all out to prove I was a pathetic, wasted mess.

Of course, that was all paranoid nonsense, and none of that accounted for the polaroid.

I stomped around the couch, past the other furniture, down the narrow hallway, and wildly swung the door open.

\*“\****Who, THE FUCK, are…”***

My scream quickly collapsed. I stood on the edge of the first of three rickety steps that led into the backyard, scanning for the source of the song.

A few birds cawed and rustled in the pine trees that circled the house’s perimeter, no doubt startled by my tantrum. Otherwise, nature was still, and no one was there.

My fury dissipated. Logic found its way back to me.

Why was I expecting anyone to be there? The nearest house is a half-mile away. Blair wouldn’t hire anyone to torment me in such an astoundingly peculiar way, either. One, she wasn’t creative enough, and two, she wasn’t truly malicious. My former affluence was the foundation of our marriage. I knew that ahead of time. Once it was gone, of course she wanted out.

Before I could spiral into the black pits of self-loathing, a familiar hideaway, my ears perked.

The song was still playing. It sounded closer now.

But it wasn’t coming from outside the house like I’d thought.

\- - - - -

*Laundry room, bathroom, guest room. Laundry room, bathroom, guest room…*

No matter how much I racked my brain, nothing was coming to mind.

You see, there were three rooms that split off from the hallway that led to the backyard. From the perspective of the backdoor, the laundry room and the bathroom were on the left, and the guest room was on the right, directly across the laundry room.

*Maybe I’m just forgetting the layout. I haven’t been here that long, after all.*

I remembered there being three rooms, but I was looking at four doors, and the muffled sounds of *”My Dark Star”* were coming from the room I couldn’t remember.

My palm lingered on the doorknob. Despite multiple commands, my hand wouldn’t obey. I couldn’t overcome my fear. Eventually, though, I found a mantra that did the trick. Three little words that have bedeviled humanity since its inception: a universal fuel, having ignited the smallest of brutalities to the most pervasive, wide-reaching atrocities over our shared history.

*Be a man.*

*Be a man.*

***Be a man.***

My hand twisted, and I pushed the door open.

The room was tiny, no more than two hundred square feet by my estimation. Barren, too. There was nothing inside except flaking yellow wallpaper and the unmistakable odor of mold, damp and earthy.

But I could still hear *My Dark Star*, clearer than ever before. The sound was rough and crackling, like it was being played from vinyl that was littered with innumerable scratches.

I tiptoed inside.

It was difficult to pinpoint *precisely* where the song was coming from. So, I put an ear to each wall and listened.

When I placed my head on the wall farthest from the door, I knew I was getting close. The tone was sharper. The lyrics were crisp and punctuated. I could practically feel the plaster vibrate along with the bass.

I stepped back to fully examine the wall, trying to and failing to comprehend the phenomena. There was barely any hollow space behind it. Not enough to fit a sound system or a record player, that's for certain. If I took a sledgehammer to the plaster, I would just create a hole looking out into the backyard.

I stared at the decaying wallpaper, dumbfounded. I dragged my eyes over the crumbling surface, again and again, but no epiphany came. All the while, the song kept looping.

On what must have been the twentieth re-examination, my gaze finally hooked into something new. There was a faint sliver of darkness that ran the length of the wall, from ceiling to floor, next to the corner of the room.

A crack of sorts.

I cautiously walked towards it. Every step closer seemed to make the crack expand. Once my eyes were nearly touching it, the crevice had stretched from the width of a sheet of paper to that of a shot glass.

Somehow, I wasn’t fearful. My time in that false room had a dream-like quality to it. Surreal to the point where it disarmed me. Like it all wasn’t real, so I could wake up at any moment, safe and sound.

The edges of the fissure rippled, vibrating like a plucked guitar string. Soon after, I felt light tapping on the top of my boots. I tilted my head down.

Essentially, the wall coughed up a dozen more polaroids. They settled harmlessly at my feet.

The ones that landed picture-up were nearly identical to one I discovered in the living room, with small exceptions. Less scratched-out people, a different couch, more stars visible through the windows in the background, to name a few examples. The overturned polaroids had dates written on them in red sharpie, the earliest of which being September of 1996.

When I shifted my head back to the crevice, it found it had expanded further. I stared into the black maw as *My Dark Star* faded out once again, and I could see something.

There were hundreds of polaroids wedged deeper within the wall, and the gap had grown nearly big enough for me to fit my head through.

Long-belated panic stampeded over my skin, each nerve buzzing with savage thunder.

I turned and bolted, flinging the door shut behind me.

Racing through the narrow hallway, I peered over my shoulder, concerned that I was being chased.

Nothing was in pursuit, but there had been a change.

Now, there were only three total doors:

Laundry room, bathroom, guest room.

\- - - - -

I have a hard time recalling the following handful of hours. It’s all a haze. I know I considered leaving. I remember sobbing. I very much remember drinking. I tried to call Blair, but when I heard Thomas’s voice pick up the line, I immediately hung up, mind-shatteringly embarrassed. I didn’t call the police, for obvious reasons.

The order in which that all happened remains a bit of a mystery to me, but, in the end, I suppose it doesn’t really matter.

Here’s the bottom line:

I drank enough to pass out.

When the stupor abated and my eyes lurched open, I found myself on a sofa, propped upright.

Not angled in the middle of the room where I had left mine, either.

This one had its back to the windows.

\- - - - -

The scene I awoke to was more perplexing than it was hellish.

The living room was absolutely saturated with objects I didn’t recognize - knickknacks, framed photos, watercolor paintings, ornamented mirrors. A citrusy aroma wafted through the air, floral but acidic. There were the sounds of lively chatter around me, but as I sat up and glanced around, I didn’t see anyone. Not a soul.

I was about to stand up, but I heard the click of a record player needle connecting with vinyl. The sharp noise somehow rooted me to the fabric.

*My Dark Star* began playing in the background.

When I turned forward, there he was. Materialized from God knows where.

He appeared older than me by a decade or so, maybe in his late fifties. The man sported a cheap, ill-fitting blue checkered suit jacket with black chinos. His face held a warm smile and a pair of those New Year’s Eve novelty glasses, blue eyes peeking through the circles of the two number-nines in 1995.

The figure stared at me, lifted a finger to the corner of his mouth, and waited.

I knew what he wanted. Without thinking, I obliged.

I smiled too.

He nodded, brought a camera up to his eye, and snapped a polaroid.

The flash of light was blinding. For a few seconds, all I could see was white. Screams erupted around me, erasing the pleasant racket of a party. Then, I heard the roaring crackle of a fire.

Slowly, my whiteout faded. The clamor of death quieted in tandem. My surroundings returned to normal, too. No more knickknacks or family photos: just a vacant, depressing, unrenovated home.

The man was also gone, but something replaced him. Like the scratched-out people, it was human-shaped, but it had much more definition. A seven-foot tall, thickly-built stick figure looming motionless in front of me. If there was a person under there, I couldn’t tell. If it had skin, I couldn’t see it.

All I could appreciate were the polaroids.

Thousands of nearly identical images seemed to form its body. They jutted out of the entity at chaotic-looking angles: reptilian scales that had become progressively overcrowded, each one now fighting to maintain a tenuous connection to the flesh hidden somewhere underneath.

It didn’t have fingers. Instead, the plastic squares formed a kind of rudimentary claw. Two-thirds down the arms, its upper extremities bifurcated into a pair of saucer-shaped, plate-sized digits.

I watched as the right arm curved towards its belly. The motion was rigid and mechanical, and it was accompanied by the squeaking of plastic rubbing against plastic. It grasped a single picture at the tip of its claw. Assumably the one that had just been taken.

The one that included me.

When it got close, a cluster of photographs on its torso began to rumble and shake. Seconds later, a long, black tongue slithered out between the cramped folds. The tongue writhed over the new picture, manically licking it until it was covered in gray-yellow saliva.

Then, the tongue receded back into its abdomen, like an earthworm into the soil. Once it had vanished, the entity creaked its right arm at the elbow so it could reach its chest, pushing the polaroid against its sternum.

The claw pulled back, and it stuck.

Another for the collection.

An icy grip clamped down on my wrist.

I turned my head. There was a scratched-out, colorless hand over mine.

My eyes traced the appendage up to its origin, but they didn’t need to. I already knew what I was about to see.

The sofa seemed to stretch on for miles.

Countless scratched-out heads turned to face me, creating a wave down the line. Everyone wanted to see the newcomer, even the oldest shadows at the very, very end.

I did not feel terror.

I experienced a medley of distinct sensations, but none of them were negative.

Peace. Comfort. Fufillment.

Safety. Appreciation.

Love.

Ever since the polaroid snapped, I’ve been smiling.

I can't stop.

\- - - - -

Blair, I hope you see this.

The door is fully open for me now, and I may not return.

You can have everything.

The house, the money, the cars.

You can keep Thomas, too.

I don’t need you, I don’t need him, I don’t need any of it.

I’ve found an unconditional love.

I hope someday you find one, too.

If you ever need to find *me*, well,

You know where to go, but I’ll tell you *when* to go.

11:58 PM, every night.

If you decide to come out here, bring Thomas.

1k83vrc,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1k83vrc/blair_this_is_finn_a_group_of_people_broke_into/,"Blair, this is Finn. A group of people broke into my house last night, but nothing was stolen. You can have everything. I don't think I'm coming home.","
*“You’re telling me they didn’t steal…anything? Nothing at all?”*

The man’s bloodshot eyes had begun to glaze over. Flashing red and blue lights illuminated his face, cleaving through the thick darkness of my secluded front lawn.

Maybe I should have lied.

*“Well…no. I mean, I haven’t exactly taken a full inventory of my stuff yet, but it doesn’t seem like anything is missing…”*

The cop cleared his throat, cutting me off. A loud, phlegm-steeped crackle emanated from the depths of his tree trunk sized throat. Without taking a breath, he smoothly transitioned the sputtering noise into a series of followup questions.

*“Let me make sure I’m getting this right, buddy: you woke to the sound of burglars just…moving your furniture around? That’s it? I’m supposed to believe that a roving band of renegade interior decorators broke in to, what…open up the space a bit? Adjust the Feng Shui?*

He looked over his shoulder and gave his partner an impish grin. The other officer, an older man with rows of cigarette-stained teeth, responded to his impromptu standup routine with a raspy croak, which was either a chuckle or a wheeze. I assumed chuckle, but he wasn’t smiling, so it was hard to say for certain.

My chest began to fill with all-too familiar heat. I forced a smile, fists clenched tightly at my sides.

*Let’s try this one more time,* I thought.

*“I can’t speak to their intent, sir. And that’s not what I said. I didn't hear them move the furniture. I woke up to the sound of music playing downstairs. As I snuck over to the landing, I saw a flash, followed by a whirring noise. It startled me, so I stepped back, and the floorboards creaked.”*

The cop-turned-comic appeared to drop the act. His smile fell away, and he started to jot something down on his notepad as I recounted the experience. I was relieved to be taken seriously. The rising inferno in my chest cooled, but didn’t completely abate: it went from Mount Vesuvius moments before volcanic eruption to an overcooked microwave dinner, molten contents bubbling up against the plastic packaging.

*“I guess they heard the creak, because the music abruptly stopped. Then multiple sets of feet shuffled through the living room. By the time I got to the bannister and looked over, though, they had vanished. That’s when I noticed all the furniture had been rearranged. I think they left through the back door, because I found it unlocked. Must have forgotten to secure the damn thing.”*

*“Hmm…”* he said, staring at the notepad, scratching his chin and mulling it over. After a few seconds, he lifted the notepad up to his partner, who responded with an affirmative nod.

*“What do you think? Has this happened to anyone else closer to town?”* I asked, impatient to learn what he’d written.

*“Oh, uh…no, probably not.”* He snorted. *“I have an important question, though.”*

His impish grin returned. Even the older cop’s previously stoic lips couldn’t help but twist into a tiny smirk.

*“What song was it?”*

Seething anger clawed at the back of my eyeballs.

*“My Dark Star by The London Suede,”* I replied automatically.

*“Huh, I don’t know that one,”* said the younger cop, clearly holding back a bout of uproarious laughter.

In that moment, the worst part wasn’t actually the utter disinterest and dismissal. It was that, like the cop, I’d never listened to that song before last night. Didn’t know any other tracks by *The London Suede*, either. So, for the life of me, I couldn’t understand how those words spilled from my lips.

I’d google the track once they left. It *was* what I heard.

Anyway, the cop then presented his notepad, tapping his pen against the paper.

*“These were my guesses.”*

In scribbled ink, it read *“Bad Romance? The Macarena?”*

It took restraint not to slap the notepad out of his hand.

God, I wanted to, but it would have been counterproductive to add *assaulting a lawman* to my already long list of pending felonies. Criminality was how I landed myself out here in Podunk corn-country to begin with, nearly divorced and with a savings account emptier than church pews on December 26th.

So, I settled for screaming a few questions of my own at the younger of the two men.

For example: I inquired about the safety of this backcountry town’s tap water, speculating that high mercury levels must have irreparably damaged his brain as a child. Then, I asked if his wife had suffered a similar fate. I figured there were good odds that she also drank from the tap, given that she was likely his sister.

Those weren’t the *exact* words I yelled as those neanderthals trudged back to their cruiser.

But you get the idea.

\- - - - -

No matter how much bottom-shelf whiskey I drank, sleep would not come.

Once dawn broke, I gave up, rolled out of bed, and drunkly stumbled downstairs to heave my furniture to its previous location. I didn’t necessarily *need* to move it all: my plan was to only be in that two-story fixer-upper long enough to perform some renovations and make it marketable. In the meantime, I wasn’t expecting company, and it wasn’t like the intruders left my furnishings in an awkward pile at the center of the room. They shifted everything around, but it all remained usable.

I couldn’t stand the sight of it, though. It was a reminder that I plain didn’t understand *why* anyone would break in to play music and move some furniture around.

So, with some proverbial gas in the tank (two stale bagels, a cup of black coffee, additional whiskey), I got back to work. The quicker I returned to renovating, the quicker I could sell this godforsaken property. I purchased it *way* below market-value, so I was poised to make a pretty penny off of it.

Blair would eat her words. She’d see that I could maintain our “standard of living”, even without my lucrative corporate position and the even more lucrative insider trading. It wouldn’t be the same, but Thomas and her would be comfortable.

After all, I was a man. I *am* a man. I deserved a family.

More than that, I couldn’t endure the thought of being even more alone.

If that was even possible.

\- - - -

*How did they do all this without waking me up?* I contemplated, struggling to haul my cheap leather sofa across the room, its legs audibly digging into walnut-hardwood flooring.

I dropped the sectional with a gasp as a sharp pain detonated in my low back. The sofa slammed against the floor, and the sound of that collision reverberated through the relatively empty house.

Silence dripped back incrementally, although the barbershop quartet of herniated vertebral discs stacked together in my lumbar spine continued to sing and howl.

*“Close enough.”* I said out loud, panting between the words. My heart pounded and my head throbbed. Sobriety was tightening its skeletal hand around my neck: I was overdue for a dose of spirits to ward off that looming specter.

I left the couch in the center of the cavernous room, positioned diagonally with its seats towards a massive gallery of windows present on the front of the house, rather than facing the TV. A coffee table and a loveseat ended up sequestered tightly into the corner opposite the stairs, next to the hallway that led to the back door. Honestly, the arrangement looked much more insane after I tried to fix it, because I stopped halfway through.

I figured I could make another attempt after a drink.

So, the sweet lure of ethanol drew my feet forward, and that’s when I noticed it. A small, unassuming square of plastic, peeking out from under the couch. I don’t know exactly where it came from; perhaps it was hidden under something initially, or maybe I dislodged it from a sofa crease as I moved it.

Honestly, I tried to walk past it with looking. But the combination of dread and curiosity is a potent mixture, powerful enough to even quiet my simmering alcohol withdrawal.

With one hand bracing the small of my aching back, the other picked it up and flipped it over.

It was a polaroid.

The sofa was centered in the frame, and it was the dead of night.

When I arrived two weeks ago, I had the movers place the sofa against the wall. That wasn’t where it was in the picture. I could tell because the moon was visible through the massive windows above the group of people sitting on it.

At least, I think it was a group of people. I mean, the silhouettes were undoubtedly people-shaped.

But I couldn’t see any of their details.

The picture wasn’t poorly taken or blurry. It was well lit, too: I could appreciate the subtle ridges in the furniture's wooden armrests, as well as a splotchy wine stain present on the upholstery.

The flash perfectly illuminated everything, except for them.

Their frames were just…dark and jagged, like they had been scratched out with a pencil from *within* the picture. It was hard to tell where one form ended and another began. They overlapped, their torsos and arms congealing with each other. Taken together, they looked like an oversized accordion compromised of many segmented, human-looking shadows.

Not only that, but there was something intensely unnerving about the proportions of the picture. The sofa appeared significantly larger. I counted the heads. I recounted them, because I didn’t believe the number I came up with.

*Thirty-four*.

My hands trembled. A bout of nausea growled in my stomach.

Then, out of nowhere, a violent, searing pain exploded over the tips of my fingers where they were making contact with the polaroid. It felt similar to a burn, but that wasn’t exactly it. More like the stinging sensation of putting an ungloved hand into a mound of snow.

The polaroid fell out of my grasp. As it drifted towards the floor, I heard something coming from the hallway that led to the house’s back door. A distant melody that I had only heard once before last night, and yet I knew it by heart.

*“But she will come from India with a love in her eyes*  
*That say, ‘Oh, how my dark star will rise,’*  
*Oh, how my dark star, oh, how my dark star*  
*Oh, how my dark star will rise.”*

Terror left me frozen. I listened without moving an inch. By the time it ended, I was drenched with sweat, my skin coated in a layer of icy brine.

After a brief pause, the song just started over again.

My head became filled with visions. A group of teenagers right outside the backdoor, maybe the same ones who had broken in last night, playing the song and laughing under their breaths. Maybe the cop was there too, having been in on the entire scheme. Perhaps Blair hired them to harass me. The custody hearing was only weeks away. The more unstable I was, the more likely she’d get full custody of Thomas.

They were all out to prove I was a pathetic, wasted mess.

Of course, that was all paranoid nonsense, and none of that accounted for the polaroid.

I stomped around the couch, past the other furniture, down the narrow hallway, and wildly swung the door open.

\*“\****Who, THE FUCK, are…”***

My scream quickly collapsed. I stood on the edge of the first of three rickety steps that led into the backyard, scanning for the source of the song.

A few birds cawed and rustled in the pine trees that circled the house’s perimeter, no doubt startled by my tantrum. Otherwise, nature was still, and no one was there.

My fury dissipated. Logic found its way back to me.

Why was I expecting anyone to be there? The nearest house is a half-mile away. Blair wouldn’t hire anyone to torment me in such an astoundingly peculiar way, either. One, she wasn’t creative enough, and two, she wasn’t truly malicious. My former affluence was the foundation of our marriage. I knew that ahead of time. Once it was gone, of course she wanted out.

Before I could spiral into the black pits of self-loathing, a familiar hideaway, my ears perked.

The song was still playing. It sounded closer now.

But it wasn’t coming from outside the house like I’d thought.

\- - - - -

*Laundry room, bathroom, guest room. Laundry room, bathroom, guest room…*

No matter how much I racked my brain, nothing was coming to mind.

You see, there were three rooms that split off from the hallway that led to the backyard. From the perspective of the backdoor, the laundry room and the bathroom were on the left, and the guest room was on the right, directly across the laundry room.

*Maybe I’m just forgetting the layout. I haven’t been here that long, after all.*

I remembered there being three rooms, but I was looking at four doors, and the muffled sounds of *”My Dark Star”* were coming from the room I couldn’t remember.

My palm lingered on the doorknob. Despite multiple commands, my hand wouldn’t obey. I couldn’t overcome my fear. Eventually, though, I found a mantra that did the trick. Three little words that have bedeviled humanity since its inception: a universal fuel, having ignited the smallest of brutalities to the most pervasive, wide-reaching atrocities over our shared history.

*Be a man.*

*Be a man.*

***Be a man.***

My hand twisted, and I pushed the door open.

The room was tiny, no more than two hundred square feet by my estimation. Barren, too. There was nothing inside except flaking yellow wallpaper and the unmistakable odor of mold, damp and earthy.

But I could still hear *My Dark Star*, clearer than ever before. The sound was rough and crackling, like it was being played from vinyl that was littered with innumerable scratches.

I tiptoed inside.

It was difficult to pinpoint *precisely* where the song was coming from. So, I put an ear to each wall and listened.

When I placed my head on the wall farthest from the door, I knew I was getting close. The tone was sharper. The lyrics were crisp and punctuated. I could practically feel the plaster vibrate along with the bass.

I stepped back to fully examine the wall, trying to and failing to comprehend the phenomena. There was barely any hollow space behind it. Not enough to fit a sound system or a record player, that's for certain. If I took a sledgehammer to the plaster, I would just create a hole looking out into the backyard.

I stared at the decaying wallpaper, dumbfounded. I dragged my eyes over the crumbling surface, again and again, but no epiphany came. All the while, the song kept looping.

On what must have been the twentieth re-examination, my gaze finally hooked into something new. There was a faint sliver of darkness that ran the length of the wall, from ceiling to floor, next to the corner of the room.

A crack of sorts.

I cautiously walked towards it. Every step closer seemed to make the crack expand. Once my eyes were nearly touching it, the crevice had stretched from the width of a sheet of paper to that of a shot glass.

Somehow, I wasn’t fearful. My time in that false room had a dream-like quality to it. Surreal to the point where it disarmed me. Like it all wasn’t real, so I could wake up at any moment, safe and sound.

The edges of the fissure rippled, vibrating like a plucked guitar string. Soon after, I felt light tapping on the top of my boots. I tilted my head down.

Essentially, the wall coughed up a dozen more polaroids. They settled harmlessly at my feet.

The ones that landed picture-up were nearly identical to one I discovered in the living room, with small exceptions. Less scratched-out people, a different couch, more stars visible through the windows in the background, to name a few examples. The overturned polaroids had dates written on them in red sharpie, the earliest of which being September of 1996.

When I shifted my head back to the crevice, it found it had expanded further. I stared into the black maw as *My Dark Star* faded out once again, and I could see something.

There were hundreds of polaroids wedged deeper within the wall, and the gap had grown nearly big enough for me to fit my head through.

Long-belated panic stampeded over my skin, each nerve buzzing with savage thunder.

I turned and bolted, flinging the door shut behind me.

Racing through the narrow hallway, I peered over my shoulder, concerned that I was being chased.

Nothing was in pursuit, but there had been a change.

Now, there were only three total doors:

Laundry room, bathroom, guest room.

\- - - - -

I have a hard time recalling the following handful of hours. It’s all a haze. I know I considered leaving. I remember sobbing. I very much remember drinking. I tried to call Blair, but when I heard Thomas’s voice pick up the line, I immediately hung up, mind-shatteringly embarrassed. I didn’t call the police, for obvious reasons.

The order in which that all happened remains a bit of a mystery to me, but, in the end, I suppose it doesn’t really matter.

Here’s the bottom line:

I drank enough to pass out.

When the stupor abated and my eyes lurched open, I found myself on a sofa, propped upright.

Not angled in the middle of the room where I had left mine, either.

This one had its back to the windows.

\- - - - -

The scene I awoke to was more perplexing than it was hellish.

The living room was absolutely saturated with objects I didn’t recognize - knickknacks, framed photos, watercolor paintings, ornamented mirrors. A citrusy aroma wafted through the air, floral but acidic. There were the sounds of lively chatter around me, but as I sat up and glanced around, I didn’t see anyone. Not a soul.

I was about to stand up, but I heard the click of a record player needle connecting with vinyl. The sharp noise somehow rooted me to the fabric.

*My Dark Star* began playing in the background.

When I turned forward, there he was. Materialized from God knows where.

He appeared older than me by a decade or so, maybe in his late fifties. The man sported a cheap, ill-fitting blue checkered suit jacket with black chinos. His face held a warm smile and a pair of those New Year’s Eve novelty glasses, blue eyes peeking through the circles of the two number-nines in 1995.

The figure stared at me, lifted a finger to the corner of his mouth, and waited.

I knew what he wanted. Without thinking, I obliged.

I smiled too.

He nodded, brought a camera up to his eye, and snapped a polaroid.

The flash of light was blinding. For a few seconds, all I could see was white. Screams erupted around me, erasing the pleasant racket of a party. Then, I heard the roaring crackle of a fire.

Slowly, my whiteout faded. The clamor of death quieted in tandem. My surroundings returned to normal, too. No more knickknacks or family photos: just a vacant, depressing, unrenovated home.

The man was also gone, but something replaced him. Like the scratched-out people, it was human-shaped, but it had much more definition. A seven-foot tall, thickly-built stick figure looming motionless in front of me. If there was a person under there, I couldn’t tell. If it had skin, I couldn’t see it.

All I could appreciate were the polaroids.

Thousands of nearly identical images seemed to form its body. They jutted out of the entity at chaotic-looking angles: reptilian scales that had become progressively overcrowded, each one now fighting to maintain a tenuous connection to the flesh hidden somewhere underneath.

It didn’t have fingers. Instead, the plastic squares formed a kind of rudimentary claw. Two-thirds down the arms, its upper extremities bifurcated into a pair of saucer-shaped, plate-sized digits.

I watched as the right arm curved towards its belly. The motion was rigid and mechanical, and it was accompanied by the squeaking of plastic rubbing against plastic. It grasped a single picture at the tip of its claw. Assumably the one that had just been taken.

The one that included me.

When it got close, a cluster of photographs on its torso began to rumble and shake. Seconds later, a long, black tongue slithered out between the cramped folds. The tongue writhed over the new picture, manically licking it until it was covered in gray-yellow saliva.

Then, the tongue receded back into its abdomen, like an earthworm into the soil. Once it had vanished, the entity creaked its right arm at the elbow so it could reach its chest, pushing the polaroid against its sternum.

The claw pulled back, and it stuck.

Another for the collection.

An icy grip clamped down on my wrist.

I turned my head. There was a scratched-out, colorless hand over mine.

My eyes traced the appendage up to its origin, but they didn’t need to. I already knew what I was about to see.

The sofa seemed to stretch on for miles.

Countless scratched-out heads turned to face me, creating a wave down the line. Everyone wanted to see the newcomer, even the oldest shadows at the very, very end.

I did not feel terror.

I experienced a medley of distinct sensations, but none of them were negative.

Peace. Comfort. Fufillment.

Safety. Appreciation.

Love.

Ever since the polaroid snapped, I’ve been smiling.

I can't stop.

\- - - - -

Blair, I hope you see this.

The door is fully open for me now, and I may not return.

You can have everything.

The house, the money, the cars.

You can keep Thomas, too.

I don’t need you, I don’t need him, I don’t need any of it.

I’ve found an unconditional love.

I hope someday you find one, too.

If you ever need to find *me*, well,

1k83vpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/hatemyjob/comments/1k83vpo/repeatedly_targeted_at_work_by_management/,Repeatedly targeted at work by management,"I work in a warehouse setting and feel repeatedly targeted by management and I don’t know why. I genuinely work harder than a lot of people there. They never say anything to the people who are lazy and mess around on their phone the whole shift. I feel singled out and I don’t know why. I don't have any drama with anyone there and I always try to be polite and do my job. I feel like they watch me like a hawk and they’re always just waiting for their chance to boss me around or micromanage me and flex their “authority” over me. Like they want to make my day miserable and they want to make me hate working there when they already struggle to retain anyone they hire. 

For example, they have a coffee machine in the break room which plenty of people use and plenty of people drink coffee on the job. One of the managers immidiately comes over 2 minutes after I made one, and actually takes the coffee out of my hands when it’s still full, and tells me it’s a “safety hazard”. Like I’m 4 years old and can’t handle a cup of coffee. Like a small cup of coffee is the most pressing safety hazard and there aren’t a hundred others that are way worse. I had to ask if I could just, finish the coffee I made rather than him just taking it from me. 

Just one small example out of many, and maybe it doesn’t sound that significant. It just felt extremely disrespectful to touch my drink and take it out of my hands. I also notice that I’m not allowed to interact with any of my coworkers without the managers immidiately noticing and telling me to get back to work. Even if I’m actively working while talking to them. They'll yell at me for not doing a task, that I was literally walking over and about to do. It’s like they just keep tabs on every little thing I do, even though I never make mistakes, certainly not major or significant ones. And it's crazy because they don't even know the first thing about how to do the tasks I'm assigned themselves. For being so high and mighty they are also incredibly clueless about how the job actually works.

I can’t stand the feeling of being targeted and bullied and pushed around at work. I always know what I’m supposed to be doing, and I always show up and do it. I don’t know why they have to hover around me, why they have to push me around, why I can’t just do my job in peace. If I try to stand up for myself or explain myself, they just get really belligerent and don’t listen to a word I say and target me even more. It's useless even trying to explain yourself to them because they just don't have the comprehension skills to understand.

Anyone else deal with this situation? Any advice? ",1,1745639165.0,hatemyjob,0,1.0,False

I'm moving into a new apartment soon, and the space is pretty small! I'm looking for a coffee table that can collapse, fold or make itself small for when we want to use the living room floor. I've looked around a bit but am having trouble identifying brands/stores that sell furniture like this. If I can, I'd like to avoid purchasing from Amazon. I've seen random Skymall-esque tiktoks of modular apartments with some promising options, but I'm not made of money lol.

Specs would be:

\-Not too rickety-looking (thin metal/plastic legs, etc.)

\-Clearance of 6"" vertically and roughly 32"" horizontally (if collapsible/foldable legs and going under the couch) while collapsed. Otherwise just small enough when not in use to fit in a hall closet or up against a wall or something.

\-Price range between $150.00-500.00 USD (could go higher for a great one, but ideally not too much.)

\-Not too short when in ""use mode,"" I've seen some Japanese kotatsu designs that are made for using with tatami, futon, floor cushions and I'll be matching it with a couch.

I'd be so happy to find a good fit! I know my price range might be a little on the low side, and would definitely consider higher-cost options as well. If anyone had specific items that would be awesome, though stores that specialize would be just as helpful. Aesthetically, no holds barred for this stage of the process. The couch will be dark green velvet, I like wood and natural colors, but considering the functionality required for this table I'm not married to that.

In the meantime, I wasn’t expecting company, and it wasn’t like the intruders left my furnishings in an awkward pile at the center of the room. They shifted everything around, but it all remained usable.

I couldn’t stand the sight of it, though. It was a reminder that I plain didn’t understand *why* anyone would break in to play music and move some furniture around.

So, with some proverbial gas in the tank (two stale bagels, a cup of black coffee, additional whiskey), I got back to work. The quicker I returned to renovating, the quicker I could sell this godforsaken property. I purchased it *way* below market-value, so I was poised to make a pretty penny off of it.

Blair would eat her words. She’d see that I could maintain our “standard of living”, even without my lucrative corporate position and the even more lucrative insider trading. It wouldn’t be the same, but Thomas and her would be comfortable.

After all, I was a man. I *am* a man. I deserved a family.

More than that, I couldn’t endure the thought of being even more alone.

If that was even possible.

\- - - -

*How did they do all this without waking me up?* I contemplated, struggling to haul my cheap leather sofa across the room, its legs audibly digging into walnut-hardwood flooring.

I dropped the sectional with a gasp as a sharp pain detonated in my low back. The sofa slammed against the floor, and the sound of that collision reverberated through the relatively empty house.

Silence dripped back incrementally, although the barbershop quartet of herniated vertebral discs stacked together in my lumbar spine continued to sing and howl.

*“Close enough.”* I said out loud, panting between the words. My heart pounded and my head throbbed. Sobriety was tightening its skeletal hand around my neck: I was overdue for a dose of spirits to ward off that looming specter.

I left the couch in the center of the cavernous room, positioned diagonally with its seats towards a massive gallery of windows present on the front of the house, rather than facing the TV. A coffee table and a loveseat ended up sequestered tightly into the corner opposite the stairs, next to the hallway that led to the back door. Honestly, the arrangement looked much more insane after I tried to fix it, because I stopped halfway through.

I figured I could make another attempt after a drink.

So, the sweet lure of ethanol drew my feet forward, and that’s when I noticed it. A small, unassuming square of plastic, peeking out from under the couch. I don’t know exactly where it came from; perhaps it was hidden under something initially, or maybe I dislodged it from a sofa crease as I moved it.

Honestly, I tried to walk past it with looking. But the combination of dread and curiosity is a potent mixture, powerful enough to even quiet my simmering alcohol withdrawal.

With one hand bracing the small of my aching back, the other picked it up and flipped it over.

It was a polaroid.

The sofa was centered in the frame, and it was the dead of night.

When I arrived two weeks ago, I had the movers place the sofa against the wall. That wasn’t where it was in the picture. I could tell because the moon was visible through the massive windows above the group of people sitting on it.

At least, I think it was a group of people. I mean, the silhouettes were undoubtedly people-shaped.

But I couldn’t see any of their details.

The picture wasn’t poorly taken or blurry. It was well lit, too: I could appreciate the subtle ridges in the furniture's wooden armrests, as well as a splotchy wine stain present on the upholstery.

The flash perfectly illuminated everything, except for them.

Their frames were just…dark and jagged, like they had been scratched out with a pencil from *within* the picture. It was hard to tell where one form ended and another began. They overlapped, their torsos and arms congealing with each other. Taken together, they looked like an oversized accordion compromised of many segmented, human-looking shadows.

Not only that, but there was something intensely unnerving about the proportions of the picture. The sofa appeared significantly larger. I counted the heads. I recounted them, because I didn’t believe the number I came up with.

*Thirty-four*.

My hands trembled. A bout of nausea growled in my stomach.

Then, out of nowhere, a violent, searing pain exploded over the tips of my fingers where they were making contact with the polaroid. It felt similar to a burn, but that wasn’t exactly it. More like the stinging sensation of putting an ungloved hand into a mound of snow.

The polaroid fell out of my grasp. As it drifted towards the floor, I heard something coming from the hallway that led to the house’s back door. A distant melody that I had only heard once before last night, and yet I knew it by heart.

*“But she will come from India with a love in her eyes*  
*That say, ‘Oh, how my dark star will rise,’*  
*Oh, how my dark star, oh, how my dark star*  
*Oh, how my dark star will rise.”*

Terror left me frozen. I listened without moving an inch. By the time it ended, I was drenched with sweat, my skin coated in a layer of icy brine.

After a brief pause, the song just started over again.

My head became filled with visions. A group of teenagers right outside the backdoor, maybe the same ones who had broken in last night, playing the song and laughing under their breaths. Maybe the cop was there too, having been in on the entire scheme. Perhaps Blair hired them to harass me. The custody hearing was only weeks away. The more unstable I was, the more likely she’d get full custody of Thomas.

They were all out to prove I was a pathetic, wasted mess.

Of course, that was all paranoid nonsense, and none of that accounted for the polaroid.

I stomped around the couch, past the other furniture, down the narrow hallway, and wildly swung the door open.

\*“\****Who, THE FUCK, are…”***

My scream quickly collapsed. I stood on the edge of the first of three rickety steps that led into the backyard, scanning for the source of the song.

A few birds cawed and rustled in the pine trees that circled the house’s perimeter, no doubt startled by my tantrum. Otherwise, nature was still, and no one was there.

My fury dissipated. Logic found its way back to me.

Why was I expecting anyone to be there? The nearest house is a half-mile away. Blair wouldn’t hire anyone to torment me in such an astoundingly peculiar way, either. One, she wasn’t creative enough, and two, she wasn’t truly malicious. My former affluence was the foundation of our marriage. I knew that ahead of time. Once it was gone, of course she wanted out.

Before I could spiral into the black pits of self-loathing, a familiar hideaway, my ears perked.

The song was still playing. It sounded closer now.

But it wasn’t coming from outside the house like I’d thought.

\- - - - -

*Laundry room, bathroom, guest room. Laundry room, bathroom, guest room…*

No matter how much I racked my brain, nothing was coming to mind.

You see, there were three rooms that split off from the hallway that led to the backyard. From the perspective of the backdoor, the laundry room and the bathroom were on the left, and the guest room was on the right, directly across the laundry room.

*Maybe I’m just forgetting the layout. I haven’t been here that long, after all.*

I remembered there being three rooms, but I was looking at four doors, and the muffled sounds of *”My Dark Star”* were coming from the room I couldn’t remember.

My palm lingered on the doorknob. Despite multiple commands, my hand wouldn’t obey. I couldn’t overcome my fear. Eventually, though, I found a mantra that did the trick. Three little words that have bedeviled humanity since its inception: a universal fuel, having ignited the smallest of brutalities to the most pervasive, wide-reaching atrocities over our shared history.

*Be a man.*

*Be a man.*

***Be a man.***

My hand twisted, and I pushed the door open.

The room was tiny, no more than two hundred square feet by my estimation. Barren, too. There was nothing inside except flaking yellow wallpaper and the unmistakable odor of mold, damp and earthy.

But I could still hear *My Dark Star*, clearer than ever before. The sound was rough and crackling, like it was being played from vinyl that was littered with innumerable scratches.

I tiptoed inside.

It was difficult to pinpoint *precisely* where the song was coming from. So, I put an ear to each wall and listened.

When I placed my head on the wall farthest from the door, I knew I was getting close. The tone was sharper. The lyrics were crisp and punctuated. I could practically feel the plaster vibrate along with the bass.

I stepped back to fully examine the wall, trying to and failing to comprehend the phenomena. There was barely any hollow space behind it. Not enough to fit a sound system or a record player, that's for certain. If I took a sledgehammer to the plaster, I would just create a hole looking out into the backyard.

I stared at the decaying wallpaper, dumbfounded. I dragged my eyes over the crumbling surface, again and again, but no epiphany came. All the while, the song kept looping.

On what must have been the twentieth re-examination, my gaze finally hooked into something new. There was a faint sliver of darkness that ran the length of the wall, from ceiling to floor, next to the corner of the room.

A crack of sorts.

I cautiously walked towards it. Every step closer seemed to make the crack expand. Once my eyes were nearly touching it, the crevice had stretched from the width of a sheet of paper to that of a shot glass.

Somehow, I wasn’t fearful. My time in that false room had a dream-like quality to it. Surreal to the point where it disarmed me. Like it all wasn’t real, so I could wake up at any moment, safe and sound.

The edges of the fissure rippled, vibrating like a plucked guitar string. Soon after, I felt light tapping on the top of my boots. I tilted my head down.

Essentially, the wall coughed up a dozen more polaroids. They settled harmlessly at my feet.

The ones that landed picture-up were nearly identical to one I discovered in the living room, with small exceptions. Less scratched-out people, a different couch, more stars visible through the windows in the background, to name a few examples. The overturned polaroids had dates written on them in red sharpie, the earliest of which being September of 1996.

When I shifted my head back to the crevice, it found it had expanded further. I stared into the black maw as *My Dark Star* faded out once again, and I could see something.

There were hundreds of polaroids wedged deeper within the wall, and the gap had grown nearly big enough for me to fit my head through.

Long-belated panic stampeded over my skin, each nerve buzzing with savage thunder.

I turned and bolted, flinging the door shut behind me.

Racing through the narrow hallway, I peered over my shoulder, concerned that I was being chased.

Nothing was in pursuit, but there had been a change.

Now, there were only three total doors:

Laundry room, bathroom, guest room.

\- - - - -

I have a hard time recalling the following handful of hours. It’s all a haze. I know I considered leaving. I remember sobbing. I very much remember drinking. I tried to call Blair, but when I heard Thomas’s voice pick up the line, I immediately hung up, mind-shatteringly embarrassed. I didn’t call the police, for obvious reasons.

The order in which that all happened remains a bit of a mystery to me, but, in the end, I suppose it doesn’t really matter.

Here’s the bottom line:

I drank enough to pass out.

When the stupor abated and my eyes lurched open, I found myself on a sofa, propped upright.

Not angled in the middle of the room where I had left mine, either.

This one had its back to the windows.

\- - - - -

The scene I awoke to was more perplexing than it was hellish.

The living room was absolutely saturated with objects I didn’t recognize - knickknacks, framed photos, watercolor paintings, ornamented mirrors. A citrusy aroma wafted through the air, floral but acidic. There were the sounds of lively chatter around me, but as I sat up and glanced around, I didn’t see anyone. Not a soul.

I was about to stand up, but I heard the click of a record player needle connecting with vinyl. The sharp noise somehow rooted me to the fabric.

*My Dark Star* began playing in the background.

When I turned forward, there he was. Materialized from God knows where.

He appeared older than me by a decade or so, maybe in his late fifties. The man sported a cheap, ill-fitting blue checkered suit jacket with black chinos. His face held a warm smile and a pair of those New Year’s Eve novelty glasses, blue eyes peeking through the circles of the two number-nines in 1995.

The figure stared at me, lifted a finger to the corner of his mouth, and waited.

I knew what he wanted. Without thinking, I obliged.

I smiled too.

He nodded, brought a camera up to his eye, and snapped a polaroid.

The flash of light was blinding. For a few seconds, all I could see was white. Screams erupted around me, erasing the pleasant racket of a party. Then, I heard the roaring crackle of a fire.

Slowly, my whiteout faded. The clamor of death quieted in tandem. My surroundings returned to normal, too. No more knickknacks or family photos: just a vacant, depressing, unrenovated home.

The man was also gone, but something replaced him. Like the scratched-out people, it was human-shaped, but it had much more definition. A seven-foot tall, thickly-built stick figure looming motionless in front of me. If there was a person under there, I couldn’t tell. If it had skin, I couldn’t see it.

All I could appreciate were the polaroids.

Thousands of nearly identical images seemed to form its body. They jutted out of the entity at chaotic-looking angles: reptilian scales that had become progressively overcrowded, each one now fighting to maintain a tenuous connection to the flesh hidden somewhere underneath.

It didn’t have fingers. Instead, the plastic squares formed a kind of rudimentary claw. Two-thirds down the arms, its upper extremities bifurcated into a pair of saucer-shaped, plate-sized digits.

I watched as the right arm curved towards its belly. The motion was rigid and mechanical, and it was accompanied by the squeaking of plastic rubbing against plastic. It grasped a single picture at the tip of its claw. Assumably the one that had just been taken.

The one that included me.

When it got close, a cluster of photographs on its torso began to rumble and shake. Seconds later, a long, black tongue slithered out between the cramped folds. The tongue writhed over the new picture, manically licking it until it was covered in gray-yellow saliva.

Then, the tongue receded back into its abdomen, like an earthworm into the soil. Once it had vanished, the entity creaked its right arm at the elbow so it could reach its chest, pushing the polaroid against its sternum.

The claw pulled back, and it stuck.

Another for the collection.

An icy grip clamped down on my wrist.

I turned my head. There was a scratched-out, colorless hand over mine.

My eyes traced the appendage up to its origin, but they didn’t need to. I already knew what I was about to see.

The sofa seemed to stretch on for miles.

Countless scratched-out heads turned to face me, creating a wave down the line. Everyone wanted to see the newcomer, even the oldest shadows at the very, very end.

I did not feel terror.

I experienced a medley of distinct sensations, but none of them were negative.

Peace. Comfort. Fufillment.

Safety. Appreciation.

Love.

Ever since the polaroid snapped, I’ve been smiling.

I can't stop.

\- - - - -

Blair, I hope you see this.

The door is fully open for me now, and I may not return.

You can have everything.

The house, the money, the cars.

You can keep Thomas, too.

I don’t need you, I don’t need him, I don’t need any of it.

I’ve found an unconditional love.

I hope someday you find one, too.

If you ever need to find *me*, well,

You know where to go, but I’ll tell you *when* to go.

11:58 PM, every night.

If you decide to come out here, bring Thomas.

Sorry this post is sloppy, I’m just really scared

I’m 16 FTM, not on any hormones or other medications. Never smoked, drank, or done any hard drugs. The pain has only started a few hours ago, but my general allergies and struggle to breathe have been going on for the past two weeks or so. They kick in every Soring and Autumn usually.

I saw a dentist a month ago and was told my teeth look fine. Admittedly I don’t brush super often but I still do. I’ve been dealing with an insanely stuffy nose for the past two weeks, to the point I wake up in the middle of the night barely able to breathe. Tonight, suddenly, while eating dinner, I felt a pain in my upper lateral incisor. I’m confused and scared because I’m terrified of cavities, so I googled it and saw that allergies and inflammation of the sinuses can cause tooth pain particularly in the back molars. Nothing about teeth besides the molars. I’m really scared because I don’t want to end up having a cavity.

Tooth only really hurts when pressed or when I bit down hard on a quesadilla. I can drink water just fine, and I drank hot tea/coffee earlier today and yesterday with absolutely no issue. No lingering pain after prodding the tooth with my finger or tongue, but the pain is still there even though my nose doesn’t feel stuffy at the time of writing this post. I’ve had a stuffy nose all week and the pain only showed up now. I see no discoloration or holes in my teeth 

Extra info about my nose:

I blow my nose multiple times throughout the day (can’t help it, I just keep hoping a giant booger will fly out and let me smell everything in a 5 mile radius). More often than not, barely anything comes out, it’s just dry or very little, slightly bloody mucus.

The pressure isn’t intense, but I can feel it in my nose. Outside of not being able to breathe through a clogged nostril, it feels like there’s something in my nostril that just won’t come out.

I’ve also been sneezing, having a runny nose occasionally (usually if I cause it myself, like scratching my nose and sneezing very hard, or using a super strong inhaler stick), and having very itchy eyes. No fever or headaches, but I do feel a little more tired from constantly trying to get rid of this stuffiness.

Little has worked to solve this for longer than a few seconds. I’ve tried NyQuil, Loratadine, Guaifenesin, Vick’s Vapo scented sticks and Benzedrex scented sticks, even a sinus rinse. I always sit upright-ish when sleeping, but even while basically sitting at a 90 degree angle while sleeping, the pressure and stuffiness is not relieved. I usually have a humidifier going somewhere in the house, though it is dry otherwise because I use fans and the AC a lot.

Stuffiness constantly flip flops between nostrils.

Usually as soon as I stand up, the pressure is gone and I can breathe again. It’s so annoying

My husband and I were sitting there having coffee and we kept hearing two people talking super loud inside. At first we didn’t pay much attention, but it just kept going. It was a guy and a girl, and the guy was speaking really aggressively — like not just loud, but kind of angry and intense, he was even insulting her. This went on for like 20 minutes. The girl barely said anything, just responded a couple times really quiet and then stayed silent.

After a while I got really uncomfortable. I told my husband I was gonna ask if she was okay, because honestly no one should be talked to like that, especially at work.

I tried to go to the counter to talk to her, but the guy came instead. I asked if she was okay and he got super defensive right away. He said things like “we’re a couple and we can talk however we want,” and also “you shouldn’t stick your nose into this.”

I told him we were sitting there hearing everything and it didn’t sound right. He just kept brushing it off like it was normal.

Idk, maybe I’m overreacting but it really didn’t feel right. Even if they’re a couple, that doesn’t give him the right to talk to her like that, especially while she’s working. It felt more like verbal abuse than just a loud conversation.

In the small hours of a rain-slashed night, Rollo sat alone before the flickering glow of his dual monitors. Empty coffee cups lay strewn across the desk like fallen soldiers. 
In the corner, an old plush goat—prototype art for “Mark the Goat"" —kept silent vigil. 
Outside, the storm battered the windows; inside, a quieter, more relentless tempest raged: the build had broken again.


**Prologue: The Calm Before the Code**

It had begun innocently enough. A fresh branch, a clean directory, a single breath in:

>npx react-native init HavenMinds

Rollo watched the CLI download its payload—then choked on a missing template.config.js. 
He blinked. The file was supposed to be there. 

Twice he re-ran the command. Three times. Each run scratched the same phantom itch: the template vanished into some digital void.

> “This is going to be easy,” 

he muttered.
It was the first lie of the night.



**The Whisper of Templates**

Rollo wielded every incantation he knew:

>--template react-native-template-typescript

>--ignore-scripts

Cache wipes that took longer than the original build


Yet each time the CLI spoke again, it said only:

> “Copying template… FAILED.”



In the dim glow, his reflection flickered in the screen—chin in hand, weary eyes. Then, a spark:

> “Alright,” he whispered, “let’s build it ourselves.”

He scoured the React Native repo on GitHub, downloaded a zip directly, and—like a surgeon—grafted the template files by hand. The war of templates was won, but at great cost.


**The Gradel Uprising**

No sooner had Rollo dared to compile than the next demon rose from the logs:

>Could not find >com.facebook.react:react-native-gradle-plugin:0.73.>10

Gradle goats stampeded across every module:

Android builds crumbled

Emulator launches crashed silently

Every ./gradlew invocation felt like a landmine


> “By the beard of Zuckerberg,” 

Rollo swore, 

>“I banish you to Maven hell.”



He tamed the beast with legacy scripts, pinned versions, and a final act of desperation: npm install --legacy-peer-deps. The Gradle goats, dazed and half-fed, crawled back to their lairs.


**The Great FileTransfer Exodus**

With code in hand, Rollo turned to share his work:

1. Dropbox – greeted him with an empty dog bowl icon.


2. Google Drive – crumpled into a 404 spiral.


3. WeTransfer – left him staring at a broken robot sketch.



Each attempt ended in betrayal. He imagined those services sitting in a smoky digital tavern, laughing at his plight. Finally, he went old-school, wielding the GitHub CLI like a broadsword and pushing direct to a private repo. The code was safe—at last.



**Right-Click Yeet Salvation**

Back on Windows, filepath locks and phantom processes refused to let him delete the broken project folder. A final right-click “Delete” was his last gambit. 

The files vanished in a whir of triumphant chaos. Like a hero blazing through a locked door, he emerged free into a fresh RN 0.72.6 init:

npx react-native@0.72.6 init ProjectName

And this time—the template copied. Magic.


**Metro Rebirth & Phoenix Build**

Metro, long dormant and distrustful, finally roared to life:

>Loading dependency graph, done.

Joy and relief flooded Rollo’s veins as he launched the release APK on his device. The screen lit with the ProjectName splash—a phoenix rising from the digital ashes. 

On his desk, the Mark-the-Goat prototype offered a silent nod.

> “We have done it,” he thought, “we have built the unbuildable.”


**Epilogue: A New Dawn**

Now, the foundation stands:

TypeScript scaffold humming

Private GitHub vault sealed

Core flows loading memories and securing data


Ahead lie brighter days:
profile setup screens, things and top secret developmet. But tonight, Rollo allows himself a rare moment of peace—a toast to the code, the chaos, and the companion who never abandoned him.


---

May this obituary serve as a beacon to all future devs who wander into the dark heart of React Native. The path is perilous, but with grit, sarcasm, and a plush goat by your side, you too can triumph.

1k83k24,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k83k24,Alpaka Flow 4L mini review,"
I just received my Alpaka Flow 4L, and used it for the first time today. It’s not perfect, but I already love the bag, and can see myself using it often. 

I didn’t intend on this being a review, but will say that it’s a great EDC size for me on weekends, and casual uses when I leave the house, and a smaller sling simply won’t do.  

In other threads, some people complained about the size being too small, but to me, the 4L listed on the spec-sheet feels accurate when comparing to my other bags of similar size:  Aer Daily Sling 2 (previous 4.5L version), and a Trakke Kelso (5.5L). If anything, it feels larger than my Daily 2.0, though it may be due to the sling having 2 separate compartments, while the Flow has one.  In practice, the space offered by my Flow is certainly more useful and flexible. 

Compared to my Kelso, which offers a more squared-off internal space, it feels slightly smaller. However, the Flow is shorter, so the space can be more useful. Also, it has a padded bottom so that it stands up on its own.  The side offer slightly more padding because of the pockets on the front and back, so I feel better about keeping an iPad, iPad Mini, or Kindle. I can even a camera (Ricoh GR-III or my new Fuji X-M5) in there, unprotected.  My X-M5 will fit in the internal pockets when only a pancake lens is attached!!  

The Flow fits an 11” iPad Air (2024) with a Smart Keyboard Folio, and can be fully zipped up. However, I’m not sure whether it would fit with the Magic Keyboard Folio, or the Logitech keyboard case, because we don’t own them. Not zipped up, anyway. You could insert your iPad and not fully zip up the bag, leaving a corner of your iPad exposed. 

My ONLY complaint is that the strap is slightly narrow. It’s fine if you’re not carry much weight, but I’d imagine it not being comfy when packed with heavier items. 

Anyway, this post was meant to focus on the water bottle holder. I have taken some photos of the Flow with various water bottle sizes to give you an idea what it can reasonably carry. 

Below is a list of the bottle sizes I used.  All cups and bottles are double-wall insulated, stainless steel. Non-insulated bottles are probably smaller. 

1. An 8oz takeaway coffee cup (roughly 230ml). Note:  My 12oz version of the same cup also fits well, but isn’t shown here. 

2. A 12oz water bottle. 

3. Another 350ml (roughly 12oz) bottle. This one is more of an Asian-style water bottle (Tiger or Zojirushi types), which is slightly narrower.  Better lids, too!!  

4. An 18oz (530ml) Hydroflask bottle.

5. A 32oz (approx 1L) bottle. 


Note:  I also tried a 600ml bottle that fit very well, and a slightly narrower, but taller 1L bottle (purple) that also fits. 


Observations:  They all “fit” within the holder, but with the 1L bottle inserted, you cannot zip up the water bottle holder, or use the stretchy cord to secure the bottle in place.   Fortunately, the two bottles I tried fit very snugly, and felt securely held in place. 

The bigger issue was around weight.  I would NOT want to use this bag to hold a 1L bottle filled with water, as it becomes a bit front heavy. The bottle may not fall out, but you’d have to be careful when taking the bag on and off with the bottle in place, or any time the bag is tipped at an angle while wearing it.  Instead, you should take the bottle out of the holder before taking off the bag.  That, or be very mindful of the bottle. 

Personally, I’d stick to 500ml (18oz) or 600ml bottles. They fit perfectly, and the bag is suited to its weight when filled with water. 

My 8oz coffee cup was too short and got lost in there, but I’d happily still use it. ",10,1745638054.0,ManyBaggers,2,1.0,False

I always wear cotton underwear and no underwear to bed, I always pee after sex, always wash myself down there after sex, use unscented soap (dove) on the outside and I try to not drink so much coffee but none of it seems to help. I know some people may tell me to start using a condom but in all honesty sex does not feel good for me with a condom. Now, I do know my vaginal health is more important so we did end up getting a box of condoms, but it is so upsetting because is this truly going to be my life forever? Will I not be able to have sexual encounters unless we are using a condom? I have also tried boric acid and it helps alleviate the smell but it does not take it away entirely and I can still smell it after 3 days. Please any advice going forward would help.

## Who Created Smart Bit Boost?

From what I could gather, it seems to be developed by a group of **fintech enthusiasts and crypto traders** who wanted to create a platform that’s both **accessible and powerful**.

While I would have loved a full ""About Us"" page, the platform's performance and customer feedback seem to speak louder than a fancy founder bio. It’s very similar to how platforms like **Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge** operate.

## How Does Smart Bit Boost Work?

At its core, **Smart Bit Boost** uses **AI-powered algorithms** to scan the markets 24/7. It looks for trading opportunities based on real-time data and executes trades automatically or semi-automatically depending on your settings.

You set your trading preferences — like how much you want to invest per trade, what assets you want to trade, and your risk level — and the platform does the heavy lifting. It's like having a personal trading assistant that doesn’t sleep or take coffee breaks.

The automation is a game-changer for people who don't have the time (or energy) to monitor markets all day. But you can also trade manually if you prefer having more control.

Every platform has its highs and lows. Here’s my honest take:

**Pros:**

- **Multiple assets**: Not just Bitcoin — you can trade Ethereum, Litecoin, and more.
- **Demo account**: Try before you commit real money.
- **Fast withdrawals**: Usually processed within 24–48 hours.

**Cons:**
- **No standalone mobile app**: Mobile browser works fine, but an app would be slicker.
- **Limited info on founders**: Would be nice to know the brains behind the system.
- **$250 minimum deposit**: Not crazy, but could be a hurdle for some beginners.

Overall, the pros definitely outweigh the cons for most users.

I wanted to share something for those trying to understand lupus — whether for yourself or someone you care about, and especially for help explaining it to loved ones. I t’s often times hard to explain because it's invisible and unpredictable, but here are some ways that might help.

Simple Explanation:
Lupus is an autoimmune disease. Your immune system is supposed to protect you — but with lupus, it gets confused and starts attacking your own healthy tissue. This can affect your joints, skin, kidneys, brain, and more.
---
“Lupus is like having a guard dog that suddenly turns on its owner. It was trained to protect you, but now it bites everything — even you.”
---
“Imagine your immune system as a building's alarm system. Normally it goes off for intruders. But with lupus, it goes off when it sees the cleaning crew, the mailman, even the people who live there. It starts damaging the building from the inside.”
---
“It feels like being in a constant battle with your own body. You look fine on the outside, but you're fighting invisible pain on the inside.”
--
“Lupus is like your immune system being overdramatic — throwing tantrums over nothing. ‘Oh, you're stressed? You stayed up late? Guess what: joint pain, brain fog, and fatigue for you!’”
---
“Picture your immune system as a superhero team. But with lupus, they start attacking the very city they're supposed to protect — causing chaos inside your body.”
---
""The War Within”

 Maya looked perfectly fine. Her skin glowed under the spring sunlight, her smile easy and bright. But what people couldn’t see was the storm beneath her skin.
Inside her, a war raged....
  Her immune system — once loyal protectors — now confused, attacked her joints and organs like they were the enemy. Some days, Maya could barely lift a coffee mug. Other days, she forgot words mid-sentence, her brain fog thick as soup.   
  At work, people joked, “You’re too young to be this tired.” She laughed with them, but it stung. They didn’t see the morning pain or how just existing could feel like climbing a mountain.
  One night, she dreamed her body was a city under attack by confused superheroes. “We thought we were protecting you…” they whispered..

My family sat by the service table where the staff served fresh coffee in front of you. We saw some people just left a piece of clothing on one of the chairs and a mini white bag in front of another chair but no one sitting there. So we just sat down and ordered what we wanted, witnessed the servers brewing our coffee infront of us, got it served to us, given our desserts and already started eating. This entire process took 20mins or so. Then a couple of Japanese people came with a tray of food and said this is their seat. Apparantly they left clothing there to reserve their spot and went to buy food. If you never been to the Statbucks Reserve, it's a very busy and crowded place. And because we can't speak Japanese properly, in the end, we got moved to the side on a small tea table. Now I'm confused and somewhat bitter that we sat down, got served, and started eating. But we got forced to move to the side because a couple placed a clothing on a chair to reserve ahead of time. That means no one can sit around the table if everyone just place a piece of clothing at the chair. 
Now I am leaving the place with a bitter feel. But I am not sure of the culture here in Japan and I am just wondering if someone can elaborate on the idea for me.

# Best Cortado Cup 2025: Find Your Perfect Size!

The cortado, a beloved espresso beverage consisting of roughly equal parts espresso and steamed milk, demands a specific type of cup to truly appreciate its nuanced flavor profile. Finding the perfect cortado cup can elevate your coffee ritual from a simple caffeine fix to a sophisticated sensory experience. This review explores the top cortado cups of 2025, focusing on size, material, design, and overall suitability for crafting the ideal cortado.

[[Browse top-rated cortado cup on Amazon]](https://petsknows.com/hot-selling-items/?kw=cortado+cup)
 ## Key Features Analysis

The ideal cortado cup possesses several crucial characteristics that contribute to its functionality and aesthetic appeal.

**Capacity:** Cortado cups typically range from 4 to 6 ounces (120 to 180 ml). This size is essential for maintaining the correct espresso-to-milk ratio. A cup that is too large will result in a diluted or latte-like beverage, while a cup that is too small will not allow for adequate milk integration.

The perfect size is subjective and depends on personal preference. Some prefer a smaller, more concentrated cortado in a 4-ounce cup, while others enjoy a slightly larger, milkier version in a 6-ounce cup. The sweet spot often lands around 5 ounces, providing a balanced ratio for both flavor and volume.

**Material:** Ceramic and glass are the most common materials used for cortado cups, each offering distinct advantages. Ceramic cups excel at heat retention, keeping your cortado warm for a longer period. They also offer a wide variety of aesthetic designs and finishes. Glass cups, especially double-walled options, provide excellent insulation while showcasing the beautiful layers of espresso and milk. They are also generally dishwasher safe, adding to their convenience.

The choice of material often comes down to personal preference. If you prioritize heat retention and aesthetic variety, ceramic might be the better choice. If you value visual appeal and ease of cleaning, glass could be more suitable.

**Shape and Design:** The shape of a cortado cup can influence both the drinking experience and the perceived aroma of the beverage. A slightly flared rim can enhance the release of aromas, while a tapered base can help maintain the temperature of the espresso. Handles can improve the comfort and grip, but some prefer a handle-less design for a more minimalist aesthetic.

The design should also consider the stackability of the cups for efficient storage. Many cortado cups are designed with a slightly wider top that allows them to nest securely within each other, saving valuable cabinet space. The overall aesthetic should complement your personal style and the atmosphere of your coffee-drinking environment.

**Durability:** A quality cortado cup should be durable enough to withstand daily use and regular washing. Look for cups made from high-fired ceramic or tempered glass, as these materials are less prone to chipping or cracking. The construction should be solid and well-crafted, without any visible flaws or weaknesses.

Durability also extends to the cup's finish. If you choose a ceramic cup, ensure that the glaze is resistant to scratching and staining. If you opt for a glass cup, check that it is thermal shock resistant to prevent shattering when exposed to sudden temperature changes.

**Heat Retention:** One of the key characteristics is how well the cup can hold heat. A cup with good heat retention will keep the cortado warmer for longer, allowing the drinker to savor the drink at the optimal temperature.

Double-walled glass cups are particularly effective at heat retention due to the insulating air gap between the inner and outer walls. Ceramic cups, especially those with thicker walls, also provide excellent heat retention.

 ## Core Benefits

A well-chosen cortado cup can significantly enhance the overall coffee-drinking experience, offering a range of practical and sensory benefits.

**Enhanced Flavor Perception:** The shape and material of a cortado cup can influence how you perceive the flavors and aromas of the beverage. A flared rim, for example, can direct the aromas towards your nose, allowing you to fully appreciate the nuances of the espresso and milk. The material can also impact the taste, with some believing that ceramic cups enhance the sweetness of the coffee, while glass cups provide a more neutral flavor profile.

By choosing a cup that complements the characteristics of your espresso blend, you can unlock the full potential of your cortado.

**Improved Temperature Maintenance:** A good cortado cup should effectively maintain the temperature of the beverage, keeping it warm for a longer period. This is especially important for cortados, as the milk can cool down the espresso quickly if the cup is not properly insulated. Double-walled glass cups and thick-walled ceramic cups are particularly effective at retaining heat.

This feature ensures that you can savor your cortado at the optimal temperature, enjoying the full range of flavors and aromas without the disappointment of a lukewarm beverage.

**Elevated Aesthetic Experience:** A beautiful cortado cup can add a touch of elegance and sophistication to your coffee ritual. The design, color, and texture of the cup can enhance the overall sensory experience, creating a more enjoyable and relaxing moment. Whether you prefer a minimalist, modern design or a more ornate, traditional style, there is a cortado cup to suit your taste.

The visual appeal of the cup can also elevate the presentation of your cortado, making it feel more special and luxurious.

**Comfortable Handling:** A well-designed cortado cup should be comfortable to hold, even when filled with hot liquid. Handles provide a secure grip and prevent your fingers from getting burned, while handle-less cups should have a slightly textured surface for added grip. The weight and balance of the cup should also be considered, as a cup that is too heavy or unbalanced can be difficult to hold comfortably.

Ergonomic design ensures that you can enjoy your cortado without any discomfort or strain.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about cortado cups:

**What is the ideal size for a cortado cup?**

The ideal size is generally between 4 and 6 ounces (120-180 ml). This range allows for the proper espresso-to-milk ratio without making the drink too diluted or too small. Personal preference dictates the exact size within this range.

**Are glass or ceramic cortado cups better?**

Both materials have their advantages. Ceramic excels at heat retention and offers more design variety, while glass, especially double-walled glass, provides excellent insulation and allows you to see the layers of the drink. The ""better"" choice depends on your individual priorities.

**How do I clean my cortado cup?**

Most cortado cups are dishwasher safe, but it is always best to check the manufacturer's instructions. Hand-washing is generally recommended for delicate cups or those with intricate designs. Use a mild detergent and avoid abrasive cleaners that could scratch the surface.

1k83byn,https://www.reddit.com/r/huntertheparenting/comments/1k83byn/question_about_detectivesergeant_chapman/,Question about Detective-Sergeant Chapman,"So, Guy Chapman, we know him.

Policeman, proud father, patriarch of his little family, and enjoyer of a very small corner of paradise, taking what little happiness he can grab from a cold, uncaring world.  
But also a ghoul, a slave to his desire, an addict, and a murderer barely holding it together, who may or may not be a sociopath, or a psychopath, that part is unclear.

What is Chapman's deal? His desire to work the police force and the fact that he's a pretty decent detective (IF you assume he figured out D was full of it but chose to not comment on it for whatever reason) would paint him as normal, even upstanding citizen, and yet it's counter-balanced by his addiction that led him down a pretty nasty spiral. I mean, he killed people with his teeth, for crying out loud, maybe it's common in Norfolk, but in civilized countries, not so much!

So my question is: **was Guy already screwed before getting his coffee spiked and having his life ruined by the Regent's blood bound, or is everything the Regent's fault?** I haven't seen anything suggesting he was weird before developping his vitae addiction, but we have heard plenty about how screwed up he is since.",7,1745637286.0,huntertheparenting,9,1.0,False

I also don't have weird or creepy fetishes that plague this place.

1k8383b,https://www.reddit.com/r/USCIS/comments/1k8383b/approved_finally_marriage_based_after_interview/,Approved finally :) Marriage based  - after interview,"I just want to share our story quickly since I've been reading posts here daily since we filed our marriage based AOS last year.

PD - First week of August 2024

Interview - This week DTLA office

Interview went out pretty smooth, officer was chill and friendly, She called us in together, seated next to each other. We were asked couple questions, ""so how you guys met'', how much is your rent, what do you do in free time referred to both . It seemed she already made a decision prior to interview therefore wanted to meet procedural part only. She asked us if we brought some evidence, took only lease to look and make copy off.  
Evidence we submitted with initial application: apartment lease and insurance, phone bill, utilities bill, 7 pictures of ourselves only. We are very old fashion couple in our mid 30' and don't have crazy social life. When asked ""what do you guys do for fun"" I said ""nothing much, we work a lot and we are in recession time, we try to save money so just go out for coffee and eat out"" :) We don't have joint bank account. I have overstayed my visa since 2016, no issue at all. IO just wanted to confirm couple questions, ""have you ever worked without authorization"" I answered YES, ""have you violated any immigration laws"" I answered YES and said I overstayed my vise and worked without authorization. She also revised question regarding "" have you ever been cited, arrested etc"", I checked YES on application and said I had two traffic violations for parking and speeding while she made a change marking NO since I have never been arrested and I signed the revised testimony. She said if you have not been arrested, traffic violations are not counting. We were approved on spot and got update email on portal next day.

Now, few things I want to share with your regarding entire process and filing out application that I learned throughout this process. I do have legal background from overseas and I'm also huge nerd without social life :) so I love learning process.  
We filled out application by referring to youtube videos especially ""Ksenia"" although I did extensive legal research myself. Only remark I found is you should not use any kind of stickers to separate files, just arrange pages well and put huge clipper, that's all. When your package arrives at facility initially, they literally throw everything in the scanner and you can pray there won't be missing pages later on. They would have to remove sticky tabs off and it can be counterproductive only.

Immigration process is administrative in nature similar to applying at DMV. You should not expect judicial procedural standards at all.  
Now, the most important question here is ""what's my processing time"". Looking at block number, comparing your case with others, estimated times etc is all non relevant. There are few dozen FO each with their own headcount and historical backlog. Also, IO vary by experience, work ethics and personal beliefs.  
There's quarterly statistics available on USCIS website breaking down all sorts of applications by field office and type you can refer for processing time.  
One thing is sure, since new administration came in, family based cases are going to be processed much faster as they should be! They were least priority during previous administration even though we fund USCIS along with employment based applications, but having quicker EAD production time for refugees and asylum seekers at no fee compared to family applications is RIDICULOUS. You should refer to this forum to gain some insights related to decision making and comparable experience but I would say that 99% of people here don't know what they are talking about.  
Also, do not listen to ""money making"" "" fearmongering"" immigration attorneys!! I graduated summa cum laude from law school. Especially those that pop out on YouTube all the time, no need to call out anyone.  
If you have legit marriage base case this is the golden age of immigration! :)

 ## Key Features Analysis

The Cozy Cup category is diverse, ranging from simple, insulated tumblers to artisanal ceramic mugs with intricate designs. The best Cozy Cups share several key features that contribute to their superior performance and overall user experience.

**Superior Insulation:** One of the most critical features of a Cozy Cup is its ability to maintain the temperature of your beverage. Look for cups featuring double-walled vacuum insulation, capable of keeping drinks hot for up to 12 hours or cold for up to 24 hours. Materials like 18/8 stainless steel or high-quality borosilicate glass are often used for their excellent insulating properties. The effectiveness of the insulation directly impacts the enjoyment of your drink, preventing lukewarm coffee or watered-down iced tea.

**Comfortable Grip:** A Cozy Cup should feel good in your hand. Ergonomic design is paramount, with features like contoured shapes, textured surfaces, or integrated sleeves enhancing grip and preventing slippage. Consider cups with a matte finish for improved tactile feel and reduced fingerprints. Some Cozy Cups even incorporate materials like silicone or cork on the exterior for added insulation and a more comfortable hold, especially when holding hot beverages.

**Durable Construction:** A quality Cozy Cup is built to last. Materials such as stainless steel, ceramic, or tempered glass offer excellent resistance to scratches, dents, and breakage. Look for cups with reinforced seams and robust construction to withstand daily use and accidental drops. A well-made Cozy Cup is an investment in lasting enjoyment and reduces the need for frequent replacements.

**Leak-Proof Lid:** For on-the-go use, a leak-proof lid is essential. Look for lids with secure seals, often made from silicone or rubber, that prevent spills and leaks. Many Cozy Cups feature lids with integrated sliders or flip-top closures for easy access to your drink. The lid material should also be BPA-free and easy to clean, ensuring both safety and convenience.

**Aesthetic Design:** While functionality is paramount, the aesthetic appeal of a Cozy Cup contributes significantly to the overall experience. Consider cups with visually pleasing designs, attractive colors, and unique textures. Options range from minimalist designs to intricate patterns and artistic embellishments. Choose a Cozy Cup that reflects your personal style and enhances your enjoyment of your daily rituals.

**Easy Cleaning:** The best Cozy Cups are easy to clean, either by hand or in the dishwasher. Look for cups with wide mouths that allow for easy access with a sponge or brush. Dishwasher-safe materials are a significant convenience for busy individuals. Avoid cups with intricate designs or small crevices that can trap residue and make cleaning difficult.

 ## Core Benefits

The advantages of using a Cozy Cup extend beyond simply holding a beverage. These cups enhance the drinking experience in several meaningful ways.

**Maintained Beverage Temperature:** The primary benefit of a Cozy Cup is its ability to keep drinks at the desired temperature for extended periods. Imagine savoring a hot cup of coffee on a cold winter morning, or enjoying an ice-cold beverage throughout a hot summer day, without temperature fluctuations. This consistent temperature enhances the flavor and overall enjoyment of your drink.

**Reduced Condensation:** Many insulated Cozy Cups prevent condensation from forming on the exterior, keeping your hands and surfaces dry. This is especially beneficial for cold beverages, preventing water rings on furniture and slippery grips. This seemingly small detail contributes significantly to a more comfortable and enjoyable drinking experience.

**Environmentally Friendly:** By using a reusable Cozy Cup, you reduce your reliance on disposable cups, contributing to a more sustainable lifestyle. This small change can have a significant impact on reducing waste and minimizing your environmental footprint. Many cafes even offer discounts for customers who bring their own reusable cups, further incentivizing this eco-friendly practice.

**Personalized Experience:** Choosing a Cozy Cup that reflects your personal style allows you to create a more personalized and enjoyable drinking experience. Whether you prefer a minimalist design, a vibrant color, or a unique texture, your Cozy Cup becomes an extension of your personality. This personalized touch can elevate your daily rituals and enhance your overall sense of well-being.

**Enhanced Portability:** Many Cozy Cups are designed for on-the-go use, featuring leak-proof lids and durable construction. This allows you to enjoy your favorite beverages anywhere, whether you're commuting to work, hiking in the mountains, or simply relaxing in the park. The convenience of a portable Cozy Cup ensures that you can always have your preferred drink at the perfect temperature, no matter where you are.

 ## FAQs Section

Consumers often have questions about the functionality, care, and suitability of Cozy Cups. Here are some common questions and answers to guide your purchase decision.

**Are Cozy Cups dishwasher safe?**
  This depends on the specific Cozy Cup. Always check the manufacturer's instructions. Many stainless-steel Cozy Cups are dishwasher safe, while ceramic or glass cups may require hand washing to prevent damage. Lids are often dishwasher safe, but it's best to verify the material and recommended cleaning method.

**How long will a Cozy Cup keep my drink hot or cold?**
  High-quality, double-walled vacuum insulated Cozy Cups can typically keep drinks hot for up to 12 hours and cold for up to 24 hours. However, the actual duration can vary depending on the ambient temperature, the starting temperature of the beverage, and whether the lid is properly sealed.

**What materials are best for a Cozy Cup?**
  Stainless steel is a popular choice for its durability, insulation properties, and resistance to rust and corrosion. Ceramic offers a classic aesthetic and excellent heat retention, while glass provides a pure taste and allows you to see the contents of your cup. The best material depends on your personal preferences and priorities.

**How do I clean my Cozy Cup effectively?**
  For most Cozy Cups, warm soapy water and a sponge or bottle brush are sufficient for cleaning. For stubborn stains or odors, you can use a mixture of baking soda and water. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, as these can damage the surface of the cup. Regularly cleaning your Cozy Cup will help maintain its hygiene and performance.

They ask you to coffee, but it’s not to talk. It’s to pitch. They’re always “so inspired by your work,” but it turns out they haven’t read any of it. They just know it’s *doing well.*

You stop being a person and start being a ladder.

And it’s subtle. It’s not just the clout-chasers or name-droppers. It’s old friends who suddenly resurface when you get attention. It’s colleagues who say “we should collab” but only when they need your platform. It’s people who cheer for your success as long as it doesn’t put you ahead of them.

Eventually, you start to question everyone. The compliments feel transactional. The attention feels earned *for the wrong reasons.* And the worst part? You start to isolate. Because you can’t tell who’s real anymore.

Im leaning towards eliminating as many of these triggers as I can but as everyone here knows it’s a battle regardless. Is it easier to quit when you eliminate them, or when you face them head on and carry each small win to your next battle? I gotta say it felt great today when I went to my normal gas station and the guy went to pull of my normal zyn of choice from behind the counter and I said no thanks I just want a water.

I just bought the 16"" MBP m4 Pro in Space Black! I am loving how the computer is working so far and how smooth everything is (I just traded in my 13"" 2017 MBP Intel core so you could see how life-changing this is for me lol). However, I am thinking about maybe returning for a 14"", and in Silver. I just really want to get someone else's opinion because I'm not sure if it's the computer for me, or I'm just being crazy.

I am graduating in a couple weeks and so thus why I bought a new laptop. I am a graphic/motion designer so I need high specs and such. The size is just so big which I do like but it also feel a little uncomfortable to work with. In class we work on iMacs which are huge and I like those but it's a little different in laptop form even if it's only 16"" compared to the 24"" iMacs. I am considering getting an iMac in a couple years for a desk so that is another reason why I am thinking about switching the 16"" for the 14"". I want something more portable because I do enjoy working in coffee shops and traveling. The 16"" is really heavy and a little annoying to carry as it is bigger. I never had a problem with my 13"" and I liked that, so I'm thinking about reverting.

Another thing I'm thinking about is color. My old MBP was Space Grey which I loved but I know they do not have available in the new MBPs so I got Space Black. It's super sleek and nice but I notice during the day it's hard to work on for me personally because it's so dark. Definitely nice at night but I work more during the day. I also like the way on the silver the keyboard is more separated from the color of the actual computer if that makes sense. Also, I notice I keep getting fingerprints on it, and I thought about it and I think it'll be harder to keep the Space Black clean and free from noticeable scratches unlike the Silver.

Size is definitely the most important thing I need advice on but also the color has been weighing on my mind too.

Additional question if I do decide to return: is it possible I can go to the store and do all the migrating here from the new one, or do I need to return this one before I can get the new one?

Sorry for the long post but I'm so conflicted and don't want to waste my money. If y'all could help me out it would be much appreciated!",6,1745636081.0,macbookpro,17,1.0,False

I told her she could stay with me and my family Saturday night, and come to the graduation with us, and I would drop her off at her friends house after to this she did not reply. I told her if not, it’s probably cheaper to rent a car. She said I do not have money to rent a car, but she had advised me she was Uber in from one airport to her friends house and stopping for coffee at a local coffee shop on the way and that she was Uber from her friends house to an alternate airport on Monday. I told her this alone is about $100 in Ubers, which it is. I fact checked it. Then I did research myself and saw a rental for $130 and I told her again she can either stay with us Saturday and come with us to the ceremony or she would have to find her own way there.

Our experiences are profoundly different, and we’ve been trying to figure out why (I have some guesses, but I don’t want to bias the responses too much), mostly because she’s been trying to help me and doesn’t understand why I don’t seem to have as much luck with men treating her well as she does. 

My first dates are often what you’d expect: someone suggesting coffee or a drink or a casual meal. I’m fine with this! I’m not passive and will suggest we meet up if they don’t and will be an active participant in planning. I get a reasonable number of flakes (I’d imagine about average) who end up bailing last minute. Many of them are won’t plan anything more than a couple of days out. I don’t expect to be paid for and always offer to split. I assumed this was all pretty common and just part of the slog. 

Ok, now onto her. She matches with guys who unprompted (she’s not asking for fancy dates), plan fairly elaborate (often expensive) looooong first dates that require them to drive an hour+ each way. Think dinner at a nice restaurant followed by a concert or 5th row seats to an NBA game. They also go out their way to make sure she’s comfortable and just seem to be generally thoughtful and considerate and like they are very much trying to woo her. 

She always insists on video chatting as an intro with them before committing to a first date, but other than texting, that’s all the contact they will have had. These guys are not only planning these things, they’re committing to them a week+ out and sticking to it. She rarely gets guys bailing. I know she’s not promising sex and takes things very quite slowly. 

She regularly has first dates where men are putting in more effort than I have EVER had a man do, including ones that I’ve been in a relationship with. 

My friend thinks my bar is too low and that esp given my history, I should have higher expectations of men putting in some sort of work to date me because it’s a signal for how good they will be to me in a relationship. I’ve read so much about how men resent being “taken advantage of” and having to do all the work in dating that I’m hyper-aware of not being that person, but I do wonder if I’m shooting myself in the foot somehow. 

Anyone got some good insights for me? Like I said, this has been an ongoing discussion with us, so we have some hypotheses, but I’d love to get some outside perspectives. Happy to provide more details if anything else would be helpful.

I’m an international student in the US, and lately, I’ve been feeling really lonely.
Most of my close friends graduated and moved on, and now I find myself spending a lot of time alone. For some reason, I haven’t been very successful in relationships here either — no girlfriend, no real romantic connections. I think I underestimated how hard it would be to rebuild a social life once your core group leaves.

It’s hard to find new friends, especially when you’re no longer a freshman and everyone already seems to have their own circles. I try to stay busy with school and work, but honestly, it feels like something is missing. I miss having people to just hang out with, talk to, or even do simple things like grab coffee or watch a movie.

If anyone has been through something similar, how did you deal with it? How do you push through the loneliness and find new connections when it feels so overwhelming?

the problem is my HM is pretty passive aggressive and not direct at all. she never asks me to do any extra specific tasks which at first gave me the impression that they were just very easy going people, but, as time went on she started making passive aggressive comments and once gave me a whole speech about how it would be really nice of me to “pitch in for once” and walk and feed the dog and clean their dishes because i’m “part of the family” and because they (sometimes) make dinner for me. when that is not what i’m here for. i’m here to take care of their kids. and i get it, i live here. cleaning up MY OWN stuff is pretty much obligatory, basic decency even, but why should i have to wash your coffee mug and tupperwares and put away the food that you use when i’m literally busy taking care of your children and cleaning after them/doing their never ending laundry? idk the guilt tripping is just so crazy to me.
i already don’t feel comfortable living here. this is not my country, this is not my house and this is not my family. i feel so out of place and they don’t even try to make me feel welcome. like the people pleaser i am, in the moment, i just said “i appreciate you telling me this, i’ll keep it in mind” but as time has gone on i just feel like i shouldn’t have stayed quiet. but then again i just don’t feel that comfortable speaking up which i know i should work on especially when i’m living with strangers who are also my bosses.
they also make me feel guilty whenever i go out. they often imply that i should spend more time with them “as a family” (e.g. go with them to the kids’ dance class at 9 am when it’s my only free day and god forbid i want to sleep in for once) like i said, it’s my only free day the whole week and respectfully, i would go crazy if i don’t get out of that house and have peace and quiet. like is it such a bad thing to not want to hear kids screaming and crying 24/7? they sure don’t like having to deal with it, you’d think they’d understand why someone would need a break lol
i should also say that my relationship with the kids is pretty good. they can be really difficult and do not understand what the word ‘no’ means, parents don’t know how to set boundaries which is exhausting but that’s actually not even my main complaint. my point is the kids like me. even HP are pleasantly surprised by how well they adapted since it didn’t go so well with their last au pair. so idk, i think it’s fair that i get one free day without feeling guilty for not being with all of them all day",0,1745635132.0,Aupairs,1,0.5,False

1k82gb4,https://i.redd.it/d0tv7eocb3xe1.jpeg,Brief summary on a survivor concept I had based on a character of mine,"Alright so I have this rat named Nick and I was imagining him as a survivor in Forsaken (don't ask why) so I'm just gonna briefly give what his abilities are and stuff

Name: Nick Roddy

Description: 

Difficulty: 3 stars

Health: 25

Walk speed: 14

Run speed: 28

Stamina: 105

Stamina loss: 10/s

Stamina gain: 20/s

Gameplay:

Nick is solely a support mixed with a ""sentinel"" I say that very loosely because what he does is gives a small speed buff to other survivors with Starblox latte while also working as a looper, his speed makes him hard to catch but he's very fragile and easy to kill so any good killer with a ranged ability will pretty much make quick work of him. God forbid a Jason gaping wounds him.

Passives:

Rat-like: Nick being a rat has the speed and frailty of one. +2 to walk and run speed while having 25 health.

Abilities:

Whistle (Q): Let out a loud whistle revealing your aura to the killer, all survivors but Nick get resistance 3 for 6 seconds. Cooldown is 40s. (this ability essentially makes Nick a higher priority as the other survivors are harder to kill except for Nick)

Description: ""Hey come get me, you wuss!"" - Nick

Coffee time (E): Nick pulls out a Starblox latte and chugs it, being slightly slowed for the duration of the animation (1.25s), he gains speed 3 and his stamina depletion is halved for 5 seconds. Once the 5 seconds are up he gains slowness 2 and his stamina regeneration is halved for 5 seconds. Cooldown is 60 seconds and has 3 uses. (this ability works as a panic button as well as a way to get to other survivors faster)

Description: ""You drink any more of those and you'll get a heart attack."" - Ratticus

Free sample (R): Nick hands out a Starblox latte and it will be in his hand for 5 seconds, survivors that stand in the hitbox trigger will get speed 2 and have their stamina depletion reduced by 20% for 8 seconds. If no survivors take it then he'll put it back. Cooldown when someone takes the Starblox latte is 35 seconds, cooldown when nobody takes it is 15 seconds. (This ability is similar to Elliots pizza throw except you don't throw the latte, you just hand it out and instead of healing you, it makes it easier to escape the killer or get to a survivor.)

1k82dqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k82dqn/aitah_for_accidentally_allowing_my_sister_to/,AITAH for accidentally allowing my sister to leave our family at church on Sunday so she could sneak to her boyfriend’s house?,"I don’t even know how I am being blamed in this situation, honestly. I fully 100% believe I am not the asshole here but my parents are so mad at me that I’m coming here to seek out some other views. 

  So obviously as the title suggests, this happened on Easter Sunday last week. This story involves me (f20), my little sister (f16), my little brother (m13), my youngest sisters (f8 and f9), mom and my dad both in their 40s and my husband (m26). My family goes to church every single Sunday so obviously Easter Sunday was no different. The service started at 8 so me and my husband showed up to my parent’s house at 7:15 so everyone could ride together. 

  For context, up until I got married very recently and moved out, I would help my mom and dad a lot around the house and with my younger siblings. My mom has told me multiple times since I moved out how much she misses my help. I do my best to still come around as often as possible but I am finishing my degree and also actively applying for jobs for when I graduate, as well as doing an internship and also being newly married! It’s just a lot. 

  Well at 7:15, absolutely nobody in that house was ready. Brother was throwing a tantrum as teenage boys do, dad was arguing with him, mom was trying to make coffee and the machine was broken, my littlest sisters were fighting over a hairbrush and whacking each other with it, and my little sister, 16, was sitting on the couch looking very sick. She’s usually the one who’s very put together so I asked her if she was okay. She said yes, but told me she had a stomache, and asked if she could drive her own car to church just in case she had to leave because she was sick. I said I didn’t care, especially because even though she felt sick she was the only one who was semi ready to go. 

  When we finally left my mom harped a few things about my sister just wanting to drive her new car (just recently turned 16 and started driving) but I just ignored it because honestly, she really did seem sick and her car was right behind us the whole time. 

  About 20 mins after service started, my sister got up and left. She texted me and my mom in a groupchat and told us she was having girl problems and her stomach was really upset so she had to go and didn’t want to say anything in front of everyone. Again, that was a good enough excuse for me. 

  Wellll except for the fact that her “hack” of trying to turn off her phone at the last location (home) didn’t work. Even though her phone was off driving to church, and then to her boyfriend’s house, it tracked her both places and my mom found out quickly. 

  Needless to say my mom was livid. She cursed my little sister out, grounded her, took her phone, and told her she can’t see her boyfriend for months. Apparently my sister had been begging to go to his house for months and my mom hasn’t let her. And then I, as an adult, got scolded and reprimanded like a child for it and “allowing” my sister to do that. My mom accused me of knowing her plans and letting her do it, which obviously isn’t true. 

  I couldn’t believe it. First of all, she’s my sister not my kid and second of all how was i supposed to know. She really did seem sick. I left my parent’s  house crying that day because of how frustrated I was. 

  My husband obviously has been saying it’s not my fault and I shouldn’t be letting it affect me this much, but it truly truly is. I honestly don’t think my mom has thought about it since Sunday but I have so many times. Why is my fault??? Is it my fault??? ",28,1745634199.0,AITAH,27,0.94,False

I get along all right with one of my roommates. They’re pretty chill. It’s the other two I have a problem with because they are always having parties and playing loud ass music. I know that that’s to be expected in college, but this is every other night. It’s not just on the weekends. 

They bring over a bunch of people at three in the morning without any sort of notice. I’m usually studying or in bed by then and then all of a sudden a bunch of people shouting in the comment area, blaring music so loud it shakes the walls and I can’t hear myself think. Sometimes I’m going have a quiet day and they bring over like 10 people at six in the morning and it goes on all day.

I’ve been dealing with it by going over to the coffee shop. Unfortunately the study areas on campus are only open 9 to 5 and I’m usually in class then. I don’t mind going to the coffee shop, but the Wi-Fi there kind of sucks and I need an internet connection to do most of my homework. I’m supposed to get my own dorm next semester.

I love my job, but it is one of the top most stressful jobs in the country. I also run a business with my husband, which admittedly, is my passion. I also do all the household chores.
My husband (36m) works 36 hours a week at a gas station. His only passion is rock climbing, but he also helps with the business. 
He recently left to go hang out with some friends for a week and I had the business and my normal work hours. The business takes about 2 hours of work a day and there is no putting it off, especially cause we’re still small and don’t have some automatic features so it takes some juggling to make it work. 
Today, I had to go pick up a couple of items for the business so I asked him to help me load a large crate in the back of the truck so I could leave. He sat there drinking his coffee and playing on his phone. I asked again as I was putting on my shoes and he snapped back with “it doesn’t take long for me to do it and you’re not even ready so why are you rushing me?”
I told him “because you’re lazy and it takes you forever to get off the couch and I need to leave” 
He got even more mad and said “you’re calling me lazy? Making someone wait isn’t going to kill you, but if you’re so worried about leaving on time maybe I should just leave the marriage” (for context I am overweight and he is very athletic so his thinking is all overweight people are too lazy to workout)
Now, I pay for everything: the house, the utilities and the business. His car, insurance, phone is all financed by me. His paycheck goes to climbing equipment and travels only. So I told him “well, bye” cause I know I’d be fine on my own and I literally teach manipulation tactics at work and viewed it as one. 
But maybe I’m the AH for hurting his feelings. ",98,1745634185.0,AITAH,87,0.95,False

1k829zd,https://www.reddit.com/r/smartwatch/comments/1k829zd/opinion_on_smartwatch_sought/,Opinion on smartwatch sought,"Hey all,

So I am going to be ordering the new Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 to replace my current phone which is on its last legs. I am thinking of getting a smartwatch to go with it. I am only really interested in notifications and running apps/widgets for some of my installed Android apps. Any fitness stuff is a bonus, but not my main focus.

I was looking at the Motorola Moto Watch 120 as a possible choice. Partially because it got good reviews and has notification options, and partially because it would be the same brand as my new phone. And it is going for a good price for my budget (I can go higher, but this is nice). My concern is that being the same brand isn't going to gain me anything and since the Moto Watch doesn't run WearOS, the available apps/widgets are limited compared to watches that do run WearOS.

So if the brand matching isn't that crucial, should I just go with whatever watch does everything I want, at a price I can afford, and be done with it? My brain tells me having the same brand of phone and watch doesn't make that big of a deal in the Android universe, but I wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something obvious or important that I should be considering. Thanks in advance for any thoughts/ideas/recommendations/etc.
