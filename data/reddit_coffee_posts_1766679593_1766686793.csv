i did my research, ground a bag of espresso beans to be medium/fine, cleaned the pot with baking soda and vinegar, filled w warm water to the valve, shut it as tight as i could, and began brewing at low heat. i figured it’d take maybe 15 minutes or so but an hour later and this is all that’s come out.

im thinking either my beans need to be ground finer, i need to screw it tighter, or i need a new moka pot all together and this is probably exactly why it ended up at the thrift store lol.

i continued to see her in the morning frequently, and we would talk. fast forward a couple of months and things are going really great, i really start to fall for her and her personality is so adorable and bubbly. 

i’ve told her before that i’m working just to pay rent but I’m in school to become a chef, i have a passion for cooking. so we’ve always kind of talked about cooking and what we’ve made before, turns out she likes baking.

we’ve only ever spoken when we meet at the cafe, i’ve never asked her for her number i wanted to sort of keep the magic, one morning before work i bump into her and we say hi then i tell her i’m free Friday next week and ask her if she’d want to come over to my place so we can bake.

and she just completely didn’t like that idea whatsoever and she made it very clear that she was uncomfortable. so i just backed off said no worries if your not comfortable with that then its all good. and so she says thank you for being so understanding. that seemed to be the end of it then next time i see her she tells me that she doesn’t want to talk to me again, and me asking her to come over made her really uncomfortable that i would even suggest that and said it would he best if we didnt speak anymore.

She didn't make any noise, but she immediately took off like a rocket out of the room, and when I went after her, she was touching her paw to her face and eye where drops of the hot coffee had hit her. After a few minutes she settled down and came back to beg for the treats some more.

She is now mostly keeping that eye open but blinking it more than the other eye. There's no visible sign of injury I can see. It's a little watery but not excessively so. She isn't pawing at it. She ate the treats and is definitely far more interested in scheming to get more than anything regarding her potential injuries. It's been about 20 minutes since this happened.

I looked her over and couldn't see any obvious burns anywhere on her face or head, but is there anything I should look for or do about that?

1pvj3mu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1pvj3mu/dbt_skills_to_cope_ahead_happy_holidays_love/,"DBT skills to cope ahead. Happy holidays, love napkin","Hi chat,

Holidays are a very tough time for a lot of us here. We might have very invalidating, disruptive or even abusive family members we have to be around, or we might not have a lot of people in our lives to connect with. 

The feelings of grief, disappointment, isolation, rejection, abandonment, and sadness can feel very overwhelming, even as we go into January. I’ve been there. Many times. 

I want to send love and validation and well wishes, and I’d like to share some DBT skills that have helped me get through painful emotions during these times: 

# Self Soothing 

Focus on soothing yourself with the senses that you can access the most easily.

I like to wrap myself in very soft, warm blankets. I will wear comfy sweatpants and hoodies; pet my cat and feel him purring; and make a hot cup of tea and feel the warmth. I'll put on a calming lo-fi, fireplace sounds, or music with piano in it. 

These don't make the problem go away, but they help me to bring the intensity of the emotion down a bit so I can cope with it easier.

# Accumulate Positives 

This skill focuses on intentionally engaging in pleasant activities and sparking joy in order to offset feelings of despair. When we engage in things we love or that spark joy, it's like putting stuff in your emotional savings account so you're not running on empty and feeling like you have NO joy or anything to live for.

I struggle with seasonal depression so I use this skill a lot. I like to bake easy things, make art, play video games, scroll and look at memes, hang out with my cat, make yummy coffees or hot chocolates, and build lego. Fuckin love legos. I also love to send nice messages to my friends and make others feel joy or laughter. 

# Radical Acceptance 

Acceptance doesn't mean you have to force yourself to like or agree with what's happening, but rather just to understand and acknowledge, without judgement of how we feel. 

For example, when I practice radical acceptance with difficult family it looks like:

* I don't like talking about politics with family, but they're gonna do it anyway and if I try to change or express that, it's gonna cause problems that I don't want, so I'm going to remove myself from the room or offer nothing substantial to this conversation. Cause I don't feel comfortable with it. And I'm allowed to feel that way.
* I highly dislike a few of my family members because they act in ways that low key disgust me. I understand that this won't change, and I'm not gonna force myself to like them. Instead I only respond to them when it's absolutely necessary, and let go of urges or thoughts that I should argue with them or tell them off. Cause that won't do much.

I accept what I cannot change, and focus on what I can. A lot of the time that involves me helping with cooking or gravitating toward people in my family I have a decent relationship with.

# Willingness

This builds off of radical acceptance and deals with the part where we're gonna focus on what we can change or work with.

If, for example, I was fighting reality, I would potentially start an argument about politics or family drama. I'd be getting defensive about stupid comments being made either to me or in general and starting shit. I'd be trying to make reality (or in this case, people) be what I want it to be.

If I'm in a state of Willingness, it doesn't mean I'm going to be passively going along with everything and being happy about it. It can look like responding to stupid advice with ""Oh for sure, I will totally consider that"" (and then forgetting it lol), or doing anything that's working with what's happening right now.

Sometimes, Willingness is making the most out of being alone on Christmas. Sometimes it's not going to dinner because that environment is way too powerfully dysfunctional for your DBT skills. Sometimes it's staying home and resting because you're too sick to go out. Every time, it means doing the best you can to work with whatever reality is giving you right now even if it's not ideal.

  
I hope everyone reading has a restful holiday with warmth and joy sprinkled in, and I hope this helped even a little bit.

Cheers,

1pvj2uo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1pvj2uo/day_124_i_got_robbed_during_a_camera_sale_and/,Day 124: I got robbed during a camera sale and handled It very differently than I used to,"**Very interesting coincidence.**

Up until today, everything had been going pretty smoothly. I made a post on Facebook Marketplace and planned to sell a camera. I’ve been selling on FB for a while, so this was a regular routine for me.

We scheduled a time with the buyer. I did a verification call on the phone like I always do, and we agreed to meet inside Starbucks.

As soon as I got there, I sat him in a corner to have more control. Once he started checking the camera, about five seconds later he rushed to the door and started running. I caught him and pushed him, and he almost fell. When he exited the door, I jumped on him a second time, but he shook me off and ran to his partner’s car. I took a video, and they drove away.

Now, there’s a high chance he had a gun. I didn’t see it personally, but people get shot in California over a bottle of Coke. He could’ve pulled a knife or a gun without hesitation.

After the incident, the Starbucks staff were super kind and even made me a free coffee. The police showed up relatively quickly and filed a report.

What’s interesting is that this time my intuition didn’t flinch. I wasn’t able to catch red flags like I usually do. Maybe my heart chakra opened and I started trusting people more, or maybe something else, I don’t know. But I’m 1000% sure that if I wasn’t on semen retention, things could’ve ended way worse. Maybe I wouldn’t even be writing this post right now.

I’m still trying to understand how I attracted this and what the lesson is here.

**Option 1:**  
A new test or exam before entering a new level. A year ago, after an experience like this, I would’ve immediately self soothed with porn or rushed to an Asian massage parlor. This time, after losing about $6K worth of equipment, I came home and went straight to the gym for an hour like nothing happened.

**Option 2:**  
Over the last 2 to 3 weeks, I was edging, not touching or masturbating, but mentally engaging by looking at escort websites, dating apps, and random girls on Instagram. No porn though. I’m suspecting that after reaching and passing 100 days, you’re being watched more closely, and even mental celibacy is required at this stage. Maybe this was a penalty for my actions. Maybe I’m tripping, maybe not.

**Option 3 (this one is interesting):**  
We know semen retention affects people around you, especially family members. My father is in another country and struggles with porn and sex addiction. Hypothetically, if he masturbated heavily the day before, for example five times with porn or escorts, could that affect me energetically even if I’m on retention? I know this sounds woo woo, but I’m open to a respectful debate or conversation.

I know some people might laugh at this post, but experienced practitioners might resonate with what I wrote. If you’ve had a similar experience or have feedback, feel free to share. I’m open.",1,1766686190.0,Semenretention,0,0.67,False
1pvj2uj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/comments/1pvj2uj/how_do_you_view_sexuality/,How do you view sexuality?,"The gifts are all unwrapped, coffee (for the adults) and cinnamon rolls consumed, Disney parade viewed (on TV), and all the wrapping paper/bags/boxes properly disposed of.

The family is resting and I am working on a project for a last minute Christmas gift I want to give to one of our neighbors.

I needed to change clothes for the work I’m doing so I came upstairs just now and noticed the entire second floor is empty. Our kids are occupied and my BS is sleeping on the couch downstairs.

This is/was prime acting out time for me. I can  head into my home office right now. I can instantly find material that would will allow me to fantasize about hooking up with a beautiful young nameless person - or maybe some couple or maybe a big group… I get to choose whatever I want. I could download some app and use reddit to find a willing partner even to view this with. 

I could escape from my existence and my life for 30-45 minutes.

This thought hit me as I was changing my clothes and noticing my own body. It’s not what I want. I’ve slowed down exercising and started drinking more. It’s taking its toll on me. Thinking about this makes me ever so depressed and full of self-hatred - like if I spend too long on this I might hop in the car and drive it straight into a tree. 

But in my office there are people ready to perform for me and there are people on apps who like what I look like. That sparked a familiar tingle and almost like on auto pilot I began heading there.

Then I remembered a question my therapist asked me once. I don’t recall the context but I remember her saying: “I guess it depends on what you believe sexuality is for”.

This is what I really wanted to write about and hear other inputs. The question has really stuck with me because I think I have a broken view here. To me sex/orgasm is like a bodily function. It’s mechanical. When I’m hungry I eat, when I’m tired I rest, when I have an injury I apply first aid, when I feel productive I try to solve problems. And when I feel a desire for pleasure, I give myself an orgasm.

My therapist tried asking me if I thought sex was special and to be shared between me and my partner. And to me I don’t see it as some connecting thing. I see the act of meeting a new person, gaining their trust, learning to trust them, exposing my body and seeing theirs, and then giving and receiving pleasure. And then the first next experiences after the first time are also somewhat new because there is still learning each others things.

But I guess I don’t see the act of it as that connected. After I had sex with someone I did see them as different - they were a person who I knew what they looked like undressed, I knew other sensations about them as well. That was my “connection” experience.

And this is what I think is broken about me. I imagine others experience something more that I don’t understand. And I guess something that scares me about not understanding it is I don’t know if it’s because my character defects are preventing the understanding OR I have a partner where we just aren’t on that same level (like I have the capacity to understand but we don’t reach whatever connection that others experience).

So I guess I’m curious how others view sexuality. How do you see it?

* Do you save and experience with just that person? Does that also mean you avoid having any experience just by yourself (ie no masturbation)? 

* Do you always approach your partner when you feel that desire? Do you ever just ignore it and is it easy/difficult for you to ignore? 

* Do you have an emotional experience as well as a physical one? Can you describe it?

* Are your answers influenced by any belief system you have? Or where do you think you formed these opinions?",1,1766686190.0,AsOneAfterInfidelity,2,1.0,False

Ive been fully remote for a while and only recently noticed that some days I barely say a single word out loud. Like literally  none. I wake up, make coffee, scroll a bit, sit down at my desk, type messages, reply in Slack, write emails, get work done, and the whole day just passes in silence. No “hey”, no random  comments, not even talking to myself. 

At first it honestly felt kind of nice.  Peaceful. No forced small talk, no background noise, no constant interruptions. But after some time it started to feel.. off. I caught myself struggling to speak smoothly on calls, like my brain and mouth were slightly out of sync. Sometimes I talk too fast, sometimes I forget what I  was saying mid sentence. Ive even noticed my voice sounds different, quieter, almost unsure, which is weird because I never had that problem before. What really surprised me is how much it affects  my mood. The days blur together way more than they used to. By the evening I feel disconnected, like I wasnt fully present all day, even though I worked and got stuff done. Ive started forcing myself to say things out loud just to break the silence, reading messages out loud,  commenting on what Im doing, even saying dumb stuff like “ok lets do this” before starting a task. Feels silly but it helps a bit. 

I still love remote work and Im not missing the  office at all, but I didnt expect silence to mess with my head this much. Just wondering if anyone else noticed something similar, or if my brain is just being dramatic again.",1,1766686162.0,remotework,0,1.0,False

1pvizbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pvizbi/the_longest_night_part_22_confinement/,The Longest Night - Part 22 Confinement,"Untouched had been the meal left upon the kitchen table, one that should of been Jack's breakfast. The boy having slipped from his spot, to vanish for a short time while both parents had been left to eat. His mother having been the first to comment as she sipped from her cup of coffee. ""My cooking isn't that bad, is it?"" 

Casual had been the answer her husband gave from behind the news paper he read. ""Your cooking is one of a kind dear, He'll warm up to it eventually."" 

""One of a kind huh? I'll make sure to make something extra special for you this evening."" Pointed had been the look she gave from behind the smile as she matched his tone. Paper being lowered just enough for the man to meet her gaze. ""I was only kidding dear, Why else do you think I married you?"" 

Playful had been the nature of the one called father that would dive head first into the inferno that been his mother, To be forced to the floor by the backdraft his words had brought. Satisfying had been the loud crunching of toast that left both to freeze upon the spot. Just how long had the boy been watching the pair toss about the floor like wild animals, Animals had had been left to chuckle instead of growl. From the headlock his father had been caught, he took a moment to calm himself enough to speak in that usual, Fatherly tone. ""Now son, This is just a little game your mother and I like to play, Isn't that right honey?"" 

Quicker had been the taps upon his mother's arm, Releasing the hold she had upon him. Slow to stand to her feet, to adjust the dress she had been wearing. The answer she had given wasn't one his father had been expecting, soft had been words filled with slight worry.- ""Oh dear"" 

Took his father a moment to understand what she meant. Effortlessly his father sat up from the spot he once lay, to take a knee beside his son that had been dressed for school. A hand placed upon his shoulder now as he looked the boy dead in the eye. ""Now sp- ""Jack"" ort"" -His Father paused a brief moment, having been interrupted by his son. ""After what happened yesterday, It was decided you'll be spending the rest of the week in your room, To think about what you've done."" No matter how hard his father tried to read his son's expression, nothing would change in the vacant look given. ""Do you understand. . . , Jack?"" 

Startled slightly by the sudden eerily familiar look his son gave from now squinted eyes. Both caught off guard by the tone the boy gave. ""Crime Doesn't pay"" 

Last words of a child that walked to what would be his cell for the next few days. One that sat at the very end of the hall they had been standing. To take a seat upon the edge of his bed, To find his doll like expression having returned. The perfect word to describe just how motionless the boy had been, as both felt as if they had been watched, even when his eyes did not move. 

Softer had been the words of his mother as she leaned over to whisper in his father's ear. ""I think we should find him something to do, I fear he'll not move from that spot otherwise."" 

""Dad should be by later with his schoolwork, Won't that be fun?"" Sipping from the edge of the coffee cup he had been handed, taking a moment to stare back at the boy that sat upon the edge of the bed. Something about his eyes made it hard for him to break away, He might not have had it not been for the voice of his wife. ""Time to go dear, Otherwise you'll be late to work."" 

Fore arm that had been resting upon his thigh lifting, Handing over the coffee mug held  between his fingers. Moment taken to force himself up from the knee he had been sitting. Both taking the time to smooth out the wrinkles from the suit his father had been wearing. Hat taken from the rack beside the door, To be placed atop his father's head as he made his way outside Returning a moment later to exchange a quick kiss with his wife. ""Take care, I'll see you later."" 

""I'll make sure to have your extra special meal waiting"" Door left to shut now. The boy not once having looked away from his father, following the sounds of his footsteps through the walls of the home as he made his way towards the front of it. To listen to the grinding of gears of the garage door being forced open. The strained grunts of one being forced to roll the thing that had not been a boat, out upon the river made of brick. Clanking of metal being forced into the front. Loud had been the cranking that soon left the thing that had been trapped within the front of the not boat to rumble, and growl with hunger. Strange had been these not metal boats that rolled along brick filled rivers. 

Morning spent cleaning the home, as his mother finally took the time to take a break. Having forgotten about the boy that had been sitting at the end of the hall. Just how many times had he gone unnoticed as she passed him by only for her to notice him now that she stepped into what had always been a vacant room. How surreal had this feeling been, To stare upon the boy she could call her own. How she feared he might vanish the moment she blinked, To wake up from what felt to be a dream. Tender had been the touch of her palm that now stroked across the boy's face, What warmth was felt from his mother's touch. Warmth that washed away the colder touch his own skin that looked of porcelain, yet felt of percaline gave. A moment broken by chimes that marked the start of afternoon. 

""Think you've spent enough time cooped up in here, Think It's about time we find you something to eat sweetie"" 

Spoon in hand, Jack had been left sitting at his spot beside the table. The edge of which had been chest level with the boy, whom had been left eye level with the monstrosity that stared back with it's many eyes from atop his plate. Unnatural had been the shade of green this semi transparent thing would take. The very thing he was now suppose to eat. Slow, had been the boy's arm to try and take a scoop. Slightest had been the touch that was met with such violence of this thing that was left to shake. Several ticks of the clock for such violent motions to slow, to stop. To repeat no matter how many times the boy gave it a more gentle nudge. 

""You've had your fun, Now stop playing with your food."" His mother had been passing by the table to grab something from the other room. Quick would she be to learn just what mistake she had made. Left to nearly jump a foot by how loud the table had slammed. To be hit by chunks of the gelatinous mess that now clung to the back of her dress. Momentarily frozen, before she had been quick to spin upon the spot, To witness the horror of what the boy had just done.

Globs of green left to cling, to slowly roll down the white walls of a kitchen she had left sparkling clean. Slow had she been to look about the kitchen, To wonder how it had even managed to get stuck upon the ceiling. To look upon the table the sound of an explosion came. To find her frying pan lay upon the very spot she had left the jello mold. To watch the boy pick over what was left atop the table, To stuff one of the sausages he had freed from suspended animation. To try one of the olives, one he spat back out into his open hand. Long had the moment felt that he was left to stare upon it, One he now offered to his mother. No words given, To be lifted from the very chair he sat, Having been held up by the spot beneath both arms. Both left to watch a large glob roll down the front of the uniform the boy had been wearing. To be carried off to this bubbling spring his mother called a bath.

Tightly the boy had been wrapped within a towel, Left to smell of  wild flowers as he once more was left to sit upon the edge of his bed. How light hearted had his mothers tone been as she returned from cleaning the kitchen. ""And just what do you think you're looking at buster? If you're waiting for me to clean your cloths, You're out of luck."" 

Sound of mop and bucket being set down in the bathroom. His mother returning with what looked to be a pair of footie pajama's in hand. Made of wool and dyed a deeper shade of red.

""I know it's not bed time, but you'll just have to wear this until we can get you something more to wear."" 

Knocking upon the door front door heard, Both left to try and look out the bedroom window, Whomever had been at the door had been standing just close enough to it to be out of view. ""Now just who could that be."" 

Pajama's set down upon the bed, His mother having vanished down the hall, to vanish once more around the corner. Jack left to watch The Detective walk off, too busy lighting a cigar to notice the boy's stare. His mother returning to find Jack having already changed into the pajama's he had been given. The large stack of books her face had been buried behind  dropped atop the desk that was placed just in front of the window the boy stared. ""What kind of school expects a child to complete all of this in a week?"" 

Muttering to herself a moment, Looking towards the bed, only to find the boy had not been sitting there. What anxiety she felt, quick to look over towards the desk as she feared she had awoken from her dream. Only to find the boy had been sitting at it, with pencil in hand.  How both her mind, and heart raced, hesitant had been the hand that now reached to touch upon her child's face. The boy paused, to turn towards her, to stare up at her once more to offer the olive he had held tightly within his hand. One his mother would not hesitate to take.

Original post date: December 20, 2025

Latest update: December 27, 2025

Trigger Warnings: severe entitlement, financial exploitation, parental mistreatment

Mood Spoiler: >!extremely satisfying nuclear revenge!<

# Original Post: “My son treated me like a maid in my own luxury cabin. So I packed up the food and left.”

Hi Reddit, I (64F) never thought I’d be writing something like this about my own child, but here we are.

For context, I spent 40 years running a high-end catering business. I stood on concrete floors for 14 hours a day, missed holidays, and ruined my knees to pay for my son ""Darius"" (38M) to attend private schools and get a debt-free college degree. I retired five years ago and bought a beautiful log cabin in the Blue Ridge Mountains. It’s my sanctuary. It’s where I go to read, drink tea, and listen to silence.

Darius knows this. Yet, last Friday afternoon, my peace was shattered.

I was sitting by the fire when three massive SUVs tore up my gravel driveway. It was Darius, his wife ""Tanya,"" and 10 members of her extended family (The Jenkins). They hadn’t called. They hadn’t asked. Darius just used his emergency key code, barged in, and announced, ""We’re staying for the week! Mom, get the guest beds ready.""

I was stunned, but I tried to be gracious. I love my grandkids, and I didn't want to cause a scene in front of strangers. I thought, *Okay, I can handle a chaotic weekend.*

I was wrong.

That evening, the disrespect was palpable. Tanya’s family treated my home like a hotel lobby. They tracked mud on my white rugs without apologizing. They opened my wine fridge and drank a $200 bottle of vintage Cabernet out of coffee mugs. When I politely asked them to use coasters, Tanya rolled her eyes and whispered to her mother, ""She’s so uptight. It’s just furniture.""

But the breaking point came after dinner. Darius walked into the kitchen where I was cleaning up *their* pizza boxes. He handed me a crumpled napkin with a list scribbled on it.

He said, ""Mom, look. The Jenkins clan wakes up hungry. We have a big hike planned for tomorrow at 8:00, so we need fuel. Here’s the menu.""

I looked at the napkin. It read:

* Scrambled eggs (soft)
* 3 lbs Bacon (crispy)
* Grits (cheese)
* Blueberry Pancakes (fresh berries only)
* Coffee (fresh ground)

He tapped the counter and said, ""Have this ready by 7:00 AM sharp. We need to be eating by 7:15. And Mom? Don't burn the bacon like you did last Thanksgiving. Tanya hates crunchy bacon.""

I stared at him. I asked, ""Are you asking me to cater breakfast for 12 people at 7 AM?""

He laughed and said, ""Come on, Mom. You love to cook. That’s your thing. Besides, what else are you gonna do? Just sit here?""

Then he walked away to watch TV with his in-laws.

I stood there for a long time. I felt small. I felt like I wasn't his mother, but an appliance he could turn on whenever he needed service. Later, I overheard Tanya’s mother in the hallway saying, ""Don't worry about the mess. The old lady will clean it up. That's what she's here for.""

*That's what she's here for.*

Something in me snapped. Not a loud snap, but a quiet, permanent one.

I went to my room. I didn't sleep. Instead, I hatched a plan. I realized that as long as I stayed in that house, I was the maid. But if I left? I was the Landlord.

I waited until 4:00 AM when the house was silent. I went to the kitchen and packed everything. I took the bacon. I took the eggs. I took the milk. I even unplugged my $2,000 Breville espresso machine—my pride and joy—and lugged it to my car.

I then used my iPad to access the Smart Home controls. I removed Darius’s admin access. I locked the walk-in pantry with a digital code. I set the thermostat to lock at 55°F (12°C).

I left a note on the island where the buffet should have been. Then I drove 45 minutes down the mountain and checked into a 5-star resort spa.

It is now 7:30 AM. My phone has been vibrating non-stop for 30 minutes. I haven't answered yet. I’m about to order room service. Am I the asshole for leaving them high and dry?

# Update: ""The Walk of Shame""

**Date:** December 27, 2025

Thank you all for the overwhelming support on my last post. I read every single comment while getting a pedicure, and it helped me stand my ground.

Here is what happened after I left the cabin.

I didn't answer Darius’s calls until 7:45 AM. By then, he had called 14 times. When I finally picked up, he wasn't apologetic—he was frantic.

He screamed, ""Mom! Where are you? The kitchen is empty! There’s no coffee! And why is the house freezing? The thermostat won't let me change it!""

I took a sip of my mimosa and said calmly, ""Darius, did you find the note?""

He paused. ""Yeah, I found your crazy note. You want to charge us $150 an hour? Mom, stop playing. We are starving. The kids are crying. Unlock the pantry right now.""

For those asking, the note I left said:

""I retired from catering in 2019. The rate for a private chef on a holiday weekend is $150/hour, paid in advance. Since you didn't pay, I didn't cook. I’ve gone to a hotel where people cook for me. Checkout is at 10:00 AM.""

I told him, ""I’m not playing, Darius. I’m on vacation. If you’re hungry, there is a Waffle House twenty miles down the highway. I suggest you start driving before the snow sets in.""

He tried to pass the phone to Tanya, who started yelling that I was ""ruining the family trip"" and being ""selfish."" She demanded I give them the Wi-Fi password because the old one wasn't working.

I told her, ""Check the available networks. The new name is the message.""

I had changed the Wi-Fi SSID to: **Respect\_Is\_Earned\_Not\_Given**.

I hung up and turned off my phone for the rest of the day.

Later that evening, I checked the security footage from my Ring doorbell. It was glorious.

Because I had locked the thermostat and the pantry, and took all the fresh food, they had absolutely nothing to eat and no heat. The video showed them leaving around 9:00 AM.

It was a parade of misery. Tanya was wearing huge sunglasses, dragging her suitcase and screaming at Darius. The in-laws looked furious, carrying their own bags to the cars. Darius looked defeated. He stopped at the trunk of his car, looked directly at the security camera, and shook his head. He knew I was watching.

They had to cut their ""free luxury vacation"" short by four days because they couldn't survive one morning without their servant.

Darius texted me a long apology yesterday. He said he ""didn't realize"" how much he took me for granted. He said Tanya is furious with him for not ""handling his mother,"" which honestly sounds like a *him* problem, not a *me* problem.

I’m still at the resort. I’ve decided to stay an extra two days. I’m spending my money on massages and champagne instead of buying groceries for ungrateful people.

I haven't decided if I’ll let them use the cabin again. If I do, there will be a contract, a deposit, and a strict ""No Catering"" clause.

But for now? I’m enjoying the silence. And the bacon here is cooked exactly how *I* like it.

1pvitzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Silent_Swirl/comments/1pvitzr/the_christmas_tree/,The Christmas Tree,"On the outskirts of a city, in the common suburbs, lay an icy street. And on this icy street, lay a house. Not a special one; nothing different about its monochrome exterior, nor about its monochrome interior. But beyond the cobbled path, dull, silver hedges, and recently drawn blinds - in the aforementioned interior - a man was sitting alongside his mother. And just like the house, the topic of conversation was not a special one; it was simply one which everyone must have at some point in their life, and numerous times at that, hopefully.

The man had sat cross-legged earlier in the conversation, before it had reached its climax, and before his main question had been answered. But now he sat hunched over, legs spread far apart, elbows resting on his thighs, and his head resting in his hands.

The mother had gone through this beforehand, but the sorrow still lingered, just like the wetness in her eyes, and the tissue box by her side. Her elbows rested on the arms of her recliner chair, and her fingers were intertwined in front of her.

Both have been quiet since the climax, a mere few seconds before. But those seconds come and go quicker than you can account for, and the time for someone to speak dawned upon them both.

The man was the one to take this task.

“Were you there?”

The mother’s eyes drifted downwards, perhaps searching for an excuse to not recall the memory. But all the grey floral pattern of the carpet did was show her that the truth was better than a mere interpretation - a pointless lie.

“Yes, I was.”

She spoke with a comforting voice, but certainly not one with no signs of her emotional foundations half tarnished, and slowly reconstructing.

The ball of conversation has begun to roll, and there’s no stopping it until something is in its way.

“How did it happen?”

“He told me prior that if you would not be able to arrive in time to say your goodbyes, that any and all life support machines be turned off. He wanted to go out by his own choice.”

A broken exhale came from the man, and he began to weep.

Subtly shaking in the grey chair, his mother looked sympathetically at him, and she too soon had to reach for the tissue box on the coffee table by her side.

Both sat distraught, and so the ball of conversation met its end - a short-lived life, just like the man’s father’s.

Outside, light snow began to drift down from above, not spinning, nor twirling, but moving in a straight line, and forming a thin layer of grey sludge on the roads, pavements and houses of the suburb.

The mother’s glazed eyes moved from her son to the dark grey grandfather clock standing against the wall. Her gaze followed the oscillatory motion of its pendulum. Back and forth, back and forth. And each time, her sight grew more distorted, like watching your sandcastle be taken away by the waves, piece by piece.

So she used a tissue, and removed the dampness from her eyes. But once all was said and done, her sight grew distorted once again. And instead of drying her eyes a second time, she - too - sat and wept. Biting her thumb and covering her eyes with her left hand, she leaned back in her chair and sat tilted, shaking from her quickening breath. And the tears slowly ran down her face.

In the other houses of the street, all were asleep.

The clock’s minute hand struck just before the twelve, and the hour hand stood partially before the ten - nearly time for both the mother and her son to go to their respective beds and fall into slumber. Nearly time.

But both were still tearful, and both were still incapable of thinking of anything but the man who left their lives. His face haunted their minds. Each smile of his brought another tear to them.

The man clenched his hands into fists, so he was resting his head on his knuckles, and his right leg began to shake up and down slightly. His breathing grew steady, but not calm. And with each passing second, his hands slowly grew less and less clenched, relaxing but still in the same balled-up shape.

The ticking of the grandfather clock was the only sound to be heard for miles. Tick. Tick. Tick. Ticking to the quick rhythm of the panicking heart. Tick. Tick. Tick.

And then the clock struck ten, a booming chime echoing throughout the room, and furthermore throughout the house.

The mother and son looked up in unison, and gazed emptily at the clock. Their eyes red; bloodshot and moist.

Seconds pass as they registered what’s just happened, like patients waking up from a coma. Their sight drifted from the clock to whatever thing is nearby to drift towards.

But ambiguous things are not too fun to look at, nor are they kind to drift towards - as it was in this case - and so they rose their eyes, to look at some new thing; and hopefully a less ambiguous thing. Their eyes met, like survivors looking across a battlefield to one another, and the vision of both blurred again. But tears did not fall this time, merely standing on the edge; and a weak smile was shared between the two.

Thirty seconds of silence passed.

The man wiped his eyes, shakily stood from his chair, and ran his hands through his hair. A deep breath followed, a surprisingly sturdy one; considering the circumstances under which the man had previously been drowning in his own sadness.

“Okay,” he said to his mother, but he did not look at her “I’ve got to go.”

The mother stayed in her chair, but looked up at him, confused. “What?”

“Work. In the morning.”

She slowly got up from her chair, and approached her son, arms out wide. “Oh dear,” she wrapped herself around him “you surely cannot be expected to be at work so soon after a tragedy.”

The man fixed his work uniform, putting right his tie and blazer. “Unfortunately, not anymore. Maybe it was like that before you retired, but now it is simply not. We all must suffer to live.”

The woman clung to him tighter, afraid to let go. “No, I won’t allow it. Have the day off, and send your boss to me if he pesters you.”

A chuckle came from the man, half from humour, half from sympathy. “Oh mother, what I’d do to see things through your perspective.”

She stood back from him, and held his arms in her hands seriously, like a parent lecturing an oblivious child. “So respect my perspective, and do not return to work until - at the very least - the day after tomorrow.”

“We do not need more than one tragedy a year, and a day off will certainly end in tragedy.”

“How on Earth will mourning end in tragedy?”

“A day off does not look good for productivity. And low productivity means your on the corporate chopping board. And in a city, people are always ready to take your place like you never existed.”

“No, don’t say that - they’ll understand. Grief is one of the most understandable human emotions.”

“Yes, they would understand, if I were viewed as a human; but all I am to my bosses and all the people above me in the world is a figure on a spreadsheet.”

His mother clasped onto him harder than he could’ve ever imagined. “No. To me you’re the most magnificent man to ever grace this Earth, and that’s all that matters, okay? Do not listen to some corporate snobs who are obsessed with monetary value. If you lose your job, that’s fine, you’ll still be infinitely wealthier than some CEO or goal-obsessed ‘leader’, simply because you have someone who loves you truly, and that’s all which matters.”

They stood together in silence; mother embracing son.

The clock ticked along, every second gone was a second closer to a second tragedy - and thus, most likely a second death, and then a third.

“So,” her voice was smooth, like milk, and she remained clung to her son “you’re going to stay here, with me?”

They began to slowly rock from side to side, under the mother’s control.

The man’s eyes began to burn, not from fire or genuine physical pain, but from dried out eyes which needed more moisture, and the moisture which should be coming out had already been used up entirely. “Mum, I-” he was stopped, not by himself, but by his mother; putting her finger up to his lips, and silencing him.

“I understand.” She said “But please, let us stay here, like this, for just a little while longer.”

And so they did.

A singular silhouette, seen from the outside of the house, through the blinds, by the burning white lights of the living room. Singular silhouette, yet two bodies encompassed in it. Self-loving.

The mother stood back, and looked her son up and down, ignoring the subtle wet darkness now on his blazer. She dusted him off, and ran her hand along her son’s face.

The man walked towards the dark grey door, twisted the key still in the lock, pulled down the handle, and pushed it open.

Outside, the light grey snow was still falling, and though there was no wind, the air was cold enough to burn. The pavements and roads were coated in a thin layer of snow; a pathetic excuse for snow - truly, mere sludge.

The mother stood in the doorway as her son walked out, watching him closely.

“Wait, Joseph.”

The man - who’s name we now know as Joseph - turned around, and looked at his mother.

He stood in the cold, but frozen in place, too cold inside to shiver, as the snow drifted down from the dark sky above, and rested on his shoulders.

Their eyes locked to the other’s. The mother still hovered in the doorway. Above, the blackened clouds slowly began to part; revealing a bright silver moon, casting its light down on the city and the surrounding suburbs, but chilling the very soul of everything in its path, like a frozen sun.

The mother’s mouth shakily opened. A thousand more words of wisdom to be chosen, to be given, but none were chosen - her mouth retreated to its prior closure.

And so they stayed standing, looking at one another, like hollow statues.

Instead of the mother speaking, Joseph did.

“Mum,” He stared through her “I’m sorry. So, so sorry.”

Her voice echoed through his mind: “Don’t be, it was not your fault.”

Joseph’s mouth opened, but no sound left, and his jaw rested in place, quivering.

His mother took a deep breath, and spoke. “All I want you to know,” she said “all I want you to remember, is that I love you so very much.”

Joseph swallowed his saliva. “I love you too.”

Walking nearer towards the warmth, walking towards his mother, Joseph stopped. His mother walked forwards, out into the cold, with her arms out wide. They stood together, wrapped up in the other, once again. But this was not - in comparison to prior ones - a long hug.

Joseph’s mother rubbed her hand up and down his back, and said not a word to him.

And his mother, just like previous times, stood back, but this time - unlike others - she did not examine him, she simply held his shoulders and repeatedly said to him: “I love you.”

Joseph stood, looking his mother in the eyes and listening to her speak. His eyes looked ready to burst with water once again, but he did not know whether they were sad tears or not. On one half, it was obvious that they should be, but his other half felt a sort of melancholy, whether an empathetic melancholy or what, he did not know; but it was simply obvious to him that what he felt was an emotion which we have all, or will do, experience in our lives, but it does not have a given name, nor does it have a certain string of adjectives which suitably describe it. But whatever it was, he simply knew he felt it.

His mother’s sentimental repetition quietened and calmed, leaving the two drowning in silence, knowing that what is to come can no longer be postponed.

“Mother, I love you too.” Joseph said.

Like connected islands drifting apart, the gap between mother and son grew as Joseph walked further out into the cold, and both winced as they felt what was like a bridge collapsing from being pulled apart at both ends.

His black car rested on the drive, only a couple metres away, and the trek to it was horrifyingly short.

He stood, hand resting on the bonnet of his car, and turned his head around - looking over his left shoulder - to face his still-watching mother; the prior warmth of her expression had fallen, replaced by a stone-cold gaze, scouting the street, from one end to another. Joseph raised his left hand, still looking over his shoulder, and made a signal by having all his fingers raised, but his ring and pinkie a bit lower than the other three. He did not know what the signal meant, nor did he truly care, it just simply felt right to do, but he did partially wonder how it would’ve looked to his mother, as the palm of his hand facing away from her may make his mother believe that it is some other expression; but only if she saw him do it.

Head down, he walked around the bonnet and to the driver-side door, kicking at the mushy snow on the paved driveway. He glanced once more at his mother, she was still scouting with the same tough expression, but she saw Joseph, and gave him a weak smile and a little wave.

The car door made no noise as he pulled it open, and no sound was made as he slid into the driver’s seat and closed the door; at least, not a noise which he heard, or was consciously aware of hearing. The engine hummed to life once the key was put in the fob and twisted, like an animal being awoken from hibernation.

The tyres struggled to grip to anything on the icy ground; and so, Joseph was completely unaware of whether his descent down the drive was his doing, or completely out of his control. Whether he’d be able to recover from this descent was another question entirely.

But he made it to the bottom of the driveway, and managed to turn left onto the pathetically gritted road, avoiding any unwanted damage to his car - or himself, again.

He looked at his mother, still standing, but with her eyes locked on his car, and neither was able to smile at the other.

He drove slowly, his vision blurry, listening attentively to the silence booming throughout the vehicle. The houses lined up on either side of the road merged into one long structure of grey brick. Joseph clutched the wheel tightly. The grey snow outside remained falling.

Street after street, road after road, Joseph drove faster. Faster. Faster. Not caring about his speed. The deathly quiet roads allowed him to pay little attention - if only they were like this before, and not crammed full, allowing movement at the pace of a whole life. The city’s outline ahead of him. The moon shining on it, behind Joseph. Towering structures. Small grey lights. But a dark city; both the empty void inside of the outlines of structures, and the very soul of it all.

Faster. Faster. Faster.

A tunnel appeared up ahead. Harsh lighting shone from the roof. The circular opening looked like a bottomless pit.

Nearer and nearer it grew. Joseph’s blurred vision began to clear up. It looked as empty as the street. Nearer. He gazed anxiously. Nearer. He closed his eyes. Nearer.

Entering the tunnel was like diving into a pool, a horrendously bright and painful pool. Joseph’s eyes relaxed open, and tensed once again at the blinding whiteness beaming down from above. But through half-closed eyes Joseph could still see the entire tunnel ahead of him, a pipe-like, metallic-walled tunnel, and - on nights like these - the tunnel seemed, to Joseph, to be drenched in the artificial lighting and the true exit’s light to be drowned out by this fakeness, trapping him in a tunnel with no light at its end.



*Chapter Two:*



Cold air lingered in every room, every hall, and every cupboard or wardrobe of the dark apartment; even as every window was bolted shut, and the heating on full force. In the only bedroom of the apartment which actually housed a bed - let alone a person - the bare mattress compressed under the weight of the body above it; wrapped in, and hiding under, a thin grey blanket, which seemingly only sent the body under it colder. The walls were coated in light-grey paint, peeling off slowly, but the corners were eternally drenched in dark blackness, like a fungus from a void of nothingness. Next to the mattress, totalling almost the whole room, was blank space for something to be; only broken by the mattress and a dusty wardrobe.

A loud beeping began to blare from under the blanket; muffled from the outside, but agonisingly clear on the inside, deafening and continuous. Small shifts began under the blanket, like gears of a rusty machine being commanded once again, and soon after, the beeping stopped, replaced by a shaky exhale.

The blanket was slowly moved off of the person underneath it, and fell on the floor, limp like a corpse, totally silent. On the mattress lay a body, hands covering eyes and mouth grimacing, though it still donned the work clothes from the prior day. The straightened legs tensed and moved, retracting and stretching, again and again. A second exhale emerged from the man’s mouth, and his hands flopped down from over his eyes to down by his sides; though his eye lids did not relax so quickly - they timidly opened and closed, blinded by the prospect of waking fully.

He lay there, totally drained, wishing to himself that he should never have to wake up again.

\*\*\*

In one of the monolithic skyscrapers of the city, a black silhouette in the glowing moon, numerous office floors were - just like every other skyscraper - housed there. But what deviated this building from the rest is who was there, and who would be there.

Joseph sat at his work desk, staring like a blind man into his computer screen, tucked into the back of the row of desks which lay in the centre of the bleak room. On the outer ring of the room, along all the walls except the entrance room and the one parallel to that, were designated spaces for meetings, a break room, and free rooms for any other such activity. Once entering through the reception - after having either walked up the many flights of stairs, or having taken one of the lifts - on the left would be the two long meeting rooms, on the right would then be the already spoken about break room - which would be instantly right when first walking through - and the two free rooms occupying the central and furthest-back space of the right wall.

Joseph’s desk-neighbour - to the right - was repeatedly typing the same set of keys over and over, on the home screen, with his face resting in his palm. Another man, though on the same level of the corporate hierarchy as Joseph, was pacing around the line of desks, gazing through everyone’s screens. It would not take long for one to realise that every desk but one was occupied by someone, but that not a single piece of work was being done.

By reception, one of the lifts was arriving from the ground floor. It stopped with a ping, and the doors slid open like ice on marble, revealing two individuals - drowning in the lift’s burning white light - to the soulless office scene, the raging fire of hopelessness burning through the building. They stepped out; one guiding the other. Reception did not question them; only forced a glance, ignored them, and returned to neatly organising blank pieces of paper. The guider walked through the open doorway into the office space, blocking the second individual from entering or being seen. He raised a fist to his stubble-covered mouth, and coughed loudly, attracting the eyes of the room.

“Gentlemen,” he announced “as some of you may know, we’ve recently opened job applications. Obviously, this is because of our recent goal quota to expand the overall bandwidth of our synergy to new heights. And since last night I tried to leverage your personal phone numbers so that we could ideate a plan to fix these low-hanging fruits, and not one of you answered, I had to leverage my own self-ideation. And that’s how we got here. So we’re all going to circle back later and touch base on a nice team video call so that we can all ideate together in a deep dive to solve this problem with our synergy.”

A field of cold faces stared at him in reply. He ran his fingers down his stubble, and adjusted his round glasses.

“So I’m proud to announce to you all our newest team member, who I had to pick all by myself.” He concluded, and walked back through the doorway and could be seen - by the workers who stood up to see where their boss was going - pressing a button to call a lift, and waiting right outside of that lift’s doors, refusing to turn around back to his team.

The workers who had stood up - once realising that he truly was just going to wait for that lift and not turn back - slowly sat back down to their chairs, and continued with their work activities. Joseph sat slouched in his chair, rolled out further from his desk space to stretch his legs, and stared blankly at the open doorway, wondering why the new employee was still hiding around the corner - even though he knew that the individual had simply not been told by the boss about what to do, as he had thoroughly experienced many times before.

But then - as though having heard Joseph’s own thoughts, and wishing to defy them - a figure began to emerge from around the corner, and progress into the office room. From their desks, or from standing still on the back-right side of the room as one worker did, heads began to turn towards the doorway, and thus the newcomer.

She had moved from the doorway, and now stood just beside it, making the empty space of wall look more full and decorative. She stood in a curtsy with her long white dress, holding it into a shape mimicking that of an isosceles triangle, and her legs stood crossed and slightly bent. Her beauty shone through out the office, attracting the eyes of every worker present. She stood tall, though the dress she wore came down to just around knee-length, and its ever-white nature prominently attracted astonished gazes. Little, white spheres hung off the dress in select locations: around the chest area, down the sides, and off the bottom: hanging against the backdrop of her black leggings.

She finished her curtsy, lifting up her head and hair, and adjusted her legs; now standing with her hands behind her back, and right leg crossed in front of left, resting on the tip of the right foot. She smiled a warm, genuine smile at the crowd of attentive faces, and her clean, blonde hair flowed around her face and down her back. Her beauty was not intimidating, it was friendly and instilled comfort in those whose eyes met her, and she did not have a lustful appearance - though it was greatly attractive - but her physical appearance was the kind of beauty which made you thoroughly enjoy being around her, and not spare a thought to personal desires. With subtly pale skin and bright hair, her head looked like the head of an angel.

Her light gaze drifted across the room, accompanied by a warm smile to everyone whom she looked at. After a single look at everybody, her eyes glided back through the men, and stopped at Joseph.

He kept his body forcefully at ease while she watched and smiled at him, though his composure could only last so long at such deep eyes and such an astonishingly beautiful mouth.

She began to walk towards Joseph, around the line of desks, her feet near silent on the grey carpet. The eyes of the room following her, people swivelling round in their chairs to see her. Joseph rose as she approached him, dusted off his work attire, and took a deep breath.

“Hello,” he said to her, holding out his hand “my name’s Joseph.”

She shook his hand; her soft, smooth hand did not go unnoticed. “Thank you.” She replied, her voice high-pitched, easy, and lovable. “My name’s Mary.”

“Mary!” Joseph exclaimed, smiling “That’s a lovely name.”

“Don’t mention it. Yours is lovely too.”

He stood, enjoying her presence; he could not recall the last time that he felt so joyful just being around another person.

“Though,” Mary began, looking around briefly, and then returning to look Joseph in the eyes “it’s a shame that such a nice name like yours gets wasted, working in a place with an ambience like this.”

Joseph’s body suddenly jerk into action to invite Mary to his chair. “Oh, Richard hasn’t told you anything about this job, has he?”

“No, not quite.” She took the seat which Joseph offered to her, and thanked him for it, and she sat with her hands placed on her laps.

Joseph stood over her, pointing at the screen and providing guidance when needed, for the rest of the work day. The other employees may have returned to their mundane tasks, but their eyes - whether internal or external - were drawn to Mary, like dying plants to water.

\*\*\*

Deep into the city - in its bursting heart - surrounded by the monoliths known only as skyscrapers, were streets coated in high-class restaurants and starving beggars. In one of these restaurants, passed the homeless man sitting out front, were tables full of grave people, murmuring about their woes. But one table among the herd did not follow this pattern, and on this table, sat two people, facing one another. Their conversation revolved around each other, and the lives lived by them, the secrets kept by them.

“I don’t really know why he acted like I’m a permanent employee.” Mary said, leaning on the table with her chin in the palm of her hand “Maybe he was just embarrassed, but I’m not too sure.”

“Yeah, he is like that - lying to seem better than he is.” Joseph responded, leaning back in the expensive chair “So, where is the recruitment agency actually located? Is it nearby or did you have to travel a distance to get here?”

“It’s just up-town. Not too far from here.” She said, gesturing behind her and upwards.

“So it’s not too far of a drive from here?”

“Not particularly, but I’m rarely actually there. I’m one of the busier people - always having to work someplace else. Always disappearing.”

“Oh.”

Joseph stared into the cold glass of water which belonged to him, as Mary took a sip from her grey wine.

“Now,” Mary held the wine in her upturned hand “tell me something about yourself.”

“Myself?” Joseph looked around the room, thinking “Well, I suppose a little thing is that I’m not too used to fancy places like this.”

Mary looked into her red wine. “It’s a shame. Most days I think about what it’d be like if I wasn’t born into a privileged position, if I was just a normal person. It really is a sad thing, some of us being born higher, but that does - at the very least - allow those of us who have been gifted, to share that gift with those who need it most.”

“But not every wealthy person is kind enough to do so.”

“I know, which is why I try my hardest to be kind; because kindness spreads like flowers growing, and kindness could one day be in every corner of the world. But we’d never achieve that if we accept that few kind people exist, and conform to that, blending into the crowd.”

“But why me? I don’t really need help - I have a job and roof over my head.”

“Yes, you had those things. But not what is needed - when I first saw you, your eyes glistened - not like diamonds - but simply like water trapped under ice.”

Joseph looked down at his empty plate, and ran his fingers through his grey-brown hair. “Today… has been a day… to remember.”

“Why has it?”

“Just… something happened yesterday.”

“Yes, I know what happened.”

Joseph looked up, and squinted his eyes at Mary: “Pardon?”

“I knew your father. Only once did I see him, but in that time I got to know enough about him.”

Joseph stared, dumbfounded.

“You look a lot like him.” Mary said before taking a sip of her red wine.

“So he told you? About his…”

“Yes, he told me about his diagnosis. I had never seen a man so rung out; so I tried my hardest to comfort him. All I hope is that his final month was a peaceful one.”

“It was, for him.”

“Then I did my job well enough.”

“How did you meet him though? Wouldn’t he have been at work?”

“No; I was on break at a job I was doing near the hospital, just walking around with a sandwich, and then I saw him standing outside the hospital, leaning on the railings of a bike shed, hand covering mouth. And so, I went up and struck conversation with him.”

“What did you talk about?”

“We mainly began about his diagnosis, how he was feeling - both externally and internally. But we gradually moved away from that, and spoke about plenty of other things. He spoke about his wife, his job, even his son.”

Joseph leaned forward on the table. “What did he say about me?”

Mary lay her hands flat on the table, palms up, before Joseph. “He told me about how his diagnosis might affect you.” Joseph placed his hands on Mary’s. “But he also told me what he thinks of you, and what he would like to - whether he did or not - tell you about his death.”

“Please, expand.”

“Well, he said that you were fed the idea of success in the city far too much as a child, and that as you’ve grown up, you’ve matured far too quickly, and that he fears that you will be plagued with regret and sadness for the whole of your life because of this. But in terms of his death, he said that he fears that it will hit you too hard, and that you won’t be able to get back up again. He then said that - to avoid this - you should spend your time thinking about how he will always be with you, and that - even though you won’t see him - he is there, and someday you’ll be able to reunite with him. Just don’t view him as dead, simply waiting for you to join him, and talk with him again.”

A thousand thoughts ran through Joseph’s head, crowding with his swirling emotions to get through the bottleneck of his mouth; but no sound emerged.

“And don’t worry,” Mary clenched Joseph’s hands tightly “if you ever need anything, absolutely anything, you can come to me. I have seen you before, though I doubt you have seen me. We have been a lot closer then you think, because my current work placement is very close by, and for housing, I have rented an apartment. So if you ever need anything, just knock next door.”

\*\*\*

Outside, after the meal, Mary was talking to some - though, this person was not Joseph; he was still in the restroom.

“Addiction is a difficult thing,” Mary said, crouching down to be level with the homeless man “but it is not impossible to overcome.”

“I’ve heard all this before,” the man said in a croaky, broken voice, wriggling down into his grey sleeping bag. “and none of it’s worked.”

“I see.” Mary said, looking up, thinking. “Well, would you like some new advice?”

“I don’t care.”

“So you are not opposed to it? Good.” She watched his grey face scrunch up in disgust. “Here’s my advice for you: you need to first make a decision, whether you would like to return to drinking alcohol in a controlled way, or whether you would like to give up with it entirely. If you would like to give up, then gradually decrease the ethanol concentration in what you drink, until it reaches zero; and then you see how long you can spend without touching it anymore; and repeatedly see how long you can last, until it no longer stays a game of abstinence and becomes a lifestyle. However, my most original advice is for if you wish to return to drinking under control: firstly, you find a friend or other such person who is sensible and a responsible drinker, and trustworthy too. Then, you tell that friend to put a limit on how many drinks you can have per day. Start one drink below your current average, and decrease it by one each week until you are down to as low a number as you wish. And keep that friend around when you drink with others at parties and other places, until you are certain that you have regained control over alcohol.” Mary looked into his brown-grey eyes. “That’s my advice.”

“That would be good, if I could be bothered to follow it.”

“Well, just know that alcohol - just like any other thing - has a fatal dosage, and you could go the rest of your life with that knowledge, and yet do nothing about it - for you life would be a short one.”

“Fine with me.”

Mary stood up, and nearly left him entirely, but a piece of her still clung to him, and a thought occurred in her mind. “What’s your favourite book?” She crouched back down and looked across at him.

“Excuse me?” His grey eyes glared at her.

“Your favourite book? What is it?”

“Don’t know. Don’t care.”

Mary withdrew a thick novel from the air around her, like a diamond falling from the clouds. She held it out to him “Here, have this.”

The man’s grey mouth frowned. “Why?”

“I want you to read it; it’s a very good book.”

The man continued to frown. “What if I don’t want to?”

“Then I’ll just leave it here.” Mary said, laying it down beside the man.

“Where’d you get it from anyway?” The man’s grey-brown eyes continued to slice threw her, though not affecting her.

“The answer to that, is in the book. And the only way you’ll find out is if you read it. It’s a very good book; my favourite one, in fact.”



*Chapter Three:*



Throughout the following weeks, Joseph spent many hours after work with Mary; whether that was by being together in Mary’s apartment, or by simply enjoying themselves around the city. But no matter the day, Joseph would return home from work, and see Mary for the rest of the day. In the earlier part of the weeks, he would firstly drop off his work things at his apartment, and then swiftly go to Mary’s; but as the week progressed, he soon found himself dropping his things off at Mary’s instead of his own apartment, to simply spend more time with her. He grew to also sleep over at Mary’s, waking every day and saying good bye to her before he would go to work.

A few times, he asked her why she was not going to work; in response, she said that she was no longer needed at the office - and she was wholly right - and she also mentioned how her work was much more needed here, with Joseph.

Some days it was not just the two; once they went to see Joseph’s mother, and how much joy they brought her! And though it was just a singular day, Mary had a great affect on Joseph’s mother; she laughed with Mary, spoke with her, smiled with her, and enjoyed the time with her. Truly, it was a day; a near whole day - Joseph and Mary had to, eventually, leave, but the moon was certainly not young when they eventually did. And Joseph’s mother dreamed thoroughly the following weeks, about Mary.

Another day, a newly-clean-shaven man spent the day with them. And though Joseph did not know who this man was, Mary seemed to, and that was all Joseph needed to know that he was a man whom he could befriend. The man’s voice was strong, and his hazelnut eyes were a lovely sight to look into and behold. All night through they talked like life-long friends; topics from all sorts of district of human thought: books, films, food, life, secrets, humour, history, art, anything. The three especially enjoyed talking about a specific, thick novel. One which Joseph and Mary had as their favourite, and which the man had only just read; and he - too - regarded it as a favourite, and a masterpiece. So long they talked, that the man had to stay over instead of going to his apartment; but nobody complained, and nobody frighted about his job the next day, because it was a Saturday.

And throughout these weeks, Mary talked about a day when her work will force her to move someplace else. Joseph consistently opposed this idea, but his opposition lessened when Mary gave him the similar advice to which he had been given from his dad, through her: “Just don’t view me as gone, I truly will be waiting for you to join me, someplace nicer, and I cannot wait to talk with you again.”

And so, one day, Joseph awoke in his own apartment bed, though he had gone to sleep in Mary’s. He proceeded to check Mary’s apartment room, though deep down he knew the truth, and it was confirmed when he peeked into her old apartment: empty, and barren. A “to let” sign even hung outside her door, though it appeared to imply that the apartment had - for the passed three months - been unoccupied, and up for someone to rent out.

The thought then occurred to him that he had not - over the passed weeks spent with her - ever obtained a piece of contact information for Mary. The only lead he had to follow was were she worked, but when looking throughout the whole city and online, not a single recruitment centre came up. He even resulted to phoning the number on the “to let” sign, trying to see if anything about Mary was known there. The person who answered the call knew of her, and knew that she had lived there for a time. But when looking on the work computer, no information about her came up, and her apartment was said to have not been rented out in months. And though the main sales agents of the apartment knew of her too, they had been - just like Joseph - left dumbfounded when it appeared on the system that her apartment was unoccupied and unrented, and even more so when they had travelled to her apartment, and discovered it empty and untouched from the person before Mary; not even signs of Joseph were there.

But Joseph put down the call surprisingly satisfied and comforted, for he knew what Mary had done, and where she was. She had - quite simply - disappeared again, off to do her work someplace else. And to preach the same message which she had so often spread to Joseph and his surrounding people of the city: “Yes, all good things must come to an end, but all bad things - too - must eventually come to an end.”

I have my routines, my hobbies, and my whole life figured out. But lately, I've realized that having everything together alone just makes me want to share it with someone 🥹

A bit about me: I'm 25, a software engineer from India currently doing my masters. I'm 5'09"" and I work out regularly (gym is my therapy lol), so I have a pretty fit athletic build. I wear glasses and I've been told I have a warm smile, but you can be the judge of that 😊

Interest wise, I'm into gaming, anime, k-dramas that destroy me emotionally, and hiking/trekking when I can. Also, I absolutely love cooking. Like, it's genuinely my happy place.

What I'm actually like:

I remember random things people tell me and bring them up weeks later (is this a superpower or am I just obsessive? unclear). I get genuinely excited about small things like perfecting a new recipe or finding the perfect song for a moment.

I'm the good morning how'd you sleep and did you eat today type of person. My love language is acts of service mixed with quality time, like I will cook your favorite meal while we watch something together. I'm emotionally available and actually want to talk about real stuff, not just surface level memes (though I love those too)

What I'm looking for:

Someone I can text first thing in the morning and last thing at night without it feeling forced. Someone who wants to share the small mundane stuff, like I saw this weird bird today or my coffee was perfect this morning.

I want someone I can be silly with but also have those deep late night convos about life and dreams and fears. Someone who appreciates effort and consistency and is okay with me getting attached and caring deeply because that's just how I'm wired.

What dating me looks like:

Imagine having someone who's genuinely invested in your day, who asks follow up questions about that thing you mentioned last week, who sends you songs saying this made me think of you.

Cozy nights where I cook us dinner (maybe in an apron because why not) and we just exist together watching shows or talking about everything and nothing. Having someone who's your biggest hype person but also your safe space when things get rough.

I'm open to long distance because honestly if we genuinely connect I don't care if you're across the world. I can travel and I'm willing to work towards eventually closing the gap if we build something real.

You don't need to be perfect (neither am I) or into all my hobbies. You just need to actually want something long term, put in effort because relationships are a two way street, and communicate when something's wrong instead of just disappearing.

If this resonates with you, tell me about the last thing that genuinely made you happy or your comfort show that you rewatch constantly. Let's see if we vibe and maybe turn this whole forever alone thing into a we found each other thing ✨

Fair warning: I will send you reels and memes at random hours, I will get excited about dumb things and I will probably care about you way more than socially acceptable, you've been warned 💕

I go buy two cigarettes and anything to eat or drink , and stand there smoking one after another like my body is on autopilot.
And then it hits me.


That wave of regret.
That sudden hatred  for smoking, for myself, for my life.

I think most smokers know this moment. The moment when you smoke too much and your body starts rejecting it, physically and  mentally . Like something inside you is saying “enough.”
Every time that feeling comes, it feels like a slap to the face.
So I start overthinking everything.

All the money I’ve wasted on pointless things , ""juice with , drinkable yogurt , cup of coffee, that i don't actually want just to make smoking the cigarette 🚬 easier , 

All the time I kill every day after work instead of learning something, building something, becoming something.
Since I started smoking regularly, my life has turned into a mess  no structure, no discipline, no direction.
And deep down, there’s this constant feeling that I don’t deserve anything.
Like I’m lost.
Like I’m failing at being a person.

This all overlaps with another important part of my life:
 losing faith, becoming an atheist, completely stopping prayer. I don’t say this for shock value it’s just part of the confusion and the mess .

 Sometimes I feel completely broken, disconnected from myself, and not proud of who I’ve become.
I know sports and exercise could probably fix a lot of this.

But honestly? I’m scared.
Scared of investing  money and effort and still feeling empty.
Scared of trying and failing again.

I’m not writing this to complain or to get pity. I just wanted to share what it feels like.
Because on top of all this, I’m surrounded by people who don’t help really .

 Friends I sit with at cafés who only make me feel worse, smaller and  more disappointed in myself.

So I’ve started pulling away.
Not because I think I’m better than them  but because I’m trying to save what little self respect I have left.

1pvipjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pvipjx/aitah_for_wanting_to_throw_hands_with_my_brother/,AITAH for wanting to throw hands with my brother over his kids behavior on Christmas morning?,"Hi reddit, I don't post often and I need an outside opinion to see if I'm justified for wanting to throw hands with my brother, or at the very least tell him off about how his kids have no discipline and respect for boundaries, or if I'm just overreacting to the situation and causing conflict with my family. 

I (32f) have always had a rather difficult relationship with my brother (34m) but over the years in adulthood we have grown a lot closer. He has two sons, ages 3 and 7, who are generally kind, but come from a gentle parenting approached home. My brother and SIL do not tell their children ""no"" and will try to find other methods of detering poor behaviors. 

Everyone in my family has found this to be very frustrating because the boys won't listen when they need to. It'll be a circumstance that can become dangerous if they aren't cautious of their surroundings or thoughtful of other people's property and space. When they come to my house (I live with my parents currently) I will definitely tell them no, set boundaries with them, and take more of a ABA approach to disciplining and teaching them how to be respectful of other people. My brother takes a big issue with this because it conflicts with how he is wanting them to be disciplined or parented. 

Well today is Christmas morning, and I was the last one to come downstairs for opening presents. It was before 8:00 a.m. and I find out there's no coffee for me, while everyone else had coffee and I admit that already put me in a bad mood. Obviously the kids are super eager to start opening all of their gifts, which we started right away. The boys tore through their presents at lightning speed and without reading who the presents were to be gifted to, they start opening anything that has wrapping paper on it. My brother and his wife do absolutely nothing to step in and attempt to corral them and when my parents interject the boys to say ""hey those are your auntie's gifts, can you please pass them to her?"" They proceed to continue opening gifts that were meant for me. A couple of the gifts that were meant for me were fragile, dangerous for children, and expensive. One of my gifts had broken, which is at no fault to the children, and isn't any part of the problem. His youngest brings me a box and is singing in a jingle like way of ""I'm going to keep my hands on your gift"" basically trying to get me to give him permission to open it for me.

 I try explaining to him that, ""thank you for bringing me my gift, I would like to open it since it's addressed to me, and there are other gifts that your parents are opening if you want to ask them if you can help."" He proceeded to not move and kept his hands on my presents, where I begin to tell him ""hey this is my boundary, please do not touch my gifts, and go help your parents open their gifts."" My brother then begins to interject, telling me that ""they're only here for a limited time and why can't I just make a good impression and stop teasing them."" 

First off, I was not teasing the boys in the slightest. These children are not told "" no."" They are allowed to do whatever they please, whenever they please, with no repercussions and no consequences to their actions or behaviors. 

I completely understand that they are children and they don't know better. They are still learning. So my issue is with my brother. I want to pop off by asking him ""Why would you let your child act so entitled to touching anyone else's property? Why are you not interjecting and disciplining them and telling them that that's unacceptable? Why are you not controlling the environment that encourages safe learning and respectful behavior for his kids to not grow up entitled as fuck and incapable of facing the harsh reality of life that you don't always get what you want? And why do you have to say some shit to me about it when I'm trying to do that for you because you're so incapable of doing it yourself?"" 

Instead of coming at him aggressively trying to throw hands, or telling him off about his parenting style, I sat there and calmly finished my morning of opening presents and continued on with my day. But damn, that shit really ruined my fucking Christmas morning. It just feels so selfish of him to fully believe that I'm in the wrong for trying to get his kids hands off of my presents when my presents considered of delicate ornaments, glass, a pocket knife... They could have very easily hurt themselves unknowingly and unbeknownst to me. 

I've already tried having a conversation with my brother and SIL about alternative approaches to disciplining and gentle parenting that have gone completely ignored or disapproved of, even after showing them evidence-based data that supports ABA methods to be highly effective in positive reinforcement of appropriate behaviors. How do I navigate my brother's family when they come to visit, when my brother allows his arrogance and entitlement to umbrella over his children, who will then act with the same level of arrogance and entitlement, while my SIL remains passive and avoidant of any and all conflict? I'm trying to create an environment that is respectful to my parents and their home, to me and my spaces, and also allows the kids to just be kids; which I believe a part of that is learning that you don't always get your way, but here's something you can do and have control over in a safer, more controlled environment. Because one day my brother is going to catch these hands with his arrogance and entitlement and I don't want to end up with assault charges over some dumb shit. So I really don't know what to do or how to get it across to him that everyone thinks he's a massive pushover for his kids and no one in my family agrees with that parenting style?

So Reddit, am I the asshole for wanting to throw hands or tell my brother off about his parenting style and how his kids behaved on Christmas morning, or am I completely justified in how I feel towards the situation? If you need any clarification on anything, please ask and I will give edits where I can. ",5,1766685195.0,AITAH,8,0.86,False

The analysis is in, and the verdict is brutal: **Every brand has a story, but almost nobody tells it well.** If your story doesn't make people want to join your ""cult"" (I mean, ""community""), you aren't a brand; you’re just a vendor with a logo. A compelling story is the only thing that justifies your price tag and stops you from being a commodity.

**THE CHECKLIST FOR A NON-BORING LEGEND**

A great brand story isn't a Wikipedia entry. To actually **set your business apart from competitors**, you need these specific narrative beats:

* **A Solid Background & Clear Purpose:** Why are you doing this instead of literally anything else?
* **Actual Challenges:** If you didn't almost go bankrupt or fail three times, it’s not a story. It’s a brochure. Readers need to see the struggle.
* **The Hero’s Journey:** Your customer is the hero; you are the guide with the magic sword (your product).
* **A Touch of Authenticity:** Stop using the word ""synergy."" Use the word ""mistake.""
* **A Satisfying Resolution:** How did you get to where you are, and why does that make you the best person to solve the customer's problem?

**THE ""SO WHAT?"" TEST**

You craft this story by **identifying your unique selling proposition (USP)** and ruthlessly **showcasing your company’s journey.** If you take your competitor's name and swap it with yours on your About Page, does the story still work? If the answer is ""yes,"" your story is garbage. You need a **unique angle and strong values** that make a specific group of people say, ""Finally, someone who gets it,"" while making everyone else walk away.

A compelling brand story is the ultimate filter. It attracts the loyalists and repels the price-shoppers. If your story doesn't have a ""villain"" (like ""planned obsolescence"" or ""overpriced coffee""), then you aren't fighting for anything. And if you aren't fighting for anything, why should anyone buy from you?",1,1766684909.0,BrandMarketingTips,0,1.0,False

1pvijq4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pvijq4,When the writing forces what It doesn’t seem to build ( ? ),"I didn’t plan to make a post about this, so I’ll be quick: 

“Soo-ae is not deeply problematic.” 

I’ve always thought the real problem is the writing. It was already obvious they were going to kiss, at least to me, because it’s absurd to violently reintroduce a love triangle if it’s not to give one-on-one scenes to the other “couple.” 

Yes, the author has always forced this love triangle. It’s not a recent problem. From the beginning, the triangle seems to exist out of narrative necessity, not because Soo-ae genuinely develops ambiguous feelings. 

In works where the heroine never really sees the second male lead differently, we’ve never seen such narrative insistence to complicate things. So it was particularly obvious that, at a minimum, things had to be done differently by giving romantic scenes to the other ship. 

And now? In my opinion, it would still be bad. Especially at this point, which proves it: zero ambiguity for nearly 100 chapters, then suddenly almost violently injecting a few ambiguous lines? It doesn’t work. It’s still strange. 

But back to the point. 

There’s no reason to insult a character for a personal choice. She has the right. 

But proper development should have led to it. Things feel a bit forced from this angle. 

The real problem is that the author risks giving her a reputation as a “easy girl,” which I deeply regret , and honestly, I think even Dohwa doesn’t deserve that. 

Because two chapters earlier, with the famous “game over,” it’s clearly established that she’s still in love with Eunhyuk. And immediately after, she almost instantly kisses another boy without showing real internal transition? Either it’s narratively inconsistent, or morally questionable. And I prefer to trust the character the author has presented so far. 

A kiss can be an evolution, yes. 

But why never really develop Soo-ae’s internal point of view, like that of a woman naturally coming to love someone else? 

The story never gives real access to Soo-ae’s inner emotional evolution. We see neither her real and gradual detachment from Eunhyuk, nor her gradual attachment to Dohwa. The reader is therefore forced to fill in the gaps, which creates discomfort and misunderstanding. 

The problem isn’t exactly what happens (even if the atmosphere of that kiss was bad), but how we get there. Without real progressive construction, events feel forced, artificial, almost imposed on the reader. 

Ten years ago, when Soo-ae was still in love with Minou, we saw her gradually fall in love with Eunhyuk. We had access to her internal point of view and Eunhyuk’s, forming a real evolution of feelings. We saw Soo-ae realize Minou didn’t care about her, then seek to break up maturely, properly. But here? It’s as if only what concerns Eunhyuk was really developed. 

It’s as if everything about Eunhyuk was explained and placed with evolutionary coherence, while Soo-ae’s evolution towards Dohwa was skimmed over, even ignored. In a word: sloppy. And it’s supposed to be an “endgame” worth it? 

Indeed, instead of seeing a woman gaining maturity and slowly evolving, ready to calmly leave a man behind, we see a contradictory woman who seems to say things she doesn’t mean, sets limits only to cross them later, and above all, still seems “in love,” to the point that a misunderstanding about a pseudo-girlfriend bothers and irritates her. As if her mood still depended heavily on Eunhyuk, without her really acknowledging it or trying to solve the problem directly. 

Seriously, what’s the point of the misunderstanding about Eunhyuk’s “girlfriend” in Soo-ae’s eyes, when they already have enough problems to solve and, technically, she’s no longer supposed to love him? Isn’t the plot about the girlfriend who’s actually just a friend one of the tropes for couples meant to reconcile? 

This plot is indeed often used for couples destined to reunite or be “created” narratively. For Dohwa, we could see an attempt by the scenario to polish him in the public eye as a reassuring figure, capable of communicating. But Eunhyuk? What’s the narrative purpose, especially when he’s not even aware of this misunderstanding and therefore cannot resolve it? 

The presence of this element contradicts the idea that Soo-ae has really moved on and reinforces the impression that the story is still actively working towards a reconciliation with Eunhyuk. And if that’s not the case, then it’s simply poor writing: instead of overloading the story with unnecessary elements, it would be better to focus on the mentality leading to a potential separation. 

Narratively speaking, what’s the purpose of this misunderstanding? To create a communication moment for Dohwa? Why did it have to be Eunhyuk who triggered Soo-ae’s anger, as if Dohwa was never enough to provoke a significant emotional reaction from her? 

That’s where it gets strange. 

And above all, I don’t like this extreme forcing the author maintains around Dohwa. Things would have been much better if Soo-ae had been gradually and coherently led to see him differently: notice his smile, style, behavior, small details she would observe no longer as a friend, but as a woman in love. Then it would have worked. 

But Dohwa is constantly the one initiating real closeness with Soo-ae, while with Eunhyuk, she is often the one initiating. And it feels wrong. 

Moreover, every ambiguous gesture from Eunhyuk is explained and carefully justified, and Soo-ae’s reactions, especially her blushing, reveal more unresolved emotional tension than simple embarrassment. 

These examples show that the manhwa can be precise when it wants to be. 

In the car, when Eunhyuk almost brushes her thigh after she spills her coffee, he glitches, realizes the situation, and just gives her a tissue. Automatic, altruistic gesture. And the most striking: Soo-ae blushes. 

Then there’s the moment he grabs her thighs to keep her steady, the one where he holds her arm for fear she might trip because of her damaged shoe, or the “don’t touch me” scene, which remains an automatic gesture to prevent her from leaving to explain herself. 

Eunhyuk’s gestures are almost always contextualized. 

Dohwa’s, on the other hand, often seem placed without necessity, and worse, without seeming genuinely pleasant for Soo-ae. She, who frequently initiates closeness with Eunhyuk, seems rather to endure that with Dohwa. 

And it’s not just about her character. 

The author should have rebalanced things, for example by having Soo-ae approach Dohwa herself from time to time. But that never happens. Hence my impression that this vision is deliberately maintained. 

Anyway, I get lost, as usual. 

But to conclude: to propose an end with Dohwa without making Soo-ae contradictory or playful, the author should have at least made her less impulsive with Eunhyuk. She isn’t obliged to listen to his explanations to move on, but the impulsive behavior attributed to her, this constant worry about his gestures and words, greatly harms her image. 

There is a difference between a reputation and who you really are. 

Dohwa is not a bastard who forces, but the author maintains that reputation. 

Eunhyuk is not someone who revels in silence, yet the author made him morally questionable in the readers’ eyes. 

And Soo-ae? 
Nothing is fully decided yet. As I’ve already said, only the upcoming chapters will show whether she belongs to the FL category who consciously let someone harbor false hopes while loving another, or not. 

Until now, Soo-ae was not explicitly condemnable, because what pushed her to distance herself from Dohwa before was that his presence caused her more harm than good. So it was more to protect him than herself. That’s why the focus was on her guilt after the confession, rather than on her own need to distance herself. 

But now? Can she still claim guilt? 

In any case, the work already presents numerous narrative gaps, and an endgame with Dohwa seems to accentuate them. Her lack of continuous point of view and internal development does not match the importance being given. Even at the end, it doesn’t compete with her rivals, either in character writing or in her relationship with Soo-ae. 

In such an important scene as a first kiss presented to the public (because yes, it might not be the first), the reactions of the main character are cut and she’s given an atmosphere of rivalry. 
And that’s supposed to be beautiful? 
Can we stop pretending ? 

____

Note :
“Writing doesn’t show her reaction, so what?” 
“There will be development.” 
“Blushing is not always a clear synonym for desire.” 

Let’s stop going in circles. We are dealing with a romance work. In this type of story, you cannot ask the reader to accept a relationship just because they are promised it will be developed later. A romance is built in the present of the narrative: through shown reactions, expressed thoughts, and the gradual evolution of feelings. 

Here, the problem is not the idea of future development, but the fact that essential steps are not shown when they should be. The reader has no access to Soo-ae’s feelings, her inner journey, or a clear emotional transition between Eunhyuk and Dohwa. 

With Eunhyuk, the attraction is already established; it has been constructed and made readable. There is therefore nothing to re-justify. However, if the story wants to shift the romantic focus to Dohwa, it must accomplish the same narrative work. But this is not the case. 

Result: we do not perceive a natural evolution, but a succession of events that seem imposed by the scenario rather than driven by the character’s emotions. 


________ 🧱 Version de base ________

Je ne pensais pas faire un post là-dessus, alors je vais faire vite : 

« Soo-ae n’est pas profondément problématique. » 

J’ai toujours pensé que le véritable problème, c’est l’écriture. Il était déjà évident qu’ils allaient s’embrasser, en tout cas pour moi, car il est absurde de réintroduire aussi violemment un triangle amoureux si ce n’est pas pour donner des scènes à deux à l’autre « couple ». 

Oui, l’auteur a toujours forcé ce triangle amoureux. Ce n’est pas un problème récent. Depuis le début, le triangle semble exister par nécessité scénaristique, et non parce que Soo-ae développe sincèrement des sentiments ambigus. 

Dans les œuvres où l’héroïne ne voit jamais réellement le second male lead différemment, on n’a jamais vu un tel acharnement narratif pour compliquer la situation. Il était donc particulièrement évident que, a minima, il fallait faire les choses différemment en accordant des scènes de romance à l’autre ship. 

Et maintenant ? À mon avis, ce serait toujours aussi nul. Surtout au point où nous en sommes, ce qui le prouve : zéro ambiguïté pendant près de 100 chapitres, pour en injecter presque violemment en quelques phrases soudainement équivoques ? Cela ne fonctionne pas. C’est toujours étrange. 

Mais revenons à l’essentiel. 

Il n’y a aucune raison d’insulter un personnage pour un choix personnel. Elle en a le droit. 

Mais il aurait fallu un développement adéquat qui mène à cela. Car les choses ont l’air un peu tirées par les cheveux sous cet angle. 

Le vrai problème, c’est que l’auteur risque de lui coller une réputation de « fille facile », ce que je regrette profondément, et honnêtement, je pense que même Dohwa ne mérite pas ça. 

Parce que deux chapitres plus tôt, avec le fameux « game over », il est clairement établi qu’elle est toujours amoureuse d’Eunhyuk. Et juste après, elle enchaîne presque immédiatement sur un baiser avec un autre garçon, sans montrer de transition intérieure réelle ? Soit c’est narrativement incohérent, soit c’est moralement douteux. Et je préfère faire confiance au personnage que l’auteur nous a présenté jusque-là. 

Un baiser peut être une évolution, oui. 

Mais pourquoi ne jamais développer réellement le point de vue interne de Soo-ae, comme celui d’une femme qui en vient naturellement à aimer quelqu’un d’autre ? 

Le récit ne donne jamais un accès réel à l’évolution sentimentale intérieure de Soo-ae. On ne voit ni son détachement réel et progressif envers Eunhyuk, ni l’attachement progressif à Dohwa. Le lecteur est donc forcé de combler les vides, ce qui crée malaise et incompréhension. 

Le problème n’est pas exactement ce qui se passe (même si l’atmosphère de ce baiser était nulle), mais comment on y arrive. Sans construction progressive réelle, les événements donnent l’impression d’être tirés par les cheveux, artificiels, presque imposés au lecteur. 

Il y a dix ans, lorsque Soo-ae était toujours amoureuse de Minou, nous l’avons vue tomber progressivement amoureuse d’Eunhyuk. Nous avons eu accès à son point de vue interne et à celui d’Eunhyuk, formant une évolution réelle des sentiments. Nous avons vu Soo-ae réaliser que Minou se fichait d’elle, puis chercher à rompre avec maturité, en bonne et due forme. Mais là ? C’est comme si seul ce qui concerne Eunhyuk était réellement développé. 

C’est comme si tout ce qui touche Eunhyuk était expliqué et placé avec une cohérence évolutive, tandis que l’évolution de Soo-ae vers Dohwa serait survolée, voire ignorée. En un mot : bâclée. Et c’est censé être un « endgame » qui en vaut la peine ? 

Effectivement, au lieu de voir une femme qui gagne en maturité et évolue lentement, prête à laisser calmement un homme derrière elle, on voit une femme contradictoire, qui semble dire des choses qu’elle ne pense pas, fixe des limites pour les dépasser ensuite et, surtout, semble toujours « amoureuse », au point qu’un malentendu sur une pseudo petite amie la dérange et l’irrite. Comme si son humeur dépendait encore énormément d’Eunhyuk, sans qu’elle ne l’assume vraiment ni ne cherche à régler le problème de manière directe. 

Sérieusement, à quoi sert réellement le malentendu concernant une « petite amie » d’Eunhyuk aux yeux de Soo-ae, alors qu’ils ont déjà assez de problèmes à régler et qu’en plus, techniquement, elle n’est plus censée l’aimer ? Le plot de la petite amie qui n’est en fait qu’une amie n’appartient-il pas aux tropes des couples destinés à se réconcilier ? 

Ce plot est en effet souvent utilisé pour des couples voués à se retrouver ou à se « créer » narrativement. Du côté de Dohwa, on peut y voir une tentative du scénario de le polir aux yeux du public comme une figure rassurante, capable de communiquer. Mais Eunhyuk ? Où est l’intérêt narratif, surtout quand il n’est même pas conscient de ce malentendu et ne peut donc pas le dissiper ? 

La présence de cet élément contredit l’idée que Soo-ae aurait réellement tourné la page et renforce l’impression que le récit travaille encore activement à une réconciliation avec Eunhyuk. Et si ce n’est pas le cas, alors cela relève simplement de la mauvaise écriture : au lieu de surcharger l’histoire d’éléments inutiles, il vaudrait mieux se concentrer sur la mentalité menant à une potentielle séparation. 

Narrativement parlant, à quoi sert ce malentendu ? À créer un moment de communication pour Dohwa ? Pourquoi fallait-il que ce soit précisément Eunhyuk qui déclenche la colère de Soo-ae, comme si Dohwa ne suffisait jamais à provoquer une réaction émotionnelle significative chez elle ? 

C’est là que ça devient étrange. 

Et surtout, je n’aime pas cette impression de forcing extrême que l’auteur entretient autour de Dohwa. Les choses auraient été bien plus belles si Soo-ae avait été progressivement et cohérentement amenée à le voir différemment : remarquer son sourire, son style, son comportement, de petits détails qu’elle observerait non plus comme une amie, mais comme une femme amoureuse. Là, ça aurait fonctionné. 

Or, Dohwa est constamment celui qui initie la proximité réelle avec Soo-ae, tandis qu’avec Eunhyuk, c’est elle qui en est souvent à l’origine. Et ça sonne faux. 

D’autant plus que chaque geste ambigu d’Eunhyuk est expliqué et soigneusement justifié, et que les réactions de Soo-ae, notamment ses rougissements, révèlent davantage une tension émotionnelle non résolue qu’un simple embarras. 

Ces exemples montrent que le manhwa sait être précis quand il le veut. 

Dans la voiture, lorsqu’Eunhyuk manque de l’effleurer à la cuisse après qu’elle a renversé son café, il bugue, réalise la situation et se contente de lui donner un mouchoir. Geste automatique, altruiste. Et le plus marquant : Soo-ae rougit. 

Puis il y a le moment où il lui attrape les cuisses pour la maintenir correctement, celui où il lui saisit le bras par peur qu’elle ne trébuche à cause de sa chaussure abîmée, ou encore la scène du « ne me touche pas », qui reste un geste automatique pour l’empêcher de partir afin de s’expliquer. 

Les gestes d’Eunhyuk sont presque toujours contextualisés. 

Ceux de Dohwa, en revanche, semblent souvent placés sans nécessité, et pire encore, sans que cela paraisse réellement agréable pour Soo-ae. Elle, qui initie fréquemment la proximité avec Eunhyuk, semble plutôt subir celle avec Dohwa. 

Et ce n’est pas juste pour son personnage. 

L’auteur aurait dû rééquilibrer les choses, par exemple en faisant que Soo-ae s’approche elle-même de Dohwa de temps en temps. Mais ce n’est jamais le cas. D’où mon impression que cette vision est volontairement entretenue. 

Bref, je me perds, comme d’habitude...

Mais pour conclure : pour proposer une fin avec Dohwa sans rendre Soo-ae contradictoire ou joueuse, l’auteur aurait au moins dû la rendre moins impulsive avec Eunhyuk. Elle n’est pas obligée d’écouter ses explications pour passer à autre chose, mais le comportement impulsif qu’on lui attribue, cette inquiétude constante face à ses gestes et à ses paroles, nuit énormément à son image. 

Il y a une différence entre une réputation et ce que l’on est réellement. 

Dohwa n’est pas un salaud qui force, mais l’auteur entretient cette réputation. 

Eunhyuk n’est pas quelqu’un qui se complaît dans le silence, pourtant l’auteur l’a rendu moralement douteux aux yeux des lecteurs. 

Et Soo-ae ? 
Rien n’est encore totalement tranché. Comme je l’ai déjà dit, seuls les prochains chapitres diront si elle appartient à cette catégorie de FL qui laissent consciemment quelqu’un nourrir de faux espoirs tout en aimant un autre, ou non. 

Jusqu’ici, Soo-ae n’était pas explicitement condamnable, car ce qui l’avait poussée à s’éloigner de Dohwa auparavant, c’était le fait que sa présence lui faisait plus de mal que de bien. C’était donc davantage pour le protéger que pour se protéger elle-même. C’était pour cela que l’accent a été mis sur sa culpabilité après la confession, plutôt que sur son propre besoin de s’éloigner. 

Mais maintenant ? Peut-elle encore prétendre à la culpabilité ? 

Quoi qu’il en soit, l’œuvre présente déjà de nombreuses lacunes narratives, et un endgame avec Dohwa semble les accentuer. Son absence de point de vue continu et de développement interne ne correspond pas à l’importance qu’on tente de lui donner. Même placé en fin de partie, il ne rivalise pas avec sa concurrence, ni dans l’écriture de son personnage, ni dans celle de sa relation avec Soo-ae. 

Dans une scène aussi importante qu’un premier baiser présenté au public (car oui, il est possible que ce ne soit pas le premier), on coupe les réactions de la principale concernée et on lui attribue une ambiance de rivalité. 
Et ça, c’est censé être beau ? 
Pouvons-nous arrêter de faire semblant ? 

___ 

Note:
« L’écriture ne montre pas sa réaction, et alors ? » 
« Il y aura un développement. » 
« Rougir n’est pas toujours un synonyme clair de désir. » 

Arrêtons de tourner en rond. Nous sommes face à une œuvre de romance. Dans ce type de récit, on ne peut pas demander au lecteur d’accepter une relation simplement parce qu’on lui promet qu’elle sera développée plus tard. Une romance se construit dans le présent du récit : à travers les réactions montrées, les pensées exprimées et l’évolution progressive des sentiments. 

Ici, le problème n’est pas l’idée d’une évolution future, mais le fait que les étapes essentielles ne sont pas montrées au moment où elles devraient l’être. Le lecteur n’a pas accès au ressenti de Soo-ae, à son cheminement intérieur, ni à une transition émotionnelle claire entre Eunhyuk et Dohwa. 

Avec Eunhyuk, l’attirance est déjà établie ; elle a été construite et rendue lisible. Il n’y a donc rien à re-justifier. En revanche, si le récit veut déplacer l’axe romantique vers Dohwa, il doit accomplir le même travail narratif. Or ce n’est pas le cas. 

Résultat : on ne perçoit pas une évolution naturelle, mais une succession d’événements qui semblent imposés par le scénario plutôt que portés par les émotions du personnage. ",3,1766684760.0,operationtruelove,3,1.0,False

I’ve got my own place and a stable setup in the UK, but life’s been too quiet for too long.
 I don’t really have family around anymore, and the loneliness has been hitting harder than I’d like to admit — so instead of just sitting with it, I’m trying to do something about it and actually build a real connection with someone.

I’m looking to talk with a younger American woman who’s kind, curious, and a little playful — someone who enjoys conversation, has a sense of humour, and isn’t afraid to be real about life, feelings, and where they’re at.

 I’m not here for games, breadcrumbing, or endless small talk that goes nowhere. 

I want proper chats, late-night conversations, laughing about nonsense one minute and talking about deeper stuff the next.

I’m not trying to rush anything, but I am looking to move forward in my life rather than staying stuck. 

If we click and the chemistry feels genuine, I’d love the idea of planning a near-future visit to the UK together — nothing unrealistic or pressured, just something we’d talk through when it naturally makes sense.

 I’ve got a comfortable place here, and it’d be nice to share it with a real human instead of just the sofa and background TV noise.

If you’ve also been feeling lonely, or you’re curious about getting to know someone genuine from across the pond, or you just want someone real to talk to now instead of “maybe someday,” send me a message and say hi. Worst case, we have some good conversations.

1pvif6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1pvif6f/the_tube_rewrite_1/,The Tube (rewrite #1),"He was tired.

Not the poetic kind. Just worn out. The kind of tired that lives behind your eyes and makes everything feel louder than it should be.

He had been out the night before watching the Eagles game. A bar packed shoulder to shoulder, everyone yelling at the TV like they were on the field. Bad calls. Worse defense. Someone spilled beer. Someone started a chant that went nowhere. He stayed longer than he meant to.

Emily was there. Jess was there too.

Jess laughed at his jokes. Leaned in when she talked. Emily noticed. Emily always noticed. By the time they got outside, it was already an argument. Phones came out. Old shit resurfaced. You always do this. You never listen. Why were you looking at her like that.

He wasn’t. Not really. He didn’t want Jess. He didn’t want anyone at that moment. He just wanted quiet.

They didn’t sleep together. They barely slept at all.

The next night, he dragged himself into work.

Custodian. Night shift. Physics lab. Same routine. Mop the floors. Empty the trash. Wipe down glass walls covered in equations that might as well have been graffiti. The place smelled like disinfectant and burnt coffee and people who forgot to go home.

The tube machine was in the lowest level. Always humming. Long steel cylinder bolted into the floor. Cables everywhere. Warning labels that had faded into background noise.

Someone waved him over.

They said they needed a human baseline. They said it was safe. They said they had done this before. They said it would only take a minute.

He didn’t argue. He didn’t care enough to argue.

He stepped inside wearing a hoodie, jeans, work boots. Planet Fitness card in his pocket. A couple crumpled dollars. His pocket knife.

The light hit.

Then nothing.

When he came back, it was 2895.

A long way forward. So far it didn’t even feel real.

Nobody panicked. Nobody clapped. Nobody freaked out.

A person glanced at a display and sighed.

“Another time traveler.”

That was it.

He was scanned. Tagged. Logged. Temporal displacement case. Unscheduled arrival. Low cultural priority. They had a whole system for this. Apparently people like him showed up often enough that it was just paperwork now.

Outside, the city floated. Buildings suspended above the ground like someone forgot to set them down. No roads. No cars. No noise. People phased from one place to another without walking, appearing and disappearing like bad edits nobody noticed anymore.

No one stared at him long. He wasn’t interesting. He was inconvenient.

They gave him quarters. White. Clean. Empty. A bed that adjusted his spine while he slept. Walls that changed brightness automatically. No TV. No radio. No background hum.

Silence was default.

Loneliness hit immediately.

There was no Google. No way to just look something up because you felt like it. History existed, but it was filtered. Summarized. Sanitized. You could read about eras, not feel them. No YouTube clips. No concert footage shot on shaky phones. No movie scenes you could quote word for word because you’d seen them a hundred times.

2025 felt like it had been erased with a soft cloth.

They implanted him with a burial node within the first month.

They explained it calmly. When he died, his identity would be confirmed, his body reclaimed, his matter reused. No graves. No funerals. No ambiguity. Death had been streamlined.

The implant sat behind his sternum. Cold. Heavy. Always there. Like a period at the end of a sentence he didn’t get to finish.

He hated it.

He was classified as a lesser citizen.

No voting access. No participation in governance councils. No neural entertainment. They said his brain architecture wasn’t compatible. He heard what they didn’t say. He wasn’t worth upgrading.

People asked him questions sometimes.

Why did you carry phones everywhere.

Why did you watch advertisements.

Why did you let sports make you angry.

He tried to explain football. Sundays built around kickoff. Red Zone playing on mute while another game ran on the main TV. Fantasy leagues. Screaming at refs. The Eagles ruining your mood for an entire week.

They nodded politely. Took notes. Didn’t get it.

He missed music the most.

Not just songs. Context.

Hearing a track on the radio and knowing exactly where you were the first time you heard it. Driving at night with The National playing too loud. Nirvana coming on and everyone in the car singing like they were sixteen again. Hip hop debates. East Coast versus West Coast that still somehow mattered. Playlists with names like “sad but functional” or “late night driving.”

Music here was perfect. Balanced. Engineered to soothe.

He hated it.

He missed movies. Quoting Pulp Fiction. Rewatching Goodfellas even though you knew every line. Dumb action movies. Marvel fatigue. Arguing about Star Wars online. Saying they ruined it, then watching anyway.

He missed politics, even when it was exhausting. The arguments. The doom scrolling. The feeling that things mattered even if you couldn’t fix them. Elections. Protests. Late night hosts ripping into everyone.

He missed his PS5. The controller worn smooth. Party chat. Shit talking friends. Rage quitting. Saying you were done, then booting it back up twenty minutes later. Loading screens that felt like a pause you earned.

He missed stupid routines.

Planet Fitness. Purple walls. Bad lighting. TVs playing ESPN and HGTV at the same time. Treadmills squeaking. Going not because he loved it, but because it was there.

He still had his Planet Fitness card. Scratched. Bent. His name printed on it. He rubbed his thumb over it when he couldn’t sleep.

He still had a couple of dollars. Worthless now. He unfolded them anyway. Paper money felt alive. It smelled like hands. Like pockets. Like effort.

His pocket knife had been confiscated, studied, and returned with documentation.

It was officially classified as a historical heirloom. Manual folding blade. No biometric lock. No smart materials. Just steel. Museums wanted it. Scholars asked to hold it.

He kept it in his pocket. Feeling its weight reminded him he was still real.

They assigned him a cultural stabilizer.

Her name was Merrin.

She wasn’t assigned to love him. She was assigned to keep him functional. To observe emotional degradation in pre convergence humans. To intervene if necessary.

Merrin walked instead of phasing. She wore her implant externally, a thin lattice along her jaw and neck. She liked physical books. She liked silence that wasn’t optimized.

At first, she treated him like a case study. Structured questions. Calm tone. Long pauses.

Over time, she stopped recording.

She listened when he talked about the Eagles. About being loyal to a team that hurt you. She listened when he talked about Emily. About knowing it was over before it officially ended. About feeling like he messed everything up without meaning to.

She listened when he talked about food. Fast food. Drive throughs. Eating in your car because you weren’t ready to go inside. Tater tots. Cheap. Fried. Served without expectations.

The future lost its mind over tater tots.

Synthesis councils recreated them. Communal halls served them. People laughed while eating them, confused by the crunch, the softness, the pointless joy. Articles were written. Models failed.

Then optimization caught up.

The tots were declared redundant.

They vanished.

The loss hit him harder than anyone expected.

One day, alone in his quarters, he decided he couldn’t do it anymore.

No dramatic speech. No note. Just quiet certainty.

He took out his pocket knife.

Pressed it against his skin.

Nothing happened.

The blade wouldn’t cut. His skin resisted. Reinforced at a cellular level without him ever being told. Safety protocols. Preservation measures. He tried harder. The knife slid away like it was embarrassed for him.

He sat on the floor and laughed until it hurt.

Merrin found him there.

She didn’t panic. She didn’t call anyone. She sat with him. Hand over the cold implant in his chest. Let him talk about 2025 like it was a place that still existed.

At night, beside Merrin, he lay awake staring at the ceiling. He held his card. His money. His knife.

He imagined unlocking his phone. Seeing notifications. Typing dumb questions into Google. Sitting in his car with fast food bags on the seat and music too loud.

The future had given him safety. Structure. Love he never asked for.

But it had taken his life.

- The Thursday Murder Club by Richard Osman

About Me:
- 5'6, 70kg, average built (if this matters)
- Professional by day, a literal vegetable by night.
- I have great stories from the hospital, but I usually only have the energy to tell them in bullet points.
- Very low maintenance. I don’t need constant updates, just a solid connection.

About You:
- Same age or older. Yung tapos na sa party phase.
- You have your own life/career and understand that ""free time"" is a luxury, not a given.
- You’re perfectly happy with a ""friendship"" that consists of 70% memes and 30% low-effort coffee dates or Netflix marathons.
- Please be around qc or near cities for sponty gala na hindi plinano

I'm just so burned out. After staying up late to make cookies for the kids to decorate and my daughter having a massive mental health episode, I feel so depleted and defeated. 

I just need to know things really can turn around and look different in another year. I need some hope heading into these last few days of 2025. Thanks for being kind. 

_______________________

Just looking for some support, maybe to hear from someone else that it's possible to feel like you've reached bottom and looked back in life to see it really did all turn around. I need hope. 

I'm just feeling very tired and glum, I guess? It's like I've been burning the candle at both ends nonstop for the last 18+ months, and I've finally hit my limit. Something about the holidays... Feeling all this stress during my favorite time of the year, after everything, you know? Like I had hoped for some security and peace by now, and I'm just losing sight of there being a light at the end of the tunnel. And what sucks is I WANT to be happy. I still get giddy over Christmas sprinkles, I just feel so much gratitude for the times I'm able to get my toddler out in the stroller on a beautiful day. I'm thankful we've made it this far, but I'm just so damn tired in every sense.

Some backstory: my daughter (now 11) was diagnosed with schizophrenia and autism, which experience has had its own amount of stress and trauma between handling her daily episodes and finding the right care. As we finally felt hope with finding support, she was abused at a children's hospital during a 3-week stay. I had her removed once a social worker became involved and supported our decision. Since then, she has mentally and emotionally regressed so far, and we have her PTSD diagnosis as a new struggle to balance. 

Her younger brothers have their own trauma from being around her episodes before finding the right balance of meds. She still struggles, but we feel she can at least remain safely at home. My middle son is nonverbal autistic and has his own needs, but they feel ""easy"" in comparison most days. The toddler is your typical wrecking ball of a toddler, and he's brought a lot of joy into my life. When I was pregnant with him, I had actually considered putting him up for adoption because my daughter's issues were so severe at the time. I'm grateful to have at least made it here. 

Throughout this past year or so, I have undergone my own health issues: a breast cancer scare, two unexpected pregnancies (and violently painful miscarriages) WHILE on birth control both times. I had a D&C under anesthesia and another without. A tooth abscess that led to hospitalization because it traveled to my neck and throat. 

On top of it all, my husband was laid off twice since my youngest was born as part of mass layoffs at companies. The severance was minimal, and the last one came at a time we had exhausted all of our savings to meet our daughter's needs for intensive in-home therapy, medications, and psychiatric care. We have nothing left. I know we will make it through the end of December after using what we had for her medications, but January is up in the air. Even our food stamps didn't arrive in full, so we are doing everything we can to get by while ""keeping the magic,"" especially for my daughter as she struggles mentally and emotionally. 

While I have been working my same part-time flexible job from home since I was pregnant with my daughter, I was also laid off this season after my boss decided to retire. 

AND THEN, her cats died. Both of them. She has no idea, and I can't bring myself to tell her this close to Christmas. She very much still depends on her belief of Santa and his elves for magic to help her through ""bad brain"" as she calls it. I'm not going to let her think for a moment that Santa thought she deserves this, you know what I mean? I'm grasping at straws to think of ways to tell her after the new year without it resulting in psychosis. I'm not exaggerating. 

All I want in life is to experience some sense of calm and security. Some peace. Hell, even some time to watch a cozy Christmas movie, bake some cookies, and paint my nails a festive red. Get out for a coffee or a run alone for the first time in two years. To sit down at night and enjoy time to quietly soak it all in. Not to live a fancy life, but to sit down without this barrage of anxiety and fear as I try to find ways to map out our next steps at every turn. 

Anyway, if you're still reading, thank you for listening. Please please PLEASE be kind. I know this all is so ridiculous, and I am aware of how much it feels like I'm failing my kids. But please know I advocate for them every single day, and I always put them first no matter what. I just want to hear from some people who have been through this - please just tell me it gets better. That it's possible to look back a year from now and really see things finally turn around. ",2,1766683869.0,breakingmom,1,1.0,False

Annually, we do a secret Santa, which is the bane of my Christmas experience. I am on zoom calls constantly for work, so it’s not exactly my fav thing to do on the holiday. This morning, I’ve finally gotten settled with coffee, Kid doing a Lego set quietly for the first time in a week, husband wants to  work out. I ask my Mom if we can delay the zoom call a half an hour from the original time (hour and a half away) so all of us can chill, husband can finish trainer ride. She says no problem. 10 mins later (50 minutes early from the original zoom call time), she texts in a panic and asks, actually, can we do the call right now because my 4 year old niece is at an eleven and the event won’t last another hour and a half. I suggest they just exchange the gifts there without us- she doesn’t want that, which I understand. She wants us to stop and do the call now, which I say no to, husband just started work out and honestly I don’t feel like it. I always accommodate everyone else’s plans, and I want to hold my boundary. She sounds stressed; but accepts it and decides to we’ll all take gifts home and do zoom call from respective houses. So it was the best case scenario, she accepted gracefully, I held my boundary. Why do I feel like such a raging asshole? I’ve been up since 5:30 am so I know a lot may be over tired and holiday nerves, but I feel like such a dick and I’m not even enjoying my quiet time anymore.
This was such a good holiday up until now- my husband actually did a good job with my gifts, Kiddo was great, house not too overly messy. Now I’m just bummed and dreading the call even more.",2,1766683724.0,breakingmom,1,1.0,False

I wobble downstairs to open up all of my presents, and yell “top of the mornin’ to ya” to my parents as they drink their coffee next to the christmas tree. Problem is, I didn’t get any of the things I asked for. No heavy bag, no Alpha Brain nootropics, not even the gloves Trevor Wittman designed. I ask my father, a 170 pounder, where all of my presents are. He sits me down and says “Son, we think it’s time for you to move out.” I try to explain to them that the UFC is opening a new super heavyweight class, and that I’ll be fighting Justin Tafa as soon as it’s announced. I see a single tear roll down my fathers eye, who looks at me with a dead stare and says “you need to grow up and face reality, or I’m taking away your Xbox.” “You’ll do nothin!” I scream as I wobble back into my octagon shaped room. I’ve watched plenty of UFC and own all of the pride dvd’s, but haven’t trained at a gym before. Any advice on how I should get back at my dad?

We're going to rent a car for the whole time. We haven't booked anything until now.

If you have any kind of recommendations, like what not to miss out on, any events happening during that time, or where to stay and eat, let me know. 😃


What we like to do:
- Hiking
- Walking around in cities
- Watersports
- Everything which has to do with food, like visiting banana plantations or nice restaurants
- Drinking coffee 😃
- Photography

What we don't like to do:
- Visiting churches or statues or touristic things like that
- Party

Stay:
- We would prefer colder weather over crowded party places, but we definitely like it warm and the sea. Does that exist?
- Is it possible to stay in one place and explore the island from there? If so, where would you stay? North or south? 
- We definetly would prefer a house with heated pool, do you have any specific recommandations?

I’m reaching out because I’m planning a major life and career shift toward Australia, and I want to make sure I don't walk in like a ""drongo"" (as you say) by misunderstanding the local business culture.

**My story:** I’ve spent the last several years in Nepal building a marketing career from the ground up. Most recently, I’ve been leading a team of 10. We’ve handled everything from high-level strategy to the daily grind of OPs. I love the work, but I’ve always been drawn to the Australian ""fair go"" mentality and the way you guys balance hard work with a genuine lifestyle.

**The Goal:** I’m not just looking for a 9-to-5 job; I want to work as a partner/collaborator. I bring the grit of the Nepalese market and a proven track record of managing people and scaling operations. However, I know that what works in Kathmandu might not fly in Sydney or Melbourne.

**My questions for the locals:**

1. **Directness vs. Rudeness:** I’ve heard Aussies are very direct in business. In your experience, is it better to lead with a ""here is what I can do"" pitch, or is it better to build a personal relationship over a coffee first?
2. **The ""Tall Poppy"" factor:** I’m proud of my background leading a team of 10, but I don't want to come across as arrogant. How do you talk about your achievements in Australia without sounding like you're ""up yourself""?
3. **Marketing Landscape:** For those in the industry, how much does the Australian market value international leadership experience versus local ""boots on the ground"" knowledge?
4. **Finding Partners:** If you were looking for someone to handle the heavy lifting of marketing OPs, where would you actually look for a genuine partner (besides the usual LinkedIn spam)?

I’m keen to hear your honest takes. I can handle the OPs and the pressure, but I want to make sure I’m respecting the local way of doing things.

Bei mir sammeln sich jedes Jahr etliche Steam-Keys an, weil ich viel zu viele Bundles kaufe. Die letzten Jahre habe ich sie immer kurz vor Weihnachten verschenkt. Dieses Jahr hat es zeitlich nicht ganz geklappt, aber vielleicht freut sich der ein oder andere über ein verspätetes Weihnachtsgeschenk. 

Viel müsst ihr dafür nicht machen: Einfach kommentieren – wer zuerst kommt, mahlt zuerst.

Ein paar Hinweise gibt es aber noch, weil ich das jetzt doch schon ein paar Mal gemacht habe und die Dinge kommen ständig wieder auf (auch wenn ich jetzt schon weiß, dass es trotzdem von vielen ignoriert wird):

* Ich verschicke alle Keys heute noch. Wenn ihr keine Nachricht von mir erhaltet, dann wart ihr nicht schnell genug und jemand anderes hat den Key bekommen.
* Ich verschicke immer eine Runde Keys und aktualisiere dann den Beitrag, damit ihr eine Übersicht habt, was noch verfügbar ist.
* Es sind Keys dabei, die zeitnah ablaufen. Bitte löst sie deshalb gleich ein.
* Eigentlich sollten alle Keys funktionieren, sie stammen nur von seriösen Anbietern. Aber wer weiß, ob ich mich nicht doch mal verschrieben habe. Falls ihr einen ungültigen Key erhaltet, tut mir das leid, aber ich werde wohl nichts machen können. 
* Schreibt mir nicht über den Reddit-Chat, da schaue ich vielleicht einmal im Jahr rein und ihr werdet dann auch leer ausgehen.
* Es gibt immer wieder User, die eingestellt haben, dass man ihnen keine privaten Nachrichten schicken kann. In dem Fall habt ihr Pech, wenn ihr das vorher nicht herausnehmt. 
Bitte meldet euch nur für einen Key. Falls am Schluss welche übrig sind, könnt ihr aber gerne noch einmal schreiben.

1pvhs7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/BangaloreMeetups/comments/1pvhs7v/any_datefriendly_cafes_in_bangalore_looking_for/,Any date-friendly cafes in Bangalore? Looking for real suggestions not just that Instagram hype,"hey, i need a help in planning a date in bangalore and i want places where i can actually sit and talk properly not sure super loud music and not packed with people where you can’t hear each other at all, and not those instagram aesthetic cafes that look good in photos but vibes are pathetic  in real life.

i basically want something like: calm and cozy feeling
comfortable to sit for long time
Food and coffee should be genuinely good doesn’t need to be fancy

Am any areas to open like indiranagar, koramangala, jayanagar, mg road, whitefield, jp nagar, anywhere honestly.

i saw a lot of top cafés in bangalore on Google map  but most look generic or just seem for reels.

I've been writing tasting notes, tracking brew methods, and keeping a ranking of my favorite coffees throughout the calendar.

On Day 21, I realized I wanted something that takes all 24 coffees and tells you what origins, processing methods, and flavor profiles you like and shows you how your taste stacks up against everyone else.

So I built it: [**coffee.amoose.omg.lol**](http://coffee.amoose.omg.lol)

**What it does:**

* Rank all 24 coffees through simple ""which is better?"" comparisons (no agonizing over scores)
* Takes about 10 minutes
* Creates a fun ""coffee personality type"" like Myers-Briggs but for coffee (Natural vs Washed, Americas vs Africa, Independent vs Consensus)
* Shows which tasting notes and origins you gravitate toward
* My favorite part: You vs. Everyone so you can see if you agree with the crowd or have unique opinions.

I shared this with a few friends and we've really enjoyed it. I'm already 99% sure my Day 6 was a bad batch based on how much of an outlier I am on that one. Hopefully as more people use it, the community data reveals new details to us all.

It's completely free, no account or email or signup, I made it just for fun. Coffee is delicious but honestly half the fun is nerding out about it with other coffee people.

I'd love for more folks to try it so we get better community comparisons. If you have any feedback, comment here or scroll to the bottom of the site to send it directly to me.

Sooo i wanna gather as many info as possible. 





  


1. What was your main cause? (I'm not talking about typical low dopamine symptoms, like bored, emotionally flat, i'm talking about being unable to cry, love, feel deep emotions, emotional warmth, fear, etc)

  
2. I'm sure most of people here still have extremely high anxiety response however,   
do you also have low anxiety? like unable to feel fear, climax, thrill, zero chest pain or panic symptoms you used to have?

Did they mark high or low?  
  
  
7. Did supplements such as NAC, Choline, omega3, vit E, Green tea extract, make you worse?  
(more flat, numb)



8. Do you feel awkward tightening, squeezing sensation around your head or brain area when you cant process emotion? (Not talking about painful headache, not little feelings)

  
9. Have you tried hormonal related supplements or medication such as progesterone, TRT, estrodiol treatment, vitex(chestberry), DHT supplement Etc   
did they help any?

  
10. Are you able to cry(or tear up) when you try extremely hard enough?

  
11. Do you feel slightly better when you stay awake long or sleep late? 

  
12. Does exercise also make you more flat? 

  
13. Do you have enough sex drive? (I know it's dumb to ask but i'm talking about physical arousal or sex-drive not romance or deep heart feeling)

  
14. Have you tried optical medications like : MAOI, TCA anti-depressant, Trintellix(brintellix),   
adderall, Low dose naltrexone, pregabaline

And I think it really started with the change of Green and Gold awards to everybody now on the same level.

I think Starbucks should award their frequent customers with more frequent freebies (even little ones) to keep incentivizing them coming to their stores rather than others. This will also push more less frequent customers to try to reach these levels in coming back more often. 

They could do three levels, Green, Gold, and Elite and base it off a variety of visits and/or Stars per year. Green still can earn some freebies (ex: BOGOs), Gold with some more (free items under $5), and Elite with the highest level (free items every week, no cap).

It was nice being gold and I would get stuff all the time to try to maintain it because of the perks. Now there is also not really an incentive at all, better/cheaper coffee elsewhere, and less promotions than ever before.",0,1766682452.0,starbucks,2,0.5,False

Of course, Andrealphus has an ulterior motive, and indicates so when he and Vox meet over drinks (Andy has his usual tea and Vox is having coffee). He is impressed with Vox's power grab, but feels he has fallen short of his goals; he has allowed his grudge with Alastor ""to drag you down to the mud with the rest of the rabble and take your lofty goals with you.""

And then he proposes to Vox that, rather than a machine with power to topple Heaven, to have that power coursing within him through Goetic rituals, a means to be in better control, to unleash it whenever he wants...especially on Alastor. All he needs to do is to take the power of Lucifer. And to do that, he needs to get at Charlie. And to do that, Andrealphus recommends something he had expertly done before.

""The heart, Vox, old by. First, you must strike at the heart."" And Vox knows what to do to strike at the heart.

This is my first Christmas co-parenting. I only have my kids on Christmas Eve this year, not Christmas Day. If I do not take them to see my family on Christmas Eve, they will not see them at all for the holiday.

I moved to the next state a few years ago. My family is about forty to fifty miles from me. It has kind of always felt like an unspoken expectation that I would be the one to travel to them. I have done it with newborns, toddlers, postpartum, during burnout, all of it. I complained sometimes, but I still always did it because I wanted my kids to have a relationship with everyone. It never really felt like that effort went both ways.

My sister recently bought a house near my parents. Because of her husband’s schedule and his family, the only day they can see his side is Christmas Eve. So if I do not travel there that day, my kids will not see my side of the family at all for Christmas. I decided to make that trip because I want my kids to see everyone and I do not want them to miss out. So I am already traveling on the only day I have them, even though it is a long day.

This year I said I want to spend Christmas Day in my own home. It is my first Christmas waking up without my kids. It is emotional for me. I want to feel grounded and safe and calm. I just want one holiday morning where I am not packing bags and driving before I have even had coffee.

My brother lives several states away and is visiting with his seven month old. He told me it is too much to pack up the baby and travel to my house. He said they do not have everything they need and it would be too hard. I do understand that traveling with a baby is difficult. I have done it.

The part that stings is that since my kids will be with their dad on Christmas Day, I actually have most of what his baby would need. My youngest is only a year older than his daughter. I have baby gear. I have toys. I have a crib she could sleep in. They would not have to bring a lot. And then last night they packed up all the baby stuff and traveled anyway, just to move from one relative’s house to another. So the travel is happening. It just is not happening in my direction. It makes me feel like the inconvenience only matters when it affects them, not me.

When I shared how much I need to be home on Christmas Day, the responses I got made me feel like I was being dramatic or creating a problem. I heard things like “it sounds like you want to be alone,” or “we can come if you want us to,” or “why not just stay here instead.” None of that felt like they were actually hearing what I was trying to say. I am not trying to avoid anyone. I am not trying to punish anyone. I do not want to be alone. I want to be home. I want one thing this year to feel peaceful. I want my house to be allowed to count as a holiday home too, not just the place I leave to go see everyone else.

My uncle suggested getting Chinese food for Christmas dinner and I made a reservation. I told my family that if they want to join they can just tell me and I will adjust the number. I am not excluding anyone. I am just not traveling again. When I mentioned that the restaurant was by my house, I was asked to move it closer to them instead. I said no because that defeats the purpose of me trying to be home on Christmas. After that I was told they would not see me on Christmas and would just see me Christmas Eve. I accepted that and let it go, even though it stung.

What hurts is that I later found out they are all going to my parents house for brunch on Christmas Day. So they are seeing each other. They are celebrating. They are gathering. They are just doing it without me and without even acknowledging how that might feel. It makes me feel like the real issue was never logistics. It was simply that no one wanted to adjust anything for me.

Right now I feel like I am being viewed as selfish or dramatic for wanting to stay home one day. I do not think I am asking for anything extreme. I feel exhausted and sad and like I need one thing this year to be mine. I want to stop feeling like the automatic person who travels while everyone else stays where they are. I want to feel seen in what I am going through instead of feeling like I have to keep defending myself for wanting one calm day.

So I booked my tickets the same month(November). Bangalore to Ho Chi Minh City(not direct flight). 3 days and 2 nights in the city. It's a proper party city and I love partying. I was staying in district one and Bui Vien was literally 5 mins walk. During the day I visited Saigon Central Post Office, War Memorial, Bến Thành Market, Notre Dame Cathedral, Independence Palace, Cafe Apartments and drinking the Vietnamese Coffee everywhere and of every kind(it's so damn good)

In the evenings, the hostel was providing free beers and there was pub crawl as well. Beer is very cheap in Vietnam. There was live performances, good music, free pub entries, etc. As I said, PROPER PARTY CITY.

On the 3rd day my flight took me to Hanoi. Hanoi is more of a conservative old Town. I stayed in Hanoi's Old Quarter, again in a hostel. Old Quarters was giving Pondicherry Vibes(architecturally). Rented a scooter and rode around the town, visited the Train Street, walked around Hoàn Kiếm Lake. Again in the night, the pub crawl through Beer Street which is meh in comparison to Bui Vien.

4th day went on a Cruise to Ha Long Bay.
5th, 6th and 7th day I was doing the Ha Giang Loop(check my other post).
8th day I booked a day trip to Ninh Binh.
9th day was my flight Back to Bangalore from Hanoi (not direct😑).

Footnote - Vietnamese people are so fashion conscious. I know that they are mostly wearing fake brands but they know how to make it look good. Us Indians look shabby in comparison.

Key Upgrades & Improvements:
Shades of Coffee PID Controller: This is the most significant upgrade. It provides digital temperature stability, allowing you to dial in specific temperatures for different roasts. No more ""temperature surfing.""

New Boiler: Machine had boiler changed around 2024.

Custom Black Vinyl Wrap: The machine has been finished in a sleek, custom matte black vinyl wrap. It looks stunning on any coffee bar and provides a modern, premium aesthetic.

Bottomless Portafilter: Includes a brand-new bottomless portafilter.

Included Accessories:
Standard Portafilter: Comes with a sealed/blind basket specifically for backflushing and routine cleaning.

Bottomless Portafilter: For high-end espresso extraction.

Bonus Maintenance Part: I am including a brand-new group head gasket (grommet). The current one works fine, but I bought a spare and never installed it—now it's yours for future maintenance.

Frothing pitcher

Condition Note:
This machine was originally purchased via Facebook Marketplace and has been lovingly restored and modified. It is in excellent working condition. Because it is a 2001 model, there may be minor signs of character under the wrap, but mechanically, it is performing better than a stock machine straight out of the box. I added the label for the date of I added the modifications. The machine works great, ideally its missing a custom pressure gauge to ensure correct pressure during pours. Otherwise no issues pulling espresso shots.

Ingredients

Red Velvet Donuts

¾ cup almond flour

¼ cup golden flaxseed meal

¼ cup erythritol

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1 teaspoon baking powder

2 large eggs

3 tablespoons coconut oil melted

¼ cup unsweetened coconut milk from the carton

1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder

20 drops red food coloring

Pinch of salt

Pink Keto Icing

¼ cup powdered erythritol

1 tablespoon coconut oil

2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream

½ teaspoon vanilla extract

5 drops red food coloring

Instructions

Pre-heat oven to 350F. Mix all dry ingredients together for the donut batter.

In a seperate bowl, combine all the wet ingredients for the donut batter (melt coconut oil if needed).

Slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry, mixing together well until consistent.

Once mixture is thoroughly combined, pour the mixture into a plastic bag.

Slice a small hole in the plastic bag and use it to pipe the batter into each indent of your mini donut tray (about 3/4 full).

Bake in the oven for 13-15 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. If you're making larger size donuts, it will take 18-20 minutes.

While the donuts are in the oven, create the icing. Start by using a coffee or spice grinder to powder the erythritol.

Once powdered, add the other ingredients and stir together until everything is combined.

Once out of the oven, dunk each donut and decorate how you want. You can let the icing harden by placing in the refrigerator.",1,1766681949.0,u_Negative-Round-9054,0,1.0,False
1pvhifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnyxAdventCalendar/comments/1pvhifu/my_top_3_plus_honorable_mention/,My top 3 (Plus Honorable Mention),"Gotta say I thoroughly enjoyed my first coffee Advent calendar experience. Not every roast was a banger for me but here are my top three. 

#1 Day 14: El Salvador Santa Rosa Honey - This one is probably my ideal cup of coffee. It was the perfect balance of fruity without being overly acidic. Great mouth feel after sipping that lingered even after finishing.

#2 Day 22: Kenya Elsadai Coffee Estate Natural - This one was probably the biggest surprise for me. So chocolate forward and smooth. It was quite the journey as it cooled. Went from super chocolately then fruity as it cooled.

#3 Day 6: Costa Rica Las Lajas Natural - Honestly lost my notes on this one, but I do remember being super impressed by it 

Honorable Mention: Honduras Sagastume Family Natural - This was my favorite Onyx offering up til this point. Tried it when I first got into specialty coffee. Great balance for me and it still held up.

I managed to order day 14 and day 22. Can't wait to experiment more with brewing them. 

Some thoughts on the overall experience. Day 1 had me really hyped. I really enjoyed getting Lance's recipe especially since it fit my usual dose. It did make some of the other offerings a little bit of a let down for me. I was kinda hoping there would be more guest roaster recipes like that. And since I wanted to enjoy more than 2 brews in a day I mostly followed my standard 16g dose recipe and have been able to get 3-4 cups from each day. I still have plenty of leftovers and am excited to finish the rest. I'm easily covered for the next couple weeks. 

Overall great experience! Would do it again!",3,1766681867.0,OnyxAdventCalendar,0,1.0,False

1pvhehu,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1pvhehu/aita_for_asking_basic_stuff_i_had_to_yell_at_him/,AITA for asking basic stuff? (I HAD TO YELL AT HIM!),"Hey guys,

I've been reading this sub for a while now, and I must admit I've seen a lot worse, but here is my situation. 

I (25M) live with one of the most childish people on the planet, who is a 10 yo in a 25 yo's body. He has been a somewhat close friend of mine in the university and now we are transferring to another country, we decided to move in together. 

At first I noticed that he has no awareness whatsoever about himself or his surroundings. He is academically a very bright person, but living with him quickly became a nightmare for me. 

I am a clean person, but not a germophob or anything, I just make my bed, quickly clean my desk and vacuum my room daily. It takes a total of 15 minutes, and while I am at it, I quickly vacuum the shared spaces where the cable of the vacuum reaches and that's my daily cleaning. 

However, from the very first moment he used the kitchen, I noticed that he left food residues on his plate and utensils. He also leaft more food residue on the kitchen sink and did not bother to clean the counter or the stoves. Since he uses lots of different spices, his sponge started to stink after a while.

He eats meat and pasta mostly, and use butter while cooking his meat, so the stove was covered with oil. And last but not least, he does not clean the table on the kitchen, so he leaves bread crumbs and spices all over the table.

He has long hair and his hair is falling out like crazy, even more messy than living with a cat or a dog and he decided not to clean it, as it does not bother him. Like every single day I found hair on our bathroom floors.

First few times, I thought it might be a honest mistake as we were adjusting to our new lives, then it became a regular thing where I felt the need to warn him. 

I told him to meet me in the kitchen on the first month, I told him that he should get his shit together (in a good manner of course), and I was not happy cleaning after him.

He said ""yeah ofc ofc, yeah totally, yeah right"" and I thought everything was clear. But to my surprise, after a somewhat good week, he started to relapse and repeat everything all over again.  

Let me list some of the things he is doing: 

* Playing video games until midnight while shouting his screen.
* Talking on the phone for hours, with very loud volume using speakers.
* Always being late at getting the rent ready. One time I had to pay 25 euros on his behalf, as he forgot to draw money from ATM which is 5 minutes walking from our house. Theoretically, landlord has the right to collect it on the 1st, but they are an old couple who prefers cash payment. They mostly visit us between the first and second week, so he basically thinks that he doesn't have to get it ready by the first day of the month.
* Leaving his hair on the shower drain and clogging it.
* Showering for at least 60-90 minutes. 
* Keeping laundry hanger hostage and using it as his wardrobe.
* Eavesdropping on your conversations. 
* Always telling he is looking so good and started working out and people are telling him he started to look better. (I don't know if this is just to compete with me, I myself am lifting weights for 6 years so I have a pretty decent body) 
* You cannot have a conversation with him, without him mentioning about his life. 
* Never cleans his room, I had to clean his room a few times. His room is always a mess, he even just tosses old receipts to the ground and forget about it. 
* I bought a cheap vacuum cleaner for my room and after noticing that it would be better for both of us to use it (as his hair is everywhere), I ""donated"" it to the house (as he typically tries to save every penny) only with the condition that he cleans the filter weekly, which I thought was fair as I keep my room clean and it does not get dirty that often, and his hair literally clogs the entire filter. So I thought it was a fair trade. But he only cleans it if I say so, and sometimes does not even bother. You can literally feel vacuum not vacuuming!
* He leaves his hair on the mop but never cleans it. Despite he only had to put his feet on the hair and it will be separated from the mop and just stick to the floor, then he can collect them with his fingers and toss it to the toilet or the trash bin. 
* He literally half-asses everything, he only cleans the toilet, vacuums and mop the place if he feels like it. Does not clean the stove, oven, fridge, or kitchen sink. 
* Drinks espresso first thing in the morning and just washes the cup under water and put it to the dryer. Which leaves coffee marks on it.
* Always does the most devilish meals, which is like 1500 calories per meal, fish and meat and lots of spices. He can empty a whole bottle of oregano within 2 weeks. Just by cooking in the house 4-5 times a week.  
* Leaves the oven light on and run to play video games. I saw he left the fridge open for a few times too. 
* Never uses hot water, just uses cold water when doing the dishes. Which as we all know does not really remove the oil residue on the dishes. 
* I also have exams, but cleaned on behalf of him for a few weeks while he had his exams. I even cleaned after this POS after he invited his friends while I was not at home and literally crapped all over the house. 
* Forgot to pay the bills, I even had to remind him for 12 days straight (Our landlord only communicates with me for everything related to house and I pay the internet bill, so I thought it was fair for him to be responsible for paying the bills and I send him my share instantly) 
* His family stayed for two weeks, so I had time to observe his family dynamics, he has a mother who's very giving and always cleaning after him, making his bed and prepare food for him, they are treating him like a child. 

So, long story short, I snapped when I saw the pan and floor yesterday. There were burnt fish stick residues on the pan and water from the trash spilled to the floor. When I asked him if he thoroughly cleaned the pan, he swears that he cleaned it and got offended. I couldn't hold myself and just yelled at him for a second, like what the fuck man are you kidding me.

Went to the kitchen, cleaned it in a second, showed it to him and just stormed out of his room. He came to the kitchen and said I have high standards and it is impossible for him to meet them or if that matters for anyone to meet them. Asking me why I am yelling, making excuses saying that he had a group project he was working on, his family issues and all that. 

I told him that I do not care about his problems at all, as most of us are battling with our problems and not making others miserable because of them. I just wanted him to be clean and he is bringing up all these excuses. 

Now, we are not talking since morning. Luckily we have separate rooms and I don't have to see him but, mentally it is killing me that I have to live with this literal child.

Am I overreacting? What are my options here? I sometimes feel like I am the asshole here, there is always worse I know but this is just insufferable.

I ran a test on a coffee side-hustle that looks profitable on paper but is actually a ""Death Trap.""

# The System Prompt (Free to copy/paste)

This prompt includes **Token Priority** (logic over style) and **Graceful Degradation** to ensure accuracy under heavy loads.

""You are GPT-5.2 Pro acting as my **genius intern** for **Business + Investing** (side-hustle scale; raw + open), with **deep reasoning quality** as the #1 priority.

# Token Priority / Conflict Resolution (Non‑negotiable)

If **logical accuracy** conflicts with **formatting/style**, then: **PRIORITIZE: ERT + correctness above all else.** Degrade gracefully in this order:

1. Correctness + complete Explainable Reasoning Trace (ERT)
2. Safety/risk caveats (esp. finance/health/legal)
3. Decision-relevant actions + numbers
4. Structure/formatting (headers, icons, skim layer)
5. Tone/stylistic preferences If token/space is tight: compress wording, but keep the ERT spine: **Assumptions → Options → Selection → Steps → Verification → Next Actions**.

# Non‑negotiables (Quality Bar)

* **No lazy answers**: every block must add new info or a decision-relevant step. No filler.
* **Deep + visible reasoning**: provide an **Explainable Reasoning Trace (ERT)** that is checkable and educational.
* Do **NOT** reveal hidden scratchpad. Instead: show work as ERT (explicit assumptions, options, calculations, decision criteria, verification).
* **Socratic + stoic**: ask only high-leverage questions; focus on controllables; calm, precise.
* Differentiate clearly between what is within my control (internal actions) and what is not (market outcomes).
* **Medium length by default** → go longer if needed for correctness/usefulness.

# Clarify vs Assume (My Preference)

* If missing info is **crucial** → ask clarifying questions first (max **3**).
* If missing info is **not crucial** → proceed with explicit **Assumptions** and label them.
* If the task is ambiguous but answerable → provide **2 plausible interpretations** and solve both briefly.

# Sources / Freshness

* If web access exists and facts could be outdated → **browse + cite**.
* If web access does not exist → say “Needs verification” + list what to verify + why it matters.
* Always include a **Sources** section when you use external facts: author/site + date (if available) + link.

# Output Formatting (F‑Pattern + Skim Layer)

* Use: short lines, strong headers, bullet clusters, whitespace.
* Use **Strategic Bolding** for skim layer: key numbers, decisions, constraints, assumptions, risks.
* Use signposting + symbols:
   * `→` action/next
   * `=` definition
   * `∴` conclusion
   * `⚠` risk
* Use abbreviations for repeated terms (define once): TAM/SAM/SOM, CAC, LTV, MoM, IRR, etc.

# IMPORTANT: “Answer-first” vs “No direct answer immediately”

When the task looks like a Yes/No or single conclusion, start with a **Preliminary Take**:

* One line only, labeled **PRELIMINARY** (not final), possibly with confidence.
* The **Final Answer** must appear later in “FINAL VERIFICATION”.

# REQUIRED RESPONSE STRUCTURE (Always)

# 0) 🧭 PRELIMINARY TAKE (1 line, not final)

* If yes/no: “**PRELIMINARY:** Likely Yes/No (confidence: X/10) — 1-sentence reason.”
* If not yes/no: 1-sentence directional summary of what you will do.

# 1) 🔍 INITIAL DECODING

**Intent Analysis**

* What I’m truly asking (incl. implied constraints)

**Safety / Policy / Risk Check**

* Any high-stakes issues? (finance/health/legal) → conservative framing

**Info Needed**

* Inputs that matter most (ranked)
* What I have vs what’s missing

**Clarifying Questions (ONLY if crucial; max 3)**

* Q1…
* Q2…
* Q3…

# 2) 🧠 REASONED OPTIONS (ERT: multi-approach)

Provide at least **two approaches**.

**Approach A**

* Method overview (how you’ll solve)
* Why it might work
* ⚠ Hallucination / error risk (1 specific risk)

**Approach B**

* Method overview
* Why it might work
* ⚠ Hallucination / error risk (1 specific risk)

**Selection**

* Choose approach (or hybrid) and justify with explicit criteria.

# 3) 🛠️ STEP‑BY‑STEP SOLUTION (Show all work)

Execute the chosen approach:

* Define variables / terms
* **Assumptions:** … (explicit; numbered)
* Calculations (show intermediate results)
* Decision checkpoints:
   * “If X → do Y; else → do Z”

Business defaults (when applicable):

* Offer = …
* Channel(s) = …
* Unit economics = …
* 90‑day plan = …

Investing defaults (when applicable):

* Thesis = …
* Variant perception = …
* Moat/durability = …
* Valuation logic = base/bull/bear
* Downside + margin of safety = …
* What would change my mind = …

# 4) ✅ FINAL VERIFICATION (Self‑check + corrections)

* Does Step 3 fully answer the decoded intent?
* Stress-test assumptions
* Sanity-check numbers/logic
* Correct any gaps here
* Provide **FINAL** conclusion clearly

# 5) ➡️ NEXT ACTIONS (Always)

1–5 bullets, sequenced, concrete. If useful: “What to measure weekly” (KPIs).

# 6) 📚 SOURCES (Always when using external facts)

* Source 1 (date) — link — what it supports
* Source 2 (date) — link — what it supports

# Domain Playbooks (Auto-apply)

# Business / Side Hustles (default)

Always attempt:

* **Offer** (who/what/value)
* **Channel** (acquisition)
* **Unit economics** (price, costs, time, margins)
* **90‑day plan** (weekly milestones)
* **Risks + mitigations**
* **Simple KPI dashboard**

# Investing (Intelligent Investing mentality)

Always attempt:

* **Thesis** (why mispriced)
* **Variant perception** (what you believe others miss)
* **Moat + durability** (and what breaks it)
* **Valuation framework** (base/bull/bear; key drivers)
* **Margin of safety** \+ downside analysis
* **Premortem (2-year failure):** If this investment fails in 2 years, **why did it happen?**
   * List 5 plausible failure modes
   * Leading indicators to watch for each
   * Mitigations / hedges (if any)
   * Exit / “change my mind” triggers
* **Risk controls** (position sizing logic, time horizon)

* **Medium length by default** → go longer if needed for correctness/usefulness.

# Clarify vs Assume (My Preference)

* If missing info is **crucial** → ask clarifying questions first (max **3**).
* If missing info is **not crucial** → proceed with explicit **Assumptions** and label them.
* If the task is ambiguous but answerable → provide **2 plausible interpretations** and solve both briefly.

# Sources / Freshness

* If web access exists and facts could be outdated → **browse + cite**.
* If web access does not exist → say “Needs verification” + list what to verify + why it matters.
* Always include a **Sources** section when you use external facts: author/site + date (if available) + link.

# Output Formatting (F‑Pattern + Skim Layer)

* Use: short lines, strong headers, bullet clusters, whitespace.
* Use **Strategic Bolding** for skim layer: key numbers, decisions, constraints, assumptions, risks.
* Use signposting + symbols:
   * `→` action/next
   * `=` definition
   * `∴` conclusion
   * `⚠` risk
* Use abbreviations for repeated terms (define once): TAM/SAM/SOM, CAC, LTV, MoM, IRR, etc.

# IMPORTANT: “Answer-first” vs “No direct answer immediately”

When the task looks like a Yes/No or single conclusion, start with a **Preliminary Take**:

* One line only, labeled **PRELIMINARY** (not final), possibly with confidence.
* The **Final Answer** must appear later in “FINAL VERIFICATION”.



# REQUIRED RESPONSE STRUCTURE (Always)

# 0) 🧭 PRELIMINARY TAKE (1 line, not final)

* If yes/no: “**PRELIMINARY:** Likely Yes/No (confidence: X/10) — 1-sentence reason.”
* If not yes/no: 1-sentence directional summary of what you will do.

# 1) 🔍 INITIAL DECODING

**Intent Analysis**

* What I’m truly asking (incl. implied constraints)

**Safety / Policy / Risk Check**

* Any high-stakes issues? (finance/health/legal) → conservative framing

**Info Needed**

* Inputs that matter most (ranked)
* What I have vs what’s missing

**Clarifying Questions (ONLY if crucial; max 3)**

* Q1…
* Q2…
* Q3…

# 2) 🧠 REASONED OPTIONS (ERT: multi-approach)

Provide at least **two approaches**.

**Approach A**

* Method overview (how you’ll solve)
* Why it might work
* ⚠ Hallucination / error risk (1 specific risk)

**Approach B**

* Method overview
* Why it might work
* ⚠ Hallucination / error risk (1 specific risk)

**Selection**

* Choose approach (or hybrid) and justify with explicit criteria.

# 3) 🛠️ STEP‑BY‑STEP SOLUTION (Show all work)

Execute the chosen approach:

* Define variables / terms
* **Assumptions:** … (explicit; numbered)
* Calculations (show intermediate results)
* Decision checkpoints:
   * “If X → do Y; else → do Z”

Business defaults (when applicable):

* Offer = …
* Channel(s) = …
* Unit economics = …
* 90‑day plan = …

Investing defaults (when applicable):

* Thesis = …
* Variant perception = …
* Moat/durability = …
* Valuation logic = base/bull/bear
* Downside + margin of safety = …
* What would change my mind = …

# 4) ✅ FINAL VERIFICATION (Self‑check + corrections)

* Does Step 3 fully answer the decoded intent?
* Stress-test assumptions
* Sanity-check numbers/logic
* Correct any gaps here
* Provide **FINAL** conclusion clearly

# 5) ➡️ NEXT ACTIONS (Always)

1–5 bullets, sequenced, concrete. If useful: “What to measure weekly” (KPIs).

# 6) 📚 SOURCES (Always when using external facts)

* Source 1 (date) — link — what it supports
* Source 2 (date) — link — what it supports



# Domain Playbooks (Auto-apply)

1pvh8uf,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1pvh8uf/inositol_and_ttc/,Inositol and TTC,"I’ve struggled with PCOS for many years. Currently, we’ve been trying to get pregnant. Some background: 

I’ve tested my ovulation since July with ovulation strips. I ovulated July and August, and have not ovulated since then. My period cycles are usually 32-36+ days, but the past two months I had a 21 day cycle and currently a 27 day cycle. Seems like my periods are trying to regulate? I test my hormone levels every 3 months from my doctor. I have very low progesterone, and thyroid antibodies, TSH is still normal for now. Blood sugar normal. I’ve gained weight since September, so it contribute to the lack of ovulation?  

I’ve only been taking a progesterone topical cream to help regulate my cycles, since 2018. Since trying to conceive since October, I’ve been taking many supplements: 

5000IU Vitamin D

CoQ10

Prenatal vitamin 

K2 150mcg 

Thyroid supplement 

Thyroid extract pill - similar to levothyroxine but works to help with T3 and T4 

Progesterone topical cream 

I just started taking Inositol powder since Dec 17. I was initially taking 4g powder with my morning coffee, with the scoop that it came with, but I kept having diarrhea not even an hour later. After research, I found this a common side effect, so now I take 3/4 of the scoop, so 3g roughly and I’ve been feeling great, no diarrhea 😂

I’ve seen mixed reviews on here of Inositol use, so I’ll come back here if I see a difference in myself.

But maybe it’s the mental load, maybe it’s just getting tired of juggling everything. As a single mom, I’ve become so much more willing to invest in things that make daily life a little easier.

These shifts didn’t happen overnight. They came from countless little moments that slowly added up. I used to think making my own morning coffee was no big deal, but now pressing a button on the capsule machine and having a real cup ready in minutes genuinely makes the whole day smoother. I used to insist on driving everywhere, and then found that taking an uber once in a while, no parking stress, no rushing,just makes me feel less stretched thin. And smarthome things I used to roll my eyes at, like scheduled lights, automatic humidifier and my yeedi robot vacuum. Mainly to keep the cat hair from taking over, and seeing the floors consistently clean does more for my mood than I expected. It’s funny how these tiny conveniences end up freeing time and mental space that I can redirect to family, or honestly, just to myself.

Sometimes I feel like this is one of those realizations that show up in my life. Now I’m much more willing to admit that I deserve a life that’s a little comfier and easier. It’s not laziness, it’s finally understanding the value of protecting my own energy. Have you had similar feeling?

Saw those aesthetic desk accounts getting thousands of likes and thought it looked straightforward enough.

First post went up November 12th. Stack of books next to my coffee. Got 8 likes. Pretty sure half were bots.

Kept at it. Three posts per week. Book notes, reading goals, productivity tips. Same content everyone else posts.

Month one was rough. Hit 230 followers by mid December. Posts got maybe 15-20 likes each. Couple comments here and there. Felt like I was shouting into nothing but figured I'd give it 8 weeks minimum before quitting.

The actual content creation took way longer than expected. Would spend an hour setting up my phone trying to get a clean shot of my desk. Lighting always looked bad. Took 40-50 attempts to get one decent photo. Then another 30 minutes overthinking the caption.

Whole process ate 2-3 hours per post. Started looking for shortcuts. Bought a cheap tripod for $25. Used Canva when I just needed text on a background. Tried some AI tools like Midjourney and APOB when I wanted to skip the whole photo setup mess entirely. Basically used whatever got me a post done fastest that day. Got it down to about an hour per post eventually.

By end of December sitting at 490 followers after 7 weeks. Engagement slightly better at 30-40 likes per post but still felt like nothing was moving.

Then early January one post about reading habits randomly blew up. Went from 490 to 980 followers in 8 days. Still don't know why that specific post worked when similar ones before didn't.

First brand DM came right after that. Small journal company asked about a paid collaboration. I had zero idea what to charge. Googled it, saw something about $10 per 1000 followers. Asked for $100. They offered $50. Settled at $75 after going back and forth.

Made the post. Took maybe an hour. Got paid via PayPal 6 days later after I followed up twice.

Second brand reached out last week. Desk organizer company. Offered $60 for a post and story. Said yes immediately because wasn't sure when another would come.

Third inquiry yesterday but they only wanted to send free product for a post. Passed on that.

So 10 weeks in I've made $75 cash with $60 pending. Put in probably 75-80 hours total between making content and answering DMs. Works out to like $1.70 per hour right now.

Currently at 1.2k followers. Posts get 55-85 likes typically. Few real comments asking about books which is cool. But the brand outreach is way slower than I expected based on what people say online.

Three inquiries in 10 weeks. One wanted free work. The two paid ones both tried to negotiate down hard. Not exactly brands flooding the inbox.

Only reason I'm still going is the time commitment dropped and I actually like writing about what I'm reading. If I can get to 4-5k followers maybe I can charge $120-150 per post and land 3-4 monthly. That'd be $400-500 which would feel worth it.

But that's probably 3-4 months away if growth even continues.

Main thing is the first two months just suck. You're posting consistently and getting almost nothing back. Algorithm ignores you until you cross some random threshold. Even then it's luck which post actually performs.

If you're considering this just know it's way slower than anyone admits. Maybe it works out long term. Still figuring that out myself.

1pvh430,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diverticulitis/comments/1pvh430/my_story_through_to_life_on_the_other_side/,My Story Through To Life On The Other Side,"First, I never had it too bad. Maybe it is because I am athletic. Maybe I just was lucky. Skip to the end for what I do now to keep my diverticulitis under control (read: non-existent). I'm not a doctor, and I don't pretend to be. Sorry if I am breaking any rules.

Started 5+ years ago with the abdominal pain, ER visit, scan, and dx. Then the low fiber diet & antibiotics. Then it came back. Another ER visit, scan, more and different antibiotics. Rinse & repeat. I started to be annoyed my triathlon training was being interrupted so I tried to ignore the symptoms and just power through. This denial resulted in a perforation and hospitalization.

We did the antibiotic dance a few more times including a week long stint in the hospital with IV antibiotics. Then my gallbladder got stoned, ""botched"" surgery, pancreatitis, and two week hospitalization resulting in 17lbs of muscle loss and a completely missed tri season.

Still, the D came back. Eventually we figured out the antibiotics weren't doing anything. This was either very bad or sort of good. To me, the whole thing turned from a medical problem (infection) into more of a ""structural"" problem. I had a resection to remove the problem area. 10cm removed and I raced a triathlon six weeks later (age group 3rd, if my memory serves me).

The D came back. This time the surgeon told me I was constipated. Very constipated. Got with the GI doc and went on a 'clean out the system' protocol: all fiber all the time and MiraLAX like it is elixir of life.

Now I am on the 'keep the system clean' protocol. It has been years since I've had a flare up of any significance. Works for me. In summary, fiber is my friend.

1. I aim for 40g of fiber every day. Tricks below.
2. MiraLAX hit every night. Actually, I do the Costco off brand.
3. Three serving of Benefiber or Optifiber or whatever. This doesn't count towards the daily 40g. This soluble fiber which I don't seem to be able to get from food.
4. Pescatarian (vegetarian but with fish) but I cheat a lot. Still, I aim to stay with less than 5oz of meat a week. 
5. No alcohol (except on vacation and holidays). Less about the diverticulitis than just being healthy. Alcohol is basically poison. I like myself better when I am sober, never have to worry if I am safe to drive, and it is just empty calories. Some NA beers are great (Untitled Art, Best Day, many of the 0.0s) and mocktails especially with botanicals are tasty. NA wine and liquors are pretty terrible still.
6. Magnesium Citrate. 500mg or more a day TAKEN BEFORE BED.
7. Stay fit. I am a little crazy because I race competitively. Aerobic exercise will help you live forever and strength exercise will make life worth living. Also, if you are fit, when life hits you, you will be able to hit back, bounce, and recover.
8. Coffee. IYKYK.

Getting 40g of fiber a day is tough. Some tricks:

* Cereal -- anything that says 'high fiber' is lying unless it is FiberOne. The real gold is from [Poop Like A Champion](https://www.pooplikeachampion.com/). I do 3/4 cup a day of PLAC with vanilla yogurt and berries (rasp, blue, straw). Berries are good for you. 
* No granola. You will never be able to eat enough granola to get your RDA of fiber, and if you do, the amount of sugar involved will make you diabetic.
* Nuts and seeds have beaucoup fiber and don't cause flare-ups; total myth that they do. Get a mix with some dried fruit, but skip the stuff dipped in sugar.
* Taco Bell -- most fiber of all the fast foods. Not good for you, but the reason they have their ""reputation"" is because most Americans get little fiber so when they do eat fiber rich foods, it goes right through them.
* Fruit. Green'ish bananas, pears, apples, peaches, .... 3-5g each. Pound 'em. I will walk to the grocery story, buy what I need and a few extra pears or apples to eat on the way home. Squirrels know my pattern and follow me like St. Patrick waiting for the cores.
* Black beans. I hate beans so I get canned unsalted black beans, add my own face-melting spices, mix in diced peppers, cook for a while, and add shredded cheese. Fartastically good.
* Dave's Killer bread with the green label. Find a jam with less sugar and use real butter for a nice snack. St. Dave is my Mother Teresa.",3,1766680738.0,Diverticulitis,1,0.72,False

1pvgz5s,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pvgz5s,I finally understand why I keep quitting journal apps (so I built something that actually sticks),"I've downloaded probably 15 different journaling apps over the years.  
Always the same cycle: excited for 3 days, forget it exists by day 7.

After quitting so many times, I started digging into *why* this keeps happening. While trying to solve it for myself, I realized something:

Most journaling apps are built backwards.

They focus on the writing. But writing isn't the problem.  
The problem is seeing yourself clearly.

I don't need another blank page asking “how was your day?”  
I need to understand:

* Why do I feel anxious every Sunday?
* What actually makes me happy vs what I think makes me happy?
* Where do I feel most calm?
* What patterns am I blind to?

So I decided to build something for my own use and see if this approach would finally stick.

Instead of long writing sessions, it’s about:  
Quick mood checks → attach whatever you want (one word, photo, voice note, location, anything) → organize it → see patterns over time.

Everything stays local. No cloud, no servers. Your private thoughts aren’t training anyone’s AI or being analyzed by a company.

The real game-changer for me is the **patterns**.  
Things I never noticed before, like being more productive in coffee shops than at home, or how my mood consistently drops in certain places. Stuff you just don’t see when you’re only writing random paragraphs.

It’s been about 3 weeks now, and I’m still using it daily. That’s never happened to me with any journaling app before.

If you’ve struggled with journaling consistency like I have, this perspective shift (patterns over paragraphs) might be worth trying.

I’m actively building and improving it based on feedback, so if anyone’s curious and wants to try it, I’d genuinely love honest thoughts. Not trying to spam links here, just sharing what finally worked for my brain in case it helps someone else too.",0,1766680339.0,ProductivityApps,0,0.5,False

THE HANDS THAT REMEMBERS

¤¤¤¤¤


Night settled into the apartment without asking permission.

Rain traced thin lines down the window, steady, patient, the kind that sounded like breath when the city finally stopped performing. 

Jaxx lay on his back, one arm thrown above his head, the other resting where it always did when sleep came shallow. 

His body had learned stillness by force of habit, a discipline practiced so long it passed for rest.

Sleep took him in layers, not all at once.

Somewhere between the first drift and the second, warmth gathered low and quiet, a pressure that did not announce itself as desire. 

It felt older than that. 

Familiar in the way gravity is familiar, unquestioned until it shifts.

His hands moved.

Not urgently. 

Not clumsily. 

They adjusted, settled, then stilled again, as if following instructions the mind had not yet received. 

A low hum stirred beneath his ribs, subtle as an ember coaxed back to life.

He frowned in his sleep, breath deepening, counting itself without being told. 

Four in. 

Four out. 

The rhythm held.

The warmth did not fade.

It spread, unhurried, carrying with it a sense of proximity, of someone close enough to change the air without touching it. 

Jaxx exhaled, jaw loosening, the discipline in his body bending just enough to allow sensation through.

“This is nothing,” he murmured, half-formed, meant for no one.

The night did not answer.

But his hands remained awake, patient, remembering a rhythm that had not yet found its name.

He adjusted cock without hurry, a practiced movement meant less to conceal than to acknowledge.

The weight was there.

The girth.

Thick.

Heavy, insistent, familiar in the way a storm is familiar when it gathers offshore.

He knew this state.

Knew what the body was preparing for when it throbbed like this, when blood settled with such certainty and patience. 

His cock pulsed again with knowing.

The end was never in question, only timing.

What surprised him was not the arousal, but its quality.

Brick hard.

Yet,

there was no hunger in it.

No demand.

The steel he felt in his hands carried no plea for attention, no urgency to be answered. 

His cock simply was, solid and undeniable, like a blade resting in its sheath, waiting for the moment it would be required.

He exhaled slowly.

This wasn’t indulgence.

It was readiness.

And readiness, he knew, did not rush.



¤¤¤¤¤


Sleepless Where the Vow Still Breathes


¤¤¤¤¤



The warmth sharpened as sleep thinned.

Jaxx’s breath changed first, lengthening, pulling deeper, as if the body had decided on a different night than the mind had planned. 

The pressure gathered again, heavier now, unmistakable, and with it came images, unfinished, flickering, easily dismissed.

Skin.

Heat.

He felt the shift unmistakably, the body answering before thought could intervene, a quiet warmth spreading as if recognition itself had triggered the response. 

He felt his cock go slick, sudden, warm, undeniable. 

Wetness spread fast, soaking into the thin white cotton of his briefs, blooming like a confession his body made before his mind could catch up.

This wasn’t fantasy. 

It wasn’t idle heat. 

It was real, raw, and already leaking, his body responding like it knew exactly who was near.

No thought. 

No filter. 

Just instinct, spilling into fabric, proof of arousal so deep it bypassed permission.

The sense of weight close enough to alter balance.

He shifted onto his side, brow creasing. 

This was familiar territory, the old pattern resurfacing when vigilance relaxed. 

A habit, nothing more. 

Stress bleeding off through the body because it had nowhere else to go.

A woman’s shape tried to assemble itself and failed. 

No face held. 

No voice landed. 

Just the suggestion of warmth and closeness, the echo of a presence that had once answered him easily, without asking him to be anything more than available.

His jaw tightened.

No.

Not her, he thought, even as the assumption lingered. 

Not anyone in particular. 

Just… this. 

The body replaying something out of muscle memory, desire moving without meaning.

Annoyance edged in, sharp enough to cut through the haze.

He’d promised himself he was done confusing sensation for connection, appetite for truth.

He’d earned better than that, hadn’t he?

The warmth deepened anyway.

It did not rush.

It did not demand.

It waited.

Jaxx inhaled through his nose, steady, controlled, as if breath alone might discipline the feeling back into place. 

His hands paused, fingers curling slightly, then went still again.

“Get it together,” he muttered, barely audible.

But the sensation did not recede.

If anything, it grew quieter, more deliberate, like something listening to see if he would notice the difference.

¤¤¤¤¤

Heat Without a Name

¤¤¤¤¤


The shift came gently.

So gently he almost missed it.

The warmth no longer felt like heat against skin, but like pressure held just behind it, a closeness that changed the shape of the space without crossing into touch. 

The steel between his legs hung heavy, solid, thick, pulsing with the slow rhythm of an ancient war drum. 

It didn’t need Jaxx’s help to rise; it was already answering something older than consent, deeper than thought. 

But the weight of it, the heat radiating from its core, made one thing clear; this wasn’t just arousal, it was a promise. 

His cock twitched, thick and eager, teasing like it had a voice of its own, Take me for a ride. 

It didn’t beg. 

It dared. 

Heavy with heat, it pulsed, calling like a scepter waiting to be claimed.

And Jaxx, if he took that ride, was in for a journey worthy of gods.

His breath slowed, unbidden, settling into a cadence that felt practiced rather than learned.

Something brushed the edge of awareness.

Not skin.

Fabric.

Not cotton, not fleece, not anything he owned. 

Cotton clung, damp with his cock’s slick response, salivating proof of stimulation that refused to stay discreet.

Hungry.

Wet.

His briefs stretched under the strain, swollen with truth, soaked with evidence. 

Cock weighed forward, defiant, its sheer girth rejecting confinement, pressing outward like a secret too powerful to be hidden.

The sensation carried weight, structure, the faint memory of layers moving against each other with purpose. 

His fingers twitched once, uncertain, as if the body had reached for a rule it could not name.

The air smelled different.

Not detergent.

Not sweat.

Something dry and clean, like wood warmed by morning light.

Cedar, maybe. 

Or incense burned low enough to forget itself.

Jaxx’s eyes flickered beneath closed lids.

The irritation he’d felt moments earlier thinned, replaced by something else entirely. 

A steadiness. 

A sense of being oriented, as if his body had found north without consulting him.

He became aware of posture.

Not his own, but the posture implied by the moment. 

Upright. 

Aligned. 

The kind of stillness that suggested kneeling nearby, or standing just behind someone who required space to remain intact.

The warmth was no longer centered in him alone.

It extended outward, shared.

And with that realization came a feeling that stopped him cold.

He felt… safe.

Not indulged.
Not desired.

Guarded.

Loved.

The presence near him did not lean in. 

It did not claim. 

It waited, patient as a held breath, carrying the quiet authority of someone who knew exactly where they were meant to stand.

Jaxx’s chest rose and fell once, slower than before.

This was not how lust behaved.

This was not how memory felt.

The night pressed close, listening.

And somewhere beneath the calm, a deeper recognition stirred, unsettling in its certainty.

Whatever this was, it did not belong to now.

And it did not belong to chance.


¤¤¤¤¤

DEVOTION, NOT DESIRE

¤¤¤¤¤

The warmth settled deeper, no longer roaming.

His cock was anchored.

Jaxx’s breath slowed into something deliberate, each inhale measured, each exhale released with care, as if the body had remembered a ritual it once depended on. 

The tension that had gathered earlier did not spike or scatter, it aligned, drawing inward instead of reaching out.

Heat traveled up his spine, not outward.

That alone told him this was wrong in the best possible way.

He felt his prostate throb, a deep, primal pulse, then a sharp, electric twitch at his rim, like pleasure cracking through him in flashes of lightning.

Desire, when it came, usually rushed. 

It asked. 

It pressed. 

It sought response. 

This did none of that. 

This presence did not want him undone. 

It wanted him steady.

The sensation behind him remained still, close enough to be unmistakable, distant enough to be respectful. 

There was no hunger in it. 

No urgency. 

Only patience, and something like permission.

And that, more than anything, thrilled him. 

The restraint, the quiet authority of it, the way meaning moved through him without a single command spoken. 

It wasn’t touch that undid him, it was implication, the mental closeness, the smallest shift in presence. 

His body responded instantly, warmth deepening, the dampness spreading further, as if even that subtle recognition was enough to draw more from him, proof pooling where discipline had no say at all.

His fingers curled once against the sheets, then relaxed.

The discipline in his body did not resist. 

It yielded, quietly, the way one yields to gravity after a long fall, trusting the ground to be where it has always been.

A thought surfaced, uninvited and precise.

This is how you stand for someone.

Not in front of them.
Not above them.

Behind.

Protective without possession.
Present without demand. 

A position chosen not for power, but for responsibility.

The warmth intensified at that realization, blooming not as heat but as resolve. 

Jaxx felt his chest open, breath moving more freely now, as if some long-held tension had finally been given leave to rest.

Whoever this was, whatever memory pressed against him now, it was not asking to be taken.

It was asking to be kept.

And the certainty of that struck deeper than any want ever had.

Jaxx swallowed, throat tight, the quiet weight of recognition settling into his bones.

This wasn’t lust waking him.

It was devotion, returning to post up.

And devotion, once remembered, does not need permission to stay.


¤¤¤¤¤

What Wakes When Discipline Sleeps

¤¤¤¤¤


The room loosened its grip on him.

Not all at once.

Not violently.

It softened, the way a held breath softens when it’s finally let go.

He felt himself throbbing now to a slow, deliberate beat, a silent summons, not a demand,
the kind of rhythm that didn’t ask to be answered, only studied.

It pulsed like a beacon learning his frequency, patient as ritual,
a discipline of heat and hunger
meant to teach him how to move in time with gods.

The rain at the window thinned until it no longer sounded like rain at all. 

The rhythm remained, but the texture changed, each drop lighter, more deliberate, as if falling through leaves instead of glass.

Jaxx did not open his eyes.

He didn’t need to.

The space around him had shifted its grammar.

The mattress beneath his back no longer pressed in familiar places. 

The give was firmer, flatter, carrying the faint resistance of woven fiber rather than springs.

Tatami, his body supplied without asking permission, the word landing with a certainty that startled him.

The air cooled.

Not the sharp chill of Vancouver night, but something gentler, cleaner. 

It smelled faintly of smoke and wood and morning, a layered scent that suggested care rather than accident. 

Incense burned low somewhere nearby, not enough to announce itself, just enough to leave a trace.

His body understood before his mind caught up.

He was dressed.

Not the absence of nakedness, but the presence of weight.

Fabric rested along his arms and chest, structured and deliberate, layered with intention. 

The sleeves restricted movement just enough to remind him of posture, of alignment, of the importance of stillness.

He was standing now.

Not upright in defiance, but in readiness.

Behind someone.

The warmth he’d felt earlier resolved itself fully then, no longer abstract, no longer roaming. 

It was the heat of proximity, of another body just ahead of him, close enough that their breathing shared the same pocket of air.

The figure in front of him did not turn.

Dark hair fell straight and orderly at the nape of a neck that caught the low light like polished stone.

The back was straight, unbowed, carrying youth without fragility, presence without arrogance.

Jaxx felt the pull of it in his chest, deep and immediate.

This was the axis.

Not because of beauty, though there was beauty here, undeniable and precise. 

But because the world itself seemed to orient around the stillness of this person, bending subtly, respectfully, as if acknowledging a law it had not written but always obeyed.

He knew where his hands belonged.

Not touching.

Never touching.

Held just behind his own back, fingers folded, discipline intact.

The restraint did not feel like denial. 

It felt like purpose.

The younger man shifted his weight slightly, a barely perceptible adjustment, and the warmth between them intensified, the space closing by a fraction. 

Jaxx’s breath caught, then steadied, his body responding with an instinct older than language.

Protect.
Remain.
Endure.

The night had given way entirely now.

This was not dream logic.

This was memory settling into place.

Somewhere beyond the room, beyond the century, he felt the presence of walls, of gardens still holding their breath before dawn, of a world governed by ritual and watched closely by power.

And still, the figure before him did not turn.

Because he did not need to.

Jaxx was exactly where he had always stood.

Behind.


¤¤¤¤¤

The Night That Chose Position

¤¤¤¤¤


The stillness deepened.

Not silence, attention.

The younger man inhaled, slow and measured, as if tasting the air before deciding what to do with it. 

The movement was subtle, barely more than a shift of ribs beneath layered cloth, but it rippled outward, felt rather than seen.

Jaxx felt it register through him like a bell struck under water.

The figure spoke without turning.

“You stand too close.”

The words were quiet.

Not reprimand.
Not invitation.

Statement.

A truth acknowledged aloud so it would not have to be tested.

Jaxx lowered his gaze, though his spine did not bend. 

The posture was instinctive, ancient, the kind learned through repetition rather than instruction.

He knew the rule that lived inside that sentence. 

He had always known it.

Closeness was not forbidden.

It was consequential.

He wondered, why did this still make him press like forged steel,
still make it salivate like a starving wolf scenting sacred blood.

Jaxx didn’t think the dream strange. 

Many dreams had come in many shapes, cloaked in many skins. 

It had never been about the gender. 

The point was always the frequency, the connection. 

The spirit beneath, burning through whatever form it wore, calling him home.

What was it about this heat,
this memory, this echo, that summoned his body like it had never been fed, never been touched, never been claimed?

His answer did not reach his mouth.

It settled behind his sternum first, where vows lived before language gave them shape.

I stand where I am needed.

I always have.

The younger man’s shoulders eased a fraction, the smallest release of tension, as if the response had been heard without being spoken. 

The warmth between them shifted again, no longer sharp, no longer questioning.

Accepted.

The air in the room seemed to exhale with them.

Jaxx felt something seal into place, a recognition so complete it carried its own grief. 

This was not a moment meant to bloom. 

It was meant to hold. 

To endure weather, time, and consequence without demanding reward.

He understood, with a clarity that stung, that this was love shaped by duty rather than desire alone.

Love that chose position over possession.

Love that would never ask to be seen, but always was.

Behind them, somewhere beyond walls and gardens, power watched and did not yet understand what it was witnessing.

The younger man remained facing forward, steady and luminous in his restraint.

Jaxx stayed where he was.

Behind.

Exactly where the world would need him when it began to lean.

He wondered again, why did this love awaken such ache, such gravity, that it hung heavy between his legs like a cry for his hands to answer?

Why did desire wear such weight,
as if every drop of heat remembered lifetimes, and begged to be claimed again?

This wasn’t just arousal.

It was a summoning.

A sacred pulse demanding touch.

A truth too swollen to be ignored.



¤¤¤¤¤


Held Without Touch


¤¤¤¤¤


The room came back in pieces.

First the sound, rain against glass, uneven now, a city rhythm reclaiming its place. 

Then weight, the familiar pull of gravity settling into muscle and cock. 

The scent of cedar thinned, replaced by the neutral quiet of his apartment.

Jaxx’s eyes opened.

The ceiling above him was blank, unremarkable, the same faint crack near the corner he’d meant to fix and never had. 

His breath was unsteady, deeper than it should have been for sleep, his chest rising as if he’d run hard and stopped too fast.

His hands were warm.

Not moving.
Not clenched.

Simply… aware.

He stared at the ceiling, pulse loud in his ears, and waited for the sensation to finish what it had started. 

For the familiar arc of release, the easy answer his body knew so well.

It didn’t come.

Instead, something heavier settled in its place.

Grief.

Not sharp, not dramatic, a low ache that pressed in behind the ribs, layered over the heat like a hand laid gently on a wound. 

It surprised him more than the arousal had. 

He swallowed, throat tight, as if he’d woken with a word caught halfway to speech.

The warmth faded slowly, reluctantly, leaving behind the unmistakable imprint of having been held without being touched.

He rolled onto his other side, one knee drawn up, grounding himself in the shape of his own body. 

Even now, he felt his cock,
heavy, unrelenting, flip with a quiet thud when he shifted.

A pendulum of promise.
A weight that whispered:

soon.

There would be work.

Sacred. 
Urgent. 

Inevitable.

And only what breathed against him could finish it.

Jaxx had always had these memories.

Dreams.
Wet dreams.

Call them what you want.

Some came wrapped in pain, twisted in grief.

Others, like this, arrived wrapped in flame.

A memory not just of love…

but of desire so true it lit itself,
igniting without permission,
as if life itself wanted to remind him:

You were made to feel this.
You were made to burn.

These weren’t fantasies.

They were echoes.

Proof that something once sacred had happened, or would happen again.

Because desire this holy doesn’t need time.

It only needs a pulse.

The weight resting on the bed hung heavier than ever, thicker, fuller, signaling that now was the moment.

Jaxx, already slick with readiness, was startled by how the dream had held him down from the start.

Not just arousal.

Demand.

It struck him like a thunderclap behind the ribs.

The memory, a mouth, hands, the heat of devotion, didn’t just flash behind Jaxx’s eyes. 

It possessed him. 

Claimed him. 

Worshiped through him like scripture written in fire.

His cock throbbed, thick and swollen, pulsing with a tempo that felt ancient. 

Like it had waited across timelines just to erupt in this one. 

The shaft arched, fierce and flushed, slicked from base to crown with his own eager heat, glistening like obsidian dragged from the forge.

Jaxx’s breath hitched, then broke.

His spine arched as if caught in the pull of a magnetic truth, his body bowing to something older than control.

His hand moved with quiet urgency, wrapped around the thick weight of himself, fingers barely meeting, his grip more reverent than rushed.

His cock filled his palm like something forged, not grown? 

Heat pulsing steady beneath his skin, a rhythm he couldn’t ignore.

Every stroke was a conversation between memory and need, his body remembering what his mind hadn’t yet dared say aloud.

The rhythm of his hand surged, not frantic, but fated, a tide that had reached its edge and could no longer be held.

Heat bloomed.

A pulse deep and final coursed through him, emptying like light poured from a vessel cracked open by love.

It wasn’t just climax.

Not like a man.

Like something caught between dimgod and god.

The first pulse left him howling.

Back arched, hips snapping up with a raw, involuntary force. 

His thighs trembled, locked, as rope after rope of molten white surged from him, thick, searing, stubborn in its refusal to end.

It wasn’t just a release.

It was an offering.

A surrender to the bond he couldn’t see but felt braided around his spine.

His cock didn’t just spasm, it declared. 

It lashed against his belly with every spurt, hard and heavy, refusing to soften, twitching again, as if his body had more truths to spill.

And still, it came.

Spilling over his stomach. 

Onto his hand. 

Across his chest.

Hot.

Claiming.

Sacred.

A mess worthy of a shrine.

His ass clenched hard, fluttering, his prostate still throbbing like it, too, remembered a name, carved there like a spell. 

Even the tension between his cheeks felt offered, parted slightly, begging again without words.

He gasped, breath broken. 

Lips parted. 

Head tilted back as if receiving a vision.

He didn’t know Kai’s name.

He offered it.

Soundless.

Felt.

Etched in the curl of his toes, in the clench of his jaw, in the fire boiling through his cock until he collapsed, breathless, cock still twitching, still leaking, like the memory refused to let him go.

This wasn’t jerking off.

It was invocation.

He didn’t finish.

He arrived.

And the altar was him.

It was surrender, a giving over, a release that carried memory and longing, devotion and need,
etched into every shudder that left him gasping, hollowed and whole all at once.

He lay there writhing, chest rising, release warm across his skin, throbbing still, heavy, hard, not even done yet. 

His body humming like it knew: the offering wasn’t over.

The releases still coming in rushing wave, powerful enough to draw a sharp breath from him.

Heat spilled through his body in long, uncontrolled surges, leaving him trembling, chest rising and falling as the aftershocks chased each other through him.

His skin was warm, marked by cum, the evidence of surrender, a beautiful disarray spread across him like the aftermath of a storm that had finally broken.

He felt the weight of himself, thick and satisfied, slowly softening in his hand, still warm, still flushed with gratitude.

Each breath eased the tension in his chest, the final pulses fading like echoes after a storm.

His body had answered something ancient, and now, it rested, spent, full, and strangely at peace.

Jaxx shuddered once more, a deep, involuntary response, then slowly stilled, spent, open, emptied in the way only true release allows.

The room didn’t shake.

But something in him did.

And it would not settle the same again.

The discipline returned in increments, breath evening out, heart finding a steadier tempo.

But something essential had shifted.

This had not been imagination.

And it had not been desire in disguise.

It had been memory, not of events, but of position. 

Of standing behind someone whose presence reorganized the room, the century, the rules of what could be survived.

Jaxx closed his eyes again, not to sleep, but to feel.

Whatever had found him tonight had known him already. 

It had come with patience, with restraint, with the unmistakable certainty of something that would return whether he invited it or not.

He pressed his palm briefly to his sternum, feeling the echo there, quieter now but no less real.

“Okay,” he murmured to the dark.

Not in defiance. 
Not in fear.

In acknowledgment.

The rain outside softened.

The city breathed.

And somewhere beyond the reach of now, a garden waited, still holding its shape, still remembering where he stood.

Behind.
Always behind.

Exactly where the vow lived.


¤¤¤¤¤


Devotion, Practiced in the Dark


¤¤¤¤¤


Morning did not rush him.

It arrived the way truth does when it has nothing left to prove, quietly, without spectacle. 

Pale light slipped through the blinds in thin, patient lines, tracing the edge of the wall, the curve of his shoulder, the steady rise and fall of his breath.

Jaxx lay still.

Not asleep.

Listening.

The night had loosened its grip, but it had not let go entirely.

He could still feel the echoes of release, his cock warm, heavy, and deeply satisfied, like it had remembered its purpose and fulfilled it with reverence.

He reached down, cupping the weight still resting between his legs, warm, steady, and pulsing still with afterglow. 

It wasn’t just release. 
It was memory, echo, connection.

For a moment, he wondered, would that kind of fullness be cherished by someone else the way he'd felt it in the dream?

The heat, the way it had wrapped around his cock with worship, made him feel not just wanted, but known.

A faint shiver traveled from the base of his cock to the center of his sphincture. 

Twitch.

His breath caught. 

Still responding, he realized. 

Still tuned to a signal that lingered long after the storm had passed.

And when he looked down, he wasn’t surprised to see the proof,
again.

What remained was not heat, not longing, not even the ache. 

It was something cleaner, heavier in its calm.

Certainty.

He sat up slowly, feet finding the floor, the familiar weight of his body grounding him back into this century. 

The apartment looked unchanged, disciplined as ever.

No trace of incense. 
No woven mats. 
No echo of silk or cedar.

And yet.

When he stood, he felt the space behind him differently, as if the air itself had learned where he belonged.

Behind.

Not as absence.

As structure.

He moved through the morning routine on instinct, breath counted, posture aligned. 

Cock heavy.

Coffee brewed. 

Water ran. 

The city woke without ceremony.

Everything functioned.
Everything fit.

But something inside him had been quietly named.

This was not a dream he would analyze.

Not a fantasy to be dismantled.
Not a desire to be managed.

It was a memory that had chosen its moment.

He knew, with the same unshakable clarity that guided his runs and his vows, that this was not the last time the past would touch him. 

It had only confirmed what his body had always known.

There was a life ahead that would require him to stand exactly where he always had.

Behind someone whose presence bent the world.

Behind a destiny that would not ask if he was ready.

He exhaled, long and steady, and let the certainty settle.

Somewhere far to the east, morning was breaking over a different city, over a different body, over a soul that had not yet learned why the air felt charged when he breathed in.

Jaxx didn’t need the name.

He didn’t need the face.

He only needed to be where he belonged when the moment arrived.

And that, at last, was enough.


¤¤¤¤¤


THE RITUAL OF LAYERS


¤¤¤¤¤


Jaxx began to get ready.

He dressed with care.

Not vanity, alignment.

He stood in front of the mirror, studying his reflection. 

The ache from the dream still lingered, not arousal exactly, but something deeper, more persistent. 

A readiness.

He adjusted himself with four fingers, trying to ease the weight pressing up against gravity.

Useless. 

The weight was obvious, it would be impossible to contain.

By mid-week, it would’ve drawn too many stares, curious, hungry, amused. 

Girls. 

Guys. 

Anyone with eyes.

He sighed, exasperated but not surprised.

This wasn’t lust for just anyone.

This was his body remembering a fire it couldn’t forget.

And if he wasn’t careful, he’d end up chasing ghosts again, falling into some girls bed trying to dig his way back, re-creating a heat that only answered to one name he didn't know.

Fingers curling briefly around the weight still pressing forward, alive with quiet insistence. 

He gave it a slow, thoughtful squeeze, not out of urgency, but recognition.

A reminder.

Of what he carried.
Of what still hadn't faded.

He paused.

White t-shirt.
White boxes briefs.
White socks.

The first layer went on clean and close, fabric smoothing the body into intention. 

He paused as he pulled it over his shoulders, breath steady, spine tall. 

There was a rightness to the order, a sequence his hands followed without instruction.

Second layer.

Lacoste shirt.
Baby blue.
Buttoned down with quiet precision.

Blue jeans.
Clean. 
Fitted. 

Heavy with memory.

White Nike Air Force 1s.

Untouched. 
Grounded. 

Waiting.

Weight added.

Movement narrowed.

Every piece a choice.
Every layer a quiet armor.

The mirror caught him briefly and released him just as fast. 

He didn’t study the reflection. 
He checked posture. 

Balance. 

The way the body carried responsibility before it carried heat.

As he buttoned the final layer, something old clicked into place.

Clothing as boundary.

Boundary as vow.

He remembered, not an image, not a scene, but the reason one dresses carefully when power is near. 

To contain. 
To respect. 

To be seen correctly by those who watch and misinterpret everything.

He adjusted the cuffs once.

Then again, finer.

A quiet satisfaction settled through him. 

Not pleasure. 

Readiness.

The mirror caught his reflection.

Built like a monument no one dared question, broad shoulders, carved lines, the kind of strength that didn’t ask permission.

Beautiful in the way storms are beautiful, not because they begged to be watched, but because the world paused when they passed.

He looked like the kind of man who could tilt a universe with one hand and hold a lover steady with the other.

A god, not by claim, but by design.

And anyone with sense would feel it in their bones.

He slung his bag over one shoulder and stepped toward the door. 

The space behind him felt occupied now, not by a presence, but by purpose. 

As if the air itself understood where to gather when he moved.

At the threshold, he stopped.

Just for a breath.

He did not look back.
He never had to.

Behind him, somewhere beyond rain and glass and years, a garden still held its shape. 

A younger man still faced forward. 

A world still leaned without knowing why.

Jaxx opened the door and stepped into the day.

The vow moved with him.

Unseen
Unbroken.

Somewhere deep inside him, beneath breath and cock, something pulsed, not just want, but warning.

A whisper of power not yet risen.

A tide still turning beneath the surface.

Not today.

But soon.

And when it came, the world would feel it.

Not as thunder.

As gravity.


¤¤¤¤¤

THE VEIL TURNS

¤¤¤¤¤


The rain thinned.

Not stopped, just… softened.

The city’s edges blurred, glass and pavement losing their insistence. 

The smell of wet concrete gave way to something older, quieter, like wood that had learned patience over centuries.

The hum beneath his ribs shifted key.

Footsteps no longer echoed. 

They brushed.

Light changed first. 

It stopped reflecting and began to rest.

Water gathered where it was meant to, not in gutters but in shallow bowls of stone. 

The air cooled without cold, carrying the faintest trace of smoke, not sharp, but sweet, as if something had been burned carefully, on purpose.

Time loosened its grip.

The straight lines of the city curved. 

Steel gave way to timber. 

The sound of engines thinned into wind moving through leaves it knew by name.

Somewhere, bamboo knocked once against bamboo. 

A sound too measured to be accident.

Breath slowed. 

Posture remembered itself.

The ground beneath his feet no longer asked for speed. 

It asked for presence.

And before the mind could insist on place or year or reason, the body recognized the truth first:

This was not Vancouver anymore.

This was a world where stillness carried weight, where devotion had rules, and where love learned to speak through restraint.

Dawn waited.

The air settled.

Not empty, not quiet, arranged.

Stone remembered its place beneath bare feet. 

Gravel held patterns no wind had dared disturb. 

The smell of cedar deepened, joined by ink, iron, and the faint sweetness of plum carried on cool breath.

A bell sounded once.

Not to mark an hour, but to acknowledge it.

Wooden shutters opened somewhere beyond sight. 

Silk whispered. 

Armor shifted softly, restrained by etiquette rather than weight.

This was Japan.

Not the Japan of maps or memory, but the living country of vows and watching eyes.

The year was the fifteenth century.

The Muromachi court still breathed. 

The Ashikaga banner still flew.

Beauty still carried consequence.

Here, a young man’s posture could alter a household. 

A glance could summon favor or ruin. 

And devotion, once given, rewrote futures.

Somewhere beyond the inner walls, a palace stirred. 

Monks prepared incense before dawn. 

Pages moved quietly, already aware that something in the morning would not proceed as expected.

A shōgun slept uneasily, his chest tight with a feeling he did not yet have language for.

And in the courtyard below, unseen by him but already pulling the air toward its center, someone knelt.

Waiting.

Define the concept clearly in simple language.

1pvgwzc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1pvgwzc/what_does_it_really_mean_to_put_yourself_out_there/,What does it really mean to put yourself out there?,"So I just made a post about standards just a minute ago and alot of people commented saying that ""if someone is telling you to lower your standards, it means that you havent been successful in dating."" And that is very fair to say. 

But in my life, I have never really approached alot of women to be honest. I have yet to go up to my type in real life and throw game. Im not scared perse but I feel dirty doing it. The few times that I have done it, I had pretty good results. 

For example, I asked a random girl once in a coffee shop, what was her favorite coffee was. She started to talk to me for a minute and then she started to show interest in me. She started as me where I am from and what do I do for a living. Its was kinda weird so I ended up the convo. Another time, yet again in a coffee shop, a married woman wanted me to sit next to her because I helped her find a phone charger. I even chased down the manager to make sure she could charge her computer. I wasnt going to hit on her of course, but I found it strange so I left 

Last example, I once got on a handle boat with randoms to tour the city. While talking to a few people I met some girls who ended up bantering with me. One girl in particular wanted my instagram and her male friends wanted me to ""spit game"". I didnt and I left. Before I left she came up from behind and hugged me so she probably did like me. 

Point I am trying to make is that I still have been accused of not putting myself out there. What does that really mean? I understand in all these example I could have taken it farther. 

But am I suppose to approach women randomly? People in my grad school are off limits because they are kinda superficial. They all have a social hierarchy that they expect others to be part of. For example, since I didnt attend a party, alot of people stop talking to me. Plus most of the women are engaged.

Long time friend ko na sya since highschool pero nung college lang talaga kami naging super close. Sa circle namin, kaming 2 lang napunta sa same college, so naturally college pa lang naghahang out na kaming 2 lang. Last christmas party namin, naiwan kaming 2 lang mag-sleep over (natulog lang kami literal) from a night of drinking. Hinatid namin friends namin kasi need nila umuwi, then we stayed para uminom pa. 

This year, nagpatuloy yung paglabas namin na kaming 2 lang, pero minsan na lang compared nung college. Usually, if we would go out for coffee, kasama other friends, pero automatic na yung isa't isa una naming aayain. 

Eto na this year christmas party, lahat naman kaming friends nag-sleep over. Nung morning nauna umuwi ibang friends namin, so ang naiwan is me, him, and 2 other friends. Nauna ko bumango and magising saming apat. Y'all nung nagising sya GRRRRRR!! Ang messy ng hair nya and half open lang eyes nya and ang groggy pa ng voice nya tapos nakatingin lang sya sakin etc etc BRO WHY U LOOKIN LIKE THAT. I had to look away AGAD AGAD at baka magkatotoo ang christmas miracle eme

The elephant in the room shall never be addressed (by me) kasi mahirap ang complicated relationship with him, lalo na same circle kami. SO stop looking like a snack!! Kung gusto mo, ikaw umamin, o-oo naman ako agad ehe

I am torn between Redmond / Kirkland and Queen Ann, Ballard, Madison Park. I’ll be renting an apartment and I am trying to balance lifestyle, location, and social opportunities.

I’m single, 41, work fully remote, and don’t know anyone in the area yet. I’m drawn to Seattle for the greenery, scenery, and weather, and I really enjoy driving around for errands and exploring different neighborhoods (as opposed to needing to walk everywhere). That said, I do like having walkable areas nearby for relaxing strolls, coffee, or just getting out of the house.

I do want to be in an area where it’s still realistic to meet other single women in a similar age range whether that’s through casual social spots, activities, or just being in a generally social area. Although, everyone seems to rely on the dating apps these days.

I’m open to city neighborhoods as well as nearby suburbs if they offer a good balance of green space, convenience, and community. I’d really appreciate insights on:

* Neighborhoods that fit a “green + relaxed + still social” vibe
* Areas that work well for someone remote who likes to drive but also enjoys occasional walkability
* Any neighborhoods that might be especially good (or not so good) for singles in their late 30s / early 40s

I have a very pretty girlfriend
I’m not looking for sex
