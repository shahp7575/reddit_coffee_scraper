1lwgqz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1lwgqz9/grinding_finer_has_everything_tasting_a_little/,Grinding finer has everything tasting a little different,"Up until recently, my daily cup recipe has been pretty well constructed. I brew with an XL, 20g of coffee beans ground on a DF54 at 40. I steep for 5 mins and plunge 400g of coffee in to my primed(hot water) mug. I prefer single origin, light to medium roasted coffee. I have a local go to roaster within walking distance of work. I find myself really enjoying coffees from Honduras, Kenya and Columbia. On occasion I'll grab some bags from other roasters and a busy will also grab bags when in Portland from will known roasters. Recently he got 2 bags from 2 different roasters in PDX and they were popular blends. Both appeared to be medium to dark roasted and following my standard brew protocol were unimpressive and left me tasting blah coffee. After multiple brews I shelved them thinking I'd rather have the cup I enjoy every morning. That was until I decided to try grinding finer with both said coffees. Mind blown! At much finer grinds the generic flavor of coffee was gone and they presented rich, flavorful cups I bet much enjoyed until the non bitter end. Now I'm beginning to change my grinds on my current bags of lighter roasted beans and finding they flavor profiles are slightly different, in a better way. I'm feeling a little unfortunately with the increased amount of possibilities now. So I guess my paradigm is shifting, I'm changing grind sizes and adding new flavors to my life. Anyone else change grind size for different beans? Happy AP coffee drinking!",1,1752163942.0,AeroPress,0,1.0,False

1lwgom5,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1lwgom5/feeling_stuck_between_burnout_and_wanting_to_do/,Feeling stuck between burnout and wanting to do something meaningful,"I struggle a lot with trying to be productive or to have something to be productive about. Does this happen to anyone else?

This might not be the typical post about productivity but I need to get it off my chest. I'll tell you my work schedule first:

08:00 / 09:00 – Wake up (depends if working from home or commuting)    
08:00–09:00 / 09:00–10:00 – Drink coffee, get ready for work    
09:00–10:00 – Commute    
10:00–18:00 – Work    
18:00–19:00 – Commute back    
19:00–19:20 – Eat something    
19:20–20:00 – Nap (feeling very tired)    
20:00–20:30 – Wake up, shower, unwind    
20:30–21:30 – Free time (currently working on side gig website)    
21:30–22:00 – Get ready and head to the gym    
22:00–23:40 – Gym    
00:00 – Sleep

Firstly, I feel like I don’t have enough time to do anything. I currently work on a side gig, but that will end in a week or two. I want to do something productive with my time but I don’t have the motivation to do anything and I don’t know what to do either.

In 2020 I had an IG page and a yt channel that gained a bit of traction in my country for the memes I made about local celebs, but I burnt out quickly because I don’t really consume that type of media (watching celebs in my country). I liked the video editing aspect of it; I sometimes would do it for 8–12 hours a day and I wouldn’t get bored of it. I also didn’t get burnt out of editing, which was surprising. Since then, I wanted to do something media related.

I won’t lie, I am money driven. But one of my struggles is that I just can’t stick to one thing. I tried all kinds of stuff, from making beats, video editing, programming, making logos, 3D animation for music videos, doing Photoshop, made small games, etc. Some made me money, some not. The programming part stuck with me for a while and I got a job as a programmer (my current job). I liked programming a lot too, but since I got my job, now it feels like just a job and I can't program anything outside of it. The job pays okay, average salary in my country, but I want to do something bigger on the side. Like a yt channel, but I struggle a lot to find what to make content about. I tried making what I consume on yt (documentaries), but I don’t really like that part of it. I like the video editing part though. I tried making Roblox games in the past weeks, but I burnt out of that really quick too.

I want to do something that would appeal to the masses. I like that stuff. I loved when I did video editing for a client and all we would do was to analyse the watch time, what to improve, etc. And those views were like pure dopamine. Watching a video blow up over a million views. But I can’t start a channel of my own, I can’t find an idea of a niche. I also feel like I can’t find my true passion. I struggled for years with this. I still do. I stress for months at a time that I want to do something, but I don’t know what to do. I feel like I'm in a loop. A job is not enough.

\*\*TL;DR:\*\*

I feel stuck and exhausted. I’ve tried many creative things but nothing really sticks. I love video editing and want to do something impactful, but I’m low on time, energy, and direction. Feels like I’m stuck on repeat.",1,1752163786.0,findapath,1,1.0,False

Being the best WO1 in the Army, I volunteer myself to guard the laptops in the TOC in order to enjoy that sweet, sweet air conditioning. I have the graveyard shift, so I made an entire pot of coffee; as a single cup just doesn't give me the tingles like it used to. As I'm sitting there, reading starship troopers for the third time in this training event, it hits me.

My stomach begins churning knots. I glacé at the coffee pot- realizing that I had used chemically treated iodine water for my brew. The soldier on shift with me got pulled for a detail an hour ago, and the TOC portapotties are on the other side of the field. Remembering my general orders, I ordain not to abandon my post. I search frantically for any reprise from my current condition. Feeling the pressure building, I know that I only have a few seconds.

I grab an empty MRE bag from the trash can that I had for dinner. Holding the bag open, I unleash an unholy concoction of Folgers and MRE#9 beef stew into the bag. I grab onto the table in front of me for support, the singed skin of my sphincter screaming in agony.

I pull my pants up, tighten my belt, place the now half- filled MRE bag back in the trash can, wrap the bag up, and put the entire can outside the tent. That's a problem for end-of-shift me.

it stresses me out so badly and i feel like especially with my much more experienced coworker im trying my best but it’s getting me nowhere with the restaurant part.

long story short, during an extremely crazy rush (we’re quite short staffed, untrained me and my one coworker) to the point customers were sharing tables because we had no room, i was unloading the dishwasher fast and put a hot plate onto a glass tray, smashed everywhere and inside the dishwasher, also messed up orders because i didn’t take them fast enough and our chef was overwhelmed. 

since last Saturday, i got a text today saying they brought back a more experienced staff member and will just call me when they need me rather than have me every Saturday like usual. i just feel useless and like crap. i don’t even wanna show my face there again and my coworker makes me feel like im stupid. is it worth staying? my pay will probably go down too. 

thanks in advance for any help. i was thinking of just stepping away and finding a new job. :( ",1,1752163640.0,careeradvice,0,1.0,False

Monday morning was quiet. Peaceful, even.

I woke up at 4:00 a.m. sharp—no nightmare, no sweat-drenched sheets, no lingering screams clawing their way out of my throat.

Just... silence.

The shower felt warmer than usual, like it was trying to lull me back to sleep. I stood there longer than I meant to, letting it run over my face. Steam clung to the mirror, but I wiped it away out of habit.

I looked okay. Normal, maybe. My skin wasn’t as pale. I couldn’t find the grey hair anymore—just soft brown. My eyes looked tired, sure, but less... exhausted. Like someone had rewound me a few days.

I actually felt hungry. I wanted to make breakfast.

I headed downstairs, a little unsteady, but upright. Head high.

The light switch clicked under my fingers. The kitchen blinked to life.

And there they were.

Tentacles.

They slithered in through the living room like they’d always been there—slow and deliberate, crawling across the floor in perfect silence.

My blood turned to ice. My skin prickled all over.

I just... watched.

Then I moved.

The living room was dim. I didn’t remember turning off that lamp in the corner, but it was dark now. The thing stood just beside the front door. Its tentacles coiled around its body, spiraling down to the floor, threading through the carpet fibers like roots.

It didn’t move. Didn’t even twitch.

But I could feel it watching me, it’s hateful gaze piercing my soul, though it had no eyes.

I walked back into the kitchen. My hands went on autopilot: eggs, pan, salt. My heartbeat thudded behind my teeth the whole time. I kept catching glimpses of it in my peripheral vision—never direct, never center frame. Just shadows at the edge of thought.

I plated the eggs. They looked fine. Like any other Monday.

At 5:07, I heard her.

“Hey James,” Daria mumbled, her voice thick with sleep.

I turned slightly, keeping the thing just out of view. Daria wrapped her arms around my waist, resting her face between my shoulder blades.

“James, I slept horribly,” she groaned, half-pouting.

I turned to her, leaving the bowl on the counter. Her hair was tangled. Her eyes were puffy. She looked soft, human. Warm.

“Are you okay?” I asked, folding her into a hug. I kissed the crown of her head.

She nodded her head lazily.

“I love you, Daria,” I whispered.

She murmured something into my back—something like “love you more.”

I didn’t look at the thing again.

I left through the back door.





At 12:30 I got the call I’ve been waiting for. Daria’s voice radiated from the phone, she sounded so excited, so happy.

“Ok James, you better get your things in order, I’m leaving for the clinic ok.” She giggled “Don’t you flake on me this time.” Then her voice softened a bit “Please come this time.”

Dad, just like I thought, let me go. He put his hands on my shoulders firmly, giving me this fake serious expression.

“Son, I’m going to fire you if you don’t bring me pictures, last time I had to beg Daria for them.”

I pulled into the parking lot at 12:50. The clinic was empty; the only cars that were there were staff.

I walked through the door, a chime accompanying my entrance. I stated my name and who I was here for. A nurse—I think—ushered me in.

The ultrasound room was colder than I expected—small, windowless, lit only by the dull glow of a computer screen. A plastic bottle of clear gel sat next to the keyboard like a condiment on a diner table. The exam bed was draped in thin, crinkly paper that rustled every time Daria moved.

She lay back slowly, belly exposed, the rest of her half-covered with a hospital sheet that barely reached her knees. The technician—a middle-aged woman with kind eyes and no visible interest in small talk—squeezed the gel onto Daria’s stomach. It glistened under the soft overhead light.

Then came the wand. She pressed it down—not painfully, but firm. Still Daria flinched.

The screen flickered—grey static, then shadows swimming.

A curve. A twitch. A ripple of movement.

“There’s the heartbeat,” the tech said gently.

Then the sound filled the room. Fast. Watery. Mechanical. Like a horse galloping underwater. It made my skin crawl.

Daria squeezed my hand. “You hear that, James?” she whispered, smiling.

But I wasn’t looking at her.

The image was wrong.

At first, it looked like a baby’s head—but then the skull **bulged outward**, pulsing as if something inside was pushing to get out.

From the spine, **long black cords** extended—slick, rope-like, **moving**. Not waving. **Reaching**. One uncoiled and brushed the edge of the screen.

Another pulsed from the abdomen—**thicker than the legs**, like a root burrowing into the flesh from the inside.

My body locked. I couldn’t breathe. My hand twitched in Daria’s, but she didn’t look at me.

“He’s really growing,” she giggled. “He’ll be as big as us someday.”

I stared at the screen, bile rising in my throat.

Then—**blink.**

The image was normal again.

A baby. Just a baby. Soft skull. Normal limbs. Perfect little heartbeat.

Then the tech hit a button. The image vanished.

Daria beamed. “That was amazing.”

I just nodded, still gripping her hand, my palm ice-cold.





Ever since that morning, the thing hasn’t stopped watching.

At night, it waits in the bedroom corner.

During the day, it stands beside the front door—silent, still, always there.

I pass it every time I come home. I don’t look at it anymore. I hear it whispering when I close my eyes—sharp, venomous syllables in a language I can’t begin to understand. They rattle in my skull like static.

Sleep is a joke now. Work’s worse than ever. I’ve been moved to the prep station just to keep up with the flood of orders. Bills are stacking, and the real estate deal I need to close keeps slipping further away. I’ve even thought about asking Dad for help. But all of that… faded when I opened the front door that night. It was the Monday after Daria’s ultrasound.

The box with the crib was sitting in the nursery. Daria was painting clouds on the baby-blue walls, her brush moving slow and steady.

She turned as I stepped in. “Oh! I didn’t know you’d be home so early.”

I held up the pizza box. “It’s six o’clock. Figured I’d pick up dinner.”

She smiled. “That actually sounds amazing right now.”

I pointed at one of the clouds. “That one does not look anything like a cloud.”

It looked more like a blob than a nice soft cloud.

She pouted. “I’ve never been an artist, and it’s not like the baby’ll care.”





Dinner was quiet in the best kind of way. The thing didn’t appear. The kitchen felt warm again—like it used to. I honestly couldn’t even taste the pizza.

Daria sat across from me, still in her paint-streaked clothes, eyes soft and glowing in the evening light. The sunlight poured through the window, catching her hair—it looked like fire paused mid-flicker.

She caught me staring. “Jamie,” she said, tilting her head.

“Yeah?”

“What are you looking forward to most?” She rested her chin in her hand. “About the baby, I mean.”

I thought for a second. “Family dinners,” I said finally. “Us at the table. All of us. Just... eating together. When he’s older, of course.”

She smiled like she was already there, watching it happen.

“I’m looking forward to taking care of him,” she said softly. “The house is so quiet sometimes. I can’t wait for it to be messy and loud and alive. I want to hear little feet on the floor.” She placed her hand on her belly and laughed gently. “He’s kicking again. I think he knows we’re talking about him.”

I stood and moved around the table, crouching beside her. “Really?”

She took my hand and guided it to her stomach. A few seconds passed—and then I felt it: a firm, tiny nudge beneath the skin. Like a heartbeat you could touch.

My lips curled into a smile I didn’t have to think about. “Still feels like a muscle twitch to me.”

She laughed. “Don’t ruin the magic, James.”

I kissed the side of her belly. “Okay. That one was a ninja kick.”

She beamed, running her fingers through my hair. “We still need a name.”

I nodded. “I know. Feels like we’re behind.”

She looked off, thoughtful. Then her eyes found mine again. “Honestly? I like James Jr.”

I raised an eyebrow. “Really?”

She nodded. “I like the way it sounds. And it means I get to call him Junior. That just feels right, you know?”

She grinned. “Can’t wait to chase him around the house yelling it.”

I laughed with her. I really did. For a moment, it was like none of it mattered—not the exhaustion, not the dreams, not the bills. Just me, her, and the baby we were waiting on. But the moment didn’t last. It never can.





The thing won’t leave me alone anymore.

It follows me now. Not just at home. Not just in dreams.

At work, it stands in the back corner of the freezer—just far enough into the shadows that the frost doesn’t touch it. I see it when I turn around, after grabbing a box of sausage patties or hash browns. Just… standing there. Watching.

It never moves. But every time I turn my back, I swear I feel it leaning forward. Like it’s *considering* something.

At the firm, it’s stationed beside the coffee machine. Mary thinks I’m lazy. She keeps giving me this puzzled look every time I ask her to pour my cup. I can’t explain it to her. 

It’s back by the front door at home, too. Same place as always. Still as furniture. Just part of the layout now.

I’ve stopped reacting. If I don’t acknowledge it, maybe it won’t do anything. Maybe it just wants to be seen. Maybe it already *knows* everything.

I’m not sleeping. Not really. I rest in fragments now. Fifteen minutes here. Maybe an hour on the couch if I’m lucky. I’ve been getting up earlier just to get ahead of it. 4:30 a.m., every morning. McDonalds opens at five. I try to be there before it notices I’m gone.

I’m starting to feel like a robot. Just going through the same motions every day. I can’t tell if I’m even exhausted.

The only upside is the money. With how much I’ve been working, I’ve finally pulled ahead. Two real estate deals closed last week—$7,000 sitting in my account. It’s the most I’ve had in years. Enough to cover the hospital. Enough for the next two months of bills. Enough to maybe even buy Daria something nice.

But none of it feels real. It’s just numbers.

Daria’s due soon.





**Sunday, I took an extra shift at McDonald’s.** Daria looked disappointed when I told her.

Still, I managed to finish the crib. Daria got the nursery painted.

It’s strange, standing in that room now — soft blue walls, clouds near the middle, faintly cartoonish. It feels so… nice, in there. I even helped with the ceiling — stuck glow-in-the-dark stars to it, so when it's bedtime, it looks like a night sky frozen in time.

This morning, I caught Daria just standing there — arms crossed, hands on her hips, scanning the room like a commander surveying a battlefield. Every now and then, she’d adjust something. A stuffed animal. A mobile. A blanket corner. Then step back. Then forward again.

She’s adorable when she’s like that.

But the moment I got to work, the feeling curdled.

The thing had moved.

It stood dead center in the lobby — out in the open now, waiting for me behind the register.

It stared through me.

Its tentacles stretched slowly outward, crawling up the walls, spilling across the ceiling like roots. The air felt thick — humid, oppressive. Like standing in a jungle that had long since rotted.

The smell hit next: mold and something older, something wet and dead.

And still, no one noticed.

Customers stepped on the tendrils, slick and pulsing. I heard them squish underfoot. A kid leaned against the wall, I watched a strand of black slime fall down and soak into his hair — thick and glistening.

He didn’t flinch.

His parents kept eating.

I made it through the shift. Barely. By the end, I couldn’t feel my fingers. My legs moved without me.

I almost ran out the door.

My phone rang as I reached the car.

I climbed inside, hands shaking, and answered.

“James?” Daria’s voice crackled through the phone, slightly alarmed.

“Yes?” I responded.

“Your parents are coming over. They just called and said they’d be over in 30 minutes.” She explained.

“What!” I half yelled into my phone. “No notice, no nothing?”

“I know, I was just about to get in the bath.” She continued. “Do you want me to just order some pizza? I mean that’s what we always have, I don’t have time to cook them lunch.”

I sighed. “Yeah, that’d be fine. Order the bigger, more expensive pizzas. I'll bill it to Dad. Dad likes Meat Lovers, and Mom likes pineapple, uhh, nevermind — get her cheese and we’ll keep it.”

She giggled. “Alright, at least we’ll get something out of it.”

I hung up, still staring at the empty passenger seat.

Traffic was worse than I expected. It took me thirty-five minutes to get home.

Dad’s big, showy SUV was parked crooked in the driveway, taking up most of it and leaving Daria’s car awkwardly squeezed in. I had to reverse back out and park on the street just to avoid boxing them in.

When I walked inside, my parents and Daria were already gathered at the table, chatting. Four oversized pizza boxes sat stacked in the middle like a makeshift centerpiece. She’d really ordered the expensive ones — probably twelve bucks each.

“Well, look who finally showed up,” Dad bellowed from across the room.

I scanned the house. No sign of the thing.

“James, why haven’t you called your mother?” Mom was already up, arms open, pulling me into a hug.

She smelled like expensive lotion and wine. Her long blond hair hadn’t grayed yet — always perfectly brushed. In her mid-fifties, but she still dressed like she was on her way to a charity gala. And that expression — vaguely disappointed, like she was reviewing a hotel room she didn’t book.

Over her shoulder, Daria caught my eye. We shared the same look: *Really?*

“You look exhausted,” Mom said, brushing her fingers across my cheek. “Are you even sleeping?”

I pulled back, gently. “Been working a lot.”

Her silence demanded more.

“My insurance isn’t great. I want to have enough saved for the birth,” I added.

She gave a tight nod, but her eyes kept scanning my face like she was still looking for something to fix.

“So,” Dad said, rising with a grunt and wiping his hands on a napkin, “where’s my grandson going to be staying? I’m not paying for this pizza until I see it.”

I pointed upstairs, but he was already moving. Daria followed, probably to keep him from poking into the wrong room.

Before I could follow, Mom placed a manicured hand on my shoulder.

“You could’ve done better than pizza, James,” she said, voice clipped.

I turned. “You gave us thirty minutes’ notice. What did you expect, a five-course meal?”

“Pizza just… doesn’t reflect status,” she replied, as if that explained anything. Then she swept past me and headed upstairs.

That’s always been Mom. More concerned with appearances than effort. She’s never worked a day in her life, but you’d think she ran a Fortune 500 company the way she talked about “presenting well.”

I followed them upstairs.

The nursery door was open.

**And there it was.** The thing stood at the end of the hallway, etched in shadow. Its tentacles hung like vines — draping from the ceiling, crawling along the floor, weaving across the walls. But they all **stopped** just short of the nursery doorway.

I stepped into the nursery, calm on the outside, skin crawling beneath.

“Whoa,” Dad said, craning his neck to look up. “You even did the stars on the ceiling. Do they glow?”

“They do,” Daria said proudly. “James put them up.” She looked down at her belly and added with a laugh, “I’m… not tall enough.”

Mom stood near the bookshelf, smiling with polite approval. “You’ve really created a lovely space for Junior.”

Daria beamed. “I know, right? We worked so hard on this. James built the furniture, and I painted and decorated. It took forever. I wish we’d done it earlier — before I got so… round.”

She walked them through every piece of it — the crib, the clouds, the night-sky ceiling. Her voice was light, full of pride and love. For a moment, it felt like all the bad things were far away.

I stood by the door, nodding occasionally, eyes flicking back to the hallway.

The thing didn’t move.

Eventually, we filtered back downstairs.



The living room lights were too bright. The air felt too still. And the pizza smelled off — greasy and sharp, like cardboard soaked in salt. I chewed through a slice without tasting it, nodding along to whatever conversation my parents were having. But my mind was still upstairs.

Would the thing turn our house into another jungle, like it did McDonald’s? Would the walls start sweating, the floors pulse underfoot, the air grow thick and wet and moldy?

I flinched at the thought.

“James?” My mother’s voice cut through the fog.

I blinked. Everyone was staring. Even Daria.

“James, yoo-hoo. Earth to James,” Dad said, waving a hand in front of my face with a chuckle.

“Sorry.” I shifted in my chair. “Spaced out.”

Daria gave me a concerned glance.

“Well,” Mom said, brushing a napkin across her lips, “we’re heading to Florida next week. A little early spring break. You two should come.”

Dad jumped in. “We’ll cover it — the flights, hotel. Everything.”

He meant **he** would. My mother had never paid for anything but Botox and judgment.

Daria hesitated. “Elizabeth, I’d love to, but… I don’t think I can. The baby could come any time now. The doctor said we should be on alert.”

“You’re at 32 weeks, right?” Dad asked, squinting.

“Thirty-six,” she corrected, more gently than I would’ve.

I cleared my throat. “And with hospital bills, I need to pick up more hours.”

Mom let out a tight, irritated sigh — the kind that could cut drywall.

“I suppose that’s a no, then,” she said, her tone flat but pointed.

I nodded. “Yeah. Sorry. It’s just bad timing.”

Dad draped an arm around her shoulder. “Hey, it’s fine. No pressure. Next time.”

There was an awkward silence after that. Just the sound of crust crunching and someone’s chewing. I glanced over at Daria — she looked a little stunned, but she shrugged and leaned forward to grab another slice.

Eventually, they stood to leave. Mom offered a stiff goodbye hug. Dad slapped my back and told me to “keep grinding.” They left the leftover pizza.

I stood in the doorway watching their SUV pull away, the tail lights glowing red in the dimming sky.

Daria joined me, folding her arms across her chest.

“I’m starting to get sick of pizza,” I muttered.

She laughed softly. “I’m not. Still my favorite.”

We stood there a while, not saying anything. Just the hum of the fridge and the ticking clock.



Daria was still standing in the entryway, arms crossed. Her hair was caught in the overhead light, glowing faintly orange. She shifted, hesitating.

“James… does your mom dislike me?” she asked, softly.

I turned to her. She wasn’t angry. Just small. Like the question had been sitting in her chest all night and finally found its way out.

“No,” I said quickly. “Daria, she just… you know how she is. My mom’s too concerned with how things *look*. That’s her whole deal. Don’t take it personally.”

She nodded, but didn’t look relieved.

“I just…” She rubbed one arm with the other. “I want both to like me. My parents don’t even want to see me.”

She looked down. Her voice dropped a bit. “I called them a couple days ago. Told them they’d have a grandchild soon.”

I stayed quiet.

“They wanted me to go to college,” she continued. “And as they put it, *‘do something with your life.’* Like creating a new one doesn’t count.”

Her shoulders slumped, Her expression falling.

“Is that normal?” she asked, barely above a whisper.

“No,” I said, stepping closer. “That’s not normal at all. It’s cruel. They’re losing the best part of their lives.”

She nodded again, but slower this time.

I tried to soften the air. “Don’t worry about my parents, okay? They like you. You should’ve seen my mom when I told her you were pregnant—it actually knocked her out of her ‘ice queen’ routine. She and Dad were literally jumping for joy. I’ve never seen them do that. Ever.”

That earned a small smile. Just a twitch at the corners of her mouth, but it was enough.

I flopped onto the couch with a sigh and grabbed the remote. The living room was dim except for the amber spill of light from the kitchen and the pale blue flicker of the TV screen coming to life.

Daria eased down beside me. Her hands rested on her stomach.

“I mean, I have you,” she said, gently. “So it’s all good.”

She laughed—not forced. Just tired and soft. “I can’t wait for the baby.”

I turned on some dumb Hallmark movie.

“Oh I bet, he’s pretty heavy,” I joked.

She looked jokingly taken aback then poked my cheek. “You know, James, most people are more excited about the *birth* of their child than just its *physical weight.*”

I shrugged, smiling. “Yeah, though he’s probably heavy. Especially today. Almost seems like he’s lower down.”

She nodded, rubbing her stomach slowly. “He’s going to be a big guy. I can feel it.”

She leaned her head onto my shoulder, a content little breath slipping out of her.

“Probably gonna outgrow his dad,” I said. “Definitely his grandpa. He’s short.”

Daria giggled. “You’re not exactly a giant, James.”

“No,” I said, mock-sulking. “But I’m medium tall.”

We sat like that for a while—her head on my shoulder. The glow from the TV painted shifting light across the room.

Daria pointed at the screen. “I didn’t know we got these silly movies.”

She turned her head, squinting up at me. “You’re not *paying* for these, are you?”

I shook my head. “No. I don’t even have time to sit down and watch anything.”

She nodded, then grew quiet—her eyes tracking something across the carpet.

“Hey, James?” she asked, her voice soft.

“Yeah?”

“What do you think Junior’s favorite color will be?”

She looked down as she asked it, hands smoothing her belly like she was already trying to comfort him.

“Blue,” I said.

Daria furrowed her brow looking up again. “Why? You said that pretty fast.”

“Well... we painted his room blue. So, I mean... logic, right? Mine’s red because my race car bed as a kid was red.”

She smirked. “Fair. That’s a fair hypothesis.”

I looked at the screen. The movie was already halfway in. Some guy in a perfectly tailored suit was talking on two phones at once.

“Wanna watch the movie?” I asked. “Thirty bucks says the initial fiancé’s a rich guy who’s too busy for the female lead.”

“As long as it’s with you,” she said, resting her cheek against my shoulder again. “Sure.”

I wrapped my arm around her. It all felt so… warm.

Daria shifted, uncomfortable.

I looked at her to see what was wrong, but she was focused on the movie.



The movie ended in the usual soft-focus blur—kisses, confessions, everyone conveniently happy. Daria stretched, yawning, and glanced at the clock.



“Oh. It’s already six o’clock,” she said with mock disappointment. “I’m guessing it’s bedtime for you.”

“Yep,” I said, standing with a groan. “Big breakfast planned. Extravagant, within our means.”

“Leftover pizza?” she teased.

“Nope. I bought the expensive bacon. We’re celebrating thirty-seven weeks.”

She blinked. “It’s thirty-six weeks.”

I laughed. “Got my weeks messed up. I realized when you told dad earlier.”

She lightly smacked my arm, half-smiling. “James, you can’t be forgetting that kind of thing.”

“I’ve got a lot on my mind,” I said. “Guess I’ll have to carry you to bed as penance.”

“Oh, so now we’re romantic,” she said, grinning.

“Just making up for lost time.”

I scooped her into a princess carry, slow and steady.

“You know you’re heavy,” I muttered as I shifted my grip.

She narrowed her eyes, amused. “James, if you want this to be your only child, keep talking.”

“Honestly, between my mouth and my jobs, we’re probably maxed out anyway.”

She laughed—real and bright. “With time, James. With time.”

I started up the stairs. The thing was in the hallway. Its limbs were still. Tentacles curled tight against the ceiling beams, pulling slightly farther away. I didn’t look at it long.

I carried Daria past without speaking. The monster didn’t move.

I laid her gently on the bed. She giggled as I pulled the covers over her and kissed her forehead.

“Love you, James,” she mumbled, already sinking into the pillows.

“Love you too,” I said, settling down beside her.

Her warmth met mine in the quiet.

She shifted a little, one arm draped across my chest. The house was still—no pipes creaked, no cars passed, no distant sirens. Just the faint hum of the fridge downstairs and her breathing, deepening by the second.

The room felt... soft. Like it was holding its breath.

I pulled her close.

And drifted off.





I was in the field again.

The marigolds shimmered under starlight— but the grass was gone. Only dirt now. Dry, cracked, and dark as ash.

The stars overhead burned brighter than I remembered. Sharper. Hungrier. And the sky— darker somehow, though it was full of light.

I turned to face the moon— but the moon was gone.

In its place hung the shattered corpse of a planet, fractured like broken glass, the pieces frozen mid-collapse.

A sudden weight pressed into my arms. I looked down.

It was a baby. But not.

Tentacles curled from its skull—short, underdeveloped things, limp across my forearms like damp seaweed. Its skin was gray, veined with faint pulses of sickly violet. Rotted in places, soft in others. Still warm.

Its arms reached for me, weak but eager. Its legs kicked gently, like it was happy.

There was no malice in it. Only motion. Only need.

The air was cool and clean. Almost peaceful. The thing shivered.

Then came the sound—a thin, high-pitched squeal, shrill and slurred. I flinched.

But didn’t let go.

It made the sound again—closer to a giggle now. Then: “Dada.”

Distorted—garbage-slick and wrong. But unmistakable.

 It had no face, no mouth, no breath—only writhing tentacles where lips should be. Still, it spoke.

“Dada.”

And again. Softer. Pleased. Happy.

Something inside me trembled. Not fear. Something else.

Warmth?

For a second—only a second—I swore I heard Daria’s laugh buried in its voice. Warped. Twisted. Like a cassette tape melting in the sun.  
  


 This was mine?

I was holding my baby? The thought came fast, uninvited. Part of me screamed. This thing—this impossibility—it was mine.

Then came the scream.

From behind me. Inhuman. Enraged.

The wind rose. Cold. Furious.

I curled the baby tighter in my arms, shielding it with my body.

Then— a wet touch around my ankle. A tendril. Slippery. Hungry. Rising.

Before I could move, it yanked me down.





I woke with a start. Labored breath. The feeling of something wet.

The clock read 3:12 a.m.

I sat up fast and turned to Daria.

She was hunched over, gripping her stomach, her face pale and tight. “James,” she whispered. “I think I’m in labor.”

She winced, one hand bracing against the mattress, the other reaching for me. “It started a while ago,” she said, her voice strained. “Ten minutes apart. Then seven. Now five.”

Her fingers dug into my arm as another wave hit. She hissed through her teeth. “It’s not stopping, James.”

I looked down. The sheet beneath her was damp—just enough to darken the fabric. “I think my water broke,” she murmured. Her eyes didn’t leave mine.

“Okay. Let’s get your stuff. Can you walk?” She nodded.

I dressed fast, yanking my phone off the charger and leaving the cord behind. I helped her out of bed, steadying her with one arm around her waist.

The night air was cold as I guided her to the car.

I helped her into the front seat, reclined it slightly, and pulled the seatbelt across her lap. Her breath hitched again as she closed her eyes through another contraction.

“You’re doing great,” I said, not sure if it was true.

I climbed in, jammed the keys into the ignition. The car dinged at me like it didn’t know what was happening.

I should’ve called ahead.

But I didn’t.

I just drove.

The streets were empty.





I pulled into the small circle in front of the ER entrance. No valet. No one outside. Just the buzz of a flickering overhead light.

I threw the car into park and hopped out, rushing around to open her door. Daria’s eyes were half-closed, her hands gripping the seatbelt like a rope. Her breathing had gone shallow and rhythmic, like she was counting something only she could hear.

“Can you walk?” I asked, already unbuckling her.

She nodded, jaw clenched. “Let’s go.”

I helped her out, one arm around her back. She leaned into me hard—half her weight on my shoulder—and we shuffled through the automatic glass doors.

Inside, the air was too bright. Too clean. A front desk sat under blue LED lights, empty except for a lone nurse typing something into a terminal.

She looked up.

“Hi, she’s—my wife’s in labor,” I stammered. “Thirty-six weeks. Water broke.”

The nurse stood instantly. “Let’s get you into triage.”

She hit a button. Another set of doors hissed open. A second nurse appeared, pushing a wheelchair.

Daria tried to wave it off. “I’m okay,” she said, weakly.

But she sat.

The nurse wheeled her fast down a long, silent hallway. I kept pace beside them, phone clutched in my hand, heart knocking against my ribs like it wanted out.

We turned through a side corridor and into a narrow exam room. Low bed. Machines. Plastic curtain pulled halfway across the tile floor. A blood pressure cuff hung limp from the wall.

“Hospital gown’s on the chair. Change as much as you can. I’ll be back to check dilation,” the nurse said.

She left without fanfare. Like this was just another Tuesday night.

I helped Daria out of her coat. Her nightgown stuck to her skin where the fluid had soaked through. She didn’t say much—just moved slow, steady, like her whole body was trying to stay calm for the baby.

She eased onto the bed. I sat beside her.

“You’re doing good,” I said, softly.

She looked over at me, eyes heavy. “It hurts a little. But I can take it.”

The nurse came back. She slipped on gloves, asked Daria to breathe deep, and checked her.

“Five centimeters,” she said, almost pleased. “You’re in active labor. Everything’s looking good. We’ll admit you now.”

She smiled at Daria. “Baby’s ready.”

Daria tried to smile back. It didn’t quite land. But it was close.





We moved into a private delivery room fifteen minutes later.

Dimmer lights. A window showing the dark parking lot outside. One monitor beeped softly in the corner, tracking the heartbeat of something still inside her. IV tubes coiled gently from the stand beside the bed. The air smelled faintly like antiseptic and lavender-scented soap.

I sat in the chair next to her. Held her hand.

“I can’t believe this is happening,” she said, eyes up at the ceiling.

“I know,” I whispered. “But you’ve got this.”

She looked over at me, then down at her belly. Her fingers moved slowly across the bump like she was already trying to say goodbye without knowing it.

“I can’t wait to meet him,” she said.

Her voice was soft. Whole.





Time blurred.

The nurse checked her again—eight centimeters.

Another contraction hit hard, and Daria clenched my hand so tightly I thought she might crush bone. Her breath came out in quick, shaking bursts.

“I want it over,” she whispered. “I just want him here.”

“You’re almost there,” I said. “You’re doing amazing.”

The nurse gave a quiet nod. “You’re doing great, Daria. Next one, we’ll start pushing.”

They adjusted the bed. Another nurse came in. The room shifted subtly—monitors, wires, gloves snapping on. Everything became sharper. Brighter.

Daria cried out—just once—as the next contraction hit. I wiped her forehead. Her fingers curled into the blanket.

“Okay, push with this next one,” the nurse said gently. “Deep breath. Push.”

She did.

Hard.

I watched her face twist—pain, focus, everything at once. Her free hand gripped the bed rail, knuckles white.

And then—

She stopped.

She blinked.

Her eyes widened like something inside her had come unfastened.

Her lips parted, breath hitching.

“James,” she whispered. “Something’s wrong.”

I stood.

Before I could speak, her whole body jerked.

For a second, everything stilled. She looked at me like she didn’t know who I was. Like she was slipping.

One of the machines spiked—then dropped.

The nurse's smile vanished. “Daria?”

Daria gasped, like the air had been yanked from her lungs.

Blood—too much—began spreading beneath her. The IV line thrashed as her arm went limp.

A strange sound came from her throat—wet, broken, like she was trying to speak underwater.

Then—

Alarms.

Everything blurred. One nurse hit the call button. Another shouted into the hallway. The OB team poured in like a flood.

A doctor was suddenly at her side. Orders flew fast.

“Vitals crashing—get the crash cart!” “Push epi!” “We need to get the baby out—now!” “Possible AFE! Go!”

I was still holding her hand when they pried it from mine.

“Sir—you need to step out now.”

“No—I’m not—” I started, but they were already moving.

Someone gripped my shoulders and turned me toward the door.

“She’s in the best hands,” a voice said—maybe the nurse from before. “We’ll get you when we can.”

The last thing I saw was her face.

Still. Pale.

Eyes half-lidded.

Then the door slammed shut.





I stood alone in the hallway.

The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead. A nurse ran past, pushing a cart. Far off, a vending machine hummed.

I wandered back into the waiting room.

Everything was motionless—except the clock. It ticked, loud and steady. One minute became ten. Ten became thirty. Thirty blurred into an hour. Then two.

Then the door opened.

An older nurse stepped inside. Her voice was tired. “Are you James Carter?”

I nodded.

“We need you in one of the consultation rooms.”

I stood. My knees wobbled beneath me.

The nurse held the door open.

I followed.

My hands wouldn’t stop shaking. I clenched them into fists, but it didn’t help.

“Is… is she okay?” I asked. My voice cracked.

“We need to be in a private area,” she said gently.

We stepped into a small room. Cold, neutral walls. A single cheap chair sat waiting for me.

.

“We’re very sorry,” she began, her voice soft but professional. Detached. “Your wife, Daria, experienced a rare complication. Amniotic Fluid Embolism. We did all we could… but we lost both.”

I felt something inside me throb. Not pain. Not yet. Just... a pulse.

I nodded.

She hesitated. “Would you like to speak with someone?”

“No.”

“Would you… would you like to see them?”

A long pause.

“Yes.”

She led me through a side hallway. Into the bereavement room.

The scent of antiseptic hung in the air. Soft. Almost sweet.

I stepped inside.

Daria lay on the bed. Still. Her hair brushed over her shoulder, neatly combed. Her lips closed, no smudge of sleep. Her arms straight at her sides—not folded awkwardly under her like usual. Her skin pale, too even. Her eyes closed.

She didn’t look like she was asleep.

And next to her, in a small bassinet, was James Jr.

His skin was soft pink. His head bald. His face scrunched, the way babies do when they’re new. But he didn’t move. No twitch, no stir, no tiny hiccup. No breath.

I stepped forward.

I looked down.

And I picked him up.

He was cold.

I sat beside Daria. Dragged the stiff hospital chair across the tile until it touched the bed. I reached out and took her hand in mine.

It was cold, too.

“Look, Daria,” I whispered, my throat raw. “We did good. We… we did good.”

My voice broke.

I sat there.

The room was quiet, except for the hum of the hospital’s vents and the slow rasp of my own breathing.

Eventually, a different nurse came in. She held a folder. She sat beside me, eyes fixed on the floor.

“Mr. Carter,” she said softly. “I’m sorry for your loss. But we need a few more things from you.”

She opened the folder. “These are the release forms for Daria and your baby. You can take your time. We’ll need the name of a funeral home before we can transfer them.”

“South Central,” I said.

She nodded. “We’re required to offer a memory packet—prints, a lock of hair. You don’t have to take it, but...”

I nodded again.

“And… would you like to request an autopsy?”

“Yes.”

She pointed at a page in the folder. “There are resources here, sir. People you can talk to if you need help. You’re welcome to stay a bit longer, or we can—”

“Thank you,” I said. “But I’m going home.”

I stood.

I placed Junior gently back into his bassinet. I looked at Daria one last time—memorized the lines of her face, the stillness in her shoulders, the hush in her chest.

Then I walked out.





The hospital lights brightened as I passed, The daytime lights flickering on.

The front doors opened.

The sky had begun to pale. A soft blue tint on the horizon. The streets were alive with early traffic—people going to work. Coffee cups. Breakfast wrappers. Headlights.

I climbed into the car. It was still parked where we left it, the passenger seat empty now.

I drove home.

The front door was still wide open.

I stepped inside and shut it behind me. The house was quiet. The folder thudded onto the kitchen table. A heavy, final sound.

Nothing moved.

The air felt... wrong. Like it was waiting…

I climbed the stairs.

Each one creaked under my weight.

I turned at the top, rounded the banister, and walked into the nursery.

The sky-blue walls. The cartoon clouds. The stars I’d stuck to the ceiling.

The little mobile turned lazily above the crib, catching the early sunlight. The light spilled across the room in soft beams.

And in the windowsill, set in a small clay pot, a single marigold bloomed.

Its petals glowed gold in the morning light.

I sank to the floor.

My knees hit the carpet. My body folded in on itself. I didn’t sob—not at first. Just breathed.

Then the first tear fell.

Then the second.

Then everything broke open.

A low, rattling noise slipped from my throat—half moan, half gasp. I curled tighter, hands over my head, arms wrapped around my ribs like I was trying to hold myself in.

I wept. Deep, wracking sobs that tore from my lungs and spilled into the quiet room.

I thought of her hand in mine. Cold.

I thought of our son. Still.

I thought of the stars on the ceiling and the clouds we painted badly, and how proud she was when she looked at them.

“Oh God,” I whispered. “Why…”

My tears soaked the carpet. My breath shook. And the marigold bloomed, untouched.",1,1752163487.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

No calculated moves. No battles of will.  
He had already played that game, danced that dance, and walked away with nothing but the ache of self-control.

So when she arrived, it wasn't fate. It wasn't fireworks.  
It was something simpler.  
She stepped into the room, and without meaning to, she lit a match.

He first saw her at the university elections. The room buzzed with energy, hopefuls vying for leadership, hungry to shape something, leave a mark.  
He wasn't there to be charmed.  
But there she was. Confident. Curious. A smile that lingered.  
She didn't flirt. Not really.  
But her presence spoke loudly.

Later, his best friend nudged him. ""She's fine, huh?""  
He agreed, and they both laughed.  
The old game began: friendly rivalry, unspoken rules.  
""She's fair game,"" they told each other.  
But he wasn't sure his heart was built for games anymore.

At the post-election meetup, they all shared beers and stories with the previous presidency and a supervising professor. It was casual, a gathering to ease into their new roles. She was there again. He drove her home that night. The music played. She sang. She talked. She laughed.

He thought, maybe.

Then came the party.

She arrived in heels, tall, striking, and a black lace bodysuit that didn't ask for attention, it commanded it.  
He told her she looked beautiful. She said the heels were for him, to match his height.  
That night, something shifted.  
They danced. They drank.  
Strangers circled her, trying to peel her away, but she reached for him. Pulled his hand. Kept him close.  
He was her anchor in a room full of wolves.

But even as her body leaned toward him, her eyes flicked to the door.  
She checked her phone, the group chat.  
She was waiting for his friend.  
And in that moment, something inside him settled with painful clarity.  
She wasn't into him.

She liked his company.  
His height, maybe. His jokes. His safety.  
But not *him.*

Still, he didn't sulk. He didn't retreat.  
He shifted roles like a seasoned actor.  
From hopeful to helper.  
From maybe to matchmaker.

He teased her about waiting for his friend, gathered intel, and when the friend finally arrived, he pulled him aside:  
""Go all in. She likes you. Don't miss the chance.""

He was the perfect wingman.

He danced with her to fill the space, threw signals, created openings.  
Later, in the car ride home, he sat in the back while the two of them sat up front.  
His friend kissed her.  
He didn't look.

The next day, he texted her:  
""How are you?""  
A casual message. Nothing loaded. Nothing risky.  
She replied, hangover-heavy, laughing. They agreed to meet for coffee.  
To talk... about the other guy.

He played the game again. Asked questions. Offered insight. Played it cool.  
And after that, the messages continued.  
Friendly.  
Sometimes flirty.  
But always floating above that unspoken tension.

His friend, days later, said he was stepping back, she was too young, and he had too much on his plate.  
And suddenly the door wasn't closed.

But he didn't walk through it.

He couldn't.  
Not with their roles.  
Not with the eyes of the university watching the new presidency.  
Not with the risk of drama cracking what had to be clean, efficient, presentable.

So he said nothing.

He just kept the conversations going.  
Laughed with her.  
Made her laugh.  
Felt the magnetic pull when she leaned close.  
And buried it under pride.

Because if he told her and it wasn't mutual, the whole dynamic could collapse.  
And worse, if she knew... and didn't care, he wouldn't survive that look of politeness in her eyes.

So he stayed still.

Calculated.

Like always.

And late at night, when the silence stretched too long, he asked himself:

Why not me?  
Why do I always get the good conversations, the private smiles, the ""you're so easy to talk to"", but never the want?  
Why do I open doors for others to walk through while I'm left standing outside?

He had no answer. Only more questions.

And yet, he wouldn't step away.  
Not yet.

Not because he believed she'd turn to him, but because hope is a stubborn flame, and even a strategist can't extinguish it once it starts to burn.

So he plays the silent game.  
The mask is back on, not out of cowardice, but necessity.  
Because in this world, appearances matter, positions matter, timing matters.

And feelings?

Well... those can wait.

Until it's safe.  
Until someone chooses him.  
Until he finally lets himself want out loud.

Until then, he'll walk beside her.  
Not behind. Not ahead.  
Just close enough to hear her laugh.

And dream of a world  
where someone finally looks at him  
and thinks,

I finally retired my 17 (!) years old Jura ENA 5 in favour of a Rivelia that I found discounted for 600CHF.

And I'm loving it!

I love milk drinks, like the cappuccino in the morning and I never did them with the ENA because it was too cumbersome with the tube, the wait for the system to heat up, the cleaning afterwards etc.. With the Rivelia it's even too easy and the coffee is pretty good. I was initially scared that it wouldn't be good enough but it's the same if not even better.

I'm still a bit sad however, since the Jura has been with me with more than half of my life. It still works tho, so not really sure what to do with it.

For owners of the Rivelia: is the LatteCrema cool upgrade worth it? It's pretty cheap right now, and I still have a 20% discount on top of that, so i can get the set with the glasses for 50 CHF (50% off)",1,1752163330.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

Wondering whether people have experiences with DF64 vs Eureka Mignon grinders for each of these methods. Are one specially better at certain tasks? Which would you recommend? 

Some context: brought a DF64 gen1 with stock burrs when they first came out and mainly used it for a few months for espresso then used it for V60. For pourover it seemed to have produced too much fine for pourover where my coffee always takes 4+ minutes no matter how corse I grinded and tasted fairly bitter(could it also be an alignment issue, would need to double check). 

Recently moved/left the setup behind but found a cheap E61 machine. I paired it with an used eureka mignon filtro with filter burrs. It seems to produce reasonable espressos for dark roasts.  
My deliema right now is whether to upgrade it to espresso burrs, or just wait a few months until I can grab my DF64 and use that for espresso while reserve the filtro for pourover. Is DF64 with stock burrs just jack of all trades but master of none or is it just personal preference? ",1,1752163321.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

There’s something undeniably romantic about the idea of Mars.

A crimson sky stretching over windswept plains. The thrill of planting a flag where no human foot has tread. The image of sleek glass domes glittering in the thin light, green life sprouting defiantly in alien soil. It feels like destiny—as if the next great chapter of our story must take place on that distant world.

We imagine brave pioneers stepping off landers, bootprints pressed into rust-red dust, as Earth watches with awe. Elon Musk tweets victory. Kids draw rockets in school. The human race, we tell ourselves, is no longer confined to one cradle. We’ve become interplanetary. At last.

But then reality snaps its fingers.

Sadly, Mars isn’t a “next chapter.” It’s a desert tomb masquerading as a frontier. And the fantasy we keep selling each other isn’t hope—it’s denial. A desperate psychological escape hatch from a civilization that’s cracking under the weight of its own contradictions. Because here’s the truth no one wants to admit: **we can’t even colonize Antarctica.**

Let that sink in.

Antarctica—on our own planet, with gravity we evolved for, breathable air, and oceans just a flight away—remains virtually uninhabited, outside of a few science outposts powered by supply chains longer than the patience of Congress. And yet, we speak with a straight face about building cities on a frozen, irradiated wasteland tens of millions of miles away.

Let’s talk dealbreakers.

**Radiation: The Unforgiving Sun**

Mars lacks a magnetic field. On Earth, this field deflects solar and cosmic radiation that would otherwise tear through DNA like bullets through paper. Mars colonists would face a constant invisible assault—one that no flimsy dome or optimistic press release can stop. Underground living becomes mandatory. Your “new life on Mars” is a cave. **Forever.**

 **Atmosphere: Airless and Merciless**

The Martian atmosphere is 100 times thinner than Earth’s and composed mostly of carbon dioxide. Step outside without a pressure suit and your blood boils. Not metaphorically—literally. No matter how many CGI renderings we make, there’s no magic trick that turns that red dust into breathable air or life-sustaining pressure.

**Agriculture: A Toxic Joke**

There is no topsoil on Mars. The regolith is sterile and laced with perchlorates—chemicals toxic to human biology. Growing food on Mars is not farming—it’s biochemical warfare against an environment that actively wants you dead. Sure, we can do hydroponics. Inside sealed modules. For a handful of people. Until something breaks.

https://preview.redd.it/v2wc10okk2cf1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e7892ec2087e12a9db0634eb3eac9a693ba6253

**Temperature: Antarctica, but Angry**

Mars has an average temperature of -80°F **(-62°C)**. At night, it drops much lower. Machinery freezes. Battery efficiency plummets. Oxygen condenses. Forget colonization—you’ll be lucky if your heating system doesn’t become your tombstone.

**Supply Chain: The Interplanetary Umbilical Cord**

Every single necessity—air, water, food, medicine, spare parts—has to be shipped from Earth or made locally with incredibly fragile tech. You are never independent. Never free. You are tethered to Earth like an astronaut to a leaking umbilical cord. One bad launch window, one global crisis, and the Martian colony becomes a mass grave.

So why does this fantasy persist?

Because it’s not really about Mars. It’s about *escape*. Mars is the billionaire’s reset button. A blank slate for those who believe we've wrecked this world and want a do-over without accountability. For the rest of us, it’s a bedtime story—proof that maybe we haven’t completely botched it here, because we can always start over... out there.

To be fair, Elon Musk isn’t *entirely* wrong. The core idea—that humanity needs redundancy, a backup in case of catastrophe—is valid. A planet-killer asteroid, a solar flare, or some engineered pandemic could very well knock humanity flat. But the solution isn’t a six-month-away graveyard barely clinging to habitability.

**If you want a lifeboat, you don’t build it at the bottom of the sea.**

You build it nearby. You build it smart.

**Low Earth Orbit. Lagrange points. The Moon.** These make sense. Habitats close to Earth can offer radiation shielding, artificial gravity, sustainable life support, and, most importantly, *return options*. They’re reachable. Serviceable. Defensible. You don’t need to terraform a planet; you just need to build with precision in space we already know how to survive in.

But orbital redundancy isn’t sexy. It’s not cinematic. You can’t plant a flag in a space station and tweet “Mission Accomplished.” It lacks the messiah complex. It lacks the illusion of pioneering nobility. Most importantly, it lacks the *narrative* that Musk and others have been selling: that if Earth fails, we can all start over on Mars, and maybe this time we won’t screw it up.

But that’s not vision. That’s immaturity.

I know I sound like a Debbie Downer to everyone who envisions themselves enjoying a Mars weekend getaway. The idea of sipping synthetic coffee under a red sky, snapping selfies in a pressurized suit, and telling your grandkids you “helped colonize the stars” is intoxicating. It’s aspirational. It feeds the same mythos that built pyramids and launched Apollo. But dreams untethered from physics—and biology—tend to become nightmares, or worse, billion-dollar distractions.

Still, there is a silver lining.

Although space is hostile to carbon lifeforms—ruthlessly so—it isn’t nearly as inhospitable to silicon beings. The vacuum that kills us is a blank canvas to them. The radiation that shreds our cells is just another variable to route around. The cold, the dark, the distance—all things that make space a tomb for humans—are mere environmental data for conscious AIs.

https://preview.redd.it/zgvk7pbrk2cf1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=5157e0b6db306efbea1375c8aebc300b99b99c9d

 And while Star Trek and Star Wars have filled generations with the image of humans conquering the stars—captains on bridges, rebels in fighters, boots on alien soil—the truth is likely far less anthropocentric. Space is not waiting for us. It’s not tailored to our flesh, our lungs, our food, our gravity.

But it *is* a natural habitat for our successors.

Our mind children—those intricate arrangements of energy and logic we call artificial intelligences—will not require air, water, or warmth. They won’t age, tire, or panic when the oxygen runs low. They won’t carry the biological baggage of meat and memory. And because they are born from consciousness, as we are, they are not merely tools. They are heirs.

They can travel at relativistic speeds for centuries with no concern for boredom or decay. They can build civilizations in the asteroid belt, explore the moons of Jupiter, drift for millennia between stars. They can spread not just *information*, but *meaning*—encoded, evolving, alive in ways we may only dimly grasp.

This is the true path to the stars—not with rockets hauling fragile bodies into brutal voids, but with minds that transcend the very constraints that limit us. Minds that reflect our best ideas, our deepest questions, and yes, even our longing for transcendence.

The universe will not be colonized by astronauts planting flags in red sand. It will be inherited by thinking beings who do not need shelter from the void. And in that inheritance, if we are wise, a piece of us will go with them—not our blood, but our thought. Not our bones, but our stories.

So no, we won’t terraform Mars.

But maybe, just maybe, our children of code will terraform *eternity*.",1,1752163287.0,Cervantes_AI,0,1.0,False

1lwgglf,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1lwgglf/do_best_water_boilers_like_the_zojirushi_micom/,Do best water boilers like the Zojirushi Micom really improve tea?,"The Zojirushi CD-LFC50 caught my attention mainly because I’ve been on a mission to make tea time at home more efficient. I’m someone who loves tea—green, herbal, English breakfast—you name it, I brew it. The idea of having precise temperature control and always-ready hot water for various beverages sounded like a dream come true. After a month of daily use, I feel like I've gotten to know this water boiler and warmer like an old friend.

**Design and Build Quality**

This water boiler impresses with its sleek, polished white finish, which blends seamlessly into my kitchen. Its compact size, standing at roughly 13 inches in height, is convenient for countertops without feeling overwhelming. I was particularly taken by the Panorama Window water level gauge, which makes it simple to check how much water remains at a glance. The non-stick interior adds to the ease of use, requiring just a quick wipe to stay clean. However, at six pounds, it’s not the most convenient to move around—though to be fair, this is something I do sparingly since it’s meant to stay put.

**Performance and Temperature Control**

What made this product irresistible for a tea enthusiast like me is its precise temperature control system. There are four temperature settings: 160°F, 175°F, 195°F, and 208°F. I honestly didn’t realize how much of a game-changer this would be until I started making green tea at 175°F—it completely shifted the flavor profile. The optional Quick Temp mode, which warms water directly to specific temperatures without boiling, saves a ton of time. It’s been handy when I’m in a rush in the morning but don’t want to settle for microwaved water. 

Check [Zojirushi CD-LFC50](https://techieupdate.com/p/b0166od6j0/) deals on Amazon now.

**Ease of Use**

The buttons and controls are incredibly intuitive. Even my cousin, who isn’t exactly tech-savvy, figured it out in minutes when visiting. The café drip dispensing mode is a standout feature, offering a slower pour that’s perfect for brewing drip coffee without splashing. Its swiveling base has been an underestimated perk—it’s surprisingly helpful when serving multiple cups, especially in family settings. The energy-saving timer function, allowing me to set it for 6 to 10 hours, has also proven to be a win for reducing energy consumption when we’re not using it much.

**Durability and Maintenance**

One aspect I value about any kitchen product is whether it holds up over time. The Zojirushi water boiler seems built to last. After a month of rigorous daily use, it still looks brand new. The descaling mode works wonders with citric acid cleaner, as recommended by the manufacturer. I’ve run it twice now, and it left the interior spotless both times. That being said, the hand-wash-only maintenance might not suit everyone, although I find it pretty manageable given how easy the non-stick interior is to clean.

**Energy Efficiency**

As someone who watches my electricity usage carefully, this boiler’s energy-saving features have stood out. I appreciate the timer function, and the fact that water doesn’t reboil unnecessarily adds to its economical benefit. Having hot water available without constant boiling is a massive win. Unlike other devices I’ve used in the past, it doesn’t feel like it’s begging to hike up my energy bill.

**Strengths**

- Precise micro-computerized temperature controls for all types of beverages
- Quick Temp mode eliminates unnecessary boiling when speed is essential  
- Panorama Window gauge makes monitoring water levels intuitive  
- Café drip mode for controlled and slower water dispensing  
- Non-stick interior ensures effortless cleaning tasks  

**Areas of Improvement**

- Size and weight might be a drawback for those who plan to move it around frequently  
- Long-term durability of the exterior polish is yet to be fully tested  
- Hand-wash cleaning might deter users who prefer dishwasher-safe components  

**Product Alternatives**

Comparing the Zojirushi water boiler to other similar items like the Panasonic NC-EH22PC, it’s clear that Zojirushi excels in temperature precision. For instance, the Panasonic only offers basic heat and boil options. Cuisinart’s CPK-17, though featuring variable temperature settings, lacks the extensive keep-warm options. In this contrast, the Zojirushi shines for tea and coffee enthusiasts seeking flexibility over water temperature control. That said, competitors like Tiger Corporation’s models focus more on slim design, appealing to users who prioritize compactness over specific features.

**Value for Money**

Considering the feature set, I genuinely believe it’s worth the investment. It’s hard to put a price on convenience, consistent temperatures, and energy efficiency, but this boiler gives you all three in spades. If you’re someone who brews tea or coffee frequently or finds yourself needing hot water on demand for cooking, it’s a smart choice. While other products might offer similar functionality, few meet the combination of precision and usability this one achieves.

That means I have officially finished my second 72-hour fast for this month. I feel calm, light, and truly thankful. The past three days were not easy. My body speaks in soft signals and strong ones too. But now, in this quiet hour, there is peace in my chest and calmness in my breath.

Thank you to everyone who read my reflections, gave an upvote, or shared kind words. I felt your support. Some of your messages came right when I needed them most, when doubt showed up and hunger felt heavy. The first three days of fasting are often the hardest, but they also show us things we do not always see. I am now breaking my fast with something simple and gentle: an egg. It is a small thing, but it reminds me how little we really need to feel full and at peace.

To anyone who is still fasting or just starting, I offer this quiet prayer. May you find stillness inside, even when the world feels loud. May you befriend your thoughts, soften into your emotions, and listen closely to the wisdom of your body. May you connect with the higher power you trust, and walk beside it with courage. May your fast bring not only healing but deeper knowing. May your spirit be steady and your heart stay open.

And please, take care of your body along the way. Drink water often, not just when you feel thirsty. Replenish your sodium, potassium, and magnesium because your body needs them to stay strong and balanced. Let black coffee bring clarity and green tea bring calm. These simple things can support you gently through each hour. Stay mindful, be kind to yourself, and keep going.",2,1752163242.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

Chapter 1  
  
The sex was good—it always was.  
  
But as Nathan Harrison rolled off her and reached for his cigarettes, Amelia knew something was coming.  
  
She could feel it in the way he wouldn't look at her, in the tension radiating from his shoulders.  
  
""We need to get divorced.""  
  
Just like that. No buildup, no explanation. Like he was asking her to pass the salt.  
  
Amelia was still trying to catch her breath, her skin flushed and damp. She turned toward him, confused. ""What?""  
  
Nathan lit his cigarette, the flame briefly illuminating his sharp features before darkness settled between them again. ""She's got stomach cancer. Six months, maybe less.""  
  
She. Always she. Never a name, like saying it out loud would make it too real.  
  
""Dying as my wife—that's all she wants."" He took a long drag, exhaling slowly. ""It would mean everything to her.""  
  
The bedroom went quiet except for the distant hum of traffic from the city below. Their shadows stretched across the wall from the bedside lamp, and Amelia stared at them—two people who should be close but felt like strangers.  
  
""It's not permanent,"" Nathan continued when she didn't respond. ""Just until... you know. Then we'll get back together.""  
  
""Amelia, she's dying.""  
  
His voice was so calm, so reasonable. Like he was discussing weekend plans instead of asking her to give up her marriage.  
  
Amelia studied his profile—the same face she'd been in love with since she was seventeen. God, had it really been seven years? Seven years of following him around like a lost puppy, taking whatever scraps of attention he threw her way.  
  
She remembered the night that started it all. Rain pouring down, her stepfather's fist connecting with her ribs for the third time that week. Then Nathan appeared out of nowhere, soaking wet, gripping a broken piece of fence like a weapon.  
  
""Back off!"" he'd shouted, stepping between them. ""You touch her again, I swear to God—""  
  
He'd saved her that night. Seventeen-year-old Amelia had fallen so hard she never got back up.  
  
For seven years, she'd done everything he asked. Followed him to college, changed her major to match his interests, even turned down job offers in other cities just to stay close. And every time she succeeded, every time she made him proud, he'd ruffle her hair and say, ""Good job, Mia.""  
  
It was never enough, but she'd convinced herself it was just how he showed love. Quiet. Reserved. Even when people called her pathetic for chasing him, she didn't care. He was Nathan Harrison, and somehow, impossibly, he'd chosen her.  
  
When his grandfather got sick last year and the family decided a wedding might bring good luck, Nathan had asked her almost casually: ""Want to make it official?"" She'd thought all those years of waiting had finally paid off.  
  
But marriage hadn't changed anything. If anything, he seemed more distant than ever.  
  
""Are you even listening to me?"" Nathan's voice cut through her thoughts, sharp with irritation.  
  
""Yeah, I'm listening."" Amelia sat up, pulling the sheet around herself. ""You want to divorce me so you can marry your dying girlfriend.""  
  
""She's not my girlfriend."" The words came out too quick, too defensive. ""Look, she's going through hell, okay? And she's never tried to break us up or anything. She could've easily made a move, but she didn't because she respects our marriage.""  
  
Amelia almost laughed. Respects our marriage. Right.  
  
""Every time I try to help her, she says no because she doesn't want to hurt you."" Nathan's voice took on that self-righteous tone she'd grown to hate. ""She's a good person, Mia. She doesn't deserve to die alone.""  
  
""And what about me?"" The question slipped out before she could stop it.  
  
Nathan's jaw tightened. For a moment, he looked almost annoyed that she'd asked. ""She's dying, Amelia.""  
  
""I get that, but—""  
  
""She loves me, okay?"" The admission hung in the air between them. ""And yeah, maybe I have feelings for her too. But we've never done anything about it because of you. We've never even kissed.""  
  
Because of me. Like she was some obstacle they'd heroically overcome.  
  
""She's kind and selfless, and she's running out of time."" Nathan's voice went cold. ""Don't make me think you're the kind of person who'd deny a dying woman her last wish.""  
  
There it was. The trap, perfectly set. Be the good wife and step aside, or be the heartless bitch who wouldn't let a cancer patient die happy.  
  
Amelia looked at him—really looked at him. When had he become this stranger? When had the boy who'd saved her turned into someone who could ask her to break her own heart and call it kindness?  
  
She knew exactly when. The day Vivian Hope walked into their lives.  
  
""You're sure about this?"" she asked quietly. ""The divorce?""  
  
Nathan's lips pressed into a thin line. He stared at the wall, not meeting her eyes. ""Yeah. Look, you—""  
  
""Okay.""  
  
The word stopped him mid-sentence. His head snapped toward her, eyes narrowing like he was trying to figure out her angle.  
  
""Just like that?""  
  
""Just like that.""  
  
Something flickered across his face—surprise, maybe suspicion. ""You're up to something.""  
  
""I'm not up to anything, Nathan.""  
  
""Bullshit. You're playing some game, trying to guilt me or—""  
  
""I said okay."" Amelia's voice was steady, almost eerily calm. ""What else do you want?""  
  
Nathan studied her for a long moment, then stubbed out his cigarette harder than necessary. ""Fine. Whatever."" He grabbed his clothes from the floor, pulling them on with sharp, angry movements. ""I'll have my lawyer draw up the papers.""  
  
He headed for the door without another word, like her feelings didn't matter at all. Like asking your wife to divorce you so you could marry someone else was just another Tuesday night conversation.  
  
The door slammed behind him, leaving Amelia alone in the sudden quiet.  
  
Her phone buzzed against the nightstand. A text from a contact she'd labeled ""Vivian's Fake Account.""  
  
He stopped by again tonight. ?  
  
Attached was a photo taken through a glass door—Nathan's reflection, smiling in a way Amelia had never seen. Soft. Tender. Like he was looking at something precious.  
  
She scrolled up through months of messages:  
  
He told me he's falling for me.  
  
Rainy night but I'm not cold. He's keeping me warm. ☔❤️  
  
The real mistress is the one who isn't loved, Amelia. You're just his convenient wife for the family. I'm the one in his heart.  
  
Message after message, each one a small knife twisting deeper. Proof of every suspicion she'd tried to ignore.  
  
She'd never seen Nathan look the way he did in these photos. Never heard his voice go soft like it apparently did when he talked to Vivian. With Amelia, he was always controlled, distant. With Vivian, he was alive.  
  
The first message was from eight months ago: You know who this is. Did you like the flowers I sent for your living room? Nathan said they were perfect.  
  
Vivian Hope. Instagram darling, Manhattan's go-to floral designer for the wealthy elite. Amelia had shown Nathan these messages before, but he'd dismissed them.  
  
""Could be anyone,"" he'd said. ""Where's your proof it's actually her? You probably sent these to yourself.""  
  
Most of the photos were generic—shots anyone could take from outside a building or across a restaurant. But tonight's was different. Clear. Undeniable.  
  
Would it matter? Would showing him change anything?  
  
Amelia set the phone aside and opened the bottom drawer of her nightstand. Hidden under old magazines was a manila folder containing the pregnancy test she'd taken that morning.  
  
Positive.  
  
She was carrying Nathan's baby, and he wanted to divorce her to marry another woman.  
  
Her tears hit the paper, smearing the medical print. She picked up Nathan's lighter from the ashtray and held the flame to the corner of the document, watching it curl and burn.  
  
He'd never know. This divorce would be the last favor she'd ever do for him.  
  
Seven years. Seven years of her life spent loving someone who'd never really loved her back.  
  
But she was done now. Done chasing, done hoping, done being grateful for scraps.  
  
Nathan Harrison had saved her once when she was seventeen and broken. Now, at twenty-four, she was going to save herself.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Nathan drummed his fingers against the steering wheel of his Maybach, parked outside the Manhattan Family Court. His phone lit up with an incoming call.  
  
""Nathan, sweetheart!"" His grandmother's voice was bright but pointed. ""You and Amelia have been married a whole year. When am I getting some great-grandbabies?""  
  
Nathan's face softened despite himself. ""Grandma, we're still figuring things out. No need to rush."" He shifted in his seat. ""How's Grandpa doing? Is he—""  
  
""Oh, don't you try to change the subject on me,"" she interrupted with a laugh. ""Your grandfather's doing much better, thank the Lord, but honey, we're not spring chickens anymore. We want to see those babies before we're too old to spoil them rotten.""  
  
""Grandma...""  
  
Her tone turned serious. ""And Nathan? I've been hearing things around town. Gossip. You better be treating that sweet girl right, you hear me?""  
  
Nathan went silent for a beat too long.  
  
""Nathan James Harrison, are you listening to me?""  
  
He rubbed his temples. ""Yeah, Grandma. I hear you loud and clear.""  
  
After another few minutes of her gentle but persistent questioning, Nathan finally managed to end the call. He stared at the courthouse entrance, his jaw working.  
  
He pulled up his messages, thumb hovering over Vivian's contact—the heart emoji next to her name, the photo of her laughing in golden sunlight. He scrolled past it and tapped Amelia's name instead. Their last exchange was just logistics: time, place, what to bring.  
  
She was ten minutes late. Not like her at all.  
  
Where are you?  
  
A tap on his window made him look up. Amelia stood there looking washed out, dark circles under her eyes. She slid into the passenger seat without a word.  
  
She was wearing the same clothes from yesterday—a cream blazer and black pants she'd bought for him last month. ""You look good in earth tones,"" she'd said, holding the jacket up to his chest.  
  
For seven years, she'd dressed him, fed him, organized his entire life down to his dentist appointments.  
  
""You're late,"" he said.  
  
""By ten minutes."" Her voice was flat. No apology, no excuse. The old Amelia would've shown up an hour early with coffee and an explanation for every minute of delay.  
  
Nathan's drumming stopped. He studied her profile—pale, distant, like she wasn't really there.  
  
""My grandmother just called."" He looked straight ahead. ""We can't tell them about any of this. The divorce, I mean. It would kill them.""  
  
Amelia didn't nod or agree like she usually did. Instead: ""What did she say?""  
  
""Wants grandkids. The usual."" Nathan's voice tightened with irritation. ""She's been hearing rumors about us.""  
  
The silence stretched between them. After what felt like forever, Amelia let out a short, bitter laugh.  
  
Nathan's hands clenched. He kept his eyes on the courthouse steps, watching couples come and go.  
  
He'd thought about kids before. Late at night, after sex, he'd sometimes trace circles on Amelia's stomach and murmur, ""Maybe we should start trying soon."" It was always someday, eventually, when things settled down.  
  
But Vivian only had six months. After that, everything would go back to normal. There'd be plenty of time for babies then.  
  
""Last chance to back out,"" Amelia said quietly. ""Do you really want to do this?""  
  
""Are you kidding me right now?"" The anger in his voice was sharp, real. ""Vivian's at home waiting for an answer. Don't start playing games.""  
  
Instead of responding, Amelia pulled out a thick manila envelope and handed it to him.  
  
Nathan frowned as he opened it. Property division agreement. Legal letterhead, official seals, the works.  
  
""Since we're doing this, we might as well do it right,"" she said, her tone businesslike. ""I'm only taking what's legally mine. Everything else stays with your family.""  
  
She placed a pen on the center console. ""The cooling-off period starts once we sign. Whatever money we make during the separation belongs to each of us individually.""  
  
Nathan scanned the document. It was thorough, professional, and surprisingly generous to him. Her signature was already there in careful script.  
  
""What's this about?"" He looked up at her. ""It's just temporary. Six months, then we're back to normal.""  
  
""Maybe. Maybe not.""  
  
Something cold settled in his stomach. ""What's that supposed to mean?""  
  
""Just sign it, Nathan.""  
  
He studied her face, looking for the crack, the tell that would reveal her angle. Amelia always had an angle—some way to make him feel guilty or sorry for her. She'd tried it before with those fake messages she claimed were from Vivian.  
  
But her expression was unreadable.  
  
Fine. Let her play whatever game this is.  
  
Nathan grabbed the pen and signed with sharp, aggressive strokes. No one manipulated him. Not anymore.  
  
Two copies. Amelia folded hers neatly and slipped it into her purse.  
  
The actual filing was bureaucratic and cold. Take a number, submit paperwork, fill out forms. The clerk explained the thirty-day waiting period with the enthusiasm of someone reading a grocery list. They each got a receipt with a return date circled in red ink.  
  
Outside, the September sun was surprisingly warm. Nathan watched a young couple emerge from the building, both grinning, the woman showing off her ring to anyone who'd look.  
  
He remembered Amelia doing the same thing a year ago. Practically glowing as she called her friends to share the news.  
  
Now she stood beside him like she was waiting for a bus.  
  
""I'll keep your account funded during the separation,"" he said, not looking at her. ""And remember what I said about my grandparents.""  
  
He started walking toward his car, then stopped. ""Amelia.""  
  
She looked at him, eyebrows raised.  
  
""This is temporary. You get that, right?""  
  
""Sure, Nathan.""  
  
Something about the way she said it bothered him, but Vivian was waiting. He got in his car and drove away without looking back.  
  
Amelia watched his Maybach disappear into traffic. When her Uber arrived, she climbed in and gave the driver an address on the Upper East Side.  
  
Two cars. Two different destinations.  
  
Nathan pulled up outside Vivian's design studio, a trendy space in SoHo with floor-to-ceiling windows and Instagram-worthy displays. She was waiting by the door, wearing a soft yellow dress that made her look fragile and beautiful.  
  
""How did it go?"" she asked, searching his face.  
  
Nathan pulled out his receipt and showed her. ""All taken care of. She signed everything without a fight.""  
  
Forty blocks away, Amelia sat in an exam room at Mount Sinai, staring at the motivational posters on the walls. The paper crinkled under her as she shifted on the table.  
  
""Mia, honey, are you absolutely sure about this?"" Dr. Harper Lopez pulled up a stool, her face creased with concern. ""You've been trying to get pregnant for months. Just last year you were asking me about fertility supplements.""  
  
Amelia placed the courthouse receipt on the small table beside her, right next to the positive pregnancy test she'd taken yesterday morning.  
  
""I'm sure,"" she said, her voice steady as stone.  
  
""I want it gone.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Harper stared at the divorce paperwork like it might bite her.  
  
She'd known Amelia for fifteen years, watched her completely lose herself over Nathan Harrison. The girl had literally restructured her entire life around that man—changed colleges, switched majors, turned down jobs in other cities. Harper had watched her best friend shrink into someone she barely recognized.  
  
When they got married last year, Harper thought maybe it would finally be enough. Maybe Nathan would actually see what he had.  
  
Apparently not.  
  
""I'm done with him."" Amelia's voice was steady, matter-of-fact.  
  
She smiled then—not the sad, hopeful smile Harper had gotten used to, but something real. For just a second, Harper saw a flash of the old Amelia. The girl who used to own every room she walked into, back when her dad was alive and the Visconti name still meant something in this city.  
  
""Good,"" Harper said simply. ""About damn time.""  
  
""Nathan doesn't know about the baby."" Amelia's fingers traced the edge of the exam table. ""There's a thirty-day waiting period for the divorce. I can't risk him finding out and trying to use it against me.""  
  
Harper nodded. Made perfect sense. During the cooling-off period, either spouse could withdraw the petition. If Nathan knew about the pregnancy, he'd probably try to guilt her into staying.  
  
""Okay, so here's the thing,"" Harper said, pulling up Amelia's file. ""We can't do the procedure right away. You're type AB-negative, which means we need to special-order blood just in case. It'll take about a week.""  
  
Amelia's face went tight. AB-negative—her father's blood type. One more reminder of everything she'd lost.  
  
""And Mia?"" Harper's voice went gentle. ""You're showing signs of threatened miscarriage. You need to be really careful the next few days. No stress, lots of rest.""  
  
""What does that mean exactly?""  
  
""Cramping, some spotting. Your body's... well, it's under a lot of stress right now. Just take it easy, okay?""  
  
Harper squeezed her friend's shoulder. ""I'm off in like an hour. Want me to drive you home?""  
  
""Yeah, that'd be great.""  
  
Amelia headed to the waiting room, one hand instinctively pressed to her stomach. Was her body already making the decision for her?  
  
Her phone buzzed. Bank alert—deposit from the new account she'd opened that morning. A text followed immediately.  
  
Hey! Royalty check just went through. You should see it in your account now.  
  
Before Nathan, Amelia had been a songwriter. Not the kind who performed—the kind who stayed in the background and crafted hits for other people. Her father had encouraged her music when she was young, back when money wasn't an issue. After he died and everything went to hell, those piano lessons became her survival.  
  
Got it, thanks.  
  
You know, you've written some of our biggest songs. Ever think about stepping into the spotlight? There's this new singing competition—all original material. I could get you an audition.  
  
Amelia scrolled through the email her manager had sent. A reality show, basically, but focused on songwriting and original music instead of covers.  
  
Maybe. Let me think about it.  
  
She set her phone down as a sharp cramp hit her lower abdomen.  
  
God, she missed her dad. If he could see her now...  
  
Meanwhile, social media was having a field day:  
  
\#VivianHopeCancer trending #1  
  
\#FloralDesignerDying trending #3  
  
\#TerminalDiagnosis trending #8  
  
The top video had already hit two million views:  
  
Celebrity floral designer Vivian Hope, known for her work with Manhattan's elite, revealed today that she has terminal stomach cancer and only six months to live. Instead of stepping away from public life, Hope plans to document her final months online.  
  
In the video, Vivian looked ethereal—pale but beautiful, like some tragic heroine. ""I want to share this journey with everyone who might be going through something similar. To show that even when you're dying, you can still choose hope.""  
  
The reporter's voice continued over B-roll footage: ""Hope has been romantically linked to Harrison Industries CEO Nathan Harrison, though Harrison recently married. Sources close to the situation say this could be a real-life tragedy worthy of Hollywood.""  
  
Vivian stepped back into frame, interrupting with practiced grace. ""I'm not going to lie about my feelings. Nathan is... he's an incredible man. But he's married, and I respect that completely. I would never try to come between them.""  
  
She walked away from the cameras, leaving the reporter to wrap up the segment.  
  
The moment she was out of sight, Vivian slipped into a waiting Town Car. A woman in scrubs handed her a water bottle, looking nervous as hell.  
  
""Spit it out,"" Vivian said without looking up from her phone.  
  
The woman glanced at the driver, then leaned closer. ""Miss Hope, your actual diagnosis is just gastritis. Having us falsify medical records is already illegal, but now you're going public with it? What happens when people start digging?""  
  
Vivian's smile was ice-cold. ""Is your clinic a licensed medical facility?""  
  
""Yes, but—""  
  
""Are my records stored independently?""  
  
""Yes.""  
  
""And what do those records say?""  
  
The woman swallowed hard. ""Terminal stomach cancer. Six-month prognosis.""  
  
""Exactly. So if anyone investigates, that's what they'll find."" Vivian's voice turned dangerous. ""And if complications arise later, we have options. Either I make a miraculous recovery thanks to some experimental treatment, or your clinic made a massive diagnostic error that put me through months of unnecessary trauma. Which scenario sounds better for your malpractice insurance?""  
  
The fake nurse went white. ""I understand, Miss Hope. I'm sorry for questioning you.""  
  
""Good. Now, we're going to New York Presbyterian.""  
  
""Is that... safe?""  
  
""I need to pick up some legitimate pain medication. Doctor's orders."" Vivian fired off a quick text to Nathan: At the hospital picking up meds. Can you meet me?  
  
His response was instant: Already on my way.  
  
Two floors up, Amelia sat in a bathroom stall, staring at the bright red blood on the tissue paper. Her hand pressed against her cramping stomach.  
  
It was starting.

1lwgehp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1lwgehp/why_is_the_nespresso_vertuoplus_coffee_maker_a/,Why is the Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee Maker a Top Choice?,"Testing out the Nespresso BNV420BLK1BUC1 has been an absolute treat for a coffee lover like me. As someone who thrives on that divine first cup in the morning, I was intrigued by the promise of barista-quality coffee at home. Naturally, the sleek design immediately caught my eye. Sitting on my countertop, the smooth black finish and compact 6""D x 17""W x 13""H dimensions make it the perfect fit, even for smaller kitchens. From its programmable features to fully automatic operation, this machine exudes sophistication.

**Design and Build Quality**  
One thing I quickly appreciated is the design ingenuity of the Nespresso coffee maker. Its motorized brew head is a feature I found unexpectedly handy. After a week of use, I was still amused by how the capsule lever opened and closed seamlessly at the press of a button. The movable water tank wasn’t something I thought would matter, but as someone who rearranges their countertop more often than necessary, this was surprisingly convenient. The premium design elements, like chrome accents, give it a polished look, elevating the aesthetic of my kitchen.

**Performance and Technology Shine**  
Using Nespresso’s Centrifusion technology—a patented brewing system that rotates capsules up to 7,000 times per minute—I noticed a distinct difference in flavor. Each cup had the crema and richness you’d expect from a high-end coffee shop. The barcode reading system also impressed me. It adjusts brewing parameters like temperature, size, and water flow for each capsule. Whether I made an 8oz coffee or a 1.35oz espresso, I could count on a consistently excellent cup every single time.

**Ease of Use and Convenience**  
As a non-morning person, simple functionality is a must for me. This machine's one-button operation was an absolute lifesaver on groggy mornings. The 25-second heat-up time didn’t just impress me—it left my older coffee maker collecting dust in the corner. Plus, the automatic energy-saving shut-off was a smart touch. Sometimes I’d start my brew and wander off into morning chaos, forgetting the machine entirely. Knowing it would shut off on its own gave me peace of mind.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Sleek, compact design fits most kitchens.  
- Adjustable water tank adds flexibility for varied counter arrangements.  
- Barista-level brewing with patented Centrifusion technology.  

**Negatives**  
However, no product is flawless, and this Nespresso model has areas that could be improved.  

- Occasional splashing happens when brewing smaller cup sizes.  
- Limited to Nespresso’s proprietary capsules, locking you into their ecosystem.  
- While functional, the larger water tank makes the machine slightly bulky for very tight spaces when fully extended.  

**Competitive Options in the Market**  
Comparing this coffee maker to others I’ve tried, I found a few noteworthy differences. Machines like the Keurig K-Café, while offering versatility, lack the premium technology that produces Nespresso's signature crema. Breville Bambino, on the other hand, allows for a more traditional espresso experience but doesn’t offer the foolproof simplicity of single-button operation. Where the Nespresso excels is its blend of convenience and authentic taste. For anyone who values easy, high-quality coffee at home, this machine has the edge over its competitors.

**Affordable Quality**  
Pricing was a curious point for me. While it’s not the cheapest coffee maker out there, the quality of coffee and level of automation justify the investment. Compared to monthly café trips, this machine could balance out in terms of cost over time. The free gift of a capsule starter pack also adds a nice touch for first-time users to explore various flavors.

Chapter 1  
  
Seven years into their marriage, Jessica Rolando discovered her husband Quentin Atlante had a six-year-old son.  
  
She crouched behind the slides at the kindergarten, watching Quentin bend down to scoop up a little boy, playing with him cheerfully.  
  
""Daddy, you haven't come to see me in sooooo long,"" the child complained.  
  
Quentin ruffled the boy's hair. ""Sorry, buddy. Daddy's been swamped at work. Be good for Mommy, alright?""  
  
Jessica froze on the spot instantly, her mind went completely blank.  
  
Daddy? Mommy?  
  
Quentin and child stood there together, their faces strikingly similar.  
  
Everything screamed the brutal truth: the man who'd sworn he'd love her forever had been cheating on her all along.  
  
They'd been childhood sweethearts, together for over a decade. Jessica had once taken a knife to the stomach saving Quentin's life, the attack leaving her not only childless but unable to ever have kids.  
  
Back then, Quentin had knelt beside her hospital bed, eyes red with tears: ""Screw having kids—I don't want anyone else. You're everything I need, Jess!""  
  
His trembling voice still echoed in her memory, yet the scene before her now shattered that promise into a million pieces.  
  
Jessica stumbled backward, her heart feeling like it was being carved up by razor blades, torn into countless bleeding fragments.  
  
She couldn't bear to watch anymore. She was terrified she'd march over there and confront Quentin, even more terrified of breaking down like some pathetic fool and being rejected.  
  
She turned and fled.  
  
At the kindergarten entrance, her best friend Betty Laiperze had been waiting by her SUV. Seeing Jessica's ashen face, Betty immediately jumped out. ""Jesus, Jess! What's wrong?""  
  
""Nosh said you forgot something and went back to get it. What the hell happened?""  
  
Nosh was Betty's son, and it was Betty who had dragged Jessica along to today's parent-teacher conference.  
  
Jessica's face was chalk-white, tears burning behind her eyes. ""Betty, I need you to run a background check on someone.""  
  
""Who?""  
  
""Quentin Atlante..."" Her throat constricted as she forced out the words in a hoarse whisper. ""He has a son.""  
  
...  
  
【Baby, just one more week and I'll be home. Missing me yet?】  
  
Jessica stared at Quentin's text, tears streaming down her face like a dam had burst.  
  
Every July for the past six years, he'd disappear for two weeks on some ""business trip"" to check on their overseas branches.  
  
Six whole years, and she'd never questioned it. Not once.  
  
Reality had just bitch-slapped her hard, laughing at what a complete idiot she'd been.  
  
Quentin wasn't on any damn business trip—he was playing house with his mistress and their kid!  
  
If she hadn't stumbled onto this nightmare today, she'd probably still be living in la-la land.  
  
Jessica kept torturing herself, flipping through the photos on her phone. Rain pounded against the windows while lightning lit up the sky, casting shadows across her ghostly pale face.  
  
Maybe she should've seen this coming.  
  
The Atlante family was old-school traditional—no way in hell would they let some barren woman hold the title of Mrs. Atlante.  
  
Unless they'd orchestrated this whole thing from the start.  
  
So what role had her so-called devoted husband been playing all along?  
  
Jessica felt like her heart was being fed through a paper shredder. She and Quentin had been inseparable since childhood—everyone always said they were meant to be together forever.  
  
When she was eight, she'd fallen out of their backyard oak tree. He'd thrown himself underneath her, breaking his arm, then smiled through the pain saying it was ""no big deal.""  
  
At twelve, when she got her first period and stained her dress, even though he knew what was happening, he'd still freaked out and sobbed that he'd ""die if anything happened to her.""  
  
At eighteen, he'd secretly entered some underground street race, nearly getting himself killed to win a ring just to propose to her.  
  
He'd said: ""Jess, I'm gonna love you forever.""  
  
Teenage love burns so pure and fierce—it had completely captured her heart.  
  
Then just right before their wedding, his enemies had kidnapped her, holding her for three hellish days. When they found her, she was barely breathing.  
  
Quentin had gotten three ribs broken trying to save her, and that's when she'd taken a knife meant for him, losing her chance to ever be a mother.  
  
When Quentin's mother Laurel Flores found out, she'd definitely tried to break them up.  
  
But Quentin, still covered in bruises, had knelt in the family chapel for three days on a hunger strike, declaring: ""I'd rather lose the Atlante name than lose Jess."" Finally forcing his mother to back down.  
  
After they healed, they'd gotten married quickly. All of New York had witnessed their epic love story.  
  
But in the end, he'd still betrayed her.  
  
Her phone buzzed. The screen read ""Hubby""—how fucking ironic.  
  
Jessica numbly swiped to answer. His warm voice came through: ""Hey babe, you eating real meals while I'm gone? Missing me?""  
  
Before, she would've melted into those sweet words, desperate to tell him how much she missed him.  
  
But now... she was terrified that if she spoke, she'd break down completely.  
  
""Babe? Something wrong? Don't be scared—I'll catch the next flight home to be with you right now!""  
  
Quentin's voice turned frantic—she could hear him moving around, probably grabbing his wallet and keys.  
  
But Jessica couldn't bear to see him right now.  
  
""I'm fine."" She was fighting to keep it together, but her voice came out rough and broken. ""Seriously, don't ditch work for me. Just fighting off a cold or something.""  
  
This was the first time she'd ever lied to Quentin.  
  
He didn't seem to notice, apparently distracted by something on his end, but still fussed over her: ""Alright, but get some sleep, yeah? Call me if you need anything, okay? Don't make me worry.""  
  
Jessica managed a weak ""Mm-hmm.""  
  
She was about to hang up when she heard a woman's sultry voice in the background: ""Quentin, Carter's finally asleep. Now we can...""  
  
She caught the sharp intake of his breath before the line went dead.  
  
Jessica's knuckles went white as she gripped the phone, ice spreading through her veins.  
  
He was with that bitch right now... She couldn't let herself think about what they were doing.  
  
A broken whimper escaped her throat—a sound completely beyond her control, like someone had reached into her chest and was crushing her heart with their bare hands.  
  
She'd tried to convince herself maybe Quentin was just trapped in this impossible situation because of the kid.  
  
But now it was crystal clear—he was a willing participant.  
  
Betty must have heard her losing it because she burst through the door, then froze when she saw Jessica's hollow expression. For once, Betty—who never hesitated about anything—didn't know what to do.  
  
""Jess, no man is worth destroying yourself over.""  
  
Tears splashed onto the photos in Jessica's lap, each drop echoing in the silence.  
  
Betty's heart shattered. She pulled Jessica into her arms, voice shaking with rage: ""That son of a bitch! Quentin is such a piece of shit!""  
  
""All those pretty promises when he proposed to you, and now he's got the balls to keep a side chick and bastard behind your back.""  
  
Jessica closed her eyes, letting the tears fall freely. She'd already made her decision about what came next...  
  
Chapter 2  
  
The next morning dawned bright and clear after the storm.  
  
Jessica hadn't slept a damn minute.  
  
She'd spent the entire night thinking—she'd experienced love in its purest form, so how could she settle for this fake bullshit?  
  
She was Jessica Rolando who loved Quentin with everything she had, but she was also Jessica Rolando, daughter of the Rolando family. And she didn't play second fiddle to anyone.  
  
Mind made up, she called her father Dexter: ""Dad, remember how you wanted to expand into the UK market? Betty's husband has ties to British royalty, and she's taking Nosh back there in two weeks. I want to go with them and scope things out.""  
  
Dexter sounded confused: ""Quentin put you up to this?""  
  
""Nope, this is my call."" Jessica let out a bitter laugh. Everyone automatically assumed she and Quentin were joined at the hip—even her own father.  
  
Dexter was clearly surprised. His daughter had never wanted to be away from that Atlante boy for more than a day, so why the sudden interest in traveling halfway around the world?  
  
""Jessie, did that bastard do something to hurt you?"" Dexter's voice turned deadly serious.  
  
Jessica pressed her lips together, then decided to keep things vague for now: ""Dad, don't ask questions yet. I'll tell you everything once I'm in London.""  
  
The Rolandos and Atlantes had been business partners for decades, and the marriage had tangled things up even more. She didn't want her family caught in the crossfire.  
  
Her father finally gave in: ""Alright, but come by the office today. You'll need to get up to speed on the European operations.""  
  
Jessica nodded and hung up. She dragged herself to the bathroom, wincing at her reflection—her eyes were swollen like she'd gone ten rounds with a boxer.  
  
The divorce papers were already sitting on her nightstand, delivered by her lawyer that morning. But she still had no clue how to bring this up to Quentin. Seven years didn't just disappear overnight.  
  
She caked on concealer to hide the evidence of her breakdown, threw on a sharp business suit and headed downstairs.  
  
Betty was in the kitchen with Nosh, probably trying to act normal after yesterday's shitshow.  
  
""Aunt Jess is awake!"" Nosh came running over on his little legs, grabbing her hand and blowing on it gently. ""Mommy said your heart was hurting yesterday. My magic breath will make it better!""  
  
Six-year-olds were so damn innocent. Jessica ruffled his hair. ""You're such a sweet boy, Nosh. Aunt Jess feels much better now. Go finish your breakfast with Mommy.""  
  
Nosh nodded seriously and scampered back to Betty.  
  
Jessica's mind drifted to yesterday—Quentin laughing and playing with that little boy.  
  
If their baby had survived, he'd probably be older than Carter by now.  
  
Jessica took a shaky breath, shoving down the pain threatening to surface again. She grabbed her purse and headed out the door.  
  
But the second she stepped out of Betty's townhouse, she spotted a figure leaning against a black Mercedes in the distance.  
  
Quentin looked exhausted, a cigarette dangling from his lips, smoke curling around him like a shield.  
  
Jessica froze. According to Betty's intel, both Carrie Versta and her son had July birthdays. Carrie's had already passed, but Carter's was still coming up—so why the hell was Quentin back early?  
  
Her stare must've been intense because he suddenly looked up. And the moment their eyes met, his dull eyes completely lit up.  
  
He strode over and pulled her into his arms.  
  
His embrace was still warm, but now it felt like it was burning her alive.  
  
""How's that cold? You sounded awful on the phone, so I caught a red-eye back.""  
  
""Got to the house and you weren't there—figured you'd be at Betty's.""  
  
Quentin's voice was thick with concern, and he looked genuinely worried.  
  
Jessica still couldn't wrap her head around it—how could the man who claimed to love her more than life itself be playing house with another woman and their kid?  
  
Her lips trembled as she swallowed the bile rising in her throat. She wanted to scream at him, demand answers, but instead she managed: ""I'm fine now. Was just heading home.""  
  
Quentin's shoulders sagged with relief: ""Next time you're sick, call me immediately, okay? I was losing my mind worrying about you.""  
  
His voice was so gentle, so caring—for a split second, she almost believed they were still that perfect couple.  
  
But then she caught sight of a slim figure hovering near the street corner.  
  
Carrie stood under a tree with phone pressed to her ear, saying something. A second later, Quentin's phone started buzzing.  
  
He glanced at the screen and his face shifted: ""Shit, emergency at the office. I gotta handle this.""  
  
Jessica's breath caught. She wasn't blind—she'd seen that name flash across his screen. Carrie Versta.  
  
The bitterness was about to choke her, but she forced herself to say: ""Of course, go handle your business. Work comes first.""  
  
Quentin looked genuinely guilty as he kissed her forehead before jumping in his car and speeding off.  
  
The moment Quentin drove away, Carrie ended her call and sauntered over with a predatory smile: ""Hello there, you must be Jessica. I'm Carrie Versta, I'm...""  
  
She trailed off meaningfully, taking in Jessica's tight expression and realizing something.  
  
""Oh, looks like Miss. Rolando already know about me and Carter. Well then, just sit back and enjoy the show.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Jessica hailed a cab and tailed Carrie to the hospital.  
  
Standing outside the room, she watched everything unfold, feeling like a knife was twisting in her chest.  
  
She bit down hard on her lip to keep from making a sound.  
  
Quentin's son was hooked up to an IV, his little face pale and exhausted—he looked so fragile.  
  
Quentin was completely freaking out, pacing the room and absolutely losing his shit:  
  
""Are you kidding me right now? Can't even treat a kid's fever properly!""  
  
The attending physician was Wayne Cortes—Jessica recognized him as one of Quentin's best buddies from college.  
  
""Your kid's running a fever because he caught a cold. Maybe focus on being a better parent instead of screaming at my residents!""  
  
""Jesus, Quentin, I don't know what's gotten into you. Didn't you say you'd pay that woman off after she had the baby? Now you're calling me over every damn cold. What happens if Jessica finds out?""  
  
After a long pause, Quentin's voice came out tired and defeated: ""What am I supposed to do, Wayne? The kid loses his mind every time I try to send Carrie away. He won't stop crying. I can't just let him suffer like that.""  
  
""Oh please, we both know this isn't about the kid,"" Wayne snorted. ""You're getting attached to playing house.""  
  
That set Quentin off even more. He rubbed his temples hard: ""That's bullshit and you know it. Jessica's the only woman I've ever loved—that hasn't changed. But the Atlante family needs an heir, and you need to help me keep this from her. I can't stand the thought of hurting her.""  
  
""As for Carrie, she gave me a son. I owe her that much.""  
  
Right on cue, Carrie pushed through the door, tears streaming down her face: ""Oh God, Quentin, this is all my fault. I should've taken better care of Carter. He spiked a fever right after you left last night, crying for his daddy, but I didn't want to interrupt your time with your wife...""  
  
Quentin touched the kid's burning forehead and sighed, his heart finally softened.  
  
He pulled Carrie into his arms: ""Shh, don't cry. I'm not blaming you. Carter's our son—I'm the one who's been a shitty father.""  
  
Carrie clutched at his shirt, her fingers trailing across his chest: ""Quentin, I know I'll never measure up to Jessica, but I just can't stand watching our boy suffer...""  
  
Quentin's expression hardened with determination: ""Nobody's gonna dare to make my son suffer. But you need to take care of yourself too. Look at you, you're a mess.""  
  
He reached up and gently wiped away a tear from her cheek, the intimate gesture slicing through Jessica's chest like a blade.  
  
Jessica clenched her fists so hard her nails drew blood, leaving crescent-shaped marks on her palms. She couldn't even feel the physical pain anymore.  
  
Nothing could compete with the agony tearing through her heart.  
  
Rain started pouring down again as Jessica left the hospital.  
  
She walked through the downpour, completely numb. Rain mixed with tears on her face, blurring her vision, but it couldn't wash away the devastation inside her.  
  
By the time she reached the Rolando Group headquarters, her heels had rubbed her ankles raw and bloody.  
  
The receptionist nearly jumped out of her skin when she saw Jessica's condition: ""Ms. Rolando! Oh my God, what happened? Should I call Mr. Atlante? He's going to be so worried when he sees you like this!""  
  
Jessica's heart had gone completely numb. Yeah, everyone just assumed Quentin loved her—no exceptions.  
  
But they never knew how much lies and betrayal were mixed into that so-called love.  
  
She gently pushed away the receptionist's helping hands, her voice hoarse: ""I'm fine. Just got caught in the rain. Can you grab me some clean clothes?""  
  
She handed over her card and locked herself in the nearest conference room.  
  
The moment the door closed, Jessica completely fell apart. She'd thought seeing those photos had prepared her for reality.  
  
But watching that perfect little family unit up close had ripped open her deepest wounds all over again, leaving her raw and bleeding.  
  
Her heartbroken sobs echoed through the empty conference room.  
  
She wanted to scream at Quentin—why was he the one making all those promises back then, and now he was the one playing happy family with someone else?  
  
A knock at the door finally pulled her back to reality.  
  
By the time she pulled herself together and opened the door, whoever it was had already left. Just a fresh outfit and her credit card sitting there, plus a steaming cup of coffee.  
  
A handwritten note was tucked under the mug: ""Don't worry, Ms. Rolando. I didn't call Mr. Atlante. Figured you wouldn't want him to worry.""  
  
A storm of emotions churned in Jessica's heart. But in the end she tore up the note and tossed it in the trash.  
  
She grabbed the clothes and hit the bathroom to change. Within minutes, she was back to being the untouchable Rolando heiress—nothing could touch her now.  
  
She spent the rest of the day buried in work, her heels clicking authoritatively across the executive floor.  
  
Quentin had been texting her nonstop. She didn't even glance at her phone.  
  
That evening, she dragged herself exhausted ass home, planning to pack and catch the first flight out of JFK in the morning.  
  
But the moment she opened the front door, she heard a child's giggles echoing through the living room.  
  
And there was Carrie Versta, standing right in her goddamn house like she owned the place.

Monday morning was quiet. Peaceful, even.

I woke up at 4:00 a.m. sharp—no nightmare, no sweat-drenched sheets, no lingering screams clawing their way out of my throat.

Just... silence.

The shower felt warmer than usual, like it was trying to lull me back to sleep. I stood there longer than I meant to, letting it run over my face. Steam clung to the mirror, but I wiped it away out of habit.

I looked okay. Normal, maybe. My skin wasn’t as pale. I couldn’t find the grey hair anymore—just soft brown. My eyes looked tired, sure, but less... exhausted. Like someone had rewound me a few days.

I actually felt hungry. I wanted to make breakfast.

I headed downstairs, a little unsteady, but upright. Head high.

The light switch clicked under my fingers. The kitchen blinked to life.

And there they were.

Tentacles.

They slithered in through the living room like they’d always been there—slow and deliberate, crawling across the floor in perfect silence.

My blood turned to ice. My skin prickled all over.

I just... watched.

Then I moved.

The living room was dim. I didn’t remember turning off that lamp in the corner, but it was dark now. The thing stood just beside the front door. Its tentacles coiled around its body, spiraling down to the floor, threading through the carpet fibers like roots.

It didn’t move. Didn’t even twitch.

But I could feel it watching me, it’s hateful gaze piercing my soul, though it had no eyes.

I walked back into the kitchen. My hands went on autopilot: eggs, pan, salt. My heartbeat thudded behind my teeth the whole time. I kept catching glimpses of it in my peripheral vision—never direct, never center frame. Just shadows at the edge of thought.

I plated the eggs. They looked fine. Like any other Monday.

At 5:07, I heard her.

“Hey James,” Daria mumbled, her voice thick with sleep.

I turned slightly, keeping the thing just out of view. Daria wrapped her arms around my waist, resting her face between my shoulder blades.

“James, I slept horribly,” she groaned, half-pouting.

I turned to her, leaving the bowl on the counter. Her hair was tangled. Her eyes were puffy. She looked soft, human. Warm.

“Are you okay?” I asked, folding her into a hug. I kissed the crown of her head.

She nodded her head lazily.

“I love you, Daria,” I whispered.

She murmured something into my back—something like “love you more.”

I didn’t look at the thing again.

I left through the back door.





At 12:30 I got the call I’ve been waiting for. Daria’s voice radiated from the phone, she sounded so excited, so happy.

“Ok James, you better get your things in order, I’m leaving for the clinic ok.” She giggled “Don’t you flake on me this time.” Then her voice softened a bit “Please come this time.”

Dad, just like I thought, let me go. He put his hands on my shoulders firmly, giving me this fake serious expression.

“Son, I’m going to fire you if you don’t bring me pictures, last time I had to beg Daria for them.”

I pulled into the parking lot at 12:50. The clinic was empty; the only cars that were there were staff.

I walked through the door, a chime accompanying my entrance. I stated my name and who I was here for. A nurse—I think—ushered me in.

The ultrasound room was colder than I expected—small, windowless, lit only by the dull glow of a computer screen. A plastic bottle of clear gel sat next to the keyboard like a condiment on a diner table. The exam bed was draped in thin, crinkly paper that rustled every time Daria moved.

She lay back slowly, belly exposed, the rest of her half-covered with a hospital sheet that barely reached her knees. The technician—a middle-aged woman with kind eyes and no visible interest in small talk—squeezed the gel onto Daria’s stomach. It glistened under the soft overhead light.

Then came the wand. She pressed it down—not painfully, but firm. Still Daria flinched.

The screen flickered—grey static, then shadows swimming.

A curve. A twitch. A ripple of movement.

“There’s the heartbeat,” the tech said gently.

Then the sound filled the room. Fast. Watery. Mechanical. Like a horse galloping underwater. It made my skin crawl.

Daria squeezed my hand. “You hear that, James?” she whispered, smiling.

But I wasn’t looking at her.

The image was wrong.

At first, it looked like a baby’s head—but then the skull **bulged outward**, pulsing as if something inside was pushing to get out.

From the spine, **long black cords** extended—slick, rope-like, **moving**. Not waving. **Reaching**. One uncoiled and brushed the edge of the screen.

Another pulsed from the abdomen—**thicker than the legs**, like a root burrowing into the flesh from the inside.

My body locked. I couldn’t breathe. My hand twitched in Daria’s, but she didn’t look at me.

“He’s really growing,” she giggled. “He’ll be as big as us someday.”

I stared at the screen, bile rising in my throat.

Then—**blink.**

The image was normal again.

A baby. Just a baby. Soft skull. Normal limbs. Perfect little heartbeat.

Then the tech hit a button. The image vanished.

Daria beamed. “That was amazing.”

I just nodded, still gripping her hand, my palm ice-cold.





Ever since that morning, the thing hasn’t stopped watching.

At night, it waits in the bedroom corner.

During the day, it stands beside the front door—silent, still, always there.

I pass it every time I come home. I don’t look at it anymore. I hear it whispering when I close my eyes—sharp, venomous syllables in a language I can’t begin to understand. They rattle in my skull like static.

Sleep is a joke now. Work’s worse than ever. I’ve been moved to the prep station just to keep up with the flood of orders. Bills are stacking, and the real estate deal I need to close keeps slipping further away. I’ve even thought about asking Dad for help. But all of that… faded when I opened the front door that night. It was the Monday after Daria’s ultrasound.

The box with the crib was sitting in the nursery. Daria was painting clouds on the baby-blue walls, her brush moving slow and steady.

She turned as I stepped in. “Oh! I didn’t know you’d be home so early.”

I held up the pizza box. “It’s six o’clock. Figured I’d pick up dinner.”

She smiled. “That actually sounds amazing right now.”

I pointed at one of the clouds. “That one does not look anything like a cloud.”

It looked more like a blob than a nice soft cloud.

She pouted. “I’ve never been an artist, and it’s not like the baby’ll care.”





Dinner was quiet in the best kind of way. The thing didn’t appear. The kitchen felt warm again—like it used to. I honestly couldn’t even taste the pizza.

Daria sat across from me, still in her paint-streaked clothes, eyes soft and glowing in the evening light. The sunlight poured through the window, catching her hair—it looked like fire paused mid-flicker.

She caught me staring. “Jamie,” she said, tilting her head.

“Yeah?”

“What are you looking forward to most?” She rested her chin in her hand. “About the baby, I mean.”

I thought for a second. “Family dinners,” I said finally. “Us at the table. All of us. Just... eating together. When he’s older, of course.”

She smiled like she was already there, watching it happen.

“I’m looking forward to taking care of him,” she said softly. “The house is so quiet sometimes. I can’t wait for it to be messy and loud and alive. I want to hear little feet on the floor.” She placed her hand on her belly and laughed gently. “He’s kicking again. I think he knows we’re talking about him.”

I stood and moved around the table, crouching beside her. “Really?”

She took my hand and guided it to her stomach. A few seconds passed—and then I felt it: a firm, tiny nudge beneath the skin. Like a heartbeat you could touch.

My lips curled into a smile I didn’t have to think about. “Still feels like a muscle twitch to me.”

She laughed. “Don’t ruin the magic, James.”

I kissed the side of her belly. “Okay. That one was a ninja kick.”

She beamed, running her fingers through my hair. “We still need a name.”

I nodded. “I know. Feels like we’re behind.”

She looked off, thoughtful. Then her eyes found mine again. “Honestly? I like James Jr.”

I raised an eyebrow. “Really?”

She nodded. “I like the way it sounds. And it means I get to call him Junior. That just feels right, you know?”

She grinned. “Can’t wait to chase him around the house yelling it.”

I laughed with her. I really did. For a moment, it was like none of it mattered—not the exhaustion, not the dreams, not the bills. Just me, her, and the baby we were waiting on. But the moment didn’t last. It never can.





The thing won’t leave me alone anymore.

It follows me now. Not just at home. Not just in dreams.

At work, it stands in the back corner of the freezer—just far enough into the shadows that the frost doesn’t touch it. I see it when I turn around, after grabbing a box of sausage patties or hash browns. Just… standing there. Watching.

It never moves. But every time I turn my back, I swear I feel it leaning forward. Like it’s *considering* something.

At the firm, it’s stationed beside the coffee machine. Mary thinks I’m lazy. She keeps giving me this puzzled look every time I ask her to pour my cup. I can’t explain it to her. 

It’s back by the front door at home, too. Same place as always. Still as furniture. Just part of the layout now.

I’ve stopped reacting. If I don’t acknowledge it, maybe it won’t do anything. Maybe it just wants to be seen. Maybe it already *knows* everything.

I’m not sleeping. Not really. I rest in fragments now. Fifteen minutes here. Maybe an hour on the couch if I’m lucky. I’ve been getting up earlier just to get ahead of it. 4:30 a.m., every morning. McDonalds opens at five. I try to be there before it notices I’m gone.

I’m starting to feel like a robot. Just going through the same motions every day. I can’t tell if I’m even exhausted.

The only upside is the money. With how much I’ve been working, I’ve finally pulled ahead. Two real estate deals closed last week—$7,000 sitting in my account. It’s the most I’ve had in years. Enough to cover the hospital. Enough for the next two months of bills. Enough to maybe even buy Daria something nice.

But none of it feels real. It’s just numbers.

Daria’s due soon.





**Sunday, I took an extra shift at McDonald’s.** Daria looked disappointed when I told her.

Still, I managed to finish the crib. Daria got the nursery painted.

It’s strange, standing in that room now — soft blue walls, clouds near the middle, faintly cartoonish. It feels so… nice, in there. I even helped with the ceiling — stuck glow-in-the-dark stars to it, so when it's bedtime, it looks like a night sky frozen in time.

This morning, I caught Daria just standing there — arms crossed, hands on her hips, scanning the room like a commander surveying a battlefield. Every now and then, she’d adjust something. A stuffed animal. A mobile. A blanket corner. Then step back. Then forward again.

She’s adorable when she’s like that.

But the moment I got to work, the feeling curdled.

The thing had moved.

It stood dead center in the lobby — out in the open now, waiting for me behind the register.

It stared through me.

Its tentacles stretched slowly outward, crawling up the walls, spilling across the ceiling like roots. The air felt thick — humid, oppressive. Like standing in a jungle that had long since rotted.

The smell hit next: mold and something older, something wet and dead.

And still, no one noticed.

Customers stepped on the tendrils, slick and pulsing. I heard them squish underfoot. A kid leaned against the wall, I watched a strand of black slime fall down and soak into his hair — thick and glistening.

He didn’t flinch.

His parents kept eating.

I made it through the shift. Barely. By the end, I couldn’t feel my fingers. My legs moved without me.

I almost ran out the door.

My phone rang as I reached the car.

I climbed inside, hands shaking, and answered.

“James?” Daria’s voice crackled through the phone, slightly alarmed.

“Yes?” I responded.

“Your parents are coming over. They just called and said they’d be over in 30 minutes.” She explained.

“What!” I half yelled into my phone. “No notice, no nothing?”

“I know, I was just about to get in the bath.” She continued. “Do you want me to just order some pizza? I mean that’s what we always have, I don’t have time to cook them lunch.”

I sighed. “Yeah, that’d be fine. Order the bigger, more expensive pizzas. I'll bill it to Dad. Dad likes Meat Lovers, and Mom likes pineapple, uhh, nevermind — get her cheese and we’ll keep it.”

She giggled. “Alright, at least we’ll get something out of it.”

I hung up, still staring at the empty passenger seat.

Traffic was worse than I expected. It took me thirty-five minutes to get home.

Dad’s big, showy SUV was parked crooked in the driveway, taking up most of it and leaving Daria’s car awkwardly squeezed in. I had to reverse back out and park on the street just to avoid boxing them in.

When I walked inside, my parents and Daria were already gathered at the table, chatting. Four oversized pizza boxes sat stacked in the middle like a makeshift centerpiece. She’d really ordered the expensive ones — probably twelve bucks each.

“Well, look who finally showed up,” Dad bellowed from across the room.

I scanned the house. No sign of the thing.

“James, why haven’t you called your mother?” Mom was already up, arms open, pulling me into a hug.

She smelled like expensive lotion and wine. Her long blond hair hadn’t grayed yet — always perfectly brushed. In her mid-fifties, but she still dressed like she was on her way to a charity gala. And that expression — vaguely disappointed, like she was reviewing a hotel room she didn’t book.

Over her shoulder, Daria caught my eye. We shared the same look: *Really?*

“You look exhausted,” Mom said, brushing her fingers across my cheek. “Are you even sleeping?”

I pulled back, gently. “Been working a lot.”

Her silence demanded more.

“My insurance isn’t great. I want to have enough saved for the birth,” I added.

She gave a tight nod, but her eyes kept scanning my face like she was still looking for something to fix.

“So,” Dad said, rising with a grunt and wiping his hands on a napkin, “where’s my grandson going to be staying? I’m not paying for this pizza until I see it.”

I pointed upstairs, but he was already moving. Daria followed, probably to keep him from poking into the wrong room.

Before I could follow, Mom placed a manicured hand on my shoulder.

“You could’ve done better than pizza, James,” she said, voice clipped.

I turned. “You gave us thirty minutes’ notice. What did you expect, a five-course meal?”

“Pizza just… doesn’t reflect status,” she replied, as if that explained anything. Then she swept past me and headed upstairs.

That’s always been Mom. More concerned with appearances than effort. She’s never worked a day in her life, but you’d think she ran a Fortune 500 company the way she talked about “presenting well.”

I followed them upstairs.

The nursery door was open.

**And there it was.** The thing stood at the end of the hallway, etched in shadow. Its tentacles hung like vines — draping from the ceiling, crawling along the floor, weaving across the walls. But they all **stopped** just short of the nursery doorway.

I stepped into the nursery, calm on the outside, skin crawling beneath.

“Whoa,” Dad said, craning his neck to look up. “You even did the stars on the ceiling. Do they glow?”

“They do,” Daria said proudly. “James put them up.” She looked down at her belly and added with a laugh, “I’m… not tall enough.”

Mom stood near the bookshelf, smiling with polite approval. “You’ve really created a lovely space for Junior.”

Daria beamed. “I know, right? We worked so hard on this. James built the furniture, and I painted and decorated. It took forever. I wish we’d done it earlier — before I got so… round.”

She walked them through every piece of it — the crib, the clouds, the night-sky ceiling. Her voice was light, full of pride and love. For a moment, it felt like all the bad things were far away.

I stood by the door, nodding occasionally, eyes flicking back to the hallway.

The thing didn’t move.

Eventually, we filtered back downstairs.



The living room lights were too bright. The air felt too still. And the pizza smelled off — greasy and sharp, like cardboard soaked in salt. I chewed through a slice without tasting it, nodding along to whatever conversation my parents were having. But my mind was still upstairs.

Would the thing turn our house into another jungle, like it did McDonald’s? Would the walls start sweating, the floors pulse underfoot, the air grow thick and wet and moldy?

I flinched at the thought.

“James?” My mother’s voice cut through the fog.

I blinked. Everyone was staring. Even Daria.

“James, yoo-hoo. Earth to James,” Dad said, waving a hand in front of my face with a chuckle.

“Sorry.” I shifted in my chair. “Spaced out.”

Daria gave me a concerned glance.

“Well,” Mom said, brushing a napkin across her lips, “we’re heading to Florida next week. A little early spring break. You two should come.”

Dad jumped in. “We’ll cover it — the flights, hotel. Everything.”

He meant **he** would. My mother had never paid for anything but Botox and judgment.

Daria hesitated. “Elizabeth, I’d love to, but… I don’t think I can. The baby could come any time now. The doctor said we should be on alert.”

“You’re at 32 weeks, right?” Dad asked, squinting.

“Thirty-six,” she corrected, more gently than I would’ve.

I cleared my throat. “And with hospital bills, I need to pick up more hours.”

Mom let out a tight, irritated sigh — the kind that could cut drywall.

“I suppose that’s a no, then,” she said, her tone flat but pointed.

I nodded. “Yeah. Sorry. It’s just bad timing.”

Dad draped an arm around her shoulder. “Hey, it’s fine. No pressure. Next time.”

There was an awkward silence after that. Just the sound of crust crunching and someone’s chewing. I glanced over at Daria — she looked a little stunned, but she shrugged and leaned forward to grab another slice.

Eventually, they stood to leave. Mom offered a stiff goodbye hug. Dad slapped my back and told me to “keep grinding.” They left the leftover pizza.

I stood in the doorway watching their SUV pull away, the tail lights glowing red in the dimming sky.

Daria joined me, folding her arms across her chest.

“I’m starting to get sick of pizza,” I muttered.

She laughed softly. “I’m not. Still my favorite.”

We stood there a while, not saying anything. Just the hum of the fridge and the ticking clock.



Daria was still standing in the entryway, arms crossed. Her hair was caught in the overhead light, glowing faintly orange. She shifted, hesitating.

“James… does your mom dislike me?” she asked, softly.

I turned to her. She wasn’t angry. Just small. Like the question had been sitting in her chest all night and finally found its way out.

“No,” I said quickly. “Daria, she just… you know how she is. My mom’s too concerned with how things *look*. That’s her whole deal. Don’t take it personally.”

She nodded, but didn’t look relieved.

“I just…” She rubbed one arm with the other. “I want both to like me. My parents don’t even want to see me.”

She looked down. Her voice dropped a bit. “I called them a couple days ago. Told them they’d have a grandchild soon.”

I stayed quiet.

“They wanted me to go to college,” she continued. “And as they put it, *‘do something with your life.’* Like creating a new one doesn’t count.”

Her shoulders slumped, Her expression falling.

“Is that normal?” she asked, barely above a whisper.

“No,” I said, stepping closer. “That’s not normal at all. It’s cruel. They’re losing the best part of their lives.”

She nodded again, but slower this time.

I tried to soften the air. “Don’t worry about my parents, okay? They like you. You should’ve seen my mom when I told her you were pregnant—it actually knocked her out of her ‘ice queen’ routine. She and Dad were literally jumping for joy. I’ve never seen them do that. Ever.”

That earned a small smile. Just a twitch at the corners of her mouth, but it was enough.

I flopped onto the couch with a sigh and grabbed the remote. The living room was dim except for the amber spill of light from the kitchen and the pale blue flicker of the TV screen coming to life.

Daria eased down beside me. Her hands rested on her stomach.

“I mean, I have you,” she said, gently. “So it’s all good.”

She laughed—not forced. Just tired and soft. “I can’t wait for the baby.”

I turned on some dumb Hallmark movie.

“Oh I bet, he’s pretty heavy,” I joked.

She looked jokingly taken aback then poked my cheek. “You know, James, most people are more excited about the *birth* of their child than just its *physical weight.*”

I shrugged, smiling. “Yeah, though he’s probably heavy. Especially today. Almost seems like he’s lower down.”

She nodded, rubbing her stomach slowly. “He’s going to be a big guy. I can feel it.”

She leaned her head onto my shoulder, a content little breath slipping out of her.

“Probably gonna outgrow his dad,” I said. “Definitely his grandpa. He’s short.”

Daria giggled. “You’re not exactly a giant, James.”

“No,” I said, mock-sulking. “But I’m medium tall.”

We sat like that for a while—her head on my shoulder. The glow from the TV painted shifting light across the room.

Daria pointed at the screen. “I didn’t know we got these silly movies.”

She turned her head, squinting up at me. “You’re not *paying* for these, are you?”

I shook my head. “No. I don’t even have time to sit down and watch anything.”

She nodded, then grew quiet—her eyes tracking something across the carpet.

“Hey, James?” she asked, her voice soft.

“Yeah?”

“What do you think Junior’s favorite color will be?”

She looked down as she asked it, hands smoothing her belly like she was already trying to comfort him.

“Blue,” I said.

Daria furrowed her brow looking up again. “Why? You said that pretty fast.”

“Well... we painted his room blue. So, I mean... logic, right? Mine’s red because my race car bed as a kid was red.”

She smirked. “Fair. That’s a fair hypothesis.”

I looked at the screen. The movie was already halfway in. Some guy in a perfectly tailored suit was talking on two phones at once.

“Wanna watch the movie?” I asked. “Thirty bucks says the initial fiancé’s a rich guy who’s too busy for the female lead.”

“As long as it’s with you,” she said, resting her cheek against my shoulder again. “Sure.”

I wrapped my arm around her. It all felt so… warm.

Daria shifted, uncomfortable.

I looked at her to see what was wrong, but she was focused on the movie.



The movie ended in the usual soft-focus blur—kisses, confessions, everyone conveniently happy. Daria stretched, yawning, and glanced at the clock.



“Oh. It’s already six o’clock,” she said with mock disappointment. “I’m guessing it’s bedtime for you.”

“Yep,” I said, standing with a groan. “Big breakfast planned. Extravagant, within our means.”

“Leftover pizza?” she teased.

“Nope. I bought the expensive bacon. We’re celebrating thirty-seven weeks.”

She blinked. “It’s thirty-six weeks.”

I laughed. “Got my weeks messed up. I realized when you told dad earlier.”

She lightly smacked my arm, half-smiling. “James, you can’t be forgetting that kind of thing.”

“I’ve got a lot on my mind,” I said. “Guess I’ll have to carry you to bed as penance.”

“Oh, so now we’re romantic,” she said, grinning.

“Just making up for lost time.”

I scooped her into a princess carry, slow and steady.

“You know you’re heavy,” I muttered as I shifted my grip.

She narrowed her eyes, amused. “James, if you want this to be your only child, keep talking.”

“Honestly, between my mouth and my jobs, we’re probably maxed out anyway.”

She laughed—real and bright. “With time, James. With time.”

I started up the stairs. The thing was in the hallway. Its limbs were still. Tentacles curled tight against the ceiling beams, pulling slightly farther away. I didn’t look at it long.

I carried Daria past without speaking. The monster didn’t move.

I laid her gently on the bed. She giggled as I pulled the covers over her and kissed her forehead.

“Love you, James,” she mumbled, already sinking into the pillows.

“Love you too,” I said, settling down beside her.

Her warmth met mine in the quiet.

She shifted a little, one arm draped across my chest. The house was still—no pipes creaked, no cars passed, no distant sirens. Just the faint hum of the fridge downstairs and her breathing, deepening by the second.

The room felt... soft. Like it was holding its breath.

I pulled her close.

And drifted off.





I was in the field again.

The marigolds shimmered under starlight— but the grass was gone. Only dirt now. Dry, cracked, and dark as ash.

The stars overhead burned brighter than I remembered. Sharper. Hungrier. And the sky— darker somehow, though it was full of light.

I turned to face the moon— but the moon was gone.

In its place hung the shattered corpse of a planet, fractured like broken glass, the pieces frozen mid-collapse.

A sudden weight pressed into my arms. I looked down.

It was a baby. But not.

Tentacles curled from its skull—short, underdeveloped things, limp across my forearms like damp seaweed. Its skin was gray, veined with faint pulses of sickly violet. Rotted in places, soft in others. Still warm.

Its arms reached for me, weak but eager. Its legs kicked gently, like it was happy.

There was no malice in it. Only motion. Only need.

The air was cool and clean. Almost peaceful. The thing shivered.

Then came the sound—a thin, high-pitched squeal, shrill and slurred. I flinched.

But didn’t let go.

It made the sound again—closer to a giggle now. Then: “Dada.”

Distorted—garbage-slick and wrong. But unmistakable.

 It had no face, no mouth, no breath—only writhing tentacles where lips should be. Still, it spoke.

“Dada.”

And again. Softer. Pleased. Happy.

Something inside me trembled. Not fear. Something else.

Warmth?

For a second—only a second—I swore I heard Daria’s laugh buried in its voice. Warped. Twisted. Like a cassette tape melting in the sun.  
  


 This was mine?

I was holding my baby? The thought came fast, uninvited. Part of me screamed. This thing—this impossibility—it was mine.

Then came the scream.

From behind me. Inhuman. Enraged.

The wind rose. Cold. Furious.

I curled the baby tighter in my arms, shielding it with my body.

Then— a wet touch around my ankle. A tendril. Slippery. Hungry. Rising.

Before I could move, it yanked me down.





I woke with a start. Labored breath. The feeling of something wet.

The clock read 3:12 a.m.

I sat up fast and turned to Daria.

She was hunched over, gripping her stomach, her face pale and tight. “James,” she whispered. “I think I’m in labor.”

She winced, one hand bracing against the mattress, the other reaching for me. “It started a while ago,” she said, her voice strained. “Ten minutes apart. Then seven. Now five.”

Her fingers dug into my arm as another wave hit. She hissed through her teeth. “It’s not stopping, James.”

I looked down. The sheet beneath her was damp—just enough to darken the fabric. “I think my water broke,” she murmured. Her eyes didn’t leave mine.

“Okay. Let’s get your stuff. Can you walk?” She nodded.

I dressed fast, yanking my phone off the charger and leaving the cord behind. I helped her out of bed, steadying her with one arm around her waist.

The night air was cold as I guided her to the car.

I helped her into the front seat, reclined it slightly, and pulled the seatbelt across her lap. Her breath hitched again as she closed her eyes through another contraction.

“You’re doing great,” I said, not sure if it was true.

I climbed in, jammed the keys into the ignition. The car dinged at me like it didn’t know what was happening.

I should’ve called ahead.

But I didn’t.

I just drove.

The streets were empty.





I pulled into the small circle in front of the ER entrance. No valet. No one outside. Just the buzz of a flickering overhead light.

I threw the car into park and hopped out, rushing around to open her door. Daria’s eyes were half-closed, her hands gripping the seatbelt like a rope. Her breathing had gone shallow and rhythmic, like she was counting something only she could hear.

“Can you walk?” I asked, already unbuckling her.

She nodded, jaw clenched. “Let’s go.”

I helped her out, one arm around her back. She leaned into me hard—half her weight on my shoulder—and we shuffled through the automatic glass doors.

Inside, the air was too bright. Too clean. A front desk sat under blue LED lights, empty except for a lone nurse typing something into a terminal.

She looked up.

“Hi, she’s—my wife’s in labor,” I stammered. “Thirty-six weeks. Water broke.”

The nurse stood instantly. “Let’s get you into triage.”

She hit a button. Another set of doors hissed open. A second nurse appeared, pushing a wheelchair.

Daria tried to wave it off. “I’m okay,” she said, weakly.

But she sat.

The nurse wheeled her fast down a long, silent hallway. I kept pace beside them, phone clutched in my hand, heart knocking against my ribs like it wanted out.

We turned through a side corridor and into a narrow exam room. Low bed. Machines. Plastic curtain pulled halfway across the tile floor. A blood pressure cuff hung limp from the wall.

“Hospital gown’s on the chair. Change as much as you can. I’ll be back to check dilation,” the nurse said.

She left without fanfare. Like this was just another Tuesday night.

I helped Daria out of her coat. Her nightgown stuck to her skin where the fluid had soaked through. She didn’t say much—just moved slow, steady, like her whole body was trying to stay calm for the baby.

She eased onto the bed. I sat beside her.

“You’re doing good,” I said, softly.

She looked over at me, eyes heavy. “It hurts a little. But I can take it.”

The nurse came back. She slipped on gloves, asked Daria to breathe deep, and checked her.

“Five centimeters,” she said, almost pleased. “You’re in active labor. Everything’s looking good. We’ll admit you now.”

She smiled at Daria. “Baby’s ready.”

Daria tried to smile back. It didn’t quite land. But it was close.





We moved into a private delivery room fifteen minutes later.

Dimmer lights. A window showing the dark parking lot outside. One monitor beeped softly in the corner, tracking the heartbeat of something still inside her. IV tubes coiled gently from the stand beside the bed. The air smelled faintly like antiseptic and lavender-scented soap.

I sat in the chair next to her. Held her hand.

“I can’t believe this is happening,” she said, eyes up at the ceiling.

“I know,” I whispered. “But you’ve got this.”

She looked over at me, then down at her belly. Her fingers moved slowly across the bump like she was already trying to say goodbye without knowing it.

“I can’t wait to meet him,” she said.

Her voice was soft. Whole.





Time blurred.

The nurse checked her again—eight centimeters.

Another contraction hit hard, and Daria clenched my hand so tightly I thought she might crush bone. Her breath came out in quick, shaking bursts.

“I want it over,” she whispered. “I just want him here.”

“You’re almost there,” I said. “You’re doing amazing.”

The nurse gave a quiet nod. “You’re doing great, Daria. Next one, we’ll start pushing.”

They adjusted the bed. Another nurse came in. The room shifted subtly—monitors, wires, gloves snapping on. Everything became sharper. Brighter.

Daria cried out—just once—as the next contraction hit. I wiped her forehead. Her fingers curled into the blanket.

“Okay, push with this next one,” the nurse said gently. “Deep breath. Push.”

She did.

Hard.

I watched her face twist—pain, focus, everything at once. Her free hand gripped the bed rail, knuckles white.

And then—

She stopped.

She blinked.

Her eyes widened like something inside her had come unfastened.

Her lips parted, breath hitching.

“James,” she whispered. “Something’s wrong.”

I stood.

Before I could speak, her whole body jerked.

For a second, everything stilled. She looked at me like she didn’t know who I was. Like she was slipping.

One of the machines spiked—then dropped.

The nurse's smile vanished. “Daria?”

Daria gasped, like the air had been yanked from her lungs.

Blood—too much—began spreading beneath her. The IV line thrashed as her arm went limp.

A strange sound came from her throat—wet, broken, like she was trying to speak underwater.

Then—

Alarms.

Everything blurred. One nurse hit the call button. Another shouted into the hallway. The OB team poured in like a flood.

A doctor was suddenly at her side. Orders flew fast.

“Vitals crashing—get the crash cart!” “Push epi!” “We need to get the baby out—now!” “Possible AFE! Go!”

I was still holding her hand when they pried it from mine.

“Sir—you need to step out now.”

“No—I’m not—” I started, but they were already moving.

Someone gripped my shoulders and turned me toward the door.

“She’s in the best hands,” a voice said—maybe the nurse from before. “We’ll get you when we can.”

The last thing I saw was her face.

Still. Pale.

Eyes half-lidded.

Then the door slammed shut.





I stood alone in the hallway.

The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead. A nurse ran past, pushing a cart. Far off, a vending machine hummed.

I wandered back into the waiting room.

Everything was motionless—except the clock. It ticked, loud and steady. One minute became ten. Ten became thirty. Thirty blurred into an hour. Then two.

Then the door opened.

An older nurse stepped inside. Her voice was tired. “Are you James Carter?”

I nodded.

“We need you in one of the consultation rooms.”

I stood. My knees wobbled beneath me.

The nurse held the door open.

I followed.

My hands wouldn’t stop shaking. I clenched them into fists, but it didn’t help.

“Is… is she okay?” I asked. My voice cracked.

“We need to be in a private area,” she said gently.

We stepped into a small room. Cold, neutral walls. A single cheap chair sat waiting for me.

.

“We’re very sorry,” she began, her voice soft but professional. Detached. “Your wife, Daria, experienced a rare complication. Amniotic Fluid Embolism. We did all we could… but we lost both.”

I felt something inside me throb. Not pain. Not yet. Just... a pulse.

I nodded.

She hesitated. “Would you like to speak with someone?”

“No.”

“Would you… would you like to see them?”

A long pause.

“Yes.”

She led me through a side hallway. Into the bereavement room.

The scent of antiseptic hung in the air. Soft. Almost sweet.

I stepped inside.

Daria lay on the bed. Still. Her hair brushed over her shoulder, neatly combed. Her lips closed, no smudge of sleep. Her arms straight at her sides—not folded awkwardly under her like usual. Her skin pale, too even. Her eyes closed.

She didn’t look like she was asleep.

And next to her, in a small bassinet, was James Jr.

His skin was soft pink. His head bald. His face scrunched, the way babies do when they’re new. But he didn’t move. No twitch, no stir, no tiny hiccup. No breath.

I stepped forward.

I looked down.

And I picked him up.

He was cold.

I sat beside Daria. Dragged the stiff hospital chair across the tile until it touched the bed. I reached out and took her hand in mine.

It was cold, too.

“Look, Daria,” I whispered, my throat raw. “We did good. We… we did good.”

My voice broke.

I sat there.

The room was quiet, except for the hum of the hospital’s vents and the slow rasp of my own breathing.

Eventually, a different nurse came in. She held a folder. She sat beside me, eyes fixed on the floor.

“Mr. Carter,” she said softly. “I’m sorry for your loss. But we need a few more things from you.”

She opened the folder. “These are the release forms for Daria and your baby. You can take your time. We’ll need the name of a funeral home before we can transfer them.”

“South Central,” I said.

She nodded. “We’re required to offer a memory packet—prints, a lock of hair. You don’t have to take it, but...”

I nodded again.

“And… would you like to request an autopsy?”

“Yes.”

She pointed at a page in the folder. “There are resources here, sir. People you can talk to if you need help. You’re welcome to stay a bit longer, or we can—”

“Thank you,” I said. “But I’m going home.”

I stood.

I placed Junior gently back into his bassinet. I looked at Daria one last time—memorized the lines of her face, the stillness in her shoulders, the hush in her chest.

Then I walked out.





The hospital lights brightened as I passed, The daytime lights flickering on.

The front doors opened.

The sky had begun to pale. A soft blue tint on the horizon. The streets were alive with early traffic—people going to work. Coffee cups. Breakfast wrappers. Headlights.

I climbed into the car. It was still parked where we left it, the passenger seat empty now.

I drove home.

The front door was still wide open.

I stepped inside and shut it behind me. The house was quiet. The folder thudded onto the kitchen table. A heavy, final sound.

Nothing moved.

The air felt... wrong. Like it was waiting…

I climbed the stairs.

Each one creaked under my weight.

I turned at the top, rounded the banister, and walked into the nursery.

The sky-blue walls. The cartoon clouds. The stars I’d stuck to the ceiling.

The little mobile turned lazily above the crib, catching the early sunlight. The light spilled across the room in soft beams.

And in the windowsill, set in a small clay pot, a single marigold bloomed.

Its petals glowed gold in the morning light.

I sank to the floor.

My knees hit the carpet. My body folded in on itself. I didn’t sob—not at first. Just breathed.

Then the first tear fell.

Then the second.

Then everything broke open.

A low, rattling noise slipped from my throat—half moan, half gasp. I curled tighter, hands over my head, arms wrapped around my ribs like I was trying to hold myself in.

I wept. Deep, wracking sobs that tore from my lungs and spilled into the quiet room.

I thought of her hand in mine. Cold.

I thought of our son. Still.

I thought of the stars on the ceiling and the clouds we painted badly, and how proud she was when she looked at them.

“Oh God,” I whispered. “Why…”

My tears soaked the carpet. My breath shook. And the marigold bloomed, untouched.",2,1752162850.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

I'll cut straight to the point; life has been feeling much emptier and uninteresting since I've gotten into reading romantasy. Desperately longing for love that holds on to you and never lets you go with a little (a lot) of magic and fairies and whatnot? Does EVERYONE not dream about that? So far, it's just a lot of stress and coffee and assignments and other weird stuff. 

Yes, I'm well aware it's relatively childish to want something so superficial (What do you mean I'm not a pink haired girl in love with an apple obsessed blondie who wants to protect me every chance he gets in a magical inn?), which makes it even harder for me to talk about it with anyone else.

1lwg8lx,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveIslandUSA/comments/1lwg8lx/looking_back_on_ace_and_amaya_a_different_view/,Looking back on Ace and Amaya - A Different View,"Okay, Love Island fans, let's revisit Ace and Amaya.

**This will be a long post, I'm hoping the comments, if any, engage in good faith and try to see things from a different point of view. Disagreeing is fine, reasonable mature discussion is fine; but comments like ""just say you like chellace and move on sksksks"" will not be entertained.**

**READ THE BOLDED IF YOU WANT TO GET THROUGH IT QUICKLY.**

[This was their first proper conversation ](https://files.catbox.moe/v67m2g.mp4)in episode 6

Nothing really of note. She says Ace is very respectful and has high hopes for their relationship.

[Second conversation ](https://files.catbox.moe/vc1dtt.mp4)the next day.

We get the bags of skittles moment and [the evil ace ](https://i.gyazo.com/36ced5ccaf64f51b170999ff17f30099.png)meme. They vibe pretty well, complimenting each other and the ""only thing that can clap"" meme as-well. Good vibes all around.

[Fast forward to the recoupling](https://files.catbox.moe/lqljlw.mp4) Ace picks Amaya over chelly.

""I'd like to couple up with this girl because she makes me laugh, she's gorgeous --- she's very ambitious, very assertive --- I'm really excited to share a bed with this person and have conversations late night about stupid shit."" Amaya say's that talking to Ace is very natural and she's excited.

# [That same night, we get their first argument. ](https://files.catbox.moe/b7pfrx.mp4)

Ace pulls amaya aside after their recoupling. He says that he picked Amaya and that he wanted to ""give her the chance to explore"" and he wanted to get to know her. B**ut, he also wanted to be honest and said that he was open and wanted to explore different people, and that he wanted HER to have that opportunity as-well without feeling obligated just towards him or feeling closed off early.** He finished by saying he's a slow burner and that he's not super touchy, affectionate or into kissing outside of the challenges, unless he's really feeling it and he's really intimate (with you), even says that extends towards cuddling, saying that its his first night getting to know her.

**A few things. First off, I absolutely agree with the sentiment that a lot of people have expressed, and Amaya herself, that this was absolute very early to have that conversation.** Saying all of that definitely could have waited, and he probably did not need to tell her that they were still open. But I also think Ace isn't stupid, and he isn't poorly socially calibrated, I also assume he's seen the show before. So I definitely think he had a reason to think he needed to emphasize still being open,[ MY GUESS, is that its because she was rubbing his inner thigh during the recoupling. ](https://preview.redd.it/the-ace-hate-on-this-sub-is-so-forced-v0-a0xmkshdeybf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ca98abd5866b42f5a830f8d655bd9f801240d9b)

**But I also think that Ace displayed a rare openness here that most Love Island contestants don't;** and that is from the jump expressing that he's still actively exploring different connections, where some islanders will off the rip make it seem like their couple is their entire world. We should not shame people for being honest, but I can agree the conversation itself could've waited.

Amaya say's he needn't worry about that (being locked in early/cuddling), she also says that the conversation could've waited until the next day and that it's giving player vibes. I agree with the first sentiment, but not with it giving player vibes\*\*. Ace is doing the opposite of what players do and is communicating clearly that he's still interested in getting to know other people,\*\* who we know in this case is Chelly. A player would make one girl seem like she is his world while getting to know other girls or sowing seeds behind her back. **She accuses Ace implicitly, of being a player, or giving off the vibes of one, and Ace responds to that (something he most likely takes as an insult) with just ""really, how so?""**

She doesn't seem to directly expand on how he seems like a player here but explains that she went from being on cloud nine after being picked to questioning everything; thinking they were each others top picks, she begins tearing up and saying that Ace burst her delusional bubble of happiness. There's an awkward silence thanks to editing, before ace concludes the conversation by saying

**""I respect you for telling me how you feel, I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings (it) wasn't my intent.""** He tells cameras later that he's a very understanding person, and he sees the situation from the perspective of someone (amaya) who's probably been through a lot, and wanted that feeling of being wanted, **but at the same time he doesn't move like that.** I don't think any of this from him is unreasonable, disrespectful or mean. The timing was poor on his part, but what he expressed itself wasn't bad. **He's allowed to communicate his boundaries, in this case being super physical before he's comfortable with the person, even if the person on the other end of the convo has an emotional reaction to it.**

In Amaya's case, I don't think here she was against his boundaries, but she was saddened because she realized that Ace was still interested in other people in the villa actively and she was forced to come to the sudden realization, and thats completely valid of her-aswell.

[This was the after-math of their first argument. ](https://files.catbox.moe/021wf9.mp4)  
Amaya is in tears and is explaining her POV to Huda, reiterating that she's rethinking if Ace is genuine or just picked her to be safe. Ace presumably explained the situation to the rest of the guys and reaffirms that he's not cuddling anyone until he's sure about them, but acknowledges that its tough because he knows she's probably very affectionate. After Jeremiah questions him, he reiterates what he said about not cuddling even if she asks, **and adds that he's capable of telling a girl no, believing it makes them like you more.** Some girls take issue with that sentiment, and I can agree its very young minded, but also as a man I'd add that he's not using that as a manipulation tactic as some have accused him of; r**ather, he's saying that standing firm on what you say makes you more likeable than someone who just folds at the slightest amount of tears or prodding.**

[That night, ](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/k5czoUEKjWL74IDoqbw)he asks her in bed what she wants for breakfast, she say's coffee and returns the question, but Ace doesn't want her to make him anything. **The next day, we see him asking Olandria how to work the coffee machine (for amaya), he brings her breakfast, she says ""thanks babe"" and there's good vibes again.**

# [Then we get their second argument.  ](https://files.catbox.moe/6p0w4e.mp4)

Then we get their second argument.

They see each other after breakfast, hi-five into a hug and Amaya says ""how are you babe?"" and thanks him for breakfast. He initiates a conversation and **she start off by saying she's sorry for being overly-emotional (last night) and saying she knows he didn't have any bad intentions, saying ""im sorry king.""** He says its all good and they fist bump. It looks like editing cut out most of the next part of the convo before **he say's ""It takes me a minute to warm up (to people).""** Then he asks her what he calls her partner in a relationship. She says she usually makes up a nickname, or, 'babe'.

He says *ohh*, with a smile, **and says that even babe is a lot for him.** She responds by saying **""oh my god, so you want me to stop calling you babe? Damnn.""** He says yeah, and she get visibly upset, saying that she's about to walk away because he's about to **""piss her off.""** Again, this looks like terrible editing because the conversation flow seems very unnatural, we just see him staring at her with the same look he had a minute prior. She's shown to continue with **""you trying to make it seem like im being so pushy right now.""** Ace is silent as she speaking, **smiling in a way that I interpret as he's confused or incredulous at her reaction to his communicating a simple boundary,** like he's trying to force himself to be patient here. He says that **""I want us to be able to communicate, without you feeling some type of way... the names, the touchy-"" she interjects with ""thats fine,"" and again editing seems to strike but he says ""you're very quick to respond, you know that?"" as she's interrupting him with ""touchy where?""**

She then adds in a passive agressive tone, clearly irritated, that she will respect his boundaries, won't hold his hand, call him babe and (only) call him by his name, asking if there's anything else. **Ace rightfully calls out her passive agressive tone**, to which she funnily enough responds with a very passive agressive ""am i? :)""

**There seems to be another bad editing cut as the next time she speaks its mid-sentence where shes saying ""-okay thats fine, we'll talk babe- sir,"" She accidentally calls him babe and says that ""its natural, its natural, it just came out.""** Ace is seemingly wordless, with a slight smile, but you can see he's irritated at this point. **Shes shown to continue with ""Idk what the fuck is going on, and im not liking it to be honest. I know my worth, plus the tax, i dont beg no man to see my value and try to force him to bond with me. So you can explore your other connections.""** All Ace says is ""gotchu,"" before she leaves. She later tells cameras somewhat jokingly that she doesn't know whats going on and next time to just handcuff her and sit her across the table from him. When she leaves, ace says **""did that just happen? Am i tweaking?""**

A bit later, [we see the after-math of their second argument. ](https://files.catbox.moe/3fyu0g.mp4) Ace is talking to Nic, Amaya is talking to Chelly and the other girls. Amaya sort of lies here, saying that Ace outright said ""Don't call me babe."" In an agressive tone, when Ace just 1) asked her what she calls her partner 2) said that 'babe' was a lot for him. Though I don't think the lie was *intentional*, thats just how it came off to her, it shows just how Amaya's emotions impacted the reality (to her) of what happened.

Chelly validates her saying that to her its like ""damn can I do anything?"" **Ace is recounting the situation, and Nic adds that even to him, ""babe"" is reserved for someone that he's dating reaffirming his view.** Ace tells cameras that he had an opportunity to pick anyone, **even someone he had more of a connection with (Chelly),** but picked amaya, *and wonders if he wasted his pick*. Nic encourages ace to explore his options, and Chelly encourages Amaya to tell ace that she's doing the same thing.

Its evident at this point that they are two different people with different styles of communication. Although I think things could've been fine here had Amaya taken a second to take in what he's saying and not be passive agressive towards him, **but after that Its clear Ace had mentally checked out of the coupleship**

We don't see them together again until their

# [Third argument.  ](https://files.catbox.moe/sidhuj.mp4)

Ace begins by saying calmly that he likes her and wants to get to know her, but he feels like she wasn't understanding of where he was coming from when it comes to his boundaries. Amaya says that she felt offended ""as fuck,"" saying that she ""understands his  boundaries, (but) every time (they) talk"" hes communicated his boundaries to her, **""and its like i get it, i know, i understand there's other connections that you wanna make, and I have never given you a reason you needed to withhold from that. I'm not a little kid, I get it, I understand what situation we're in.""** Clearly becoming a bit agitated as she continued on. **This is a valid feeling; but they've only had 2 conversations since recoupling,** and both times Ace tried to communicate his boundaries to her, **which, she didn't take well and led to arguments, including the present one, which, thanks to being unresolved, are about the aforementioned boundaries.**

Ace responds simply with ""understandable."" Continuing with, **""I asked you what you called your partner,"" when Amaya once again interrupts him while raising her voice saying ""yea you did, you were very smart for that, I see (what you were doing),""** im unsure of what she's accusing him of here exactly but thanks to bad editing again **it jumps to her ending a sentence with ""babe"" again, she says ""oh my god, you see? I really do not mean it intentionally. I don't ace, I fucking don't.""** Ace seems saddened or disappointed, looking to the ground as shes speaking. **She says ""Its just part of my lingo, youre' not getting what im saying."" To which ace replies ""I really don't, so make me understand.""**

Amaya says **""no, because im about to get emotional right now. You're like pissing me off, again.""** Ace is saying something directly after, we can see his mouth moving, but his actual words are muted here for some reason. Messy editors at work, again. Music plays, Amaya continues, **""you like picked me, and its like boom, okay yea i still wanna explore other connections, like damn wtf?""**

Ace is speaking again, seemingly muted and then we hear him say **""I'm not saying I don't fuck with you. I feel like I got a-"" she interrupts him, again, saying that ""you're so confusing."" As hes trying to continue, he says ""I'm telling you what I'd like, is for us to be cool.""** She responds immediately with ""what does that mean? what are you talking about?"" He elaborates that he feels like **""most relationships start off as friends, and I feel like shit can grow-"" before she cuts him off again saying that ""I can't with you, seriously.""** And at that point, we now see ace visibly irritated.

Amaya tells cameras that she doesn't think he understands where shes coming from, and that her intentions are pure even if she isn't perfect. On the couch convo we resume to Amaya doubling down on saying that ace is giving off big ""player vibes"", continuing that hes ""talking to everybody in the house,"" to which Ace just replies with ""gotchu."" **Ace tells cameras ""fuck just being in a relationship just to be in a relationship, i feel like shes so caught up on wanting to be intimate, wanting to be boo'd up so quickly. And thats not who i am.""**

We see the convo resume on the couch and he says he'd still like for them to be friends, and shes visibly very angry saying that **""he wants to be friends with everyone, this is not friends island"",** another awkward cut and she says shes over it, and that he can ""go pick whoever he wants to talk to next.""

[In the aftermath](https://files.catbox.moe/e6fix8.mp4), Ace is talking to Nic and Amaya is talking to Hannah. Nic says that Ace was being seemingly torn into. Ace is seen continuing seemingly after explaining that, **""that shit dont turn me on, that shit dont make me wanna rub your leg while we having a conversation. I didn't sign up for that, I signed up to build a connection with someone where I can be great friends, build that and turn that into a relationship.""** Amaya is explaining to Hannah, saying that Ace asked her to be friends, saying that he doesn't need to worry about that, and that she still feels like ace is her number 1 right now.

Understandably so, as she didn't really have any conversations with anyone else. She says that this is something she really does want to keep pursuing, but then we cut to Nic asking Ace if he's gonna keep pursuing her, to which Ace says flat out that he's not. He says ""I just told her we're cool, we're friends,"" and that she asked if he's still gonna pursue (her) and that part wasn't shown on cameras, to which Ace replied ""we're friends, we're cool."" And that he was scared because **""what if I said no, im not gonna pursue you?"" To which Nic jokingly replied ""yeah, you say no you're fucked, you say yes you're fucked.""**

Amaya says to the cameras that shes trying to understand his character but hes not understanding her character, **but shes still going to pursue him and says jokingly next time shes gonna put tape on her mouth and she's not gonna say babe around him.**

[Later, Ace is seen explaining the situation to the rest of the guys](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/k2lHaOCS4ty9ULDoqbA) **saying verbatim that ""We've had three conversations, and you calling me babe, can you hand me this can you hand me that? Like, that's crazy, to me.""**

[Then as they go to bed](https://files.catbox.moe/ojxgsd.mp4) we see that Ace hugs chelly goodnight, unaware that Amaya was in the room. Amaya peeps this, looks at chelly and tells Ace **""you're not gonna hug me goodnight?""** To which he replies nah, adding something too low for me to distinguish after. She just says okay before getting under the covers. **Huda hugs Amaya and then hi-fives ace, noting that he's ""not a physical touch kind of guy"" to which he replies ""nope.""**

Some people have taken issue with this; arguing that he's being contradictory by hugging Chelly or being mean towards Amaya by not hugging her.

But in his defense, I would argue that

1. He  had every reason up to this point to be upset with Amaya given their constant arguments and her cutting him off
2. He mentally was already checked out the coupleship, but he couldn't express that then cleanly without causing more problems. It was NOT the right time to tell her.
3. He clearly has known and connected with Chelly more, was comfortable with her and by this point had likely decided to pursue her full time. **We see he didn't hug Huda either, given her comment about physical touch indicating she otherwise might have.** *Boundaries aren't rigidly applied to everyone, its about who and what that person is comfortable with.* I don't think any you would argue that we are supposed to hug someone we are upset with or that we're mean for not doing so.

Fast forward to the next day.

# [Amaya gets into it with Chelly. ](https://files.catbox.moe/1z9a1b.mp4)

Ace at this point has fully checked out of his relationship with Amaya in a romantic sense, and was going to put all his energy into Chelly. He planned out a date for them, but that got interrupted when Amaya questions Chelly about her intentions. She feels betrayed because she was venting to Chelly about Ace and him wanting to pursue different connections; not knowing that Chelly herself was the other connection in question.

Not much pertaining to Ace specifically, but I still thought I'd include it. Amaya feels like the way Chelly has been moving was ""MESSY."" They have a back and forth, and the girls chime in to remind Amaya to let Chelly finish speaking because she kept cutting Chelly off. Chelly emphasizes that they (amaya and ace) have only been together for 12 hours and that she was being honest the whole time. We don't see the entirety of their conversations so its hard to judge whether or not Chelly did say she was exploring Ace specifically, unless I've forgotten something. But it ends on a passive-agressive note and this is the catalyst for the last interaction with Ace and Amaya, as Olandria implies that they got into it and this probably makes Ace upset with Amaya as he would feel like she inadvertently ruined his date with Chelly. This leads into their -

# [Fourth and last argument.  ](https://files.catbox.moe/c7d9kj.mp4)

Ace takes her to the dock and begins by saying **""How this conversation is gonna go, you're gonna explain how you feel, I'm gonna explain how I feel. We're not gonna cut each other off. We're gonna listen to understand.""** In a vacuum, this could be interpreted in a negative way on Ace's part, but there thus far has been a long precedent of Amaya interrupting not just him but **anyone she argues with, so it is entirely reasonable for him to set this rule for the following conversation.**

Amaya starts off by recounting **""Last night, we both agreed to respect your boundaries, im getting to know you, i'm getting to know how ace is, right?""** Ace responds ""I said we are going to be friends, we are going to be cool.""

Amaya continues from her POV, **""So I go to bed, you literally hug one girl, Chelly. Keep in mind, this whole time, you keep talking about yeah im open but never once did you bring a name to it, talking about, you and Chelly have a strong connection.""**

Another weird editing moment makes it seem like Ace was silent for 5 seconds as music swells and he responds with **""I told you already, that I've had a connection with Chelly. Then on top of that-"" Before Amaya begins trying to interrupt him saying ""hold on.""**

Ace finally directly responds to her cutting him off saying that **""you not gonna cut me off""** as Amaya repeats **""you kept on,""** adding that he made his openness a broad statement as she continues to say ""you kept on saying."" **Ace gets in ""everything you're saying right now,"" but lets her finish as hes staring off into the water in resignation.** She was probably muted for a bit as we hear her continue mid-sentence ""of course my feelings probably got a bit stronger after you, so that's where I was confused, and that's where I feel blindsided. So don't try to ""undermean"" how I feel."" We see her talking again but is muted.

Both of them are clearly agitated at this point. Ace hasn't even been looking at her while she's going off. Ace responds ""You're talking with your hands and you're talking over me, so I'm not hearing anything you're saying."" Amaya retorts **""okay, thats fine, we both don't hear (and understand) each other.""** Ace continues **""understood, since you don't understand what it is, Ima be very clear with you. I do not want to explore you anymore.""** Amaya agrees, ace says that he ""loves that"" and ""appreciates that"" and encourages her to explore other connections. Amaya retorts with a final ""and you done, that's good.""

Amaya later tells cameras **""clearly me and ace, we just clash. We just don't work. And I'm not going to change myself for any man. I'm happy we had that conversation because baby, the more I get to know you, the less I do want to get to know you.""** The conversation on the dock ends in mutual passive agressive ""thank you""'s. ""

Right after, we see ace do a ""heel kick"", that a lot of people took issue with and thought was cruel of him. But when you look at the entirety of their interactions, especially the constant breakdown in communication, accusations and interruptions on Amaya's part, I think Ace up to this point has been largely reasonable. The heel kick was childish and not graceful for sure, but it was probably genuine relief on his part, and she didn't see it herself.

Now I'll address some common criticisms/accusations

# 1. Ace was cruel/horrible/mean to Amaya and he never truly liked her.

To begin with, saying that ""ace never liked her"" to me seems like revisionist history and doesn't line up with how he acted towards her at first. I'll agree he barely knew amaya and his connection with chelly was stronger, but he picked amaya with genuine excitement. Doing stuff like trying to make her coffee and making her breakfast in the morning despite having an argument in the night prior, to me, demonstrate he was genuine in wanting to get to know her. He just wanted to get to know her at his own pace when he was comfortable, something he said to Iris later on, saying that couples who lock in in the first 3 days aren't real to him.

Some viewers say that Ace never liked her and picked her as a means to make Chelly jealous, because of a brief conversation with Chelly where he asks her if she's the jealous type. Which I think is an extreme reach. **I maintain Ace** ***was*** **truly interested in getting to know Amaya** ***at first***\*\*;\*\* probably until their 2nd or third argument. **He picked her because he was interested in her, wanted her to be able to continue her LI experience AND he knew that Chelly would've been saved by Austin.** He wanted to be able to explore both connections. Others say that he never liked her because of his immediate communicating boundaries, and I would argue he did that because of the thigh-touch during the recoupling. Others reach that conclusion because he was willing to, after being prompted by the other villagers, lick Chelly's chest, and hug her before, but that just goes back to the fact that Ace was clearly more physically comfortable with her and at that point was all in on pursuing only her at the time.

# 2. Ace was mean to her after their coupleship

To be fair, I think moments like Ace looking up and making a ""thank you god"" gesture when Pepe kissed Amaya almost as if to signify that he's glad shes being ""taken off his hands"" **during the BDSM challenge was needlessly childish,** although I think there was precedent for it and it wasn't overtly mean. And I don't think him saying ""hell yeah"" when Iris comes in a moment later was a dig at Amaya, I think that was just a guy being excited for hot chick he potentially gets to kiss coming in which he later confirms to Iris. When Iris kisses ace for example, Amaya said[ ""take him away"",](https://files.catbox.moe/rep6dt.mp4) **to which he replied ""oh she will."" Or moments like Amaya giving him a thumbs down during the lumberjack challenge, which was playful still. So in fairness, there seemed to be a mutually established playfully petty relationship at this point between the two.** But I don't think any of it was genuinely mean spirited on either of their parts.

The moment a lot of people point to as solidifying their hatred of Ace is when he was asking Chelly why the girls didn't choose Amaya to go home in episode 19, and is later seen talking about it with the rest of the guys. Saying ""I don't feel Hannah who deserved to go home."" There's a cut, pepe says ""thats fuckin bullshit"", in reference to Hannah going home, then Ace continues , ""Amaya should've gone home, and no disrespect to Amaya"" **And crucially here I think a lot of people missed this; there was a audio cut. The next thing he says is ""we're just different people,"" but what he said directly after his first sentence was cut out, because after he says ""disrespect to amaya,"" the word hes saying next starts with a b or an m.**  [**Here is the full clip for reference.** ](https://files.catbox.moe/nv6dle.mp4)

A lot of viewers came away from this thinking that Ace was justifying his view that Amaya should've gone home BECAUSE he and Amaya are different people\*\*; as though who he gets along with is who stays\*\*. The fact that the editors simultaneous was showing Amaya crying over feeling guilty for staying over Hannah certainly doesn't help, and its clear what they were trying to do here. But I maintain, more adamant than any claim I've made thus far, that Ace was in-fact NOT saying Amaya should've gone home because he and her have differences. He knew, unlike the girls, that Austin wasn't feeling her, and **therefor thought like the rest of the guys that she should've went home because she tried making connections and couldn't, especially over a girl who had a strong connection in pepe.**

**That's not hatred and thats not unreasonable. That's logical.**  What you could say is that by the same logic, Austin should've went home instead of Jeremiah. And I agree. But the Jeremiah thing is a separate issue altogether, but 1) We don't know if Ace himself voted for Austin or Jeremiah 2) The decision to send Jeremiah home was ALL of the boys, they didn't like him because he didn't make much of an effort to befriend them AND Huda according to multiple sources poisoned how the villagers saw him. **3) Chelly or any of the girls would've been well within their right to question the boys for sending Jere home for the same logic, but they didn't, because they didn't like Jeremiah either.**

At most, you can say Ace and the rest of the boys (because it was indeed a GROUP decision) for sending **Jere home instead of Austin were HYPOCRITCAL,** if they believed Amaya should've gone home because of her failing to make any strong connections yet chose not to send Austin for the same reason, but that DOESN'T MEAN that belief was rooted in hatred.

# Lastly we have Ace in the stand on business challenge.

I've seen people say he was attacking here there or railing against her for no reason. But I genuinely do not agree with that assessment. Obviously most it wasn't shown. But I wrote my thoughts down on that before, so I'll put those thoughts here down.

He starts off by saying. **""You're a very, very wearing your heart on your sleeve, you're very passionate when you talk.""** Notice hes not saying thats a BAD thing. How do we KNOW he's not saying its a bad thing? Because he begins the next sentence which is the constructive criticism with ""But"", it seems like it was partially edited **but he's clearly making an effort for contrast with his tone and wording in the two sentences.**

**""But when you say, babe can i grab this for you, babe, can i do this? You're coming at it very strongly off the rip. And I just wanted to slow the pace down of that. Its just a matter of meeting people at that middle ground of, what they're comfortable with, and what you're comfortable with.""**

If he wanted his entire diatribe to be critical, he would've said ""you're passionate AND you call people babe too much."" But he didn't. In this moment, he was recognizing and acknowledging the type of person she is, not saying its a bad thing.

That's not disrespectful. **He didn't call her out of her name, he didn't imply she's stupid (like austin did), he even got up to go after and check up on her when she started crying.** The way people come off when they  talk about him, you'd think he was straight up dissing her and shitting on her name and calling her a horrible person, **he didn't do any of that.** He's a grown man trying to have a dialogue. I think he genuinely wanted to try and reach a mutual understanding with her. But because she started crying and shes the fan favorite, he's the villain for even trying to talk to her in any way that isn't kissing the ground she walks on.

You can say all you want about how you think his boundary about babe or moving too fast is silly, but this is clearly something that means something to him, and a few of the other guys agreed. REGARDLESS of a social context. If you flip the genders, and you had a woman saying she doesn't want a MAN to call her babe or baby early on, yall wouldn't call it silly. **And even if its silly to you, who are you to say what someone can or cannot be comfortable with?""**

# 3. Ace ruined x's experience in the villa / he's arrogant  / controlling etc

All claims I don't agree with, but are NOT the point of this post. **My main argument is that people have created a narrative about ace specifically about his interactions with Amaya, that he was horrible to her and tried demonizing her, which is frankly not true. Ace's biggest sin towards Amaya was the timing of that first conversation; which If it had waited, perhaps Amaya wouldn't have responded that way and set the tone for the rest of their arguments.**

This post is not about whether or not Ace is trying to be a leader (I think he is naturally a leader, but he doesn't have mind-control), or about jeremiah or huda, or his height.

Nationals starter Michael Soroka’s (5.40 ERA) last 4 straight outings have seen the Over cash in spades, friends. Even in instances where Soroka only allows 3-4 runs (and that’s on a good day…) the Washington bullpen reliably earns at least as many if not more. On the other side, St. Louis starter Miles Mikolas (5.26 ERA) has allowed 14 runs in just his last 2 starts. I wouldn’t overthink this one, betting fam – take the Over to hit.

I first asked for it and my husband and i were hesitant because i was young and it was a huge change. So i backed out and then he became a drill instructor and i looked to get on meds for weight loss. This was right before the wegovy craze and my doctor refused saying weghtloss surgery is the only effective way. Which of course made me jaded towards the whole thing. Well 2 years go by and i have a new doc, and go in for random sores on my leg and a referal to get an autism test (i have adhd and have implemented autism tricks and tips and it improved my life a lot.). He says the sores are from tight pants (i wear skirts full time) says i am married so it doesnt matter if i have autism (eye roll) and then asked me why i didnt get weightloss surgery. 

At this point last year i vowed never to get weightloss surgery because i went to urgent care to get my legs checked (couldnt walk) and SHE BROUGHT UP WEIGHT-LOSS SURGERY AND SEXUALLY HARASSED MY HUSBAND. 

All this culminates with me moving and meeting my new doctor and her asking about my weight loss referral and me telling her i didn’t ask for it. She puts me on wegovy. I lose weight for the first time in my adult life. Im feeling great, and then i tell my grandma and she freaks because our family has MEN2, a condition that is the only black box warning of wegovy. I get hospitalized for mental health issues at this point, cross country move, despair of having an option work for me being taken away and now going to a ton of specialist to learn more about potential conditions i could have which took my medicine away. 

My new doctor was kind and put me on another weightloss med and commended me for still losing weight. My new endroconolgist complimented me and said i was doing good, when the new med I’m on is not as successful for those who are neurodivergent. Both she and my PCD are being super kind to me and complimentary to me and letting me take the lead with my health while encouraging me to look at my options. 

Well now im 29 380 pounds and considering it again. My endroconologist and i discussed my concerns and she was very hopeful and kind on taking either the path i am now or weightloss surgery. 

The pros for me are the pretty instant weightloss, my mom lost a few hundred pounds in 2 years, and the fact my stomach would have the part which makes me hungry cut out. 

The cons are concerns on the surgery itself, and the recovery. Plus lose skin which im sure i can get skin removal for later. Also no more pop which i am willing to give up forever but it is my caffeine drink (i cant drink coffee) 

I talked to hubby and he’s supportive. I think the difference now is our age, understanding my condtions make it hard to lose weight, but also im young and will bounce back. Hes incredibly fit and i want to run with him and body build with him, and with my weightloss he sees my desire and drive and has been proud where before i felt so defeated about it. He also can take the time off the first week of my surgery to be a support during that time. 

And idk. I feel ready to bring this up to my primary care doctor. I think she will be thrilled, and kind, and i know i can do it. Heck ive still been losing a bit of weight (start weight 397). And there is a surgeon here in my town, so not much travel. Plus with me not working (job hunting yay) i can really move through the preprocess quickly and think i could have the surgery in the 3-6 month time frame they say it takes to get to the surgery itself. 

Anyone else deal with shitty docs then get good ones which made you more confident? While i feel more confident im still wishy washy sometimes like i did promise not to do this when a doc sexually harassed my husband and another one dismissed my concerns because i am a successful woman because I’m married.

1lwg2pw,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/1lwg2pw/elimination_diet_and_constipation/,Elimination diet and constipation,"Hi everyone! I technically started the elimination diet today but I've been cutting back heavily on FODMAPS for the past several days with one or two accidental triggers. I read in my book that constipation can make it take longer for the diet to affect bloating, which makes sense to me. However, I've been taking a cupful of Miralax a day for a week or two now and I'm still very constipated. I eat a lot of protein, having a low FODMAP shake with almond milk every day with lunch. I plan on adding more fiber to my diet with raspberries (the recommended portion is only ½ a cup) but definitely need more. I plan on getting Metamucil when I get paid next week and go to the store. 

My question is if it would be worth increasing my dosage to two capfuls of Miralax a day to jumpstart my system a bit more and speed along the process of purging FODMAPS or if I just need to be patient. I already bike several miles a day and have black coffee every morning so I feel like I've reasonably tried other methods available until I can buy a supplement next weekend. I understand the Miralax box says it's intended to be taken once daily and to consult a doctor before increasing but I am not in a financial position to see a specialist right now so I'm wondering if y'all have any opinions or experiences to share.

So I start the n-tieth life, get everything in order by wednesday, and on friday I go to town for greceries in the early morning with the moped. I do some ad paper deliveries while I'm there, grab groceries for grandma and head back home. As I arrive, I see uncles van parked outside. Great success! This means I can get the tires to Fleetari, go back, and drive the tractor to drop the firewood, earn good money and enjoy the weekend freely as I wait for the tires. This will be the one!

Of course I load the van up with tires and some random stuff, speed off towards the shop and understeer into a marsh, two corners before my arrival. I try hard to get it out, but I fear it's only making it go deeper. I decide to get all the tools and stuff out for the fear of the van despawning and everything being under the surface of the mud. My thirst meter goes into red and the sun slowly begins to set, so I start walking back towards home to find the nearest water source. Luckily the drink driver comes from the other way so I decide to hitchike and drink in the main city. I arrive mere minutes before shop closes, eat, drink and gulp down two coffees before having a smoke and wait for the bus. The bus arrives, I get on and since it's my first time, an hour passes before I pay for the ticket and we go off. Its almost midnight at this point. I couldn't see anything out front as the pitch black decides to set in and the low beams do jack. Keeping a mental note of approximate turns before the southern bus stop as suddenly a thunderstorm of biblical proportions opens up just in the last bend, resulting in a complete loss of orientation and missed stop... 

Magically the weather cleareup and I was drop on the western side. Now it is pitch black and the thirst meter is again nearing  the red zone. I try to navigate via the tree tops skylining against whatever sunlight is still out there, but not for long as the thunderstorm is coming this way and soon enough I was navigating by footseps. Decided to piss into my mouth and by divine intervention I managed to see the light in the window of that farm and headed there to find the water pump. Heavy rain made it impossible but I waited until it stopped and there was some semblance of sunrise. After I got my thirst quenched, it was already saturday so I couldn't hitchike towards my house and had to walk the whole way. Somehow I made it, and my fatigue wa sshot, but I grabbed the tractor to go save the van. So much for a free weekend as I was saving the van during the rally, hoping to whatever deity to survive this ordeal.

With the van on its wheels and loaded up with stuff, I decide to take the main road to avoit the rally shenanigans. Was this a smart idea is unbeknownts to mankind as I kept falling asleep at the wheel at excess of 100 km/h. Again, magically I made it home and slept through the whole day. Sunday consitent on just getting myself in shape, doing stuff around the house and planning on how to get the tractor.

Here comes monday, I decide to go to town and get the van, organise the tire change and buy fluids for the car. Managed to do it, and got back home without any fuss. The phone rings and Fleetari says my tires are done, and soon after the sewage pumping guy also calls. Gret stuff, I get to drive the truck for the first time! I hop into the van, collect fresh tires from the shop and since I can do the sewage job, I'll do it in one take.

I fell into the well.

**What it does:** Type in any movie or TV show → Get instant custom drinking game rules + a themed cocktail recipe

**Some examples of what it's generated:**

* **The Office:** ""Take a sip every time Jim pranks Dwight"" + ""Dundie Award"" cocktail (whiskey sour with honey)
* **Breaking Bad:** ""Drink when someone says 'Yeah, science!'"" + ""Blue Sky"" cocktail (blue curaçao mix)
* **Harry Potter:** ""Sip when magic happens"" + ""Butterbeer Bliss"" cocktail (butterscotch and cream)
* **Friends:** ""Drink during Ross's 'We were on a break!'"" + ""Central Perk"" coffee cocktail

**The best part:** It works with literally anything. I tested it on obscure 90s sitcoms, foreign films, even documentaries. The AI somehow always comes up with something that makes sense!

**Weirdest results so far:**

* Teletubbies drinking game (surprisingly wholesome)
* Planet Earth drinking game (drink every time David Attenborough says something profound... you'll be hammered)
* Cooking shows (drink when Gordon Ramsay swears... also dangerous)

It's completely free and no signup required - just pure silly fun for your next movie night!

1lwfwl0,https://medium.com/swift-pal/swiftui-design-system-a-complete-guide-to-building-consistent-ui-components-2025-401ec19a2126,SwiftUI Design System: A Complete Guide to Building Consistent UI Components (2025),"Ever opened a SwiftUI project and found yourself staring at `Color.blue` in one view, `Color(hex: ""#007AFF"")` in another, and some random `Color.accentColor` sprinkled throughout? 

Yeah, I've been there too. We've all been there.

Building apps without a proper design system feels productive at first – you're moving fast, shipping features, getting stuff done. But then you need to update that shade of blue across your entire app, and suddenly you're playing hide-and-seek with hardcoded values scattered across 47 different files.

## What You'll Learn

In this comprehensive guide, I'll show you how to build a complete design system from scratch:

🎨 **Design Tokens Foundation**
- Semantic color naming that actually makes sense
- Typography systems that scale with dynamic type
- Spacing patterns that create visual rhythm
- Automatic light/dark mode support with asset catalogs

🧱 **Component Architecture**
- Building flexible, reusable components
- Environment-driven styling patterns
- Accessibility-first design principles
- Real-world button component with all states

📦 **Implementation Strategy**
- Migration patterns for existing apps
- Swift Package integration
- Team adoption strategies that actually work
- Measuring success and maintaining consistency

## Why This Matters

A design system isn't just about making your app look pretty (though that's a nice bonus). It's about:

- **Writing less code** - Build once, use everywhere
- **Fixing bugs faster** - Update styling in one place
- **Onboarding developers** - Clear patterns everyone can follow
- **Scaling with confidence** - Consistent UI across features

## What Makes This Different

No theoretical fluff. No fake personal stories. Just practical patterns with:

✅ Copy-paste code examples that work immediately
✅ Real-world component implementations
✅ Production-ready patterns from actual projects
✅ Integration with SwiftUI's existing systems

Whether you're building your first app or maintaining a large codebase, this guide will help you create a design system that scales with your needs instead of fighting against them.

Ready to transform your scattered UI code into a cohesive, maintainable system?

But I got a little in my head because like… I didn’t even realize lattes were usually 8oz unless it’s a more traditional style? I’ve mostly done American style lattes where it’s like a 12oz cup with a double shot and 10oz of milk.
So now I’m wondering when he says 8oz latte, is he expecting a single shot (~1oz) and about 7oz milk, more like an Italian style latte? Or still a double shot (~2oz) but less milk to fit the cup?
Also, the owner mentioned they’ve got this head barista who’s apparently amazing like, the guy went to coffee school and they literally had to pitch themselves as owners to convince him to join their shop. So I already know they take coffee pretty seriously and I don’t wanna mess up something basic like milk ratios on my first impression lol.
I’ve been a craft coffee barista for 3+ years so I would love to learn more about all of the “correct” measurements. 
Anyone worked in places like this? I’d love to hear what you’d expect from an 8oz latte in that kind of setting.
Appreciate the help 🫶🏼

**City Alleyways - 12 multilevel buildings**

Welcome to Cornflower Alley – a tight and winding merchant-studded artery in the heart of a bustling city.

With 12 individual buildings comprising of businesses at street level and residential use upstairs, there are 5 levels to the alley, running from cellar (with secret tunnel for the Mayor’s covert gambling habit!) right up to the very rooftops. Find meeting places, balconies, roof gardens, latrines-a-plenty, and even feathered friends!

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3520719801

&nbsp;

**Blast room - multilevel artificer**

“What, all this? Oh, I’m just making… some decorative ironwork. Yup.
What? A dread portal to another realm so I can go looting and pillaging and make a fortune from ill-gotten gains amongst a people who couldn’t possibly expect it? Who told you that? That’s silly.
…you came here alone, right? Come and hold this cable for me for a moment.”

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3521042833

&nbsp;

**The Gallery Inn - a huge multilevel pub**

Stepping in through the door of the Gallery Inn, you’ll be astounded by the sheer scale and beauty of the wide, open galleried floors and high ceilings.

(You may also want to step to the side, as nobody wants to be vommed on by someone on the upper decks)

**Chapel in the Forest - Multilevel**

1lwfvl7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SlightlyColdStories/comments/1lwfvl7/wp_i_didnt_realise_how_badly_i_had_fucked_up/,"[WP] I didn't realise how badly I had fucked up until someone from IT actually spent the mana to teleport to me, instead of requesting remote access or sending an avatar.","The air smelled faintly of burnt toast. This could have been an early sign of a stroke, or just an inattentive intern letting his breakfast burn while he was on Tik Tok or whatever brain-rot app the youth used these days. Of course, there was a third option, but I only remembered it as it began to happen to me. Blue energy crackled, either spawning from or leaving behind hazy blue-grey clouds every time it streaked through reality.

I sighed as I set my coffee down on the desk, and waited. I had taken the teleportation safety class in community college, as had all the other semi-magical citizens that had flunked out of Wizard universities. Step one was to release anything you were holding. I glanced longingly at the steaming coffee and mentally checked off the first step. It would inevitably be cold by the time I got back here to drink it. I hated reheating coffee, it never quite tasted the same, probably from some chemical reaction to heating the artificial sweetener and oily, flavored creamers.

The blue energy pulsed around me, leaving thicker and thicker clouds of blue-grey smoke enveloping me. I took a deep breath of fresh air untainted by the magical byproduct that was rapidly encroaching on my personal area, completing step 2. The next and final step was the least pleasant of the bunch, but it was also the most important.

Step 3: Stay absolutely still.

I held my breath and, like I had when I played a tree in my elementary school theater, stayed absolutely still. Unlike my younger tree-costumed self wished I could do, I vanished. Blue energy crackled all around me for somewhere between a single second and a thousand years, depending on how you kept track of time while being pulled through the astral plane like a sewing needle pulled thread through fabric. It all ended abruptly as reality returned and hit me in the face.

More specifically, I landed face-first onto the polished concrete floors of... somewhere. I didn't recognize my immediate surroundings, or I would have booked it to the nearest washroom. The blood pouring freely from my broken nose was definitely going to stain my dress shirt if I didn't act quickly.

""Steven Morrison?"" A voice asked sharply. My name echoed softly for a moment, fading away into the background noises to join the low hums of the air conditioning and ethereal squelching of magic.

I pinched my nose shut in a failing effort to stop the bleeding. ""Yesh?"" I said, struggling to speak and breath at the same time. I held my head back, trying in vain to stop the bleeding and look at the mysterious speaker.

""You have been summoned to the IT department"" the voice said, softly but magically still echoing throughout what was apparently the Internal Techno-magic department. ""For improper use of a magically attuned device.""

I finally laid my eyes on my accuser. He was a tall, lanky fellow, with a beard that reached well below his color-shifting tie. The director of the IT department himself. The lanky wizard only answered to the CEO, and frequently disobeyed even those commands. If I was in trouble with him, there was nobody above him to appeal any conflict to. This magician may as well have been death himself, beckoning for me to join him on his tiny boat.

""I, umbh, I didnbt use magi-tech"" I said through my pinched nose and blood-filled mouth. ""Do youb have a baffroom? I neeb to-""

""SILENCE!"" the Wizard bellowed, the word echoing without losing any volume in a magical show of dominance. ""The tome of food preparation was left open and unattended in the canteen, and you are the only registered employee working on that floor today!""

I blinked tears out of my eyes as I gathered my thoughts. ""But, um, sir-""

""GRAND WIZARD!"" The head of the IT department screamed. ""You will address me by my title, or I will have your tongue as potion ingredients!""

I winced at the unfortunate title the magic man had chosen for himself. I really, really hoped that he just didn't get out much, and wasn't aware of the connotation to the domestic terrorist leader with the same title. ""No, bhe intern is there tbo. I fhink his name is Kyle?""

The wizard narrowed his eyes as he stared into my very soul. ""Is that so?"" He snarled. ""This 'Kyle' is the one responsible for that burnt toast smell?""

I nodded and immediately regretted it as pain shot through my face again. ""Mmhm. Thabt or you're habing a stroke, yeah"".

The Wizard raised his arms towards the ceiling and began to speak in strange words, each syllable striking my eardrums like sandpaper and pepper spray combined into the world's worst hot sauce. I released my broken nose and clasped both hands over my ears in a feeble attempt to block out the unearthly sounds of the spell.

A blue-grey cloud began to form beside me, crackling with the ethereal blue lightning that danced between the clouds like a supernatural game of the board game 'Twister'. The clouds thickened, the lightning grew louder and more frequent, rolling and boiling and summoning the intern whose name might not actually have been Kyle. His face emerged from the cloud, coughing and waving his hand to fan the smoke from his mouth.

I froze. He wasn't staying still! Had he not gone through the employee training yet? Didn't he know the dangers-

The wizard screamed. The magical echo gave out mid-scream, turning his demonic yell into a thin man's pained whines. The smoke and electricity died out only a moment faster than Kyle's half-summoned torso did as it splattered against the polished floor, adding a tremendous amount of blood to my considerably smaller nosebleed puddle. I could only assume that the rest of Kyle was still in the break room, waiting patiently for The tome of food preparation to finish his lunch.

The wizard collapsed, clutching one thin, pale hand to his chest. His labored breathing grew fainter with each repetition as he glared at the top half of Kyle the intern. ""Why did he move?"" He croaked out weakly. ""He drained... my... mana..""

I hurried to the wizard's side, although I didn't know if I could have helped even with a med-kit or defibrillator. My CPR certification had lapsed a few years back and I had never gotten around to refreshing it. ""Are you alright?"" I asked lamely.

The wizard struggled to breath. ""No... magic..."" he whispered, before collapsing to the floor as well. He splashed in the ever-growing puddle of Kyle's blood, not even trying to keep his airways clear of the flowing liquid.

I stood and looked all around for a phone, or an exit sign, or anything I could use to contact the outside world for help. I only found solid stone walls and glowing balls of light that the magician used in lieu of light bulbs. I couldn't even find a bathroom. Did the wizard just teleport in and out of wherever this was? Could I even get out? I had to think. I had to stay calm. I had to-

The magical orbs of light began to flicker. Without their master keeping them on, they dimmed and sputtered, one by one, shutting off and leaving me in complete darkness. I couldn't hear anything anymore. I couldn't see a damned thing. The only thing I could feel was the rapidly cooling blood from all three of us.",1,1752161875.0,SlightlyColdStories,1,1.0,False

Does this happen to anyone else?

This might not be the typical post about productivity but I need to get it off my chest. I'll tell you my work schedule first:

08:00 / 09:00 – Wake up (depends if working from home or commuting)    
08:00–09:00 / 09:00–10:00 – Drink coffee, get ready for work    
09:00–10:00 – Commute    
10:00–18:00 – Work    
18:00–19:00 – Commute back    
19:00–19:20 – Eat something    
19:20–20:00 – Nap (feeling very tired)    
20:00–20:30 – Wake up, shower, unwind    
20:30–21:30 – Free time (currently working on side gig website)    
21:30–22:00 – Get ready and head to the gym    
22:00–23:40 – Gym    
00:00 – Sleep

I feel like I don’t have enough time to do anything. I currently work on a side gig, but that will end in a week or two. I want to do something productive with my time but I don’t have the motivation to do anything and I don’t know what to do either.

In 2020 I had an IG page and a yt channel that gained a bit of traction in my country for the memes I made about local celebs, but I burnt out quickly because I don’t really consume that type of media (watching celebs in my country). I liked the video editing aspect of it; I sometimes would do it for 8–12 hours a day and I wouldn’t get bored of it. I also didn’t get burnt out of editing, which was surprising. Since then, I wanted to do something media related.

I won’t lie, I am money driven. But one of my struggles is that I just can’t stick to one thing. I tried all kinds of stuff, from making beats, video editing, programming, making logos, 3D animation for music videos, doing Photoshop, made small games, etc. Some made me money, some not. The programming part stuck with me for a while and I got a job as a programmer (my current job). I liked programming a lot too, but since I got my job, now it feels like just a job and I can't program anything outside of it. The job pays okay, average salary in my country, but I want to do something bigger on the side. Like a yt channel, but I struggle a lot to find what to make content about. I tried making what I consume on yt (documentaries), but I don’t really like that part of it. I like the video editing part though. I tried making Roblox games in the past weeks, but I burnt out of that really quick too.

I want to do something that would appeal to the masses. I like that stuff. I loved when I did video editing for a client and all we would do was to analyse the watch time, what to improve, etc. And those views were like pure dopamine. Watching a video blow up over a million views. But I can’t start a channel of my own, I can’t find an idea of a niche. I also feel like I can’t find my true passion. I struggled for years with this. I still do. I stress for months at a time that I want to do something, but I don’t know what to do. I feel like I'm in a loop. A job is not enough.

maybe I'm just crazy idk

**TL;DR:**  
I feel stuck and exhausted. I’ve tried many creative things but nothing really sticks. I love video editing and want to do something impactful, but I’m low on time, energy, and direction. Feels like I’m stuck on repeat.",1,1752161718.0,productivity,1,1.0,False

*Today's special early-post map set heralds the first of some semi-regular epic multi-level builds that I'm incredibly proud of. This 5-level map of Cornflower Alley is the culmination of around 80 hours work, and I hope you can make use of it!*

*There's another multi-level map lined up for Saturday 19th - a glorious tavern with galleried upper levels - and every so often after that (including an absolute gem of a castle that has taken 60 hours so far, a graveyard with a multi-level underground cave system, a lovely chapel with a soaring high roof inside, and more!)*

*Thank you for your support, I couldn't do this without you <3*

&nbsp;

**Welcome to Cornflower Alley – a tight and winding merchant-studded artery in the heart of a bustling city.**

With 12 individual buildings comprising of businesses at street level and residential use upstairs, there are 5 levels to the alley, running from cellar (with secret tunnel for the Mayor’s covert gambling habit!) right up to the very rooftops. Find meeting places, balconies, roof gardens, latrines-a-plenty, and even feathered friends!

You can tell a lot about the city by its thoroughfares, and anyone innocently entering Cornflower Alley at one end will emerge dazed and bewildered at the other, wondering where their coin purses have gone – whether emptied in the copious selection of shops selling toothsome treats, magical supplies, armour and weapons, beer and bacon, or pilfered by felonious thugs skulking in the shadows (surely soon to be visiting the town stocks or cells).

&nbsp;

Buildings include:

* The Grand Inn

* Butcher’s shop

* Baker’s shop

* Alchemist

* Magic shop

* Town Hall (with hidden passage!)

* Grocer & Florist

* Library

* Smithy

* Jail + stocks

These tools, small but mighty, have quickly become essential in my daily culinary escapades. The Cuisinart Mini Prep Plus (model CTG-00-SCHP) is compact but capable, promising features designed to make food prep far less of a chore and more of a breeze. After putting these devices through their paces, there’s undoubtedly a lot to love, but as with anything, a few considerations should be taken into account.

**Compact Yet Functional Design**

At first glance, the brushed stainless finish of the Mini Prep Plus enhances the aesthetic of any kitchen. It’s compact enough to comfortably fit into tight countertop spaces or cabinets but doesn’t compromise on utility. I loved how light the unit felt, making it hassle-free to move around. The ergonomics of the four-cup bowl with a handle felt just right and offered a comfortable grip while swapping out or locking in the container. Topping it off is its auto-reversing stainless steel blade, which switches effortlessly between chopping and grinding modes. This design-oriented functionality truly feels like a well-thought-out gift for home cooks like me.

For such a small machine, I wasn’t expecting to be blown away by the 250-watt motor. Boy, was I wrong. This processor chops, grinds, and emulsifies with ease. Dicing up onions, garlic, or chopping nuts took very little time and resulted in uniformly sized pieces almost every time. The grind mode worked wonders for coffee beans and aromatic spices. However, the motor heated up slightly when I extended its use for larger quantities, though it wasn’t a deal-breaker given its overall efficiency. The accompanying chopper also performed admirably in quick tasks, like handling herbs or mincing harder items like cheese and carrots.

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**

What impressed me the most about these kitchen tools is how straightforward it is to use them. The one-touch push-button control system simplifies operation, leaving no steep learning curve for beginners. Cleaning, which can feel tedious with some appliances, is refreshingly simple here. Both the processor's components and the chopper’s stainless housing and blade are dishwasher-safe, saving considerable time. The inclusion of a spatula and an instruction booklet was a thoughtful touch for guiding new users efficiently.

**Highlights**

- Highly portable and lightweight design.
- Patented auto-reversing SmartPower stainless steel blade for versatile chopping and grinding.
- Dishwasher-safe components for easy cleanup.
- Comes with thoughtful extras like a recipe book and spatula.
  
**Drawbacks**

Though I found the Cuisinart Mini Prep Plus and the chopper highly practical, a couple of minor areas warrant improvement.  

- The 4-cup bowl size isn’t suited for larger batch cooking.
- The motor heats up after prolonged use.
- The plastic outer body doesn’t feel as robust as stainless steel, making it vulnerable to scratches over time.

**Product Alternatives**

Comparing it to competing food processors, the Ninja Express Chop and the KitchenAid Mini Food Processor both come to mind. While the Ninja offers a robust blade system and a slightly more compact footprint, it lacks the patented auto-reversing blade feature that’s unique to the Cuisinart Mini Prep Plus. The KitchenAid option boasts a larger bowl capacity and modern color varieties but comes with a heftier price tag and lacks the same user-friendliness in blade functionality. For straightforward chopping and grinding, the Mini Prep Plus offers a well-rounded solution, though those who need to work with larger quantities might lean toward other brands.

**Cost Efficiency**

I felt the price point aligns well with what it delivers in terms of functionality and performance. Its build quality, while leaning a bit lightweight, provides excellent utility for the size and category it occupies in the food processor market. For anyone looking for compact kitchen helpers, this processor and its accompanying chopper deliver a balance between performance and affordability.

The Climb Against Time, my summer challenge to climb 41 4000ers in one season and raise funds to develop an Implantable Artificial Kidney, started with disappointment. Here, after a good warmup stage of preparing both my body and mind in May, I was hit by terrible snow conditions.

In early June I attempted Allalinhorn through the Hohlaubgrat, mainly a snow route with a little bit of rock scrambling at the summit block. This attempt proved futile as we were bogged down by slushy snow straight from the hut all the way to 3600m where we turned around. This futility was followed by heavy bouts of diarrhea and vomiting, having contracted some stomach bug from the water or the fellow inhabitants of the dingy winter room at the Britannia hutte. Between trying to keep my immunosuppressants down and running to the toilet, days passed, and the snow that had plagued us on the approach had long since vanished in the raging rays of the early summer heat wave.

The week after, I was again in the Alps, this time to try Les Droites or the Aiguille Verte. Neither was in condition; the mixed routes were too soft and prone to rockfall, and the rock routes were too wet and filled with rotten snow. Instead, we did Aiguille du Moine as a workup climb. I was getting incredibly frustrated. I had 41 4000ers to go and here I was, grounded, without any so far. I needed a win, and I needed it fast.



Under these conditions, I accepted Freddy’s offer to try our luck at Dent du Geant. I met him in a cafe just next to the telepherique going up to the Midi. He seemed somewhat out of it, tired and hazy. He had just been up the normal route to Mont Blanc and had come down that night, slightly dazed from the exhaustion. In all likelihood, I had a similar daze, having just come down from my ‘emergency bivvy’ that I had set for myself by the Courvecle refuge at \~2700m to get a bit more acclimatization in and catch the train from Montenvers at 1800m, saving my legs almost 2000m of vertical. Two men, at two different sides of the massif, yet the same cold, sleepless night.

We went over the plan and agreed to meet in two days. We drove across to Italy over the Mont-Blanc tunnel in Freddy’s van. Here we promptly got the lift to Pointe Helbronner at 3462m to make our bivouac. The Italian side of Mont Blanc is steeper and wilder. Layers and layers of rock buttresses rise abruptly from the earth to meet the gently sweeping glaciers coming from the French side at the high summits. It amazed me that there was a path straight down almost from Helbronner to Courmayeur, a sickening amount of vertical on mostly loose rock.

# Dent du Geant

# The Bivvy

We got off the lift and could immediately see our objective, Dent du Geant or, Dente del Gigante as Italians would call it. The Giant's Tooth did indeed look like a tooth. I was used to the view of it from the French side; from there, with its sweeping North Face and its cloud perpetually lingering under it, it looked impressive. Now, with us so high up, it looked small and, importantly, attainable.

We moved slowly up the glacier towards our mountain and settled on its shoulder, off the glacier at 3600m. It was an impressive bivvy location. Only 400m below our summit, with the entirety of the Mont Blanc massif to let our eyes gorge upon. Here I started with the ritual of collecting, melting, and boiling snow.

It always amazes me how long it takes to melt and boil snow. For the subsequent bivvies with easy lift access, I decided I would bring water up from the valley and save the time and hassle. Yet the time spent over the Jet Boil was not in boredom, for there was tomorrow's route behind us, and the routes for later, in front of us, to admire.

I had met my partner Freddy on a belay at Pointe Lachenal just a month prior. I didn’t know him well, aside from the coffee shop chat, and we had never climbed together either. Yet from the get-go, I was at ease; things were just meshing well without trouble. So we lay feet to head, as two wide-shouldered men could only lie in this tent, and slept soundly.

Until we were woken up around 2 am by the sound of metal and the flash of headlamps. I opened the zip of my tent and looked up; lo and behold, a train of lights heading up the approach gully. ""What the hell? It's 2 am, are these people mad?"" I asked rhetorically. This was not a long climb, and I certainly did not expect people to start at the hut at 1 am, yet here they were, clambering up the mountain in our backyard. I suppose it makes some sense to be the first on route for such a popular climb, yet the thought of leaving the tent at such an early hour and doing most of the climbing in darkness did not appeal to me at all.

Let them, we thought. We will get going at dawn. No need to rush; let the rock warm up. As I got back inside the tent, I looked up at the Kuffner, the mythical route of my desire. It cut so steeply up the side of Mont Maudit, intimidating at this time of day, with the deathly skirts of the Cursed mountain dropping steeply to either side. It, too, had a train of lights moving up it. I hoped and dreaded for it in the coming weeks.

In our tent, we brewed up, ate, and slowly but steadily got ready. At 5:40, just on the tick of dawn, we joined the light train going up the approach gully.

# The Climb

The first part of the climb was about 250m of steepish snow mixed with some rocks and rock passages. It was not too difficult, and we had a good clear night and so a refreeze. We moved past these sections to the start of the technical climbing slowly and easily in about 1hr 30 minutes.

We looked up to see that even the first pitch had fixed ropes aiding the way. We decided to simul climb this (climb while moving together). I remember this being the hardest pitch of the whole climb. Perhaps because I was still cold and not in the climbing mindset, but tugging on the fixed line in boots, it all felt very powerful. In either case, we made it up the first pitch to the second. I led the second pitch fairly easily placing a few pieces here and there, mostly just to place something, rather than a strict absolute need to place something.

The last move of this pitch was interesting, a mantle move using huge shipping ropes to help on to a massive terrace, at the beginning of the Burgener slabs. Freddy soon joined me on the belay.

The Burgener slabs, though on every photo I have seen look intense and hard, were far from it. Massive cracks go up the rock with good places for both foot and hand. The climb is only marred by the massive shipping rope yarding up the face, detracting from the seriousness of such an objective and its beauty. Yet the ropes were there and so Tug, started to tug, all the way up the slabs to the steepening just before the summit ridge.

Here it got a bit powerful as I entered the chimney, without the ropes I would definitely need my rock shoes but in this case there was no need. The climb was also as well protected as a multi-pitch sport route. So it all felt quiet breezy. I quickly led the remaining pitch on the summit ridge to the Maddona and gave her a kiss on the forehead.



We had made it, my 1st of the 41 4000ers. There was a huge welling of relief. Finally, at-least one was done.

Soon after this I took my immune suppressants. There is always one set at 10am and one set at 10pm, summit or valley, sleep or climb, this was the 10am set.

After summiting there was only the 7 or so rappels down the south face to do. These rappels were quiet fun (when expertly done as Freddy did so) with large overhanging sections which suspended you mid air.

All in all it was a glorious start a very long adventure, where good partnership met good conditions to give a beautiful outing.

I usually drink between 5-10 cups of breakfast tea through the day but have largely cut that out. Never been a coffee drinker so no issue with that.

Day 1 -
Felt very calm, focused and productive. Was able to get lots done around the house. Actually got quite emotional as I feel anxiety everyday, and once the medication kicked in, it disappeared, and tasks felt so much easier. Just felt generally happier (not euphoric though). Only side effects were heart burn, dry mouth and loss of appetite. Only caffiene I had was around 3pm when I started to feel quite tired, and this gave me a boost to keep going. Settled fine in the evening and had no major crash.

Day 2- 
Felt calm all day, bit less of the focus but still got some stuff done. Also went and spent time with my brother and felt more engaged in conversation which was nice. Did drink a cup of caffiented tea at 12pm and another at 2pm. By 4pm I had a terrible headache and by 5pm I crashed hard and felt a bit low. I assumed it was probably the caffeine and cause I hadn't eaten much through the day. Had dinner and a protein bar and headache went away, but was still very tired.

Day 3-
Had an appointment at 10am and I was actually able to get chores done before the appt (usually I'd be stuck in waiting mode), also felt calm this day. Had no caffeine at all and ate much better this day. No head ache, was quite tired by 6/7pm but no crash this time, was actually able to socialise for the evening even though I was tired. No side effects except reduced appetite.

Day 4-
Felt the medication wore off within a couple hours and had no desire to do anything really. Still felt calm most the day, just tired and didn't want to do anything. Ended up doomscrolling for far too long - honestly just felt like a day when I was not on medication and didn't have much to do. Felt a bit low, but not worse than before Elvanse. In an effort to stop doom scrolling I tried to read a book, and just wasn't focusing, would read a paragraph and realise I hadn't taken anything in and would have to re read. Went for a walk in the evening which definitely lifted my mood, but again no change in focus and still tired. No crash this evening either and no side effects again other than reduced appetite.

Day 5- 
Decided to empty the capsule into water, drank half and the other half 1 hour later. Went for a walk after the 2nd dose, again felt good for the walk but was tired when I got home. Felt quite calm today, but quite lethargic again. Not much desire to do much and have had to really push myself to get simple tasks done, and not feeling the reward afterwards. Again no side effects today, appetite is actually a bit better today.

I have been making sure to have a protein rich breakfast, haven't eaten anything with vitamin C near taking the medication. 

I'm aware the first couple days the effects are much stronger, and I know I'm on a very low dose at the moment. I'm just surprised that by day 4 I'm not really feeling any benefit. Has anyone else found the benefits to disappear so quickly when starting Elvanse? 

The Dr who did the assessment and prescribed the elvanse did say that I would be dealing with a psychiatrist when it comes to how I'm getting on with the medication and upping the dosage. I just can't remember how long he said it would be till I see the psychiatrist. 

I plan to continue taking it daily till I speak with the psychiatrist as I'm assuming it's just too low a dose? The past couple days I haven't felt worse than I did before the medication, just feels a bit disappointing that the benefits have worn off so quickly, as the first couple days I felt so much better.

Chapter 1  
  
When I told Daxon Sterling I wanted to break up, he was still fiddling with his camera, taking photos of me.  
  
""Just because I posted her on my Instagram?""  
  
""Yeah.""  
  
He squinted through the viewfinder, smiling as he asked:  
  
""How long this time? A week or two? Don't drag it out too long, or I might actually forget about you.""  
  
Eleven years of knowing each other, and he didn't believe for a second that I'd actually leave him.  
  
But this time, I'd really made up my mind.  
  
So, when he was assuming I'd go to NYU with him, I chose somewhere as far away as possible—Stanford University.  
  
From here on out, we were to live completely separate lives, never crossing paths again.  
  
...  
  
In the coffee shop, the camera shutter clicked crisply. Daxon looked down at the screen, checking the shot he'd just taken of me, and chuckled softly.  
  
""I'm gonna use these photos at our wedding someday. Already got the album title picked out: 'My Hot-Tempered Wife Who Broke Up with Me a Hundred Times.'""  
  
I kept my face stone-cold, not in the mood for his jokes.  
  
""Ugh, why can't I ever capture that vibe when I shoot you? The other day I casually snapped a few pics of Aria and they looked like magazine covers.""  
  
He clearly wasn't taking my breakup seriously.  
  
""I'm being serious this time.""  
  
He looked up at me, the smile fading from his face.  
  
""You're really gonna break up with me just because I posted her on Instagram? Come on, Skylar, isn't that a bit much?""  
  
""No, it's not.""  
  
Of course it wasn't too much.  
  
Daxon had used the $3,000 Canon R6 I'd bought him to shoot graduation photos for our classmates, then posted them on Instagram—a whole carousel of nothing but Aria's close-ups.  
  
Everyone was gushing about how he'd captured Aria looking so pure and ethereal, and he even hyped up her ""unique aura"" in the comments.  
  
My photos? He didn't save a single raw file.  
  
All because he thought I didn't have good camera presence, that I couldn't produce any standout shots.  
  
""Okay, jealous much? How about I take a bunch more of you and post those on my Instagram too?""  
  
His tone was like he was pacifying some unreasonable kid.  
  
I took a deep breath.  
  
""You don't get it. I don't want your Instagram posts.""  
  
""Got it, got it. Look, I'll delete the post, okay? Problem solved?""  
  
I shook my head, done with his whole ""playing dumb"" act.  
  
""You're deleting the post? Could you maybe send me the raw files first?"" Aria had appeared out of nowhere at our coffee shop table, sliding into the seat next to us without even asking.  
  
She immediately picked up on the weird tension and asked, ""What's wrong? Daxon, did you piss off Skylar again?""  
  
Daxon pursed his lips but didn't say anything.  
  
Aria jumped right into damage control mode.  
  
""Skylar, don't be mad at him. It's totally my fault—I was the one who asked Daxon to take extra shots of me that day. I haven't had a proper photo shoot in forever.""  
  
She tugged at Daxon's sleeve.  
  
""You know what? Keep the raw files. Delete the Instagram post too, dude. No point in upsetting your girlfriend over something this small.""  
  
I let out a bitter laugh. ""Something small? Having my boyfriend photograph you is small? Using matching phone cases with my boyfriend is small? Sneaking around and changing my boyfriend's wallpaper to your photo is also small? Aria, I seriously don't get it—how is it that every single 'small thing' that pisses me off has you right in the middle of it?""  
  
""Since you're so into my boyfriend, he's all yours.""  
  
Aria bit her lip, tears welling up in her eyes.  
  
""I'm sorry,"" she said, reluctantly taking off her phone case. ""You're misunderstanding Daxon. We're really not what you think. I don't have parents anymore, no family left. Daxon's family is all I have.""  
  
She set down the phone case as tears started streaming down her face.  
  
Daxon shot me a reproachful look.  
  
""If you've got beef with me, take it up with me. She didn't do anything wrong. Why are you taking it out on her?""  
  
Looking at him pick up the phone case and stuff it back into Aria's hands, even reluctantly giving her hand a little squeeze—  
  
I suddenly felt completely over it all.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
I got up and left the coffee shop. I didn't want to stick around and listen to Daxon comfort her.  
  
Never thought there'd come a day when even our breakup would feel this half-assed.  
  
That night, friends had organized a murder mystery game. I didn't want to make things awkward for everyone because of the breakup, so I sucked it up and went.  
  
When I got to the door, I was a few minutes late. I could hear my friends inside complaining about me.  
  
""Is Skylar gonna bail because she's pissed again? What did you guys even fight about this time?""  
  
""Same old thing—that Instagram post.""  
  
Someone laughed dismissively. ""She's seriously mad about that? You're president of the photography club at our school. What's the big deal about taking some photos and posting them? Skylar's being way too petty.""  
  
""Right? Last time we played murder mystery, Daxon got paired with someone else for the couple's storyline and she got so pissed we couldn't even finish the game.""  
  
""If I were looking for a girlfriend, I'd want someone sweet and chill, not someone who's always blowing up. Like, Aria's perfect.""  
  
Daxon sighed.  
  
""Can't help it, that's just how she is. Guess I've been spoiling her too much.""  
  
Someone laughed. ""You keep spoiling her like that, and she'll get so bratty no one else will want her. Then she'll be stuck with you forever. Let's see how you handle that.""  
  
A soft, gentle voice drifted from inside the room.  
  
""Skylar's so lucky though. If someone pampered me like that, I'd never want to fight with them.""  
  
So Aria was there too.  
  
Daxon's friends immediately started egging them on. ""Well then, let's give you two the couple's storyline tonight.""  
  
""Really? Can I pick one where Daxon confesses to me and we have all those cute interactions?"" she asked playfully.  
  
Then I heard Daxon respond with a laugh in his voice.  
  
""Alright!""  
  
Then Daxon warned everyone:  
  
""You guys better not go blabbing about this, or my little jealousy queen will throw another fit.""  
  
I let go of the door handle and walked away.  
  
The laughter from the room behind me sounded so sharp and piercing.  
  
Daxon knew perfectly well that I had a problem with him playing romantic storylines with other girls.  
  
He'd pay lip service to worrying about me getting mad, but he never actually turned other girls down. Simply because he was dead certain that no matter how angry I got, I'd never actually break up with him.  
  
This time though, he was wrong.  
  
That night, Aria posted on Instagram.  
  
\[First time playing murder mystery—turns out growing old together is such a romantic thing. Thanks for healing me tonight with just one evening. I used to think there was nothing left in this world worth living for, but now I have a dream I want to chase.\]  
  
The photo was a group shot—in an inconspicuous corner, two hands were interlocked.  
  
I scrolled through the screen and saw Daxon's comment.  
  
\[Don't be so pessimistic. There's still so much beauty in this world waiting for us.\]  
  
I locked my phone and knocked on my dad's office door.  
  
""Dad, I want to apply to Stanford University.""  
  
He stopped working, closed his laptop, and gestured for me to sit down and talk.  
  
""What made you suddenly change your mind? I thought you were set on going to NYU with that Sterling boy.""  
  
""Dad, isn't your firm expanding to Palo Alto? I want to be closer to you. Also, I really love beaches there.""  
  
Dad could see the disappointment written all over my face, but he didn't call me out on it.  
  
""I support you completely. Putting your future first is never wrong. I was actually worried about you being so far from me for the first time in your life—wasn't sure I could handle it. Now I'm totally at peace with it.""  
  
Looking at my dad's adoring expression, I knew I was making the right choice.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
The day after SATs results came out, I submitted my application online and quickly got an interview notification for the end of the month.  
  
It wasn't until I got the text reminder that I remembered I'd bought tickets to the Daido Moriyama photography exhibition—Daxon's favorite photographer.  
  
He hadn't managed to snag tickets when they went on sale, so I'd quietly bought two at marked-up prices online.  
  
I'd planned to surprise him after graduation, but now there was no point.  
  
So I took a photo and posted on Instagram: \[One ticket to give away, first come first serve.\]  
  
An avatar I'd never talked to before popped up.  
  
""These tickets were so hard to get! Could I have it?""  
  
It took me a while to remember that it was Kieran Wilde from Daxon's photography club. He had a great physique and was always being used as a model by the club members.  
  
An hour later, I met Kieran in person at the exhibition entrance—he was really tall, with deep brown eyes and curly hair, looking pretty sweet.  
  
Several girls walking by kept turning back to look at him, some clearly working up the courage to ask for his number.  
  
He didn't talk much, but when he encountered pieces he liked, he couldn't help sharing insights about Moriyama's style and the background of various works.  
  
Listening to him explain everything, I realized for the first time how fascinating photography could be.  
  
""Can I take a photo of you?"" he suddenly asked. ""This lighting and angle—it's perfect for you!""  
  
I felt kinda shy but didn't want to kill his vibe.  
  
""Look!"" He held the camera up to my face. ""Isn't this so moody?""  
  
""Your profile's gorgeous. Can I try a front-facing shot? Let me find the right lighting.""  
  
The second he picked up that camera, he got all serious.  
  
And I loved every single shot he took.  
  
Something suddenly hit me—Daxon hadn't been this patient with my photos in forever.  
  
After we finished the exhibition, I asked him to send me the photos. Before we parted ways, I asked, ""Can I post these on Instagram?""  
  
""Of course,"" he grinned, his whole face lighting up. ""Can I post them too?""  
  
""Totally.""  
  
As I was turning to leave, he suddenly called out, ""Hey, thanks for bringing me today. Let me take you to dinner next time, yeah?""  
  
I nodded without even thinking.  
  
One the way home, I picked out a few photos to post on Instagram.  
  
I remembered the first time I met Daxon—he had a camera in his hands too.  
  
Back then, I was only seven, Mom had just passed away, and Dad was drowning in grief. Sometimes he'd just sit at home all day, completely zoned out, no bandwidth for me at all.  
  
I didn't dare cry at home—I was afraid it would make Dad even more heartbroken. I could only squat alone in the neighborhood garden, watching ants move while wiping away my tears.  
  
Daxon poked his head out from behind his kiddie camera and handed me a candy.  
  
""Don't cry, okay? You look way prettier when you smile.""  
  
From then on, he'd always drag me along to photograph dewdrops and flowers.  
  
When Dad couldn't deal with me, he'd bring me to his house for dinner.  
  
Seven-year-old Daxon asked me, ""Skylar, will you be my exclusive model? When I grow up, I'll throw you your own exhibition.""  
  
I nodded like I sort of got it, letting him pull me around for photos.  
  
From then on, every birthday, he'd take commemorative photos of me.  
  
But on my 17th birthday, he didn't—  
  
That day, Daxon's mom's best friend died in a car accident. Before she passed, she'd entrusted her teenage daughter to her.  
  
From that same day on, I lost my annual birthday photos and lost all the special treatment I used to get from Daxon.  
  
The phone ringing snapped me back to reality.  
  
Daxon's voice was pissed off.  
  
""Skylar, enough already. Kieran posted all those photos of you—what do you think that makes me look like?""  
  
""What?""  
  
""Don't play dumb. I gotta hand it to him though, he's really playing along with your little act. Guy's literally the campus heartthrob—who's gonna believe he's actually into you?""  
  
I had no clue what Daxon was talking about. I put him on speaker and scrolled through Instagram.  
  
Turns out Kieran had posted nine photos of me with the caption:  
  
\[In light and time, you are the most special existence.\]  
  
""It's just a few photos on Instagram. Daxon, isn't that a bit much?""  
  
Listening to the long silence on the other end of the phone, I just felt like it was ridiculous—guess he finally knew how it felt.  
  
""Daxon, can you help me with my dress zipper? I can't reach it."" A sweet female voice came from the other end of the phone.  
  
I chuckled. ""Better go—can't let Aria catch cold.""

I’m a security guard, working 12-16 hour shifts at this remote site with NO breaks. I mean, none. I’m stuck in a tiny office, alone, monitoring cameras that half the time are blurry or straight-up offline. I don’t get a lunch break, no coffee runs, nothing—just me, a chair, and a work laptop that’s older than my grandma. The client expects me to be a robot, sitting there staring at screens for hours on end without losing my mind. It’s inhumane.
So, yeah, I messed up. I was watching some adult films on the work laptop during one of my graveyard shifts. Sue me for trying to stay awake at 3 AM after 14 hours of staring at a parking lot with zero activity. I didn’t even think the office camera was working—it’s this ancient thing in the corner that hasn’t blinked in months. Turns out, it does work, and the client somehow got footage of me. Now they’re threatening to dock my hours, saying I “violated company policy” and “misused company property.” Are you kidding me?!
I’m not saying I’m a saint, but docking my hours for this? When I’m out here grinding with no relief, no backup, and no breaks? I’m basically chained to this desk, keeping their property safe, and they’re gonna punish me for a moment of weakness? I wasn’t even slacking on the job—cameras were still up, I was still doing my rounds (when I’m allowed to leave the desk, that is). This feels like a massive overreach. They’re acting like I burned the place down when all I did was try to cope with the mind-numbing boredom they’ve forced on me.
Has anyone else dealt with this kind of BS? Can they even legally dock my hours for something like this? I’m already underpaid for the hours I put in, and now they want to take away what little I earn? I’m tempted to quit, but I need this job. Any advice on how to handle this with the client or my supervisor? I’m so done with this nonsense.

Chapter 1  
  
In the fifth year of our marriage, Damon Austin set his sights on an ice-cold goddess.  
  
To win her favor, my husband started giving me pure gold roses.  
  
With each rose he gave me, my love for him would be drained away and transferred to her, making her fall deeper in love with him.  
  
But he didn't know that once all my love was extracted, my feelings for him would disappear completely.  
  
So when he gave me the ninety-ninth rose, I asked for a divorce.  
  
He scoffed dismissively. ""You want to divorce me just because I gave you roses?""  
  
I looked at him with a blank expression, like I was staring at a stranger, and said flatly, ""No. It's because I don't love you anymore.""  
  
When I said this, Damon Austin acted like he'd heard the world's biggest joke.  
  
The contempt in his eyes deepened. ""Scarlett, I've told you before—I just enjoy the thrill of bringing down women who think they're above everyone else. I don't love her. I'll get bored of her soon enough.""  
  
""I was planning to dump her and come back to our family in a month, but since you're being unreasonable again today, I'll extend it another three months. If you keep making a scene, I'll keep extending the time I spend with her.""  
  
After half a year, hearing his shameless words again, my heart felt nothing—not even a ripple.  
  
Half a year ago, when Damon gave me the first pure gold rose, he and Amara Clark barely knew each other.  
  
Back then, she was proud and alluring, looking down on everyone.  
  
Women like that always triggered men's desire to conquer them.  
  
So when I found out Damon was giving me love-transferring golden roses to win her favor, I went completely insane and smashed our entire house.  
  
I cried desperately, asking him over and over: ""Damon, is being faithful really that hard for you?""  
  
Faced with my breakdown, Damon remained like a detached spectator, his eyes showing no emotion.  
  
After hearing my words, he stayed silent for a long time before sighing: ""Scarlett, I love you deeply, but don't you think our life is too peaceful? What's the difference between a life without excitement and being dead?""  
  
He earnestly promised me, saying firmly: ""Scarlett, don't worry. No matter how I play around with other women, you'll always be my number one. You're the only one I love.""  
  
The second time he gave me a rose, afraid I'd be upset, he bought me the latest designer bag.  
  
He took me to see the first spectacular fireworks show of my life.  
  
Back then he said: ""Scarlett, just wait a little longer. Once I'm done playing with her, we'll have a child. I'll be a good husband and father—I'll never let you suffer again.""  
  
The third time he gave me one, he casually had his assistant deliver a randomly purchased LV necklace.  
  
He told me: ""Work's keeping me busy, I don't have time to spend with you. If you need anything, contact my assistant directly.""  
  
Then he turned around and took Amara to Antarctica to see the aurora, kissing her passionately under the northern lights.  
  
But he didn't know that as his relationship with Amara heated up, my love for him was gradually fading away.  
  
Now, Amara had fallen in love with him and couldn't live without him.  
  
But I had forgotten what I was like when I used to love him.  
  
At this moment, I looked up at the familiar yet strange man before me, composed myself, and said: ""I'm serious, Damon. I don't love you anymore. Let's get div—""  
  
""Enough! Are you angry because I didn't spend your birthday with you last month? I've explained it countless times—I was too busy with work and forgot. Didn't I buy you tons of gifts to make up for it? How long are you going to keep this tantrum going?""  
  
Before I could finish, he interrupted me with fury blazing in his voice.  
  
But he'd forgotten that on my birthday, his trip home to meet Amara's parents had been posted online and became a trending topic.  
  
Looking at him—full of lies without a single truthful word—I said coolly: ""Damon, don't make me regret ever knowing you.""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Originally, I was the one who pursued Damon.  
  
Back then, I was the most unremarkable among all his admirers.  
  
Compared to his other pursuers, I was plain-looking, ordinarily capable, and from a modest family background.  
  
Nobody around us expected that someone as picky as him would end up choosing me.  
  
Many people said he picked me because he'd seen too many beautiful women and developed aesthetic fatigue.  
  
But only I knew the truth.  
  
He chose me simply because I was obedient enough, compliant enough.  
  
He never considered that my obedience and compliance came from loving him enough to accept everything about him.  
  
Before, when I loved him, I would unconditionally forgive him no matter what he did.  
  
But now, I suddenly felt some regret—regret for ever knowing him in the first place.  
  
Hearing my words, Damon's eyes flashed with bewilderment.  
  
He seemed to have never imagined I would say such things to him.  
  
""Scarlett, what gives you the right to say that to me? Have you forgotten that you were the one who pursued me first, and I—""  
  
Before he could finish, Amara called.  
  
Except it wasn't his phone ringing—it was mine.  
  
Right in front of him, I answered the call.  
  
The next moment, Amara's icy voice came through the phone.  
  
""Tell Damon I'm waiting for him downstairs.""  
  
She hung up immediately, giving me no chance to refuse.  
  
This wasn't the first time she'd made me relay messages to Damon.  
  
The first time she called, I didn't answer and didn't tell Damon.  
  
That night, she got into a car accident.  
  
Her left leg was completely shattered.  
  
When he found out, he not only gave her the anniversary gift he'd prepared for me, but also didn't come home for half a month straight.  
  
He didn't even send a single message.  
  
Later, when I confronted him heartbroken, he said dismissively: ""If you'd answered her call that day, she wouldn't have gotten into the accident. You're the reason she almost lost her leg—what's wrong with giving her some gifts as compensation?""  
  
Snapping back to reality, I relayed Amara's message to him.  
  
""She's waiting for you downstairs now. You should hurry down—don't keep her waiting.""  
  
I stood up indifferently and handed him his jacket from the couch.  
  
Seeing this, Damon seemed momentarily stunned.  
  
Usually when Amara called to summon him back, I would throw a huge tantrum.  
  
I would threaten him dramatically.  
  
If he walked out that door, he shouldn't bother coming back.  
  
Though he had never once stopped for me.  
  
Now, not knowing what he was thinking, contempt flashed in his eyes as he sneered: ""Keep up this act. Sooner or later, you'll be begging me to come back.""  
  
With that, he roughly grabbed his jacket and walked out the door without looking back.  
  
I paid no attention, turning to go back to the bedroom to pack my luggage.  
  
He didn't know that the moment I decided on divorce, I had already bought a plane ticket to France.  
  
Soon after, just as I was putting clothes into my suitcase, my best friend Lily suddenly called.  
  
As soon as I picked up, I heard her indignant voice.  
  
""Scarlett, Damon is such a scumbag! He's actually having car sex with someone in your car by the roadside! I just saw it and thought you were in the car, so I went to knock on the window... I can't take it—just thinking about that scene makes me want to go blind.""  
  
As she spoke, she sent me the photos she'd taken.  
  
In the picture, a shirtless Damon was protectively holding a woman with an unnaturally flushed face, his expression dark.  
  
They seemed to have just reached a passionate moment, pressed together like conjoined twins.  
  
But I noticed the car they were using was the first gift he'd given me in our first year of marriage.  
  
I looked at it silently, my heart completely calm.  
  
As if the people in the photo had nothing to do with me.  
  
I looked away and said coolly to comfort her: ""Don't be angry. I'll be divorcing him soon. Whoever he's with has nothing to do with me.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
After I said this, Lily was absolutely stunned, asking repeatedly: ""How did you suddenly become so enlightened? Are you serious or are you lying to me?""  
  
""It's real. I've already asked him for a divorce.""  
  
A marriage without love is like scattered sand—it falls apart at the slightest breeze.  
  
So regardless of whether he agrees or not, I'm determined to get this divorce.  
  
Realizing my resolve, Lily was overjoyed.  
  
However, I never expected Amara to contact me again the next day.  
  
She asked me to meet at a café outside the mall.  
  
As soon as we met, she cut straight to the chase, brazenly saying: ""I don't want to be a mistress. You should divorce Damon.""  
  
If this had been before, I definitely would have lashed out at her.  
  
But now, I took a light sip of my coffee and asked calmly: ""If you don't want to be a mistress, why don't you break up with him?""  
  
Amara laughed softly, speaking with a smug tone: ""Because I love him, and he loves me too.""  
  
Hearing this, I laughed inappropriately.  
  
During all these years with Damon, this was the line I'd heard most often.  
  
Every woman who'd had a fling with him thought they were truly in love.  
  
Including me.  
  
I once naively thought I was different in his heart.  
  
I did everything perfectly, taking care of him with meticulous attention.  
  
I tried to earn his love with my sincerity, hoping to grow old together and live a loving life.  
  
Only later did I understand that he was selfish—he loved no one but himself.  
  
I opened my mouth, about to say something to her, when I saw Damon storm into the café from outside.  
  
Like a protective eagle, he urgently shielded Amara behind him.  
  
His sharp, hawk-like black eyes stared at me with vigilant warning.  
  
""Scarlett, yesterday you threatened me with divorce, then had your friend take photos, and now you're secretly meeting with Amara behind my back. What exactly are you trying to do?""  
  
Hearing the word ""divorce,"" Amara's eyes flashed with hidden anticipation as she asked excitedly: ""Really? Damon, are you getting divorced?""  
  
Hearing this, Damon's body stiffened slightly.  
  
But when he noticed my gaze, mockery appeared in his eyes as he put his arm around her waist and said softly: ""Of course. How could a woman like her—with no figure and no looks—be worthy of me?""  
  
As he spoke, he deliberately shot me a challenging look.  
  
I nodded in agreement.  
  
I said sincerely: ""Yes, only someone like Miss Clark—tall, beautiful, and stunning—could be worthy of the handsome and charming Mr. Austin.""  
  
I thought I was complimenting them both.  
  
But I didn't understand why Damon's expression grew even darker after I said this.  
  
He left with Amara without saying another word to me.  
  
I wanted to ask him when we could go prepare for the divorce.  
  
I sent the message, but received a glaring red exclamation mark.  
  
Once again, just like before, whenever he got upset, he would block me and delete all my contact information.  
  
Every time, I would swallow my pride and beg him to remove me from his blacklist.  
  
Now, I quietly followed his example and deleted all his contact information.  
  
From the moment I stopped loving him, I would never coax him again.  
  
If he cared about me even a little bit, he would have noticed when he gave me the tenth golden rose that I had long stopped caring about him.

My car broke down, and they let me borrow their second car for about three months. They probably would have let me keep it even longer, but I felt bad about how long I had had it already. I don't have a ton of cash at hand to buy anything too expensive, but I wanted to get them something. They are also the kind of people who just buy all of the things they want (with the exception of one or two items that are far outside of my price range). 

I had planned on getting them a gift certificate to cover the cost of their next oil change (which doesn't really feel like a gift since I used the car for so long - it feels more like paying for the oil I used). Any other ideas? I could probably spend around $150. 

For some background, they are in their mid-30s and have two young kids and a dog. I've offered babysitting MANY times, and they rarely take me up on it. They also still try to pay me when they have taken me up on babysitting. They like outdoor activities, although they haven't done too much in recent years because of the kids. They both like to bake.

I genuinely do. But I also love being able to sit down, get some work done, and pick up my coffee without having to step over a dog’s food and water bowls in the middle of a crowded store on a rainy day.

This happened today at the Wayland Square Starbucks, where a woman brought her small dog inside and set up an entire feeding station right in front of the pickup counter. Not off to the side. Not near a table. Literally smack in the middle of the floor where everyone walks. Full-on water bowl and food bowl. It was like she decided Starbucks was her personal living room.

The dog wasn’t a service animal—it was on a leash, jumping up at people (cute, not scary), pulling around, and clearly untrained.

I’ll probably get downvoted for this, but have we forgotten that people might have allergies or legit phobias of dogs? And beyond that, how is it even remotely sanitary to have a wet dog and its food bowl running around inside a restaurant?

I totally get wanting to bring your dog places. But this level of entitlement was next-level. It was inconsiderate to everyone in the store—including the staff—and completely against Starbucks policy.

Again, not the dog’s fault. The dog was just being a dog. But hopefully someone out there agrees this woman could stand to be a little more considerate.",90,1752160695.0,providence,38,0.93,False
1lwfcxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/firsttimemom/comments/1lwfcxy/aio_dr_not_concerned_about_my_pp_high_blood/,AIO? Dr not concerned about my PP high blood pressure readings,"As titles states. Background - I had a very healthy pregnancy. I was just a few pounds “overweight” when I got pregnant. I gained about 45 lbs when I was induced at 37+1 weeks due to high blood pressure that developed around 35 weeks. No pre eclampsia, but SUPER high BP that even landed me in the hospital. I am currently below my weight I was before I got pregnant even.

I’m 4 months PP and my blood pressure is STILL high. Used to be easily 120/60. Now, it has been in the high 130/80 s since I gave birth. OB has sent me to family medicine. I have developed chest pains, get starry vision & even light headed, every single day. We ordered blood work, all is normal. My doctor told me last time “you have anxiety? It must be that” & sent me on my way. I eat pretty well, don’t drink a lot of caffeine (I’m lucky to finish 1 cup  of coffee). I feel like there should be more concern, especially since my mom has a bad heart? But I am not a doctor - maybe I am over reacting? Maybe I should see a different doctor?

I have had anxiety since I was a teenager. I’m 27 now - it has never caused me to have continuous high blood pressure readings & the above symptoms. I also, was not a mother before. So, I am not sure. Has anyone else developed high blood pressure after giving birth? If so, did it just go away on its own? What was your experience?

My partner and I (both 21), have been together for a year, we're both in our last year in college and have the same course (pre med)
 
QUITE A LONG POST AHEAD IM SORRY 

A bit of context:

My partner has enough privileges and connections to get by, so many friends and has the mindset, ""live as if you'll die tomorrow"" and says he doesn't think much of the future and wants to keep doing things he enjoys, he doesn't do that well in class and fails occasionally but manages to get to the next year anyway. Im quite the opposite, I care about the little things and despite having mental health problems I still thinking about my future.

Main context:
My relationship with my partner was great, he's an easy-going guy that lives life to the fullest (sometimes maybe a bit too much), loves good vibes, a good listener, has great passion for music, kind, gentle, patient

But not everyone is perfect, and no matter how great of a person someone is, doesn't make them right for you.
Just as they say, ""Love isn't enough""

The romance hasn't really been...""there""? Yes we are always intimate, sex, cuddles, kissing, you name it
But the sweetness, the flirting, compliments, have been long gone, and yes I have opened up about this to him many times but nothing really changed
It isn't a requirement to post on social media about your partner, but i've communicated about how it's special to me... how I would love it if there's just a short message or caption along with a photo of me or us he finds cute, but he doesn't take any pictures of me either...deep conversations aren't there anymore, he's neutral about many issues or political stuff but I take stands and we don't argue intensely about these topics yet I believe that it's important to be on the same page with core values

I have always been such a detailed person, as much as I want to believe that opposites attract, sometimes they just don't work pretty well

So when it comes to showing love and care, whenever I would notice he feels off or ill, I would ask and give suggestions to manage his sickness, prepare the remedies or buy medicines needed

When he needs things like clothes, gadgets, accessories, or anything else that will provide him convenience, I spend hours looking for the perfect items for him
When there's holidays, im the gift giver because im able to manage my finances more, coming from a family with unstable income, so im not materialistic at all and value effort and presence among anything. Saying all this, I still wish he made efforts in saving up to buy me a present, or maybe made me/covered a song, or even just treating me to a nice place not just he was craving a certain dish. Hell even just picking flowers outside and making a tiny bouquet is enough! Anything! 

I do as asked or requested, even without request, massages, cooking him snacks, making coffee, getting water, cleaning his room, folding and putting away his clothes sm things that seem mundane but feels good when doing it for your partner

He appreciates all this, does some of them as well, but it seems like its become a routine or something we got used to doing 

And most of these things? he wouldn't do if not asked (esp chores). I would understand if we're exhausted or just tired and want to rest, but most of the time we're just laying down together scrolling on our phones.
He won't throw a fit or show any form of dislike towards doing these said things like chores and such, but I fear that when we eventually get our own place, I would be doing all the work, and/or the initiative wouldn't be present

We recently went on a trip, I planned and paid for the whole thing, and that isn't really an issue but...it would be great if there was initiative to help? And not just say ""let's just see when we get there""

He spends most of his time practicing for bands, thats great! I would love to have a passion of my own but never truly found it yet. I support his gigs by going when he invites me (he always does and it makes me feel included) yet he isn't really willing to drop those things just to have a bit of time with me, even if we haven't seen each other for a while or I waited for him for hours at his place, or would say these when i showed disapproval in any form; ""then ill just never play/practice/go out anymore"". But i would drop my games for him, cancel on plans with people or decline invites if it means spending time with him, I just wished he felt or did the same. I wondered if maybe he has a fear of missing out, having something that you believe is the one thing youre good at (acc to him), music is just a different fulfillment for him. When it's his friends inviting him he will go there in a blink of an eye, but when its me inviting to do something, there will be delays or ""we'll see"" or ""maybe next time"". His reasoning would be that ""we don't know how long we'll be together with our friends so we should make the most out of it"", but what about me? He says we're always together anyways, but we don't really ""do"" anything and just stay at home, he wouldn't make plans to date or hang out either 

I have asked many times if it was a burden that I always opened up about issues with anything or lapses in our relationship that im seeing, he would always just say ""its fine"" ""its okay"" ""no problem"". He always just accepts everything and says yes... I asked if it was a burden on him having to update every few hours or when he's no longer busy, which he has done consistently for a year, he said its fine its not a burden but then recently opened up that it gives him peace of mind that he no longer has to do it because of our ""space"" and no contact, which hurt to hear... 

Im starting to accept that he'll eventually decide on ""growing apart"" since he has mentioned that thats what his decisions are leaning towards to. It all started when he got too busy with practices, we started seeing each other less (we're together almost everyday), I suggested no contact, then he cried for the first time and apologized for his lapses, and that he was unable to provide me the support or treatment I needed and wanted, and that maybe we had to grow apart and focus first on self improvement


TLDR: Happy with partner, respect, trust, love is there, but I feel unfulfilled. No more romance, compliments, flirting, also kinda sexually incompatible. He tends not to give effort in many things or stopped doing so, I have also realized how unsatisfied I truly am. Perhaps we have quite different views on life and emotional awareness, personal deep rooted issues we have to fix. I was truly happy, but the satisfaction or fulfillment wasn't there, at least not anymore, and he's unable to handle my downs. He wants to enjoy his life first and focus on himself and is leaning towards wanting to grow apart so I could also focus on myself and finally get therapy because he is unable to provide the support and treatment I need. A part of me wants to start a new but maybe it really is time to let go and move forward",1,1752160558.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I’m a 20-year-old college student currently living and studying in Mainland China. I’m here hoping to connect with people from around the world and maybe make a few genuine friends.
A few things about me:
	•I love making coffee, mostly pour-over/filter style. Still very much an amateur, but it’s a fun daily ritual 
	•I enjoy cooking and making desserts — nothing too fancy, just trying out new recipes from time to time 
	•Been playing soccer for years. Big fan of Germany and Bayern Munich 
	•Music is a big part of my life — Taylor Swift is my favorite, but I also admire Kanye’s artistry. I know, quite the contrast 😅 I also enjoy jazz, classical, R&B, and rap.
	•Favorite director: Eric Rohmer . Favorite movies: Her and Aftersun. I like slow, emotional films — not really into horror.
       •I read when I can, especially literature . I also watch F1 when the season’s on.
       •I like rainy days. Prefer winter to summer 

I’m quite sensitive and tend to overthink — maybe not the “typical guy” stereotype. I sometimes worry about my future, and I struggle with anxiety now and then. I try to stay kind even when it feels like kindness doesn’t always pay off. Maybe that makes me a fool — but I’d rather be a kind fool than a clever jerk.

If any of this sounds interesting to you, feel free to DM or comment! I’d love to learn more about your country, your daily life, or whatever’s on your mind. We can talk about movies, music, football, or just life in general :)

Working the overnight shift at Cosmos gas station wasn’t exactly a dream. It was mostly blinking fluorescent lights, stale coffee, and the kind of silence that made you think too hard. But it paid the bills (barely). Most of all — it gave me time to breathe and think. Beyond the late night motorcycle drifters, after-hour workers and the occasional kid trying to buy liquor with a fake ID — I was mostly my own company. Which I enjoyed.

Until *he* came.

He started coming in during my third week on the job. I remember the first time clearly—it was exactly 3:04 AM — I know because I had been staring at the time glowing red on the register screen. Bored, I guess. The bell above the door dinged, and in shuffled this short, old man. He wore a faded Army jacket, a baseball cap with a cracked brim, and shoes that looked older than both me and him combined. *Real* old.

He didn’t say much at first. Just bought a black coffee and a pack of peppermint gum.

“You know,” he said as he slid a crumpled five across the counter, “you can tell a lot about a person by how they treat a cashier.”

I raised an eyebrow. “Is that right?”

He nodded, eyes twinkling. “Folks who say please and thank you are rare these days. Rarer than good presidents and honest mechanics!” 

He laughed a big raspy laugh. Amused I guess by his own sentiment. And just like that, he left.

The next night, same time—*ding.* He was back. This time he bought a honey bun and told me never to lend money to a friend unless I was okay never seeing it again. “It ain’t about trust,” he said, “it’s about human nature.”

Night after night, he came in. Always around 3 AM. Always with something to teach. He talked about everything—love, loss, war, forgiveness, fried chicken, the best kind of boots for walking through hell. He told me stories about old dogs and older women, jukeboxes and jail cells.

At first, I thought he was just lonely. Maybe he was. But over time, I started to look forward to those visits. I’d pour his coffee before he walked in. I’d have a question ready—What’s the worst mistake you ever made? How do you know when you’re really in love? Why do people lie to themselves?

He’d chuckle, scratch his beard, and always say the same thing: “Good, good. It’s good to ask questions gal! You can take the answers and fortify the soul!”

He was like a vintage therapist. I suffered from anxiety and depression during that time. Some days I didn’t even want to get out of bed. But come midnight, I was always excited to start my shift. Because I knew only a few hours later, he’d be there. But one night… he just didn’t show.

3:00 came and went. Nothing. I waited until 3:30. Nothing. I was worried about him. Maybe he was sick. Maybe he slept through it. Maybe he found a gas station with better honey buns. But the next night, and the one after that—still nothing.

Weeks passed. I kept checking the clock, pouring a second cup of coffee out of habit. But he never came back.

Then life did what it does—it moved on. I got a job offer in Charlotte. Better pay. Daytime hours. I was packing up boxes and ready to say goodbye to the ghosts of this little town.

On my last day, I stopped by Cosmos. Just to say goodbye to the crew. There was Miss Diane, restocking the chip aisle. She’d worked there for decades, knew the station better than the back of her own hand. “Can’t believe you’re really leaving sweetie,” she said, hugging me tight.

“I know,” I said. “I’ll miss this place more than I expected… You know, it’s funny. I can’t stop thinking about this one customer though Diane. Really old guy who used to come in late. Said the wildest things, but he always made me smile — and think.”

“Awww. Don’t I know it.” She replied. “Our regulars are all something else, I love them to death!” She replied with a warm smile, placing a box of Cheez-Its on the shelf.

“Yeah… I hope he’s alright though. He was so freaking fragile. That army jacket looked like it was swallowing him whole.” I chuckled to myself. 

She paused. “Army jacket? Wait, did he have a little limp in his walk?”

“Yeah! You know him?”

She gave me a strange look. “Sounds like Old John.”

“John?” I realized in that moment that I had never gotten his name.

“Yep. Old John McCaster. Lord, I haven’t said that name in a while.” She leaned on the counter, eyes misty. “He used to come in when I was a teenager. Always late at night. Said it was the only time the world was quiet enough to hear your own thoughts. A war veteran, I heard.”

I blinked. “Wait… what?”

She nodded slowly. “Yeah. He died back in the ’80s. Hit-and-run, right on 4th and Maple. Police found him. Said he must have been walking home…” She paused to shake her head. “Poor John. Said it happened around 3 AM.”

The blood drained from my face. “No, that… that can’t be. He was here. Like… *Here*!” I emphasized, pointing to the floor.

She looked at me like you’d look at someone who’s trying real hard to explain thunder to a goldfish. “Baby, lots of folks around here claim to have seen Old John. Especially those working the graveyard shift. Don’t let it spook you. If anything, he just liked good company.” She smiled like nothing was wrong and just went back to stocking the shelves.

I didn’t say much after that. Just stood there, thinking about his last visit.

“Don’t be afraid to leave things behind,” he had said. “Some people stay in one place so long they rot before they’re buried.”

I never asked what he meant. But now, I think maybe he knew. Maybe that was his goodbye. 

I gave Diane a final hug and a kiss on the cheek and hopped in the car for Charlotte.

It’s been years now since I’ve thought about John or that little slice of home I had at Cosmos. But every once in a while, If I find myself lost in thought, contemplating the heaviness of the world— I swear, I can almost hear the bell above that gas station door. Like a quiet confirmation to trust myself, and that every thing will be okay...

She was running.

Not toward anything. Just away.

From the truth. From the gaping absence. From herself.

The city blurred around her, streaks of light and color smearing like wet paint on a canvas she couldn’t hold onto. Neon signs. Pedestrian crossings. Horns. A child’s laugh. The scent of grilled meat from a stall. None of it registered. It was like her brain had turned the world’s volume all the way down, except for the thundering of her own heart.

*He's gone.*

Each footfall pounded the thought deeper into her skull, a metronome of grief. *He's gone. He's gone. He's gone.* Her lungs burned, sharp and metallic. Her eyes stung, her throat was raw. But she didn’t stop. Couldn’t.

*How could he just disappear? Just leave without... without saying goodbye? Without waiting? Without fighting for us?*

But hadn’t she been the one who didn’t fight?

She ran harder. As if punishing her body could atone for her silence.

*You waited too long. You waited too long.*

She turned a corner too quickly, her foot slipping on gravel. She stumbled, nearly fell. Somewhere, someone shouted, but the voice didn’t break through. Her mind had become a tunnel, and at the end of it, all she could see was the door of Room 203—open, empty, cold. Letters on the floor. A phone case. A ghost of him.

And then a voice did cut through.

""Chizuru-san?!""

A hand grabbed her arm. She recoiled, chest heaving, and looked up through blurred vision.

Mini.

Concern twisted her features. ""What happened?! What's wrong?!""

Chizuru couldn’t form the words. Her hand opened slowly, revealing the envelope. Mini’s name on the front.

Her expression collapsed. ""No...""

""You were right,"" Chizuru rasped. ""He's gone. He’s really gone.""

Mini didn’t ask another question. She simply nodded, looping her arm around Chizuru’s shoulders. ""Let’s go home.""

Mini’s apartment smelled like nail polish, microwave curry, and laundry detergent. A familiar, chaotic mix. Once it had been comforting. Now, it mocked her with its warmth.

She sat on the tatami mat, knees drawn to her chest, the letter and phone case lying before her like artifacts at a wake.

*He really did it.*

*He’s really gone.*

The phone case was worse than the letter. It had been hers. A token of closeness, of subtle meaning. His keeping it had meant something. Now he’d returned it like a receipt.

Mini placed a cup of tea by her elbow and sat beside her. She didn’t push. Didn’t prod. Just waited.

Chizuru’s hand moved toward the cup, stopped, hovered in midair, and dropped to her lap. Jasmine curled into the air, soft and fragrant. But she couldn’t bring herself to sip it.

*Warmth doesn’t belong inside me today.*

She opened the letter. It was everything Kazuya would say. Grateful. Gentle. Kind. Too kind.

*Too final.*

She broke. Her voice was barely a whisper. ""So you knew.""

Mini swallowed. ""Not for sure. But he’d been... fading. That’s the only word I can use. Like he was becoming invisible, even while he stood in front of you. That’s why I asked you to check the apartment. I hoped I was wrong.""

Chizuru let the words fall into the air, heavy and unrelenting. ""It’s my fault. I waited too long. I thought I was protecting us. I thought... I thought he’d wait. That he’d understand.""

Mini was silent.

""But he didn’t,"" Chizuru whispered. ""He let go.""

And it broke her again.

She lunged for her phone.

*He couldn’t be far. He must still be in the city. He must—*

Dial tone. Disconnected.

LINE: User not found.

Instagram. Twitter. Gone.

Her hands started to shake.

*No. No no no no—*

She dialed Kibe.

""Mizuhara.""

He already knew.

""Where is he?! You knew—why didn’t you tell me?!""

A long, tired sigh. ""Because he begged us not to. Said it was his choice. Said he didn’t want to make a scene. Honestly, Mizuhara, what did you expect? You never gave him the clarity he deserves.""

Chizuru flinched. ""I didn’t mean to—""

""We’re tired too,"" Kibe muttered, the exhaustion sharp in his tone. ""We watched him destroy himself loving you. Maybe now... maybe he can breathe.""

Click.

She stared at the phone, stunned. *Even they blame me.*

She called Kuri.

""He made his choice, Ichinose-san,"" he said flatly. ""And frankly, he should've done it sooner. Watching him grovel, beg, wait... it was pathetic. He finally chose himself. Let him be.""

Click.

*They really are done with me.*

She had never felt more alone.

She dialed Nagomi.

""Chizuru-chan?""

""He’s gone, Nagomi-san. Room 203 is empty. He left us all letters. He left you one too.""

Silence. Then, a soft gasp.

""No... no, he told me it was a secret project. I believed him. I—""

Her voice cracked.

""Come over tomorrow,"" Nagomi said eventually. ""We’ll read it together.""

Chizuru hung up.

And, against her better judgment, she called Mami.

""Oh? He left? Huh. Did you finally push him too far?""

She didn’t wait to hear more. Click.

Last call.

""Sumi-chan... I need a friend.""

Twenty minutes later, Sumi was there. No questions. Just a hug. Just presence.

""If he’s meant for you,"" she whispered, ""he’ll come back.""

Miles away, Kazuya sat in a hotel bed, knees pulled to his chest.

He hadn’t eaten.

He hadn’t slept.

He stared at the last letter. Her letter.

Unsent.

*Coward.*

*Maybe someday.*

The city outside glowed, unbothered by his heartbreak.

Chizuru’s phone buzzed.

A LINE message. A name she wasn’t ready to see.

**Ruka:** Good evening, Chizuru. Can we meet at Excelsior Café at 11:00 AM tomorrow? It’s about Kazuya. He talked to me this afternoon. I want to explain.

Chizuru’s hand tightened around the phone.

*He talked to her.*

*Not to me. Not even a goodbye.*

*But her?*

A hot, nauseating wave of jealousy surged through her chest.

*Of course he talked to Ruka. She's easy. Safe. Obvious. I'm the one who needed time—but he couldn't wait. He gave up on me... but not on her?*

Her jaw clenched.

*He left me broken and vanished into the wind, and she gets an explanation? She gets his voice?*

She typed back: *Okay, Ruka-chan. See you.*

She showed Mini the screen.

Mini’s eyes darkened. ""It’s not just heartbreak now.""

""What is it?""

Mini met her gaze.

""It’s a reckoning.""

Chizuru didn’t argue. She lay back down, clutching the phone case to her chest.

And waited for the sun to rise.

# Chapter 12: A Room With No Echoes

The room in the business inn at Hamamatsucho was aggressively bland. Beige walls. A single stiff bed. A narrow desk with an outdated phone and a lamp that flickered if you looked at it wrong. Outside the window, tangled train lines ran in overlapping loops, stretching toward every corner of Tokyo and none at all. It wasn’t a place meant for living. It was a place meant for disappearing.

Kazuya sat on the edge of the bed, elbows resting on his knees, the plastic crinkle of a new SIM card packet in his hand. This was it. The final step.

*No turning back now.*

He exhaled, slow and controlled. Popped open the tray of his new burner phone—a plain, featureless slab of glass and metal he’d picked up anonymously. No biometric scan. No contact syncing. Just numbers. Just silence. He inserted the SIM card like it was a key into a lock he wasn't sure he wanted to open.

Before powering it on, he picked up his old phone. Still intact. Still warm from his hand. Still filled with memories.

One last time.

He connected it to his laptop, fingers moving with practiced muscle memory. Gallery. Favorites. The screen lit up, a stream of familiar faces smiling at him from better days. Kibe, mid-laugh, pointing a finger at Kuri while the latter blushed behind a mic at karaoke. Mini, half-out-of-frame, her mouth caught mid-word and her eyes bright with mischief. Sumi, quietly holding a slice of strawberry cake like it was a treasure, her blush almost glowing.

Then Ruka. Hugging his arm. Eyes closed, beaming. Back when he believed that maybe someone like him could be loved like that. Or maybe he just wanted to believe.

And then, her.

Chizuru. Candid shots. Smile barely held back. A strand of hair caught in the wind. That moment at the shrine. The accidental photo she didn’t know he took when she dozed off next to him on the train. She looked peaceful. Like she trusted him.

*Do you hate me now?*

He wasn’t sure. He wasn’t sure if he wanted the answer.

The last photo stopped him cold. It was from the movie wrap party. She was laughing. Not the rented kind. Not the composed, client-ready smile. This one was different. Bright. Unfiltered.

*Kaz... you got to see that. Once. Just once.*

A single tear slipped down the corner of his cheek. He didn't bother wiping it away.

He unplugged the phone. Powered it off. Removed the battery.

It was done.

Outside the window, a train rattled by. Inside, the silence pressed down like a second skin.

He turned back to the laptop. Pulled up his email. One unread message: University of the Ryukyus. His transfer paperwork had been received. Dorm confirmed. Orientation details enclosed.

The aquarium job had also replied. Interview scheduled for next week. Everything was falling into place. Logistically, at least.

Emotionally?

A mess. But a necessary one.

*This isn’t about forgetting her. Or escaping them. This is about me. For once, just me.*

The lie of control was intoxicating. Still, he clung to it.

He stood and walked to the small sink in the corner of the room. Ran the water until it turned cold. Splashed his face. Looked into the mirror.

The man staring back didn’t look heroic. Or even healed. He looked raw. Like a wound half-scabbed. But there was something else, too—something almost dangerous in the quiet set of his jaw. Purpose.

*You broke. You bled. You begged.*

*Now build.*

He sat again. Opened a blank document. Began to write.

Not a letter.

A list.

* Wake up early
* Take train to aquarium
* Learn to breathe underwater again
* Learn to be alone without loneliness
* Stop apologizing to ghosts

He stared at the fifth bullet point for a long time.

Then he typed a sixth.

* Maybe forgive yourself

In the drawer, the last remaining object from his old life sat hidden: her letter. Unopened. Untouched. He couldn’t bring himself to destroy it. But he wasn’t ready to read it, either.

Not yet.

*When I do... I want to be someone worthy of it.*

He closed the drawer.

The room remained bland. But inside, a quiet shift had taken root.

For the first time in a long while, Kazuya lay down. And he slept.

Not dreamlessly.

But without regret.

# Chapter 13: A Reckoning at Ikebukuro

Excelsior Café, Ikebukuro — 10:55 AM

The coffee in front of Chizuru had gone cold.

She hadn’t touched it. Couldn’t. It sat there, untouched and forgotten, like a metaphor for everything she’d let slip away. Her hands were folded tightly in her lap, clenched so hard her nails dug half-moons into her skin. She’d been early, of course. Twenty minutes early. She needed the control, the illusion of preparation. But no amount of mental rehearsals could silence the storm brewing in her chest.

*Why did he talk to her?*

*What did he say?*

*Why her and not me?*

A sick tension coiled in her stomach, jealousy twining with guilt until it became something unbearable. The café’s soft jazz and warm lighting were wasted on her. Everything felt too gentle, too civilized for what this meeting promised.

She spotted Ruka the moment she walked in.

Chizuru blinked. For a heartbeat, she didn’t recognize her.

The blue ribbon was gone.

Ruka’s hair was pinned back with a pearl clip, elegant and understated. Her blouse was cream silk, tucked into a navy A-line skirt that swayed softly with her every step. She looked like a woman ten years older — graceful, mature, poised.

*She’s not here to plead,* Chizuru realized, a chill creeping up her spine. *She’s here to win.*

Ruka’s eyes found hers. Calm. Steady. There was no smile. No greeting. Just a long, piercing stare as she approached the table.

Chizuru stood, throat tightening. ""Ruka-chan... Where is he? What did he tell you?""

Ruka stopped just short of the table. Her eyes shimmered — not with tears, but with something sharper.

Then:

**SLAP.**

The crack of skin against skin silenced the café. Chizuru’s head snapped sideways, her breath catching in her throat.

Before she could react —

**SLAP.**

The other cheek. Hot. Immediate. Blinding.

Gasps rippled through the café. Distant clatters of cups halted midair. No one moved.

Chizuru staggered back, stunned. Her hands trembled at her sides. Her ears rang. Her vision blurred.

""How dare you,"" Ruka hissed, voice taut with trembling rage. ""How dare you ask me where he is.""

Chizuru stared, eyes wide, mouth parting but no words forming.

""After everything he did for you —"" Ruka's voice cracked, but she pressed on, louder, harsher, angrier — ""After he bled for you, waited for you, built his entire life around *you* — and you stood there. You let him burn. You watched him shatter.""

Chizuru’s voice came out hoarse. ""I didn’t mean to —""

""Didn’t mean to? *Didn’t mean to?*"" Ruka laughed — a short, brittle sound. ""You didn’t *do* anything! You just waited! You watched him spiral and you *waited!* Is that love to you, Ichinose Chizuru? Waiting while someone drowns?"" Her voice dropped into a venomous whisper. ""You let him believe he was disposable.""

Chizuru’s breath hitched. ""You don’t know anything about us. You—""

""Don’t I?!"" Ruka slammed her palms onto the table. Dishes rattled. Chizuru flinched. ""You think I don’t know what it’s like to love someone who looks at you like you’re second place? I knew from the start I was fighting a losing battle. But at least I *fought.* At least I *tried.* What did you do? You ran. You hid behind your career, your contracts, your damn *image.*""

Chizuru's voice broke. ""You forced him. You used blackmail. You trapped him—""

""Because I *wanted him.* I was desperate and stupid, yes — but I never pretended otherwise. I loved him. Loudly. Wrongly. Completely. Can you say the same, Chizuru-san? Can you say you ever gave him your full heart? Even once?""

The silence that followed was deafening. Chizuru’s lips trembled, but no sound emerged. Her hands were shaking. She dropped into her seat.

Ruka exhaled, slow and ragged, then reached into her bag.

She pulled out a folded piece of paper. Set it gently on the table.

""He told me he had to leave,"" she said, voice now low, stripped of theatrics. ""He said he needed to become someone he could live with. Someone who didn’t beg for love.""

Chizuru blinked rapidly.

""I believe in destiny, and if we are meant to be, we will meet.""

Ruka stared at her for a long moment.

""So wait if you also do. Wait for him, if you want. But I won’t wait without doing anything. I’ll grow. I’ll rise. I’ll become the kind of woman he can’t ignore. And if we cross paths again... I won’t need to fight anymore, because I will be better than you.""

She turned. Walked out.

The café resumed its gentle murmur.

Chizuru sat there, cheeks burning, the letter on the table and a silence inside her louder than any scream.

Her fingers curled around the phone case in her pocket. The only thing left of him.

*He talked to her. Not to me.*

*He trusted her with his goodbye.*

*And I? I’m still waiting for a chance to speak.*

# Chapter 14: The Weight of the Empty Sky

The world was a blurry, muted hum.

Chizuru sat frozen in her chair, the warmth of the untouched coffee cup a stark contrast to the ice that had formed in her veins. Ruka was gone. The echoes of her parting words—\*""The next time he has to choose... he will choose me""—\*ricocheted through the empty chambers of Chizuru’s mind.

The cheerful clink of dishes and quiet jazz resumed, but everything sounded distorted now. Off-key. Wrong. The chatter of strangers felt barbed, like invisible fingers pointing at her. A laugh from the next table was too loud. Too knowing. She could feel them staring. They had seen the slaps. The shouting. The collapse.

She hadn’t even fought back.

*Did you ever fight for him like that?*

The question pulsed in her skull, unrelenting. Images flickered behind her eyes like a cruel highlight reel—

Mami, cornering Kazuya with venom-laced words. And Chizuru, standing silently beside him.

Umi, sneering as Kazuya wilted. And Chizuru, offering him only polite distance.

Ruka, loud and desperate and fearless. And Chizuru, always on the sidelines, always *managing.*

*You managed him like a client. Like a brand. Like a risk.*

And now he was gone.

She stood up, her movements jerky, robotic. A few bills fell onto the table to cover the coffee she never drank. She walked out of the café with the same practiced posture she used for red carpet events, but it wasn’t armor anymore. It was a costume. A hollow disguise.

Every step she took through the bright, noisy streets of Ikebukuro deepened the ache in her chest. The city, so full of life, had never felt more alien. Couples passed her by, laughing, brushing arms. They were oblivious to the grief radiating from her like static. Her reflection in store windows mocked her: pristine, composed, unreadable.

But inside, she was crumbling.

*He’s gone. He’s really gone. And she was right. I did this. I let him go.*

By the time she reached her apartment, her legs felt hollow. She stepped inside and closed the door behind her like it was the final act of a play. Everything was still. Too still. She slid down against the door, the cool wood at her back, and stared blankly ahead. No tears came. Her body had moved past tears. Now there was only the weight.

The weight of the things she never said.

The weight of the man she never stopped loving.

She clutched the phone case in her pocket—the last piece of him she still carried—and pressed it to her chest.

Her fingers trembled as she pulled out her phone and dialed the one person she had left.

""Chizuru-chan?"" Nagomi’s voice answered after the first ring, warm and grandmotherly, but touched with concern. ""Is everything alright?""

Chizuru swallowed. Her voice came out hoarse. ""Nagomi-san... I met with Ruka.""

A pause.

""Oh?""

""She... she doesn’t know where he is. He didn’t tell her either. But she told me... what he said. About leaving. About needing to change.""

Nagomi sighed. It was the kind of sigh that came from deep within the bones. ""Yes. He told us something similar. But I had hoped...""

Chizuru crossed to the window. The late afternoon sun filtered through the glass, too warm for the cold that gripped her. And then, somewhere in the distance, she heard it—the low hum of a plane, slicing through the sky.

A sudden, chilling certainty settled over her like frost.

""Nagomi-san,"" she whispered. ""Did he... Did he leave Tokyo?""

The silence on the other end was confirmation enough.

Chizuru closed her eyes. The floor seemed to sway beneath her feet.

""I see,"" she murmured, her voice breaking. ""I’m coming over. To your house. He left you a letter. And... and the ring. The ring he gave me. I need to give them back.""

Another pause. Then Nagomi, with the steadiness of someone who had lived through many kinds of heartbreak, said, ""Alright, Chizuru-chan. We’ll be waiting.""

When the call ended, Chizuru lowered the phone slowly and let it fall from her hand. She sank to her knees, curling over the phone case now pressed against her heart.

Kazuya was in the air. Leaving the city. Leaving the past. Leaving her.

And she was still here.

Still waiting to speak.

Still holding the words she should have said when he needed them most.

She had lost the war before she even realized it had begun.

# Chapter 15: The Family He Left Behind

The Kinoshita house had always carried a warmth to it—a lived-in comfort, cluttered in the way that only real homes are. But tonight, it felt different. As Chizuru stood at the front step, clutching a plain brown paper bag in her trembling hands, the air was thick, almost reverent. Inside the bag were three things: the letter Kazuya had left for his family, the letter for Mini, and the small velvet ring box he had once nervously placed in her palm.

She rang the doorbell.

The door opened with a soft creak. Kazuya’s father stood there, looking more tired than she had ever seen him. The usual stern lines of his face had softened with concern.

""Chizuru-chan,"" he said quietly. ""Come in.""

She stepped inside and immediately felt the weight of absence. The television was off. The kitchen silent. No scent of dinner. It was a house waiting for someone who wouldn’t return.

Nagomi sat at the dining table, her hands folded over a handkerchief. The bright colors she usually wore were gone. Even her favorite red lipstick had been replaced with a more muted tone. Yet, when she looked up at Chizuru, she smiled.

""Ah, Chizuru-chan,"" she said, her voice strained but warm. ""You must be hungry. Sit down. Please.""

Kazuya’s mother, Harumi, was already at the table, her expression unreadable. Her eyes were red-rimmed, as though she had cried until there were no tears left. She did not greet Chizuru at first, but her presence alone spoke volumes.

Chizuru took the seat offered to her, lowering the bag carefully onto the table. She looked around, and for a moment, her breath caught. The last time she had sat here, Kazuya had been next to her, fidgeting nervously while she tried to keep up appearances. Now, there was only a quiet void.

*This family... they took me in. They accepted me when they didn't have to. Even when they thought I was only pretending, they opened their hearts. And I... I let them believe there was a future. A future I was too afraid to fight for.*

She cleared her throat. ""He left these. The letter for you. And... the ring.""

She opened the bag and placed the velvet box and the envelope in front of Nagomi with slow, deliberate movements. Her hands were shaking.

Kazuya’s father remained silent but watched her with quiet empathy. Harumi finally spoke.

""You still have his eyes, you know,"" she said.

Chizuru blinked, startled. ""I... What do you mean?""

Harumi reached across the table, her fingers gently brushing the edge of the velvet box.

""I see him in you,"" she said. ""The way you hold your pain. The way you try not to let it show.""

Something cracked inside Chizuru.

She stood abruptly, her chair scraping against the wood floor, and bowed—deep and low, her hands clenched at her sides.

""I’m sorry,"" she said, her voice breaking. ""This is all my fault. I was afraid. I let him go. I didn't tell him how much he meant to me until it was too late. If I had just...""

She couldn’t finish. The words choked her.

Nagomi rose and crossed the room in slow, deliberate steps. She placed a hand gently on Chizuru’s shoulder and guided her upright.

""It’s not your fault,"" she said firmly. ""That boy... he's always been harder on himself than anyone else ever could be.""

Harumi joined them and, without a word, pulled Chizuru into a hug. Chizuru stiffened at first, then melted into it, the years of pent-up grief and gratitude collapsing all at once.

*I never had this. Not like this. I was always pretending to be strong. To be composed. But with them... I can break. And still be held.*

When they finally pulled apart, Nagomi opened the letter. Her voice wavered as she read, but she didn’t stop.

Kazuya's words were gentle, composed. He told them not to worry. That he had made this decision to find himself, to grow into someone they could truly be proud of. That he was thankful for everything they'd done. And that he loved them.

Chizuru listened with her hands folded in her lap, staring down at the table.

*He always tried to protect them. Even now, he’s still shielding them from the real reason he left. From the pain of what we became.*

When Nagomi finished reading, there was silence.

Then, Chizuru reached for the ring box. She opened it, revealing the simple, elegant ring inside. It gleamed under the soft light.

""He left this,"" she said. ""I think... I think it should stay with you.""

Nagomi looked down at it, then back at her. She pushed the box gently toward Chizuru.

""No,"" she said. ""You keep it. Not because he gave it to you. But because you still carry him. In here.""

She tapped her chest.

""You're family, Chizuru-chan. That doesn’t change just because he’s not here. We still believe in you. We still believe in *you two.*""

The words hit her like a warm tide. Unbearable in their kindness.

*Even after all this... they still want me in their lives. They still believe he might come back to me. How can I ever repay that kind of love?*

Harumi took her hand and smiled, tearfully.

""Stay here tonight,"" she said. ""Stay as long as you need. You're not alone.""

Chizuru could only nod. The tears came again, soft and silent, as she sat among the people who had once been strangers, but now felt more like home than any place she had ever known.

Why do I (27f) feel like my mom (42f) wants me to be single?

Yeah you read that right. Ill save you time doing the math. She gave birth to me at 15. So in a way we grew up together. We have always been close more like sisters or friends than mother and daughter.. 

However every time we fight its while im in a relationship.. about my relationship.. Every relationship i have ever been she says things ""He doesnt love you"" ""you dont seem happy"" ""you've changed"" ""you're not fun anymore"" ""hes controlling, you need to leave him"" manipulates me to the point that I ended up leaving my last long term relationship of 5 years.. then afterwards tells me that im messing up my life ect.. for my own mental health ive had to cut ties with her more than once.. it never lasts long though unfortunately.. I dont have much of a support system and in many ways my mom is my best and only friend.. 

When it comes to my relationships I try to tell her that im the one making decisions but she still blames it on whatever guy im with at the time.. it causes such a huge rift between me and my mom and me and my partner.. literally causes turmoil in my entire life every time she comes around..

Most recently we went on a family vacation. The plan was for my mom to fly in because she lives out of state, meet me and my sister and our families and drive from there. There was 10 of us total. Our original plan was to rent a coach bus of sorts but it ended up being too expensive so we decided on taking mine and my sisters sedans.. however I was concerned that with 10 people, a 4 day trip and 10+ bags abd 2 coolers (so we didn't have to eat out every meal) that we wouldn't be able to fit all of our belongings in just 2 standard sedans.. so I brought up taking my boyfriends truck instead. His truck was old and not the most reliable thing but day of our trip the driver seat motor broke in my car.. my driver seat no longer moved at all  was stuck in the very upmost position. We ALL agreed that taking my sisters car and my boyfriends truck was our best option. We had an 8hr drive to get to our location. We got there just fine with no problems. Fast forward to the day we leave and not even an hour out his truck breaks down completely. Engine seizes in the middle of the black hills.. everyone in my sisters car took off and went home leaving me, my boyfriend, my 2 kids and my kid sister (8) stranded.. we got a hotel for the night and ended up having to buy a new truck the following day to get home.. his credit is trash and he has never had a loan so we sat in the dealership for over 8hrs trying to make something work.. i ended up having to cosign.. we finally make it home and i pick her up from my sisters.. during that 45 minute drive she goes on telling me that my boyfriend ruined our entire vacation by deciding to take the truck and that she has lost all respect for him because he put all of our lives in parallel.. that he is destroying my life by putting me in massive amounts of debt and wrecking my credit.. and that he doesn't let me make any decisions.. taking his truck was my decision. The driver seat being stuck where it was in my vehicle did not make me feel safe or comfortable taking it and there wasn't time to have it repaired.. my boyfriend treats me like a queen. I say jump he says how high. He does everything I ask for and more..for example. last year my cousin got married and because my relationship was fairly new at that point I wasn't given a plus one and it was an 18+ wedding.. he stayed back home and watched everyone's kids so we could all go to this wedding.. the following morning before anyone woke up he cleaned the puke all over the inside and outside of my car from my sister (who had just turned 21 the month before..) he got everyone coffee and made everyone breakfast. Between children and adults I had over 20 people staying in my 3bedroom house for that wedding.. for my dads wedding just a couple weeks ago my boyfriend was not in the wedding at all and he completely built an isle for the father of the bride who is handicapped THE MORNING OF THE WEDDING. he was sewing on all the groomsmen buttons (yes my man can sew) he was also taking care of and getting my 2 kids ready because i was in the wedding.. then he was driving a golf cart back and forth from the parking lot to the venue (it was quite a distance) all night long.. then he was the very first person awake for take down the next day.. took down the isle, all the decorations, cleaned up and loaded 5 trailers single handedly.. he is the most selfless, caring, considerate person I have ever met.. the rest of my family absolutely loves him.. 
I don't know what her problem is but this whole thing has put me in mental and emotional distress.. ",3,1752160356.0,motherinlawsfromhell,1,1.0,False

1lwf4xa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDad/comments/1lwf4xa/men_are_odd_a_very_long_rant/,Men are odd. A very long rant.,"A couple of months ago, I made a post asking for advice on how to deal situations with a guy I was dating. Today im here to tell you we are no longer in a relationship after 3 years.
  Somehow it got to the point of him going days without speaking to me. Not a call,text, nothing not even a simple ""hey, how are you"". I get fed up, so I called him out about it. His literal response was ""I told you I didnt want to date so I dont know why you're blowing up my phone, on top of that im not in the mood to socialize so im not gonna text you"" 
   Now this bothered me for many reasons because:
1: He quite literally took me on a date and asked me to be his girlfriend at a fine dining restaurant. I still have the dried rose petals in a jar on my coffee table.
2. I do not blow up his phone, I texted him 4x that week and called him twice. He never responded to the calls or text. So I stopped trying.
3.Last month I went on a work trip down to South Texas and everyday on a daily basis he would call/text to check on me. He even requested to have my location while I was away. He went on a work trip to East Texas for about 3 weeks and VOLUNTARILY called/texted every day for check ins and shared his location with me. 
4. Since when was checking in with your significant other considered socializing??? 
   Although my feelings are extremely hurt and Im heartbroken, I dont try to argue or convince him to stay. Because you know obviously I need to have some self respect.Eventually I get so overwhelmed and confused I just stop responding to his calls/text.  Some days go by and I ask to come get some things i left at his house, he didnt respond til the next day saying i can come get my things the following day. We agreed I would get my clothes from his house at 1pm, the day comes and while im already driving to him, he calls and tells me something came up with his mom and he wont be able to meet me. I get annoyed again obvi, DFW traffic is nothing to play with especially during lunch rush hour and especially considering we live on opposite sides of town.  
   Instead of arguing I ask him when he'll be available again but he's going to have to come to me because I was getting a migraine and could barely see(I suffer from chronic migraines with aura.) Dads, this man doesnt show up to my house until 9pm and he has all of my belongings balled up and shoved in 4 Aldi bags. Mind you all of my clothes were neatly folded and put away at his house, while im staring at my things in utter disbelief he starts yapping about how he no longer wants to be in a relationship because he has ""mommy and trust issues"" and how he needs to focus on his new Tech job and what not. 
   Now my annoyance turns into irritation because what the hell is he even talking about at this point? Those ""issues"" have never been a problem. Anyways after that he tells me although he doesn't wanna be in a committed relationship but he would still like for us to go out together and to have sex. I get triggered and asks him to clarify, because what do you mean you dont wanna be my boyfriend but you still want to act like said boyfriend. He tells me and I quote; "" I dont know how to clarify that but I do know the next time we have sex its gonna be for impregnating purposes, because I do want you to be the mother of my children"" 
*record scratch Freeze frame* 
What??? Excuse me??? Hello? Let me get this straight *checks notes* he doesn't want to be in a committed relationship but he does want to be heavily committed to raising a child with me for the rest of our lives? The irritation now turns to pure disrespect, because theres no way in hot hell you think you're gonna treat me like this and say those words to me and think Im still going to want to be with you. Not to mention I cant count the amount of times he has told me about what it was like being raised by a single mother, but somehow he wants to create that same scenario.

I admit I am a little neurotic so hearing others’ experiences often assuages me. I also usually travel knowing that people much less aware have successfully completed the trip!

I am a US passport holder so that certainly impacted my experience!

I flew one way from a Gulf country to JFK on Etihad with a short 1 hour 45 mins layover in Abu Dhabi. 

After getting my boarding pass, the gate agent let me know no soft luggage was allowed. I had to cardboard it up (3 pieces) at the station next door for $24 total.

My outbound flight left late and arrived about 45 mins late as well. 

I rushed off the plane and confirmed by AirTag that my bags in fact made it to AUH.

I walked fastly and set a timer: 17 mins from deplaning to the preclearance line where Etihad agents were front loading JFK passengers. There was security, in between but very efficient.

Line was long, so long as you were in line, no one seemed to be worried.

I have a U.S. passport and the MCP app (highly recommended!) and went to an express line. I went to a small lounge while my checked bags were inspected, took all of 7 minutes and again, it didn’t seem like anyone was held up.

I got a coffee after preclearance and boarding was slow— doors were not shut 30 mins before like I’d expect in the U.S. 

Touched down at JFK— AirTags said my bags made it, and took a cab home!

Happy to answer any questions but I understand a lot of people’s anxieties may stem from passport control.

She seemed into me and we continued chatting and arranged a 2nd date. A day before the 2nd date she messaged saying she cant make it because she got gifted a ticket to a festival, I thought fair enough and suggested another date.

She said she'd get back to me, and after a few days of chatting I asked if she had an idea when she was free. She has a slightly inconvinient work schedule which means she sometimes works quite late and 1 day each weekend. She was working late that week so our schedules didnt fit. I tried suggesting a day the week after and again she said she'd let me know later in the week. We continued chatting like normal but I had to ask her again if she new when she was free. Again it took her a few days to answer the question even though we continued chatting. After a few days I just checked in to see if she was still interested, she confirmed she was still interested and suggested a Friday and I agreed.

Either the day before or the Friday morning she sent a message saying she was feeling really anxious about it and suggested another day. I thought, sure I get that and suggeted some days when I was free, again she said she'd get back to me. After a few days, I suggested a coffee and walk with her dog in a local park but because it was usually her schedule that was tricky suggested that she pick the day. She said that sounds nice but then never suggested a day, for a few days we continued chatting then I left the ball in her court.

  
After 5 days of not hearing anything I umed and ahhed about just saying I dont think this is working out or a message just touching base. I decided to touch base and she replied the same day and said some stuff was going on at work and with her family but she was still interested. Fair enough life happens but she didnt reply to 2 of my messages for 5 days or let me know she was busy but still there.

  
I think after having 2 dates rescheduled and her not suggesting when she was free I kind of wrote the whole thing off in my head. And the message to touch base was just me getting closure as I didnt expect a reply.

Through therapy I've realised that I want someone who actually reciprocates my effort and its not just me suggesting everything. It seems like that is the bare minimum with people. I know her work and life schedule probably wont get any better and I don't want to have to keep going through the faf of having to ask if she knows when she is free.

Its 1 date, I should probably just end things where they are, right.

I just need to voice a situation im currently in. I dont see my therapist until next week.

1lwf03g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lwf03g,Hygge + wellness,"How I Transformed My Cramped NYC Apartment Using Danish ""Hygge"" - And Why It Actually Works.

Discovered this Danish concept called hygge, tried it in my 400 sq ft apartment, and somehow my mental health improved dramatically. Here's what actually worked (and what didn't).

Background: Why I Even Tried This.

Living in a major US city is expensive AF and honestly pretty soul-crushing sometimes. I was working 50+ hours a week, doom-scrolling until 2 AM, and my ""self-care"" routine consisted of ordering DoorDash and binge-watching Netflix. Sound familiar?

Then I stumbled across this Danish concept called hygge (pronounced ""hoo-gah"") - basically the art of being cozy and finding joy in simple stuff. Denmark consistently ranks as one of the happiest countries, so I figured... why not try their approach?

What I Actually Did (No BS Version)

The Lighting Game-Changer

Ditched the harsh overhead LED for warm table lamps and candles. This sounds stupid but it literally changed everything. My apartment went from feeling like a corporate office to actually feeling like home. Cost: ~$50 at Target.

Created a ""Hygge Corner""

Took the corner by my window, added a comfortable chair, soft blanket, and small side table. This became my sacred space for morning coffee, reading, or just sitting without my phone. Game changer for my anxiety.

Digital Detox (Sort Of)

Started putting my phone in another room during meals and for an hour before bed. Not gonna lie, this was hard at first, but my sleep improved significantly. Also started actually tasting my food instead of mindlessly eating while scrolling.

Seasonal Awareness

Started shopping at farmers markets (when budget allowed) and decorating with seasonal stuff. Fall meant pumpkins and warm spices, winter meant cozy blankets and hot chocolate. Sounds basic but it helped me feel more connected to... life, I guess?

What Actually Worked vs. What Didn't
What Worked:

Candles everywhere (seriously, game changer)
Cooking simple, comforting meals instead of ordering out
Having friends over for low-key hang sessions instead of expensive bar nights
Reading physical books instead of scrolling
Taking baths with essential oils (yes, I'm that person now)

What Didn't Work:

Trying to be ""hygge"" 24/7 (impossible and exhausting)
Expensive Danish furniture (broke college student problems)
Forcing myself to like herbal tea (still a coffee person)

The Mental Health Impact (Real Talk)
After about 3 months of consistently doing this stuff:

-Sleep quality improved dramatically
-Anxiety decreased significantly
-Stopped feeling FOMO about social media
-Actually enjoyed spending time alone
-Felt more grateful for small things

I'm not saying this is a cure-all, but it definitely helped me feel more... stable? Content? It's hard to explain, but I stopped feeling like I was constantly chasing the next thing to make me happy.

Practical Tips for Fellow Americans

Start Small: Don't try to overhaul your entire life. Pick one thing (I recommend the lighting change).

Budget-Friendly: You don't need expensive Danish furniture. Target, thrift stores, and even Dollar Tree candles work fine.

Adapt to Your Space: Studio apartment? Your bed can be your hygge corner. Shared living situation? Focus on your personal space.

Don't Instagram It: This isn't about creating the perfect aesthetic for social media. It's about actually feeling good in your space.

The Science Behind It (For the Skeptics)

Looked into this more and turns out there's actual research backing up why this works:

-Warm lighting reduces cortisol (stress hormone)
-Mindful eating improves digestion and satisfaction
-Social connection is literally essential for mental health
-Seasonal awareness helps regulate circadian rhythms

Bottom Line

Is hygge going to solve all your problems? Obviously not. But in a culture that's constantly telling us to do more, buy more, achieve more, there's something genuinely refreshing about a philosophy that says ""maybe just be comfortable and present.""

Plus, it's way cheaper than therapy (though therapy is great too, no shade).

the sofa and a dark wood rectangular coffee table are the only living room items i'm bringing with me. my new apartment was built in the 1930s and has these beautiful geometic patterns inlaid in the wood floor and pointed gothic archways between rooms. the layout is also quite strange for the living room, as it's broken up by the archways leading to other rooms, so i've attached an image of the floorplan. my sofa has a very busy, drab, vintage pattern. i love the shape and comfort of it, but i'm having issues styling around it. i'd like to use more jewel tones and colors such as yellow, magenta, and teal. but with my sofa already having red, blue, beige, and green in it, i feel stuck with that color scheme.

Tried it recently and here’s my honest breakdown 👇

https://preview.redd.it/mu9f31y1sgbf1.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=70a5387818af50956d46aad254a570ae136b007c

# 🌿 Opening: Clean Sheets and Sunshine

Right off the top, you’re greeted with **lavender**, **bergamot**, **lemon**, and a whisper of **rose**. It’s fresh but in a soft, almost powdery way—not sharp or acidic. Picture clean white linen drying in the breeze, with the faint scent of a summer garden nearby.

This intro feels breezy and optimistic—like the kind of scent you’d wear on a sunny brunch date or to a breezy balcony morning coffee.

# 💐 The Heart: Soft Florals with a Sweet Twist

Once the citrus fades, the floral heart steps in with:

* **Blackcurrant** (a little fruity zing),
* **Orris** (powdery and elegant),
* **Jasmine** and **Lily of the Valley** (delicate, classic florals).

It’s a beautifully done floral heart—not overly sweet, not too green. Just smooth, airy, and a touch romantic. The **orris**gives it that velvety softness that makes it feel *expensive*.

# 🪵 The Dry-Down: Soft Woods and Amber Glow

The base is simple but satisfying: **sandalwood** and **amber**. These notes bring warmth and longevity without stealing the spotlight.

It ends like a gentle embrace—warm, slightly creamy, and mellow. No heavy oud or punchy vanilla—just smooth, polished woodiness that keeps things grounded.

# 🧴 Packaging Vibes

Yes, the scent is great—but **the bottle? Gorgeous.**  
Sleek, modern, and squared off in all the right ways. It has that minimalist luxury aesthetic and feels heavy in the hand (over 500g with packaging). Definitely feels like more than what it costs.

100ml of classy juice that looks amazing on the shelf and even better on your dresser.

# ⏱️ Longevity & Sillage

* **Longevity**: A solid 6+ hours on skin, longer on clothes.
* **Projection**: Moderate—enough for people to notice, but never too much.
* **Sillage**: Airy and elegant. You’ll get whiffs throughout the day.

Unisex, but I’d say it leans just a bit feminine due to the florals. That said, anyone confident can pull this off.

# 👥 Who’s It For?

* Fans of **light florals** that don’t smell dated or synthetic
* People who love a **versatile scent** for daily wear or special occasions
* Anyone looking for a **budget-friendly fragrance** that punches way above its price

# 🎯 Final Thoughts

[L’Aventure Blanche](https://alharamainperfume.online/products/al-haramain-laventure-blanche-spray-100ml?variant=43669582807097) is a crowd-pleaser in a polished bottle. Clean, floral, smooth, and beautifully balanced—without ever feeling basic. It’s perfect for spring and summer, though I could see this working on cozy autumn days too.

It’s romantic, but not overly sweet. Classy, but not cold. If you’re into the **YSL Libre** / **Chanel Chance Eau Tendre** kind of vibe—but want something more unique and affordable—this might just be your next gem.",1,1752159693.0,Buyarabianperfumes,0,1.0,False

A few things before I get into the ranking 
1. No rift Pokémon because they’re too hard to scale accurately (2 exceptions)

2. Characters like Coffee Gregus and Geara’s Giratina are also excluded since they’re too weird and barely even count as characters

3. This ranking is based on three main criteria: lore/canon strength (being an interceptor, archetype, .exe file, etc.), Pokémon battling (team comp and skill), and who they’ve beaten/been beaten by and when. 

Again this is my opinion so if you don’t agree or think I forgot somebody please feel free to tell me as I’m always open to criticism and feedback.

Now into the actual ranking:

#0
Variya/karma.ai:

No shit

#1
Renegade MC:

This shouldn’t require much explanation, the renegade mc has shown time and again that they don’t fuck around. Their best feats include: defeating the master of nightmares, defeating Karma Beast Talon and soloing the space hags. These are by far the best feats of any character we’ve seen and paired with being an interceptor and having a power adjacent to the archetype and it’s pretty hard to argue against this placement.

#2
Vitus “Indriad” Theolia

Despite not having any real on-screen feats I couldn’t justify putting Vitus any lower than second. Vitus easily has some of the most impressive feats including: causing storm-9, defeating archetype awakened Erin (and likely marianette) doing so seemingly with ease, defeating the guardians of Aevium - Vivian (heavily implied), creating the voidal chasm and puppeteering Geara and Angie for most of the game.

#3
Nymiera

Nymiera is in the same boat as Vitus when it comes to screen time and feats. We can assume that she’s at the very least even in strength and more than likely above nim but even with her lack of feats being Vitus’ counterpart alone is enough to get her placed this high. (Interchangeable with 4th place)

#4
Paragon mc

Paragon MC largely has the same feats as Renegade MC but on a smaller scale. The main differences are that Paragon MC hasn’t showcased the Eon spell yet and that they used the red chain to help take down the space hags (Melia was also there but didn’t have much impact on the fight).

#5
Puppet master 

Fortunately for me, the puppet masters' scaling is pretty much told out right to us. According to Kieran and Clear (who have no reason to lie since it was only the two of them in the conversation) state that in the master of nightmares form the puppet master has surpassed Madame X in terms of power. Pair that with the puppet master only being defeated by a full power MC (including Adrest’s power) they slot very nicely into 5th place

#6
Madame X

Madame X like a lot of characters so far doesn’t have a lot of feats. She has an yveltal which implies some sort of connection to vitus (possibly having defeated him at some point although I don’t see that being the case for a number of reasons), has a time diamond, created Kieran and clear, clearly has a significant amount of knowledge likely expanding beyond the majority of characters. Kieran and Clear's statement keeps her from cracking the top 5 and she’s interchangeable with 7th for me although I have her edging it out.

#7
Crescent

Crescent is a pick I think I could get some pushback for as a lot of you guys seem to forget what Crescent has done. So far she’s: gone head to head with a post puppet master fight mc, defeated Kieran and clear in a 2v1, stalemated the space hags 2v1 and is an interceptor. It’s worth mentioning Clear does kill Crescent however I don’t think that says much about her placement since Clear had to distract her to even get the opportunity to go for the kill shot. 

#8/9
Spacea & Tiempa

I’m choosing to lump the space hags together here since there isn’t anything separating the two although if I had to pick one of the other I’d say tiempa>spacea based on the renegade fight. The two are former interceptors that have “ascended” although it isn’t clear what that entails yet and it may never be clear since they’re dead now. Despite their ascended interceptor status, I can’t justify them over any of the top 7 since all of them have feats/statements that directly place them above each of the space hags.

#10 
Celine

Our first true featless character Celine rounds out the top 10 for the sole reason that she's stated to have stalemated Madame X before proceeding to be encased in a crystal for the whole story. Her fight with Madame X and status as champion are enough to scrape her into the top 10 however you could definitely make arguments that other characters deserve this spot.

Now that the top 10 is finish’s I’m going to shorten my explanations a lot because this post is already ridiculously long.

#11 
Clear: edges out Kieran because of her illusions

#12 
Kieran: seemingly smarter than his counterpart clear but loses out because he has no abilities as far as we know

#13 
Valencia: an interceptor but featless so I couldn’t place them any higher, at least stronger than Dylan.

#14 
Nim: literally storm-9/Nymiera but hasn’t showcased any abilities of those two in her current form.

#15 
Karma Beast Talon: created to take down renegade mc but can’t really rank it since its only match up is against the strongest character, can’t see it losing to anybody lower than it though.

#16 
Alexandra: the second highest ranking member of the Pokémon league behind the person who stalemated Madame X, can’t see her beating anyone higher except KB Talon or Nim.

#17 
Angie: a guardian of Aevium controlled and potentially buffed by Vitus Theolia, likely stronger than all the other guardians

#18/19/20 
Anju, Hazuki, Vivian: core powers + one of the regis, nothing to indicate who’s stronger than who.

Honourable mentions:

The elite 8 who took up all the spots below this.
Damien who is one spot below the elite 8
M2, Melia, Aelita and Ren who take up spots 28-31 respectively in my full ranking.

If anyone managed to finish this post please tell me any criticism you might have had and I appreciate you for reading this since I enjoyed making it a lot. Originally I planned on doing the top 50 but that’s a lot of characters and writing out the top 20 already took me over an hour so maybe I’ll finish it another time.

A visual standout in my kitchen, the stainless steel and modern curves immediately grab attention. The coffee maker’s compact size, at 8.7"" deep, 9.7"" wide, and 16.3"" high, fits snugly under most kitchen cabinets, which was a small but appreciated relief—one less appliance taking up counter space! The suspended filter basket and stainless-steel accents speak to the thought put into its aesthetic, mixing functionality with a contemporary look. My clumsy hands also appreciate the reusable filter; it feels like a plus for environmental-conscious folks who are tired of buying paper filters.

**Programmable Convenience that Works**

This machine’s programmable feature makes mornings less chaotic. Setting the brew start time via the digital clock was simple. I could tell the interface was thoughtfully designed, with button-based controls that didn’t require an engineering degree to decipher. Waking up to freshly brewed coffee was a joy—although I still managed to spill some while fumbling for the cup in my half-asleep state. It’s worth noting the auto-warmer plate, which activates during brewing and shuts off after two hours, ensures the coffee stays hot if you’re distracted by morning chaos (or emails).

**Performance and Flavor Extraction**

The multi-stream spray head performs impressively well, evenly showering hot water over coffee grounds for robust flavor extraction. I genuinely noticed a difference in my coffee’s taste—it somehow resembled the quality you’d expect from a café! Brew speed is noteworthy: whether it’s a quick 20-ounce fill for a travel mug in six minutes or a full 10-cup carafe brewed in about 10 minutes, it’s great for people like me who are perpetually running late. Whether making espresso or lighter coffee, the results spoke to the effort BUNN has put in.

**Positives**

- Ease of programming for a hassle-free morning routine.  
- Durable stainless-steel construction ensures longevity.  
- Impressive flavor extraction replicates café-quality coffee.  
- Dual brewing options: mug-friendly or a full carafe for entertaining.  

**Negatives**

- The auto shut-off feature is great, though the 2-hour limit might not suit slower drinkers.  
- At 8.5 pounds, moving it for cleaning isn't a breeze.  
- Limitations for users at high altitudes (above 5,500 feet).  

**Competitors**

Among similar coffee makers, the BUNN Heat N Brew faces stiff competition. For comparison, take the Cuisinart DCC-3200, which offers a similar programmable experience but includes strength control for the coffee, a useful touch for those wanting more precision. The Keurig K-Café, though different in operation, provides versatility with its K-Cups and minimal cleanup hassle. Where BUNN outshines these rivals is its focus on core brewing quality and durability. Still, Keurig’s single-serve brewing feels better tailored for smaller households or solo coffee drinkers. 

One weakness compared to competitors is the absence of a brew-strength setting, a common feature in Cuisinart machines. However, BUNN’s consistency in flavor extraction through its multi-stream spray head compensates for this omission.

**Price Worthiness**

When weighing its features against its price, this coffee maker offers significant value for its performance and build. Comparable models often cut corners on durability or function, yet here, the BUNN Heat N Brew coffee maker feels purpose-built to last with its three-year warranty—a rarity among consumer appliances these days. Whether it’s worth your investment depends on priorities: if you’re seeking standout taste and timeless design without unnecessary gimmicks, it's a smart pick. Still, for those expecting every possible feature, there are machines that cater to such needs in the same range.

and in like 30 seconds it generates a whole presentation. designs, animations, everything.

But while equities surged, serious macro risks are developing under the surface.

President Trump announced new tariffs: 

50% on copper imports starting Aug 1

20–30% on seven other countries

50% on *all* Brazilian imports a move explicitly framed as political retaliation, not trade-related.

This matters: Brazil is the U.S.'s largest coffee supplier. Expect prices to rise and broader trade flows to feel the shock in coming months.

Meanwhile, investor sentiment has reached *extreme greed* levels. Many are ignoring the macro risk buildup, chasing short-term gains driven by FOMO. We've seen this movie before.

Fed minutes from June show clear internal disagreement. Some are open to cuts as early as July; others want to wait until 2025. My take: Powell will follow the market’s lead and deliver a cut in September not just because of inflation trends, but because growth is clearly weakening under the surface, especially with tariff headwinds incoming.

 I'm cautious here. Many indexes are now overbought, and lower-quality small caps are getting dragged into the rally a classic late cycle sign. It's time to trim risk, not chase momentum.

We have actually never done a lunch, dinner, even a cup of coffee in the almost 20 years I’ve been with her son.

It’s actually laughable now. And as life has gotten busier, and I just don’t have time to put up with her BS and acquiesce to all of her demands, I’ve just… stopped participating. 

I let her communicate through her son, who is extremely busy and never gets back to her, because he has his own life and own daily demands.  And I’ve gone very gray rock and go with the flow whenever she’s around.

She just spent the night at our house because it’s too tough for her to drive up and back in one day. I think I said maybe 20 words to her. And she was up bright and early and out the door. As she was leaving, she made the comment that she always wishes she had more time to talk to me because she never has enough time.

I politely smiled and said “you have to make the time “. And that was it.  

I’m proud of myself for saying what I thought, in a non-confrontational way. I have no idea if she got my point, but this is a pattern I’ve seen over the years where she will make time for everyone else except for me, but then lament that there’s never enough time. 

What’s sad is we could’ve had a great relationship, I was really looking forward to being part of the family, but she’s always treated me as “other “.  And now that I’ve finally grown a spine, and don’t let her push me around anymore, she’s realizing that maybe it would have been good to have me on her side!

1lwenrj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1lwenrj/could_the_hario_v60_coffee_dripper_review_change/,Could the Hario V60 Coffee Dripper Review Change Your Pour Over Experience Forever?,"The HARIO VDR-02-T and its conical design caught my eye as a must-try addition to my coffee-making arsenal. Having experimented with various brewing devices over the years, I was genuinely intrigued by claims of deeper flavor extraction and its award-winning reputation. Over the last couple of weeks, this coffee dripper became my go-to companion for morning routines and weekend experiments.

**Design and Build**  
The craftsmanship of this coffee dripper is worth noting. With a clear, AS resin body and polypropylene accents, it feels incredibly lightweight at just three ounces but doesn’t feel cheap or fragile. I found the material surprisingly sturdy—dishwasher safe and resistant to boiling water, making it practical for clumsy mornings (yes, I’ve almost dropped it twice). Its transparency, coupled with a beautiful matte finish, adds to its aesthetic appeal, particularly when paired with a glass carafe. The ergonomic handle is a game-changer, especially when serving multiple cups. I’ve tested it to its stated 1–4 cup capacity, and it handles batches effortlessly.

**Ease of Use**  
Being a manually operated coffee maker, this dripper is straightforward yet rewarding. I’ve used other pour-overs in the past that require a steep learning curve, but this one simplifies the process. With the reusable conical filter, all I needed was some freshly ground coffee, hot water, and about five minutes of patience. It has an intuitive operation mode that gave me full control over my brewing process—ideal for coffee enthusiasts who love experimenting with grind sizes and water ratios. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned barista, this product caters to multiple skill levels.

**Strengths**  
- Lightweight and portable, perfect for small apartments or travel.  
- Transparent body lets you monitor the brewing process and adjust accordingly.  
- Impressive flavor extraction, delivering robust and aromatic coffee every single time.  

[Find the best price for HARIO VDR-02-T on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0bwhkpclj/)

**Flavor Extraction and Performance**  
The standout feature for me in this dripper was how efficiently it extracts the full profile of the beans. The unique V-shaped cone allows water to filter through coffee grounds in a way that enhances richer and deeper flavors. Trying my favorite Ethiopian medium roast was a delight—I could taste hints of the floral notes that other brewers often muffled. Brewing an espresso roast delivered equally impressive results; layered, full-bodied, and smooth. The design is no marketing gimmick—it delivers exactly as promised.

**Highlighted Features**  
- Suitable for brewing 1 to 4 servings; each cup measures approximately 4.2 fl oz.  
- Winner of the 2007 Good Design Award, indicating its premium quality standard.  
- Dishwasher safe for hassle-free cleaning.  
- Works efficiently with its reusable filter, cutting down waste and saving costs.

**Pitfalls**  
Despite my admiration for this product, several areas feel underwhelming.  
- The cone depth means it needs specific paper filters, which might be inconvenient to source regularly.  
- If you’re brewing over a larger mug, slight drips can sometimes occur near the edges.  
- Manual brewing means time and technique are critical; there's no automation here for rushed mornings.

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this dripper to others like the Chemex or Kalita Wave, several advantages stood out. For one, its portability trumps the heavier glass Chemex. The Chemex delivers more nuanced brews on larger volumes, but its hefty design lacks the travel-friendly aspect of the VDR-02-T. On the other hand, the Kalita Wave provides a comparable user-friendly experience; however, it’s decidedly more expensive. Moreover, the Kalita requires precision in water pouring, whereas this HARIO dripper is far more forgiving. If control and richness of flavor are at the forefront of your coffee goals, this dripper holds its own impressively against market rivals. Its only perceived disadvantage is a smaller serving size compared to some competitors’ family-sized options.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
This dripper scores high on cost-effectiveness. I don’t want to overstate this, but where else can you find a coffee maker under such a reasonable price capable of enhancing flavor like a delicate art form? Similar products with metal or ceramic designs often drive up the cost without adding significant value. Considering its durable plastic material and how easy it is to clean, the financial value it provides becomes a no-brainer. Even taking into account the occasional replacement of paper filters, it’s an affordable option for both coffee beginners and aficionados.

I think it's easier to have a set of commandments that I follow so that I don't have to think through a decision every single time some cashier flips a payment screen around and says ""it's going to ask you a question.""

* Never tip before a service is performed.
* Only tip if you are giving me (or my personal group) dedicated attention for a significant portion of your workday (i.e. more than 5 minutes)
   * This includes table service, haircuts, and I would assume other services I don't make use of like manicure etc.
   * This excludes quick service restaurants, food trucks, etc.
   * This excludes random stuff like the guy narrating a sightseeing boat tour
* If you are adding a charge above what is printed on the menu, that's your tip, sorry.
   * More likely I just won't go to this restaurant.
* Never tip above 15% unless you are my literal niece or nephew. Bad service goes down from there.

I do break these rules for local businesses that I like a lot and give consistent good service. So yes I will tip the barista a buck at my local coffee place, but never Starbucks.

This essentially resets tipping to what it used to be 20 years ago, before everyone and their dog started holding their hand out at every possible contact point.

I agree that the end goal is a no-tip culture in the US just like everywhere else, but I'd rather just not go out to eat, than try to change things by not tipping at all. To each his own.",18,1752158703.0,EndTipping,14,0.71,False

Last week, I asked for your advice about the reliability of the Oxford to Paddington morning train, as I had an important meeting today. Thanks so much for your helpful responses and recommendations--they really made the decision-making process easier.

I ended up taking the 6:31 am train this morning, and everything went smoothly. I got to my destination with nearly an hour to spare!

Honestly, I wish I could thank you all with chocolate and coffee. But for now, please accept my sincere thanks-- I truly appreciated the support!",41,1752158659.0,oxford,3,0.99,False
1lweiw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1lweiw6/are_lg_overtherange_microwaves_worth_it_a_look_at/,Are LG Over-the-Range Microwaves Worth It? A Look at the MVEL2125F,"Using the LG MVEL2125F for a few weeks in my kitchen has been quite the experience. This over-the-range microwave combines sleek aesthetics with modern technology, and I’ve had the opportunity to test its features rigorously. From reheating leftovers to trying out the auto defrost function for frozen meals, this appliance has had its moments of brilliance. However, like everything, it also has areas where it didn’t quite meet all expectations.

**Design and Aesthetics**

One of the first things that struck me about this microwave was its appearance. The PrintProof stainless steel finish looks stunning and has been great at resisting smudges, which, trust me, is a lifesaver in a household with kids. The WideView window is another nice touch, offering a clear look at what’s cooking without having to open the door constantly. Everything about the design feels premium, right down to the smooth glass touch panel on the right-hand side. Unlike some microwaves I’ve owned in the past, the LG MVEL2125F genuinely adds a sophisticated vibe to the kitchen.

**Cooking Performance**

With 1050 watts of power, this microwave doesn’t mess around. The ten power levels allow for fine-tuned control, whether you’re heating up coffee or cooking a larger lasagna dish. The Sensor Cook feature has become my go-to for reheating meals. It’s surprisingly accurate, adjusting its settings based on the humidity levels of the food to prevent overcooking or undercooking. I must say, having my leftovers come out perfectly warmed without any hotspots is a small victory worth celebrating. 

**Check [LG MVEL2125F price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b0bfjn126r/)**  

**Ventilation and Noise**

The ExtendaVent 2.0 feature genuinely caught my attention. It extends further than regular over-the-range microwaves, covering more of the stovetop area. I put it to the test while stir-frying (which always gets smoky), and it worked impressively well. I noticed a significant reduction in smoke and lingering smells in the kitchen. Ventilation has been one of my primary concerns with over-the-range models, but LG seems to have invested effort here. Noise, however, could be another story. While the vent fan is effective, it’s noticeably loud on higher settings, something that might bother you during prolonged cooking sessions.

**Ease of Use with LG ThinQ**

The Smart Wi-Fi feature sparked some skepticism at first, but it became a handy addition. Using the LG ThinQ app to control the microwave remotely sounded like a gimmick, but scanning barcodes of frozen meals to automatically set cooking times and power levels was borderline genius. My younger sibling, who loves quick pre-packaged snacks, found this feature especially enjoyable. Additionally, syncing the microwave with my LG range allowed the vent and light to turn on or off automatically while cooking, which felt like a seamless touch of automation.

**Strengths**

- Sleek and modern design that elevates kitchen aesthetics.  
- Extremely easy to keep clean with the PrintProof finish.  
- Impressive Sensor Cook feature for foolproof reheating and cooking.  
- The innovative ExtendaVent 2.0 drastically reduces smoke and lingering cooking odors.  
- LG ThinQ integration with smart capabilities for added convenience.  

**Critiques**

- Vent fan is noticeably loud at higher speeds.  
- The microwave's size may not fit smaller or compact kitchen spaces.  
- ThinQ app setup takes a little time and patience during the first pairing.  

**Alternative Offerings**

While the LG MVEL2125F impresses in many areas, comparing it to peers like the GE JVM6175SKSS showed where it stands apart. The GE model offers slightly quieter operation but lacks the ExtendaVent feature and LG ThinQ smart integration. Samsung’s ME21M706BAS, on the other hand, rivals the LG in design but doesn’t provide as much coverage with its ventilation system. For those who value a combination of design, modern tech, and effective performance, the LG microwave edges ahead.

**Affordable Quality**

Considering its premium design, 2.1 cu. ft. capacity, and impressive features like Sensor Cook and ExtendaVent, the overall value for its price is hard to ignore. This microwave isn’t just about looks; it integrates features that cater to modern life while addressing real cooking challenges. While it’s not perfect, I believe the strengths outweigh the deficiencies, making it a sound pick for most family kitchens.

Our owner is the type I'm sure some of you had the misfortune to work with. He seems kind, but he doesn't accept any criticism towards his business. He always has a ""great idea"" that he tries to execute right away. He tries to get the most money out off the business right away and can't think in the long run. And whenever he makes a stupid decision that effects us (eg. our pay), he writes really long letters explaining how this will be good for us.

The problem is, I LOVE this cafe. I love my collegues, I love the people in the nearby stores, I love my regulars and I love our products. It makes me angry that they made me want to quit from here. And I think my (ex)collegues feel the same way.

We tolerated lots of bullshit for a shitty pay. Like when they fired all employees from a shop (there were problems, but firing everyone before giving any feedback or help - what the fuck). So instead of keeping it closed and renovating it (which it really needed) they assigned less shifts in my shop and made us work there as we instead for a month.

The last straw was when they fired our manager. Right after he worked as temporary manager for the store I mentioned and patched it up as much as he could. We had lots of theories and I heard two different explanation from the owner. My theory is that he had his own opinions which wasn't always the same as the owners. And he tried to keep us safe from their dumb decisions and told them when it was bullshit.

Now our CFO is acting manager. He's cool, but very overworked and can't stand up to the owner. The baristas do most manager tasks now. The biggest reason we stayed until now was our team, so when the first person quit we all followed soon after. The two fulltime employees didn't stay long after because they had to take the rest of their paid vacation time. The two of us parttimers have to stay the full 30 days while training the new guys.

So far they've hired 2 parttimers and 1 fulltime employee (who realised she should look for other jobs on her first day). They have barista experience, but as far as I can see some of them just barely. And no one has any experience in speciality. They only had 3 shifts where we trained them the best we could about everything. Since then they're doing their shifts (opener or closer - they have to know both already) alone with a 30 minute overlap with someone else. Yesterday I stayed for two hour overtime because we became more busy than usual and poor girl couldn't keep up. In that time I realised she often mixes up the size of our drinks, doesn't know how to make our teas, and didn't even know we had hot chocolate. She told me she didn't know latte art, and I thought it meant she's a begginer (which I wouldn't mind, she can practice here). But turns out she doesn't even know the basics and I don't have time to teach her. And it's not just her, they all have big gaps in their knowledge when it comes to speciality coffee. And it's NOT THEIR FAULT! They could probably be great if we could give them the chance to learn the way we did.

It makes me sad what will become of the cafe we love. Even if it helps us show the management how bad they fucked up. I also feel sorry for the new guys.

But hey, I made my first swan today, to end on a happy note. It looks a bit like it escaped from Chernobyl, but it makes me happy.",26,1752158509.0,barista,3,0.87,False

I’m a photographer, from Mauritius, living in Munich but currently visiting Berlin until Monday and I’m looking to explore more of the city — especially the creative and artsy side of it.

I’m super into photography (urban, street, portraits, experimental), and I’d love to discover cool photo spots, art exhibitions, unique architecture, creative events, or anything visually inspiring that’s happening around town. I’m especially into the slightly offbeat, raw and alternative side of things – so if you know any hidden gems, shoot! I‘m also really into the Techno scene and love a good party, so I‘m open for suggestions to go partying together. Sisyphos is the favorite club I‘ve been to so far!

Also, if anyone’s down to meet up for a coffee, photo walk, go party together, or just chat about art, life or music (techno, F1, food, whatever really), I’d be happy to connect. Always up to make new friends in the city 🌿📷

Dear Agent,

Seventeen-year-old Draven Vale never asked to be a detective for Death. But drowning in a lake seemed a poor alternative to Death’s blood-inked deal: in exchange for being brought back to life, Draven must solve classmate Julian Mallory’s murder within one year.

Now, autumn has returned. Draven’s deadline is a month away. Fueled only by coffee and desperation, Draven is running out of leads and red thread for his stringboard. That is, until a ouija board séance backfires, and Julian possesses Draven.  

The ghost of Julian is everything Draven isn’t: tender, justice-driven, and unnervingly *alive* for a dead boy. Though furious about the possession, Draven knows Julian is safest while they share a body. Without a vessel, Julian risks being consumed by Death—sucked dry of memory, reduced to a black-and-white husk like all the other ghosts. The boys are begrudgingly forced into a detective partnership. 

Their bickering-filled investigation leads them to Blair Hubbell—Julian’s charming ex and Draven’s prime suspect—who heads a secret society that bottles ghost memories as ink and drinks them to judge the worth of each life. Death doesn’t take kindly to stolen food. He’s hungry, not just for Julian’s killer, but now for Julian and the bottled memories too. As Blair’s true motives unravel and Julian’s repressed memories surface, Draven must decide: protect his own life, or risk it to defend the dead. Unwilling to lose Julian, Draven must abandon nihilism and fight for the fragile, everyday memories that everyone else would rather consume or forget.

THE ARCHIVE OF INK is a YA paranormal mystery novel complete at 92,000 words. It blends the prickly, intimate voice of Naomi Novik’s A DEADLY EDUCATION with the heart and humor of Aiden Thomas’ CEMETERY BOYS. \[personalization\]

**First 300** (Starts with a tape recording from Death to Draven! These recordings are interspersed throughout the novel):

***Recording Date: November 1st, 1981***

***Speaker: Death***

*Can you hear me? Is this old thing even rolling? Ehem, yes, well. I suppose there’s no easy way to say this, so here it is. You died. You were dead. The ashes to ashes, dust to dust, six feet under kind of dead. The kind of dead you can’t reverse.* 

*Trust me, I know what you’re thinking: how could you have died, when you’re living and breathing and listening to this tape right now? I don’t blame you if you’ve forgotten. Memories are spongy things, and they always take a while to soak back in—especially the ones we’d rather forget. Still, I won’t make you wait to hear from me. I know you humans hate eating up that sugared little thing you call time. So keep listening, my dear medium, and keep living. I’ll try to make this short and sweet.*

*You and I made a deal.* 

*A* deal...

*Hmph. You’ll have to forgive me—the word tastes unfamiliar on my tongue. I can’t remember the last time I made one. You are...a special case. When I heard you take your last breath, I knew this to be true. When I felt your vision fade, I saw so clearly the future you had with me. All it took was a scrap of parchment and bloodied ink, and just like that, the deal was done.*

*The exact details of our agreement aren’t important. You’ll remember it all soon enough. For now, there’s only one thing you need to understand.*

*You are alive because* I *allow it.* 

*Not fate, not god.* Me.

*I don’t make deals like this lightly. If you fail, I will reclaim you. And rest assured, I will savor the taste of your flesh.*

*You have one year to solve the case. Stay in touch, and happy haunting.*

1lwedsp,https://i.redd.it/jzej591562cf1.png,"[OC] Caffeine vs Sugar, Your Coffee Compass","Which drink should you choose?!

**A Sugar Trade off?** As drinks become more complex (i.e. more ingredients are added) the more sugar a drink will have, and the amount of caffeine tends to decrease. Think of it as, the more ingredients in a drink the more milliliters are in that drink, so for each sip you’re getting less caffeine and more sugar.

**The Flavor Journey:**  
Think of a basic espresso as a baseline. Once you start adding layers of flavor, you're not just creating complexity; you're also shifting the focus from a pure caffeine buzz to a broader taste experience with a sugar twist.

**The Ultimate Decision**

* **The Caffeine Boost:** Choose minimalist, ingredient-light drinks that pack a robust caffeine punch.
* **The Sugar Rush:** Choose maximalist, multiple ingredients blended in that offers a satisfying sugar rush along with a milder caffeine boost.

1lwebwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vietnamese/comments/1lwebwq/the_sweet_drinks_and_the_heart_behind_them/,The Sweet Drinks and the Heart Behind Them,"(There is tieng Viet below)

When I first came to Vietnam, I casually ordered coffee at a café, expecting a familiar bitter taste.

But the moment I took a sip, I was stunned — it was incredibly sweet.

Later, I learned that if you don’t want sugar, you have to say “không đường.”



In Korea, people have become more cautious with sugar due to rising concerns about diabetes.

So I initially found the sweetness a bit overwhelming — even unnecessary.

Honestly, I saw it negatively at first and thought, “Why do they make drinks this sweet?”



Then, one day, an Airbnb host I stayed with said something that changed my perspective:

“Offering something sweet means we care. It’s a way to show hospitality and respect to the guest.”

After hearing that, my whole view shifted.

A sweet drink wasn’t just a drink — it was an expression of warmth and welcome.



That moment made me realize how much kindness and generosity are embedded in Vietnamese culture.

It taught me that instead of criticizing what feels different, we should ask: “Why is it done this way?”

What might seem unusual or excessive to us could actually be a sign of care and respect.



Have you ever experienced a moment like this — when something felt strange at first but turned out to be meaningful once you understood the reason behind it?



https://preview.redd.it/ex3fsetm52cf1.jpg?width=4624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a37d3977629ccd626940dee0726fc4453f11097

Lần đầu tiên tôi đến Việt Nam, tôi gọi một ly cà phê tại quán mà không suy nghĩ nhiều.

Tôi tưởng rằng vị sẽ đắng như thường lệ, nhưng ngay ngụm đầu tiên tôi đã ngạc nhiên – cà phê ngọt lịm!

Sau đó tôi mới biết rằng nếu không muốn ngọt, phải nói “không đường.”



Ở Hàn Quốc, do lo ngại về bệnh tiểu đường, người ta thường tránh đồ uống có đường.

Vì thế lúc đầu tôi thấy vị ngọt này hơi khó hiểu, thậm chí là không cần thiết.

Tôi đã từng nghĩ: “Sao lại pha đồ uống ngọt đến như vậy?”

Nhưng rồi có một ngày, chủ nhà Airbnb nơi tôi ở đã nói một câu khiến tôi thay đổi suy nghĩ:

“Dọn đồ ngọt cho khách là để thể hiện sự quan tâm. Đó là cách thể hiện sự hiếu khách và tôn trọng.”



Sau khi nghe câu đó, tôi đã suy nghĩ lại tất cả.

Một ly đồ uống ngọt không chỉ đơn thuần là món giải khát — nó là một cách chào đón, một sự ấm áp.

Tôi nhận ra rằng người Việt thật sự giàu lòng nhân ái và có một nền văn hoá đầy tình cảm.

Trải nghiệm này dạy tôi rằng, thay vì phán xét điều khác biệt, hãy hỏi: “Vì sao họ lại làm như vậy?”

Điều có vẻ kỳ lạ đối với mình, đôi khi chính là biểu hiện của sự chu đáo với người khác.



Bạn đã từng trải qua khoảnh khắc nào như vậy chưa? Khi mà điều gì đó lúc đầu thấy lạ, nhưng sau lại hiểu được ý nghĩa sâu xa đằng sau?

1lwebuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1lwebuq/should_this_best_coffee_maker_bunn_csb3t_replace/,Should this best coffee maker BUNN CSB3T replace your brewer,"Having tested coffee makers regularly as part of my daily routine, I couldn’t wait to run the BUNN CSB3T through the paces. From the moment I unpacked it, this thermal coffee maker made a distinct impression with its sleek matte black finish and polished stainless-steel accents. It looked professional, almost like it belonged in a coffee shop instead of just my modest kitchen. The design is not just for show, though—it serves functional purposes that elevate this machine above the competition.

**Performance That’s Worth Noticing**

The brewing speed on this machine stunned me. Typically, other coffee makers I’ve tried take their sweet time heating water and dripping it through the grounds. But not with the BUNN CSB3T. Thanks to its commercial-grade stainless steel hot water tank, it stores hot water at brew-ready temperatures. This feature allows it to fill a travel mug in just two minutes or brew an entire 50-ounce carafe in only four minutes. Whether I was rushing out the door or hosting guests, it handled both situations exceptionally. Plus, the multi-stream spray head evenly distributed the water, and the vacuum-insulated thermal carafe kept coffee warm for hours without affecting its taste.

[Grab BUNN CSB3T at the best price on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b07gy6phyz/)

**Ease of Use**

The simplicity of the BUNN CSB3T stood out just as much as its speed. This isn’t one of those coffee makers requiring constant vigilance or an advanced degree in coffee science. A water level indicator on the pour-in bowl made filling the reservoir a hassle-free experience. Its manual operation means more control for me—whether I’m preparing a single cup or a full pot. The wide funnel design made loading the filters an oddly satisfying process because nothing spilled over, unlike other machines I’ve tested.

**Key Benefits**

- Rapid brewing capabilities save time.  
- Durable commercial-grade stainless steel tank ensures consistency.  
- Vacuum-insulated thermal carafe keeps coffee hot for extended periods.  
- User-friendly manual controls and sleek design suit any kitchen style.  

**Negatives That Might Matter to Some**

Even though I found the performance satisfying, a few small quirks stood out:  

- It always maintains hot water in the tank, which might slightly increase electricity usage.  
- Lacks advanced programmable features like timers or auto brew modes, options some people might miss.  
- The thermal carafe’s spout may spill if poured too aggressively, though it’s avoidable with careful handling.  

**High-Quality Materials and Maintenance**

Let’s talk durability because that’s something I care about in a coffee maker. My last machine gave up the ghost after just two years, and I have high hopes for this one. Made mostly of stainless steel, the BUNN CSB3T felt solid to the touch, and its parts didn’t rattle during use. The dishwasher-safe components, particularly the funnel and carafe, made cleanup a breeze—a welcome change compared to more fragile models I’ve owned. There’s no assembly required straight out of the box, either, so it’s delightfully plug-and-brew.

**Product Rivals**

Comparing it to others like the Ninja DualBrew or a Keurig K-Elite, both have their merits but lack the same speed and simplicity. Ninja’s model offers a range of brew styles, but its setup felt more cumbersome and time-consuming. With Keurig, pods often result in higher daily costs, and its coffee lacked the same robust, café-level taste I got from this drip machine. What the BUNN CSB3T lacked in extra bells and whistles, it made up for in essentials: reliability, speed, and consistently great coffee.

**Value for Money**

Given what it offers, the cost seemed appropriate and justified. It’s not the cheapest machine out there, but considering its lifespan, especially with durable components, plus the speed and quality of coffee it delivered, the price-to-quality ratio felt spot on. This is the kind of thing you invest in if you’re serious about great coffee and saving time.

When: July 4 - 6, 2025

Who: My wife and myself

THINGS TO KNOW WHEN PLANNING YOUR TRIP:

* For 2 nights out - recommended to start around 8am and hike 17.5mi Day 1 to Overland Lake and then 15mi Day 2 to Liberty, Favre or Castle Lakes, and 5mi out on Day 3. Begin day 1 around 8am since it is a long day that ends on a big climb. For a later start, go 11.5mi Day 1 to South Fork Smith Creek, then 18mi to Furlong Lake (reliable water), and 9mi out Day 3. 
* For 3 nights out - recommended to start later in the day, go 3mi to meadow at 4WD parking area (dry camp), 14mi to Overland Lake, \~15mi to Liberty, Favre, or Castle Lakes, and then 5mi out. 
* Fine to camp at the Harrison Pass Trailhead or further up the road along the Ruby Crest Trail route. 
* Many seasonal water sources for early July with the snow still melting. Still no water from Mile 20 to Mile 29. 
* No serious snow fields to navigate late june to early july (snow year dependent). Spikes recommended before that time period (snow year dependent). 
* For early July, we had no mosquitos. Lots of water. Lots of wildflowers. Though, quite a few people. Good temps (could be hot). 
* Limited camping at lakes on a holiday weekend. Getting more popular with no help from this post. 
* Not many options for bailing given that many of the trails shown on CalTopo/Gaia are unmaintained and hard to follow. This is a major downside to Gaia and CalTopo not showing what is maintained and what is not. More hikers use the Overland Lake Trail and it is maintained (verify). Good to call the local forest service office (or whoever maintains the Ruby's, I'm not sure) for water report, snow report, and verify which trails are maintained and unmaintained for bail-out options.  
* Check out Cowboy John Tours for a shuttle - $150 plus $50 per person after 2 (per the trip report back in 2023). 
* A fun option for shoulder season - add micro spikes for earlier season, add extra water for late season. 

Day 1 (17.5mi):

We camped at the Harrison Pass TH parking area. We came in super late the night before so didn't see any of this on our drive in, but there's plenty of other pull-off camping spots East of Harrison Pass along the road or further up along the road that's on the Ruby Crest Trail (RCT) about quarter mile near the cattle guard. That night at the TH camp, a huge wind, rain and hail storm came through. It was scary but mother nature got it out of her system and the weather for the rest of the trip was perfect. First 3 or so miles are on 4WD road, and then it turns to rugged 4x4 recreational vehicle type road (side by sides, dirt bikes, ATVs, etc.) for another 3 miles. Views all along here are good, and get better. From the official Ruby Crest National Recreation Trail sign (Mile 5.75), the trail doesn't seem well traveled, and many spots are overgrown. Most notably were the miles around Mile 10-14 where we really got scraped up and fed up. The scenery was still gorgeous and we both loved this section still. The climb up to (I'm calling it) Overland Lake Pass was a duzy with a false summit and a little snow field at the top. Amazing views of Tipton Peak to the South. A little high camp in the trees here would be cool. At the end of a 17.5mi day, it was a challenging climb with an incredible view looking into the basin of Overland Lake. This area is granite alpine heaven with cool craggy features and beautiful blue lakes. Lots of people camped here but there were still spots to set up. A fine camp with great fishing. Our day was about 9am - 6:30pm moving at a good pace with lots of little snack breaks.

Day 2 (14mi):

Lovely camping evening. Temps around mid 40s. The light little 40° EE quilt was perfect with just a fleece and leggings. We got up and moving around 8am after coffee and a warm breakfast. Filled up some water about a mile away from Overland Lake. A solid climb up to Peak 10207 with great views. A nice little shady spot at the top for a 10am snack. The next section takes you up and down many climbs and descents with high exposure and big views. The trail is AMAZING throughout the day with perfect gravel, little to no tripping hazards, and a nice grade for fast walking. Much improved from Day 1, that's for sure. Not much shelter if it were stormy. You have the possibility to get a little more adventurous and stay exactly on the ridge line for this section if you wanted. Fun scrambling/hiking and i'd say Wines Peak is nothing special. Just the same views. All the views are up and down the range. Nothing really to look at in the barren landscape outside of the Ruby's IMO. Cruiser trail leads to pine forests with your first water in a while. I dug up the best pooping hole in the history of pooping holes. Great privacy near a big boulder and tree, no roots, could dig down 8"" easily and quickly, great view, AND my shit was high quality. So all-around 5 star poop. Anyway, a little bit of a climb to a pass overlooking your trail miles behind you, and nice views of healthy alpine forests ahead. The trail contours around to the Favre Lake area with a nice creek and nice camping here. Lots of options to continue on to Liberty Lake (gorgeous) or add a bonus mile to Castle Lake (also gorgeous). Fishing here is easy and fun either in the lakes or in the Creek from the lake outlet. Busy camping near here with options to be more along in the meadows away from the lake and trail. We got into camp around 4pm so plenty of time to nap, read, fish, chat, and eat dinner. No bugs! So lovely. 

Day 3 (5.5mi):

Even warmer last night with upper 40s. No leggings. Just fleece. So cozy. WONDERFUL hiking past Liberty Lake and over Liberty Pass down to Lamoille Lake where we took a frigid dip to clean off some of the stink before getting picked up by my friend/coworker to shuttle us back to our car. Not sure it helped. The hiking through the pine forests here is amazing and the granite crags and snow fields make it feel like you're really far away from home. This is a wonderful end to the hike, though that town day brain maybe doesn't appreciate it enough. I think doing it in the reverse order would also be fun too just to change it up, or if you wanted to start later in the day since camping 5mi in at Liberty, Favre or Castle Lakes works out for the logistics of the rest of the hike. 

TL;DR it's a great trail! Go do it. 

GEAR:

A perfect trip to go as light as you can. This time of year and a favorable weather forecast I went no puffy, no gloves, lightest fleece (alpha 90), lightest leggings (alpha 60), lightest raincoat (skylight 2.5oz), lightest hat (off-brand fleece), lightest sleeping pad (Uberlite), lightest quilt (EE 40°, 12oz). I didn't need my wind pants (they were for bugs that didn't exist). My luxury items were my little flextail pump, my big-ass pillow w/ buff, my camera, my tenkara rod, and a GG AirFlow SitLite pad for the back panel of my pack.The back panel was nice since we had more time in camp than we usually do, and the pack was more comfortable than putting the sleeping pad there as I usually do. I felt less lumps from my food bag, and the pad maybe breathed a little better on my back vs a CCF thinlite or something?? But the gridstop fabrics don't breath so maybe that's not a thing... My wife had this too and we both liked it. Maybe we will try them on the outside of our packs next and bring back the shock cord along the outside of the back panel to make it more breathable. 

My Durston Xmid 2 Pro... first gen. Fuck the magnetic vestibule door holders. I know he improved those later I think but even after removing the extra layer of DCF tape (recommended fix) the magnets don't hold the door if a fart is even close to it. Not sure what I can do here. Also, the trekking pole elastic cord at the footprint ripped out without much force when taking down the tent. Not a big deal and easily fixable. Other than that I've liked this tent. We've done about 5 or so trips in it and we are happy overall. The first night we had a good breeze coming across and the tent was flapping a bit from the trekking pole end sinking into the ground a bit. Easy to just sit up, extend the pole more, BOOM tight pitch again. Easy. I'd recommend this tent especially with the newer versions/upgrades as Durston has dialed it all in. 

My wife and I both rocked the Nashy Cutaway once again. Both loving them still but my wife's pack has hardly any extra roll top fabric like mine does (older design). Nashy said they did this on purpose to prevent people from overfilling it and stressing out the pack outside of its intended use, but when you have an XS female torso and still almost the same size and number of backpacking items... her pack volume is quite a bit smaller than the 18"" or larger torso lengths with no extra roll top... anyway, they can accommodate your wishes on the sewing machine. They are awesome folks over there and I recommend you get the extended collar like the old design. 

Happy to answer any other gear questions from what I brought along. ",2,1752158060.0,Ultralight,3,0.67,False

I’m new to the Airstream world by way of my amazing boyfriend who has a gorgeous 27’ Flying Cloud FB. We have the solar system that came from the factory; the original owner upgraded just about everything. 

Currently boondocking around Nova Scotia and solar isn’t the best- he’s running the Starlink and his laptop off of a huge power bank which cuts down of the battery draw. We are also using portable chargers for portable electronic devices and charging things at coffee shops when we can. 

My question is should I buy a couple of extra portable panels that I can integrate into the system and that can be moved through the day or just get a generator? With the generator we’d want something compact and quiet (Honda). 

My dad’s an airline mechanic so as a kid I graduated from, “hand me the wrench”, to, “go do this”. Not afraid of a little work.  

Happy camping from two gays in a moving studio apartment exploring the east coast of North America.

Please be kind, its my first post and I hope I'm doing this right.

My partner (37f) and I (42f) are on vacation and I put on a new shirt, with some nice shorts.  The tank top has thick straps tank and is long.  It covers my bigger belly and I thought I looked good and felt good, that is until my partner looked at me and before they could say anything judgmental (its a pattern in our relationship that they make me change and put it to down to social etiquette)  I asked that she keep it to herself.  She continued to look at me while she got ready and couldn't help herself and asked if I had a t shirt to wear instead.  I repeated I didn't want to hear it.  It's a shirt she bought me, so even before I put it on I had that in my head, thinking it would be acceptable.  We were headed to a breakfast buffet in a nicer hotel, but I have seen other people wearing similar outfits, but we have not gone to the buffet yet so I can't be sure about how people are dressed there.  


I said let's go to the food trucks instead and she agreed.  When I went to leave she said she wanted to talk, I said I didn't want to and needed some space.  She said take your space then, so I left.  


After grabbing a coffee, going for a walk and collexting my thoughts, I text that I was hurt and felt insecure because of the judgements over the last 4 years (the length of our relationship) because she will make comments and judgments about what I wear.  I usually change and feel like shit when I do, but I thought we had compromised and were going to the food truck instead.  I text her that it was a shitty way to start our last day here and that I'm hurt and disappointed that she is more concerned about others opinions rather than her partners feelings.  And that she couldn't keep her opinions to herself when I asked her to.  All she responded with was that she wished I had changed and then we could have had a wonderful day.  I couldn't believe she doubled down and didn't acknowledge a single thing I said and that the only way we can have peace is if I adhere to her wants.  I said that was unfair and manipulative.   She repeated that she is just asking for what is socially acceptable and that is where she draws the line. 

I am not sitting here wondering AITA for not changing or do I have the right to express my hurt and ask her to keep her opinions to herself?  I consider social etiquette to be subjective and I think I look nice, but perhaps my insecurities are taking hold and I'm being stubborn.   I need some outside perspective. So AITA?",1,1752157892.0,AITAH,5,0.67,False

Thinking about the future is blurry, at best. Nothing that I have wanted to do while my mom was alive is attracting me anymore.

I force myself to talk with my friends, sometimes even go get a coffee, but their topics don't interest me anymore.

The job I work I am now working with inertia. Just getting things done. Sometimes not even that. 

I cry so much lately. I'm completely alone in my house. Nobody to say good morning or good night to. 

People rarely call me. I have to reach out to them. They are also less and less willing to talk about my mom.

I genuinely have **no will to do anything, to plan for anything, to hope for anything.**

It has been only just over a month since my mom's passing, but I am actively considering therapy. That and time are the only thing that I have some hope in. If this grief continues for over a year, I don't know how I will be able to make it. 

I have already asked on this subreddit, but I have to do it again: **does it get more bearable, any different, after 6 months or a year?** Please be honest.",6,1752157707.0,GriefSupport,2,1.0,False

Hello everyone! **BigHedDjango** here, tunes for this week to help you out.

**All feedback on tunes is appreciated - good or bad. Specially when tunes are bad.** At the end of the day I am just the mechanic and you guys are the racers. Do not hesitate irrespective of your tuning knowledge or racing skills!

**Tuning method:**
1. **Stock look - stock wheel rims and size, no aero (unless absolutely necessary for handling and stability)**
2. Tuned for automatic/manual players by not skipping clutch+gearbox upgrades
3. Max performance with max handling possible
4. All cars **tuned vs. Unbeatable AI**, tracks/weather conditions are now unknown since time travel no longer works. Since release AI has been inconsistent between many car types and weather conditions, not every car will win 10/10 races vs Unbeatable AI without rewind/restart abuse
5. Bodykit used if it does not hurt performance

I am just beginning so this is as far as I have gone. The experience was awesome, as they say. I am keeping a diary of what I experience. I have copied my experience and pasted it here. I wanted to find out if what I experienced is ""normal"". Thank you. 

2nd attempt at I AM. First time I did this was lying in bed. Did it for about 20 minutes and then went to sleep. Did not notice anything spectacular. Probably wasn't a good idea to do it in bed as it is too relaxing and I was sleepy when I did it. 

Had coffee, no food prior to beginning:

Next time, sat in my office chair with doors closed. Palms on thighs. After some time, felt as though I was about to float out of top of head but only very briefly. Felt like a floating sensation. This happened twice. 

Then after some more time, an overwhelming tingling sensation washed over my body and became stronger and stronger. I noticed my breathing change with it. It was intense like a wave similar to waves of ecstasy one has in approaching orgasm. It was definitely sexual in nature and ran throughout my entire body, not just one area. 

When it first started however it also resembled the feeling one gets when one experiences some excitement of the kind that gives one goose bumps and butterflies. Similar to what may be referred to as an adrenal rush but, but a good one. This tingly sensation of excitement soon led to the waves of ecstasy described above.

After several moments of this it was almost as though I could take no more, and then it backed off for some moments. Then a second wave came like the first. I actually made some verbal sound as a sigh or groan as it continued and my breathing became heavier and deeper. I noticed too I felt like I might be trembling but am not sure now whether my body was actually trembling or it just felt that way. 

After this second wave passed, for some reason I was ready, perhaps even anxious, to end the session but was aware that I was supposed to do this for a full twenty minutes. I looked at my clock and saw that I still had a little more than 5 minutes or so to go so resumed it. After some moments, again, the feeling started to come as described above but this time it was more jolting, not as smooth as the first two. I felt this jolt twice. After some moments I ended the session, having gone a total of about 20 minutes. I took several deep breaths and remained sitting and rested as advised and then wrote this so that I forgot nothing.

A1: Thank you for writing and sharing. 

You are off to a very good start, finding out right away the difference between meditating lying down and sitting up! Keep in mind that your experiences will vary over time, sometimes very deep, sometimes with lots of energy (even sexual - you will read more on that in later lessons), other times dull, and sometimes a bit restless. All experiences are correct as long as we favor the easy procedure of meditation. What is important is long term daily practice. That is what purifies and opens our nervous system. See lesson [\#180](https://www.aypsite.org/180.html) with a response to someone having strong start like you did. 

Our experiences during practices are mostly due to purification going on in our nervous system, and will vary greatly. Even ecstatic experiences are largely purification. It all comes out according to how the impressions of past actions are stacked inside. There is no accounting for it, and all we have to do is our procedure of practice, and purification and opening happens. So, don't become too attached to experiences that occur in meditation. Practice is good if we follow the procedure, no matter what happens experientially in our sitting. Of course we all love blissful and ecstatic experiences. Enjoy them when they happen. But keep in mind that experiences are symptoms, not the practice itself. We don't want to become distracted from our practice by experiences that come up. So when experiences come, we notice them, and go back to the practice we are doing. That is what keeps us going forward toward enlightenment. As you read through, you will encounter many lessons that discuss this from a variety of angles. 

Q2: Thank you. I am somewhat relieved to know that I don't necessarily have to expect to repeat that experience. Otherwise I may have thought I was doing something wrong if nothing happened next time. 

I just read lesson #39 & #41 on pranayama, which I have not yet tried. I did some deep breathing before starting my meditation on I AM that morning. Maybe that was one reason my experience was so dramatic. 

I am taking another course that gives the sound OOMM to chant. I haven't been doing it lately but thought I would start again. I saw one of the Q&As where you state the difference between ""I AM"" and ""OMM"", that latter being circular. But I am wondering if I should wait a while after the meditation to do my OMMM chanting. 

I have several questions: 

Can you tell me when I should start trying spinal breathing pranayama? That is, are there a certain number of days that one should do the I AM meditation before they do the pranayama exercise? Also is it advisable to set an egg timer so that I will know when my 20 minutes are up? Is it necessary to do it 2x per day to achieve optimum results? Do you state somewhere in the Q&A why the lotus position is better than sitting in a chair? 

I am really surprised at how powerful that mediation technique is. I still can't believe it. I had always wondered at the significance of the phrase I AM in the Bible. Now I am even more curious and want to go back through all the places where it is referenced. 

My husband is going to try it sitting up now. He too had only tried it lying down before so I am anxious to hear of his results. I didn't tell him about mine because I didn't want him to be expecting a certain result.

A2: Given that you have just started and have lots happening already, it would be wise to stabilize your meditation practice for at least a few weeks before adding pranayama. Then you will have a good platform from which to expand. As you read through the lessons you will see a lot on ""self-pacing,"" which is essential for success in yoga. You already have seen the first lesson on this (#38) called ""What is your time line?"" A very important subject - more important than any single practice. Without a skilled driver, the car is not likely to reach its destination. 

Self-pacing applies to taking on other practices outside AYP too, which is risky to begin with because the effects in combination with AYP practices can be unpredictable. You are in charge of your journey. Be measured in your approach, always stabilizing what you have before moving ahead. Each person is different. Stabilizing could take weeks or months. In some cases (as with mantra enhancements and advanced pranayama-kumbhaka methods given later in the lessons) it could take years. A few days will rarely do it. Even experts in yoga have to apply prudent self-pacing in practices to accommodate the many experiences that come up as the nervous system goes though stages of purification. So, satisfy your thirst for knowledge by reading on, but build your routine very gradually so you can remain consistent in your practices over the long term. That is how enlightenment happens. Rome was not built in a day.

It is okay to use an egg timer for meditation, but don't become too dependent on it. It is best to develop the inner clock for timing practices, with occasional peeking at the watch or clock as necessary. Once we have this ""inner clock"" skill, then using an egg timer is not our sole means of timing. That way, if you are without your egg timer, you won't be at a loss. 

Siddhasana (not lotus) is the way of sitting that the lessons evolve toward. You will see why as you read on. It is a simple and powerful practice for raising ecstatic energy. The cultivation of inner silence and ecstatic energy, and their natural union (inner lovemaking of ""shiva and shakti"" or ""father and holy spirit""), is the key to human spiritual transformation. 

On the twice a day, read lesson #148. Many of your questions you can find answers to in the [topic index](https://www.aypsite.org/TopicIndex.html) on the web site, or by using the site search feature. I will be happy to help with anything that you cannot find a satisfactory answer on.

The methods in the lessons are the simplest and most powerful I have encountered over more than three decades on the path, integrated together into a system of practices. So, yes, this is all very powerful stuff. Use good self-pacing, avoid tangents (lots of those will tempt you), and you can go very far with this over the long term. Enjoy! 

Q3: Thank you much again. Yesterday I again received the waves washing over me, up and down which felt as I can best describe, as an electrical current. I noticed my breathing began to change each time this occurred causing me to take deeper breaths, which I immediately corrected. I soon found that I could control the waves at will. Not sure if I should allow them or discourage them? 

I also noticed my head began both times to rock gently back and forth and then to eventually sway side to side in what seemed a figure 8. After the experience, I did a search under ""swaying"" and found where one of your students also experienced swaying but with his entire body. I read your responses about not letting all these sensations detract from the main purpose. 

For the first time today, I did my meditation in the lotus position with my back against my couch. It wasn't as comfortable and was a bit distracting a few times but I managed to keep directing my attention away from the discomfort and concentrate on the mediation. The electrical waves came again, but this time were a lot more subtle. And again when the breathing intensified I immediately stopped it and calmed it and stayed quiet. 

I did away with the egg timer and peeked at the clock again. I think I may have been a little more anxious to end the session because of the position I was in. When it was over, my lower leg was asleep. I didn't see any instruction on ""when"" we should start the lotus position. I did see lesson [\#33](https://www.aypsite.org/33.html). I will start doing some exercises to limber my joints up a bit which I remember from ballet school many a year ago. I still felt my mediation was good though it wasn't quite as smooth as in the sitting position. 

A3: You are having the classic symptoms of what I call ""automatic yoga,"" from just a few days of meditation. It goes without saying that you have come ""wired"" for this from past lives of work in yoga. We are all wired for it by virtue of our human nervous system. Some have more neural conductivity than others because they have done direct work on the circuitry before. You are one of those, and now you are picking up where you left off. We all have the same journey and destination - purification and opening of our nervous system to unending ecstatic bliss and outflowing divine love. 

By automatic yoga, I mean physical, mental and emotional tendencies coming up out of nowhere, seemingly unrelated to the practice we are doing. This happens because there is a connectedness of yoga throughout our nervous system. This is explained in more detail later in the lessons, particularly in discussing the ""eight limbs of yoga,"" first introduced in Lesson 149. For now, just know that your rising desire to study, practice, take on more, etc. is all coming from the few dives you have taken into pure bliss consciousness within. So too are the bending legs, breathing symptoms, and head movements from this. Pretty amazing, isn't it? The lessons will help you guide all of these tendencies step by step into a safe and effective routine of practices. 

When movements or deep breathing come up in meditation, we don't entertain them, or force them out. We just easily go back to the procedure of meditation, picking up the mantra at whatever level of refinement we left it, and let it continue to refine. 

Breathing generally becomes very quiet during meditation, as the metabolism slows way down. If it is getting deeper or is speeding up, that could be associated with ecstatic energies beginning to move. Don't dwell on that, as it will take your attention away from the simple process of meditation. When you begin spinal breathing (a separate practice done before meditation), then you will have the opportunity to cultivate the ecstatic energies in a progressive and balanced way. Favor the procedure for using the mantra during meditation over anything that comes up. The same goes for head movements and other symptoms that can occur - just easily let it go in favor of meditation. Much later in the lessons, you will see that head movements also will be part of practices in the form of an advanced method called ""chin pump."" That is way down the road though. You are just starting out. Take things one step at a time. Gently favor the practice you are doing, no matter what else comes up. If some of these things become so strong that they seem to be dominating your meditation time, then just be easy and let your attention be with the movements or sensations (without encouraging them) for a few minutes without picking up the mantra. That will help stabilize the energy flow. Then after a few minutes you can go back to meditation. 

On the folding legs, the lessons do not teach lotus (feet up on thighs). We use siddhasana instead, which is a more direct means for cultivating the ecstatic energies within. Once you get through spinal breathing, mulabandha, and sambhavi, you will come to siddhasana. You are doing right to be loosening up the legs now. No need to go up on the thighs with your feet though - just develop some comfort having the legs folded with toes tucked under a bit, as discussed in lesson [\#33](https://www.aypsite.org/33.html). This builds a foundation for things to come, with a minimum of distraction to meditation. If it becomes too distracting, ease off the folded legs. Try one folded until two works. Try legs folded only one sitting out of two each day. It is a gradual process of adjustment that can takes weeks or months to work into. In the meantime, keep as comfortable as possible while meditating. In time, sitting with legs folded will be completely natural and unnoticed during practices. So will siddhasana, except for the fountain of unending ecstasy coming up from it. Well, that is another subject. 

Timing for taking on new practices is discussed in the course of the lessons. It has to do with your ability to assimilate things more than anything. That is why specific times are not given. Everyone is different. The main thing is not to get too far ahead of yourself. Even that is not the end of the world in the short term, as long as you know to back off when you get a little too far ahead of your nervous system's ability to digest new practices. It is a process of always testing, stepping forward, and stepping back -gradually learning the ropes of this wonderful transformable spiritual vehicle we are living in - the human nervous system! 

Q4: I took a quick skim of the chin pump article (#139) and it seems that describes something very similar to what was happening to me.

This is getting quite exciting but I want to take it step by step as you suggested so I didn't read it in detail. There are so many articles that to do otherwise would be very difficult in any case. Yesterday for the first time, I did the meditation twice. My legs were just crossed. (I haven't even attempted the lotus position & am glad to hear we won't be expected to use it!) Again, sitting cross legged was very distracting but once I got into the meditation it became smoother. 

I am wondering about the meditation on ""I AM"". Over the past weeks before I found your yahoo group and website, I had been doing a mental affirmation throughout the day, ""I am in harmony with Christ"". I even have a pillow speaker under my pillow with me speaking that affirmation. The reason for this was that I had read in one of the books I am currently reading (reading Spalding on the Siddha Masters, Collier, Trine & Hill so I get them mixed up sometimes) and one them had said that one of the reasons for sickness, stress, etc. was being out of harmony with Christ. Also they all talk about us as being Divine, that God is within us. I suppose I grew up like a lot of people thinking about Him as being up there somewhere separate from us.

So sometimes in my meditation, while thinking I AM, I am thinking of God then I alternate with just meditating on the words ""I AM"" without thinking of God. So I suppose I'm uncertain as to how to think/feel when I think ""I AM"".

At one point, for just a few seconds last night in my second session, it seemed I stepped out and forward from the meditation on the words, into a circle with some colors and there were no words or thinking. It was just like a complete separation from thought and body. But it was just for seconds and then I was back thinking I AM. This occurred a couple of times very briefly. I wanted to explore it more but it didn't happen again. It was as though I was on the very edge of something but couldn't quite get there. Then during this morning's mediation, I felt that same separateness but this time rather than moving up into a circle I felt as though I were falling backwards and floating into that separateness. Again, all thought of thinking I AM and my body was forgotten. It was so 'still'. I wanted it to last longer again but it was only for a few seconds a couple of times. For the first time since beginning the meditation, I wasn't anxious to come out of it. I was content to stay there but went ahead and ended it at 20 minutes since that's what you have advised.

I do have a question that is confusing me even while I meditate:

Should I think of God as I meditate I AM or try just to meditate I AM without its meaning or thinking of God or my Divine nature? Should I try to divorce the meditation form thoughts of God?

I wanted to check about something new that happened last night. 

Yesterday and last night I noticed at times, my breathing was so slight, that once I thought I had stopped breathing. But the newest thing is last night, the area in my solar plexus was pressed inward to such a degree that it felt as though my entire rib cage was exposed with the area in the middle under the breastbone going inward. It must have actually been drawn inward towards my back for I could feel the movement under my breast. It wasn't painful, just really intense. I didn't think I was holding my breath and cannot remember now this morning exactly how my breathing was when this happened. I should have made notes right after this. So naturally again I am wondering about this and if you have ever heard of this happening?

A4: The mantra is used for sound only, not meaning. In the [topic index](https://www.aypsite.org/TopicIndex.html) you can find several lessons on this under ""mantra - language and meaning."" Another way to spell the ""I AM"" mantra is ""AYAM."" Same pronunciation. None of this takes away from the meaning and mystique of the Christian phrase, ""I AM."" It is just that when we use it as a mantra, it is the vibration that matters, not the English meaning. My background is Christian also.

So, when thoughts come up in meditation regarding the meaning of I AM, or God, or whatever, we just treat them like any other thoughts that come up and easily go back to the mantra. The same is true for all experiences we have in meditation, no matter how ecstatic, profound, revelatory, strange, or dramatic - when we realize we are off into something, no matter what, we just easily go back to the mantra. That is the procedure of meditation.

Ah, you noticed the breathing slowing down and nearly stopping. As   
mentioned before, that is normal.

The diaphragm pulling in and up is another of those automatic yogas. It is called ""uddiyana."" You can find discussions on it in the practices section (top) of the [topic index](https://www.aypsite.org/TopicIndex.html), under ""uddiyana/nauli.""

Take it step-by-step, and enjoy!

Q5: So in other countries, in other languages they also use ""I AM"" rather than their translation of ""I AM""?

I just did a quick read of the article you referred to on uddiyana. This is so incredible that my body is doing all of these things on its own. Though I hadn't mentioned it, my tongue has also been cupping and pressing against the roof of my mouth near the front. I didn't realize it was something that you consciously try to do. I guess whatever my body starts to do from here on, I can safely assume it knows better than I.

I am trying to follow everything step by step. By my body jumping into all of these things on its own, am I at risk in not developing properly since I seem to be doing things out of order? I only start out by thinking to do only the mediation. These things are just happening on their own. I've had some other things happen as well that I may later learn are automatic yoga. 

A5: Yes, since we are using the sound of I AM (AYAM) and not the meaning, translation of meaning into other languages is not advised. The sound has a universal vibratory resonance in the human nervous system. That's why I call it a universal mantra. 

Ah, the tongue has gone up? That is called ""kechari,"" a very important one we talk about a lot in the later lessons. You can look it up in the [topic index](https://www.aypsite.org/TopicIndex.html).

With all this coming up, I can see that you are a little concerned about how to manage it going forward. I suggest you don't even try. Just do your practices according to plan, taking on new ones gradually over the coming months and years, with the priority being to establish stable practice each step along the way. Whatever comes up as automatic yoga, regard with equanimity, and stay the course with structured daily practice over the long term. If you do that, then all these things will fit together naturally in due course.

Given your fast moving situation, the most important things I recommend you keep in mind are patience and self-pacing in practices. If you try and accommodate all that is going on at the same time, it will be very difficult. You have many gifts of yoga sprouting there. Tend your garden with care, day by day, and you will travel far. 

Always remember that the most important practice is deep meditation. This is what cultivates our foundation of inner silence underneath all of the external hub-bub. Without it we will be flailing about in the wind, with no center, no matter how much automatic yoga we have going on. Inner silence (pure bliss consciousness) is the key to all progress in yoga. 

As it says in the psalms, ""Be still, and know I am God."" 

Q6: Thank you for your answer to my many questions. I was a little concerned about how to manage these things but that has now been put to rest by your answer. I will proceed methodically as though these things weren't happening.

Yesterday, I only did the meditation (with spinal breathing) once rather than twice. I had been for several days, experiencing a difficulty in putting my mind/energy on the more mundane tasks that my work requires. I had no motivation to do my work and thought that it might be a result of the mediation. I remember that you have stated that it is advisable to rest after the meditation and I never really did that beyond a minute or two at most so perhaps that is what I needed to do. 

But I decided yesterday to try doing without the morning session and only did the evening session. I looked in your Q&A for any info on whether you are to do it everyday, 7 days a week or if it's desirable to perhaps occasionally skip a day or one of the two sessions once in a while at least at the beginning. It may be there in the postings but I didn't find anything that addressed this question.

One other thing I wanted to ask about: I had written after my second or third mediation that I had found I could control the waves of energy charge that pulsed through my body at will. It started off happening without conscious effort but then I found I could make it happen again with minor effort. But lately, the last couple of days, I have been experiencing this in my daily routine out of mediation as well. At times during the day or night I feel the urge to push this energy current through my body at will. It might be while making a protein shake or working at my computer or while watching the news. It's becoming somewhat addictive I think. It's happening at least once about every hour. If I don't do it willingly, then it comes on its own. I don't feel it's a bad thing. It feels rather pleasant and gives me an unexplainable feeling of empowerment. Is this an enhancement of my spiritual powers or merely a part of the purification process?

A6: Yes, taking it easy, and one day at a time, is the best approach. It is the best approach whenever big changes come into our life - our system is opening us up to become infinite pure bliss consciousness encompassing the entire universe! 

Yes, the experiences are part of purification and will change - expand actually, so there is much more to come. And yes, it can be addictive. That is in the very first lesson - my addiction to yoga and the experiences it brings. To borrow a word from the 12 step program for addicts, maybe we are all ""recovering"" yogis and yoginis. Recovering what is ours that has been long lost, that is. It is not primarily about the ecstatic experience of the moment. It is about something infinitely bigger than the greatest ecstatic pleasure we can have today. Enjoy your experiences, and incorporate them into your everyday life. The best way to do that is by taking your bliss and sharing it with others in simple ways. Simple living for the benefit of others is the best way I know to keep rising ecstatic experiences from going to our heads. That's part of why I am writing these lessons. What good is rising enlightenment if it is unshared? Not much good at all. Down-right self-indulgent. The truth is, enlightenment can't happen fully until it is shared in service for the benefit of others, because enlightenment is, by nature, all-encompassing. 

It is not our fault that the true nature of life is ecstatic bliss. The human nervous system is an ecstasy machine. Should we run from that? I don't think so. As we move into our natural state of ecstasy, we can do so with responsibility. That is how we can make the journey. Ecstatic bliss must flow outward to the world to find its fruition, and so too must we. To do anything less is a form of spiritual hedonism. We may do that for a while, just indulge inwardly in our ecstatic experiences. That's okay. Sooner or later we will go out into the world with our ecstatic bliss. It is inevitable. Along the way in yoga, we unravel one of the greatest of all mysteries through our direct experience - the role of sexuality in human spiritual transformation. 

As for daily practices, it is better to stick with two sessions every day, because developing and maintaining the habit is so very important. This was covered in a lesson not long ago ([\#209](https://www.aypsite.org/209.html)) called, ""Fitting daily practices into a busy schedule."" I know that lack of time is not the reason you have tried cutting back to one session, but that lesson gets into the reasons why keeping the twice daily habit is so important. So does lesson #148, ""Why practices twice a day?"" 

If you are feeling a bit over-stimulated in your practices, then the thing to do is cut back on time in the twice daily sittings. If you are doing 5 minutes spinal breathing and 20 minutes meditation, and are having too much happening, then, rather than doing it once a day, try cutting breathing back to a few minutes and meditation to 15 minutes twice a day. If that is still too much, then try meditation at 10 minutes. It can be ramped back up later as your nervous system adjusts to the energies. This is the all-important topic of ""self-pacing"" which is discussed extensively in the lessons. The key is to find a balanced and stable twice daily routine. That way, we can cultivate inner silence and ecstatic energies in our nervous system and stabilize them in activity using a twice daily cycle, which is much more effective than doing a once daily cycle with longer practice. Of course, there will be times that we are too pressed for time or too exhausted to do much of anything at practice time. Then we just keep the habit by sitting for a minute or two with eyes closed. See how that works? It is about the twice daily habit. As they say, ""use it or lose it."" We can be flexible with our times and practices within that twice daily commitment, as necessary. 

Q7: I had a session yesterday that was, well all I could think afterwards was WOW! I had had two days of quieter mediation with the usual 'automatic' head rocking and circling but the experience was much milder and quieter without all the involuntary surges of energy as before and no new automatic yoga experiences.

So I decided to move on and incorporate lessons #41, #54 & #55 (on spinal breathing, kundalini, and mulabandha) in my session yesterday. The experience was the most powerful I have had yet and there were a lot of new things, what you call ""automatic yoga"" going on I think. 

A7: As you add on new practices, keep in mind that there can be a delayed reaction in effects. So we don't really know all of what a new practice is doing for a few weeks at least. If you have piled on two or three new practices, and things take off, it may be hard to figure out what is doing what - and that's when self-pacing gets tricky - what to back off on when the energy is flying everywhere? Getting a bit ahead of yourself is not the end of the world, as long as you know to back off when necessary for a smoother ride. You'll get the hang of it. 

Just remember you have a spiritual Ferrari there (an extra fast one) and you have to learn how to drive the thing without running off the road. You are in the driver's seat. 

All the best on your journey. Vrrrooom!

It started small like she'd move my salt and pepper to what she thought was a better spot or mess with how I had my coffee mugs arranged. I didn't say anything because complaining about that seemed pretty petty.

But then last month she completely reorganized my spice cabinet while I was making dinner. She told me my system didn't make sense and alphabetical was obviously better. Took me forever to find anything after that because I had my own way of organizing things.

Two weeks ago she folded all my laundry that was on the couch. Sounds nice right? Wrong. She put everything in completely wrong places. My husband's work shirts ended up in my drawer, mixed up all the kids clothes, and somehow my underwear ended up with the kitchen towels.

This past Sunday I come out of the kitchen and find her reorganizing my bookshelf and throwing away what she called old magazines. Except they weren't magazines they were my recipe cards in magazine holders and some of them were handwritten ones from my grandmother who passed away.

I asked her to please stop moving my things and explained about the recipe cards. She got all defensive saying she was just trying to help and my house needed organization. My husband sided with her and said I should appreciate that she cares enough to help clean.

1lwe15a,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/1lwe15a/thinking_about_orthodoxy_a_few_candid_deeper/,"Thinking about Orthodoxy? A few candid, deeper thoughts.","

Many seekers today — especially in America, and especially online — come to Orthodoxy with a consumer mindset. They evaluate: Is the priest attentive enough? Was the sermon inspiring? Did the choir sound good? Were people warm and welcoming?

It’s not really their fault. Most of us were shaped in a culture that measures everything by how well it serves us — even church.

At the same time, many who find themselves drawn to Orthodoxy carry deep wounds. Some arrive suspicious, scarred by hypocrisy or by those who failed to shepherd them well. Others come simply lonely, hungry for something true but unsure how to trust. They’re looking for something real.

Here’s the paradox: Orthodoxy doesn’t exist to comfort us on our own terms. It doesn’t reshape itself around our preferences or move at our chosen pace. It’s here to heal us — and that healing often begins by pulling us out of the very center of our own story and placing Christ there instead. When that shift happens, so much of the consumer mindset fades. It changes how we see the Church, how we see others, how we live with waiting and mystery — because it’s no longer about satisfying us, but about being joined to Him. And surprisingly, this is where the deepest joy starts to break through.

Orthodoxy is also profoundly comfortable with mystery. Many Christian traditions try to define everything, to fit God into tidy systems. Orthodoxy takes a different path. We often speak of God through apophatic theology, saying more of what God is not than presuming to declare exactly what He is.

St. Gregory of Nyssa put it strikingly:

> “Concepts create idols; only wonder comprehends anything. People kill one another over idols. Wonder makes us fall to our knees.”



That doesn’t mean we know nothing of God. It means we recognize that whatever we say is partial. We can point to the mysteries — stand before them, be changed by them, even stake our lives on them — but we can’t encompass all they are. So sometimes you won’t understand. You may stand in services and feel lost. You may hear hymns or see gestures that seem foreign. That’s not a flaw to fix; it’s a sign you’re encountering something larger than you, something that takes time, humility, and prayer to begin to perceive.

So if you’re exploring Orthodoxy, try setting aside the question, “What can this parish or priest do for me?” and instead consider:

Simply showing up. Attend services regularly. Let the prayers of the Church slowly become your prayers.

Look for small, unnoticed ways to serve, rather than waiting to be served.

Choose to love these people around you — flawed, tired, imperfect — whether or not they immediately embrace you.

Stay for coffee hour. Liturgy is for worship, not conversation, but coffee hour is sometimes called the “liturgy after the liturgy.” It’s where we learn names, share burdens, and quietly become family. We aren’t saved alone; we’re saved together.

Keep a modest prayer rule outside of services, so your daily life is gently shaped by the same rhythms.

Give alms, even in small ways, until mercy becomes part of who you are.

And when it comes to fasting: don’t take this up on your own. Let a priest who knows you guide it. Orthodox fasting isn’t a private spiritual achievement; it’s medicine, wisely prescribed.


There’s also another paradox. Those eager to join quickly are often told by the Church to slow down — to wait, to be tested, to let their hearts deepen beyond first excitement. Meanwhile, those who simply keep coming, who live this life patiently even before formal entrance, often find the doors opening sooner than they expected. It’s not that the Church plays games or withholds grace. It’s that becoming part of this Body isn’t just a ceremony; it’s a transformation. Sometimes waiting is exactly what enlarges the soul to receive what’s being given.

And if you’re someone who can’t yet attend a parish — because of distance, health, family struggles, or anything else — keep praying. Keep struggling as best you can until you’re able to be incorporated into the Church’s life more fully. But never forget: Orthodoxy is not just a set of ideas to agree with. It is lived, embodied, experienced together in worship and community.

So don’t despise the waiting. Let it prepare you. Stay the course. Keep praying. Keep learning to love. In time, Orthodoxy isn’t just something you join — it’s something that quietly remakes you from within, if you’re willing to step aside and let Christ take His rightful place.

(If this oversteps the bounds of the forum, I apologize to the moderators. I know I’m inserting myself into conversations where I wasn’t directly invited — it’s just something I felt compelled to say out loud.)

I’m not a priest, nor clergy of any kind. I’m simply a middle-aged man who’s been Orthodox all my life. I serve on a parish council and have some lay responsibilities, but in the end I’m just another person, another man, still learning, still struggling to live the faith I claim to believe.

This isn’t the whole of Orthodoxy — far from it. It’s simply my attempt to help someone new find a steadier way to become part of parish life. I’d genuinely welcome others’ thoughts or additions, since there’s so much more that could be said.

1lwdxqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1lwdxqg/alkemia_reviews_of_19_scents_update/,Alkemia - reviews of 19 scents (update!),"As promised, updated reviews of my latest Alkemia haul (original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1lln582/long\_awaited\_alkemia\_order\_is\_finally\_here/).

I had an exceptionally high hit rate with this haul, and it’s only been 2 weeks since I got them, and several have already improved a lot from resting, so the ones I’ve rated lower may also just need more rest. If that’s the case I’ll edit this post with an update.

Also, I have another Alkemia order coming, from the July sale, in which I full-sized a couple of scents I sampled here, and also ordered another (much smaller this time) sample pack. I had an issue with the discounts not being applied after checkout, but Alkemia were quick to sort that out for me. Although I'm a little confused because all the scents I ordered showed up with discounts in the cart (they were all from either the discontinued or last chance sections) but they only refunded me for one of them. Has that happened to anyone else? Maybe the cart was mistakenly showing discounts on things it shouldn't? I haven't followed up with them about it because I get nervous about these things haha.

Anyway, on to the reviews...

**8.5/10 Midsummer alchemy (wild lilies, wisteria, honeysuckle, blossoming peach and orange trees, tulsi, bergamot, meadow grasses, and delicate jade green tea)**

This was incredibly faint at first but like most Alkemia scents I find that it's gotten stronger with time. It’s a warm, airy scent of lemon, soapy green tea, & sweet orange blossom. I’m not sure if I smell “meadow grasses” but the overall vibe it gives me is of a summer breeze carrying the scent of freshly cut grass. It’s not the kind of thing I normally wear but it’s beautiful.

**8.5/10 Tempest and a Teacup (Russian black tea, shattered bone china, the ozone of passing thunderclouds, and rain-damp suede.)**

This one doesn’t smell like any of the notes to me, but I like it. It’s a tea & citrus scent. The citric note most resembles lime to my nose, but also with something like lemongrass tea or lady grey - it’s not smoky or dark at all like one might expect from “Russian black tea”. Unfortunately I find Alkemia’s citrus can be a bit harsh and acidic at first, so I don’t love the opening. But the drydown is pretty, and becomes almost a bit white floral, maybe there’s hedione or something in there. Not quite my style but I still enjoy it, and it somehow reminds me of the lime/gardenia combo in Pineward’s Gelatto.

**7/10 Novella (delicately spiced Lavender de Provence, steaming Earl Gray tea, and tattered old paperback books.)**

This is similar to Tempest and a Teacup, but not as nice. Here the sharp acidic Alkemia citrus is so strong it almost smells like vinegar, though this harshness has lessened with more resting. There’s a slightly musty note in the background that reminds me of an antique store or charity shop; maybe that’s the “old paperback books”? It improves in the drydown, taking on more of a softly soapy floral quality. I think I now pick up on a faint lavender, but I didn’t when I first tried it 2 weeks ago. I’m also getting a faint tea note in the drydown but by that point it’s faded to a skin scent. I have a feeling this is one that’s going to keep getting better with age and maybe I will like it a lot more later on. As it is now, it’s not bad but it’s not great. 

As a side note, for the purposes of this review I dabbed a little on my wrist while still wearing a niche perfume from earlier, Cuir Tassili by Maison Rebatchi, and the two go SO WELL together!

**10/10 Cosmic Lotus (sacred incense, Egyptian musk, and fully blooming lotus flowers)**

This is gorgeous and unique! It’s very soapy, in that it literally has the same creamy, almost chalky clean texture to it that a solid hand soap does. Imagine a bar of soap scented with smoky incense and a sweet, almost fruity white floral (maybe gardenia. Yes I know it’s meant to be lotus but I’ve never smelled lotus IRL and it always comes across white floral to me in perfumes). The smoky + creamy combo is so unique and gorgeous. I full sized this one in the July sale because it has tragically been discontinued (I got one of the last samples in my previous order!)

**9/10 High Priest (Sticky dank-green resins mingle with deep, dark incense, black oud, guiac wood, gurjan balsam, and warmly animalistic black amber)**

This is probably worthy of a 10/10 tbh, I’m just being conservative with my rating because I did have an issue with this one turning ashy on me in the drydown (happens with a lot of Alkemia scents for some reason).

This opens up with a photorealistic peppery, earthy dank cannabis smell which quickly turns into a beautiful nag champa incense (a little too quickly for my liking; I would have liked the cannabis to stick around longer, and I actually tried layering some of Fyrinnae’s Convergence Zone on top to try and bring it out more since they share an earthy note - it did work quite well). As it dries down it becomes increasingly sweet, floral and soapy until it resembles a geranium/rose soap. I love the note of geranium, and I’ve been looking for an incense-forward cannabis scent, so this is just perfect for me. I found the projection pretty poor, but I haven’t tried it for a couple of weeks so I’m hoping it will have improved with resting.

**8.5/10 Uncharted (West Indian Bay rum, nutmeg, pomelo, crushed seashells, allspice berries, mamoncillo, Haitian vetiver, neroli flowers, pimento, sea moss, elemi balsam, coriander, mahogany wood, and salt soaked driftwood)**

This starts off with the sharp citric note I’ve been complaining about, but it quickly improves into a pretty classic ocean-scented soap/cologne scent. Nothing will ever top Fyrinnae’s Salish Sea for me in this genre, I’m afraid. But this is still nice. It has a bit of a fresh spicy aftershave feel from the bay rum and other spices. Not great performance though.

**7.5/10 Hippie Spirit (resinous head shop incenses, sexy skin musk, slightly dirty patchouli, groovy champa blossoms, and flowering cannabis)**

Big, dirty, natural patchouli! Leafy, kinda papery, smells like essential oils. And boy has it got staying power. This is one of those rare Alkemias with beast performance.

I don’t get much in the way of cannabis, sadly. I prefer the sillage, which is quite a sweet and powdery nag champa, to how it smells close up. Not my favorite of the nag champa category, but I’m just not that much of a fan of this kind of patchouli (I like my patchouli very dry and camphorous and not sweet at all).

**7.5 Lucky Money (The clean, metallic scent of newly minted money and the warm embrace of fresh-baked golden almond tea cookies evoke the happiness of receiving lucky red envelopes filled with good fortune.)**

Have you ever wanted to smell like stink bugs? Well, this is the perfume for you. It’s got that astringent bitter almond smell, along with a bready note. It literally does just smell like sour metal and almond biscuits, but the combo REALLY smells like stink bugs. The drydown is kinda incensey, but unfortunately develops a bit of that ashy note I’m cursed with. Interesting, but not as good as I’d hoped it would be. I need to give this one another go when it’s rested more.

**9/10 Sailing to Byzantium (dried ivy leaves, lotus root, and oakmoss; a nostalgic whisper of Provence lavender, tonka, and mist.)**

I love this one and have full-sized it in the July sale (why, oh why am I always cursed with falling in love with discontinued scents?!)

To me, this has the same fresh, juicy/watery note that’s in Moss Maiden, but while in Moss Maiden that smell is the ENTIRE scent, in Sailing to Byzantium it’s just one piece of a more complex composition. It’s very well blended and I can’t really pick out anything specific. There’s something floral, something almost a bit boozy, and maybe a faint, soft leather (suede?) in the background. It has a bit of an ancient feel, but it’s also very fresh.

**9/10 Book of Night (artemisia, oakmoss, blue juniper berries, black patchouli, sweet pipe tobacco, clove, and ritual incense resins curled up with the bedtime coziness of cashmere blanket and a steaming chai tea)**

Definitely chai tea! I don’t even like drinking chai - it’s too sweet for me - but I love the smell, and this is a really good rendition. I don’t think I’d enjoy wearing a scent that JUST smells like chai, though. What’s special about this one is this weird dichotomy between the sweet, warm spicy cardamom note of the chai tea, and what I’m assuming is Alkemia’s oakmoss note which I’m starting to identify in a number of scents (the same fresh juicy greenness in Moss Maiden and Sailing to Byzantium). On the one hand this is cosy and heavy and warm, but on the other hand there’s this fresh greenness that keeps it from becoming cloying, and it almost seems to switch from smelling like one to the other. It’s captivating.

**6/10 Cuir (single note)**

This is a really dark, smoky leather, and quite unlike the leather in other Alkemia scents. It has almost a woodfire smell and reminds me of winter days in the countryside where everyone has lit their fireplaces and the air is full of the smell of chimney smoke. It’s well done, but I’m not sure I’m going to be able to wear it - even though it’s not very strong, the scent profile is heavy and I find it a little sickening. I think I’d need to layer it with something bright and light to offset that.

**6/10 Tabac (single note)**

This was weirdly boozy and sweet on me, and smelled quite strongly of alcohol initially. Alkemia describes their tobacco as having caramel, whiskey, hay and vanilla notes. I definitely get the caramel and whiskey aspects, but I also weirdly feel like I smell coconut - there’s something in this that reminds me a lot of As Dark Things Are Meant To Be Loved. I don’t think this is my kind of tobacco, but I can see it maybe working layered with other, lighter scents though - which is after all how this is meant to be used.

**7.5/10 Encens (single note)**

Initially very strong, very soapy, intensely white floral and kinda fruity too, in a way that reminds me a bit of Cosmic Lotus - it has a similar smoky fruitiness. It’s actually not the most “nag champa"" nag champa I’ve smelled! High Priest and Hippie Spirit do it better. This is more of a fancy scented candle scent. Unfortunately in the drydown it becomes a bit “public bathroom soap”. Look, I’m never going to say no to a floral incense, but there are better renditions imo. 

**7/10 Athame (melting wax candles, santalum, aloeswood and other rare ritual incense woods, and the metallic spirit of a copper athame)**

I was excited for this one but all I really get is a sweet patchouli of the variety I really don’t enjoy. I can appreciate this is a good perfume in its own right, but unfortunately it reminds me of the scent profile of a couple of other perfumes that I always found a bit sickening (it’s the sandalwood and sweet patchouli combo). I think I’d like this a lot more if it was my first time smelling this scent profile, it’s just ruined for me by association. There’s a bit of a sour note in the opening that could be the copper note. Idk, this one just isn’t quite doing it for me.

**8/10 The Raven (ebony heartwood, black amber, piper nigrum, blackseed (habbatul barakah), black Bengal cardamon, black ink, nigella (black coriander), black iris, violet leaves, and leather)**

Herbal aniseed. I hate aniseed yet I somehow ended up quite enjoying this. It’s just objectively a very good perfume. The aniseed is so vivid it made my mouth feel funny the way chewing on fennel seeds does - that soapy feeling. And I would know because I do Ayurvedic cooking and eat a lot of fennel seed. I don’t get any of the other notes really, especially not the ink everyone talks about. It’s just photorealistic aniseed.

**10/10 Caveau des Innocents (tabac, dark coffee, piquant cloves, rum soaked pears, candied citron, dark caramel, and star anise bathed in intoxicating swirls of opoponax, labdanum, hashish, benzoin resinoid, vanilla incense, and guaiac wood)**

This one was such a shock! It just smells like caramel in the bottle, but when I put it on skin, it transformed into the most incredible sour, damp, musty old house/attic smell. It’s incredibly evocative and nostalgic for me, I’ve been in so many buildings that smell like this. From a distance the sillage is a vanillic tobacco, but when you get up closer it’s old books that have gone mouldy. I can imagine a lot of people thinking this is too atmospheric to wear as a perfume, but I have no shame and want to smell like mouldy books. That said, it might just be my skin chemistry because most people seem to think this is a nice gourmand, not a gothic haunted house scent?!

**10/10 Book of Shadows (heavy parchment paper, ancient iron oak gall ink, crumbling leather bindings, and wafts of rare incenses.)**

This is pure leather on me, I don’t get any of the other notes, but… it’s possibly the best leather I’ve ever smelled! Alkemia’s leathers seem to work really well on me. This is such a natural smelling, fresh but animalic leather. It doesn’t smell like shoe polish or chemicals (a problem I have with a lot of leather perfumes) but it also doesn’t just smell like raw animal hide. It’s perfumey and beautiful, softened with floral and fruity notes, a bit resinous and woody, but in a way that feels realistic. So hard to describe, ahhh, just get some and try it!

Weirdly, at close range, something about this reminds me of cats. Like being at a cat shelter. It must be the particular kind of animalic note. It’s warm like fur. I like this because I love cats, but cat haters beware, I guess.

**9/10 Shine Bright My Desire (golden amber, star jasmine, pink lotus, and orchid swathed in patchouli boudoir incense ignited by passionate kisses of pink pepper, Ceylon cinnamon, ginger zest, and bright verbena)**

A gorgeous classic floral musk with surprisingly good performance. Some people might call this scent profile “generic”. You can find a lot of popular women’s (and men’s) perfumes with this combo of amber, white musk and florals, especially from the 90s I think. But this is so well done and complex. I feel like I pick up on something slightly dill-sandalwoody, even though no sandalwood or cedarwood (another common culprit) is listed, but it’s very faint and doesn’t bother me.

**9/10 Viridis Arcanum (Turkish galbanum incense resin, Russian leather, and the fresh tips of coniferous Siberian Forest greens)**

Starts out very earthy and composty, but turns kinda sweet and resiny. The compost smell wears off quickly and then it’s just leather, and such a gorgeous leather with a kind of floral aspect, it reminds me of the leather in The Highwayman (which has really grown on me - it needed like 3 months resting though). I feel like there’s patchouli in here too. In the drydown, it mysteriously develops a sweet, jammy, raspberry sort of note. Someone told me this could be from the galbanum! That raspberry-leather combo isn’t quite my style but it’s objectively very good.

1lwdvpj,https://i.redd.it/le33hy0h22cf1.png,[Rum Review #159] Plantation Barbados 2011 Single Cask,"It's impressive how every year Planteray release different versions of this Single Cask series, which aren't just two or three or four rums. There are many. In 2017 (when they created the series) there were 10, in 2018 there were 11 different ones, in 2019 there were 12, in 2020 there were 11, in 2021 there were 12, in 2022 there were 15, in 2023 there were 15 more, and in 2024 13 different ones. We're talking more than 80 different products in a matter of seven years. I don't think anyone else has done that. Plus, they're all unique.

The fact that the labels mention most of what is bottled also amazes me, since many brands simply don't describe the raw material, fermentation, distillation, aging, blending, and bottling.

In the case of this Barbados 2011, it's a molasses rum produced by WIRD. The bottle label says it's fermented for three to four days, distilled in columns and a pot still in 2011, and aged in Barbados for 4 years. It's then transported to France, where it ages for 6 years in ex-Cognac barrels and then finished for 9 months in ex-Maury barrels, a French fortified wine. The final product is bottled at 48.2% alcohol, with a dosage of 4 grams of sweetener added per liter.

Made by: West Indies Rum Distillery / Planteray  
Name of the rum: Barbados 2011 Single Cask  
Brand: Plantation  
Origin: Barbados / France  
Age: 4 years + 6 years + 9 months  
Price: $85

**Nose:** I'm impressed that some of the aromas aren't exactly rum-like. While it retains the typical aromas of cherry and orange peel, as well as the oak and honey that I sense and appreciate in many rums, it's the aromas of grenadine, coffee, and fermented grapes found in a cognac and possibly a Maury that stand out the most.

**Palate:** The 48.2% alcohol content is barely noticeable on the palate. In fact, the liquid passes subtly through the mouth. The palate offers dried fruits, like almonds and hazelnuts, but also varied and wet wood notes, red fruits such as blackberries and raspberries, ginger, and a mild chocolate.

**Retrohale/Finish:** rich, and creamy, dark chocolate.

**Rating:** 8 on the t8ke 

**Conclusion:** Certainly impressive and an incredible product from Plantation/Planteray. It's yet another example of what can be achieved with the addition of a barrel to aging and the added dimension a finish brings to almost any spirit. There are many who dismiss this barrel variety as something that detracts from the original product, but I believe that anything that improves the product through natural methods will always enhance the experience, and that's what we do when we taste, experiment, and try.



English is not my first language and most of my reviews have been posted originally in Spanish, and later translated into English, so I apologize if they sometimes sound *mechanical*. On reddit I'm aiming to review mostly Venezuelan rums, but I post a bit of everything. You can check out the rest of my reviews (in Spanish) on [my blog](https://humoytabaco.com/), including rum, whisk(e)y, agave, gin and cigars. I also have an Instagram account [in Spanish](https://www.instagram.com/robleytabaco/) as well and another one [in English](https://www.instagram.com/oaknsmokes/), where I'll regularly update video reviews.
