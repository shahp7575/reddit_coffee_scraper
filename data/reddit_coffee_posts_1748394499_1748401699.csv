In highschool I was heavy due to being on steroids for asthma, starting to have my first bipolar manic and depressive episodes at 15 and comfort eating from being bullied.   

After I graduated is eventually came off the steroids and started losing weight.   I was still undiagnosed bipolar.   Wound up working graveyard shift drinking pots of coffee a day and taking about 8 over the counter diet pills a day, a long with hyper dieting and being in near constant manic or mixed episodes, even after I eventually got off grave yards.   That's when I was at my thinest as an adult size 36 waist medium shirt at 6 foot tall.

Then eventually wound up in hospital for a severe psychotic mixed (think mania and depression thrown in giant blinder) episode and finally diagnosed.   Long story short tye first combination of meds I was on especially my first anti psychotic made me balloon up to a size 46-48 and 4xl shirts in the span of two years before my psychiatrist had to take me off it because of the weight gain.   A second hospital stay few med changes later and I got down to a size 42 and 2-3xl depending on shirt.  

 I've gotten into hypomanic obsessive crash diets and gotten down at my lowest over a year ago to 268lbs to only crash out of that into a depression and gain it all back up to 294lbs 

I struggle I try to use my Fitbit as a tool but it can easily drive myself into a hypomanic episode (which has the risk of spiraling quickly and) if I get to hyper fixated on counting calories.

I also struggled with some of my meds making me feel hungry a lot.   And being in a food environment that can make it hard to eat the ""right"" things all the time.

I try to love my body, but I constantly see G/B influencers with much much thinner bodies then mine who simply aren't ""riped/fit"" have what might be called a dad bod in straight circles, get called tye nastiest things and have super derogatory things said about them and their bodies.   I've had such things said about me before because of profile pictures so now on Facebook my picture is my car and one Instagram and threads it's my dog that passed last year.

Had a stroke (medular rupture) in 2023. Since then I've been on a mix of medications to get my health under control, however i have some concerns they might be causing a cycle. I'm speaking with my doctor about it soon, but wanted to hear what others thought as well.

I'm on atorvostatin for cholesterol, and aspirin and carvedilol for blood pressure.
However, there's another factor. One of my blood tests showed elevated liver enzymes indicating fatty liver.
I've been dieting, trying to exercise more. I've even lost some weight lately. Was in the 240s, but weighed myself earlier and have gotten to around 228.
I've completely cut out sodas, and the most caffeine i have is 1 premier protein coffee drink a day. (Considering weening myself off those, though).
Despite all this, I'm still having trouble with occasional periods of hypertension. Sometimes lately 140/90, but earlier it was as high as 147/103. I understand that this may be a thing i must learn to live with, but i have questions. 

Recently, another blood test i had indicated high BUN levels which i read can be caused by liver problems. It was in the green, but literal right on the upper edge. I also read that high BUN and liver enzymes can contribute to hypertension.
And apparently statins, like atorvistatin, cause things like fatty liver inflammation.

So I'm concerned that the atorvostatin is contributing to my high BP in spite of the carvedilol.

I'm gonna ask my doctor for another blood test tomorrow to see if my cholesterol has improved, in which case maybe she'd be willing to rethink my meds. At the very least, maybe there's a less harsh statin (like rosuvastatin) she could switch me too instead.

But, I'm curious if anyone here has experience with this kinda thing. Maybe yall have suggestions i should bring to my doctor?",1,1748401251.0,hypertension,0,1.0,False

for the past few months, I’ve been kind of an asshole to people for literally no reason - just being really rude and short and impatient for no reason. It’s gotten so bad that even people asking simple questions like “where are you going?” make me so irritated that I end of being really rude and short with them. I am a nurse, so it’s really not okay for me to be like this. I thought maybe it’s been stress, so I started eating healthier and working out more consistently to see if that would help, started being more intentional with my free time to ensure I have self-care time, and have been super diligent with taking my meds, as they really help me manage stress. 

However, partly because I’ve been so diligent, I have been super inconsistent about eating. Some days, I forget to eat until 4 or 5 PM after only having a decaf coffee or tea that morning. It’s honestly because my meds cut my appetite so bad that I don’t feel hungry, so I forget to eat.

1kx6elv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1kx6elv/disturbing_dreams_where_others_are_affected_not_me/,"Disturbing Dreams Where Others Are Affected, Not Me","Hey everyone,
I’m someone who rarely dreams or at least never remembers them. But recently, I’ve had two vivid, unsettling dreams that are really messing with me. The weird part? I’m not the one being affected in them,it’s always someone else and I wake up feeling disturbed, even scared.


Dream 1 (yesterday night):
I dreamt I was sleeping beside my wife under a bedsheet. Suddenly, i wake up in dream as she was talking to something on the roof(on top of us). It felt eerie. In the dream, I scolded her, saying, “How many times have I told you not to take your face out of the bedsheet?” (as if in dream it felt like i already encountered the same situation)Then I pulled her back and covered her face again.
That’s when I woke up in real life. But I was so scared that I didn’t open my eyes at all. I just stayed frozen in place, pretending to sleep, until morning. It felt too real.


Dream 2 (last night):
I visited a married friend who lives with her husband and daughter. After I left, the dream followed her husband’s POV,he was making tea or coffee in the kitchen. My friend was changing clothes in another room, and suddenly started speaking in a weird, abnormal way as if she was talking to someone invisible. At first, the husband thought she was doing something random, but when it didn’t stop, he got concerned and went to check.
Right as he knocked on the door, I woke up again, feeling uneasy.


Both times, I’m not the one being “attacked” or affected directly, but I feel the fear deeply. I also always wake up with this weird sense of dread, like something spiritual or unknown is lingering.

I don’t know if these dreams mean something, or if my brain is just overactive. But I’ve never had dreams like this before, and now I’m anxious and sleeping badly.


Has anyone else experienced dreams like this? Where others are affected but you’re just watching? Could this be symbolic, spiritual, or psychological? Any help or insight would be really appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

I am taking a roasting course that Scott Rao helped with, and today he went over three main areas of defect and how to manage them. Details outlined below.

# BAKED

* This is typically when ROR drops rapidly after first crack and then flattens or begins to rise
* This is due to a sudden energy absorption and the rapid release of moisture and CO2, which dampens the internal rise of temperature
* Too low power and too long Maillard phase can contribute
* Decreases sweetness, roundness and juiciness
* As coffee cools the coffee will taste more hollow and flat
* To avoid, monitor the temperature and momentum going into first crack and maintain or slightly increase power until first crack is well underway to avoid large dip

# UNDERDEVELOPED

* This is when the center of the beans is not developed fully
* This is due to ending development after first crack too soon, too low heat (especially during Maillard phase), or too much airflow early on (mainly in drum roasters)
* This will add a grass, vegetal, woody, or peanut butter flavor
* Lacks sweetness, weak body, and sometimes tastes brothy
* To avoid, ensure enough time for coffee to develop after first crack, increase heat during Maillard phase if needed, watch for even bean color

# FLICKED

* This is when the ROR rises or accelerates rapidly towards the end of the roast, typically after the ROR crashes or stalls
* This can happen when too much heat is applied near the end of a roast or dropping the heat at an appropriate time during/after first crack is delayed
* The coffee will taste more roasted than it should for the level of development it is at, and flavors can be burnt or muted
* To avoid, you may need to reduce heat just enough 15-30 seconds prior to first crack, do not try to stretch development by re-introducing heat late in the roast, and increase the fan and airflow after first crack to off-set tendency to flick by pulling heat off the beans
* Do not drop heat too much when doing this or you will cause the ROR to crash and bake the coffee",1,1748400838.0,FreshroastSR800,0,1.0,False

25 weeks; failed 1 hr at 179 😬 then passed my 3 hour (fasting was 94, cut off was 95),1 hr was high rest within limits. Then had severe hypoglycemia after (in the 40s!)

Spoke with my OB and agreed to start texting my glucose for a week around 28 weeks to see how I was doing to maybe rule me back in for GD. I applied a freestyle CGM I had left over to watch my glucose in response to what I’m eating closely. 

Here’s today’s for example:
Fasting 103 

Had a drinkable yogurt and coffee, spiked up to highest 140 but was at 123 at 1 hr post 

Lunch was cheese quesadilla with a normal Dr Pepper, spiked up to 140s again but was 118 at 1 hr post 

Currently eating dinner but was hypoglycemic down to 65 before started eating. 

My questions: 
If I wasn’t diabetic, wouldn’t my glucose not spike up after a meal at all? 

What time am I suppose to take my fasting? I looked at my freestyle app as soon as I opened my eyes and was in the 80s, got dressed brushed my teeth and checked it and it was 100, my finger poke was 103. Am I dumping glucose in the AM? 

If just my fasting are high do I have GD? How can I drink a regular soda and not be in the 200s, or is it because I’m still on the earlier side of my pregnancy?

So on another thread a while back, I did share that my wedding gown was purchased by JNMIL and I had complex feelings of sadness over it. It’s a beautiful ballgown dress with hints of blush between the layers and it was perfect for me. I loved it, but always felt odd and even uncomfortable at the fact that it wasn’t truly my dress, but something someone who disliked me purchased to make themselves look good to others. That being said, every now and then I would feel sad that I didn’t have my dress with me at home since we left it at the ILs, and that nobody had reached out to get us to pick up the dress. I know it was stupid of me to leave it there and forget about it for a while, though the timeline between the wedding and the big fallout was rather short; as to say, I didn’t really have much of a chance to pick it up once the bad blood got too bad. In my mind back then, decorum was still in the equation between both parties, and I never expected something like this to happen, so picking it up wasn’t a thing I felt hurried on. Well..

Today JNMIL texts DH asking what she should do with my dress and his tuxedo. They have a guest coming over for JNMIL’s birthday soon and they want to make room for their belongings. Which is fair, of course, though the dress and tux don’t take much room in their rather large home in my opinion. The text didn’t acknowledge the tension or the fact that their last talk devolved into her calling us names, but just a “Hi DH, how have you been?” Along with the dress thing. DH approached me about it with a “I’d like to talk to you about something and get your input”, then gave me the option to back out if I wanted to. When he said it was about my dress, I knew it was a convo I had to speak to him about.

Well, the end result is that while I liked my dress a lot, loved it, even, whenever I see pictures of it or anything about it, all the gross feelings and negative emotions come bubbling back up. This dress was purchased by the biggest hater of my marriage, now (i supposed) being used as an item to get her son to visit her on or around her birthday, just like various other attempts where she’d offer him coffee makers or his mail to get him to go there. This woman doesn’t acknowledge anything and would rather lord over items in hopes DH sees her. And he was about to do it until I suggested he ask his FM sister deliver it to us since JNMIL made her the official messenger between both parties. But once I reflected on how much grief this dress would give me, and the icky feeling of strings attached this dress has, I decided to let the dress go. 

What matters to me more than material possessions is my marriage. I can buy a dress at any time. 

I know I was really foolish for leaving my dress with them. I won’t live that down. But even before the big fight, I already felt complicated about the dress. So I think I did right by myself. DH sent her a text that was unusually assertive to her, which I supported, saying: “You’re the one who purchased it, it’s up to you on whether or not you toss it.” All she responded was “Wow. Ok.”

Saturday April 6, 1968","This one day entry of Wes Hildreth's diary is so well written and contains so much history, I hope you humor me in sharing this. Wes and Jack were hiking from Supai Village in Havasu Canyon to the Hopi Salt Trail that April. They had intended to hike to Nankoweap and exit Saddle Mountain but the water in the river was too cold. Hope you enjoy this read.

Saturday 6 April \[1968\] 

Used half the 41/2 qts. we had each filled at Boucher Creek, so our loads were as light today as at any point on the trip - no more than 30 lbs. on my back. Dawn was pretty - wild clouds moving fast and solar rays piercing the mist upriver. Ra, Set, Cheops, etc. are very imposing across the gorge. I’ll explore them someday. Early, 2 jets roared down the canyon no higher than the middle Redwall - lowest we’ve seen this trip. Fairly easy going (after initial gullies) got us to Hermit Camp in 2 hours. Approaching, I jerked up to see 12 boy scouts leaving the camp ½ mile across the canyon - first humans we’d seen in 15 days - all lined up and trooping off like sheep. Old fences of chicken wire remain about ½ mile along the Tonto each way from Hermit, no doubt to restrain pack animals in the days this was a tourist center. I later found that antelope were kept here as a trial herd in the 1920s - segregated from the burro range, which was badly overgrazed. Several old beds at Hermit Camp, lower part, and many foundations on the grassy slope above. Found a can of beans which we ravenously devoured, having skimped on a Cream of Wheat breakfast. Quite a fascinating spot, with many trails and built-up rock walls leading down to water in the ravines, which were flowing weIl. A much more scenic spot than Phantom, and with easy river access. Too bad they didn’t keep this one instead - but the cross canyon trail route was no doubt the deciding factor. Heading out onto the Tonto again, just as we passed the gate in the fence beyond the trail jct. to Cathedral Stairs, we were caught by a sharp 15-minute rain which soaked us thru. Drying out was almost as fast, so when rain came again in Salt Crk we had forgotten we were once wet. Moving faster now than at any time since meeting Jack at G.T. Spring, we roared around the Monument Creek, counting on a late afternoon milkshake! The Monument itself was an impressive Tapeats obelisk 200’ high on a pink granite base. And old NPS tellephone sign, wire, beds and the normal campsite debris of tea pots and pitchers made an interesting scene. Both this and Salt Crk. had old green + white NPS enamel signs announcing themselves. Hermit had a couple plus a trail jct. sign and a rusty old thing saying Tonto Trail. Little burro evidence out here now, but a fair number of hikers make this the best trail I’ve seen since Supai. Saw no water at Cedar Spring but all the creeks were running, even Horn a trickle - very wet weather here lately.

Finally caught the boy scouts, sitting down to lunch at the head of Salt Creek just as it began to rain again. They had made good time for 14-year-olds - we gained barely 45 minutes on them in almost 4 hours. Initially apprehensive at our wild appearances, they soon warmed up and took a real interest in our journey. All were GC residents - either NPS or Fred Harvey families. We saw them twice the next day in Babbitts and at the Ranger Station. Good kids - wish more would get out and about. One had even read Colin’s book and knew approximately what we were doing. The adult leader, an NPS employee (driver?) named Clyde Fauley, was pleasant but mildly embarrassed at contact with such outlandish creatures.

We really are quite astonishing to behold - wretched and tattered ragamuffins. The kids gave us each an excess can of tuna and some bread, which probably in the long run supplied the energy to make it to Babbitts by closing time. Rounding Horn Creek, we had a good view of the mine tower on the rim and the telephone line \[Ed note: High Tension line\] swinging free nearly 1,500’ down and out from the Redwall, connecting to poles on the Tonto which round the Battleship to Indian Gardens, safely out ofsight of tourist eyes. Went out to the point E. of Horn rapid, one of the worst on the river, for the last pixs for Marston this week.

Jack went rapidly ahead and I didn’t catch him until the base of the Redwall above Indian Gardens. In my haste, I took on no water there, and Jack soon consumed my half-quart as well as a quart of his own in the ascent. He did well but it really hurt - such an effort should round out what is becoming excellent physical condition. I bet he’s lost 15 lbs. and doubled his endurance. All it takes is regularity. With plenty of encouragement and time predicting I coaxed him on schedule past each 1/2 mile post, feeding him snow and ice from shady spots and my last can of dried beef. An additional boon was finding a full pack of lifesavers on the trail and two elephant legs from an otherwise empty box of Animal Crackers.

The burro dung trail ice may have been responsible for the poor and very gaseous condition of my intestines for the next 24 hours. Far more gaseous than usual - and this has been a loudly crepidatory journey. We rimmed out at 5:45, having left I. Gdns. Rest House at 3:37 - good time - and stormed into Babbitts at 5:55 only to find a sign on the door that it will also be open Sunday (tomorrow) for the first time this year! As we once said, it’s an ironic trip.

No one should ever shop for 5 future days on the trail half-overcome with thirst and fatigue from charging full blast out of the G.C. I bought three giant Hershey’s, a quart of orange juice, four boxes of cookies, and a six pack of beer before settling down to things I could realistically carry in a pack. Jack drank a quart of milk while pushing a shopping cart up a single aisle - abandoned the carton amidst soup cans. Worst irony is the Soda Fountain and Snack Bar were both closed from 5 PM, so no milkshake until tomorrow.

We sat on the floor of the empty Post Office drinking beer and reading letters from our sweet faraway wives. One lady peeked in but bolted, afraid to enter an empty room with such sprawling riff-raff. Took the Ranger Station by storm - even Lloyd Hoener was impressed with how tough we looked and even possibly with the exploit itself. Ken Hulick is again down at Phantom, but a note said our gear is on his desk. Signed in and out for the next lap making it Little Colorado instead of Nankoweap. Too cold in that river!

Then staggered with packs and grocery bags to the B.A. Lodge where we were lucky enough to get a room, again ironically in Powell Lodge. Took a long hot beautiful bath while Jack showered, and felt much better, except for the footsoreness. While sorting food and gear, I felt my Achilles tendon begin tightening for the first time on the trip. It must be a function of hard extended uphill work. Threw away one pair of socks and washed the rest of my cloths in the bath tub.

Appeared clean but wild in the dining room for a 9 PM dinner of hamburger steak, lemons, much bread, onions, soup and salad, tea + coffee and a relish plate. All the bus boys and girls really dug us, served us many little extras, and solicited pot and peyote! We really look “Far Out.” Phoned Di and Nancy at Fulton’s after dinner - really good to talk to my sweetie pie - she sounded enthusiastic and happy if just a bit lonely, but not martyred: a good sport and gutsy. Made all A’s and B’s too! Home in two weeks for all too brief an interlude before flying to Juneau.

Got a card from Colin \[Fletcher\] wishing me that I find all that I am after - which suggests a recurrent, interesting, but I think unanswerable, question. Stayed up in bed ridiculously late, writing Nance, Marston, Butchart, Jim and Mother. Even at 3 AM I couldn’t sleep - coffee at dinner? Too many thoughts and details to attend to? Too hot in the room? Or just too radical a change in environment? It actually seems strange to see all these irrelevant people.

Worst irony here was emerging from the trailhead to see several couples in tuxedos and full length gowns going to the N.A.U. spring prom. Incredible. Ludicrous. Infinite juxtaposition. Two kids on the trail whom I overtook at Kolb studio said you are not going to pass us now, but looked blank when I said I didn’t need to. Scouts going down looked similarly blank when the reply to their question of how long I’d been down was 15 days. No, not the Kaibib Trail, the Topacoba Trail. Supai. Nobody. 15 days. Disbelief. Blank.

In the B.A. lodge, a couple realized we haven’t seen any news in some time and effervesced with the astonishing stories of LBJ’s demurrer, peace talk possibilities, and above all the King assassination. There was no better man in America. I’d seen the NPS flag at half-staff - Wayne Cone passed through my mind and Smirkingly Elbie, but in my stupor I had forgotten to ask at the Ranger Station. What a world to return to - nearly three weeks without news of one of the eventful periods in recent years. Wilderness or the revolution? On such a note I washed the world’s filthiest T-shirt, went to bed, and ended the first stage of my journey.

1kx63mh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGaybrosOver30/comments/1kx63mh/am_i_overreacting/,Am I overreacting?,"\[TL;DR\]: My partner claims that he doesn't feel welcome at Leather events because of his fetish (one that we both share and had before we got together). But, he insists on coming to events because he also claims that he ""likes them"" and ""is interested"".

So, my partner and I are coming upon 3 years and it hasn't exactly been easy so far. I love him, but sometimes I wonder if the meaning of that word is being stretched to its end in this situation. We are in an age-gap relationship, I'm 33. (I'll call him 'C') C is 57. Before you make any assumptions, let me clear some things up.

1. I've been in the gay community longer than him. He says that he was taken advantage of and bullied by the bitchy gays when he was out in the 80's, and coupled with the AIDS epidemic he just left the community and sought cis community and was in long-term gay relationships. 8-12 years on average.
2. I'm a member of the Leather community. I am polyamorous, and made it clear I was not going to change that at all. I do not have any other committed partners than him, and I do have a few intimate friends and lovers, but I've made it clear that I do not want to build a life with them. Some of them have other primary partners, are solo-poly, etc.

When we have attended Leather events he complains that they're ""all about sex"" and that nobody wants to talk to him because he ""isn't as attractive as me"".

But, he always gets nervous beforehand, and doesn't bring the open attitude and kind confidence that I fell in love with. And then complains that nobody wants to talk with him. We both have a foot fetish, but I am more open about it. He is very secretive about it but seems upset with the community because opportunities to engage in that fetish aren't WIDELY advertised. But, I tell him that I get invited to foot-fetish events all the time, because I'm willing to talk about it and create the experience I want to have instead of needing someone else to bring it to me.

This community has been a part of my life for a long time and I have friends here (more non-sexual than sexual) but C and I often get into conflicts around these events, but he insists on going.

This past weekend we went to a local Burning Man event (PDF) and he was so happy that he made friends that he, ""feels like will go to hang out and get a coffee and be responsive."" And said, ""I definitely feel more comfortable here than at Leather events"". But, when I brought up the fact that he had a completely different attitude at PDF than he brings to leather events - he wouldn't acknowledge it and still asserted that he wants to attend Leather events.

Am I overreacting in considering just telling him that after our planned Leather events for this year, I don't want him to come along anymore?",1,1748399975.0,AskGaybrosOver30,4,0.6,False

 I don't really think that there is a good way to start my story, so I'm going to begin with the part that really caused this. I'm an adult in my twenties who, like many young adults, feels like my life doesn't have any purpose. Ever since I graduated high school, I have been roaming around North America, trying to find a place to call home-to find people to call home.
  My family is great, if a bit strange, but they weren't the type of family I wanted to have for my own. I wanted to find like-minded friends and maybe even someone to fall in love with, to make our own little family. I moved from state to state, hoping that the next place would have what I was looking for, but I was never so lucky.



Part one: I need a break


    I had just moved into my new apartment in Cedar Hollow, Maine-a place so obscure I wasn’t even sure I’d heard of it before. But I needed somewhere to stay, and this cheap Craigslist find would have to do. It wasn’t the worst place I’d lived, but it was far from anything to brag about.

  Nearby, I landed a job at a small company called “Cryp-tee-d Co.”, which made quirky T-shirts featuring cryptids-those mysterious creatures from folklore. The shirts were amusing but hardly destined for big sales outside Maine. Little did I know, this job would mark the start of the darkest chapter of my life.

  At first, everything seemed normal. The company had a handful of long-time employees, and there was a steady flow of people coming and going. Over the first year, I met someone special, and by the end of that year, we decided to start dating.

  We had fun going on little dates, trying out odd restaurants, and venting about the ridiculous shirts we made-shirts no one ever seemed to wear. We dreamed of escaping the job, especially since our boss was a verbally abusive nightmare, constantly yelling about how we failed to capture the ""essence"" of cryptids in our designs.

  Both severely underpaid, we decided to move in together to split rent. That’s when things started to unravel.

  Spending every moment together should have been a blessing, but my old habits of self-sabotage crept in. Growing up in a strange family, I struggled with genuine affection. I thought gifts were the way to show love, but I forgot to be emotionally present. My girlfriend often told me this, but instead of opening up, I shut down and isolated her.

  Over two years, things worsened until she packed up and left. I never knew where she went. Attempts to reach her failed-she likely blocked me. I sank into a pit of despair that bled into my work, and the quality of my shirts plummeted.

  My boss’s anger grew with every recycled or worse design I submitted. Depression took hold. My last friend from high school grew distant, caught up in his own life. I started calling out of work, using family emergencies as excuses to take time off, but I never visited them. I feared their judgment and rejection.

  I stayed home, draining my savings, playing video games on my oblivious neighbor’s open Wi-Fi. My apartment was cold and lonely, even with the heat on. I never slept in the bedroom anymore-I wanted my things to still smell like her. Instead, I crashed on the awful couch she hated but I had insisted on keeping. It was a cruel joke how right she’d been about its discomfort.

  Things got so bleak I began searching for an escape-whether through drugs or something darker. One night, before sleep, I prayed to any god that might listen. I just needed a break.


Part 2: Learning to dream

  I started spending more and more time online, searching for ways to help myself. I tried everything-from psychedelic drugs to one of those online therapy apps. Honestly, those apps almost did more harm than good. The people never seemed all that professional, and after a few sessions, I felt even worse. One night, after another disappointing therapy call, I lay in bed feeling like I’d nearly run out of options. That’s when a memory from my school days floated up: lucid dreaming. If you don’t know what that is, it’s when you become aware in your dream and can control everything about it. You could be a knight in a castle, a hero fighting Godzilla, or even create your own Garden of Eden. I made a mental note to call out of work the next day and dedicate myself to learning about lucid dreaming. As I drifted off to sleep, the last thing I remember was the faint sound of sorrowful laughter, then darkness.

  I was never one to sleep long, so a few hours later I woke up and decided to get coffee to jumpstart my research. I never really believed coffee made me more productive, but with enough sugar, at least I’d be wired enough to keep searching for answers. On my way home, I called my boss to say I was feeling sick and would be bedridden all day. As fate would have it, I was standing at a red light when my boss pulled up right beside me. We made eye contact-me on the phone, him in his car. He rolled down his window and yelled through both the phone and the open window that I’d better see him in his office as soon as I got to work, or I’d be fired. Frustrated with my own stupidity, I spiked my half-finished coffee onto the sidewalk, rushed home, changed into my work clothes, and headed in.

  When I got to my boss’s office, I knocked on the door. No answer. I waited, knocked again, still nothing. Slowly, I pushed the door open. He was sitting with his back to me, staring out the window. My heart sank-this was exactly how movies showed someone right before they were found dead. Was I about to be framed? Would I go to jail for something I didn’t do? Was today the end of my free life?

  I skirted around the edge of the room, careful not to touch anything. I didn’t want to leave any evidence behind. When I finally saw his face, I let out a breath I didn’t know I’d been holding. He wasn’t dead. But he wasn’t right, either. He sat there, unblinking, tears rolling down his cheeks, a huge smile plastered on his face. A strange, ominous laugh leaked out of him. As soon as I moved into his peripheral vision, he snapped back to his usual angry self. He barked at me for not knocking, told me to sit down, and when I just stood there, stunned, he grew red in the face and demanded I sit immediately. I backed around his desk and sat, never taking my eyes off him, wondering if I’d imagined the whole thing.

  The conversation went about as well as I’d expected. He told me I was on my final strike. My shirt designs were slipping in quality, I’d been calling out too often, and I’d lied to him that very morning. If I didn’t shape up, I’d be out of a job. The whole time he yelled, tears kept streaming down his face, as if he didn’t even notice. I thought to myself that this might be the most uncomfortable situation I’d ever experienced.

  After that strange encounter, I went back to work and actually managed to come up with a few decent shirt ideas. The weirdness of the morning seemed to spark my creativity. When the day was over, I hurried home, eager to put the whole ordeal behind me. I didn’t have to work the next day, so I could stay up as late as I wanted researching lucid dreaming. Everything I read said I needed to get into a meditative state before dreaming. That was going to be tough, but I was determined. I sat on my uncomfortable couch, put on relaxing music, closed my eyes, and tried to meditate. I had no idea what I was doing, and before long, I just fell asleep without any results.

  Over the next week, I scoured YouTube for meditation guides and found a ton of options. But I didn’t pay for ad-free content, so every time I started to relax, a loud ad would jolt me out of it. I realized I’d need to make more money if I wanted to meditate without interruptions. So, I started showing up to work more often, and my boss seemed to ease up on me.

  After that day in my boss’s office, nothing weird happened between us, and I didn’t notice anything strange with anyone else. Gradually, I forgot about it. By the end of the month, I’d upgraded my streaming services so I could meditate without ads. I kept practicing, and little by little, my sleep improved.

  A week into my new routine, my dreams started to return. At first, they were just scattered fragments-disjointed ideas and themes-but it was better than nothing. I couldn’t remember them clearly, but just knowing I’d dreamed at all felt like progress. My life began to take a turn for the better. It’s amazing what a full eight hours of sleep can do, even if the motivation is just to avoid getting fired.

  A month in, I noticed the first signs of being able to control my dreams. I could make things happen on purpose and remember them when I woke up. It felt like directing a movie, though I was a pretty bad director. I could fly around the world, but since I’d never left the United States, my world was basically just a giant globe. I jumped off the Empire State Building and landed unharmed, like in that scene from The Matrix. I knew that with more practice, I could become a true lucid dreamer.

  The first time I had a dream where I was fully in control was incredible. I created a world of endless meadows and wildflowers, the sun shining bright and warm. I wandered through fields, feeling the grass brush against my legs, smelling the flowers. I set up a picnic and ate my favorite foods, which tasted better than anything I’d had in years. It was as if someone had turned up the color saturation in my life. For the first time in a long time, I felt okay. After eating, I wandered further, until I reached the edge of a dense, mysterious forest. It was thick but somehow inviting. I heard a stream trickling just beyond the trees. I tried to will the forest away, to return to the meadows, but nothing changed. Just as I gathered the courage to step into the forest, my alarm went off, pulling me back to reality. I decided that if I ever found myself at the edge of that forest again, I wouldn’t hesitate-I’d step in and explore the unknown corners of my dream.



Part 3:Hopeless Romantic 

  Something about the edge of that forest must have really messed with my subconscious, because after that dream, I couldn’t control my dreamscapes the way I had before. It was as if the border of that imagined woodland had erected a barrier in my mind, keeping me from returning to that place of wonder and possibility. Frustrated, I decided it was time to take a break from chasing dreams and focus on real life for a while.

  I figured some fresh air might do me good, so I actually applied for vacation time-legitimately, for once-and got it approved. I packed a bag, got in my car, and drove west for a couple of hours until I reached a quaint little town nestled beside a sparkling lake. The place felt like a secret, a pocket of peace tucked away from the world, and I decided I’d spend at least one night there.

  Wandering the town’s winding streets, I stumbled upon a shop that stood out from its sleepy surroundings: “Conspira-See,” the sign read, adorned with a psychedelic eye. The place looked so out of place, I couldn’t resist stepping inside. Given my own line of work, I was curious to see if the people here were as odd as the ones back home.

  Inside, the store was a treasure trove of the bizarre and the old-books that looked a century past, shelves crowded with objects I couldn’t even begin to name. There were cryptid references everywhere, familiar and strange all at once. But the oddest thing by far was the complete absence of a shopkeeper. I waited at the counter, called out, and heard nothing but the creak of old wood. Suddenly, a shuffling noise behind me made my skin prickle. I spun around, heart pounding.

  Standing just two paces away was what I thought was a statue of Mothman, looming over five feet tall. But then it moved-a young woman, dressed in a full Mothman costume, grinning at me with the satisfaction of a prank well played. She slipped out of the costume, laughter bubbling up as she saw how thoroughly she’d startled me.

  She was strikingly beautiful, with dark hair cascading down her back and eyes that sparkled with mischief. Her skin glowed with a warm, sun-kissed hue, and her smile-crooked, goofy, utterly endearing-caught me completely off guard. She moved with a charming clumsiness, and her voice, soft and lilting with an Irish accent, made me feel instantly at ease. Her name was Helena, and in that moment, I felt a strange, immediate connection.

  We chatted for a while, and she managed to convince me to buy a couple of odd trinkets. When I asked for her number, she laughed-a laugh that sounded oddly familiar, joyful but somehow forced at first, before settling into something more genuine. I brushed it off as my imagination, chalking it up to not having heard real laughter in too long.

  I left town the next day with a lighter heart and Helena’s number saved in my phone. We started texting, and I was surprised by how easy it was to talk to her. She told me about her love for painting and comics, and her enthusiasm made me realize I needed a hobby of my own-something more than just video games and meditation. I wanted to be a part of the world again, if only to have more to share with her.

  When she asked what I did for fun, I awkwardly tried to explain lucid dreaming. To my relief, she already knew all about it-more than I did, actually, which made sense given her job in that shop of curiosities.

  One evening, she suggested we talk on the phone. The thought gave me butterflies, and I dialed her number right away. As the phone rang, something strange happened: a raspy, ancient voice seemed to answer, whispering the word, “Holi’andr.” The name made me smile involuntarily, filling me with a sudden, inexplicable joy so intense that a tear rolled down my cheek. Then, just as quickly, the sensation faded, and Helena answered, her voice grounding me in reality. Relief and disappointment mingled inside me-I was happy, but a little wistful that I couldn’t always feel that euphoric.

  We talked late into the night, until I drifted off to sleep with the phone still pressed to my ear. It was the first time I’d slept in my own bed since my ex had left, and it felt like a turning point-a step forward into something new.

  The next morning, I woke up energized. At work, my creativity soared-I designed shirts better than I ever had, good enough that my boss actually complimented me for the first time. It was so out of character that I texted Helena about it right away. She replied with a joke about spreading positivity, and I couldn’t help but smile.

  That afternoon, I went on a cleaning spree at home, clearing out old junk and making space for something better. I scheduled an appointment to finally get my own internet connection, and even went grocery shopping instead of ordering in. Sitting in my freshly cleaned house, I realized how much lighter everything felt-the oppressive shadow of my past was finally gone.

  That night, I played some games and then settled in for meditation. For the second time ever, I slipped into a dream where I had full control. I couldn’t help but wonder if it was Helena’s presence in my life that made the difference. Maybe, just maybe, I was starting to dream again-both asleep and awake.


If you read this far, thank you so much. This is the first story that I'm ever working on so it's fairly rougher in the edges but I was going for a spin on cosmic horror: cosmic bliss. I felt like I haven't seen too much of it so I tried to write the story that I would like to read.

1kx5zo3,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kx5zo3/i_think_i_just_lost_my_closest_friend_because/,I think I just lost my closest friend because they're getting married,"I'm an openly gay man, and a couple hours ago she confirmed she'd be getting married (she's Muslim). About a month ago she mentioned that her mom wanted to introduce her to a guy to try and arrange for their marriage, and i thought it would end up like every other guy she was introduced to: uninterested. she even told me a few months back that she was frustrated with her mom trying to set her up since she was trying to focus on her career right now. last week, she asked me to get coffee with her, and since we hadn't been talking much since she had said she was busy, i gave her some space. we were only able to talk for about an hour before she had to go, but during that conversation she told me she's certain about marrying this guy, and that she this hangout was probably going to be the last. i was confused and asked her how come. she said she wanted to respect her fiance and not talk to other men just like he was expected to not talk to other women. i told her that made sense for the most part, but i didnt really know if that applied to me or not since, I'M GAY. i suggested next time we hung out, she could bring other friends along, or even just her new husband if it made her feel more comfortable. i even joked she's be an auntie soon enough and she could throw parties where we could spend time together. she didn't seem that amused at that, and just laughed awkwardly and avoided eye contact. we talked about other things until it was time to go. the conversation left me feeling uneasy, and i asked her for a hug before she left, and we hugged. we even called a bit while we both drove home, and she brought up how she was nervous about how to approach people who she thought were going to be upset that she may not be able to spend time with anymore, and i told her that her real friends would be there alongside her even if it wasn't as often as it previously was. maybe i'm just stupid, but i didnt really think she was talking about me.

  
fast forward a week later, and i asked her when we were going to go to the park for a walk, since it was something i'd been wanting to do with her for a while and she'd mentioned it while getting coffee. she didn't respond for a few days, up until a couple hours ago. she said that she was confirmed getting married, that she was moving into a new chapter of her life, that ""out of respect"" she was going to stop sharing her location with me, and that she wasn't going to make plans with me anymore. 

  
i don't even know how to process this right now. one of the few people who's stuck with me through thick and thin, who've i've supported and who's supported me, is pulling away. just like that. i don't know whether to feel betrayed or to mourn. i feel so hurt, and yet i can't get myself to cry. i even tried to do some research on how these practices work for Muslims, and i'm even more heartbroken after reading that it's not considered proper/appropriate for men and women to be friends, especially after marriage. i've lost so many friends in the recent past, and just like that i've lost the one i think i cared about the most. i don't even know if i should text/call her and ask her outright what i need to do to be able to stay in her life, or if it's just already over and she's trying to let me down easy. just last month we were talking about maybe going on a trip, and i was even planning to watch Wicked Part 2 with her when it gets released since we'd seen the first part together in theaters. at the beginning of this year, we celebrated her passing her certification exam for her job by getting hotpot (and yes it was halal), and now... nothing. i'm just sitting here contemplating whether to rip down her letters she'd sent me while i was in college from my wall and delete her off of everything, or get myself a drink, lay on the ground, and pretend this isn't real. our last hangout was only an hour, and it was spent with her trying to let me down easy about how we weren't probably weren't going to be friends anymore. why couldnt we at least have gone to the park, somewhere scenic for our last hangout? 



I feel so stupid. i thought we'd be friends forever. we shared so many of the same struggles, so many of the same hopes and dreams. i've been to her house multiple times before too, and her family and siblings have always seemed cool with me (and yes they all knew i was gay). i guess i thought maybe i'd be an exception to the rule, that i wouldn't be considered a threat, especially since she's never going to be in my dating pool. i now wonder if i was just being used until she found a husband, and now that she has, i'm just being discarded. it's so unfair. i wish i was a girl right now, just so we could continue making happy memories. i hate this :(",2,1748399649.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1kx5z9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1kx5z9j/divorcing_my_husband_of_six_years_he_ignored_my/,Divorcing my husband of ~six years. He ignored my express / clear ‘NO’ for intimacy six months ago among other things I cannot get over.,"My husband and I met around 2014. It was pretty intense in the beginning. He asked me to move in within a few months and showed me affection I never experienced before. I was in my 20s then, much less inclined to listen to my gut. Yet, my gut was.  there. It was rumbling; there were things I ignored. 

When we got married six years ago, he expressed strong desires to move to a state far away where we had no friends/family and he had no job prospects or a clear concise plan for us to move. He hated life where we lived; the culture; the people; his job; everything. He complained about it every single day. Drunk and smoke a lot. Moving became a point of contention. He wanted a change of lifestyle to live near the wilderness and I loved my job and my life where we met. Two years later, I ended up getting pregnant. My husband really really started putting the pressure on me to move to this fairly remote state/area. It was intense, every day 2 x a day, he would ask. I would express my same reservations. I felt so alone, yet tried to support his many trips there during my pregnancy and throughout our marriage. It would get ugly and he would repeatedly call me selfish and threaten to leave. He had multiple angry outbursts throughout. 

One day after our child was born, a little over a year ago now, he told me to move out of “his” house so he could sell the house and move. I was scared and nervous but I started to look for houses closer to my family, where our child and I would have support. However, he continued to try to pressure me to move with him, he made threats of self harm, called me names, etc. We ended up trying counseling and when he didn’t like what he was hearing, he quit in anger and committed to moving. I continued my efforts to move closer to my family. He would not go on his own  though. 

About a year ago now, he ended up relocating closer to my family with me. Yet, his misery continued. He still complained. He still wanted to move and repeatedly made threats to leave. I felt bad and guilty; my path and vision was not aligned perhaps his but I asked him to please leave, that I would not hold hard feelings and he should go, he didn’t. 

We signed up for counseling again. Shortly after signing up for counseling, I found his phone on the kitchen counter and found messages between him and another woman. He said awful things about me and entertained highly sexual messages from her. I told him I felt very exhausted and lacked motivation to go to therapy. He insisted the texts were “a joke” and got extremely mad. In November, he packed up his things to move out only to come back only two days later. 

When he came back, he was clearly under the influence of something. He expected us to welcome him with open arms but I was tired/annoyed and didn’t care to see him. Our child was having a fit that evening he came back. He told them he was ashamed to have them as their child. I was horrified and grossed out by his behavior. He tried to get intimate with me when he returned. I told him no repeatedly I wanted none of it - that I need to feel emotionally connected and I did not at all. He kept on and on and ended up pleasing himself right next to me.

The next day, I was trying to work at my desk. He asked to be intimate. I told him no. I was clear. I explained again that it was not personal or punishment, but rather I could literally not get into it because I didn’t feel connected to him at all. He ignored me and picked me up proceeded to do his thing and I just lay there, quite detached from reality and my surroundings. My eyes teared up. This was in December. 

Since that time, about six months ago now, I have been going to therapy yet I still haven’t been able to look at him the same, much less give him a hug or touch his hand. When I am near him, my entire body shuts down and I am angry. After weeks of him acting like I was playing a victim, he tries to apologize / reconcile but felt over the top. He was trying so hard buying me coffees in the morning leaving notes. And something told me none of it felt genuine. I explained how I felt, he called me a bitch/cunt and said I was playing with my life. 

When I said something he didn’t like the other day, we were in front of our child, he completely lost all control and slammed his head repeatedly in anger in front of our child to the point my husband gave himself a large goose egg. 

A couple of weeks ago, I made the decision to file for divorce. Something in me tells me there is more to this life than this and like I can love myself better than this. Yet, I am nervous. I don’t want to be a victim of “grass is greener” syndrome, my husband seems to think I am melodramatic. I am in my mid-30s and worried about the impact all of this will have on our child. 

Hoping for brighter days ahead!

1kx5w5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SRRSFakeStories/comments/1kx5w5w/my_sisters_haunted_duplex/,My Sister's Haunted Duplex,"In the early 2000s a man murdered his wife by shooting her with a shot gun through their front door as she was holding it shut. I remember that day because our school went on lockdown as the husband ran from the police and I was stuck in the school cafeteria with my band class, staring at the outside doors and hearing the police sirens in the distance. One of the first responders, my stepdad, said that the wife refused to die until she knew her children were safe (they went to my school and I didn’t see them anymore after that day) and that her forearm was shot apart but she still had enough attached to hold onto the phone, waiting for confirmation. When she knew the children were safe she let go of the phone and her life.

Ten years later my sister and her 3 year old daughter moved into the duplex where this murder occurred. It was a small 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom place but it was affordable and fit their situation. She is superstitious and didn’t love living in a place with such a tragic history, but the rent was too good to pass it up.

They had many subtle experiences, unusual noises and visions at the corner of their eyes. Her daughter still remembers seeing people standing in the shadows of her room when she was trying to sleep. One story she always told, though, is how one morning she woke up to find every drawer and cabinet opened in her kitchen. She knew her daughter couldn’t have done it because some of the cabinets were too high for her to reach even if she managed to climb onto the counters. She told this story for years, even after moving to a new place, as one of her favorite anecdotes and best evidence for the existence of ghosts.

I’m not the biggest believer in ghosts but I have my own story of that place I was too afraid to tell her about for a long time. One evening I was babysitting her daughter and accidentally left my laptop charger. I returned in the middle of the night to retrieve it, she lived a few blocks away so I just walked there, and was as quiet as possible when entering the place. I found my charger on her coffee table. The place is so small that you can see every doorway and room from the living room. I remember peering into the small hallway that led to the two bedrooms and bathroom and seeing a thick, unnatural darkness, and then I looked to the kitchen where pale moonlight glinted against the cracked tile floor. The darkness of the hallway scared me into the lightness of the kitchen. The refrigerator, old but lovingly covered in child drawings and postcards, drew my attention because it reminded me of a recent incident at my work. Then each cabinet door and drawer, even the high ones my niece couldn’t reach, carefully opened one-by-one before my eyes, not making a single creak or rattle. I could feel a bitter, vengeful giddiness in the air as each door and drawer opened. My throat closed in fear like invisible hands were wrapped around it and I had a hard time breathing and swallowing as my own, very visible, hands shook with every careful movement. After all, wouldn’t you be shaking with giddiness and fear if you didn’t want to get caught pulling a revenge prank on your sister? I know I was.

At the time my sister and I were working at the same restaurant and she and one of our co-workers put something that humiliated me on the fridge (something embarrassing that I had written and thrown away.) To this day I’m still so mortified by what I wrote that I’m not even going to tell you what it was. My anger at her, however, has long subsided. I told her the truth about my little prank about five years later when she was retelling the story at a family campfire. She wasn’t upset at me (we have turned the anecdote into a funny story instead of a scary one) but I am still upset at myself for being so petty. I don’t know if I’m the reason she moved out of that duplex (I think it was her second pregnancy that led her to wanting a bigger place) but I still regret being so insensitive to her stressful situation and I know today I wouldn’t do such a thing to her. Still, I feel a little bit of pride from pulling it off so successfully.",1,1748399360.0,u_SRRSFakeStories,0,1.0,False

Blood pressure: 122/72
Total Cholesterol: 229
HDL: 63
Triglycerides: 78

I am someone who is relatively active and had always had in my head that would keep any bad numbers down but I was definitely wrong. I know I ate a lot of processed foods and my weakness is my snacking, especially late night. I am in the process of identifying these issues and changing my diet. I believe my toughest to change is going to be breakfast as I typically eat a bagel or eggs along with an iced coffee. My doctor told me to cut down coffee even though I only have one a day but it does have the sugar in the flavors I get. Lunches, I typically eat a turkey and cheese with a bag of chips. Dinner was my most troublesome where I’d pack in the trans fats and saturated fats out of laziness for cooking and would eat Trader Joe’s frozen products etc.

For breakfast now, I am starting to eat steel cut oats, some fruit, flax seeds and oikos triple zero yogurt.

I’m curious to hear what others success stories are and if you think it’s possible to lower my LDL to under 100 in 6 months to a year. This is the first time I’ve had bloodwork in 3 years and had never ever gotten high results in my life.",1,1748399206.0,Cholesterol,2,1.0,False
1kx5ubv,https://i.redd.it/qkn69nwgof3f1.jpeg,The Last Day of My Rite Aid Pharmacy Before Permanent Closure,"I've been a pharmacy tech at Rite Aid since the fall of 2021. Back then, the place still had a pulse. I remember when Heyward Donigan, our CEO at the time, started rolling out these “Stores of the Future” and talking up this RxRevolution like she was unveiling the cure for old age. The idea was to blend traditional and western medicine at the pharmacy counter, her big pitch for the future. Most of the pharmacists just thought it was a waste of money. To be honest, it was. All we got were new uniforms, some over-designed signage, and a logo that looked like it belonged on a toothpaste tube. Corporate burned millions rebranding everything, and all it did was make the higher-ups feel like they’d done something important.  

Despite all the chaos above my pay grade, I liked my job. The regulars who came in for their meds were decent people. The staff felt like family, especially Bob, our pharmacy manager. He was in his sixties, with a white mustache and this jolly way of telling bad jokes while counting pills. Sometimes it felt like we were the only steady thing in the neighborhood. But even then, I could sense something underneath the surface, a kind of rot.  

It started with the earnings reports. Every quarter was worse than the last, no matter how much the CEO tried to spin it. Then Donigan quit out of nowhere. We all knew she was just the first rat off the sinking ship. The next CEO, Busy Burr, didn’t even unpack before Jeffrey Stein came in. He was a bankruptcy guy, one of those suits who comes in, cuts everything to the bone, and walks off with a fat bonus. Stein didn’t care about the stores, or the people. He just wanted his $20 million and a clean exit.  

By the time the company crawled out of bankruptcy in fall 2024, there was nothing left. The shelves were empty. I used to watch the front-end staff try to flex the few items we had, turning them sideways, spreading them out, trying to hide the gaps. But you can’t hide a void like that. Customers stopped coming. Those who still needed their prescriptions started transferring them out. The shipments got slower and slower until we were lucky to get a box a week.  

Today is our last day. The breakroom smells like old coffee and cardboard. The lights flicker even more than usual, but maintenance stopped showing up months ago. I’m standing behind the counter, watching the clock, feeling the slow creep of dread in my chest. We’re ghosts already, just waiting for the doors to lock behind us.  

Bob came in this morning, moving slower than usual. He looked at the shelves and just shook his head. There’s nothing left to say. We’re all being replaced, thrown away like empty pill bottles, while the C-suite and their consultants pick apart the company’s bones for whatever cash is left.   

It’s the little things that hurt the most. The sound of the receipt printer, once a constant hum, is gone. The pharmacy phone barely rings. I realize I’ll never see the regulars again, the old lady who always brought in hard candies, the young dad who joked about baby-proofing his house. They’re gone, scattered to other stores, other routines.  

I keep expecting to feel relief, like I’m waking from a nightmare. But it’s more like falling into one. As the sun sets, the shadows in the aisles stretch out, long and thin. The place feels colder, as if the heat’s already been turned off.  

I step out from behind the counter to take one last walk through the aisles. Every footstep echoes. I swear I hear voices behind me, just out of sight, but when I turn, there’s nothing, just the empty shelves and the dust. I run my hand along the cold metal, remembering when these aisles were full and alive. Now, every corner feels wrong. Like the store itself is holding its breath, waiting for something to finally put it out of its misery.  

I don’t know if it’s just exhaustion, or the way the dying fluorescent lights play tricks on the mind, but I keep catching glimpses of movement out of the corner of my eye. A shadow where there shouldn’t be one. The heavy hush of a store that’s been stripped of everything but memory. I wonder if the building remembers all the people who passed through, if it feels the loss the way I do.  

At closing time, Bob locks up for the last time. The key turns heavy and slow in his hand. I linger by the doors, staring out into the empty parking lot, the sky bruised and dark. There’s no ceremony, no send-off. Just the silence of a place that’s been hollowed out, picked clean by greed and neglect.  

I leave my badge on the counter. As I walk out, I look back one last time. For a split second, I swear I see someone standing at the far end of the pharmacy, someone watching, impossibly still, where the shadows are thickest. But when I blink, the figure is gone, and all that’s left is the cold, unblinking stare of the empty store.  

They say places can’t be haunted, only people. But I’m not so sure. Some ghosts are made of memories, and some are made of everything you’ve lost and can’t ever get back.

About 2 days before I was supposed to leave the UK to go back to the US, we went to the aquarium in Birmingham and had a blast. We got to feed the giant sea turtle and the black-tip sharks in their giant tunnel aquarium (pictured in my previous post), and they had an Animal Crossing event going on, we got to meet Isabelle and take pictures with her at the very end of the experience (we had to pay for the pictures but we got to meet her and feed the sharks for free, which was super cool)! 😄🦈🥰💗

The last couple pictures were taken maybe 2 hours before we had to get in the Uber to go to the airport, our last snuggle before I had to say goodbye and go back to the US. We were bawling our eyes out and trying to comfort each other and telling ourselves this goodbye won't be forever (because I'll be damned if it is) trying to be as close as we could for as long as we could before we had to go back to being half a world apart. Once we got to the airport, it was easy getting boarding passes/checked bags and had about an hour before I had to pass through security and board my plane, which was just enough time to share one last coffee together. My biggest regret that day (other than not staying forever, of course) was that our final kiss at the security gate wasn't nearly as long as I would've liked it to be. 

As I said in my first post, that trip was the best 1 week of my life 🥹💝 Nothing else has ever come close to it. We shared a lot of firsts together while I was visiting; we were each other's first kiss, first dinner date, first cuddle, and so many other things. I cannot wait until we're able to see each other again. I love her and I miss her so much, I haven't gotten a proper night's sleep since I've been back.

1kx5tzm,https://i.redd.it/mdpzb7adof3f1.jpeg,Fritz (Hazbin hotel oc.),"Nickname: Fritz

True Name: Vincent Sensivero

Biological age: 28 

Gender: Male

Pronouns: He/him

Sexuality: Pansexual

Date of birth: July 7th, 1984 

Place of birth: Brevard County, Florida

Death: August 16th, 2012

Relationship status: Single (and ready to mingle ;>)

Height: 5ft 10in

Life on Earth: At a young age, he always liked to keep to himself, mostly relying on hours and hours of TV, books, and any game imaginable. He would excel not only in school but in college as well. Vincent always wanted to take things apart and put them back together to fully understand them and possibly make them better in the process. After getting their bachelor's in mechanical engineering, he eventually enlisted in the United States Air Force. Vincent would start designing, building, and testing new, state-of-the-art aircraft there. Vincent and the rest of the group he worked with never necessarily made any groundbreaking discoveries, but they were a group of hard-working and determined groups fixed on perfection. By this point, most people would refer to Vincent by his call sign, “Fritz.” No one knew where the name came from, but everyone knew it was a perfect fit for the sporadic, intelligent, and lazy kind of guy Vincent was at his core. After an accident involving a faulty ejection seat landed Fritz in the hospital, he began to suffer the effects of untreated damage to his amygdala and sensory cortex, most likely due to inadequate treatment and examination. It wasn't long before Fritz was discharged from the Air Force and his pilot license revoked due to an insufficient mental state. After Fritz was discharged from the Air Force, he became a lonely but somewhat successful AC and heat pump repairman. This job would be the closest he would ever get back to engineering, and he would continue to go down from there. Weed would quickly become a new addiction for Fritz. Along with mostly short and chaotic relationships and getting into fights over the smallest grudges, Fritz wasn’t going anywhere. He never had the guts to end it all; he knew his heart wouldn't be able to take that, and he thought too fondly of his family, who supported him through everything. The day he died was like any other for Fritz; on his way to work, he got himself into a major car wreck on the highway that ended up in a massive explosion. By the time rescue workers got to him, his body had been completely dismembered.

Life in Hell: Fritz was never a believer, despite how much his parents forced him into Christianity. The guy was on the verge of going mental when he was first dropped in Hell, but he feared even more what would happen to him if he died a second time, so Fritz listened to his head and kept going. Fritz was quick to learn how the pride ring worked, and a small part of him enjoyed how chaotic it was. It was as for the first time in his existence; he was outnumbered by crazy people, making him look like a normal person or something like that. As luck would have it, he would quickly find a new job in the local sanitation department working various jobs. Fritz would also find an outlet for his mental aggression through a side hustle, specifically being a bodyguard/bouncer, mostly during the night. Despite the challenges he faces, Fritz has started to become more of a social butterfly, and every day feels a little bit freer in this crazy, crazy world he can't help but love.

He was kind of facing away but I was like 95% sure it was Elijah Wood. He was with others so I didn't want to bother him and fan-girl when he wasn't alone, especially since I wasn't 100% sure, so I let it be.

Eventually, I decided to go get a bottle of water because I was getting thirsty and I wanted to hydrate before boarding. While waiting to pay, there he was again but he was talking. Once I heard his voice, I was 100% sure. I debated interrupting to say hi, but decided against it because I really didn't want to intrude when he wasn't alone. It was a hard decision, but I let it be.

A bit of back story before I go on. I lost my dad in 2012 and my mom in 2015. Prior to my mom passing, I always fit the extended cuts of LotR in during the Christmas holiday period and once she passed away it became my firm tradition. I've spent every Christmas day with Elijah, Sean, Billy, Dominic, and the gang for over a decade now. On a day when nothing was open and I had nowhere to go, and all my friends were busy with their families and I couldn't talk to anyone, I was with these guys, some leftover Chinese food I bought the day before when restaurants were open, coffee, and hot chocolate. I turned an otherwise pretty sad day for me into something really enjoyable that I look forward to every year now.

Cut back to today, I went to a Starbucks to grab a coffee while still waiting for my flight to board and one of his party walks in. She was only a minute behind me and alone so I worked up the nerve to just request she pass on the message of how much those movies mean to me. She was so kind and patient and said she would. Her response really filled my heart, and I figured whether she did or not, her patience and openness to just accept the words I wanted to share even though she had no obligation to was already more than enough.

As luck would have it, they were on my flight! While boarding, the person I had spoken to pointed me out to Elijah. He came over with a smile on his face, I stumbled all over my words, he engaged me and asked my name, where I was going, and let me tell my story again. I made a fool of myself a bit, but this was still the highlight of my year so far. Elijah also practiced such kindness with a big smile on his face and let me take a picture with him. Even if he didn't want to do it, as I understand he is a rather private person, he indulged me and he just let a fan have a moment.

While I'd love to share the photo, I know he keeps his life private so I'm going to keep it to myself, and that's also why im keeping a lot of the details more vague.

For all the people here who are even bigger fans than me, people say you shouldn't meet your heroes. This was an instance those people would be wrong. It was the briefest, most klutzy encounter on my part, but it kind of meant the world to me right now as I'm going through quite a rough patch. I'd like to say, if it matters to anyone as much as it does to me, he really strikes as one of the good guys. I can watch these movies with a newfound fondness in my heart knowing one of my Christmas Day pals gave me a moment of his day to put a stupid smile on my face.

It led me to a major decision about myself and my career that I've never forgotten.

I transcribed it here so I wouldn't forget.

""I don't think this is a contentious notion - that the self is an illusion. Importantly though, the self is a helpful function, illusory or otherwise, like digestion, or sneezing. It brings coherence to the chronological happenstance of our lives. If the self cracks and confuses then everything from employment to parenting could be affected. That is of course for  involuntary cracking. 

What about deliberate chiselling?

We do this already and call it learning, adapting, or growing. Experience introduces new colours and carvings to our evolving selves, as we discover new canvases and rock. Experience may even embolden us to look beyond our current tools and wonder about stones we've never seen. 

Perhaps whole caves of selves wait for us out there, unshapen.
 
We may further realize that our current self is not something entirely of our making. Genetics, upbringing, and just individual circumstances have shaped our selves into, if we are fortunate, something coherent and aligned to the demands of our respective environments. If we consider the self then as a kind of continuous optimization process, then whole swathes of our inherited selves could be supplanted by new selves of our conscious making.""

1kx5onk,https://www.reddit.com/r/swiftiecirclejerk/comments/1kx5onk/swiftologist_vs_taylor_watch/,Swiftologist vs Taylor Watch,"Hey everyone, long-time Swiftie and lover of all things Taylor here. I wanted to open a respectful but honest conversation about the recent drama that’s been bubbling online between two Taylor Swift–focused content creators: Zach (aka *The Swiftologist*) and the duo from *Taylor Watch*, Kelly and Gia.

For those not fully caught up, here’s the gist:  
On a recent *Taylor Watch* episode, Kelly briefly referenced “the guy everyone hates” in a discussion about fans listening to “stolen versions” of Taylor’s music. Based on the context, she was likely referring to Swiftologist, who has gotten pushback in the past for expressing a preference for Taylor’s original versions over the re-recordings. Importantly, it didn’t seem like Kelly was saying *she* hated him—more that he gets hate online, which... he does. A lot. He even acknowledges this in his own content and says he blocks/report people for hate regularly. So, I interpreted it more like commentary than a personal attack.

But then Zach responded with this TikTok:   
Let’s break it down.

He opens with, “This is a message for the *Barstool Sports* Taylor Swift podcast,” with a noticeably loaded tone. Now, whatever your feelings are about Barstool, *Chicks in the Office* and *Call Her Daddy* came from there and are massive platforms. Dismissing them as a way to indirectly minimize *Taylor Watch* felt unnecessary.

Then, Zach accuses the girls of repeatedly talking about him and demands they stop. But from what I’ve heard, it was a single off-hand comment. Not a segment, not a rant—just a nod to a polarizing figure in the fandom. Which, if we’re being fair, he is.

But then the real problem: he calls Kelly and Gia “ghouls” and “beasts.”  
That *crossed a serious line*. As a fanbase (and a feminist one at that), we *should* be hyper-aware of the misogynistic undertones behind attacking women’s appearances or dehumanizing them—especially in a public, performative way. Zach, who makes a name for himself analyzing Taylor’s PR decisions and the media’s treatment of her, *should* know better. He’s well-versed in how women are picked apart, scrutinized, and dismissed for things that wouldn’t even raise an eyebrow if a man did them.

What’s ironic is that this could’ve been a classy moment for him to say:  
“Hey, I saw I was mentioned—I get that I’m polarizing, but just a reminder I’m a real person with a name and a point of view. Let’s keep things respectful.”  
But instead, he went full condescension mode, took cheap shots, and then pivoted into a “humble brag” about being on tour. Except… the numbers don’t exactly support the superiority he was implying. *Taylor Watch* has a strong online presence: 77k followers, with Kelly at 88k and Gia at 27k. *Evolution of a Snake*, which he referenced in his clapback, has 18k followers, and his personal account sits around 20k. So if the message was “I’m more relevant,” that feels… questionable.

This all left a bad taste in my mouth. I used to enjoy Zach’s content—it’s structured, informative, and often offers deep dives into Taylor lore that you won’t find elsewhere. Sure, he reads off a prompt and sometimes sounds like ChatGPT, but I appreciated the research. That said, I *unsubscribed* after this.

Because here’s the thing: *Taylor Watch* feels like hanging out with your best friends, chatting Taylor lore over iced coffee, unstructured and real. It’s girlhood, it’s vibes. Swiftologist is polished and scholarly. Both have value. But you can’t come after someone for being fun and casual just because it’s different from what you do. Especially not with *personal insults*.

And finally—yes, criticism is fair game in media. But the way you engage with your critics says everything about your character. If you want respect in this fandom, you have to give it too. It made me reflect on how different fan voices interact. There's room for both well-researched, structured Swiftology and light, casual fandom chats. They don’t have to compete. But when creators take offense and respond with aggression—especially when it involves women being mocked—it shifts the tone from fun to mean.

I am a 22 year old woman. I keep seeing two apparitions.

I had a medium come over for my boyfriend’s birthday and the medium brought up this woman that I keep seeing, I couldn’t believe that she knew who i was talking about. she told me the woman was lost. She was sad and she didn’t know why she was there. She wasn’t sure if she knew me, but for some reason, this medium knew that I keep seeing this apparition of this woman. 
I haven’t seen her in my dreams only in person sometimes she comes behind people and stands there . 
The medium said that women been trying to reach me in her dreams 
but she keeps failing. 
my whole friend group knows about her. no one else has seen her but me. 
Sometimes she will open her mouth and point like she’s trying to tell me something . 
She’s about 5‘8“ tall she has blue jeans on almost like a bright colored long sleeve shirt
she has dark shoulder length hair, and a longer nose . 
She will pop out of nowhere I haven’t seen her anywhere else besides my home. just standing in different locations of the house. 

i don’t feel threatened. i don’t think she is harmful. 
I don’t know how to contact her. 
i don’t know if she’s strong enough for me to even communicate with her. 

There is also a male figure that lives in my home he just comes as a shadow. 
He loves blue grass and country. he will often turn on my tv or alexa and play random country music. 
he’s angry. 
that’s all i know is he’s angry he died 
i hear foot steps 
weird noises 
while me and my boyfriend were watching tv in my bedroom. i heard loud music in the living room(my roommate) was not home at the time, we were alone. we stopped the tv show we were watching and the music was blasting in the living room. He grabbed a knife thinking someone was in the house and i opened the bedroom door, we walked down the hallway to the tv. The tv was blasting 96 volume playing a youtube video that was just country. (i don’t listen to country). As soon as i turn the corner to record the video stops and goes to youtube screen with all the accounts that are shown on it. Then we hear the same music start over in my bedroom. i didn’t know what to do or where to go but i felt it walking around the room with me. the remotes were in a glass container in the middle of the coffee table. 
to connect to my youtube you need a code and to be on my wifi. 
I checked my history and there was no such video on it. no country no music no video. 

that was abt 6 months ago. 

2 months ago the alexa turned on blasting country music too. 
i could have sworn i unplugged it. 

i learn to live with them but i don’t know why they are here and i know it’s not the home it’s self that is haunted.

But on other side she would gift the manager gifts out of nowhere, she would get coffee almost everyday Friday for everyone, she would get supplies on her own money. And after that she
 would complain I have 0$ in my bank account.
When I started working there, I was pretty good at my job and always on time never called out and she did not like that because she thought after few weeks I will get more hours than her. So now she started complaining about small stuff that won’t even make no difference in program running to the manager. When the higher manager would come to visit she would have an hour long meeting with her with the list of complaints she had about the new hires. And I was right about her intentions because an old employee who has been there for 2 years said because of her so many new hires have been fired in just couple of months. I don’t why but manger liked it and always favoured it and a few days back when I was supposed to be promoted in a way that I will get full 8-9 hours of work I did not get it because someone said I need more training and can not handle more hours and maybe consider giving full hours next year.

I'm in tears.,"First off the vet said it had to happen today. I'm left here scratching my head. She was just over 3 years. Pasture fed, and gets a coffee can scoop of grain daily and access to fresh water.

I was on a 4 day trip, wife was home watching over things. Before the trip my teenager rode her two weeks before for 15 mins walking only since she's young around the pasture. But we only ride once or twice a week at best. Usually I ground train her twice a week for about 20 mins. 

Upon returning from the trip wife said the horses haven't come up in two days. So I called for them and brought them up to the house and put them in the pasture by my bay windows by my living room. Watching them for hours. 

The Roan didn't graze on the grass layed completely flat for like an hour. Getting up and lying back down. I started fearing colic. I put her in the pin that night with water and a quarter flake of hay not sure of colic but seeing if she ate. She ate at some of it. She urinated blood 3 times last night and no bowel movement. Took her to the vet this morning and she urinated blood 2 more times. The vet emergency team came out and checked her temp listing to belly did blood test. The said concerning noises from belly and gums are grey not bubble gum pink meaning bad blood circulation. 

 The vets came back 20 mins later and said she has colic and a 5 lactic acid in her body and that 2 under I normal 0 is healthy. Told me that I need to put her down today. Said her organs are failing. Took her home she was spry for about 20 grazing the more blood came out. Slight bloody diarrhea. Then went back to lethargic.

I have two other horses. They all got vaccinated month ago with Equine 6+1.

I am so very confused and worried.  I've had her for about a year. 

If your here to tell me I neglect my horses I am retired and train and am apart of there lives daily. So move along with any negativity. 

Please if anyone has any advice please share. 

The vet said there was nothing abnormal in there blood other than lactic acid at 5 which is dangerous. Two vets consoled me and seems genuine.

It was a weekend when neither of us had our kids. We happened to sit next to each other among a group of people and had great conversations. He talked a lot about his high school-aged kids and how busy he is with their activities. After a few hours, I was about to leave, thinking he was just being friendly. He seemed very polite, kind, and considerate. Before I left, he asked for my number. I told him I have an elementary school-aged child. We realized our custody schedules were similar, so we thought coordinating a date would be manageable. That same night, he asked me out for a quick coffee date later in the week, mid-week, in my area since we both had our kids that upcoming weekend.

First date: About a week and a half passed without any texts or phone calls. Then he texted me to let me know he was running five minutes late—not a big deal, since the place was just minutes from my house. He showed up, apologized, and we talked about our kids, our ages (we’ve both been divorced for five years), hobbies, work, where we grew up, and how he takes care of his elderly parent who lives in an assisted living facility ten minutes from his home. He remembered everything I had shared when we first met. He casually commented on our age difference twice. About 50 minutes in, I got an urgent work call, so I apologized and had to leave. He asked if I’d like to see him again, and I said yes. We didn’t discuss a specific plan. That weekend we both had our kids, so I texted him to ask about his availability. A few hours later, he replied saying he’d be free the following weekend when our kids would be with the other parents. He suggested a dinner date and gave me several restaurant options in my area, and I picked one.

Second date: Again, no texts or calls between dates—over a week of silence. Over dinner, we dove into deeper topics: what we learned from our divorces, what we’re looking for in a relationship, our career paths, families, co-parenting dynamics, religion, politics, and past relationships post-divorce. He remembered everything we’d discussed at the coffee date. He said he hopes to be with someone long-term, but it doesn’t have to be marriage. He’s not rushing into anything and doesn’t force relationships. He said he’s had three short-term relationships and realized he wasn’t actually ready at the time. I told him I haven’t dated since my divorce because I was focused on work and raising my child, and that I wanted to work on myself first. I also said I’m not into short-term dating and would like a long-term relationship, hopefully leading to remarriage. He talked about his kids a lot and seems very involved. He mentioned he's excited to see what the future holds after his high schoolers move out in the next two years. He paid for dinner. The restaurant eventually closed and kicked us out. He mentioned needing to pick up his kids from their mom’s place the next morning because she was traveling. He offered to walk me to my car and asked if he could kiss me. I always feel a bit of pressure in those situations, though he didn’t do anything wrong—I said yes. It was a brief kiss. He asked when we could meet again, and I told him I’d check my calendar. I texted him the next day with my availability. He replied right away and we scheduled a third date. He gave me some dinner options, but this time they were all near his home. I wasn’t ready to be intimate (I barely know him), so I suggested a midpoint location, and he agreed.

Third date: Again, no texts or phone calls for over a week. I brought it up and asked if he texts. He said he sees texting as just a tool and prefers phone calls—but only answers them, not initiates them. He said if I want to text, he’ll reply, and if I want to talk, he’ll answer the phone. This is not the type of communication I’m used to, so I’m a bit confused. If someone’s interested, wouldn’t they want to talk or check in? I like to feel a bit pursued. During dinner, we talked about ideal vacations and weekends. He said he’d like to see more of his best friends, but they’re married and busy with kids. He also shared that he hopes to visit his friend in southern France one day—with his future wife or long-term partner. Our conversation ranged from heavy to light topics. He paid again but disclosed that his finances are tight. We both earn decent incomes. With our age difference and career types, he earns more than I do—but I earn more than most men my age. He explained that his ex-wife was a stay-at-home mom and that, by law, he has been paying her alimony in addition to child support since the divorce (she filed). It’s not a dealbreaker, but I wasn’t thrilled that he mentioned money being tight during a date. I offered to pay (even though I didn’t really want to), but he declined. He didn’t complain or speak poorly about past relationships, family, or his ex-wife, but he did say he realized how important it is for women to have careers and financial independence—and that he teaches this to his kids. As we were leaving the restaurant, he got a call from one of his kids who had just had a major argument with their mom (his ex). He had mentioned previously that she has serious depression and is on strong medication. He apologized, and I told him not to worry. I asked if that kind of thing happens often, and he said it does sometimes. He walked me to my car and kissed me again. He told me he had recently deleted his dating app and would be happy not dating anyone else while getting to know me. That felt spontaneous. He also mentioned still remembering how lonely it felt during his marriage when he was always the giver. He said he was emotionally exhausted from constantly comforting his ex-wife and not having his own emotional needs met.

Now, I’m confused about his intentions and feelings. He is very polite, thoughtful, and kind. He’s easy to make plans with—quick and efficient. He never checks his phone during our dates and is fully present and attentive. But I wonder if he’s emotionally unavailable. It seems like he has a lot going on—supporting his ex-wife (they’re on friends term but she leans on him often), being active in his kids’ lives (which is fine—I’m busy with mine too), and helping care for his elderly parent.

I’m Dee.

I’ve been in Toronto for just over a year now. Before this, I never stayed anywhere longer than four years as an adult. I guess you could say I’m a bit of a nomad — moving from one concrete box to the next, always chasing something deeper.

Toronto’s a big place, full of people who sometimes just skim the surface. I’m here because I want more than that. I want real conversations, moments that slow down time, and connections that go beyond the usual small talk.

If you’re in your late 20s or early 30s, and you’re someone who likes diving deep — whether into ideas, emotions, or just life’s strange twists — I’d really like to hear from you.

Maybe we start with a walk by the lake, a coffee somewhere cozy, or just exploring the city’s quieter spots (I spotted a momma deer and a baby deer last weekend in the city). No pressure, no rush — just two people seeing if there’s something real.

If that sounds like you, send me a message. Let’s figure out if there’s a spark.

I have been NC with my in laws for a half year by now (been married for 8 years, husband decided to join NC as a show of united front). 

My life today is the best I had in the past 8 years. I never knew how much could in laws mess with ones psyche until I got the full experience of it. Now, with all this being said, it doesn't mean I am solid about my decision of going NC. It was one of the most difficult ones and I question it at least once a day, eveyday. I still daydream of family that could have been, still feeling bad for all difficult feelings. It is everyday mandatory torture but I still stand by what I said earlier. My life is still the best I have had in the past 8 years. Go figure and imagine stuff in between. 

Now I ran into couple of articles glossing over ""rising numbers of children going NC with their parents"". The reason why? Individualism. 

The individualism of children putting themselves first and protecting their health and interest, above the family unit. 

It makes me want to scream. It is as if all people who went NC decided to do so as if one decides to go out for coffee to make their life just a little nicer. Or to get a fresh manicure. That kind of stuff. Not as the decision of mere survival after one finds themselves in dark corner for way too long.

I agree individualism is at blame... It is the individualism of the parents who do not see anything else but themselves. Who view their children as a mere extension of themselves and who deserve to be punished if they do things other that what is expected. Of parents who believe their job has ended at the ripe age of 18 and now they are owed holidays done exactly as they want them. Who are owed well-styled family photos of growing families under big #blessed. Never be present, never share heartbreak, not hear of infertility, they only want to have grandkids, they never want to help in any capacity because that is not what they are interested in, since they have already done their job. It's the individualism of parents getting on another fun cruise with full expectation that once they are back, the kids will be lined up and ready to participate in orchestrated Sunday dinners.Somehow, in their mind, that is what the family is for- the well-earned retirement good-time only.

However,  it seems that nobody is willing to discuss that kind of individualism. Every NC child is just doing this overly-individualistic lifestyle decision and every left behind parent is left confused why. All  these articles are written from sterile statistical perspective that just correlates numbers and tacks them on those who make decision- children who made impossible decision and now earned themselves label ""individualistic"".

1kx5ao2,https://www.reddit.com/r/legoland/comments/1kx5ao2/first_visit_mixed_review/,First Visit - Mixed Review,"Here’s the short version customer matters and we experienced very little of it. 

We just stayed at Legoland Beach Retreat for three nights with park tickets. Third night was free and it was $1600 plus lunch and dinners. 

Legoland: the good things about our park experience over Memorial Day weekend. 1) The wait times even on a busy weekend never exceeded 10 minutes. We rode every ride we wanted to. 2) Some of the rides were fantastic. Kitty disco drop, Ninjago, Battle for Bricksburg were fantastic. We loved some of the Lego stops like building and racing cars. 3) Parking was easy and there isn’t really a bad spot. 4) The splash pad at Peppa Pig was fun and well shaded. On the other side… 1) The park was a little dirty and we never noticed anyone cleaning up as we walked around. 2) we stopped at apple fries to ask if there was anywhere else that had something other than vanilla ice cream and were told no. There are at least two other places in the park we found with ice cream in the name. One was just 100 feet away. 3) We ate lunch at Kickin’ Chicken. All of the BbQ sauce and all of the ketchup was empty at multiple stations. 4) Our ticket reservations included Sea Life, but that did not show on the digital ticket. Although it was clear on the reservation, we were told we would have to exit the park, stand in the line at the ticket booth, and “they might be able to fix it.” 

Beach Retreat: Let’s start with the good again. 1) It’s quiet even on a holiday weekend. Sat outside in the morning drinking coffee and reading and never disturbed. 2) Breakfast is included and was great. 3) The wait staff at breakfast specifically did a really job serving the tables and keeping up with the many people coming and going. Each morning they went out of their way to make breakfast a great experience. 4) Playgrounds in the center of each area are a really nice addition. Gave the kids something to do while hanging out at the room. Now the not good… 1) other than the wizard text thread, there is no one to speak to about a problem. 2) the shuttle only runs in the morning and late afternoon. It did not run between 12 and 3 PM. 3) Wait staff at lunch and dinner seemed to lack training to tend to their tables. Service was slow, we waited for refills, and received our check before ordering desert. 4) Actual pool times and what was posted were not the same. It did not open at the times posted. 5) mi wife requested extra pillows and was told that four would be delivered to the room. Later to be told, there were no extra pillows at the hotel. 6) Not once did housekeeping service our room. We had to request replacement towels and were only given two new towels. Coffee pods were never replaced and garbage was never taken out. Additionally, one of our kiddos had an accident in the bed. We were given new sheets, but no mattress pad, no blanket, and no new pillow. Also the dirty sheets were never removed from the room. Although communicating with the wizard that same morning letting them know. That evening, I texted the wizard and let them know that the dirty sheets were outside in the porch. The room now smelled bad. After multiple messages with the wizard, the sheets were picked up and we were brought new coffee cups, not pods.  

Legoland definitely has some wins, but the lack of customer service will keep us from returning for more than a single day at the park. ",1,1748397592.0,legoland,3,1.0,False

# As per the subject, i know I am at fault for reading my Wife's old messages. I was tasked with clearing the apple account on an old device and while doing so i curiously looked at some old texts. Now i know things that i don't know how to move forward from.

For context, my wife (40F) and I (41M) have been together for around 8 years. Prior to our relationship, my wife was married and living in America. I was told her husband had a drinking problem and was an abusive. She returned to Australia after divorcing and we were setup by mutual friends around 4 months later. I was aware at the time that my partner had been on a couple of other dates from a guy who owned a local coffee shop, but apparently the dates fizzled. My wife and I have had a pretty good relationship for the passed 8 years and we have two children together. I have never had reason to be jealous. My Wife always seemed fairly conservative sexually and in the early stages of our relationship i remember it being nearly two months in before we first had sex.

However, with access to the old iPhone I was curious to read how my Wife described me to her friends. I was fairly shocked when reading through the message history from this time period to see that while early into our dating phase my wife was clearly involved sexually in the guy from the coffee shop. Infact, it reads as though this guy was clearly the guy my wife preferred. But she ended up settling for me when his interests didn't seem to go beyond sex. However, the overlap of the obviously sexual relationship goes for around 2 months into a period of time where i would have considered my Wife and I a couple. Comparing dates to text history on my phone, there is one particular date where I had organised dinner during the week. I remember taking her our and dropping her home by 10pm. Around 30 minutes later, she wrote to the coffee shop guy ""Come over?"". He simply responded ""Ok ;)""

I get that this is probably normal in modern dating for people to be juggling a few possible contenders. This is my issue to deal with. But i am certainly surprised at this point.

However, it doesn't end there. It turns out there is an entirely separate thread from another person named Joe, who is based in the US. Around 1 year into the relationship with my Wife. Joe is sending messages professing his love for my Wife. From what i can tell, My Wife and Joe ""Hooked up"" while she was living in the US. This is referred to as one of the main reasons my wife ended up divorcing. As her husband at the time found out. What i read describes a whole different scenario to how my Wife became divorced and moved back to Australia. Despite these messages being 12 months into my relationship with my wife she is clearly very forward with Joe. My wife mentions to him that she wished she could go back in time to when she was still in America. She says to him that if he had been as forward with her back then things would have turned out different. She even says she found him so hot she didn't trust herself around him.

So here I am feeling guilty for having exploited my wife's privacy. I know this was wrong. But now i know what i know and i feel like crap. But i can't even bring it up because the focus would be what an AH i am for reading the messages. Do i just need to accept that we've been together long enough that the things that occurred when the relationship was newer shouldn't affect us going forward?",16,1748397477.0,relationship_advice,28,0.83,False

They used to print at warming but this was turned off because warming is far from the register, and often there is someone planted there during rushes. Now, cafe brewed doesn't print anywhere. 

Apparently, my DM got ""lots of complaints"" about cafe customers not getting their coffees fast enough and that baristas are ""forgetting"" to serve them (but we all know it's because they walk away to handoff). 

Now cafe brewed will print beside POS so they ""don't get lost""... but here's the thing, it will also print MO&P brewed, Delivery brewed, and DT brew so that bar can stay ""focused on handcrafted beverages"". The POS barista is now responsible for all of these channels - at least when someone is planted on POS. We have been told we aren't allowed to go out of order to prioritize cafe - if anything DT takes priority. 

Is this normal? It's been about a week and a half since the install, and it seems very overwhelming for many of the new-ish barista's to make everyones coffee and tea when there is a line.

I don’t really post stuff like this but I don’t have anyone in my life I can actually ask. So… here I am.

I’m 16F and there’s this guy I know — he’s 24. We met in real life a few months ago (not online). He works near where I take my weekend classes, and we just started talking randomly one day. It wasn’t flirty at first, just small stuff like music, books, what we’re into.

But over time, we started seeing each other more. Not like dates or anything — just walking and talking, grabbing coffee sometimes. He’s never made a move or said anything inappropriate. He’s always respectful. But he does say things like “you’re wise beyond your years” and “you don’t seem like a teenager.”

And the thing is… I think I like him. Like, really like him. I know it’s probably wrong. I know people will judge me or say he’s taking advantage of me. And maybe that’s true. But when I’m with him, I feel… safe. Heard. Seen. Like I’m not invisible.

I haven’t told anyone because I don’t want to be told to “block him” or “run” — I just want someone to tell me why I feel this way, and whether it’s even possible to like someone older without it being messed up.

Please help.","Hey all, I’ve been dealing with adrenal fatigue issues (HPA axis dysfunction) for a few years now. I blame the intermittent fasting plus black coffee I was doing for a couple years. It worked out so well for me, but for the last 4-5 years I’ve been gaining weight in weird places (chest, stomach, thighs), losing muscle, dealing with reflux, dry skin, and various other issues. My lab work looks normal according to the endocrinologist, but he did mention that my estrogen might be a tad high. But he only tested my cortisol in the morning, and I don’t think that’s going to give the best picture of what’s happening. 

I’m struggling with losing weight. I’ve been meditating for the past month and a half, lowered my caffeine intake to just one cup of coffee in the morning, and also been trying to eat more consistently (no big gaps between meals), but I haven’t noticed any changes. My digestion seems better, but that’s the only real change I can see. 

Is it just matter of waiting things out? I know I’ve been in this chronically stressed state for many years now, so perhaps it’s just going to take time. It’s hard to stay positive though when I am going to job interviews and am mortified at how I look in my clothes. Thanks for any advice. ",2,1748397015.0,adrenalfatigue,2,1.0,False

I found out I had been misdiagnosed back in 2020 and was not actually going to go fully blind like I was told by a “second opinion.” I’m severely nearsighted and eventually lost part of my vision and as a painter that was hella scary so I was just making sure I was going to be ok, but then when I got a 3rd opinion my doctor was like “the fuck was that previous dude talking about? Your surgery went really well and you’re going to be ok, relax.” On top of losing my job that same year, and leaving a shitty relationship, I was ready to leave 2020 behind and start brand new. So I got good news, and then I got my dream job that paid really well. All in that first month. I was traveling a lot, treating myself, painting a bunch, and visting my home state (NYC) from Florida, which deep down I didn’t want to live in anymore. And the whole year I just lived life like a king. Take note on me not wanting to live in Florida. 

Then the next year I knew I wanted more. My job wasn’t making me as happy as it was becoming toxic with unhealthy work conditions and leadership not being professional, all while I kept visiting NYC and thinking “damn, I’ve been away for 13+ years, what if? Can I even make it on my own?” I would even visit my other best friend’s brother in Bushwick (Brooklyn) pretty often and I’d always joke “can you imagine? Me living here in Bushwick, working at a bakery on the Upper West Side, making art, just finally chilling in my home city?” But I could never, this dude paid double what I paid in rent.

I visited my best friend in July to surprise her on her birthday with news that I had made the decision to move back to NYC in a year and a half. I didn’t know how, but I just wanted more in life and I wanted to come home. I then visited NYC for my birthday in September, and literally as I was walking into RadioCity for a concert I has been super excited for, I got a text message from my brother (who was the person that got me the job) letting me know I was being let go. Shittiest present, not even a “happy birthday” (which wasn’t surprising given that I do come from a toxic family). And I felt like things were falling apart, when in reality things were falling into place. 

I spent 3 months struggling BIG TIME! I didn’t know why I was “being punished” and I struggled to even get unemployment. I even flew to NYC twice looking for work and nothing. I would even get a rejection email before I even made it to my return flight. I spent more time on Craigslist looking for work, and not in the engineering field. I looked for work at coffee shops and bakeries. I don’t know why but I kept imagining myself working a relaxing job that helped me get back on my feet while I spent time making art and healing. But nobody would email me back. Then I reached a boiling point. I said fuck it, Im leaving anyway.

I didn’t even know how to sell my car. Then my best friend told me about a company who pays off your car loan and pays you a difference. I barely got $1,000 for it. But that was enough for a one-way plane ticket. I asked my cousin if she could ask my aunt in Manhattan if I could stay with her for a couple/few weeks and my aunt said “of course!”. So I packed half a carry on, $500 in my pocket, and knew that it was all or nothing, no going back. I was leaving in 4 days. Over a year ahead of schedule.

A couple days later I got a call from a bakery for an interview that I had to attend in person the day after I landed. 20 hours after landing I had a job. My aunt then tells me not to worry about rent and that I could stay with her for as long as I needed, after all, she lived alone and had 2 empty bedrooms, she even gave me the master bedroom! She also wouldnt allow me to pay a single dollar for rent or bills, she just wanted me to get back on my feet. I never had a relationship with her before, so this just felt like an insane blessing (I literally owe her my life). Then that bakery job turned toxic, the manager I had was a bully and hated everyone, especially me (I don’t take shit from toxic people) but I still wanted to work at a bakery! I met a co worker who was my assistant manager for a very brief time, and when she left (same reasons) to work for a better bakery that paid more, guess who followed her there and got a job 2 weeks later? Yup, on the Upper West Side, not even the same location as her. 

Eventually I managed to find a room to rent where I have my own floor, private entrance, my own half bathroom, all for the same amount I used to pay in rent while living in Florida. I took over someone else’s lease and everything flowed so smoothly. And where is this apartment? In Bushwick, 4 blocks away from where my best friend’s brother lives. 

It’s been 2.5 years since I moved back to NYC. A couple weeks ago I was wondering why some of the things I want to manifest weren’t happening, I thought that maybe none of it was real. Then I started thinking back and I realized I have been manifesting my current life the entire time. 3 years ago my life was NOWHERE NEAR what my life is now. Also, I have wayyy too much right now that I need to be grateful for, and I truly am! I shouldn’t be distracting myself from the fact that I’m one of the most fortunate people alive and that I have a lot more power than I give myself credit for. 

Another example: I wanted to move to NYC to make art and celebrate the fact that I still have the ability to do what I love the most: paint, despite my condition. Then, this past summer someone reached out to write an article about my story (being a partially blind painter) for a website/magazine and a couple months later someone from Good Morning America reached out the day before thanksgiving because they wanted to interview me to share the same story. Talk about something to be thankful for.

So in conclusion, I’m going to be more than ok. I am going to achieve everything I want in life, just gotta let go and trust timing. In the meantime, I just have to focus on everything I have and be grateful. After all, I already have everything I ever wanted. ",4,1748396945.0,Manifestation,1,1.0,False

We serve up to 185 elders each day and we have a salad bar offering veggies and marinades during meals as well as snacks like bread and fruits between meals.

As you can see in the pictures, we use a lot of plastic. Bread and cereal bowls, among other things that elders can take to their apartments, must be covered in plastic wrap first (except for apples and bananas). We also have restaurant-like small spreading containers. The coffee brand we use comes in small plastic packagings. We open two of them for each filter and use about 4-5 filters each day (do the math). Veggies, marinades and salads are all put in small, single-use plastic cups, some of them not being recyclable. Now, I can understand the point of using plastic daily here :

1- It's cheap

2- It preserves freshness

3- It avoids extra dishes to clean (and we already have a lot!)

4- It gives light and reasonable portions for the elders

5- It takes very little space

BUT. Are there any alternatives I can propose to reduce the amount of plastic we use while keeping these five advantages? I love my job and I would appreciate to keep the elders happy with fresh food while giving a better example for other retirement homes in my region.

As soon as I was off work, I'd sleep and stay asleep until the next morning.

I am currently wfh. I somehow manage my job in the four or five waking hours and I only get out of my bed because I don't want my husband knowing I sleep all day.

He knows I struggle with it but not to the extent it's at. I lie a lot about how much I sleep, and cover it by saying I take long naps. On the weekends I sleep in as long as I can, but the rest of my time awake is not spent enjoying whatever activities we have planned. It is spent wishing I were sleeping, sleeping in the car, and trying to get my husband to take naps with me. This has been my life for over 3 years. 

I feel **ADDICTED**. I have seen 3 PCPs who were all are confused by that word, they said there is no addiction to sleep. I believe them, but it's what it feels like. It's causing me to lie, hide my habits, skip events, skip workouts, skip eating, skip showers, etc. so that I can sleep instead.

I saw one sleep specialist who had never heard of this and I feel like she didn't believe me at all, she said to just stop sleeping. That feels impossible. 

Am I just lazy? What is going on?? Anyone experience the same thing?

Other notes I feel that are relevant:

* I do not involuntarily fall asleep.
* I am prescribed sertraline for depression, and it for sure works for all other symptoms I have so I am not completely convinced this is depression related.
* I exercise 3x a week and it does not seem to positively or negatively impact this sleep habit.

A Letter I won't send

Dear _ _ _ _
  
Now that enough time has passed, I want to tell you what I’ve learned and reflected upon in the months since. 

Your love never left me. I felt your absence every single day. I felt it in every morning, in every coffee, in every social interaction, and in every breath. Despite the difficulty, I continued living my life without you. I committed to sobriety and going to therapy. I often had a lingering sense of regret that I wasn’t able to commit to this for the benefit our relationship while we still had it. 

The love we had was beautiful, special, and raw, and it changed my life. It was ours, and it will continue to be even if time passes and our feelings towards each other and the relationship change. I also know that our love could be difficult and painful. I now believe that whenever we argued, both of us just wanted to be seen and acknowledged, but we were two different souls learning how to love and understand each other. 

Somehow, somewhere along the way, when one of us expressed how we felt and the other tried to understand, the message got lost in translation. For me, when I listened, I could only hear how inadequate I was and how I had to change. I always saw it as an argument and responded accordingly, instead of seeing it as an invitation to show me how my actions hurt you. I won’t justify my actions by blaming the insecurities from my past, the way you brought up these issues, or the emotions I had. I wasn’t the person you needed me to be, and I’m sorry. I could have changed, listened, and acknowledged you, but I didn’t. 

I also want to apologize for how I treated you during and after the relationship ended. While I’ve forgiven myself, I still want to express how sorry I am for my actions and their consequences. I wasn’t honest with you or with myself, I took you for granted, and I put my comfort, my happiness, and my fears before your needs. I continued to do this even after we broke up by not respecting your boundary of no contact. It was a difficult transition, and I’m sorry for the ways I tried to beg, bargain, guilt, or pressure you back into my life. 

In those moments, I didn’t understand why you left and how you could leave me with so little to hold onto. But I know that breakups are hard– it was both of our first real relationships and one of many firsts we held together. Although I held onto anger at the ways you ended the relationship, I’ve realized that you were doing what you felt was best for you and our relationship. 

In my healing journey, one of the most important lessons I learned was letting go of the illusion of control. I can’t rewrite the past or undo my mistakes. I can’t take back the ways I hurt you, even though I now understand why I did. And I can’t change how I behaved after we broke up. Every day, I have to live with the consequences of my actions. I can only acknowledge, forgive, and learn from these experiences. 

Similarly, I can’t change the way you acted. I can’t change the reality that you broke up with me or the way you did it. In the moment, and for months after, I wanted to keep trying and fix our mistakes, but you didn’t. All I can do is acknowledge the reality of our love– from the unexpected beginning to the painful end, for all of its beauty to all of its perfect imperfections. 

The final aspect I cannot control is the ending of our story. It might have already happened. We might walk our separate paths and slowly return to becoming strangers to each other– only this time, with a shared history of love. We might return to speaking terms once we’ve healed and be friendly with each other, though never once letting our defenses down again. We might try again and fail. We might grow old together and share our lives again.

I don’t know what will happen. This uncertainty is difficult to come to terms with, but it will teach me how to live in the moment. I have to learn to accept any outcome, no matter how painful or how much I want it to happen. While I can't write this to you, I'll write to the memory i have of you; the Josh i used to know. 

Thank you for everything. I love you. 


As messy as this room may look, I wish it still looked the same. I wish it was messier, I wish the pile on the floor was immovable, and the mirror was too heavy for 10 people to lift. I should have opted for the portraits on the walls to be cemented rather than nailed. I wish the vanity i always hated still needed to have the drawers pulled all the way out to realign them everyday. I wish it was just as bright there now. I wish I was still just as goofy and truly smile like that again one day. I wish the things you can't see were still there despite me wishing they never were. I wish i was still 15lbs heavier, maybe then it would be harder to push me aside. I can wish a million times but a wish, by definition, is just a desire that is not easily attainable; something that cannot or probably will not happen. I wish i didn't feel as overused as a word that's been coined dozens of times to describe the paradox of the world i've been living in. Nobody's given the guidelines on how to live life properly; we learn to walk by falling... what a contradiction. Perhaps the only rule that's for certain is there are no rules. You create the guidelines to your life just as much as you run headfirst into guideposts. I am truly remarkable and I am one of a kind - how lucky am I to feel so deeply through the small overlooked sentiments of this home. However, I keep in mind the major difference between who I am compared to these tender memories - they are replaceable. ",3,1748396348.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,4,0.67,False

Duties & Taxes (for Quebec) came out to **$93.43 CAD** 

Total = **$409.67 CAD**

While the bag was in transit, I got a few automated phone calls from FedEx telling me I had to pay duties and taxes. At first I thought it was a spam call but I went on the FedEx website and put in my tracking number into the duties and taxes section and it had a payment page (as seen in picture). Payed it off before I got the bag and it came exactly when it said it would.

Regarding non seriousness of Ellie and Dina:
EP3: I think it’s more realistic that Ellie and Dina continue to be themselves and not think about Joel every single moment until it matters like at his grave. Also not mentioned I thought putting coffee beans 🫘 on the grave and smiling was an inside joke about ground coffee and a nice touch. 

Regarding clothes: 
EP4: Even though they are in apocalypse, they’re coming from a well off town so I didn’t expect the clothes to be dirty or torn. However, at least some wrinkles, or dirt since they traveled there; regardless of if it was just in the backpack because regardless the “theme” of apocalypse still looks better in this type of show than nice clothes (even if it can be realistic they come from a well off town and not living out in wild). Sounds nitpick but this is important for audience to suspend disbelief. 

Also Dina should have said “I thought you were gonna die…I think I’m pregnant.” Since that explains her crying instead of “I’m pregnant” then making out. It’s bad timing and writing

EP5: More talking about what happened than showing. Budget saving? 

EP6: Back to the formula all of the fans wanted. Joel and Ellie on missions. Ppl actually don’t like that Ellie told the widow so fast about it, not giving her time to grieve. I get that Ellie had enough, but can see ppls complaints also. The final scene was phenomenal, and shows Bella is a good actress in emotional moments but not in action moments (such as facial expressions). 

EP7: Scars just letting Ellie go is ridiculous unless they excuse it with the ritual killing cop out. They would absolutely just kill her. Bad writing, at least let there be gunshots from Wolves where everyone scatters and Ellie escapes in the confusion. Not “LET HER GO”. 

The first time I played TLOU2, unbiased at first, I was pissed at the cliff hanger and literally speed ran Abby’s part before realizing after several f*cking hours (or whenever I realized it’s day 1 again) that I’m stuck as Abby. So now, unless you care about Kaitlyn Dever, season 3 will be a tough sell going through Abby’s story. I feel many won’t return until after the cliffhanger. 

Comparisons: 
All I have hope for, is that the walking dead series with Clementine is made, and they learn from this series about father/surrogate daughter adventure stories and that recaptures the magic of early seasons of TWD. I wanted TLOU show to capture that, and they sort of did in season 1, as much as I don’t dislike Bella, sometimes you need the right person with the right vibes for the role. Dina felt like the actual Ellie this season since episode 1. Imagine if Isabela was cast for Ellie. After initial race discussions, it would have been fine.",1,1748395971.0,TheLastOfUs2,0,1.0,False

Itinerary advice?","My partner and I are road tripping to Minnesota this year! Our travel style is simple - we like good food, good coffee shops, and walking around and exploring cities and parks to look at architecture and capture the vibe. We also like local museums on the cities/towns, but not necessarily art museums or things found in many other cities. We enjoy nature, but this is not a hiking trip. We are doing Minneapolis first to see the Twins, then Duluth.

Our trip is roughly from July 28-August 2 (five nights). I'm not sure whether to stay in Duluth or Minneapolis for three days

**Monday, July 28**: Drive 7 hours to Minneapolis, check in, and eat dinner.

**Tuesday, July 29:** Take in the city of Minneapolis by visiting parks, walking downtown, seeing the riverfront. Then, go to the Twins game at night (big baseball fans, so this is why we are doing Minneapolis first.

The trip opens up after that where we either spend an extra day in Minneapolis or head to Duluth. I don't know enough about Minneapolis to know if there's enough to do for another day I want to leave a day in Duluth to explore the town and check out the maritime visitors center and another day to drive the coast to Split Rock Lighthouse and Gooseberry Falls to do the three mile waterfall trek. However, I heard parking is overcrowded in summer and I worry about spending an extra day in Minneapolis and not being able to get in on a Friday, whereas if we leave Minneapolis early, we could do that on Thursday which might have less crowds. But maybe 3 nights in Duluth is too much, as there's less to do.

\
(Worthy Satire) - In a bold new prediction, Elon Musk proclaimed that by 2040, ""tens of billions"" of humanoid robots will populate the Earth — a number slightly higher than the planet’s total square footage and about 30 billion more than the current human population.\
\
“Humans are overworked,” Musk tweeted. “Robots don’t unionize, never need coffee breaks, and most importantly — they don’t launch three-hour podcasts about hustle culture.”\
\
Musk says the bots will be powered by Tesla software, run on Optimus energy cores, and come pre-installed with X Premium (formerly Twitter Blue) so they can argue with each other in real time.\
\
When asked if humanity might feel threatened, Musk replied, “Oh, I think humans just need a long-overdue break — maybe a few decades off while the robots handle things.”\
\
The World Economic Forum applauded the move, saying it would allow humans to “own nothing, do nothing, and finally relax” — all while quietly drafting plans to run the world unchallenged by a society too lazy to notice.\
\
As for Musk? He’s reportedly developing the next big leap: a more efficient, less sleep-deprived version of himself called eLon-2.0 — freeing up the original to finally focus on planning his long-awaited escape to Mars.\
\
“I’m tired,” he said. “Let the bots figure it out.”\
\

1kx4do9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperimentalCoffee/comments/1kx4do9/brew_recommendations_and_coffee_information/,Brew recommendations and coffee information: EXP005-7,"Hey folks,

Here are some thoughts on EXP005 - 007. 

These are all fresh crops from East Africa. I roasted these to highlight what I think coffees from these countries offer best: bright acidity, strong florals, and juicy fruits. These coffees offer these three characteristics in different ways. One challenge with roasting coffees from Africa is that the beans often come from many different farms. And as a result the bags we receive often contain many different varietals. The ""heirloom"" category in 007 represents this well. Heirloom or ""landrace"" is basically a term we use when we don't really know what varietal the plants are, or when there are too many to know. Contrast this with some of the coffees we source from Colombia which are often single varietal, single farm, and often the same lot processed differently. How this plays into roasting and brewing is this: Varietals roast differently. You'll notice some beans that are lighter and some that are darker and that's because the beans are actually different, both as raw coffee (which often has different colors from green to orange) and roasted coffee because of different sugar development. If you ever find yourself tasting lots of corn or barley, you can pick through a bag and remove some of the lightest roasts beans, or let the beans rest longer. 

Some specifics: The Zambia is the lightest roasted. Give it some time to rest, probably a week or two. It's got punchy acidity. If you don't prefer that, brew it closer to 1:16, a little coarser, and with a flat-bottom brewer. The Burundi is slightly darker but still pretty light. It's also very acidic when finer, closer to 1:15 and higher temps. I recommend a conical brewer unless, again, you find the acidity off-putting. The Ethiopia is more on the medium side of these (objectively still light). I've loved this coffee over the past two weeks. It can be very creamy when brewed at a lower temp and ratio closer to 1:15 and more florally, fruity closer to 1:16 and 202F. 

Hope you enjoy. Please send your feedback and reviews.

1kx49ps,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1kx49ps/dreamy_week_in_paris_in_may_highlights_and_tips/,Dreamy week in Paris in May: highlights and tips!,"My partner and I just got back from an absolutely wonderful week in Paris. Thank you so much to this group for helping us plan and for all the recommendations and insider tips. I wanted to share a few more lesser discussed tips and our top highlights! We traveled from the US, but we did not grow up in America, so we also have a lot of observations on how things differ in Paris from the US.

In terms of activities, we went to the Louvre, the Musee D'Orsay, and the Musee Carnavalet. We attended a day of the French Open's qualifying week, saw the Eiffel from the Trocadero and the Seine River Cruise, and climbed the Arc du Triomphe. We also went to the Catacombs, Sainte Chapelle, and Notre Dame, and did the Palais Garnier Mystery Tour. The rest of our time was spent wandering around different areas we picked each day.

  
**Getting around:**

* The Navigo Semaine Mon-Sun weekly pass is real value for money especially if you stay at least 5 days. It costs \~36 euros including the Navigo Decouverte card, and all you need to do is tap and go on either a bus or all metros/RERs. Bring a photo of yourself and a pen to sign your name. The photo is almost postage stamp sized, but can be printed on normal A4 paper and then cut and pasted.
* This group did not lie about the number of steps in metro stations or the amount of walking you do in a typical day. Despite a fairly flex and light schedule, we averaged 15-20k steps a day. Maybe 10% of the metro stations we used had functioning escalators.
* Trains are highly frequent and pretty punctual, especially the SNCF (TGV INOUI) we took on a day trip to Colmar. Buses are less frequent, and don't really match up to the Google Maps time estimate of when they will show up. 
* We walked a lot, and the city is very pedestrian friendly. However, both car drivers and bicyclists in this city are deranged. A car bumped into a bus we were in once, and I had to dodge multiple bicyclists at crosswalks. Also, the pedestrian crossing light changes from a green to a red instantly without a countdown like I am used to in the US. I had to occasionally jump back to safety after starting to cross because the light turned red unexpectedly. Parisians are expert at this though and seem to know exactly when to cross -- when in doubt just follow them! 

**Weather and clothes:**

* We were lucky to experience 5-6 days of sunny and dry weather, with rain only on 1.5 days. Temperature varies dramatically over a day, and with the presence of wind/sun/clouds. On most of our days in the middle of May, it went from 11 C when we stepped out in the morning to \~18-20 C noon onwards. This was perfect since we had early morning indoor activities scheduled on most mornings, so we walked around in lovely afternoon sun.
* Dressing in layers is definitely good advice, and seemed to be what most other tourists/locals did. We didn't want to walk around with big backpacks to store discarded layers though, so I just carried along one jacket and a scarf that fit in my pockets. I felt slightly chilly at times but nothing intolerable or uncomfortable. 
* Parisians are very well-dressed, but nothing too flashy or designer. I believe Uniqlo and basics from H&M/Zara type stores are popular, I saw lots of similar styles. Most Parisians dress ridiculously warm though -- especially older people, who wore an overcoat, scarf, and an inner layer even in 16 C weather. I felt like trench coats were mostly worn by tourists or in touristy areas, despite people on this group recommending them? The outfits I saw most often on women were jeans/trousers with a well-fitted wrinkle-free top in muted colors, a sturdy nice looking coat (no puffer or down jackets, unlike the US), and at least 1-2 pieces of jewelry. Scarves seem loved by people of all ages and genders, but berets are mostly worn by men. 
* Shoes of choice seemed to be comfy sneakers. I was very happy in my Asics with some thick socks, and I saw a lot of Adidas. Make sure your shoes are broken in! Your feet will not survive new shoes in this city.
* The day it rained was rather sad especially in the evening, as most of the fun shops and indoor activities are closed by 6. Wind makes walking around in the rain uncomfortable, so we went back to the hotel earlier than we wanted just for a lack of things to do. 

**Food and service:**

* Service staff were extremely kind and accommodating across the board. They tolerated our ""Bonjour, table for two please?"" with a smile, and were kind enough to speak in English and answer our questions. There was one waiter at Colmar who was a little rude and did not seem to like that we wanted vegetarian food, but every restaurant in Paris did their best to help us.
* We did not enjoy vegetarian *French* food, but had a great time trying north-african food like couscous (shoutout to L'Atlantide in the 19th!) as well as falafels and burgers in the Marais. Crepes and galettes were amazing, despite an unbelievable amount of butter on them. We also liked a vegetarian soufflé at Le Recamier in the 6th. The worst meal was at Bouillon Chartier were we were unfortunate enough to order the vegetarian lasagna. Dessert was amazing everywhere!
* I could rave about croissants and pastries for an entire post, these were one of the best parts of our trip. Although I usually get pain au chocolats, I tried plenty of butter croissants, almond croissant, pain au raisin on this trip and loved them all. My favorite pastries were the croissants from Brigat in the Marais, and the almond croissant and babka from Mamiche in the 10th. But I really think any random boulangerie or even a cafe would have incredible croissants -- we had an amazing one at the Peloton cafe despite it being bought elsewhere. The worst croissant was at the cafe in Louvre. Please eat breakfast before you visit so that you don't have to make the same mistake we did!
* I also loved tarts of all flavors, especially the lemon tart in various patisseries, and the strawberry+cream tart at Bulle boulangerie in the 19th. Bulle also had an incredible pain suisse that was made even more delicious by dipping it in black coffee. I loved the millefeuille, very new flavors and lovely puff pastry, but found the Paris-brest rather too sweet.
* We found the Parisians we interacted with to be super friendly and kind. Especially in restaurants where tables are close by, we found multiple locals smile and greet us when we sat at a nearby table, with some even starting up conversations. The only time we were awkwardly ignored was by an American family at Bouillon Chartier lol.
* In general, on metros and in cafes, we found many locals unabashedly looking at us, maybe because we stood out as tourists or were speaking in English. If we made eye contact, they would always smile and greet us, and even compliment us on our outfit. I also received friendly pats on the shoulder from elderly French people (this happened 3 times, twice on metros!), which was strange but sweet. 

**Stay:**

* We stayed in the Marais, <20 mins walk from the Notre Dame. Since it was our first visit to Paris, we wanted to stay central despite it being a touristy location. I found it to be super lively. Music and laughter beyond 2 AM, which is very unusual in the US, but I loved every bit of it (and was tired enough each night to sleep through the merriment!)
* Our hotel was old and rather run down, but the housekeeping staff did a great job of keeping it clean and comfy. Most hotels I travel to in the US only offer housekeeping on request or once every 3 days, so it was nice to come home to a made bed and clean towels every night. Despite the tiny lobby, the staff were happy to store our bags on our last day after check-out.
* Water temperature and pressure is excellent; even better than my apartment back home. Hotel bathrooms seem to provide a hand-held shower, which was great for my tired feet at the day's end. 
* Rooms are small, and bathrooms are even smaller. I am used to setting out all my toiletries and skin care out on bathroom counters at US hotels, and that wasn't possible here. Charging ports for electronics were also limited.
* We moved to a place in the 19th for the last two days to meet some friends. This was a quieter, more local neighborhood, and we loved hanging out at the Parc des Buttes Chaumont and watching the morning runners.

**Safety:**

* I know that petty crime is an issue, but I think some of the concerns online are exaggerated. It led me to expect pretty awful things like purses being cut or my phone being grabbed from my hands, and by the second day I realized that my concerns were waaaay overblown. I saw no petty crime or sketchy people in most tourist areas I went to except Montmartre, not even scammers.
* I was super cautious on the metro but this was also fine. Nobody brushed up against anyone in sus ways trying to pick their pocket. In fact, most trains had enough space that I actually took a seat safely, even on the Sunday evening train to the Eiffel tower.  
* The shadiest part of the city in my experience was the Gare du Nord area. I noticed at least two people looking at my bag, and one man subtly got in between me and my partner on the metro stairs. I stopped and stared at him until he let me pass and rejoin my partner. On the train from Gare du Nord, there was a man who was speaking loudly and threateningly to a girl. I did not understand the conversation but I think they had a personal history as the man didn't interact with anyone else. Either way this was the most unsettling incident I witnessed during the whole trip.
* The city is pretty clean in most touristy areas, and only smelled funky in a few metro stations. There was also a very sketchy, dark, stinky tunnel we walked by in the 19th, but I think this was our fault for not checking the navigation properly. Unless you're going somewhere really random, I think it's definitely possible to walk through lively places even at night in most parts of the city.

**Highlights:**

* Sainte Chapelle is truly stunning and definitely worth a visit. We had 9 AM tickets, got in the queue at 9:10, and were inside and past security by 9:30 max. 
* At the Louvre, we followed the [Louvre's masterpieces](https://www.louvre.fr/en/explore/visitor-trails/the-louvre-s-masterpieces/ancient-masterpieces-from-the-royal-collections) tour which was a perfect amount of art to take in within about 3-4 hours without being totally overwhelmed. The winged victory took my breath away, and my favorite was probably the sculpture of Psyche and Cupid. We entered at 9 AM, but went to the Sully wing rather than Denon like everyone else which was a good decision. We walked into the Caryatids room and the Venus de Milo room when it was completely empty. The couture exhibit at the Louvre is very well organized and lots of fun. I'm sure we saw <5% of the total collection, but we'll save the rest for subsequent visits.
* The mystery tour at the Palais Garnier is beyond stunning. We had a funny and passionate guide who pointed out designs that I would never have thought to notice, like the reflection of lamps in the Sun room. It was also a great way to get pictures of the building without any crowds. Note: arrive 15-20 minutes early and go collect your audio headset from the counter in front.
* There is music everywhere in this charming city. At Marche Mouffetard on Sunday morning, multiple bands were playing jazz-y music and locals were dancing along in the square. We also saw amazing musicians multiple times on the bridges from Ile de la Cite to the right bank. 
* Musee D'Orsay was wonderful and made for a better experience than the Louvre because of the layout and beauty of the building itself, and the relatively smaller crowds. I followed the 1 hour [Rick Steves tour](https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/audio/audio-tours/paris) which gave context to a lot of the major works. I loved the Van Gogh room and Manet's Olympia. 
* Place des Vosges was a <5 min walk from our hotel and kind of became our neighborhood park. So many picnickers lounging on the grass and benches made it feel homey and lovely. I didn't visit any other famous parks like Luxembourg gardens, but honestly the tiny square parks nestled within busy streets are the best parts of Paris: even more perfect with a croissant! And when I say square I mean *square*, they really love their symmetry in this city.
* Canal St Martin is beautiful. We loved watching the boats go under the locks, and checking out the amazing asian restaurants nearby. Also, it seems like this area is where young locals hang out. Although I loved the streets and cafes in the central arrondisements, it seemed like those places were filled with either tourists or older people. 
* I loved going on the TGV train to Colmar. The train was way faster than I expected, and went through beautiful green fields and I even saw some mountains in the distance. Colmar was an enchanting little town with not much to do, but it was great to just walk around and take pictures and shop.
* I liked picking up a few French words over the week and eavesdropped on many conversations just to hear French being spoken. It sounds beautiful but is so hard to speak! Also, I found it so adorable hearing children speak French. They don't speak as fast as the adults and it sounds super cute and babble-like.

**Lowlights:**

* Notre Dame: it's obviously a beautiful and imposing cathedral, but it was so busy that it barely felt like a place of worship. The crowd was fast moving, and we ended up joining the queue totally unplanned, but were left disappointed by how it made us feel. In contrast, random smaller churches I walked in to were much more peaceful and mysterious in addition to the beautiful architecture. 
* Montmartre was overwhelming on the Friday evening we went there. Except for Rue de l'Abreuvoir, which felt like something out of a storybook, the crowds and sketchy people near the hill were a little off-putting. Maybe a morning visit would be easier!
* I was disappointed by queueing etiquette in several places I went to, but Roland Garros more than anywhere else. I believe these were French visitors, not tourists. It felt like groups of people would just stand next to each other rather than behind one another, totally disrespecting where you stand in the queue, and even nudging you out passive aggressively if you were a pushover. Don't know if this is a big city thing or a French thing, but it annoyed me when it happened.
* The line for tax refunds at CDG was wild, and we chose to forego \~$20 rather than waste what seemed to be at least an hour standing behind like 50 people.
* Restaurants: this is not a lowlight but a word of caution. Do some research on where to eat, and even research specific dishes if you have dietary restrictions. We had some bad experiences at Google Maps suggested highly-rated places and underwhelming experiences at places suggested by famous youtubers (Les Frenchies). We did eat lots of amazing food overall though, so this was just a lesson for next time! 
* I had mixed feelings about the Catacombs and thought the tickets were overpriced. I can see how some people may like it, but it made an otherwise nice day very depressing and I couldn't wait for it to be over.



Sorry for this insanely long post, but TLDR: Paris is magical with lovely people and food and I cannot wait to visit again. The monuments and attractions were obviously wonderful, but the quiet charm of ordinary streets is what made the city extraordinary to us. ",38,1748394518.0,ParisTravelGuide,5,1.0,False
1kx49ls,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1kx49ls/possible_root_canal/,Possible root canal?,"I (31F) have been getting some dental work done this year. I had a baby in 2023 and have not had great experiences/luck with dentists since moving, so I fell behind on my cleanings. I have cavities between all molars, so we’ve been doing the fillings by quadrant. 5 weeks ago they did my upper left side and I’ve been back 3 times because we can’t figure out why I can’t chew still. I’ve had the bite adjusted twice and last week they did a full work up that resulted in no real answers. Tooth 13 is my problem tooth, and was very reactive to the cold test and lingered the longest by far. Tooth 14 hurt when they tapped the bottom, but was otherwise fine. They did multiple X-rays and all he could determine was that the cavity on 13 *might* be deeper and nearing the root, but he won’t know for sure until he goes back into the tooth. So the plan would be to remove the filling and drill back into the tooth, possibly resulting in a root canal. Does that make sense? I haven’t had any issues until now with my teeth, so this is foreign territory, but a possible root canal has me stressed. The tooth looks normal and my gums aren’t tender or sensitive. I do grind my teeth according to my X-rays and I started using a temporary mouth guard over the weekend to see if that gave me any relief and seems to have helped a little, but the cold sensitivity is still very much there.
